Iran may put the US military on its terror list if Washington designates the Iranian elite Revolutionary Guards as terrorists, a senior Iranian lawmaker said on Saturday.
The United States is expected to designate the Revolutionary Guards a foreign terrorist organisation, three US officials told Reuters, marking the first time Washington has formally labeled another country’s military a terrorist group.
“If the Revolutionary Guards are placed on America’s list of terrorist groups, we will put that country’s military on the terror blacklist next to Daesh,” Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, head of parliament’s national security committee, said on Twitter."
Upcoming 2020 Candidate Town Hall Events on CNN and Fox News,www.uspresidentialelectionnews.com,Nate Ashworth,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.uspresidentialelectionnews.com/2019/04/upcoming-2020-candidate-town-hall-cnn-fox-news/,"Upcoming 2020 Candidate Town Hall Events on CNN and Fox News Here's the upcoming town hall schedule for your viewing pleasure By 0
Cable news channels hosting “Town Hall” events with 2020 candidates has become all the rage lately. CNN did several of them over the last two months, almost to the point that they’re hard to keep track of.
Apparently, the events have been ratings winners because CNN is slated to host five more candidates next week. Fox News is even getting in on the town hall action hosting Bernie Sanders on April 15, live from Pennsylvania. Upcoming Candidate Town Halls -Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (10 pm ET, 7 pm PT) Wednesday, April 10 -Gov. Jay Inslee (10 pm ET, 7 pm PT) Thursday, April 11 -Julian Castro (10 pm ET, 7 pm PT) Sunday, April 14 -Marianne Williamson (7 pm ET, 4 pm PT) -Andrew Yang (8 pm ET, 5 pm PT)
Fox News Monday, April 15 -Bernie Sanders (6:30 pm ET, 3:30 pm PT)
Bernie’s decision to give time to Fox News didn’t come without criticism from some Democrats, of course:
The announcement that Fox News would host Sanders received some backlash. Ian MIllhiser, a columnist with the liberal news site ThinkProgress, tweeted a link to the release with the comment, “WTF is Bernie doing?”
The Democratic National Committee also released a statement concerning Bernie’s decision to appear on Fox:
“The DNC believes that we must reach all voters, including (the Fox) audience,” said party spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa, who is among the handful of aides to party Chairman Tom Perez coordinating 2020 debate plans. “Candidates should do what they need to do in order to engage these voters directly.”
Well, if they believe they must reach all voters, including viewers of Fox News then why would they ban Fox from hosting any Democratic debates? It’s a sticky situation for the DNC, but Fox says they have more Town Hall events in the works with other Democratic candidates.
On Thursday night, Fox News hosted former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz as a potential independent presidential candidate. Newsweek offers this report on Schultz’s performance and his appeal to voters:
Schultz dove deep into the issues instead of merely scratching the surface. He supports part of the left and part of the right. He also opposes radical ideas from both sides of the political aisle.
He said Democrats and Republicans have radically veered too far left and right, respectively, and that bickering between the two major political parties is at an all-time high.
“I’m 65, and I’ve never witnessed such a divide,” said Schultz, who’s consdiering a presidential run as an independent. “Both parties have gone so far extreme in their ideology.”
He supports strong border protection and funding for immigration enforcement, and he supports higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. He wants health care for all, but wants 180 million people to keep their private insurance. He is pro-choice when it comes to abortion, and he doesn’t think reparations to descendants of slaves is a correct answer.
Schultz didn’t just draw a thin line in the sand between the left and right Thursday night in Kansas City. He made a strong case for a run as an independent, and he may have even hinted he’s ready to run.
I remain unconvinced that Schultz will pull the trigger on a campaign, but anything is possible in the current political climate. He’s being attacked by Democrats who fear he would hurt their chances against Donald Trump, but analysis shows he would probably end up hurting both parties as his views tend to bridge the political divide on many topics.
If you’re interested in hearing from individual candidates, a Town Hall event will be much more informing than a debate. When given enough time on questions for an hour of so, candidates can offer longer answers and better inform voters about where they stand on the issues.
With the likelihood of 20 or so candidates on a debate stage , voters won’t learn much other than how well each candidate can perform fighting for sheer seconds of time to answer rapid-fire questions. TAGS"

Plastic Bag Ban Will Put Los Angeles In Landfill - Reason.com,reason.com,Jay Beeber,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/archives/2012/05/23/plastic-bag-ban-will-put-los-angeles-in,"There’s a crisis in Los Angeles. Is it the city’s projected $250 million budget deficit? The city’s $10 billion shortfall in pension obligations? Its crumbling infrastructure? A public school dropout rate approaching 50 percent? No, the City of Angels is facing catastrophe in the form of grocery bags.

Regulation Bankrupt Cities Los Angeles Environmentalism Small Business Cities Local Government Competition California Business And Industry Great Recession So great is the menace that the City Council is poised to impose on the good people of Los Angeles the country’s strictest grocery bag ban, prohibiting the distribution of both plastic and paper bags.
Proponents give three reasons for the bag ban. They claim it will reduce the amount of waste entering landfills, reduce litter on streets, and “help protect the environment.”
But banning free grocery bags will not achieve those lofty goals.
First, banning free plastic grocery bags won’t reduce waste. California’s Statewide Waste Characterization Study [ pdf ] shows that “Plastic Grocery and Other Merchandise Bags” consistently make up just 0.3 percent of the waste stream in the state. That’s three-tenths of 1 percent. In comparison, organic waste such as food and yard clippings makes up 32 percent while construction debris comprises about 30 percent. The effect of eliminating free grocery bags on the amount of waste generated in the city would be insignificant.
Second, despite misleading claims from environmental groups and the L.A. Bureau of Sanitation, banning free plastic grocery bags won’t do much to reduce litter in the public commons. Litter studies from across the country demonstrate that, on average, plastic retail bags make up about 1 percent to 2 percent of all litter.
Even that small amount of litter doesn’t decline when bans are enacted. In San Francisco, plastic bags comprised 0.6 percent of litter before the city banned plastic bags and 0.64 percent a year after the ban took effect [ pdf , pg. 35]. Since plastic grocery bags make up less than 2 percent of roadside trash, banning them will affect neither the total amount of litter nor the cost of cleaning it up.
Third, banning free plastic grocery bags won’t reduce our consumption of foreign (or domestic) oil. L.A.’s Bureau of Sanitation claims [ pdf ] that “approximately 12 million barrels of oil go into the US supply of plastic bags.” But plastic bags made in the U.S. are not derived from oil; they’re made from a byproduct of domestic natural gas refinement. Manufacturing plastic grocery bags does not increase our need to import oil, and banning them in Los Angeles or anywhere else will not reduce US oil consumption.
Despite claims that plastics threaten our oceans and sea life, there is no evidence that free plastic grocery bags make up any significant portion of the plastic waste found on beaches or in the ocean. In fact, reports from environmental groups doing beach and ocean clean-ups show that plastic bags make up only about 2 percent of the debris ."

Source: AP Photo/Paul Sancya Sidelined Because She Rejects Radical Green Agendas? America’s thriving economy is showing the rest of the world that capitalism remains the most effective economic system known to man. The U.S. stock market just posted its biggest quarterly gains in a decade, as investors were comforted by the appointment of Trump ally Stephen Moore to the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. Moore is a tax-cutter who helped write President Trump’s broadly successful tax reform, and he’s expected to resist calls for the Fed to raise interest rates while the economy continues its recovery from the Great Recession. This news contrasted with continued global weakness , including disappointing reports on manufacturing in Asia and Europe. In Germany, declining exports have coincided with an economic slowdown in China, which is Germany’s largest trading partner. View Cartoon Meanwhile, Brexit difficulties continue to paralyze the U.K., and the French are still rebelling over President Emmanuel Macron’s unforgivable socialist tax hikes. Further depressing the global economy is the lack of growth in Japan, due to weakness in exports and lackluster economic recovery. Yet, while manufacturing is contracting elsewhere, it continues to expand in the U.S. The Institute for Supply Management’s index of national factory activity surged to 55.3 in March, an increase of 1.1 over February, and nearly a full point higher than economists had predicted. Americans continue to enjoy historically low unemployment across all socioeconomic levels, so much so that other countries are now attempting to revive their own economies with bold, effective, Trumpian corporate tax reductions. And when Americans are working, their outlook improves. A recent CNN poll found that 71 percent of respondents say the U.S. economy is solid, which is the highest level of economic optimism in 18 years. Most of those surveyed approve of President Trump’s economic policies and the poll showed his approval rating has climbed to 42 percent as Americans realize that his capitalist policies are working for them. In fact, America is one of the only industrialized countries that continues to enjoy strong growth thanks to President Trump’s commitment to deregulation and adherence to free-market policies. It’s good news for the Trump economy too that the Fed announced that it will forestall planned interest rate hikes in the near future, removing a major source of economic uncertainty. Plus, Steve Moore’s appointment to the Fed will further solidify support for an accommodative monetary policy that works in tandem with the President’s pro-growth policies. Going forward, investors are optimistic that President Trump will continue to push back on socialist policies while giving capitalism the freedom to flourish. It also appears that a trade deal with China is forthcoming, as evidenced by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin’s meeting in China , giving investors further cause for optimism. Less than three years ago, China was pirating U.S. inventions without limit; now we’re on the verge of a historic agreement to open up China’s markets to free, fair, and reciprocal competition. Recommended Democrat Presidential Conference Opens with Communist Cop-Killer’s Chants Humberto Fontova President Trump has been an unwavering champion of capitalism in the White House, and the effectiveness of his pro-growth agenda is showing that capitalism is still the surest route to prosperity.

Donald Trump Ivanka Trump Conflicts Of Interest Business And Industry Trade/Globalization Crony Capitalism Executive Power Presidential Power Favoritism Foreign Aid ""Conflict of interest!"" they protest. ""Conflict of interest!"" They then set off on an inquiry into how such conflicts can be prevented, an effort beset by a growing sense that nothing can be done about the problem.
They are justified in that sense of futility because within the range of options they would consider acceptable , nothing can be done.
Ivanka Trump is a federal worker, albeit at a salary of zero. But it would make no difference if she had no job in the White House because she would still be the president's daughter and that's not going to change. Any foreign leader—or anyone else, for that matter—who wants to curry favor with President Trump can easily calculate that doing something nice for his daughter at least can't hurt. After all, she doesn't have to be a Special Adviser to the President to be a special adviser to her father, the president. And if she is talking to her father about the country, her comments could be colored—even unconsciously—by her business interests. But even if they were not, Trump himself, who is famously a sucker for flattery and, presumably, for praise for his family, might be influenced by the kindness of strangers.
So how can conflicts of interest be avoided? It would be unreasonable to demand that Ivanka Trump divest herself of her company and have no business interests: she does have rights. She no longer manages her company, but she still holds a stake, even if she has put her assets into a trust. Moreover, she also has resigned as executive vice president of the Trump Organization and sold her common stock in it.
CNNMoney reported that her lawyer says that ""Ivanka Trump has converted her stake in her father's company into fixed payments, which means she can't benefit from the financial performance of the Trump Organization…. At the White House, Ivanka Trump's role will be to advise her father and concentrate on issues related to women in the workplace, child care, parental leave and job training, [the lawyer] said."" In another story CNNMoney reported that Ivanka's lawyer ""said her client would recuse herself from certain policy matters, like trade agreements, that are specific enough to affect her line of clothing and accessories.""
But, as I said, this makes no difference whatever. People seeking Trump's good will might still think it advantageous to direct benefits to Trump family business interests. Even with her reduced roles, Ivanka Trump surely wants to see her company and the Trump Organization prosper.
So we appear to be stuck with four to eight years of potential conflicts of interest. We'll never know if decisions coming out of the executive branch were ultimately influenced by conduct calculated to please Trump.
But maybe all is not so hopeless after all. Recall that I said the pundit class knows no solution that it would regard as acceptable . That leaves open the possibility of a solution that is un acceptable to them. ""Unacceptable,"" however, does not necessarily mean unreasonable.
The heart of the potential for conflicts of interests is not the Trumps' business empire. Rather it's presidential power to steer benefits to particular interests. So the surest way to eliminate the potential for conflicts is to eliminate the president's power to steer benefits to anyone. This would include not only favors granted by executive action but also those that a president can push through Congress.
Here we have an analogy with campaign finance. Those who fret over that issue don't want to understand that no one would make mega-contributions to candidates if officeholders had no favors to sell. Who shops where there's nothing to buy? By the same token, no one will do favors for a presidential daughter if the president has nothing to bestow in return.
If politicians could not impose trade restrictions (and therefore could not selectively lift them either) or provide foreign aid or grant any of the other favors the government today can grant, we wouldn't have to worry about conflicts of interest.
Of course, the people who do worry are the same ones who think the government should have the power to do all those things — and more. They want to have their cake and eat it too. But they can't because logic is logic.
This may sound like a call for ""limited government,"" but that's just a slogan. In the real world, states seek missions and expand. Therefore, nothing less than abolition will do.

Donald Trump Barack Obama Presidential Power It was creepy when former President Barack Obama declared his first Inauguration Day as ""National Day of Renewal and Reconciliation"" and called upon us to find ""common purpose of remaking this nation for our new century."" And it's creepy when President Donald Trump declares his Inauguration Day as ""National Day of Patriotic Devotion,"" one in which ""a new national pride stirs the American soul and inspires the American heart.""
This kind of self-aggrandizement is what you see under cults of personality, not American republicanism. Far be it from me to lecture anyone on how to love their country, but if your devotion to America is contingent upon the party or the person in office, you're probably not doing it quite like the Founding Fathers envisioned. It's bad enough that these inaugurations are treated as coronations. It can't be patriotic to treat politicians like quasi-religious figures. Moreover, this kind of devotional ties patriotism—either implicitly or in some cases rather explicitly—to a preferred set of policy initiatives or a political office.
We just survived eight years of a messianic presidency with a finger-wagging, patriotism-appropriating administration lecturing us on how to be proper Americans. If you didn't support the administration's point of view, then-Vice President Joe Biden might accuse you of ""betting against America.""
""What we need as a nation,"" then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew wrote to Congress in 2014, echoing the president, ""is a new sens e of economic patriotism, where we all rise or fall together."" Was Lew talking about our unalienable right of free expression? No, he was talking about punishing America-based companies that were trying to lower their tax burden, which happens to be one of the highest rates in the free world.
By the way, if we're going to play this game, avoiding excessive taxation is also one of the most American things we can do.
So it was creepy when Obama was trying to replace American idealism with progressivism and calling it ""economic patriotism,"" and it's creepy when Trump does basically the same thing under the guise of economic nationalism.
Now, judging from the campaign rhetoric, failing to support tariffs or other counterproductive ""buy American"" economic policies will have you branded seditious over the next four years. Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who probably had something to do with the devotion executive order, has referred to himself as an ""economic nationalist,"" a loaded term that means you only love your country if you support mercantilism.
Economic nationalists rely on a populism that lays blame on others—Mexico, China, whoever—for American problems. It's a philosophy, if we trust Bannon or Trump, that values power over most principles, including liberty. It's a philosophy that sounds like many things, none of them American patriotism.
The idea is amorphous, but patriotism, especially in this country, is driven by idealism rather than chauvinism, ethnicity or ""power."" As George Orwell famously noted, nationalism isn't the same as patriotism. In the American sense, patriotism is a fidelity to a place and the Constitution and is by nature ""defensive, both militarily and culturally."" Nationalism, on the other hand, ""is inseparable from the desire for power."" A devotional to our ""new national pride"" strongly hints at the latter.
You can hate your president and love your country. You can hope your president fails and still be patriotic. We don't always have a shared purpose. That's because presidents are not only commanders in chief but also politicians with agendas. And sometimes those agendas clash with your worldview. Let's not have devotionals venerating their ascendency every four years.

“We Can’t Take You Anymore”: Trump Says US Is “Full” During Border Speech,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/we-cant-take-you-anymore-trump-says-us-is-full-during-border-speech.html,"Zero Hedge April 6, 2019
Hours after California and 19 other states filed a lawsuit to try and stop President Trump from appropriating funds for his border wall via his national emergency declaration, President Trump flew to Calexico for a press conference with immigration agents and border patrol officials that was tantamount to flipping a giant middle finger to the state’s recently inaugurated, rapidly anti-Trump governor, Gavin Newsom. Not to mention California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has repeatedly challenged the Trump administration on immigration-related issues.
Bolstered by a flurry of news stories about the rapidly deteriorating situation at the border, which is being exacerbated by an unprecedented surge in the number of asylum seekers from Central America, Trump declared that at least 400 miles of his promised wall would be built over the next two years, and blamed Democrats for the slow progress so far. Trump has been pushing Congress to tighten asylum rules, to make it harder for migrants to qualify.
Notably, his visit came a day after he withdrew his nominee to lead ICE, the longtime border official Ron Vitiello, who had appeared to be on track for confirmation until Trump decided he wanted to go in a “tougher direction.”
He also repeated his explanation for backing off his threat to close the border, saying that Mexico has been cracking down on migrants traveling through its territory, and reiterated his threat to tariff auto parts and close the border if significant progress hasn’t been made in a year, according to the Associated Press.
During the press conference, Trump shared a message to migrants that he described as “our new statement,” and warned anyone traveling to the US – whether it’s to declare asylum, or enter illegally – to instead “turn around.”
“This is our new statement- the system is full. We can’t take you anymore. Whether it’s asylum or anything you want – illegal immigration – we can’t take you anymore. Our country is full. Our area is full. The sector is full. Can’t take you anymore, I’m sorry. Turn around.”
During the meeting, Trump was presented with a piece of the future border wall.
Unsurprisingly, the president’s visit triggered Gov. Newsom to condemn the president’s efforts to shut down immigration,.
“Since our founding, this country has been a place of refuge – a safe haven for people fleeing tyranny, oppression and violence. His words show a total disregard of the Constitution, our justice system, and what it means to be an American,” said Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Ocasio-Cortez: Draft ‘All Genders’ for the Military,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/ocasio-cortez-draft-all-genders-for-the-military.html,"Breitbart April 6, 2019
The Pentagon should draft all “genders,” not just men and women, according to New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
She casually spotlighted her revolutionary rejection of biology, sex, and the male-or-female society during a live Facebook chat in which she was asked about her views on the military draft. “As long as we have a draft, I support people of all genders being drafted,” she said.
Male and female are the two sexes — but transgender advocates now claim more than 50 “genders” — including agender, bigender, gender fluid, gender non-conforming, genderqueer, intersex, two-spirit, etc, plus “cis-gender” for the 99+ percent of people who are normal, non-transgender people.

The Reasons Behind The Relentless Ideological Onslaught Against Free Markets,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/the-reasons-behind-the-relentless-ideological-onslaught-against-free-markets.html,"Alt-Market.com April 6, 2019
I sometimes think that the free market concept is treated like The Hunchback of Notre-Dame’s Quasimodo in the long novel of global economic history.
It is considered ugly and undesirable by most people who judge it at a mere glance without bothering to understand it. It is a bogeyman; a scapegoat for numerous societal problems that it has nothing to do with. In reality, the only time free markets do cause trouble is when they are manipulated or misused by elitists seeking to turn them into something other than free markets. And, even when free markets display their great value and internal beauty, many still prefer other systems that are intrinsically corrupt but flashier on the surface.
There are many reasons behind this persistent attitude. However, they are not coincidental or natural. Human beings actually tend to gravitate toward free markets over and over again in history, and away from centralized government interference and dominance in economic trade. But whenever they do, they get hammered down by the-powers-that-be. In our modern era, establishment elites have chosen to be more subtle (for now) and dissuade people from free markets through disinformation and propaganda.
To break it all down to a simple observation – Whenever disaster strikes economically, free markets are blamed. Whenever something is fixed, even if that fix is a temporary band-aid on a sucking chest wound, government involvement and socialism are applauded. And so the cycle continues until free markets become a pariah with no place in our world and centralization becomes the prevailing answer to everything.
Free market trade is ever present at a local level and always has been. But, those who favor globalism are hell-bent on putting an end to any and all private unregulated commerce forever.
Before the increased lockdown in the 20th century, domestic trade in the U.S. was loosely regulated, if at all. The income tax didn’t exist, except for a trial run during the Civil War which was eventually repealed. There was no permanent central bank managed by unaccountable elites arbitrarily dictating interest rates or inflating the economy through asset purchases. Businesses were formed around partnerships which were limited in their scope, and while government grants and aid were afforded to some of these partnerships (as during the construction of the transcontinental railroad), these grants or bonds had an expiration date set for the moment the job was completed. At that point, the partnerships were dissolved and the company heads were expected to pay back the government on the grants given.
This is not to say that corruption in business did not exist pre-20th century; it certainly did. And in most cases this corruption was fueled by collusion between business moguls and government officials. Without the aid of government (the opposite of free markets) such criminal companies and monopolies cannot exist. A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The suppression of free markets began in the aftermath of the Civil War and the passage of the 14th Amendment, which was intended to protect the citizenship rights of former slaves, but was instead used as a legal loophole by the elite to establish what we now know as “corporations”.
Corporations are defined by their corporate charter, which is granted by the government, as well as their “corporate personhood” derived from the exploitation of the 14th Amendment. Corporate personhood allowed for limited liability as well as many other government protections. Unlike partnerships, leaders of corporations cannot in many cases be prosecuted criminally and their personal assets are protected if those crimes were executed by “the company”. There are exceptions in history, but how often do you see corporate CEO’s prosecuted and suffer anything more than a slap on the wrist?
The company can be sued as a “legal person” in civil court, or fined by the government, but in general CEO’s and major shareholders are protected from any consequences, even if they were directly involved in the commission of a crime.
This relationship between government and corporations has become so egregious that today these monopolies receive special legal protections and immunity from some civil lawsuits, aid in the form of taxpayer funded welfare, massive tax cuts which smaller businesses and less connected corporations do not enjoy, and even central bank bailouts which keep them afloat. Major corporations are not allowed to fail, and no one is allowed to compete with them on a level playing field.
This is the exact antithesis to free markets. This is socialism. Yet many socialists point the finger at free market “capitalism” as the source of all our economic problems. This is impossible, because free markets on a level any higher than local trade do not exist today and have not existed for at least a century.
Another often misrepresented part of the free market mythos is that free markets are amoral creations that must be allowed to evolve without any oversight or conscience. This claim is sometimes made by a subset of people who say they are free market activists, but do not understand free markets in the slightest.
A soulless economic model is not what “Wealth of Nations” writer Adam Smith originally envisioned. Smith was a staunch advocate of an inherent moral compass as a guide for society. He was also highly distrustful of elitist philosophy, and saw it as a control mechanism designed to convince the public that their everyday experiences and instinctual judgments were “inadequate”; meaning, people should set aside their voice of conscience and let the system tell them what they should think and do.
What Smith asserted was that while people often act in their own best interest, they will generally do so while still adhering to a universal moral compass. They will seek success through hard work and endeavor (as they should be allowed to do), but the notion that people will naturally destroy everything and everyone around them in the process unless they are heavily governed is a propaganda argument with no basis in reality. This claim persists today and is still the primary argument used against freedom in trade.
There is a group of people that do behave in a destructive way automatically or instinctually when engaging in commerce without regulation, and these people have become a fascination of mine. They are narcissistic sociopaths; the defining characteristic of most financial and political elites.
I have outlined the facts surrounding narcissistic sociopaths in numerous articles, and I recommend readers study these for greater details. To summarize, full blown narcissistic sociopathy is a psychological aberration present in around 1% of any given population from birth. That is to say, in most cases these people are not created by their environment. Many of them come from very balanced and sheltered childhoods. They are born the way they are.
Narcissistic sociopaths are a tiny portion of the population, but lacking any sense of empathy or conscience, they account for a vast percentage of all crimes committed in society. They also gravitate to positions of power and influence from the business world to politics.
Most of the criticisms of Smith’s model for free markets revolve around the crimes of corporations (which are anti-free market) as well as the immoral behavior of narcissistic sociopaths. When one applies the free market idea to normal people, it works. When one applies it to narcissistic sociopaths, it doesn’t. My question is this – Is the best solution to remove free markets for everyone? Or, is the best solution to remove narcissistic sociopaths from positions of power and influence within free markets?
Establishment elites want us to believe that the former solution is the only solution, and with good reason. All centralization starts with economic centralization. Trade is the lifeblood of civilization, and if you can control the mechanisms of trade, you can potentially control an entire nation, or even the entire world. Free markets are a cure for the cancer of corporatism and socialism, and all they require is that people start participating in commerce without the consent or oversight of government. This is a difficult thing to stop when it gets started.
This is why the establishment is so obsessed with converting to a cashless society in which every transaction no matter how small is tracked and vetted . This is why governments are enacting harsher and harsher penalties for anyone doing business without their explicit approval. This is why government taxation and regulation is making small business ventures more difficult. And, it is why law enforcement officers are being encouraged by bureaucrats to write tickets punishing children selling lemonade on street corners. We are being conditioned to avoid attempting free market trade.
The final and most prolific attack on free markets is the use of the “greater enemy” and the “greater good” as props to undermine positive views of free markets. For example, a common argument against free markets relies on the idea that if people are allowed to pursue commerce unregulated, they would devour the Earth’s resources and destroy it in the process. While we have already seen some of the environmental damage done by the corporatocracy and the sociopathic people that control it, most of these crimes go unpunished despite considerable regulation.
How long have companies like Monsanto operated with impunity under the protection of government? Only recently in civil courts has this company finally had to pay for some of its crimes. But will a single Monsanto CEO or major shareholder go to jail for poisoning the ecosystem or giving people cancer? I doubt it.
The claim of the socialists and environmentalists that more government will save us from bad corporate practices is observably not true. Government and corporations work together to protect their fellow narcissistic sociopaths. More government means more corporate and elitist power. There is not a socialist nation on the planet that has not suffered this outcome.
I agree with Adam Smith in the idea that normal citizens will act to pursue success, but also to pursue balance. When given the opportunity to actually function within a true free market, most people are not going to destroy their surrounding environment and resources in some mad dash for gain. Why? Because it is in their self-interest not to. They know that if they abuse the structures around them they will lose their source of commerce. They know that if they ruin the system for others they will be shunned in business. They also know that if they fail in such a spectacular manner and commit criminal sabotage of the free market system they will have to suffer the regret and shame that will follow.
The only factor that this does not apply to are the elites themselves; the narcissistic sociopaths devoid of conscience with whom we now contend for our freedoms. I would suggest that Smith’s free markets, unshackled from centralization and government interference, would function almost perfectly if these people were cut from the equation entirely.

SPLC Director Threatens To Call Police On Reporter Over Questions About Sexual Harassment Allegation,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/splc-director-threatens-to-call-police-on-reporter-over-questions-about-sexual-harassment-allegation.html,"Daily Caller April 6, 2019
Two of the remaining top-level staff at the embattled Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) threatened to call the police on a Daily Caller reporter on Thursday, as he tried to ask about their knowledge of sexual harassment by Morris Dees.
<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>
Heidi Beirich and Maureen Costello, Director of the Intelligence Project and Teaching Tolerance respectively, were spotted in downtown DC, coming in and out of the Daily Caller’s building throughout the day. Costello took over the Teaching Tolerance project in 2010, and Beirich joined the SPLC back in 1999.
The board and senior leadership of the SPLC has, for years, been stacked with friends and allies of the disgraced founder Morris Dees. Dees, according to two letters by staffers, had been accused in “multiple reports of sexual harassment by Dees through the years [which] had been ignored or covered up, and sometimes resulted in retaliation against the women making the claims,” according to a March report published by The New Yorker.
Few details have emerged about what has gone on within the Montgomery-based nonprofit since the departure in recent weeks of Dees, President Richard Cohen and several others. The Daily Caller’s Wyatt Dobrovich-Fago took the opportunity of their visit to the nation’s capital to ask the embattled warriors of tolerance what they knew about their former colleague’s alleged lechery.

Former Vice President Joe Biden explicitly distanced himself from his party’s left flank Friday speaking to reporters in Washington, D.C.
Biden initially showed confusion between his own self-descriptions. When a reporter asked about him saying he’s the “most progressive” candidate, Biden said, “No, I said liberal. I didn’t say progressive.”
However, Biden had said just weeks ago he has the “most progressive record of anybody running.” He seemed to accept being corrected on that quote and went on to make a point about how his “liberal” record on gay marriage and other issues is no longer considered “progressive” enough because he’s not a socialist.
“I’m not sure when everybody else came out and said they’re for gay marriage. I’m not sure when everybody came out and talked about a lot of the things I’ve talked about, but my point is the definition of a progressive now seems to be changing. That is, are you a socialist? That’s a real progressive,” he said. This article was posted: Friday, April 5, 2019 at 6:46 pm Share this article"

Google has announced that they are eliminating their Artificial Intelligence Ethics Board, just a week after it was established.
Calls for an ethics board to oversee Google’s ever growing and developing artificial intelligence has been years in the making.
The ethics board, also known as Advanced Technology External Advisory Council (ATEAC) was founded on March 26, 2019, as an eight-member group charged with overseeing the “responsible development of AI” for Google.
But internal turmoil started from the get-go. One of the eight board members was CEO Dyan Gibbens of the drone company Trumbull Unmanned. Gibbens sparked immediate controversy over the use of Google’s AI being used for military applications – a topic that has caused divisions within the company for years.
And thousands of Google employees signed a petition to have another board member removed. Heritage Foundation President Kay Coles James was widely contested due to comments she made regarding trans people, as well as her organization’s stance on climate change.

Agreeing a soft deal doesn’t mean we’ll stop talking about Brexit,labourlist.org,Tom Kibasi,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://labourlist.org/2019/04/agreeing-a-soft-deal-doesnt-mean-well-stop-talking-about-brexit/,"6th April, 2019, 9:00 am Agreeing a soft deal doesn’t mean we’ll stop talking about Brexit Tom Kibasi Share this article: There is an emerging view on the left that if Jeremy Corbyn is able to strike a Brexit deal with Theresa May, the national conversation will refocus on domestic concerns such as the NHS, child poverty, and the housing crisis. As the architect of Labour’s Brexit plan — it was picked up by the party from a 2017 paper called ‘ the shared market ‘ that I wrote with my colleagues at IPPR — it is worth setting out why that probably won’t be the case.
The shared market plan has three foundational assumptions. First, that a close result was a mandate to continue our economic partnership on a new political basis, with a compromise on freedom of movement that would preserve but modify it. Second, that 46 years of economic integration could not be unwound in the space of two years, even if that was thought to be desirable (it isn’t). And third, that ordinary people’s livelihoods and living standards should not be sacrificed to delusions of grandeur about the future or misty-eyed nostalgia for the past.
As a result, the ‘shared market’ approach focused on how the new relationship should be structured. First, we proposed a customs union where a set of safeguards would be negotiated to ensure that the UK was not unfairly exposed in trade negotiations, including consultative mechanisms and volume of trade thresholds. Second, we argued that rather than being permanently locked into the single market without a role in decision-making, the UK should be outside the single market but aligned to it. This would be dynamic, constantly updated to avoid a gap opening up as regulation advances. The UK would retain the sovereign right to diverge if there was future regulation that it found intolerable — with clear and proportionate consequences for preferential trade arrangements — thus addressing a key concern of Leave supporters while not attempting ‘have your cake and eat it’. Third, enforcement and adjudication would be carried out by a new UK supervision authority and UK Court of Justice, which would include representatives from both the UK and the EU. The plan also proposes a compromise on free movement that would preserve but modify it, just as the EU has done with other third countries. This would involve better enforcement of existing rules and the adoption of the Swiss local-labour market preference system (agreed between the EU and Switzerland following a referendum in 2016). The latter means that in selected regions and sectors where there is high structural unemployment, residents are given priority in job applications over other EEA citizens. In the UK, this might mean that local residents would be given priority for manufacturing jobs in the North and Midlands where deindustrialisation in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in high structural unemployment to this day. The EU says this does not violate the principle of free movement. Sounds like a deal that works for everyone? When the plan was first published, it was positively reported by the Remain-backing Financial Times as well as the Leave-supporting Daily Express (‘Has this lefty think tank found a real solution for Britain?’, they asked). Our own view is that it represents the least-worst version of Brexit, but it is unquestionably inferior to membership. Retaining the right to diverge is no match for making the original decisions. It bakes in uncertainty as to whether the UK would diverge in future that makes this country a less attractive destination for investment. The rest of the world thinks our current deal — in the EU, out the Eurozone, and exempt from Schengen — is unbeatable. Neither should anyone be under any illusions that it would be easy to negotiate. Lining up the benefits and burdens, the rights and obligations would be incredibly complex. Sophisticated mechanisms will need to be created. At every stage, the EU will have a strategic imperative to ensure that the UK does not have a better arrangement outside the EU than in it. Given the Brexiteers’ belief that they can have their cake and eat it, it would face continuous accusations of being tantamount to ‘punishment’ and betrayal. The new arrangements would also require new institutions such as a UK Court of Justice and a UK supervision authority. As an international agreement, these would, of course, need to be multilateral with representatives from the UK, EU and neutral countries. The relationship with the European Court of Justice and the EFTA Court would need to be sorted out too. As a result, such new institutions would be heavily contested by Brexiteers who would claim that they were somehow membership of the EU by stealth or a ‘backdoor’ role for the European Court. All of this would require a busy legislative programme that goes beyond the withdrawal implementation bill. The ERG would fight it every step of the way. So Labour would need to decide whether it would support the legislative programme brought about by its own soft Brexit deal. Bizarrely, that might mean the locus of opposition to Brexit shifting from the opposition benches to the government’s own side. Moreover, given the enormous complexity of the negotiating task, there is no way that it could be concluded by the end of 2020, just 18 months after the government says it wants to leave the EU at the end of June 2019. So in autumn next year, parliament will need to decide whether to extend the transition (at the cost of around £1bn a month) or to enter the backstop (cue total meltdown on the government benches). It will be a mammoth political fight. That’s why it is delusional to think that the national conversation will ‘move on’ to the NHS, child poverty, or housing anytime soon. Quite aside from the fact that leaving the EU is bad for Britain, the key assumption of such a political strategy — do a deal with May, stop talking about Brexit — is hopelessly unrealistic. The next three to five years of British politics will be dominated by Brexit no matter what. Everyone needs to adjust to that reality and stop kidding themselves it will be otherwise. With a possible recession on the horizon, the battle over Brexit will only intensify — with Remainers saying it is a consequence of leaving the EU and Brexiteers claiming it is because of the nature of the deal. This may all be a moot point. It appears highly unlikely that a compromise agreement can be reached between the government and the opposition. Last night it emerged that the government was unwilling to make any changes to the political declaration, thus rendering the whole process a colossal waste of time. It looks more and more like a ruse to spread the blame around and to try to convince the EU that the government had a plan that would enable a further extension to the Article 50 negotiating period. The strategic intent of the government’s deal is economic divergence. The strategic intent of Labour’s plan is economic partnership. It is ludicrous to think that the fundamentals of these positions can ever be properly reconciled. Indeed, the government’s acceptance of a customs union through the backstop (ignore the name, in the absence of a known solution to the Irish border, it’s the default not an insurance policy) already illustrates what a dog’s breakfast the current deal is. A customs union must be joined with regulatory alignment to achieve frictionless trade. At that point, leaving the EU becomes largely pointless. So this only answer to ‘why are we doing this?’ will be because we had a vote in the summer of 2016. With Theresa May having already agreed to step down this summer, if a deal can be reached, the only leader defending it at the time of the next general election will be Jeremy Corbyn."

Book Review: AngloArabia: Why Gulf Wealth Matters to Britain by David Wearing,bright-green.org,,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://bright-green.org/2019/04/06/book-review-angloarabia-why-gulf-wealth-matters-to-britain-by-david-wearing/,"Image credit: US State Department
Following the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Kashoggi, and against the backdrop of the relentless war in Yemen, Britain’s relationship with the Gulf is once more in the spotlight. Amid global outrage at Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman for allegedly ordering the killing in October 2018, arms sales to Saudi Arabia were suspended in Germany, Norway and Denmark. Yet despite its public condemnation, the British government steadfastly refused calls to do the same, flying a high level delegation to Riyadh just weeks afterwards to discuss expanding ‘the horizons of political, security, military and commercial cooperation’.
The incident exposed the chasm between Britain’s professed liberal values and the distinctly illiberal consequences of its foreign policy decisions. The British state’s support for Gulf monarchies is no secret, with arms deals and trading relationships frequently called out by journalists and campaigners. Rarely, however, has this nexus of power faced such forensic examination in the manner attempted by David Wearing in his new book AngloArabia: Why Gulf Wealth Matters to Britain.
Why Gulf Wealth Matters to Britain Wearing sets himself a formidable task, to ‘map the deep, material structures’ of Britain’s relations with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a grouping of Arab monarchies comprising Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman. For the most part, he succeeds, detailing how the military, financial and political support Britain bestows upon the Gulf states has allowed for the survival of a deeply conservative regional order.
In exchange for lucrative contracts awarded to British corporations and Gulf petrodollars flowing to the City of London, the British government has provided political cover to repressive regimes, and delivered the military hardware required for the maintenance of autocratic power. Time and again, strategic, geopolitical and commercial considerations have trumped human rights concerns, and as Britain seeks to shore up post-Brexit influence in the world system, its relationships with the Gulf states look set to acquire renewed importance.
Power and empire A Teaching Fellow at Royal Holloway and member of Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT), Wearing lays out his case in painstaking detail, drawing on his intimate knowledge of the region’s history and political economy to reveal the webs of power binding the Gulf with the City of London. He traces the origins of this relationship to the colonial era, as the discovery of oil and gas paved the way for the entry of British corporations and created conditions for a new regime of accumulation that would shape present day political orientations.
The legacy of empire has laid the foundations for a system of ‘asymmetrical interdependence’; Wearing writes of how the balance of power remains skewed towards Western states, animated by the ‘dual logic’ of retaining energy security and geostrategic leverage. Oil and gas reserves have allowed the GCC a degree of autonomy as rentier states, who support themselves from rent collected through hydrocarbon sales to the outside world rather than taxes extracted from their citizens. However, while ownership and control of reserves has passed to Gulf states since the 1970s, governments have remained reliant on International Oil Companies (IOCs) for operations, shipment and sale. While Britain and the United States are not directly dependent on Gulf oil for their energy supply, the growing dependence of emerging Asian powers on Gulf oil has increased the impetus for retaining regional influence.
The Gulf and neoliberalism Welcomely, AngloArabia dispenses with the notions that UK-Gulf relations can be explained exclusively through the prism of energy security, and Wearing does not shy away from situating his narrative within a structural analysis of capitalist power. He points to the key role of Gulf wealth in the neoliberal era, with the influx of petrodollars since the 1970s driving the financialisation of the global economic system.
Yet the City of London’s rise as a leading financial centre corresponded with a decline of British manufacturing and growing balance of payments deficit, increasing reliance on the Gulf as a market for exports and source of inward investment. For their part, GCC states have sought the status and advantage of alliance with major capitalist states, revealing the political calculation behind economic transactions. Thus, Britain has resisted domestic pressure to suspend arms sales in order to protect the trade and investment relationships. Wearing’s arguments are buttressed with reference to extensive financial data, illustrating the sweep and scale of the British state’s economic entanglements with the GGC. A historical understanding of these economic cycles, he contends, is therefore essential to understanding contemporary world events, be that the realignment of trading blocs, the suppression of popular uprisings since 2011, or the climate crisis.
An important contribution AngloArabia serves its primary purpose well in documenting the disturbing connections between Gulf wealth and British foreign policy under hydrocarbon capitalism. Wearing brings theoretical heft and detail to a topic often characterised simplistically and poorly understood. Despite the reassurances that Britain is a force for good in the world, as this book reminds us, in practice it has been anything but the custodian of democratic values, willing to appease and in many cases actively strengthen repressive hereditary rule. The book complements valuable work undertaken by other scholars, such as Timothy Mitchell, Michael Watts, James Marriott and Mika Minio-Paluello, whose work similarly investigates how oil and gas underpins authoritarian regimes.
At times, the book’s prose comes across as a little flat and overly descriptive, missing the opportunity to construct a richer, more engaging narrative of how events unfolded. Nevertheless, it remains a well-researched and valuable resource for those seeking to understand contemporary forms of imperialism and capitalism operate in the world today, boldly interrogating the consolidation of autocratic power, and bolstering the case for a radical shift in UK foreign policy.

(photo credit: KOBI RICHTER/TPS)
Thousands of Palestinians demonstrated along the Gaza border fence with Israel Friday afternoon as a tense calm has been holding in the South.Local reports put the number of demonstrators as 10,000 Palestinians in five main spots along the fence with Israel. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health 84 people were injured in clashes with IDF troops who were responding to the violent protests with riot dispersal means. Five Palestinians were reported to be in critical condition after being was shot by troops east of Gaza City. The border protests began on March 30th and has seen over half a million people violently demonstrating along the security fence with Israel demanding an end to the 12-year long blockade, congregating at points along the border range between several thousand to 45,000 each day. The one year anniversary of the border riots last week saw some 40,000 Palestinians demonstrate along the border fence and saw three Palestinians killed by IDF fire.Last week Israel expanded the allowed fishing zone for Gazans to a range of between 22 km. to 28 km. after it was completely closed the week before as the result of a long-range rocket fired by Gazan terrorists, which destroyed a family home in central Israel, wounding eight civilians.The rocket attack sparked a round of violence between Israel and Hamas and led to Israel deploying three infantry brigades and an artillery unit to enhance the Southern Command, as well as canceling the leave of all combat units currently assigned to the command.The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) said that the expansion of the fishing zone is part of a policy to prevent humanitarian deterioration in the Gaza Strip and of a “policy that distinguishes between terrorism and the civilian population.”“The implementation of the move is conditional on the fishermen in Gaza honoring the agreements. It will not be possible to deviate from the ranges that were agreed upon, and any deviation will be handled accordingly,” COGAT said.Meanwhile, a Palestinian teenager was injured in the West Bank after he was hit by a car driven by an Israeli. According to Wafa news, 15 year-old Aysar Mahmoud Hushia was critically injured after he was run over near the village of Tuwanah, east of Yatta.He was evacuated to hospital for medical treatment.

Israel is poised this week to become the 4th country to land a craft on the moon when Beresheet touches down on April 11th. Beresheet, the Space IL spacecraft, is scheduled to land on the moon on April 11, one week after successfully completing its most critical maneuver on Thursday afternoon. During the complex moon-capture maneuver successfully carried out by SpaceIL's engineering team and IAI on Thursday night, Beresheet photographed spectacular images of the moon while the engines were running and at the peak of the moon's capture maneuver.The images provide a rare visibility of the lunar surface in perspective that can not be photographed from Earth. One picture shows the earth is hidden by the moon. The larger craters seen on surface are the oldest craters of more than 4.5 billion years old, the smaller craters are younger.In another picture the far side of the moon is visible while the Earth is in the background.The photographs were taken from a height of 470 km above the moon surface from the fourth peripheral camera of Beresheet.With the success of Lunar Capture, Israel has become the seventh country to enter the moon's orbit .During the coming week, intensive maneuvers and preparations for the landing will be conducted.The maneuver, termed Lunar Capture, was a significant moment in the module's journey to the moon, as it exited the earth gravitational pull and entered the moon's orbit. Although the maneuver looked like it successfully completed the mission, engineers from Space IL and the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) said that it will take several hours to definitively confirm Beresheet's new path.The spacecraft has now been captured by the moon's gravity and will begin circling it. Together, the moon and Beresheet will orbit the earth.Until today, the spacecraft has been traveling on the Earth's orbit, and at the beginning of this week reached the closest point to the planet, only 1,700 kilometers away, before continuing it's path to the landing point on he moon, about 400,000 km away.Watch the successful maneuver below.

One of the corollaries to the value of a public figure using social media to communicate directly with the public is that the public comprises a lot of sociopaths and general a**holes in addition to people who want to hear your message. President Trump found that out, and when he began blocking the trolls and dunkers, they took him to court. And they won :
President Donald Trump cannot block Twitter users for the political views they have expressed, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled on Wednesday.
Blocking users from viewing his Twitter account — a feature offered by the social media platform — is unconstitutional and a violation of the First Amendment, Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald wrote in her ruling.
“While we must recognize, and are sensitive to, the President’s personal First Amendment rights, he cannot exercise those rights in a way that infringes the corresponding First Amendment rights of those who have criticized him,” Buchwald wrote.
The government had argued that blocked individuals could still access the president’s tweets. The judge agreed but said that even considering the president’s First Amendment rights, preventing users from interacting directly with him on Twitter represented a violation of a “real, albeit narrow, slice of speech.”
The newest political social media figure, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, is discovering that she isn’t held as a semi-religious figure by most of the nation and she doesn’t like it. Her tweets have become more whiny, more sniveling, and more petulant as the number of people mocking and ridicule her grows each day. So yesterday, when it was revealed that she employed a fake black accent in speaking to largely black audience (see Sarah Lee’s AOC’s Demeaning Blaccent ), she couldn’t take it anymore, this is via bonchie’s AOC Responds To Criticism Of Her Fake Southern Black Accent And She’s Not Happy .

In short, Ocasio Cortez was caught and was trying to lie her way out of a difficult predicament that she’d lied herself into.

This, as we saw with Trump, is a violation of the Constitution. According to that federal judge, the right of the politician to communicate brings with it the right of everyone else to disagree. I’m willing to guess that the same people who were cheering on the lawsuit against President Trump will be strangely silent about this.
As the criticism of Ocasio Cortez mounts, we’re going to see more and more of this kind of behavior. It is pretty typical of the Marxist community organizer persona, the person who has started believing their own bullsh** and who can’t allow anyone to disagree with either what they are saying or who they pretend to be.

Paris police have fine-tuned their strategy of being more mobile and proactive to counter eventual violence since the first Saturday of protests Nov. 17. The Champs-Elysees avenue is off-limits to protesters after it was hit by rioting last month.
Hundreds gathered in Rouen, in Normandy, a past flashpoint, and hundreds more in eastern Paris at the Place de la Republique, the start of a march to the business district on the capital’s western edge.
The yellow vest movement, demanding social and economic justice, has attracted dwindling crowds but still remains a challenge to President Emmanuel Macron.

Tajani said the European Union was concerned over the recent developments in Libya that have seen General Khalifa Haftar and his forces advance on the capital of Tripoli, Il Giornale reports .
The renegade general ordered his Libyan National Army to take the city earlier this week, with troops loyal to the government saying they will resist the move and stop Haftar and his men.
Tajani called on all sides in the conflict to “stop and avoid any violent action,” adding: “There can be no military solution to the Libyan crisis. A new conflict would only cause further loss of life and enormous damage to the country and its population.”

— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 31, 2019
Tajani also warned that conflict could lead to the “risk of a new migration crisis, with the increase in [migration] flows, mainly to Italy and other Mediterranean countries.”
The EU Parliament chief advocated for the EU to “intervene immediately and speak with a single and authoritative voice, contributing to a peaceful and democratic solution, within the framework of the United Nations, as requested several times by the European Parliament.”
A new wave of migration from Libya would come just as the number of migrants attempting to get to Europe from its shores has greatly decreased due, in large part, to the anti-mass migration policies of Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini.
Data released earlier this year also revealed that the number of migrants drowining in the Mediterranean had also gone down due to Salvini’s Australia-style “stop the boats, stop the drownings” policy of refusing port access to migrant rescue NGO vessels.

Ronit Hasin-Hochman, CEO, Jerusalem Post Group Yaakov Katz, Editor-in-Chief UPGRADE YOUR JPOST EXPERIENCE FOR 5$ PER MONTH Show me later After asking right-wing supporters to vote for the Likud so “the Blue-and-White list will not win,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday gave a comprehensive interview to Channel 13. In it, he discusses the recovery of Zachary Baumel’s body, the current election campaign, national security, and several other issues. On Wednesday morning, the family of the late Zachary Baumel visited your office. As someone who knew his father, the heart aches that he did not know his son was returning to Israel. Can you tell who was the third country that helped? “It was a moving demonstration, and I also remember Yonah who would come and say that he does not forget his son, say he misses him, thinks about him, loves him. He lived for the return of his son. When I hugged the family I said I was sorry Yonah was not with us. For 37 years Israel attempted to retrieve him. And then Osna told me something amazing – years ago I told my mother, who’s almost 90 now – that it’s not enough that they want to but someone has to show up with the trump card and only that would bring him back. Amazing woman, she told me that I showed up with it. There was an extensive intelligence operation that included the Mossad, the Shin Bet, the entire intelligence community. It shows our tremendous commitment, after 40 years to extricate a person from an enemy state.” Have you heard the criticism on the timing? “Of course. There’s danger in that seeing as the polls are very close. But I’m afraid there’s a reversal of what I saw in 2015. Then I saw that the Left was complacent and the Right was eager to come to the polls and win. Now the Right is complacent and the Left eager.” How is the president related? “I say honestly that there is no guarantee that we can form a government. If the people want us to, then the Likud needs to win more mandates. A lot of Likud supporters say it’s in my pocket. I was in Bat Yam, I went to speak in front of young people. You should have seen it, people calling ‘Bibi, Bibi.’ I told them it’s not in our pockets. The polls say what people think, by the way, in our polls we are behind.” Are in-depth surveys so worrisome? “We are still two or three Knesset seats behind.” How do you explain that this election campaign is so difficult and traumatic? Records were broken, slaps, bouts, it was not clear who was against whom. Is Gantz insane in your eyes? “God forbid. You see what they say about me, my family, my wife, the Likud. The elections are characterized by one thing; Lapid and Gantz’s party have only one plan: Anyone but Bibi. Nobody cares about our achievements. I went to Washington and I brought American recognition of the Golan Heights. Brazil’s President Bolsonaro was here. I went to meet the Russian President Putin, who I keep in coordination with. They have no way of coping with our achievements, according to which Israel has become a superpower. In the past 10 years, we have become a global force to be reckoned with. They have nothing else to say, so they say ‘Anyone but Bibi.’ They call me a traitor. They talk about statehood, yet they do not see their own hump. They come with blood libel to realize their plan. I suggest they find something else. I am not complaining about them criticizing me, but they need to present what they plan for state. They are trying to evade doing that.” The hint of betrayal is terrible. But your campaign against them also hits below the belt. I’m asking you, what’s on Gantz’s phone? “That it is irrelevant. I do not know. The person who decided that was the Shin Bet chief, and I cannot complain to him. I think that when a candidate for prime minister says that I will send people to kill him, and that I am sending Russian spies to break into his phone, it indicates that he can not withstand the pressure. To be prime minister you need an integration of different skills in order to play in the international court. You need to be able to act within political reach, to understand economics. Lapid, who is meant to be prime minister for half a term, does not understand, Gantz went bankrupt. I understand economics. You need to understand combined security. If you do not understand, then you oppose the construction of the fence in the South that blocked the infiltrators. I went to Congress and opposed the whole world. It’s too big for them. All they are looking for is slander.” There is an agreement with Hamas. How do you see the issue of our peace with the Palestinians? “With Hamas it is impossible to have a real agreement. They wish to destroy us. There is nothing to agree on. What will we agree to, suicide? Therefore they have to be beaten from time to time. Since the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, not a single Israeli citizen was killed. In the past year, 300 Palestinians died on the fence [and] thousands wounded. They wanted to kidnap soldiers.” The “base” expected more. “I am not willing to pay the price of superfluous wars. I want every mother and father to know that I will not send their sons into an unnecessary war. And if it is necessary, then yes. I remember that when I was a soldier, I held my dying friend in my arms, Ben Hamo. He came from a transit camp in Beersheba, a gifted child. In the second vehicle there was Zohar Lenik of Yehud. My brother also died in war. I am ready to use force, but war is the last option. If deterrence can be achieved in other ways, yes. On the anniversary of the March of Return there were thousands of Hamas and Islamic Jihad members present to restrain the rioters.” How can you explain that? Do you see peace on the horizon? “You know what I said should be in the ‘deal of the century.’ I told Obama, Biden and Trump. I said that I will not stand for dividing Jerusalem.” You said you would not evacuate a single person. What do you know? “That will not be happening. If that’s the plan, there will be no plan.” Do you believe Trump will say yes? “There was no greater friend of Israel than him. He knows that when I insist on something, he must respect it. The same thing with Putin. I speak to him at eye level because we are sitting and we say get straight to the point. Peace will be achieved out of strength. As long as our neighbors or the Iranians have hope of destroying us, it won’t happen. My perception is completely opposite to Lapid and Gantz, who I think are wrong. The world is coming to us... China, Japan, India. The world is coming here, and the next thing is that the Arabs are coming here. Not everything is visible, but normalization is being established. They recognize that we are a superpower.” Do you expect Trump to recognize Judea and Samaria? “All the settlements, without exception, regardless of the blocs, must remain under Israeli sovereignty. Something amazing has happened now. They did not expect it. We talked a lot about this. I told him, ‘Donald, my friend....’ He is very smart. A prime minister should know how to say no when necessary. And I am full of energy to continue developing the economy. We will lower tax rates.” How many more terms do you want? “As much as the people want and I am able to serve. Go vote because we do not have it in our pockets. They turned my wife into a monster and expect me not to respond. We are a strong family. But what do you think? That we do not bleed? We get strength from the embrace and support of masses of civilians. I respect my son Yair for daring to respond to attacks against us.” Everyone talks about the submarines. Once and for all - what happened with the submarines? “For three years they have been talking about the cigars, and now they are raising a vicious blood libel against me. And you see two things that were given three minutes of spotlight in the media: Trump’s historic agreement; the recognition of Trump on the Golan Heights, and the comptroller’s report. The comptroller wrote a harsh report about the corruption in Benny Gantz’s company.” They recommended to file an indictment against you. Can you run the state and also appear in court? “It will not be remembered. The truth is stronger than the lie. Ever since I remember, I have been going through investigations, including in the past three years. And that has not stopped me from achieving what I have. I believe I will not be indicted, and I’ll be here for many more years to come. If Lapid and Gantz were to win the elections, we’re in danger. Lapid will face Iran? Sit down with Putin and Trump? That’s a joke. This is the real choice. They would take the country backward.”

Complicated Rules For Foraging Aren’t Helping Our National Parks -,reason.com,Baylen Linnekin,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/archives/2019/04/06/complicated-rules-for-foraging-arent-hel,"A hipster forages for oyster mushrooms in Minnesota. Steve Rice/MCT/Newscom Officials from the National Park Service (NPS) announced an agreement last week with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians that will allow select tribal members to forage for an edible plant called sochan in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP). The agreement allows up to three-dozen permitted tribal gatherers (plus up to five accompanying family members) to harvest sochan in the park.
The change, reports the Asheville Citizen-Times , ""returns the right by the Cherokee to pick and fry up the kale-like sochan, also known as green headed coneflower, on their ancestral land as they had done for thousands of years."" Officials also announced they're considering allowing park visitors to harvest ramps, a hipster-friendly species of wild onion .
This agreement is a groundbreaking move on the part of the NPS, but it doesn't go far enough.
The origins of U.S. anti-foraging laws, which I traced in a 2018 Fordham Urban Law Journal article, Food Law Gone Wild: The Law of Foraging , were borne out of white Americans' fears of and hatred for Native Americans, who I write ""were probably the earliest victims of anti-foraging laws in the New World.""
While foraging is enjoying a renaissance, so too are penalties for engaging in the practice. Foraging regulations in this country vary wildly, and tend to be far more restrictive than is reasonably necessary. For example, as I detailed in a 2015 column , a Maryland man was fined $50 and hauled into court for picking berries in a local park. I include several other examples of fined foragers in my 2016 book Biting the Hands that Feed Us: How Fewer, Smarter Laws Would Make Our Food System More Sustainable .
The NPS has slowly been evolving on the issue. In 2016, the agency modified rules for foraging in national parks, allowing individual Native American tribes ""to request to enter into agreements to conduct gathering activities."" In addition to a request, the new rules require both an environmental assessment and a formal finding that foraging will not significantly impact the relevant wild food in the park.
The agreement announced last week appears to be the first such agreement crafted under the modified rules.
It doesn't take a genius to recognize that the Cherokee aren't overly excited about the new agreement, which includes restrictions on harvesting methods, locations, uses, and other factors, all detailed here .
""For thousands of years, the Cherokee gathered sochan and other plants from these mountains,"" reads a statement from the tribe announcing the recent sochan agreement (emphasis mine). ""This agreement is a first step toward restoring those gathering rights.""
Elsewhere, the tribe notes that the process for getting the sochan agreement on the books required the tribe to pay the federal government $68,000 for an environmental assessment, one of merely nine steps in the process, which ""irk[ed] some leaders"" of the tribe.
Foraging opponents worry that allowing the practice will lead to overharvesting, but in sochan's case, the opposite is actually true. ""Cherokee methods of gathering sochan were found to boost seed production,"" the tribe notes . Put another way, prohibiting the tribe from harvesting sochan has harmed sochan seed production and, hence, is bad for the tribe and bad for sochan populations.
I also find it hard to get too excited by the agreement announced last week. It's a complicated, expensive, and time-consuming regulatory amendment that will just allow a few dozen people out of more than 300-million Americans to harvest the leaves of a sunflower cousin in a National Park.
I made the case for allowing foraging in all NPS units in a 2017 piece for the New Food Economy. In the column, I urged a shift ""from the default [foraging] ban that exists under the current rules—which mandate that all foraging in a given park is illegal unless a superintendent allows it—to something like much more permissive, akin to all foraging in a park is legal unless a superintendent prohibits it.""
Allowing foraging in a park isn't an all-or-nothing proposition. Park superintendents may—and do—allow foraging while also placing limits on the foods that visitors may harvest, methods of harvest, uses, quantity, and location, along with particular prohibitions for wild foods that have been overharvested (e.g., declaring that visitors may not harvest mushrooms in a park).
If overharvesting of any species is (or becomes) a problem in a given park, then the park superintendent is empowered to limit the quantity of that species visitors may gather in the park, restrict harvesting methods or locations, or by temporarily prohibit foraging for that species until it recovers.
With 46 of 61 National Parks already allowing some form of foraging of some things, it's a hop and a skip to having the default policy be that foraging of everything is allowed at all 61 parks, with park superintendents responsible for introducing temporary, species-specific restrictions when circumstances require it.
That way, more Americans, Native and non-native alike, would be encouraged to visit our National Parks and to learn about and enjoy the tremendous abundance and variety of wild foods that grow there, including sochan. After all, that's a central reason the parks exist in the first place.

On Wednesday, the Texas House of Representatives passed landmark school finance reform legislation . By a vote of 148-1, Chairman Dan Huberty’s (R-Kingwood) House Bill 3 passed the lower chamber, clearing the way for its consideration next by the Texas Senate.
The ATPE-supported school finance bill as finally passed by the House allocates billions in new money for public schools, reduces recapture, and provides homeowners with property tax relief. The House added bipartisan compromise language to HB 3 during Wednesday’s floor debate to ensure that all full-time public school district employees in non-administrator roles will also receive pay raises.
Read more about the bill and Wednesday’s major vote in this blog post from ATPE Governmental Relations Director Jennifer Mitchell. Stay tuned to Teach the Vote for updates as attention turns to the Senate to find out how the upper chamber will respond to the school finance bill.
The Senate Education Committee and both held multiple meetings this week education bills.
The Senate Education Committee’s meeting on Tuesday, April 2, 2019, largely focused on hearing bills pertaining to dual credit. The agenda for Thursday, April 4, included a host of bills relating to virtual schools, including some bills that ATPE opposes. Other pending bills previously were also voted out with favorable recommendations for the full Senate. Read more about the Senate committee’s activities this week in blog posts here and here from ATPE Lobbyist Mark Wiggins who covered the hearings.
On the other side of the Capitol, ’s Tuesday hearing covered topics ranging from pre-K to technology and educator preparation. The agenda for the committee’s Thursday hearing also featured a wide variety of issues, including one bill that ATPE opposes to require school districts to let participate in UIL activities. ATPE Lobbyist Andrea Chevalier covered hearings, and you can read her reports on the two meetings from this week in blog posts here and here .
ATPE is urging educators to oppose two Senate bills that would endanger free speech rights and limit the ability to teach students about content that relates to “a political philosophy” or “a matter of public interest.” The bills are Senate Bill 1569 by Sen. Pat Fallon (R-Prosper) and Senate Bill 904 by Sen. Bryan Hughes ( R-Mineola ), and both of them got a favorable nod from the Senate State Affairs committee this week.
SB 1569 and SB 905 would expand current laws that restrict the use of public resources for “political advertising.” The bills are unnecessary, since state law already prohibits using school resources for electioneering which is enforced by the Attorney General, and these two bills will have harmful unintended consequences.
SB 1569 would broaden the definition of political advertising, impose harsh restrictions on political speech by public school employees, and make it nearly impossible to teach students about elections or civic responsibility or anything deemed to fall under the vague category of “a matter of public interest.” SB 904 also tries to limit political speech by restricting access to government communication systems like a school district’s Wi-Fi network. It also calls for fining any third party that sends political advertising to a government email address. SB 904 will unreasonably penalize innocent third parties and have a chilling effect on free speech and political involvement by educators, even making it hard to teach students about anything related to politics.
Both SB 1569 and SB 904 appear to be reactions to the surge in educator participation in elections last year, and both bills are likely to spark constitutional challenges if passed. Based on their obvious targeting of the education community, both bills are reminiscent of unsuccessful efforts last legislative session to dissuade educators from joining professional associations that advocate for public education. With vote, these two bills have the potential to reach the full Senate for a floor debate very soon. ATPE is urging educators to contact their senators and ask them to reject SB 1569 and SB 904 . Read more about the bills in this blog post . ATPE members can click here to visit Advocacy Central and send a quick message to their senator.
As we have been reporting here on Teach the Vote , the legislature is considering ATPE-supported bills to increase contributions into the TRS pension fund . This week the House Committee on Pensions, Investments and Financial Services considered one of the bills, Senate Bill (SB) 12 by Sen. Joan Huffman (R-Houston), which the full Senate has already passed unanimously.
SB 12 is being sponsored on the Senate side by Rep. Greg Bonnen (R- League City), who chairs the Article III (education) subcommittee in House Appropriations and is the author of another bill to increase funding for TRS via House Bill (HB) 9. (That bill, which ATPE also supports, was already heard by the House Pensions committee last week.) ATPE Senior Lobbyist Monty Exter reports that during this week’s hearing on SB 12, Chairman Bonnen offered a committee substitute version of Senate Bill 12 that would replace its language with the language from his HB 9. After a brief hearing on the bill, the committee took the somewhat unusual step of immediately voting the committee substitute version of SB 12 favorably out of committee and recommending that it go to the full House for further consideration. The bill, which appears to be on an expedited track, will next go to the House Calendars Committee which has the authority to set the bill on a House calendar for a scheduled for debate. Once the bill has been approved by the full House, which it is expected to easily do, it will return to the Senate where Sen. Huffman will likely send SB 12 to a conference committee to work out differences between the House and Senate language.
While both versions of the bill would increase the overall contribution rate into the TRS pension system and provide current retirees with a 13th check, the House language does so by focusing the entire increase on the state’s contribution rate without raising the rates of educators or school districts. Additionally, the House version provides for a substantially larger 13th check, up to $2400 per retiree vs $500 dollars per retiree in the Senate version of the bill."

On Thursday, April 4, 2019, met to hear bills on several topics, including ’ participation in UIL, student health, protected speech, and the available school fund.
ATPE supported several of the bills on agenda: House Bill (HB) 348 (Nevárez, et al., D-Eagle Pass): Would allow school districts to provide increased compensation to a teacher who completes an autism training provided by a regional education service center. This bill was not actually yesterday due to a last-minute change. HB 1602 (Hernandez, D-Houston): States that a school district may not begin instruction before 8 am and calls for appropriating over $755 million to the Texas Education Agency (TEA) for the purpose of offsetting the additional transportation costs associated with the bill. Rep. Hernandez said that 34% of Texas schools start in the 7 am hour, and some students wait in the dark for the bus as early as 5:45 am. A student testified for the bill, saying it would help her get more sleep and receive less disciplinary action. ATPE member Yen Rabe also testified in support as one of several witnesses who cited increased safety and student well-being if the school day were to start later. HB 2738 (Meyer, R-Dallas): Would expand educator misconduct provisions adopted through SB 7 from the 2017 legislative session to also include non-certified employees, such as those who may work in charter schools and Districts of Innovation. The bill would require TEA to create a “do-not-hire” registry of these non-certified persons.
ATPE registered in opposition to HB 1324 by Rep. James Frank (R-Wichita Falls), which would require public schools participating in UIL activities to provide who meet certain eligibility requirements with the opportunity to participate in the activity. Districts would likely incur costs from this mandate, and HB 1324 does not ensure that would be subject to the same requirements and thus on a level playing field with their public school peers. Testimony on this bill was split between those who had concerns about implementation, costs to public schools, and increased government oversight, and those who wanted to be able to participate in UIL activities, especially sports. Read ATPE’s written testimony against the bill here .
The following bills were also yesterday: HB 873 (Allen, D-Houston): Would require the admission, review, and dismissal (ARD) committee to review students’ behavior intervention plans (BIPs) at least annually for those who have a BIP as part of their individualized education plan (IEP). This bill also requires changes to the student code of conduct, including parent notification about the student’s BIP or if the student needs a BIP when violations of the code occur, and it changes law around the use of restraints and time-outs, requiring detailed notification to parents. Lastly, the bill requires that if a school district takes disciplinary action against a student with disabilities that results in a change in placement, the district must conduct a behavioral assessment and develop or revise the student’s BIP. HB 1131 (Cole, et al., D-Austin): Would create the “Texas Public Finance Authority” to act as a “paying agent” under current law for the guarantee and payment of bonds. School districts could also borrow money from the new authority. HB 1906 (Burns, R-Cleburne): Would allow a parent of a student with severe cognitive disabilities to request that the child be exempted from required assessments. The ARD committee would make further determinations on whether the student should be exempted and what the best assessment instrument for the child would be. Special education advocates testified about concerns with making sure someone is still held accountable for growth and progress of these students, and argued that assessments should be fixed rather than removing students from taking assessments altogether. HB 2097 (Krause, et al., R-Fort Worth): This bill would allow only Arlington ISD to withdraw from TRS-ActiveCare under a pilot project. Representatives of the school district testified that healthcare costs for its employees under TRS are too high, but members of the committee were cautious and indicated there should be more study on statewide impact before allowing one district to have special treatment. HB 2244 (González, M., D-Clint): Would define what is protected speech and require school districts to adopt a policy establishing rules regarding students’ right to exercise freedom of the press at school. Testimony supporting the bill included remarks from students, teachers, a professor, and a lawyer. HB 2393 (Burrows, R-Lubbock): Would require the State Board of Education (SBOE) and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) to develop a hunter education course for students in grades 7-12 that a school district can use as a part of its physical education curriculum. Rep. Burrows stated that there are barriers to children being able to take hunter education and that many violations have been committed by hunters, presumably as a result of lack of education. HB 2555 (Parker, R-Flower Mound): Would update the guidelines on food allergies and require school boards and governing bodies of charters to update their policies on caring for students with food allergies who are at risk of anaphylaxis. HB 2689 (Dean, et al., R-Longview): Would require each school superintendent to designate a cybersecurity coordinator to serve as a liaison between the district and TEA. Rep. Dean stated that student data, such as social security numbers, are particularly valuable and in need of protection. HB 2739 (Meyer, et al., R-Dallas): Would require private school administrators to report misconduct by educators they employ to the State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC) and allow them to obtain information from SBEC any reports the board has about prior misconduct or criminal histories of such individuals. HB 2740 (Meyer, et al., R-Dallas): Would require the Department of Family and Protective Services to release information regarding child abuse and neglect investigations and allegations to private schools, as it does for public schools. HB 3683 (Dutton, D-Houston): Would allow the commissioner to authorize a charter or campus program to provide a dropout recovery program for grades 9-12, at which 50% of the enrollment must be students who are age 17 or older. Eligible students would include those who have dropped out or been in a disciplinary alternative education setting, as well as homeless students, working students, asylees and refugees, or at parent request. Charter school advocates testified that the bill would improve student retention and completion. HB 4205 (Craddick, R-Midland): Would allow repurposed campuses to be operated in partnership with certain nonprofits that have a successful record of operating a campus or charter. Former Speaker Craddick stated that a school slated for closure has only two options (close the campus or appoint a board of managers), and his bill offers a third option by allowing non-profit charters to partner with the school district to reopen the school. TEA General Counsel Von Byer said the campus would still have to be closed and repurposed, and that the repurposed campus would have to serve a majority of new students and offer a distinctly different academic program. HB 4613 (Shaheen, R-Plano): Would allow parents to request an exemption from state and federal testing requirements for special education students, potentially through a federal waiver. Special education advocates testified with concerns on meeting federal reporting requirements and having accountability for all students, including those with disabilities. HB 4611 (Huberty, R-Humble) and its related House Joint Resolution (HJR) 151 (Huberty, R-Humble): Would propose a constitutional amendment to allow the General Land Office’s (GLO) School Land Board to transfer up to $600 million to the available school fund. The current allowable contribution is only $300 million. Testimony from both the GLO and from Dr. Keven Ellis of the SBOE was neutral, focused on finding avenues to increase funds to the available school fund.
The following pending bills heard during prior meetings were voted favorably from committee on Thursday: HB 851, HB 1026, HB 1517, HB 1639, HB 1640, HB 1823, HB 2511, HB 2984, HB 3007, HB 3217, HB 3323, HB 3435, HB 3966, HCR 59, HB 843, HB 1160, HB 1276, HB 1632, HB 2030, HB 2184, HB 4310, and HB 2210.
The will meet again on Tuesday, April 9, 2019, bills, mostly pertaining to charter schools ."

Look at the ""conservative"" label from any point of view except modern movement conservatism, and you find multiple philosophical threads, with variations among them. Look at movement conservatism, and what you find is mostly folks who define politics by what folks oppose, not what they believe—and thus delivers a label that has little in common with more traditional conservatisms.
Movement conservatives oppose ""liberals,"" but that term remains so vague in their imaginations that it literally targets much of traditional conservatism as well—but variously, depending on which movement conservative is doing the labeling, and under what circumstances. At bottom, isn't the question really more about tribal loyalty—whether the candidate can be counted on to vote with the Rs?
And if that's true, why isn't there more push-back from commenters here, on how inappropriate is the premise of this thread, in the context of a supposedly non-partisan judiciary? Presumably the answer lies in recognizing the character of most of the commenters—who are, first and foremost, tribalists with little politics to claim other than opposition to Democrats, no matter what they advocate."

The other problem is the Courts, who think they are gods and rule by judicial fiat. We don’t vote for them and lifetime appointments are a huge problem, particularly since our elected representatives refuse to impeach and remove the criminal and the corrupt. They must be rendered harmless when it comes to their tendency to change the clear meaning of the Constitution.
They have tested our patience to the breaking point. They must be forced to do what we’ve elected them to do, and the courts must be restricted to the confines the Framers intended.

The problem we face is that the GOPe, save President Trump and the Freedom Caucus, are all in for Socialism as they practice Conservative Socialism or Fascism. The DNC represents the Welfare State and the GOPe represents the Corporatist State. As leftist idiots are vocal and surely only represent a quarter of the nation (and rising with our alien invasion), at least half the nation hates both the DNC and GOPe. Machiavelli wrote that while it is better to be feared (for enforcing Laws) than loved, the worst case scenario is when the people hate their government for its corruption and hold them in contempt.
I suggest that there will not be a Civil War with the South invading the Mid-Atlantic, or the Heartland invading the west Coast. What will happen is that the DC government will COLLAPSE. While we need our Amendment II to protect our families and property, it will not be against Federal Troops, but against the idiots who depended on DC from cradle to grave. When the $22T in Debt and rising, trillion dollar Deficits and $220T+ Unfunded Liabilities are insolvent, the DC Statists may print oodles of money from the Federal Reserve, but it won't buy one a cup of coffee.
As when the Roman Empire, French Empire and British Empire collapsed, the people stayed mostly in place and suffered it out until they formed independent countries. Then NY and CA will be faced with the dilemma of feeding their own, while the South and Heartland will have lots of beef, fish and wheat. It was the same in the Great Depression. Those on Margin who lost perhaps ten times their total investment jumped from NYC skyscrapers. Those who owned a farm or worked and lived prudently hardly suffered, and in fact many benefited as the massive deflation was a great boom for them. Granted the monetary system could collapse like Venezuela today, but those without debt and real money investments in gold and silver will probably do swimmingly well."

Let me add this to the discussion:
When the Colonists rebelled against their British government, there was little possibility that France, Spain or any other European country would attempt to grab a foothold in North America.
The thought may have been, let Britain drain their economy in a fight against these rebellious colonies and then we will take on Britain and/or the United States of America.
My concern today is that if there was a Second Revolutionary War, the Russians, Chinese, maybe NoKo or Iran would send in their disguised troops to fight for both sides and then claim the spoils.
How would we get our news?
Who would we trust?
In 1776, we were not spread thin as we are today. Many in urban areas would want to fight alongside Middle America.
How would we organize?
Who would lead us?
Would some in the Military support one side or the other?
How would local Police react?
How would we protect against the gangs that were in it for the ‘looting’ if the men and women in the fight were off in another battlefield?
What of the First Responders? Would they come to the rescue of those who couldn’t or wouldn’t join the fight? They would also have to fight off the ‘looters’ while trying to do their jobs.
What about supplies? How would food be delivered, by whom and to which side?
I don't know any of the people on this site. I do not know where they live. Heck, I don't even know if they are government agents looking to, spy on the people who post here. Maybe I am from the government to spy on you.
These are just a few of the questions that must be reckoned with and resolved.
I know where I stand and what I will do."
