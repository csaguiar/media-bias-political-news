Never mind the fact that Francis O'Rouke and Harris have both said they want existing wall torn down. That is the very definition of open borders. You're fooling nobody. The democrats want unrestricted access to the United States because that represents their base. They've generally lost white America, and they know it. The constant drumbeat for the last 10 years has been if you're white, you're a racist. It has worn on people."

First, stereotypical secretive border crossings are at an historical low. Second, we are experiencing a huge increase of people seeking asylum at our border, who want, and do, turn themselves in. Third, under our current law, each and every one is due a hearing with an immigraiton judge. We desperately need many more judges to meet the demand. Fourth, Trump does not seek to follow the laws as they are. Rather than appoint judges, he wants to avoid the law and simply keep all of the asylum seekers out. It does not seem to occur to him that the judges might turn alot of the asylum seekers away. The ""crisis"" results from the US failure to abide by its own laws, and instead propose walls and military options and closings of the border. No attempts have been made to get Congress to change our asylum laws. So, the people keep coming, and the number not yet given hearings keeps growing. My take is that Trump needs to drum up fear of ""the other"" in order to appeal to his base. Its an old (and sadly effective) tactic, practiced all over the world for centuries. Including in the US."

He separates children from their parents as a ""deterrent"" to what is, as of now, lawful behavior. He teases us with proposals to close the entire border.

As to responsibility for applying the law that's with the Executive branch which is constantly being sued for violating the law here and underfunding efforts except for Trump's wall. Trump traded desparate funding in order to issue an executive national emergency now held up in the courts. No one is intentionally letting illegal aliens in and as far as the loopholes, Trump lives in the loopholes himself so should know all about them. It's in Trump's hands getting a bill, make progress, but he likes the controversy and so do his followers.
