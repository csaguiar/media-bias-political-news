Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Is Wrong: There Is No Looming Climate Change 'Expiration Date' - Hit & Run :,reason.com,Kazinski,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/blog/2019/04/05/rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-is-wrong-th#comment_7748708,"The truth is the doubling of CO2 by the industrial revolution could very well have saved the planet from a massive extinction event. Plants have been sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere for about 2 billion years and that already caused one great die off when global O2 levels exploded from nothing to 20% of the atmosphere, so it's not unprecedented that plants can change the atmosphere drastically enough to affect all life on the planet.
CO2 reached dangerous lows going from 0.2% of the atmosphere 200 million years ago to 0.028%, that's an 86% reduction in CO2. Plant life needs a minimum of .018% of CO2 in the atmosphere for photosynthesis, so we were only 0.01% or 100ppm away from an environmental calamity. It certainly wouldn't be the first time some life form caused itself to die off because it consumed all of its available food supply, but if plant life goes, all of us go with them
Thank God, humanity discovered where the plants hid a lot of that carbon in coal and oil and converted it to life sustaining CO2 in order to keep the planet healthy and reduce our margin of error for CO2 starvation."

"Watch: Auburn Fans React To Final Four Game, Roll Toomer's Corner Before News Spreads Of Loss To Virginia",www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/watch-auburn-fans-react-final-four-game-roll-toomers-corner-news-spreads-loss-1388215,"On 4/6/19 at 10:11 PM EDT Share U.S.
An early celebration ended awkwardly in for some Auburn fans.
Gathered near Toomer's Corner in Auburn, Alabama, several dozen fans ran down the street cheering in the belief that the Tigers had advanced to play in Monday's national championship.
As is tradition for students and alumni of Auburn University, fans began to roll the trees located on Toomer's Corner, snapping photos and taking videos of the moment. But the fans didn't know that the Tigers went on to lose the Final Four game against Virginia 63-62.
The end of the game became instantly controversial as Cavaliers guard Kyle Guy was fouled on his 3-point attempt near the baseline with under a second to play. With Virginia trailing 62-60, Guy, an 81.8 percent shooter at the line, hit all three shots to put the Cavaliers up by one.
""It was a great draw-up by coach. We've ran it all year. I've gotten a lot of great shots from that corner. I had confidence in myself [at the line]. It's what we dream of,"" Guy told CBS Sports after the game.
Adding insult to injury for Auburn fans, Cavalier guard Ty Jerome was not whistled for a double-dribble during the last possession of the game for Virginia. Had Jerome been called for the misstep, Auburn would have taken over possession and been able to run out the clock.
Virginia, a team that bowed out in the first round of the 2018 NCAA Tournament to 16-seed Maryland-Baltimore County, advances to play the winner of the Michigan State-Texas Tech game on Monday.
According to Auburn's athletic website, rolling Toomer's Corner began in the late 1800s when Toomer's Drugs, a business located on the opposite side of the small plaza, ""had the only telegraph in the city. During away football games, when employees of the local drug store received news of a win, they would throw the ticker tape from the telegraph onto the power lines.""
The change to using toilet paper occurred in 1972 when Auburn halfback Terry Henley told reporters that Auburn would ""beat the No. 2 out of Alabama"" in that season's Iron Bowl. When Auburn defeated Alabama 17-16, fans began rolling the trees with toliet paper."
Martinique: Oprah Is Right About This Small Caribbean Island,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/martinique-oprah-is-right-about-this-small-caribbean-island,"IT’S STILL A BIG WORLD Oprah Is Right About This Small Caribbean Island Come to Martinique for the rum, stay for the ruins and the yole boat rides. Maybe leave speaking French? David Giral / Alamy
“Wait, there’s only one all-inclusive here?”
I had just arrived at the French Caribbean island of Martinique with very little idea of what to expect. As the daughter of a major cruise-loving family, who also happen to be Puerto Rican, I visited at least nine different islands over the course of my adolescence. But aside from everyone speaking French, its amazing rum and Oprah really liking it —I knew close to nothing about Martinique or the French Antilles.
I (falsely) assumed the things I’d see and do would be akin to the other islands I’ve been to—including mainly interacting with the turquoise water and endless mai-tais . So the news that the island only had one all-inclusive (Club Med) in the southernmost part of the island—on purpose—threw me for a loop. But my guide Géraldine Rome (who also happens to be the Martinique Tourism communications coordinator) told me that’s exactly how the island wants it.
“It’s a conscious decision,” she says as we ride together in the back of our tour van. “We want you to meet Martinique and it’s people. It’s another type of tourism.”
In other words, it’s OK to relax here. There’s plenty of places to do so and rum to consume. But there’s also opportunities to immerse yourself in the Martinique French and Creole culture—and it’s highly encouraged.
Just a few minutes later I started to see what Rome meant. Looking out the window on the way to our first destination, up the eastern coast from the from the capital of the island to the very northernmost tip, I observed no less than one out of every three people headed to work, school, or running errands with a baguette in tow—a remnant of the cultural influence of France, which colonized the island in 1654 . Tourists could be spotted here and there, but there seemed to be no other distinction between the life of those on the island and the visitors exploring among them.
We arrived at the village of St. Pierre, which sits in the shadow of the dormant volcano Mt. Pelée. I had been speechless only once before on my travels, after spotting the Colosseum in Italy for the first time. Seeing this majestic volcano standing proud and unbothered among the luscious rainforest in the northern part of this island marked the second time. But unlike the Colosseum, tourists don't overtake the area. We were actually the minority, making a stop at the ruined remains hidden among the town where locals casually went about their business—baguettes and all.
They didn’t seem bothered by this huge volcano in their backyard, but as someone who loved seeing Mt. Vesuvius and Pompeii, I was enthralled. Referred to as a “Little Pompei,” visitors have full access to the ruins from the devastating 1902 eruption , one of the worst in the world. Our second guide, André, showed us the spots where an entire theater and prison had been destroyed, telling the infamous tale of the lone prisoner who survived in one of the cells.
Hours later, and after a rum factory tour and the first of many incredible rum tastings at the northern Depaz Distillery, we made our way to a restaurant called Le Petibonum that is, like most places in Martinique, frequented by tourists and locals alike. Located in the coastal village of Le Carbet, which is conveniently located on the way back south from St. Pierre, the restaurant sits under a large wooden canopy for shade just a few steps away from the beach. A tiki bar was nearby, ready and able to make any drink of your choosing, including the local “Ti Punch” rum drink, that’s actually a shot of rum with a cup of sugar cane juice on the side.
When you’re ready to be seated, you get the unique pleasure of meeting the chef, Guy Ferdinand a.k.a. Mr. Hot Pants, who proudly sports a pair of very short jean shorts. He’s the kind of guy that would be an excellent guest cook on Guy Fieri’s Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives —he’s funny, a bit zany, and in love with his home island and food. And on top of all of that, he’s an incredible chef.
I don’t eat fish. But at Le Petibonum that changed. Fried cod fritters, a staple appetizer on the island, became my new-favorite food. And that’s coming from someone who peels the skin off of hot wings. The main dish was blue marlin served with a vegetable covered in cheese that somehow tasted better than a potato. I ate every last bite. But if for some reason you aren’t as much of an adventurous eater, don’t fret. I spotted the biggest, most delicious burger I’ve ever seen at the table diagonal to where I sat.
As Rome laughingly told me, “Martinique is all or nothing!”
Throughout the week my tour group and I continued the theme of culture and leisure, getting beach time on those amazing bathwater beaches, but also living like a local. What truly impressed me was the seemingly endless activities that we could do on this island that would take no more than 2 hours to travel across. In no particular order, here are just a few of the sites we visited: Rum distilleries The Le Jardin de Balata botanical garden Le Tombolo (a place in the sea where the water recedes enough to create a walkway from the shore to the neighboring island) The Habitation Clement and its Arts Foundation (which has a full-fledged sculpture garden) La Savane des Esclaves
I tried to joke to someone on my tour that Martinique was the island to make everyone happy—from your snorkeling-obsessed uncle to your art-loving cousin—but it really is true. The rum distilleries, with tasting stations, are the perfect combination of history and alcohol-tasting excursion. The botanical garden that sits, literally, in the middle of the rainforest will knock the socks off of nature lovers.
Le Tombolo, located in the village of Sainte-Marie, is the must-see spot for travelers on the hunt for those once-in-a-lifetime kind of experiences (and sights.). And the sculpture garden at Clement featured historical and political elements that will leave art lovers feeling accomplished on their vacation. I was personally drawn to the huge piece that spelled out “blood” in red letters, hinting at the island's colonization by white settlers in the 1700s.
There’s even La Savane des Esclaves , which is a beautiful outdoor, living museum dedicated to telling the history of the slaves that colonists brought to Martinique.
For those looking for a truly authentic adventure, I recommend choosing a “yole boat” tour as one of your water excursions. Yole boats are a traditional type of row boat only found in Martinique. Each person sits on the side of the boat as one person steers. To turn, each person must alternate between sitting on the edge of an oar. Every year locals hold races and we happened to go on the yole boat trip with one of the best competitors on the island.
Most importantly, to me anyway, was the food. It did not disappoint, especially if you’re a seafood lover. Seriously, Martinique people love their fish. If you come here, you will too—even if you’re not a seafood lover, there’s a 90-percent chance you will become one. In two days, I had tried 12 new kinds, from sword fish to cod to sea urchin, and they were all amazing.
In addition to Le Petibonum in the north, I was absolutely impressed with the food at Zanzibar, which is conveniently across the street from Le Tombolo in the south. You’d think with all the focus on amazing fish, that the island would someone lack in the dessert department, but that was not the case. I’m a huge sugar addict and finding sweets here was high on my priority list. The french toast dessert at Zanzibar made my foodie heart sing, and an incredible photo for my Instagram page .
Because I couldn’t take that home, I opted to bring back the go-to Martinique dessert called amour caché, which is a kind of pound cake that you can get with guava, coco, or creme underneath. Our yole boat captain shared some with us after we docked for a bit and I fell in love. I purchased a box from a local bakery in the island’s capital and more city-like area of Fort-de-France— then proudly stuffed it into my carry-on and safely brought it back to my kitchen in New York.
Now, I have to give credit to where credit is due. I visited that all-inclusive Club Med, and it seemed everything like it should be. Blue waters. Snorkeling. Lounging by the water as waiters bring endless food and drinks to you. There’s no shame in a relaxation game. But if you have the chance to escape, do it. Do it all, the way Martinique wants you to. Lots of fun, history, fish, yole boats, and a Chef Hot Pants await you. READ THIS LIST"

Fox News host Sean Hannity declared journalism dead during a Saturday appearance on the network's weekend show Watters' World .
Hannity appeared on the show as part of a segment with Watters' World host Jesse Watters where the two media personalities discussed the Mueller report, the ongoing criticism of Fox News by other media members and the state of the Democratic party.
The interview began with discussion about the Mueller report with Hannity saying that a cast of people assembled at Fox News has ""been right for over two years, unpeeling the layer of the onion, breaking stories: FISA abuse, FISA court fraud, rigging an investigation for a favored candidate; we've been proven right.""
Hannity added that people had to hate it when he and his ""ensemble team"" have been right, going on to talk about his hours of ""straight-news reporting"" after Watters pointed out criticisms that Hannity is an opinion host rather than a journalist.
Hannity added that he is ""sad for the country"" and doesn't want what happened with President Donald Trump and the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller to happen again.

""The lesson is simple, believe in due process,"" Hannity said, listing a domestic violence case against Michael Avenatti and allegations of rape against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as examples where he felt the news media rushed to judge and turned out to be incorrect.
Hannity later said that Democrats aren't interested in the issues but power and politics, citing a lack of ""I believers"" regarding accusations of rape and sexual assault against Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, a Democrat.
Watters asserted that Democrats are remaining quiet because Virginia is an important state and they don't want to lose it in upcoming elections before saying that the media ""doesn't hold them accountable — the Democrats — like they do Republicans. They're all on the same side and they'll let it slide.""
""Journalism is dead,"" Hannity replied. ""I said it in 2007.""
Earlier in the segment, Hannity cautioned Watters about gaining a voice as critics will want to silence him.
“They are gonna want to crush you, they want to silence every voice they don’t like and agree with,” Hannity told Watters. “Tucker [Carlson], Laura [Ingraham], me, we’ve all…Rush [Limbaugh], [Glenn] Beck, Mark [Levin], [Bill] O’Reilly you name it… Everybody gets, you get big enough, your voice becomes powerful they want to silence you. They want to destroy this channel.""
Watters later asked Hannity if left-wing media and other critics would give him ""the benefit of the doubt.""
Hannity said no, saying that Watters would be deemed ""guilty by accusation.""
Though Fox News continues to top the ratings for cable news regularly, journalism has seen a steady decline in the past decade. According to a Pew Research study , available jobs in the industry declined 23 percent between 2008 and 2017. For jobs in the newspaper sector, the decrease was 45 percent, with 71,000 workers employed in 2008 to compared to 39,000 in 2017.
According to the study, television newsrooms represent 33 percent of all journalism jobs in 2017 compared to 25 percent in 2008."
"Female Dolphins Appear to Have Sex for Pleasure and Orgasms Thanks to Their Well-developed Clitorises, Scientists Say",www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/female-dolphins-appear-have-sex-pleasure-and-orgasms-thanks-their-well-1386150,"On 4/6/19 at 11:20 AM EDT Share Tech & Science
Scientists believe female dolphins may have sex for pleasure and achieve orgasm thanks to their large and well-developed clitorises.
To find out more about the sexual behaviour of these creatures, researchers collected clitorises from 11 adult, subadult and calve dolphins who were found on beaches after dying of natural causes. The specimens were then examined using techniques including scans and dissections.
Dr. Dara Orbach, research associate at Mount Holyoke College, told Newsweek : “Dolphins have sex year-round, not only for reproduction but also to solidify social bonds and for social learning.
“Other species that have sex year-round, such as bonobos and humans, are known to experience pleasure. We wondered whether dolphins also experience pleasure. We address this question by looking at how the clitoris is built and how it compares with other animals known to experience orgasm.”
There were many similarities between the human and dolphin clitoris, according to the authors of the study. That included evidence of increased sensitivity in the clitoris, and the potential for it to engorge with blood, said Orbach. What’s more, the team did not expect the organ to be filled with a relatively large and abundant collections of nerves. These nerve bundles appeared to be much larger than in other mammals known to experience orgasm.

However, the team need to carry out behavioural and physiological tests to confirm whether female dolphins are able to achieve orgasm.
“This type of data is challenging to obtain in dolphins,” said Orbach. “For example, dolphins don’t have toes, so we can’t observe if they curl their toes during copulation.”
And she pointed out that testing samples from stranded dolphins does not make for the sort of refined analysis that would give the authors more details on the functions of the clitoris, she said.
“This study is only preliminary, but it is one of the few studies that has examined clitoris morphology is species other than model organisms in a laboratory. We know very little about female reproductive morphology in most wild vertebrate species,"" said Orbach.
The study, which Orbach co-authored with Dr. Patricia Brennan, was presented at the American Association of Anatomists annual meeting during the 2019 Experimental Biology meeting. It has therefore not yet been published in a peer reviewed journal.
The sexual experiences of animals, if they have them at all, are little understood, although evidence suggests that primates can experience orgasm.
As Marlene Zuk, a professor of ecology, evolution and behavior at the University of Minnesota pointed out in an interview with Popular Science : “We don't know much about orgasms in other species—in fact, scientists are still studying the significance/evolution of female orgasms in humans.”"

Source: ~Userc0373230_9/iStock/Getty Images Plus Stimulating Simulations: Evidence for God, Not Hackers
Peter Atterton, a professor of philosophy who teaches at San Diego State University, recently published an op-ed in The New York Times with the title, “ A God Problem .”
The author contends that the traditional “Western,” i.e. Christian , conception of God as a being who is at once “perfect,”“all-powerful,” and “all-knowing” is in fact “not coherent.”
To put this another way, the idea of God is self-contradictory, as logically impossible as square circles, colorless red things, and married bachelors.
Professor Atterton’s position, as I will show, is no less mistaken now than when it was articulated by philosophers in centuries past.
Atterton launches a two-prong attack against the concept of God. First, he tries to show the (alleged) logical incompatibility between God’s omnipotence (His infinite power) and God’s moral goodness. Satisfied that he has achieved his first objective, Atterton then attempts to demonstrate the inconsistency between God’s omniscience (His infinite knowledge) and His benevolence.
In what we can call his “argument from omnipotence,” Atterton refers to an old philosophical dilemma dating back to the middle ages. The dilemma is framed in terms of a question: View Cartoon
Can God create a stone that God cannot lift?
If we answer that God, being omnipotent, can certainly create such a stone, then we actually deny God’s omnipotence, for there would now exist something that God cannot budge. However, if we respond that God could not create a stone that is too heavy for Him to move then we equally deny God’s unlimited power.
Atterton notes that Thomas Aquinas, unquestionably the most prominent of all medieval philosophers and a heavy-hitter in the history of philosophy in his own right, escaped the horns of this dilemma by clarifying the meaning of omnipotence:
God’s power is indeed unlimited, but this only means that God can do whatever is logically possible .
The idea of a stone that is both immovable and movable is no idea at all, for it is a contradiction in terms, and a self-contradiction is a logical impossibility. The ontological equivalent of a logical impossibility is nothing.
It is self-evident that God can’t create nothing.
However, Atterton objects, God could have created a world devoid of evil. Presumably, a perfect being would have created such a world. That the actual world is ridden with pain and suffering, Atterton seems to imply, militates decisively against the idea of a perfect and omnipotent being.
This argument, it’s crucial to observe, is the perennial argument from what has become known as “the problem of evil.” From at least the time of St. Augustine—undoubtedly the most influential of all Christian philosophers and a thinker whose work continues to arrest the attention of contemporary academics, both Christian and non-Christian alike—Christian philosophers and theologians have accounted for the presence of evil by way of multiple “theodicies,” the most prominent of which is “the free will defense.”
Atterton addresses that version of the free will defense stated most recently by the contemporary philosopher of religion, Alvin Plantinga, in which the latter contends that it is impossible for God to grant human beings the ability to do moral good without at the same moment giving them the ability to commit acts of evil. Indeed, the very possibility of a moral act, whether virtuous or vicious, good or evil, presupposes free agency on the part of human actors.
So, in other words, a world in which human beings possess free will but are not free to misuse their wills and act wickedly is a world in which they are not free.
And this is a logical impossibility.
Interestingly, Atterton evidently believes that the free will defense is cogent as far as it goes. He just doesn’t think that it goes far enough, for while this most intuitively appealing of all theodicies may explain moral or human evil, it fails to explain what philosophers of religion call “ natural evil,” i.e. natural catastrophes that result in the suffering and destruction of innocent human and animal life.
There are two counter-objections to his objection that Professor Atterton fails to consider.
First, considering that he means to show the incoherence of the Christian conception of God, Atterton should look at how Christian thinkers have responded to the phenomenon of natural suffering. Within what is by no means a negligible current of the Christian tradition, natural evil is proof that the world is, as we’re informed by the book of Genesis, broken—mired in “original sin”—as a consequence of, yes, Adam and Eve’s abuse of their free will. Recommended Conservative Abroad: My Experience As A Trump Fan In Germany Michael Malarkey
If Atterton has problems with this doctrine of original sin—and legitimate questions have indeed been raised regarding it—then he should identify them. But the burden is on Atterton to state his case, something that he has not done.
Second, there are two other theodicies (both of which complement one another as well as complementing the free will defense) that have been devised to meet the argument from natural evil: the “greater goods” and “natural order” defenses.
The first refers to the goods of spiritual and moral maturity . According to this line of reasoning, God allows obstacles and hardships, i.e. natural suffering, so that by surmounting these trials and tribulations we may develop into the spiritually and morally mature beings that He wants for us to become.
No pain, no gain.
The second refers to the stability or order in the world. Exercises of free will would be impossible in a world that was utterly unpredictable from moment to moment. If, for example, God intervened every time something unpleasant was about to happen so as to prevent it from occurring, then the world would be radically discontinuous with itself. Planning would be unthinkable, let alone impractical.
No, free will can exist only within a world with stability and, hence, predictability.
Atterton’s argument from omnipotence has failed to show that the concept of God is incoherent.
In my next essay, I will show that his argument from God’s infinite knowledge—the argument from God’s omniscience—fares no better. "
The Left Wants More Government Because of Their Irresponsible Behavior,townhall.com,Bruce Bialosky,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://townhall.com/columnists/brucebialosky/2019/04/07/the-left-wants-more-government-because-of-their-irresponsible-behavior-n2544258,"The Left Wants More Government Because of Their Irresponsible Behavior Share The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com. Trending Socialist Gas
One might think this column is about the various childish people elected in the recent Congress by Democrats who have little life experience and less knowledge or wisdom. No, it is about how a major columnist at a prominent publication wants you to have more government invading your life because she herself is too irresponsible to review her own financial documents.
Let us review some thoughts before we go further. Regular readers know I draw no quarter on private enterprises acting badly. When you are a capitalist, you have an obligation to act in a manner that does not give license to socialists to argue for more government. They make up enough out of whole cloth to argue for more government; they don’t need ammunition handed to them by capitalists behaving badly.
That being said, you as an individual need to be aware of your own responsibilities to protect your own financial interests. Blaming others for not reading contracts or getting quality help to protect you does not absolve you of your obligations. Too often our government tries to tell people they do not have obligations.
A perfect example was the 2008 loan crisis. The overall discussion was about who had primary responsibility for the financial meltdown. Was it government setting stupid rules or was it free enterprise taking advantage? There was very little discussion of the individual taking out a loan they could not pay back or buying a condo to lease out with no financial reserves in case the tenant was lost. Look to yourself first before pointing fingers at others. View Cartoon
One would think that a member of our elite class would not suffer from these failings. Yet that is not the case. Michelle Goldberg is a regular columnist for The New York Times . She has a master’s degree from a first class university. She pontificates about many things and often rips into President Trump for whatever she perceives as his latest ill. She recently told us former Vice President Joe Biden was past his sell-by date. She is a serious Leftist voice with a growing platform.
Let me say, I have not met Ms. Goldberg. She may be a perfectly lovely individual. This is not about her personally. This is about the idea she writes about and supports.
Her column on January 5, 2019, gave great insight into the mind of those who harken for greater government control. She is a person who takes no responsibility for being errant. She seeks government wonks to save her from herself.
She spoke of the fact that her husband was reviewing her credit card statements to identify tax deductions. She says “I hadn’t noticed the hundreds of dollars of weird recurring bank charges that my husband discovered. It turns out I’d been signed up for a dubious program that purported to protect user’s credit in certain emergency situations.”
The bank (unnamed) was fined $700 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). After attempting to get redemption from the bank, she turned to the CFPB who arranged for a refund of $11,000 to her.
Then she torches the Republicans and Trump for trying to get a handle on this bureau. She does not mention that the bureau was set up with unique funding through fees from the Federal Reserve, being the only agency evading congressional oversight, or that it has delved into financial matters that are not part of its purview, but no one could stop them because they were not subject to congressional oversight.
The only thing that is important is that Senator Elizabeth Warren, creator of the CFPB, is a brilliant policy innovator because Michelle Goldberg (a highly educated individual) is a financially irresponsible person.
She was irresponsible on two levels. First, who doesn’t review their bills for charges -- whether it is your phone bill, power bill or credit card bill? That is, unless you just hate money. Any time you get a bill you should review it in detail. This is one of the reasons I do not like having the aforementioned bills charged directly to my credit card. Suddenly there is a change and I have already paid it and must get the money back from a corporate behemoth.
I don’t think of errant charges as a one-time thing. I think of them in annual chunks. To me, a monthly charge of $10 is $120 annually; thus, let’s get it off my bill. Recommended Conservative Abroad: My Experience As A Trump Fan In Germany Michael Malarkey
But Ms. Goldberg was too irresponsible to review her bills and take personal responsibility. And she was too irresponsible to take step two.
As my clients have heard me tell them repeatedly, being successful in business is realizing your own limitations and compensating for them. If you are not good at handling your accounting (and almost no business person should), hire someone to do it and focus on your main skill – medicine, architecture, real estate, etc.
Ms. Goldberg could have realized her own limitations and compensated for her inability to properly review her bills. She could have had her husband review them from the beginning and he would have seen the errant charges and had them terminated early on, thus avoiding all her money being taken from her and needing it to be refunded.
A child could have acted in a more responsible manner than Michelle Goldberg did in her own life. Then because of her own bad behavior she thought that her salvation is a government bureaucrat and praised them for getting something done correctly for once. That is not mature action.
Her bank was apparently atrocious for improperly charging her credit card for a credit security program she states she did not order. But if Goldberg was a responsible adult about her own finances then this episode would have never happened and the government employee could have gotten a real job.
The pivotal theme here is Goldberg believes that centralized control by an “elite” group will benefit the whole. Of course, in this socialistic dream the power shifts to a new group and she is part of that group. And you end up with less say in your own life affairs. This is just another sad example of Leftist values run amok. "

Stella …..,indepthnh.org,Nancy West,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://indepthnh.org/2019/04/06/stella/,"Subscribe to Feature Still from a Streetcar Named Desire Stanley Kowalski goes through Blanche DuBois' trunk in a Streetcar Named Desire. Vivian Leigh played Blanche and Marlon Brando played Stanley.
By SUSAN DROMEY HEETER, Joyful Musings
Today I muse joyfully on a A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams. If you’ve never watched the play, seen the movie, read the script, well, friends, it’s time.
Earlier this week I attended a workshop about writing. During one of the breaks I meandered around the building and found what I consider to be the greatest of all treasures: free books. At the Rochester Recreation Center here in New Hampshire there are a plethora of free books – selections for children, adults, teens, books on spirituality, plumbing, poetry. And when I spotted A Streetcar Named Desire , I picked it up and have been reading it ever since.
Stanley Kowalski. Stanley. The copy I picked up has an introduction written by Arthur Miller. He writes of the performance with Marlon Brando who played Stanley on both stage and screen. “Nobody had seen anything like him before because that kind of freedom on the stage had not existed before…Brando was a brute but he bore the truth.” Susan Dromey Heeter
Brute. That’s the perfect word to describe Stanley. He’s so vile, so cruel. To read his lines, his “Stell-la !” is to be up close and personal with such brilliant writing, a creation of a persona so dark is, well, the epitome of stellar, STELL-A , writing.
When I ask my high school students what they are reading in their classes, I am entirely jealous they spend time with such glorious reads – To Kill a Mockingbird , Night , The Heart is a Lonely Hunte r. I forget how glorious it is to spend time decoding lines, learning about authors, spending time with such great writing. A Streetcar Named Desire reminds me of that, Tennessee Williams’ brilliance – I’d forgotten.
And in this era of tweets and posts and blips of writing, I was reminded last week of how glorious it is when I am reminded of the depth of a beautiful, beautiful scribe. I’d forgotten. Kind of like when I go to Manhattan and get a roast beef sandwich from Sarge’s Deli I am immediately returned to “Oh, THIS is what really good roast beef tastes like – that stuff from Market Basket really does not cut it.”
Today I muse joyfully on Tennessee Williams, on Stanley Kowalski, on Stella, on Blanche, on a play Arthur Miller writes, “In a word, this play made it seem possible for the stage to express any and all things and do so beautifully.”
What a lovely reminder to go back to quality, to forgo the tweets and posts. I muse joyfully that you may enjoy that pleasure today in a bin of free books and if you spot A Streetcar Named Desire – do scoop it up.

Victor Caratini had a night, as did Jason Heyward and Chicago Cubs starter Cole Hamels . The Cubs bested the Milwaukee Brewers 14-8 in what felt like the first win in, oh, 87 years (I'm a big fan of hyperbole here, people).
Daniel Descalso led off against Brewers starter Corbin Burnes with a ground out to second, followed by a ground out from Kris Bryant and a fly out from Anthony Rizzo .
The Brewers responded with a lead off home run from Lorenzo Cain , the sixth Brewers homer of the series, to put them ahead 1-0 .
Heyward bashed a two run homer in the second inning, scoring Kyle Schwarber , who had gotten on base with a long single to right. The Cubs now led 2-1 .
The Brewers tied it in their half of the second with a sacrifice fly from Lorenzo Cain , scoring Yasmani Grandal . Grandal had gotten on base with a double. The Brewers were not able to take the lead, ending the inning at 2-2 after a strikeout from Christian Yelich .
Hamels had his first 1-2-3 inning in the third, with a strikeout from Ryan Braun , a line out to short from Jesús Aguilar , and a fly out to center from Travis Shaw .
The Cubs added two more runs in the fifth inning, thanks to a home run to right from Caratini after Heyward got on base with an error on shortstop Arcia. The Brewers went 1-2-3 in the bottom half and the inning ended with the Cubs ahead 4-2 .
Another home run came in the sixth from Javier Báez , snapping a 0-for-6 streak with five strikeouts. Kyle Schwarber followed with a walk and advanced to second on a wild pitch. He would come around to score on a base hit from Albert Almora Jr , putting the Cubs ahead 6-2 . Junior Guerra replaced Burnes after the Almora single and was able to get out of the inning without any further damage.
Kyle Ryan entered the game in relief of Hamels in the seventh. Hamels went six innings with two runs (both earned), five strikeouts, one home run, and no walks. Ryan gave up a single to Arcia, struck out Ben Gamel looking, got a ground out from Cain, and walked Yelich. Allen Webster then took over for Ryan and gave up a three run home run to Braun, inching the Brewers closer at 7-5 . The inning ended with a line out to center from Aguilar.
Heyward hit his second home run of the night (and third of the series) in the eighth off of new Brewers pitcher Alex Wilson . Caratini remained hot with another single. Ben Zobrist , who had entered the game the inning prior and replaced Schwarber in left field, also singled. Descalso walked, and Rizzo brought in two runs with a double, bringing the score to 10-5 . Wilson faced his last batter of the night with a walk to Báez.
The Brewers did a double switch in the bottom of the eighth, with Taylor Williams entering to pitch and Eric Thames in at first in place of Aguilar. Williams's first batter was pinch hitter David Bote , who wasted no time with a three RBI double. Heyward walked, and Caratini singled again for an RBI, and the Cubs would leave the top of the inning ahead 14-5 .
Randy Rosario took over pitching for the bottom of the eighth and Bote remained in at third base, replacing Bryant. Rosario got Shaw to ground out to first, but followed with back-to-back walks to Hernán Pérez and Grandal. Thames hit a three run home run and the Brewers left the inning now trailing 14-8 .
Steve Cishek pitched a 1-2-3 bottom of the ninth to secure the Cubs first since Opening Day. He faced Braun in the bottom of the ninth and got him with a tapper back to the mound, which he flipped to Rizzo for the out. Mike Moustakas pinch hit for Williams and flew out to left. The final out was recorded ground out to third from Shaw.
This win was such a relief for me, and I'm sure I am not alone in that feeling. Watching Heyward bring the power was a delight, as was the production from Caratini. It felt like the Cubs team we know and love; hopefully they'll stick around for a while."

In 1950, India became a republic headed by Jawaharlal Nehru, a silver-tongued orator, one with a fine command of the English language and part of the Cambridge mold. The constitution was written by B.R. Ambedkar, a man who preferred a suit to traditional Indian garb and had his intellect trimmed at Columbia University in the United States. Unquestionably, India’s founding members and their Western cultural influences have significantly helped to shape its identity.However, an independent republic did not actually mean social cohesion nor freedom for all. India was still grappling with princely states and there were fresh wounds, like that of the partition. In order to mend fences within the nation and abroad, India’s first prime minister, Nehru, took on a socio-capitalist model wherein a large number of industries were state-owned and operated with little room for private sector participation. Politically, Nehru’s approach was of a pacifist, keen on not having bad blood between neighbors, at least not any more than that which had already prevailed. This model of governance for more than 70 years with the Indian National Congress Party had left the electorate aching for a change from both the policy and the Nehruvian dynasty. Systemic corruption, bureaucracy, nepotism and most importantly, India’s identity being limited to a former colony of the British Empire exacerbated the pains of the common man. “Bharat” under Modiand changing relationshipsMore than 70 years into independence, India under current Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership seems to be establishing its countenance. A humble man who has his chai piping hot and his food meatless seems to have resonated with a billion-plus population. His persona is a breath of fresh air for a populace that is used to its leaders orating in English and taking pride in their Western cultural influences. This has aided Modi’s ambitions of reviving India’s historical roots and connections to those countries with whom India has a shared history and culture. Samuel P. Huntington, in his book Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, put forth the argument that the world of the future would face a clash along civilizational lines, and growing democracies like India would look to align themselves with the West.Modi has picked up Huntington’s playbook in part, while also diverging from it by proselytizing the Eastern dictum of “Modernizing without Westernizing.” Since independence, India chose allies and foes based on the electorate’s sentiment and even took a stance of nonalignment during the Cold War, matching its socio-capitalist economic model, i.e. capitalism from the United States and socialism from the former Soviet Union. In order to appease the Muslim voting bloc, the Indian National Congress pursued a nonaligned strategy even with the Israel-Palestine conflict.With elections looming in April 2019, Modi’s term in office has changed India’s conventional alliances. India’s foreign policy shed its non-alignment when its prime minister visited Jerusalem in 2017, skipping Ramallah. The protocol for previous state level visits was to travel to both the capitals of Israel and Palestine. This is a clear sign of changing geopolitical priorities.Modi, with probably the most stamps on his passport of any Indian prime minister, has pursued civilizational outreach as a way to foster friendships. Modi’s “Act East” policy of forging stronger ties with ASEAN countries and his welcoming reception to foreign leaders in his home state of Gujarat, combined with his trip to Israel, is evidence that India has come of age and intends to play a larger role in the world. It plans to pursue this agenda through a Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist civilizational triangle, i.e. forging deeper ties through religion, culture and shared values.Modi’s visits to Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka, Japan and Russia between 2014 and 2017, and the International Solar Alliance are further symbolic of this intent. Modi’s embrace of yoga, bringing it to four corners of the world with Yoga Day and branding it as a symbol of India, has enhanced the country’s identity from being narrowly viewed to the land of the Taj Mahal – built by a 17th century Mughal ruler – to a broader, more contemporary and outward-looking nation. Can nationalism andmultilateralism work together?Modi’s initiatives are nationalistic, though nationalism in the case of India, a former colony, is one of decolonizing the Indian mindset and taking pride in its rich heritage. One such effort was the statue of one of India’s pioneers – Vallabhai Patel. In October 2018, the “Statue of Unity” was unveiled by Modi to celebrate India’s first deputy prime minister, Sardar Vallabhai Patel, and his contribution to the nation’s unity. It is worth noting that even though Patel was a member of the Indian National Congress, his views made him more of a realist than the pacifist prime minister to whom he was reporting. His skepticism toward China and his regrets over the lack of support from India’s side to the Tibetan cause made him one of India’s early realist thinkers. While Modi’s initiatives are nationalistic, his commitment to international treaties and multilateralism has not wavered. A signatory to the Paris climate agreement and other multilateral accords, Modi’s India has spoken highly of international courts of justice and has voiced its support for the judgments on the South China Sea dispute. Even its apprehension in committing to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) at the 2018 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit can be attributed to its strong stance on Chinese trade practices and not an aversion to free trade. The primary fear for Indian industry has been China’s enhanced market access to India, resulting in a ballooning trade deficit with the communist nation. India’s “Act East” policy has gained momentum and with Modi’s actions, the cloud has cleared around India’s strategic and civilizational allies. Modi has engaged partners around the globe while driving a hard line for Indian interests, ensuring it has a prominent voice on the global stage.The question will be whether the Judeo-Christian West will ally with the Judeo-Hindu-Buddhist civilization of the East that Modi seeks to build, under shared values of democracy and sovereignty. Modi’s commitment to broadening India’s identity through his party’s nationalistic fervor has not limited his foreign policy objectives. The commitment to multilateralism abroad and nationalism at home do not need to be mutually exclusive. Modi’s India is a case in point. The writer is a foreign policy analyst based out of New York.

The virulently anti-Israel movement known as Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions – BDS – is roiling through campuses, overflowing into city councils, encroaching into corporate boardrooms, and now chomping at the essence of Israel’s special niche in the world: its travel and tourism industry. Everywhere, the boycotters have been asking to isolate Israel. BDS even convinced Airbnb to stop listing Jewish locations in Judea and Samaria– also known as the West Bank (a term invented after Jordan invaded in 1948, when the UN’s partition suggestion failed to create two states). In Ireland, a bill advancing through Parliament may criminalize visiting the Old City and even purchasing lunch or a keepsake.Whereas similar boycotts against other countries have inflicted withering effects on national economies, in Israel – it simply hasn’t worked. The opposite is true. Yes, boycotters are busy demonizing Israel. Yet despite this, Israel’s tourism industry has rocketed to a singular triumph and now employs tens of thousands. Flights are packed and new non-stops are being added across the globe. Even though new luxury hotels are going up as fast as the Mideast sun will dry concrete, rooms remain in high demand and, thus, are scarce and expensive. Israel has become world famous for creative cuisine and trendy eateries; so if you want to get a table at the most popular restaurants, you’ll need to book weeks in advance. Travel and tourism to Israel has dramatically changed. It’s not just synagogue sisterhoods and Jewish organizations. Swelling up from Israel’s “Start-up Nation,” world famous top chef culture, and hard-won penetration of markets beyond America and West Europe, as well as its sophisticated travel industry burnishing, Israel is now a destination for the entire world. Traditional Jewish-American travelers from Miami to Seattle must now compete with Silicon Valley techies, Chinese students, Indian tourists, East European Christian pilgrims and diverse businessmen from across the planet. The numbers are multiplying.IN 2016, 2.9 million total worldwide visitors visited Israel. By the close of 2018, that number had boomed to 4.1 million—and the totals keep climbing. Within the coming decade, Israel expects to employ 98,000 people in its tourism sector.When Israeli tourism prospers, so does the Palestinian community. Christian pilgrims make a beeline for Bethlehem. Thus, tourism breeds economic interdependence and strengthens co-existence.Arrivals stream in from everywhere.Today, most North American travelers to Israel are not Jewish; they are Christian, often seeking Biblical discovery. From North America, Jews comprise about 40% to 45% of the travelers, while Christians generally hover at about 60% year to year, according to official estimates. While the Jewish-Christian percentages remain the same, the growth spurt for North America has seen the overall numbers increase by 42% since 2016.In 2009, only 20,000 Indians visited Israel, reports Israel’s tourism office in New Delhi. Some years ago, Israel hosted Indian travel agents, knowing that in India, such agents book most of the travel. Reciprocal travel programs tapped such markets as India’s Kerala Christians. Dramatically improved diplomatic relations between New Delhi and Jerusalem combined with thrice-weekly direct Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner service – which was granted special Saudi flyover permission, saving more than two hours – has created a steady flow of Indian visitors. This year, Israel expects more than 80,000 Indian arrivals, with travel officials working to achieve a further 65% increase. That may happen if, as planned, the Israeli film industry entices Bollywood producers to use Israeli locations.In 2015, only 30,000 tourists visited Israel from China. But when direct flights between Ben Gurion airport and numerous Chinese cities were added, the number more than trebled to 100,000-plus annually. Today, China is Israel’s greatest growth market. Celebrity Chinese chefs are now flown in, and Chinese-speaking guides are easily found. AIR CONNECTIONS are the lifeblood of Israel’s tourism as well as its international viability. Nowadays you can fly nonstop to Israel from numerous North American cities. From New York’s JFK, Delta is launching a twice-daily nonstop. From Newark’s Liberty, United also flies nonstop twice daily. From Washington, DC’s Dulles, United will soon inaugurate thrice-weekly nonstop service. From Toronto, Air Canada offers daily nonstops. From Montreal, Air Canada will fly twice weekly during the summer. From San Francisco, United flies daily, primarily for the surging nexus to Silicon Valley.North American carriers all compete with El Al, which is by far the dominant carrier linking the continent with Israel, boasting 45 nonstop flights weekly that carry more than 50,000 passengers per month. For many Israel-bound travelers, El Al is the one and only carrier – and it has vastly improved. With the exception of the Jewish sabbath and holidays, Israel’s star-emblazoned national carrier flies day or night, rain or shine, good news or bad news, rockets or not. Its unique extra security, where young security staffers at the airport ask invasive personal questions to evaluate risk, are sometimes viewed as a mix between reassurance, ritual, and a Jewish guilt trip. “You’re coming to Israel? Why now?” Or the classic: “Who do you know in Israel?” Answer: “Everyone.”El Al has conquered labor problems, onboard religious tiffs and more to expand and enhance its daily service to and from multiple US cities. Not only can you fly El Al nonstop direct from New York, Newark, and Miami, but now also from Boston, Los Angeles, Toronto, and this summer, from Las Vegas and San Francisco. In spring 2020, Chicago service starts. Most of all, El Al predominantly offers Dreamliner service. On its 747 and 777 fleet, El Al still offers Economy Seat PLUS, relatively affordable, spacious, and comfortable, especially in the bulkhead row. For many traveling to Israel, El Al’s Economy Seat PLUS is now the go-to booking. What’s more, you can purchase business class check-in at either JFK or Newark for $35 to $45 and your travel experience will be delightful. The lounge is restful and stocked with good food and beverages, allowing you await departure in luxury.Israel’s tourism triumph would not have been possible without an airline triumph as well. That triumph in the skies has finally happened. The writer is the author of IBM and the Holocaust and a syndicated columnist who travels extensively, frequently reviewing the hotels he stays in.

"Iranian revolution, phase two: Hidden in plain sight",www.jpost.com,LEILA GILBERT,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Iranian-revolution-phase-two-Hidden-in-plain-sight-585966,"Opinion Iranian revolution, phase two: Hidden in plain sight Those who oppose the US sanctions on principle may be unaware of the severity of the regime’s misdeeds, since much of the Islamic Republic’s malicious activity is concealed. April 8, 2019 09:40 b Iranians burn a U.S. flag during a protest against President Donald Trump's decision to walk out of a 2015 nuclear deal, in Tehran, Iran, May 11, 2018. . (photo credit: REUTERS) The Islamic Republic of Iran never seems to entirely disappear from international news. Some of this is due to the uproar over US President Donald Trump’s rejection of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and his administration’s efforts to quell Iranian misbehavior through economic sanctions. Those who oppose the US sanctions on principle may be unaware of the severity of the regime’s misdeeds, since much of the Islamic Republic’s malicious activity is concealed. For instance, last year Israeli agents exposed an Iranian warehouse overflowing with undeniable evidence of deadly intentions. They somehow managed to seize and export thousands of notes, reports and graphs, documenting comprehensive development of nuclear weaponry. It had all been carefully hidden – until it wasn’t. Meanwhile, Iran’s bloody fingerprints continue to appear in various conflicts in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and beyond. And its tireless attempts to assault Israel continue, primarily acted out through proxies like Hamas and Islamic Jihad – not to mention Hezbollah, whose secret tunnels between Lebanon and Israel were recently exposed and destroyed. Just days ago, Israeli news sources reported a statement by a high-level Hamas authority that Iran had covertly ordered the recent rocket attack that demolished a house north of Tel Aviv, injuring seven people including two infants. On the other hand, there’s little to hide when Iran boasts of new weaponry, flashy military exercises or battlefield triumphs. In fact, notorious Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani has proudly proclaimed Iran’s intentions, “We are witnessing the export of the Islamic Revolution throughout the region. From Bahrain and Iraq to Syria, Yemen and North Africa.” Indeed, during February’s celebrations of the Islamic Republic’s 40th anniversary, Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, declared that the Islamic Revolution had entered its “Second Phase”: a time “of self-development, society-processing and civilization-building of the Islamic Revolution.” This second phase was affirmed by a Qom University spokesman as “the cornerstone of major policy makings in the country.” In other words, the worst may be yet to come. Take, for example, Iraq, where Iran’s strategy is one of creeping hegemony. So far it is working well through such tactics as political intimidation, shady financial transactions and armed intrusion. Iran-backed militias, under the command of the Quds Force, are tormenting minority returnees to their homes – Christian and Yazidi genocide victims. A campaign of intimidation, threats at gunpoint, and cruelty at checkpoints continues unabated. Some who’ve tried to return and resettle in their towns and villages have fled yet again, too traumatized to remain. Fear and stealth are also wielded like weapons inside Iran itself. Sudden arrests, fierce interrogations and mass executions of political and religious “enemies of the state” are mostly concealed from the world’s eyes. Baha’is are the largest religious minority in Iran, described by the regime as a “deviant sect,” whose members are “de facto apostates.” According to the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, Baha’is are “the most severely persecuted religious minority in Iran, not recognized by the state, and denied their political, economic, cultural, and religious rights.” It is noteworthy that the Baha’i World Centre is located in Haifa. Meanwhile, in 2018 Iran was ranked the 9th worst persecutor of Christians in the world. In late 2018, in one week alone, 114 Christians were arrested, affirming a University of Qom propagandist’s claim that “fighting Evangelical Christianity is one of our core issues.” By Iran’s definition, the term “Evangelical Christians” frequently identifies converts from Islam to Christianity. According to Western experts, there are potentially hundreds of thousands of these converts. They are variously accused of “acting against the regime,”“threatening na-tional security” and, interestingly, of “promoting Zionist Christianity.” “Zionist Christianity” was explained to me by a former Iranian house church leader. New converts from Islam treasure the Bible – a book most of them have never seen before, and they read it voraciously. There they discover its accounts of the Jews – of the Patriarchs, the Exodus and the journey to the Promised Land. They begin to understand Israel’s existence as a God-given miracle. For these converts, Islamist chants of “Death to Israel” stir feelings of solidarity with the Jewish people. Despite its appalling human rights and religious freedom record, Iran continues to be some-what successful in its international outreach, stretching even beyond the Middle East into Af-ghanistan, Pakistan and several African nations. However, in recent months, Iran’s mullahcracy is reportedly in dire financial straits, thanks to US-led international sanctions. Hezbollah and Hamas have both complained that their funding has been slashed dramatically. At the same time, the people of Iran are suffering; angry pro-tests about soaring costs of living have erupted in many Iranian cities. To make matters worse, in recent days massive floods have submerged 25 of Iran’s 31 provinces, and rage against the regime is boiling over among those who’ve lost their homes and livelihood. Once again, Iran’s people pay the price for the government’s feckless emergency planning and rescue efforts. Tragically, 42 deaths have been reported, and the final costs will be incalculable. Adding insult to injury, a 4.5 earthquake jolted the region on March 30, amazingly close to the Bushehr nuclear facility. Another struck two days later near the Iraq border, measuring 5.2. With all this in mind, one can only wonder what the future holds for the Islamic Republic. De-spite its struggling economy, is the regime able to sustain its investment of billions of dollars in multiple battlefields? And at what price in blood and treasure will Iran implement “Phase Two” of the Islamic Revolution? Among Iran’s many transgressions, surely the most egregious has been its clandestine project to produce a deliverable nuclear weapon – no doubt meant to undergird its ruthless efforts to “export the revolution.” For this and innumerable other reasons, the international communi-ty’s most urgent and pressing tasks in the Middle East should be to expose the ayatollahs’ de-ception, to further intensify financial pressure on the regime, and above all else, to ban the Iranian bomb.

The heartstrings of American Jews,www.jpost.com,DANIEL MACHLIS,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/The-heartstrings-of-American-Jews-585964,"The heartstrings of American Jews Why is the ‘dual loyalties’ trope antisemitic? By DANIEL MACHLIS April 6, 2019 22:38 b U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) takes part with Democratic leaders (including U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, left) during the announcement of the introduction of the Equality Act at the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, U.S., March 13, 2019. (photo credit: LEAH MILLIS/REUTERS)
In 2012, Ilhan Omar tweeted: “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” Now, as a member of the House of Representatives, she has called opposition to her criticism of Israel to be “all about the Benjamins” and has said that she wants to discuss “the political influence in this country that says it is okay for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.”There has been a lot of controversy over these statements, and controversy about the controversy. Many on the Left, including some American Jews, have defended Omar. Some excuse these statements as expressing legitimate criticism of Israeli policy, legitimate concerns about the United States’ relationship with Israel, and legitimate concerns about money in politics. Others view Omar as being unfairly maligned by conservatives because of her progressive credentials and her background as one of the first Muslim women in Congress, and so feel compelled to come to her defense. However, by denying Jews the bleak privilege of defining and identifying antisemitism themselves, and by blindly taking Omar’s statements as they could be superficially read instead of reading between the lines and seeking to understand the historical context for the antisemitic tropes used therein, defenders of Omar hypocritically fall for the same genre of partisan trap as those across the political spectrum who defend Trumpian and alt-Right dog whistles. First, it is important to acknowledge that it is okay to criticize the policies and actions of the Israeli government – it is in fact neither antisemitic nor anti-Zionist to do so. Where criticism of the State of Israel crosses into antisemitism is not a blurry line. It is very clear and it really has only a few manifestations, the one at hand being accusations of dual-loyalty toward Jews in the Diaspora. Such accusations have been a trope of hatred toward Jews for thousands of years, and are a central element of the Book of Esther which is read on the upcoming holiday of Purim.THE ISSUE with the “dual loyalties” antisemitic trope is not that it is false prima facie, as naturally there is a bond between American Jews and Israel. The issue is that it masks more insidious characteristics common to antisemitic canards in general. Accusations of Jews’ allegiance to a foreign country imply that by being loyal to Israel, American Jews are actively subversive in their involvement in American politics to the detriment of the United States. We know this to be false – to gloss over the reasons: Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East and shares our social and ethical values; Israel is a staunch ally with whom we cooperate on security issues and intelligence gathering; Israel and America share many economic interests, scientific pursuits, cultural phenomena and much more. If there is any country for which an American citizen, Jewish or not, is to have an affinity, Israel should be on the shortlist.The fact that the “dual loyalties” card is once again being used against Jews in particular is an indication that it is founded in antisemitism. Why may other peoples share familial or fraternal bonds with foreign countries, but when Jews do so, it is subversive and disloyal to our home country? This form of xenophobia has been used against other groups – notably toward the Japanese during World War II, for example – but in all cases it is driven by bigotry. Not any less so now that hatred and fear of Jews is in vogue once again.Painting Jews as having “dual loyalties” is a tried and true method of “otherizing” Jews and painting them as evil, when to the contrary, America Jews have proudly served their country from the beginning. American history will never forget Haym Solomon, whose efforts nearly single-handedly enabled the financing of the Revolutionary War at great personal cost. American history will never forget Jewish military service, Jewish participation on the front lines of the civil rights movement, and Jewish cultural, scientific and business achievements that contributed to making this country what it was prior to Trump.On the other side, Jewish history will never forget America being the first nation to separate church and state, and to protect freedom of religious expression in its founding document. Jewish history will never forget the moving words of our first president in his letter to the Jews of Newport, Rhode Island, in 1790. Jewish history will never forget America’s reception of countless Jewish immigrants looking for a better life, fleeing from pogroms and Nazis. Jewish history will never forget our essential role in defeating fascism in World War II. Jewish history will never forget that the United States of America was the first country in the world to recognize the State of Israel, 11 minutes after its independence was proclaimed. Jewish history will never forget the friendship and support offered to Israel in its critical early years. Jewish history will never forget the prosperity, safety and welcoming home that America has provided for its Jewish citizens. The heartstrings of American Jews are not tugged in opposing directions. Allegiances are not zero-sum games. The writer is a management consultant.

MULTAN, Apr 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) ::The use of low quality seed is major cause of decline in production of pulses in the country as huge amount of Rs 102 billions is being spent annually to import the commodity.
Apart from this, selection of marginal soil (less fertile-deserts), lack of mechanization, water shortage and poor marketing system are also some important factors, damaging pulse sector, this was stated by Director Arid Zone Research Institute (AZRI) Bhakkar , while talking to APP here on Sunday .
Pulses are grown at an area of 3.2 million hectares in the country but the major area is less fertile, he informed.
The country faced shortage of 275,000 tonnes of chickpea, 66,000 tonnes moungbean, 166,000 tonnes mash and 160,000 tonnes of lentil pulse annually. Pakistan used to import these pulses, largely from Australia and Canada , Dr Khalid stated.
About per acre production of pulses in the country, the expert informed that Pakistan was achieving 200 kilogramme per acre while Australia was getting 1400 kilogramme.
About reason behind extremely low production, Dr Khalid said that the country was faced with issue of seed quality. The funding on research on pulses were meagre, he said hinted that Pakistan was spending huge amount Rs 102 billions on import of pulses annually.
To a query that how can Pakistan promote pulses, he recommended, they they have to work on availability of quality seed, selection of fertile land and improvement in marketing system to invite farmers attention towards production of pulses.
About marketing, another expert on pulses Dr Ammar from Muhammad Nawaz Sharif University of Agriculture observed that they should delay pulses imports and wait for arrival of indigenous pulses because it would offer handsome price to our farmers. ""We would be focusing on protein rich pulses"", he remarked.
When questioned about pulses consumption in the country, he stated that consumption of pulses is on rise. The growing population is important factor behind the increase in consumption of pulses.
To a query how can they improve pulses production, Dr Ammar suggested that pulse crop zones should be fixed. Similarly, quality seeds, agricultural mechanization, and provision of sprinkle system especially in Thal area could help getting bumper production and save huge amounts, being spent on import of cotton ."

Talking to APP. UNICEF chief of WASH said, "" Balochistan is a scarcely populated province where it is easy to manage welfare projects through integrated efforts."" He added that the major issue was of difficult accessibility due to remote areas, law and order situation in some areas and weak administration order in the province.
He lamented the absence of private sector in Balochistan which was aggravating the situation as private partners played a key role in implementing public welfare and human development initiatives in any region.
He said there was greater political will in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for implementing WASH projects whereas Punjab had always been proactive.
Gebre said, ""UNICEF has sensitized around 1.98 million people across the country on open defecation hazards out of the total set target of 10 under the five years country programme (2018-2020).
The Chief of WASH said,"" Around 25 million people in Pakistan are practicing open defecation which we aim to educate in order to mitigate its risk through our country programmes."" Gebre said water quality was a bigger issue as 64 percent people had access to poor drinking water which was not reliable and safe.
""UNICEF has planned to upgrade Water , Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) facilities in 1,250 schools along with scaling up health care facilities in 1,250 units under its country programme,"" he informed.
Gebre said these are not one time achievements, adding, "" We aim to provide affordable, easy to access and reliable clean drinking water to 30 million people."" ""The incumbent government is going to launch Clean, Green Pakistan School awareness programme which is parallel to UNICEF's initiative.
However, these 1,250 schools exclusively are public sector institutes which will be developed as a model for private sector schools,"" he said.
The opportunity, he added, had been increased with inoculation of the government . The number of schools had reached to 11,000 schools and might exceed further, he added.
He also informed that UNICEF has supported provincial governments for WASH strategies where each province had the WASH in school strategy.
To a question, he said, the UNICEF's Nutrition Sensitive Intervention (NSI) project in Sindh was being carried out with the assistance of US-AID. It also involved government , public and private partners with civil society in its implementation process.
""Over a half million population of rural Sindh has got benefited through it,"" he added.
Gebre said, ""We have managed to bring over 2,000 villages open defecation free. The masses there have been made well aware of WASH and proudly tells any visitor coming to their areas about practicing WASH facility.""/ 778"

ISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :The unprecedented and accentuating air pollution in the country particularly in Punjab province and exclusively in Lahore has reduced life expectancy and increased child mortality risk due to exceeding levels of hazardous ambient pollutants.
Talking to APP, Dr Junaid Rashid of Children Hospital Lahore (CHL) said being the biggest children hospital on the globe it had witnessed record visits of 814,434 child patients to the health care as compared to 436,000 patient visits in 2008.
""It's huge as most of the visiting patients are coming to CHL from outside the city, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and even Afghanistan ,"" he lamented.
He said, ""Indoor patients' admissions have been recorded 230,422 in 2018 doubled the number noted in 2008. However, 11,750 children with Asthma disease developed have been brought in 2018 which is alarming and requires imposing health emergency across the country not only in one region."" Senior physician Dr Junaid Rashid in his research in the light of global environmental reports had found augmented vulnerability of infants; children below 5-year and 15-year age were at the verge of developing grim respiratory and health complications.
He said pharmaceuticals visiting hospitals were mentioning increased sale of nebulizers, air pumps and cough syrups due to increase in respiratory issues arising among the children.
""There is no trend of such huge amount of consuming cough syrups around the world . One thing that has been creeping environ is indoor or household pollution whereas research conducted by Agha Medical College has revealed underweight child birth among pregnant women using kerosene oil , coal and wood stoves,"" he underscored.
He said the study had further discovered wood particles in carpet, smoking puffs suspended into the air, mosquito killer spray, coils and air fresheners were also causing indoor air pollution which was not realized by masses generally.
""Around the world , 52,000 deaths in children of age cohort 5-15 years have been reported to be air-pollution induced in a year. However, the infant mortality rate under 5-year has been 543,000 deaths per year,"" he added.
""There is an urgent need to bring paradigm shift in behaviours and attitude towards environmental issues. education and awareness stands paramount in mitigating air pollution either ambient (outdoor) or household (indoor) air pollution risks,"" he suggested.
Dr Ishaq, a senior doctor based in the Federal capital also conducted a research to study the allergic propensity between both the genders of different age groups.
He said ambient pollution no doubt had turned the federal capital into pit of allergy for pollen sensitive patients as earlier due to prolonged rainfalls it reduced the pollen season occurrence but at present with over a dry week going it had increased the number of allergic patients visiting the hospitals.
He said the study was conducted among 140 adults which resulted into 60.7 percent female gender predominating the overall sample of allergy sensitive individuals.
""Around 80 percent patients reported to have respiratory allergies during pollen season and 20 percent throughout the year,"" he added.
He advised the citizens to use dust and pollution masks to avoid pollen allergy attacks and also abstain from visiting parks in the evening hours and unnecessary outdoor visits during the season. However, the allergic patients should also avoid soft drinks rather prefer to drink warm water which would help them improve their health.
According to Met Office, pollen concentration had increased gradually and reached the level of 42,292 (per m3of air) in H-8 sector on 28th March , 2019 . However, rainy and windy weather conditions were expected in next couple of days which might decrease pollen concentration.

- Jobs , jobs , and more jobs - Young people voted for Modi in droves in 2014 after he said he would create 10 million jobs a year.
Many, however, have been left disappointed -- and jobless.
A newspaper recently published what it called an official report buried by Modi's government showing unemployment at its highest since the 1970s.
Last year a staggering 19 million people applied for 63,000 positions at Indian Railways.
The opposition has used unemployment as one of its main lines of attack in the campaign, with Congress chief Rahul Gandhi attacking Modi for creating a ""national disaster"".
Analysts say that the economy has failed to expand at the rate required to employ the one million Indians who enter the workforce every month.
- Corruption crackdown - In 2014, Modi projected himself as an anti-corruption crusader who would eradicate graft and so-called ""black money "".
While Modi has been widely credited with ending a culture of crony capitalism throughout government his overall record on corruption is mixed.
He has been lauded for toughening anti-corruption laws, including one outlawing ""benami"" property, where owners purchase real estate through third parties to hide money .
However, Modi's first term will perhaps most be remembered for a shock cash ban that rendered 86 percent of the high-currency bank notes void overnight and hit growth.
Modi said ""demonetisation"" would root out illegal money but almost all notes returned to the banking system, while the move caused untold suffering to millions of poor who operate outside of India 's formal economy. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"
