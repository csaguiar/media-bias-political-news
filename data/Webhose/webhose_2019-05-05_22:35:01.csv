Stockholm, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The chairman of Swedbank, the Swedish lender accused of money-laundering in Baltic countries, stepped down on Friday, the bank said a week after the board sacked its chief executive.
""Lars Idermark has, with immediate effect, decided to leave the role as chair of Swedbank. Thereby, the current deputy chair, Ulrika Francke, will become new chair,"" the bank said in a statement.
Swedbank has been embroiled in scandal since February when an investigative news show on public broadcaster SVT claimed to have seen documents showing that at least 40 billion kronor (3.8 billion Euros , $4.3 billion ) of suspicious transactions had been channelled to Baltic countries from Swedbank accounts.
Many of the transactions took place between 2007 and 2015 , and some of the money may have first transited Danske Bank , which is at the centre of a giant money-laundering scandal .
Last week, Swedbank's board fired CEO Birgitte Bonnesen over the scandal .
US financier Bill Browder, who has made an international career of going after money-launderers, reported Swedbank to the Swedish economic crime authorities (EBM) over the allegations.
But EBM announced on April 1 that it would not open a criminal investigation due to the five-year statute of limitations and because the events occurred before Sweden 's anti-money laundering laws were tightened in 2014.
Browder has appealed that decision.
However EBM is investigating Swedbank for fraud and insider trading, as the lender is suspected of favouring its 15 biggest shareholders by informing them two days in advance of the contents of the SVT news report.
Swedish and Estonian financial supervisory authorities are meanwhile probing the money-laundering allegations.
An internal Swedbank report obtained by SVT claimed that many of the bank 's ""high risk customers should never have been approved"", and, in some cases, the bank ""did not even know who the real owners of the accounts were, nor where the money was coming from ."""

According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, around 10 million people in North Korea � roughly 40 percent of the country's population � required humanitarian assistance as of last summer."

SEOUL, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon was given a true surprise gift by a Chinese guest making a friendly visit to South Korea on Friday -- a portrait of a political rival.
Ma Xingrui, governor of the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, and a delegation of the province's business leaders visited Seoul City Hall for talks with Park on expanding bilateral economic cooperation.
After signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on closer economic cooperation, Ma said he had prepared a surprise gift for Park and presented him with a portrait of a Korean man . The Chinese government added that the portrait is a drawing of Park.
On removing its wrapping, however, the Seoul mayor was stunned to find a portrait of the governor of Gyeonggi Province, Lee Jae-myung.
""The Chinese side belatedly learned after the MOU-signing ceremony that the man in the portrait is the wrong person. They politely apologized for the mistake and took it back,"" an official at Park's office said.
""Working-level officials from both sides examined the gifts to be exchanged between the two leaders yesterday. But the Chinese side wanted its gift to be unveiled on the day of their meeting because it is a surprise gift,"" the official said.
Officials speculate Ma's office may have mistakenly given Lee's photo to Chinese portrait painter. Park presented Ma with a gift of traditional craftwork and photos of Seoul .
Ma and his Chinese delegation are separately planning to have a meeting with the governor of Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds Seoul .
Park and Lee, both belonging to the ruling Democratic Party, are among a pack of South Korea 's prospective presidential candidates for the 2022 elections.
Lee and Park were the preferred choices of 7.1 percent and 5.9 percent of respondents, respectively, in a recent poll of prospective presidential candidates. The poll was led by Hwang Kyo-ahn, chairman of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, who secured 21.2 percent."

UNITED NATIONS, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :India's claim that its fighter pilot shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet in a dogfight in February is wrong, Foreign Policy, a prestigious American magazine, said in a report quoting US defense officials.
""Two senior US defence officials with direct knowledge of the situation told Foreign Policy that U.S. personnel recently counted Islamabad 's F-16s and found none missing,"" the magazine said in a report published on Thursday.
India had claimed that in an aerial duel on February 27 - a day after its war planes dropped bombs in Balakot that Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman had engaged with one of the Pakistani fighter jets that targeted Indian military facilities and shot it down before he was hit and forced to eject.
Varthaman was captured by Pakistan Army was returned to India amid attempts to de-escalate the crisis between the two sides.
The Indian Air Force had on February 28 displayed pieces of the AMRAAM missile, fired by a Pakistani F-16, as evidence. But that, by itself, does not offer any clues on whether Varthaman had shot down a Pakistan Air Force F-16, as has been repeatedly claimed by the government and the IAF.
According to the Foreign Policy magazine, Pakistan invited the United States to physically count its F-16 planes after the incident as part of an end-user agreement signed when the foreign military sale was finalized.
""A US count of Pakistan 's F-16 fleet has found that all the jets are present and accounted for, a direct contradiction to India 's claim that it shot down one of the fighter jets during a February clash,"" correspondent Lara Seligman of the magazine reported.
The count has been completed, and "" all aircraft were present and accounted for"", an American official is quoted as saying."

TAIYUAN, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The restoration project of an ancient Chinese town started this week under Sino-French joint financing, according to local tourism authorities.
Qixian ancient town in north China 's Shanxi Province received a 20-year loan of 70 million Euros (78.6 million U.S. Dollars ) granted by French Development Agency last year, with another 139 million Yuan (20.7 million U.S. dollars) from China .
It is the first loan provided by the agency to support the restoration and development of cultural heritage in China . The fund will be used mainly to repair old buildings and renovate infrastructure.
""We need the money because our buildings are on the brink of collapsing,"" said Yan Dianzheng, an official with the local tourism bureau, noting that the town was facing many challenges as some residents still burned coal for heating.
Restorations are set to start in October and scheduled to be completed in six years, Yan said.
He expressed the hope that Qixian would share France 's experience and ideas in preserving ancient cities and towns.
Yann Martres, an official with the agency's Beijing office, said it would be a model of cultural heritage protection with the exchange of experience and technology , and would strengthen the cooperation between France and China .
Historical records show that the 0.3-hectare Qixian ancient town dates back to the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534), with more luxurious architecture than surrounding towns.
So far, more than 6,000 local residents are living in 1,000 old folk houses built in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). When the restoration project finishes, the town is expected to apply for the status as a 5A tourist attraction, the top grade in China ."

NEW YORK (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 05th April, 2019) Pakistan pointed to the lack of implementation of Security Council resolutions on occupied Jammu and Kashmir as an example of the 15-member body's inability to fulfill its responsibility.Speaking in the General Assembly 's intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform, Pakistan 's Ambassador at the United Nations ( UN ), Maleeha Lodhi , said this was another compelling reason for reform of the world body.""Solemn promises have been broken, on not one, but several resolutions on Kashmir, and undertakings reneged on"", she said in her comprehensive statement in the two-day session that began on Thursday.Urging reform of the Council's working methods, Ambassador Lodhi said that such moves should be aimed at enhancing the transparency, openness and inclusive decision making in the functioning of the body.""It goes without saying"", Ambassador Lodhi stressed, ""that the majority of member states attribute the non-transparency and exclusive nature of working and decision-making of the Council to its permanent members.Referring to Pakistan 's experience, having served seven times as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, she said that elected members had done more to reinvigorate the working methods of the world body.
Therefore an expansion in the Council in the permanent category could imperil those gains.Stressing that the ideal of a more transparent and open Council should not be mortgaged to the narrow interests of a few countries, Ambassador Lodhi maintained that aspirants for permanent status in the Council will necessarily fail to prioritize collective good over individual interest. ""We know only too well that Permanent members of the Council jealously guard their domain.
There is no reason to believe that that any new permanent members would act otherwise"", she added.""We, therefore, need to increase, not diminish, the ratio of non-permanent to permanent members"", she stressed.She underscored that the best way to ensure a responsible and accountable Council would be to strengthen the role and authority of the General Assembly in determining its representation in the Council.""If elections and accountability are fundamental to our governments, parliaments, regional and international bodies and multilateral institutions"", she asked, ""why should the Security Council be an exception to this?Ambassador Lodhi emphasized that so called �quick fix' solutions that aim to address substantive issues of Security Council reform without finding common ground would be counter-productive.

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) has annulled the decision of the southwestern Okinawa Prefecture to cancel land reclamation permit that would enable the controversial US military base relocation on the Okinawa Island.
The Japanese government began land reclamation work in Okinawa's Henoko Bay last December as part of preparation to move the US Futenma base there from the more-populated Okinawa's city of Ginowan. The move has been largely criticized by locals, who said that the work was damaging coral reefs in the bay. The Okinawa Prefecture filed a lawsuit against the central government on March 22 in order to cancel Land Minister Keiichi Ishii's decision to start work, suspending an earlier retraction by the Okinawa Prefecture.
The Japanese Defense Ministry filed an objection against the Okinawa Prefecture's decision to revoke the permit and requested the MLIT to reverse the move, and the MLIT ruled on Friday that Okinawa's revocation of land reclamation permit had been illegal, the NHK broadcaster reported.
Keiichi reportedly said that the land reclamation work met all legal requirements, while the prefecture's move to cancel the permit, citing the discovery of soft ground at the seabed side, had no basis. Keiichi also said that experts had come to a conclusion that the problem of the soft ground could be solved via reinforcement operation.
Okinawa Vice Governor Moritake Tomikawa has voiced regret over the MLIT's decision. He pledged that the Okinawa Prefecture would announce new measures after receiving a formal notification from the MLIT.
The US Marine Corps base Futenma was constructed in 1945. Talks on its relocation to a less populated area within the Okinawa Prefecture started over two decades ago, but the government 's plans have been hampered by local residents' protests.
While Ginowan residents have been calling on the government to close the Futenma base due to their environmental concerns, as well as aircraft incidents and accidents related to US servicemen behavior, Henoko residents do not want to see the base relocated to their region either. Okinawans have called on the government to move the US base entirely out of the prefecture's territory."

""A large quantity of components presumably needed to build a 3,000-ton sub, which the North has been developing, have turned up recently at a shipyard in Sinpo, South Hamgyong Province ...

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn, who was rearrested in Tokyo on Thursday amid investigation into his financial misconduct, has ordered payments to Nissan dealers in Oman , who later made up reasons for these transactions, local media reported on Friday.
Earlier in the day, a district court in Tokyo extended Ghosn's detention until April 14. His lawyers reportedly plan to appeal this decision.
According to the NHK broadcaster, Nissan sources have told Tokyo prosecutors that Ghosn had transferred around $34 million as sales promotion expenses from a ""CEO reserve"" account to Oman-based dealers, although these expenses had already been paid from the official budget of the company .
Meanwhile, Ghosn has denied the charges, stressing that the payments had been done appropriately following a request of Nissan officials.
Ghosn was originally arrested in Japan in late November 2018 for underreporting around $44 million worth of his income and misusing company assets. He was released on bail in early March to be rearrested a month later on new suspicions. The new arrest was motivated by prosecutors' claims that Ghosn had inflicted a $5 million loss to Nissan by transferring a part of money , which Nissan 's subsidiary in the United Arab Emirates paid to an Omani distributor, to a firm that he effectively owned.

NATO At 70 Years Old... Time For The Zombie To Die | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-05/nato-70-years-old-time-zombie-die,"0 SHARES
If NATO were a person, it would be five years past retirement age . In fact, as Ron Paul notes , NATO should have retired back in the early 1990s when its reason for existence - the Warsaw Pact - ceased to exist. Instead, new missions had to be created and new enemies had to be made to justify the massive behemoth that provides lush jobs for the well-connected and vast fortunes for the weapons makers. NATO must die and the sooner the better .
When the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created 70 years ago in 1949 it was formed as a blatant military instrument for waging the Cold War, a war that the US, Britain and other European allies had newly embarked on. NATO’s public relations cant about “peace and security” is but Orwellian rhetoric.
But, as The Strategic Culture Foundation notes, the supposed allies of the Soviet Union hastily went from an ostensible joint purpose of defeating Nazi Germany during the Second World War to initiating hostility towards Moscow. Already in 1946, British war-time leader Winston Churchill was fulminating about “an Iron Curtain” descending across Europe, in language adapted from Third Reich propaganda maestro Joseph Goebbels. The ensuing Cold War would last for nearly half a century until the Soviet Union collapsed from its internal political and economic stresses.
NATO’s first secretary general, Britain’s Lord Ismay, was candid in the mission of the military alliance. Its objective, he said, was to, “Keep Russia out, the Americans in, and Germany down”.
Of course, Western propaganda always portrayed the Soviet Union as the “aggressor”, alleging that the so-called Red Menace had designs on conquering all of Europe. Not much has changed when one listens to Western contemporary claims of Russia being an aggressor. As in the past, present innuendo casting Moscow as a demonic force has a decidedly hollow quality, at least for those willing to be critical about Western state and media “information”.
Lord Ismay, perhaps unwittingly, let the cat out of the bag in his statement all those years ago. The purpose of NATO was to serve as a means of dividing and ruling over Europe for Washington and its always closely aligned, servile British partner.
If countering Soviet aggression was the real purpose of NATO, as officially claimed, then one must ask why is this organization still in existence – some 30 years after the alleged “evil communist empire” dissolved?
NATO is a military monster desperately in search of a purpose. The substitution of Russia as an enemy in place of the Soviet Union doesn’t quite hold the same propaganda cachet, but nonetheless that is why Moscow continues to be designated the official “enemy” – in order to justify the existence of NATO. The US-led military bloc needs enemies like a junkie needs a narcotic fix.
NATO’s real function is at least three-fold .
First, it gives the US an excuse to justify its enormous military presence in Europe. Instead of appearing as an occupying force, which it is, the Americans claim to be a protector of allies against malign Russia, or formerly the Soviet Union. This allows Washington to exert political control over its so-called European allies, and specifically to prevent any normalized relations with Russia. US vice president Mike Pence this week scolded Germany and fellow NATO member Turkey for daring to continue relations with Moscow, in the form of the Nord Stream 2 gas project and Ankara’s purchase of Russian S-400 air defense system. Pence inferred treasonous conduct on the part of Berlin and Ankara just because these two nominally independent countries have chosen to do business with Russia. Pence was thus demonstrating the classic NATO purpose of dividing Europe from Moscow.
A second function of NATO is to serve as an extension of the US military-industrial complex and, in turn, an important buttress for American corporate capitalism, which is totally dependent on military spending. When President Donald Trump castigates European allies, like Germany, for not spending enough on military and NATO, his real concern is for European nations to buy more American weaponry, such as the vastly over-priced and over-rated F-35 fighter jet. If NATO were to be disbanded – as it should from its obsolete objective purpose – then US capitalism would suffer a major withdrawal of European subsidy in the form of decreased weapons purchases.
The irony here is that Trump has previously denigrated NATO as obsolete. In his irascibility, he is more correct than he seems to realize. But Trump has – despite superficial griping – still continued to boost NATO for the purpose of hiking European military spending. What Trump means by “obsolete” is that the past financial tribute from the Europeans to the US militarized economy must henceforth be significantly increased. The outrageous demands by Trump are inciting tensions within NATO. At a time of massive civilian social needs across Europe being neglected due to “fiscal constraints”, the American ultimatums for more military spending are bound to be seen by the wider European populace as an intolerable dictate.
A third function of NATO for its American leadership is that it gives a pseudo legal cover of “multinationalism” to what would otherwise be seen as blatant US imperialist aggression all over the globe.
NATO forces have assisted US illegal wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, among other interventions. This by an organization that self-declares itself a bastion of security and peace.
It was 20 years ago that US-led forces under the cover of NATO bombed Serbia and its capital Belgrade. That marked a watershed assault on international law, and the unleashing of US global violence with impunity.
Washington could not carry out its aggression without the political and legal cover of NATO. Jens Stoltenberg, the present NATO secretary general, was in Washington this week calling for more aggression towards Russia. The Norwegian figurehead is a shameless warmonger who is violating the UN Charter for the sake of feathering his career as an American puppet.
It is all the more disturbing that this week in Washington, foreign ministers of the 30 member states belonging to NATO deferred to the US calls for naval forces to be deployed to the Black Sea “in defense” of Ukraine and Georgia from “Russian aggression”. These two countries have done everything possible to provoke Russia. They are cat’s paws for their NATO master, and are reckless enough to instigate a full-on war. Washington and its NATO minions have the audacity, or intelligence deficit, to call such an explosive situation as “defense” against Russia.
NATO, or rather the US, is giving itself a green light to mount even more aggression against Russia than it already has done over the past 30 years. In that period, NATO membership has almost doubled with the result that the military bloc is now on Russia’s border – and at the same time claiming with Orwellian double-think that it is defending Europe from Russian aggression. As Russian wit would have it: Russia has had the temerity to move its border towards NATO offensive forces.
Global security and peace is too serious for jokes. The maintenance of NATO, with its original aggressive objective against Moscow still intact, is a grotesque joke. A joke sickeningly played on the people of Europe who could benefit greatly from halting the squandering of billions of dollars each year on military budgets. NATO’s gratuitous belligerence towards Russia – based on trumped-up, ridiculous propaganda – is an obscenity. This organization is a dinosaur that somehow outlived its Cold War environment because those powers who control it from Washington and London want it to live on for their own selfish, ideological, economic reasons.
For the sake of world peace, the citizens of North America and Europe should demand that NATO be liquidated. Thirty years too late. Tags "

Bucharest, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Friday that France would stick to plans for a tax on digital giants such as Facebook and Apple , despite displeasure in Washington .
""We are determined to implement a tax on the largest digital companies to bring more justice and efficiency to the international tax system,"" Le Maire said as he arrived in Bucharest for talks with his eurozone counterparts.
France last month unveiled draft legislation to set a three percent tax on digital advertising, the sale of personal data and other revenue for any technology company that earns more than 750 million Euros ($841 million ) worldwide each year.
The effort comes amid rising public outrage at the minimal tax paid by some of the world 's richest firms which base operations in jurisdictions that charge low rates.
France drafted the law after a European Union-wide effort it championed was scuttled by low-tax countries such as Ireland , which have wooed big technology firms.
Other countries are considering following France 's lead including Britain, Spain , Austria and Italy .
Le Maire spoke just hours after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo raised his objections to the tax as he met French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in Washington .
Pompeo said the tax would negatively impact US companies ""and the French citizens who use them,"" according to the State Department.
France's Le Maire insisted that Paris would work closely with the US to draw up a global tax reform at the OECD, the organisation of developed countries.
This was the ""better solution"", Le Maire said, adding that he would hold talks with his US counterpart Steven Mnuchin next month to accelerate this process. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

ISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The Chairman of Hurriyat forum, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq , and other organizations in Indian Occupied Kashmir have condemned the authorities' decision of disallowing movement of civilian vehicles on the Srinagar-Jammu highway for two days a week and termed it another anti-people dictatorial move of the authorities.
According to Kashmir Media Service, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq in a tweet in Srinagar asked the authorities to withdraw the order of closing down the highway and it will cause great distress to the people.
The High Court Bar Association (HCBA) in a statement in Srinagar denouncing the banning of civilian traffic on the highway said it is another ploy of teasing and harassing the Kashmiri people and invading into their right to life and liberty.
The HCBA reiterated that the freedom of movement and travel at home and abroad was not only important for securing employment in any part of the world but was also essential for education , trade and also for cultural, political and social activities.
It also took a serious note of the statements of India 's Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, and BJP President, Amit Shah, favouring abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A of the Indian Constitution, terming it as interference in judicial proceedings.
Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry in a statement issued in Srinagar called for immediate revocation of the order banning movement of civilian traffic on the highway. It said the order has been issued without considering its impact on the population of Kashmir and is indicative of the lack of awareness of local problems.
""At a time when the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry has been raising the issue of lack of alternative routes and means of travel to Kashmir, the closure of the only available road link would put the whole population to unimaginable inconvenience and will have disastrous consequences for our economy,"" it added.

SHIJIAZHUANG, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Villagers in northern China 's Hebei Province have decided to bid farewell to a millennium-old ritual during this year's Tomb Sweeping Day for the good of the environment: burning joss paper.
""I think it is a good thing that we stop burning joss paper. Although I did find it difficult at first, I know it is better not to burn joss paper when I thought of the smoke in the past,"" said Tang Lifen, a villager in Liulaoren Village, Fucheng County.
Tomb Sweeping Day, which falls on April 5 this year, is a time for Chinese people to mourn the dead and worship their ancestors by visiting tombs and making offerings. Traditionally, the tributes involve burning incense and joss paper at the tombs.
""Villagers compare with each other, and if you burnt fewer than others, you would be considered as not completing your filial duties. We also had to burn cardboard versions of refrigerators, televisions and ingots,"" Tang said.
""When we stop burning joss paper, our financial burdens are lessened,"" Tang said.
Instead of burning joss paper, this year, villagers held a memorial service and gathered together to recall the spiritual wealth that the elder generation has left for them. They also tied cards with what they wanted to say to their deceased family members on a century-old pear tree.
""We tie these cards on the trees to remind us of the spiritual wealth that they have left for us,"" said Zuo Junxiu, a villager.
""Burning joss paper causes fire and pollutes the air, so we are very sure that we should stop burning joss paper,"" said Liu Lianshan, the village's Party secretary.
About one-third of the villages in the county are turning to greener ways to mourn their deceased family members this year.
""We have decided to call on our villagers to stop burning ghost money and do what we can to protect the environment,"" said Chang Cuncai, Party secretary of Suliu village in the county."

SEJONG, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The government will quickly prepare for an extra budget bill, a top official said Friday, amid growing downside risks over worsening economic conditions at home and abroad.
Lee Ho-seung, the first vice minister of economy and finance, made the comments in a meeting with officials on innovation-led growth in Seoul .
The government is set to submit an extra budget worth about 9 trillion won (US$7.9 billion ) to parliament later this month to cope with fine dust and boost the slowing economy and job creation.
An extra budget is subject to parliamentary approval. Last year, South Korea 's parliament approved an extra budget bill worth 3.83 trillion won to create jobs for young people and help industrial regions grappling with massive layoffs.
The move came as Asia 's fourth-largest economy suffered a setback in production, investment and consumption in February .
Adding to the economy's woes, the country's exports declined 8. 2 percent in March from a year earlier, marking the fourth straight month that outbound shipments have fallen.
Also Friday, Lee said the government will speed up policy tasks to try to revitalize the economy and improve people's livelihoods.
In particular, the government will come up with measures to address challenges facing young people at a time when some young South Koreans are abandoning three of life's major milestones -- dating, marriage and having children -- as well as their dreams, and hope that things will get better.
A 2017 survey released by Statistics Korea showed 29.5 percent said they believe their children can climb the social ladder, down from 48.4 percent in 2009.
Separately, the central government has granted subsidies worth 10.53 trillion won to the Seoul metropolitan government and seven other major cities, as well as nine provincial governments across the country, according to the Ministry of Economy and Finance Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

The growth speed of private vehicles in Shanghai slowed down for the second year, reaching 5.11 million in 2018 , a year-on-year increase of 420,000, said a report published by the Shanghai urban and rural construction and transport development research institute.

United States may designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist group, according to the Wall Street Journal. The groundbreaking move, which could be announced as early as next week, would be the first time the U.S. labeled another country's military a terrorist organization.
Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps has a large impact on the country's operations. It influences the Iranian economy and political system, and oversees its ballistic missiles and nuclear programs.
U.S. officials have contemplated the terrorist group designation for years. Back in 2007, they did so for the division of the group that executes international operations for ""its support of terrorism,"" but fell short of updating the designation for the entire security force.
Iran has previously warned of a ""crushing"" response should the U.S. go through with the change. A senior Iranian lawmaker said the country may respond by putting the U.S. on its terrorist list. Opinions in the U.S. have been split — with some officials praising the move and others warning of the impact it could have on U.S. troops in the region.

Hong Kong, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : Asian markets mostly rose in holiday-thinned trade Friday on hopes that China and the United States will hammer out a trade deal after both sides sounded notes of optimism.
With top negotiators from the world 's top two economies huddled down in Washington for three days of talks, there has been a growing sense they are close to an agreement to end a stand-off that battered global equities last year.
Donald Trump on Thursday added to the sense of hope when he said the two sides were nearing a successful conclusion.
""We will probably know over the next four weeks. It may take two weeks after that,"" he told reporters following a meeting with Beijing 's top trade envoy and Vice Premier Liu He.
""It's looking very good."" Later Liu said they had ""reached a new consensus on important issues"", according to China 's Xinhua. The news agency also reported that President Xi Jinping had called for the ""early conclusion of negotiations"".
Both camps have been cautiously optimistic for months, but the last mile is proving to be the hardest as they tussle over whether and when Washington should remove the painful tariffs it imposed on Chinese goods last year.
While the news was once again upbeat, Asian markets were unable to press ahead with the rally that has characterised the past two weeks, with Hong Kong and Shanghai closed for holidays .

With an April 12 deadline for leaving on the horizon, May is desperately searching for votes to pass an agreement she struck with the EU months ago.
Brussels must decide whether to grant her plea for another delay to May 22, with one option being for a longer extension that could give Britain time to rethink Brexit and possibly reverse its decision to leave.
""A Brexit extension is the most likely scenario from here, the length of which could be decided by Labour backing Theresa May 's deal, in which case it would be a short one"" said OANDA analyst Alfonso Esparza.
""Or no deal is passed and the UK (asks) for a longer extension, the length of which would have to be decided by the EU and which could be the end of Brexit "" if there is a new referendum or new elections, both of which he said are likely scenarios.

ISLAMABAD (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 05th April, 2019) The more gadgets that become available to us, the more we may feel tempted to explore these new technologies, but their constant claims on our attention could end up harming our health.At home and in the workplace, various technologies compete for our attention: Computers, smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches all urge us to prioritize different tasks and rewards with their push notifications and the appeal of social media .And even when we sit down at the dinner table with our partners or catch up over coffee with a friend, some of us may feel tempted to whip out our phones and check for new likes and messages on our various media accounts, switching from one app to the next.According to a new study from Rice University, in Houston , TX, Dartmouth College, in Hanover, NH, and The Ohio State University, in Columbus people who often switch between forms of digital media are more likely to be overweight or have obesity and to have poorer self-control.""Increased exposure to phones, tablets, and other portable devices has been one of the most significant changes to our environments in the past few decades, and this occurred during a period in which obesity rates also climbed in many places,"" says lead researcher Richard Lopez, Ph. D.""So, we wanted to conduct this research to determine whether links exist between obesity and abuse of digital devices as captured by people's tendency to engage in media multitasking,"" he explains.The researchers report their findings in a study paper that appears in the journal Brain Imaging and Behavior.Lopez and the team conducted two related studies that assessed the link between media multitasking and obesity.
In the first, the researchers worked with 132 participants aged between 18 and 23.The participants answered questions from a specially designed questionnaire aimed at evaluating how much they multitasked and how easily they got distracted for instance, whether they felt the urge to check messages on their phones while having in-person conversations.At this stage, the team found that individuals who scored high on the media multitasking questionnaire had higher body mass indexes and more body fat than participants who had low scores."

The symptoms can worsen over time until the person can no longer take care of themselves and live independently.According to a 2018 report from Alzheimer's Disease International, there are close to 50 million people worldwide with dementia, and this figure is set to triple by 2050."

Washington (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 05th April, 2019) US defense officials have debunked India 's claim that it shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet in an aerial dogfight between the two sides in February .Two senior US defense officials with direct knowledge of the situation told Foreign Policy magazine that US personnel recently counted Pakistan 's F-16s and found none missing.The findings directly contradict the account of Indian Air Force officials, who said that Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman managed to shoot down a Pakistani F-16 before his own plane was downed by Pakistan Air Force, the publication states.The count, conducted by US authorities on the ground in Pakistan , casts doubt on India 's version of events, suggesting that Indian authorities may have misled the international community about what happened that day, it adds.According to Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at MIT , the details look worse and worse for India , just days before the start of the general elections there.""As details come out, it looks worse and worse for the Indians,"" Foreign Policy quoted Narang as saying.
""It looks increasingly like India failed to impose significant costs on Pakistan , but lost a plane and a helicopter of its own in the process. ""One of the senior US defense officials said that Pakistan invited the United States to physically count its F-16 planes after the incident as part of an end-user agreement signed when the foreign military sale was finalised.The count has been completed, and "" all aircraft were present and accounted for,"" the official said.Tensions soared between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of the February 14 suicide bombing in Pulwama, occupied Kashmir. India piled the blame for Pulwama bombing on Pakistan without presenting any proof.
The allegations were strongly refuted by Pakistan .In response, India said it carried out on February 26 air strikes on what it called a militant training camp at Balakot inside Pakistan .The Indian government was quick to take credit for a ""successful"" airstrike and put the death toll to over 300.
Pakistani officials, as well as the locals, rejected the claims, inviting local and international media to visit the site of the so-called attack where around a dozen trees were the only ""casualty"".The Pakistan Air Force, in retaliatory action, downed two Indian aircraft the next day, capturing Indian Wing Commander Abhinandan who was then released as a peace gesture by Pakistan ."

London (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 05th April, 2019) European Council President Donald Tusk is proposing to offer the UK a 12-month ""flexible"" extension to its Brexit date, according to a senior EU source.His plan would allow the UK to leave sooner if Parliament ratifies a deal, but it would need to be agreed by EU leaders at a summit next week.The UK 's Conservatives and Labour Party are set to continue Brexit talks later.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has told the BBC that if they fail, the delay is ""likely to be a long one"".The UK is due to leave the EU on 12 April and, as yet, no withdrawal deal has been approved by MPs.Downing Street said ""technical"" talks between Labour and the Conservatives on Thursday had been ""productive"" and would continue on Friday. Prime Minister Theresa May has said a further postponement to the Brexit date is needed if the UK is to avoid leaving the EU without a deal, a scenario both EU leaders and many British MPs believe would create problems for businesses and cause difficulties at ports. On Wednesday, MPs voted - by a majority of one - to force May to ask the EU for a further extension.However, the PM wants to keep any delay as short as possible.To do that, she and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would need to agree a proposal for MPs to vote on before 10 April , when EU leaders are expected to consider any extension request at an emergency summit.If they cannot, May has said a number of options would be put to MPs ""to determine which course to pursue"".Cox told the that particular scenario would involve accepting whatever postponement the EU offered, which was likely to be ""longer than just a few weeks or months"".Europe's leaders have been split over whether, and how, to grant any extension."

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called it one of New Zealand 's ""darkest days"".She has vowed to ban all types of semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles.On Friday morning, Judge Mander ordered that two assessments would be carried out to determine the state of the suspect's mental health.The suspect listened intently during the short court hearing .

He live-streamed the attack from a head-mounted camera and identified himself in the footage.The suspect is then said to have driven about 5km (three miles) to the Linwood mosque where the second shooting occurred.The gunman, armed with semi-automatic rifles including an AR-15, is believed to have modified his weapons with high-capacity magazines - the part of the gun which stores ammunition - so they could hold more bullets.He is currently being kept in isolation at the Auckland Prison in Paremoremo, considered New Zealand 's toughest.Less than a week after the attacks, Ms Ardern announced that New Zealand would ban all types of semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles.She said she expected new legislation to be in place by 11 April .An amnesty has been imposed so the owners of affected weapons can hand them in, and a buy-back scheme will follow.Many in the country are still coming to terms with the mass killings.More than 20,000 people had earlier last month attended a memorial service honouring the 50 victims of the shootings. All 50 Names of the victims who died in the attacks were read out at the event by members of the city's Muslim community.The victims included men, women and children from across the world .

Islamabad (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News – 5th April, 2019) Versatile actress Bushra Ansari has come up with a beautiful rendition of a Punjabi tappa along with her sister Asma Abbas.
The song ‘Humsaye Maa Jaye’ gives a message of peace and love with neighbouring India .
The video features both the sisters, singing from the kitchens with a wall dividing the two neighbours.
While Bushra Ansari acts as the Indian neighbour, her sister Asma Abbas plays the role of Pakistani neighbour.
With this simple Tappa, the two women have shed light on the war-mongering sentiments present in India and Pakistan against the will of their citizens who actually want peace and harmony.
The video has been directed by Iqbal Hussain while the poetry has been written by Neelum Ahmad Bashir.
This music video goes beyond war and borders to the hearts of people living so close, and yet too far.
Watch here:
The long-standing tensions between the two nations escalated after the February 14 suicide attack on a convoy carrying Indian security forces that killed over 40 troops in Pulwama.
India has since been war mongering against Pakistan .
Following this attack , the Indian Air Force intruded into Pakistan 's airspace along the Line of Control on February 26.
India claimed to have targeted an alleged training camp of the Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist organization which had claimed responsibility for Pulwama attack .
Pakistan, which denies any involvement in the February 14 attack , retaliated with airstrikes, downing an Indian jet over the disputed Kashmir region and capturing an Indian pilot.
Pakistan later handed back the Indian pilot as a peace gesture on March 1."

Fanned by strong winds it quickly spread through the mountainous area, incinerating 400 homes and 500 hectares of land, according to the government .
Nearly 4,000 people were evacuated and one person died , authorities said, while 11 were injured .
More than 870 fire engines and some 10,000 emergency personnel were dispatched to fight the blaze, the National Fire Agency said.
The military sent 32 helicopters, along with fire engines of its own and 16,500 soldiers, to help.
""Fortunately, the main fire has been brought under control,"" provincial governor Choi Moon-soon said in a radio interview with YTN, but added that others were still burning.
The central government declared a state of national disaster, entitling affected areas to special assistance including goods and equipment, and banning entry to dangerous zones.
The last time Seoul made such a declaration was in 2007, when a crude oil carrier leaked thousands of tonnes of oil into the sea off the west coast.
President Moon Jae-in told officials to take all measures necessary to battle the inferno, and to liaise with North Korean authorities if the fire approaches the border , the presidential office said."

SIMFEROPOL (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Yuri Gempel, the head of the Crimean parliament 's committee on international relations, called on NATO on Friday to stop expanding its military presence in the Black Sea.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced on Thursday that member states had agreed to boost support for NATO allies Ukraine and Georgia in the Black Sea via enhancing surveillance and information exchange and holding drills. The measures will also include more frequent visits of NATO ships to the Black Sea in order to ensure safety of navigation in the Kerch Strait.
"" NATO states should stop and not cross the red line. The expansion of their military presence in the Black Sea is a provocation, mainly orchestrated by the United States . The aim of such provocations is to invent grounds for creating new military bases closer to the Russian borders. It is appalling how bold they interfere in our state interests,"" Gempel told Sputnik.
He voiced the belief that Russia would provide a sharp response to any provocation, stressing that the country would act within law to protect its interests.
""I am sure that our Armed Forces are able to counter any provocateur in our territorial waters. As for Crimea, there are enough of our forces there so that the population could live and work calmly under the safe sky,"" Gempel added.
Russia has repeatedly accused NATO of expanding its presence near the country's borders."
