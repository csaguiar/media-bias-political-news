Trump Mocks Rep. Omar The Day After One Of His Fans Arrested For Death Threat,crooksandliars.com,Heather,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/trump-mocks-rep-omar-day-after-one-his,"This is what's supposed to pass for humor in Trump-world :
President Donald Trump made a sarcastic reference to Representative Ilhan Omar during a speech in Las Vegas, a day after prosecutors said a New York man was arrested for threatening to murder the freshman Minnesota Democrat.
Trump snuck in the line about Omar minutes into a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition as he ran through a list of Republican lawmakers and others supportive of Israel.
“Special thanks to Representative Omar,” Trump said. “She doesn’t like Israel, I forgot. I’m so sorry, no she doesn’t like Israel, does she?”
Patrick Carlineo Jr., 55, of Addison, New York, was arrested and charged with threatening to assault and murder the Muslim lawmaker in a phone call with one of her staffers on March 21, the Justice Department said in a statement on Friday.
Carlineo allegedly asked, “Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her, she’s an (expletive) terrorist. I’ll put a bullet in her (expletive) skull.”
The FBI, which investigated the threat along with the U.S. Capitol Police, said in a criminal complaint that Carlineo sounded angry during the call but “spelled his name correctly and provided contact information,” the Associated Press reported.
Imagine the outrage on the right if a Democrat had done something even remotely similar to this. Sadly, with this dangerous embarrassment sitting in the Oval Office, it's just another Saturday. Shameful. He's going to get someone killed, and when it happens his supporters and the media will just shrug. Tags:"
Secretary-General’s remarks to the press after visit to the UNRWA Baqa’a camp,www.un.org,United Nations Office of the Spokesperson of the Secretary-General,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/press-encounter/2019-04-06/secretary-general%E2%80%99s-remarks-the-press-after-visit-the-unrwa%C2%A0baqa%E2%80%99-camp,"06 April 2019 Secretary-General’s remarks to the press after visit to the UNRWA Baqa’a camp
It was a very emotional moment for me to enter the classroom of the UNRWA school for Palestine refugees and to see young children learning about and discussing human rights, and then to participate in a student parliament. And to see that in 700 schools, 530,000 Palestine refugee children are learning not only about science and about mathematics or about Arabic, but are learning about human rights, about democracy, about tolerance, making the conditions to be exemplary citizens. And this is something that warms my heart.
This means that these schools cannot close. This means that the assistance provided by UNRWA in health, in education in alleviation of poverty, in the empowerment of women and women’s dignity, all the programmes that UNRWA develops both in the West Bank and in Gaza, or in Jerusalem or here in Jordan, in Syrian and Lebanon. These programmes cannot stop. Not only do they represent a very important contribution to the well-being of the Palestine refugee population, to see their rights being respected, to see their dignity being upheld, but they are also a very important factor of stability.
Can you imagine in the tragic situation of Gaza if all of the schools would close the terrible impact it would have? Can you imagine if here in Jordan, UNRWA would not be able to have its health and education programmes, the devastating impact it would have in a country like Jordan that suffers so many negative impacts from the outside?
I appeal to the international community knowing that UNRWA has been facing extremely difficult financial problems, I appeal to the international community to be able, as it was possible last year, to guarantee that the vital support for the rights of the Palestinian refugees to be upheld, for the stability of the region to be protected. I appeal to the whole international community to maintain in 2019 the level of financing for UNRWA and to make sure that that stability is guaranteed for the following year.
We are in a very difficult circumstance. I just authorized about $20 million dollars for food assistance in Gaza hoping that the donors would be able to match these funds, but the international community has a huge responsibility in relation to the Palestine refugees and I’m sure that once again in 2019 as in 2018, it will be possible to keep all these programmes alive.
I remember last year, the Director-General and me had a phone conversation just before the school year was beginning. He was telling me, “I have no guarantee to have funds until the end of the year, shall we open the schools? I believe we should open the schools.” And I told him of course we should open the schools and let’s pray for the support to come. The schools opened, and the year started and it was possible to find the funds necessary to have everything working.
It is absolutely essential to maintain this activity in 2019 and onwards. I want also to express my deep gratitude to Jordanian government for the support provided, allowing us to operate under these circumstances and once again to guarantee that the Palestine refugees, that for us, their rights and their interests are at the centre of our priorities.
Thank you very much.
Q: I have two questions. The first, how will the UN deal with what became known as the deal of the century? The second is, what do you think about the US President’s decision on the Golan Heights?
SG: Regarding the Golan it is very clear: all UN resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly say that the Golan are part of the Syrian territory and we firmly believe in the territorial integrity of Syria as any other country. On the other hand, I cannot comment on a deal I do not know. What I know is that we believe that the solution for the problems of Israel and Palestine is a two-State solution with Jerusalem as capital of two States living in peace and security together.
Q: Recent efforts haven’t managed to resolve escalation in Libya, what is your comment on that?
SG: We will never give up in our support to the Libyan people.
Q: UNRWA recently received contributions from Japan, Indonesia and other countries, does this mean you can survive without the support of the US?
SG: We still need a lot of support until the end of the year. Last year there was a very important contribution from the Gulf States. There was very solid support from several European countries, from Japan, from other developed countries in the world and we are mobilizing all the international support and there are a number of fundraising initiatives that will be launched during the year in order to make sure that we can get at least the same level of support from last year.
Q: So does this mean you don’t need US support?
SG: I’m not saying that the support is not needed, of course the support would be needed, but if we don’t have that support we are not going to give up. We are going to do everything we can to find ways to replace it.
Q: What are the future initiatives of UNRWA?
SG: We are working very hard with the support of Member States. The two leading states are Jordan and Sweden and there is a number of initiatives that will be launched. There will be a planning meeting in Sweden soon. We believe we’ll have a pledging conference similar to the one we had in Rome last year, probably after Ramadan, in a location we have to decide. There will be the usual New York activities during the General Assembly, and there is a permanent contact with the Member States but also with the private sector. My appeal is also to citizens, to companies, to different organizations of civil society – UNRWA needs to be able to survive in all its activities. Not only the support of the government but the support of people, of institutions, of companies. If there is something that I believe is a fundamental pillar that of Islam is the Zakat. If there is something that is a fundamental pillar of Islam is compassion and it is the need to support those that are in difficulties, so my appeal to the people and to the entities of the civil society and the business community in the Muslim world and everywhere in the world is also to contribute to maintain the activities of UNRWA.
Q: What will happen in Libya now?
SG: As I said, we will not give up our support for the Libyan people. Statements"

Your Majesties, Your Royal Highness, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, all protocol observed, I thank Their Majesties King Abdullah II and Queen Rania Al Abdullah, as well as the people and government of Jordan, for hosting this timely meeting. Your Majesty, it has been a pleasure to work with you across the decades, from my time as Prime Minister of Portugal through my years as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and now in my present capacity. You have always been a champion of peace. And you have been a voice for inter-religious coexistence and mutual respect – as recognized by the awarding of the Templeton Prize for 2018. And I was honoured to join you on that occasion. And you have been an ally of people in need in and beyond the region. Indeed, as we all know, Jordan has demonstrated exceptional generosity to people fleeing conflict and upheaval in Palestine, in Syria and elsewhere, with an enormous impact on Jordan’s economy and society. Two years ago, I visited the Zaatari camp for the fifth time and once again saw Jordan’s generosity in action. This meeting of the World Economic Forum builds on other gatherings earlier this year, in London and Brussels, which marked the start of a new partnership approach between Jordan and the international community in pursuit of sustainable growth and self-reliance. In light of the pressures on the country, Jordan deserves strong solidarity from the international community. But let me also stress the bigger picture and brighter narrative: beyond the impacts linked to the Syrian crisis, the Israeli-Palestine conflict, Jordan is also a country with large investment opportunities for private sector-led growth. And here let me give you my personal examples. When I was High Commissioner for Refugees and in the context of the reform of the Organization we decided to create global ICT Centre to support our ICT activities worldwide. We selected the country to do it based on costs, on the quality of men power and namely digital literacy and also evidently on the infrastructure of the country. Jordan came first. The Centre was built. The results outstanding. So, to all those who are pondering an investment in Jordan. My message is very clear: do what I did, and you will not repent. Jordan remains a fundamental pillar of regional stability, and UN agencies are actively supporting the country’s determined efforts to achieve the Goals. And Jordan is a leading contributor to United Nations peacekeeping, with hundreds of troops and police in several of our operations – another vital generous contribution. Jordan was also the driving force behind a landmark resolution of the Security Council on youth that highlighted the importance of including the voices of young people in our work for peace. With its own large and dynamic youth population, and with the right support, Jordan is poised to reap a demographic dividend. For these reasons and more, I trust that we will see, at this forum, strong and wide-ranging expressions of international commitment to Jordan at this crucial time. This is indeed a critical moment for the region. The United Nations is deeply engaged in a surge of diplomacy for peace – not always successful I must confess - to untie the Gordian knot of conflict and instability. Resolving the region’s conflicts is an imperative – including the two-State solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace with secure and recognized borders, and with Jerusalem as capital of the two countries. And in some cases, I believe there is progress to report. I just came from Tunisia, which successfully held its first free municipal elections last year and where the democratic transition continues to advance. And in Egypt, I spoke with the Grand Imam of Al-Alzhar Mosque about what more we can do to advance tolerance and mutual respect and combat hatred of all kinds. My Special Adviser for the Prevention of Genocide is defining a global plan of action against hate speech, and the High Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations is working on a plan for safeguarding religious sites. And these are two concerns in which Jordan has had a pioneering work in the world that we all respect and admire. I am convinced that it is crucial to look at the Middle East and North Africa not only as an area of conflict, but as a region of opportunities. With smart approaches internally and support from the international community, we can unleash remarkable dynamism and capacity. In recent years, several countries have managed to integrate into their constitutions some of the political demands first articulated in the streets, and to strengthen social protection, good governance and human rights. There have been determined efforts to address violent extremism, that take us beyond security approaches to the challenge. And I want to underline some notable steps against gender-based discrimination, including new legislation on domestic violence, new penalties for sexual harassment, the removal of constraints on the participation of women in labour markets and an increase in women’s representation in parliament and decision-making. Indeed, the empowerment of women is essential. One recent study indicated that achieving full and real gender parity would increase the region’s gross domestic product by $2.7 trillion by 2025. And just as Jordan is striving to empower its youth, so must the entire Arab world, where two-thirds of the people are under the age of 30 – the highest share ever – do the same. This demographic momentum will last for at least the next two decades – and requires a massive investment in education, skills and participation to reap its full potential for development and peace. The most systemic risk facing us all today is climate change. Climate change is moving faster than our efforts to address it. The World Meteorological Organization just reported that we are seeing record highs in land and ocean temperatures, sea levels and greenhouse gas concentrations. And we are seeing, from fires in California to floods in Mozambique, the dramatic impact of extreme weather events. This region will face some of the worst impacts – in particular increased water stress and desertification, which will reduce the amount of arable land and increase dependence on food imports. For Jordan, already one of the world’s driest countries, climate change is likely to exacerbate such pressures and raise new challenges to sustainable development. So it is high time for more urgency and more ambition not only in meeting this stress but in reaping the benefits of climate action. That is why I am convening a Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23rd. I am telling leaders: “Don’t come with a speech; come with a plan” to put us, once and for all, on a sustainable path. I want the Summit to spur more ambitious commitments on mitigation, adaptation and finance. And countries like Jordan that do not contribute much to climate change cannot be the victims of the fact that others are neglecting their own obligations. And I want it to show how everyone can benefit from climate action, from jobs to health. The opportunities in the region are enormous. Just see the potential of renewable energy. Climate action is indeed essential if Goals. The cost of inaction is far greater than what it will require to set us on the path we know will pay huge dividends. And the involvement of the private sector, so well represented in this room, is essential for climate action. So, I count on your support in making the Summit a success. We are in a race against time – but it is a race we can win. Excellencies, Climate change is just one of the challenges on which we need all to act– governments, private sector, innovators, investors and civil society – working in full cooperation as it was highlighted by the President of the World Economic Forum, my dear friend Claus Schwab. Today we live with a paradox: global challenges are more connected, but our responses remain fragmented. Globalization and technological progress have led to remarkable advances – but they also have generated increased inequality and the risk of disruption in job markets. These trends will be intensified within the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and require our adequate collective response. Many people, sectors and regions feel they are being left behind. This has been a factor in reducing trust in political establishments – and in rising populism. The United Nations is pursuing action across many fronts to support Member States in meeting these challenges. We continue to pursue the Goals towards a fair globalization that works for all. I am a multilateralist – and I am deeply convinced that there is no other way to deal with global challenges than with a smart, evidence-based global response, organized in a multilateral way to benefit all."

SCITUATE — Before she steps in the circle, Scituate’s Haley Venturini has one goal.
“To make sure,” the sophomore said, “my defense doesn’t have to work harder than they should.”
The Spartans’ defense could have napped on Saturday. Mixing overpowering fastballs, brutally unhittable risers and spine-snapping changeups, Venturini threw a no-hitter, striking out 21 of the 22 batters she faced in a 4-0 win over Block Island in the first game of their doubleheader at Manning Field.
“I know when it’s going good,” Venturini said. “I know how to keep myself up and if something goes down with my teammates, I know I can bring them up, too.”
Alison Roy was solid in the second game, giving up only one run on two hits while striking out six in the Spartans’ 7-1 win.
“Alison would be a starting pitcher on most of the high school teams,” Scituate coach John Lickert said. “But we’ve got Haley.”
Venturini isn’t a secret, but she was an unknown to the Hurricanes, a Division II newbie, who were simply overmatched.
The only contact the Hurricanes (0-4 in D-II) made the first time through the order were three tips and the second time didn’t go much better. Venturini didn’t throw two balls in an inning until the seventh, when she also had her first three-ball count.
“She’s the fastest pitcher we’ve ever faced, for sure,” Block Island’s Savannah Brown said. “We definitely all had to catch up to her speed and that took us quite a while, even if we weren’t making much contact.”
“It’s just outsmarting the hitters,” said Venturini, who threw 84 pitches, 71 for strikes, “and make sure I throw pitches where they’re supposed to be so the defense can back me up.”
Brown — who broke up Roy’s no-hit bid in the second game with a fourth-inning single — put the lone ball in play against Venturini, a pop to short Roy joked about dropping afterward.
“You zone out [on defense] and that’s not good,” Roy said. “I was zoned out.”
Scituate got off to a hot start in the second game, scoring three runs in the first. Erin Costello drove in two with a double, a welcomed highlight for the Spartans (3-0 D-II).
“We have a lot of new kids, so it’ll take some time to jell,” Lickert said. “A lot of them haven’t played varsity, so I’m just glad we have really good pitching because it should keep us in games until we get better on offense.”

Egyptian Military Attack Victim Pushes Trump To Back Her Case,dailycallernewsfoundation.org,Mary Margaret Olohan,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://dailycallernewsfoundation.org/2019/04/06/victim-of-egyptian-military-attack-pushes-trump-to-back-her-case-against-egypt/,"Egyptian Military Attack Victim Pushes Trump To Back Her Case × Published April 6, 2019 at 8:46am Modified April 6, 2019 at 10:59am Share on Facebook Share Tweet Print
An American woman who was part of a tour group that was brutally attacked by the Egyptian military is now pushing lawmakers to block the sale of 10 Apache helicopters to Egypt until her medical expenses have been fully reimbursed.
Former professional roller skater April Corley thought she was just going on a romantic vacation with her boyfriend in Egypt in September 2015.
Instead, a helicopter full of Egyptian military repeatedly fired on Corley and her tour group, killing Corley’s boyfriend Rafael Bejarano and 12 others and severely injuring Corley. Advertisement - story continues below April Corley and her boyfriend Rafael before they were attacked on Sept. 13, 2015. Rafael reportedly had a surprise for April to give her on the trip — she thinks he was planning to propose. Photo courtesy of April Corley.
The attack took the tourist group completely by surprise, Corley said in an interview Friday with The Daily Caller News Foundation. TRENDING: Ex-SEAL Known for Exposing Stolen Valor Takes on Nathan Phillips –‘Was Refrig Mechanic’
The group, composed of mostly Mexican tourists and Egyptian tour guides , was taking a lunch break from their tour and listening to music. Corley’s boyfriend took pictures of her as she did cartwheels in the desert sand. Then a Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicopter approached and began to fire on them — and proceeded to do so for hours until sundown.
“It felt like they wanted to take everything out, leave no trace left,” Corley told TheDCNF. Advertisement - story continues below
Egypt’s Interior Ministry claims the Egyptian military mistook them for militants, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Egypt ‘s Interior Ministry also said the group was in a banned area. However, the group had the required permits and was traveling with a police escort, according to The Journal. (RELATED: Egyptian Journalist Gets Prison Sentence For Interviewing Gay Man)
Corley described one of the tour guides desperately waving a white scarf to signal they were not a threat. Yet the helicopter repeatedly fired on them, flew away and then returned to fire on them again.
Check out her interview last week with “This Morning” on CBS.
While some of the dead were able to be pulled from the wreckage, many of the bodies had been incinerated, The Middle East Eye reported. In a first-person account published Wednesday by Fox News , Corley revealed two survivors made it to a military checkpoint but soldiers did not come help them for hours. Advertisement - story continues below
“I was left in the desert carnage, surrounded by charred bodies, bloodied and blackened sand, and burning vehicles,” Corley wrote. “It was hell on earth – and a hell I relive every day of my life.”
“They say it was a mistake,” Corley told TheDCNF. “It felt like a massacre.” RELATED: Hamas’ Booming Arsenal Boasts Devastatingly Advanced and Deadly Weapons
Corley’s injuries were so severe Egyptian authorities were forced to transport her from Cairo to Los Angeles for medical treatment. Since 2015, she has been in and out of hospitals, doctors appointments, therapy, and has received help for post-traumatic stress disorder to overcome her trauma from the ordeal.
Formerly a professional roller skater who had performed and trained with celebrities like Madonna, Katy Perry, and Usher, Corley’s lifestyle has severely changed. Advertisement - story continues below
“My life went from being all glitter and rhinestones and roller skates,” Corley told TheDCNF. “I’m so taken down by pain that often I’m surprised when I have a good day when I can get up and do a little bit more. To go from being so vibrant and lively to dealing with all this medical trauma has been severely shocking to my life.
When asked if Friday was a good or bad day, Corley laughed. “Today is an in-between day,” she said.
She was about to head to Fox News as part of the media appearances she has been making while in Washington.
Corley was injured by a Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicopter purchased from the U.S. government. As an American and a taxpayer, Corley’s lawyer told TheDCNF, she paid for that weaponry. Advertisement - story continues below
Now she is ready to demand justice from the Egyptian government. Corley wants Egypt to recognize the damage it has done to her life and to pay her medical bills.
In order for the Egyptian government to compensate for Corley’s past and projected future medical expenses, livelihood, physical and psychological pain and suffering, it needs to reimburse her at least $14,567,320, according to Corley’s lawyers. So far, it has offered her $140,000 in damages.
She also wants to ensure that no more U.S. weapons are used to carelessly harm tourists and wants to create laws allowing U.S. citizens to sue the Egyptian government if they are injured in violent crimes in Egypt.
Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, co-authored a letter with Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, on March 29 in which the two urged U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to finish the sale of 10 AH-64E Apache Helicopters to Egypt for $1 billion until the Egyptian government agrees to repay Corley. The State Department approved the sale on Nov. 27, 2018.

My letter w/ @NitaLowey to Sec. Pompeo: https://t.co/qYJ4EgjliL pic.twitter.com/TiEtCZk61l
— Sen. Patrick Leahy (@SenatorLeahy) April 2, 2019
Corley said Pompeo also raised her case with the Egyptian government in January during a trip to Cairo. She hopes that President Donald Trump will raise the issue with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi when the two leaders meet on April 9 at the White House.
“Postponing the sale would give a clear message to Egypt that they can’t do this to people. I want them to take some accountability,” Corley told TheDCNF.
She also wrote in the Fox piece that the completion of this sale would send the message that Egypt can “use U.S. weapons to kill or injure Americans with total impunity.” Advertisement - story continues below
“I am still seeking justice from the Egyptian government,” she told TheDCNF. “The performer in me feels like I just need to keep giving it my best shot. Having the support of people helping me to tell the story is encouraging. … That connection helps me to put one foot in front of the other.”

Previously Deported MS-13 Gang Member Sentenced to Prison,dailycallernewsfoundation.org,Jason Hopkins,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://dailycallernewsfoundation.org/2019/04/06/previously-deported-ms-13-gang-member-sentenced-to-prison/,"Previously Deported MS-13 Gang Member Sentenced to Prison × Published April 6, 2019 at 12:04pm Modified April 6, 2019 at 1:29pm Share on Facebook Share Tweet Print
A previously deported MS-13 gang member from El Salvador was sentenced to one year in prison for illegally re-entering the United States.
Fily Giovany Amaya-Martinez was handed down a one-year prison sentence on Friday by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Amaya-Martinez, a 36-year-old known member of MS-13, was deported from the U.S. in 2003 after being convicted of an aggravated felony near Washington, D.C.
However, he returned to the U.S. in 2009 after being charged with several murders in his home country of El Salvador. Advertisement - story continues below
Amaya-Martinez was able to live in the U.S., undetected, for nearly a decade until he was discovered by an anti-gang task faced in 2018.
“Amaya-Martinez fled justice in his home country and defied the laws of this country when he illegally reentered,” Lyle Boelens, the acting field office director for Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) enforcement and removal operations in Washington, D.C., said.
“Today’s sentencing answers his defiance. We stand with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in resolute commitment to continue to ensure that our communities are safe from dangerous criminals.”
The case was hailed as an example for the need of strong immigration enforcement. Advertisement - story continues below
“After allegedly committing multiple murders in El Salvador, this violent MS-13 gang member fled El Salvador and illegally crossed our southern border to get back into the United States,” G. Zachary Terwilliger, the attorney and chief federal law enforcement officer for the Eastern District of Virginia, stated.
“This case is a prime example of our need for strong borders and why this office continues to prioritize criminal immigration cases. My thanks to the dedicated anti-gang task force agents for their outstanding work on this important case, and for removing this dangerous felon from our community,” Terwilliger continued.

Amaya-Martinez’s sentencing comes as the Trump administration continues to clash with congressional Democrats over immigration and border enforcement.
The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, a five-member board that controls the House of Representatives’ general counsel, voted 3-2 along party lines on Thursday to initiate a lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s emergency declaration on the southern border.
Democrats, with the help of some GOP support, had previously passed a resolution that commended his border emergency. However, Trump vetoed the resolution and lawmakers were not able to override it. Advertisement - story continues below
U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen has also asked Congress to pass a series a measures to alleviate the immigration situation, but with Democrats controlling the House, these requests are not expected to be met.

Former Middle School Teacher Claims She Felt 'Pressured' To Perform Sex Acts on Teen,dailycallernewsfoundation.org,Neetu Chandak,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://dailycallernewsfoundation.org/2019/04/05/former-middle-school-teacher-claims-she-felt-pressured-to-give-oral-sex-to-teenager/,"Former Middle School Teacher Claims She Felt ‘Pressured’ To Perform Sex Acts on Teen × Published April 5, 2019 at 2:22pm Modified April 6, 2019 at 12:55pm Share on Facebook Share Tweet Print
A former California middle school teacher said she felt pressured to kiss and give oral sex to a student Wednesday.
Justine Nelson, 33, a former teacher at Tenaya Middle School, said an eighth-grade student threatened to expose their relationship to school officials unless she was intimate with him, the Fresno Bee reported.
She was afraid of not only losing her job, but also her child. Advertisement - story continues below
Deputy District Attorney Liz Owen asked Nelson where in the nearly 100 pages of Instagram messages did the boy threaten the former teacher. Nelson said the threat happened in person, according to the Bee.
Nelson said in one instance, the boy allegedly walked into her classroom and kissed her after pushing her onto a desk in between classes. He left after Nelson screamed his name, The Bee reported. TRENDING: Ex-SEAL Known for Exposing Stolen Valor Takes on Nathan Phillips –‘Was Refrig Mechanic’
“It’s a natural instinct to kiss a child who just pushed you down on a desk?” Owen asked.
Nelson said yes, according to the Bee. She also admitted to giving the boy oral sex after he reportedly pressured her constantly. Advertisement - story continues below
Nelson added she was “sick and tired” and “wanted to get it over with,” the New York Post reported.
The student, however, said in a separate testimony that Nelson allegedly started the relationship and the sex act occurred multiple times, according to the Post.
The alleged offenses happened on school grounds in 2016, when the teen was 13 years old.
He is currently 16 years old, according to The Bee.
Nelson faces felony charges of lewd or lascivious acts with a minor and oral copulation and could be in prison for eight years and eight months if convicted, according to The Bee. Advertisement - story continues below
“We’re not going to comment on the matter but can confirm Ms. Nelson was hired as a teacher in August of 2013,” Vanessa Ramirez, Fresno Unified School District public information officer, told The Daily Caller News Foundation via email Friday.
“Her last day with Fresno Unified was November 10, 2016.”

Government for the People,www.mattersofprinciple.com,Gary Hart,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.mattersofprinciple.com/?p=1662,"Government for the People Author: Gary Hart
There is nothing wrong with our economy that getting rid of all those bureaucratic regulations won’t cure, seemed to be the mantra of Ronald Reagan and generations of Republicans before and after. That, together with tax cuts and military spending pretty much summarized his governing philosophy. Oh, and there was that quaint notion of balancing the budget also, but President Clinton was the last one to do that and deficits have grown under all Republican presidents since Reagan.
What are regulations and why do we have them? The passengers of the two recent Boeing 737 Max 8 planes probably could not have told you, but they were assuming US Government officials in the FAA had written regulations for their operations and trained pilots on the requirements of those regulations.
Wrong assumption because the FAA, which still does not have a director confirmed by the Senate more than two years into the Trump administration, chose to let Boeing certify its own planes, crews, and their performance. That was the easy way around those pesky federal regulations on flight safety. And people died.
We have regulations because Congress is not capable of spelling out the detailed functions of complex legislation that it passes. That is for career civil servants who apply the laws to everyday circumstances to protect the public interest. They are not “out of control”. They are well trained and highly accountable to the Congress that passed the laws.
If there is a “deep state”, it is populated by thousands of career civil servants who know the laws and how they should be applied in everyday circumstances.
Tragically, the sloppiness of the FAA is being mirrored in virtually all federal agencies. From cabinet level officers down, the natural resource agencies such as Interior and EPA, the education department, the health and safety agencies, and almost all others are administered by political appointees whose philosophy is laisse faire, whose loyalty is to Trump, and whose connections are with the industries they are supposed to regulate under the law .
Meanwhile, those industries, whether airplane manufacturers or extractive resource companies, rewrite restrictive regulations behind closed doors in their own interests and not in the public interest.
The damage being done to the public’s land and resources and our environment will take years, possibly decades to repair. Because at least until the last election, the Republican Congress refused to hold the regulation wreckers to account. American peoples’ lives, their health and safety, and their children’s legacy have been jeopardized in the service of “too much government.”
Political ideologies and beliefs have consequences. Whether food and drug inspections, climate protections, transportation safety, or a host of other public interest laws and regulations, we take government protection for granted because presidents take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States.
That oath is being violated daily now and people’s lives are at stake.
Under the Constitution, Congress is obligated to oversee the operations of the Executive branch to ensure that the laws it has passed are being faithfully executed. But if you are a Republican Senator whose ideology is opposed to “big government”, and your campaigns are financed by regulated industries, you are certainly not inclined to hold regulators to account. Indeed, you are most inclined to tell them to lay off your corporate friends who we expect to obey the law.
Knowing little to nothing of the national government and how it operates, or is supposed to, under the Constitution, Donald Trump found himself hamstrung from eviscerating regulatory agencies and decided that there was a “deep state” out to thwart him. Even a casual reading of the Constitution or open-minded lecture on how government works would have let him know that the so-called “deep state” was composed of knowledgeable career civil servants doing their jobs.
But, of course, with this president that is too much to ask.
As a result, everyday Americans and their children will live with the deregulatory chaos that has resulted. Pick your airplanes, as well as your food and medicine, very carefully. “Government for the People”"

Why set this up, but give NOTHING? Because the whole purpose was to have a trail of Russian bread crumbs leading right up to the Trump Campaign doorstep - without actually helping them of course!"

While establishment GOP are not nearly as good as having a Conservative, with Democrats you get the following:
1. Higher taxes
2. More regulation on business
3. Stricter gun control
4. Hate speech laws
5. Infanticide and government funded infanticide
6. Full Amnesty for all illegals (that's what they hope for)
7. More welfare programs
