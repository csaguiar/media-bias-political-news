"'Our Hopes in the Hand of Our Creator': Trump on Synagogue Attack, Venezuela, Religious Freedom",www1.cbn.com,,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/may/our-hopes-in-the-hand-of-our-creator-trump-on-synagogue-attack-venezuela-religious-freedom,"'Our Hopes in the Hand of Our Creator': Trump on Synagogue Attack, Venezuela, Religious Freedom
WASHINGTON – On Thursday the country came together simply to pray. The National Day of Prayer is held on the first Thursday of May each year, and people of all faiths came together at the White House to pray.
""On this day of prayer we once again place our hopes in the hand of our Creator,"" Trump said.
The National Day of Prayer kicked off in the Rose Garden with a call for Americans to follow 'The Golden Rule.'
This year's theme was ""Love One Another"", designed with the goal of putting aside politics for prayer.
""As we unite on this day of prayer, we renew our resolve to protect communities of faith and to ensure that all people can live, pray and worship in peace,"" said Trump.
President Trump said prayer is needed now more than ever in the wake of attacks on places of worship.
Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein spoke out after getting wounded during a shooting at a synagogue near San Diego.
""Mister President when you called me, I was at home, weeping,"" Goldstein said. ""You were the first person who began my healing.""
The Commander-in-Chief then prayed for healing in Venezuela where tensions have reached a boiling point.
More protestors are expected there as opposition leader Juan Guaido renewed his calls this week for the overthrow of dictator Nicolas Maduro.
""The brutal repression of Venezuelan people must end,"" Trump said.
""The Bible says pray for all those who are in authority and that's a long prayer list,"" Pastor Jack Graham said.
Pastor Graham is on the President's Faith Advisory Council.
He told CBN News they met Wednesday about mobilizing Christians to help with the humanitarian crisis at the border and tasking churches to help revitalize cities through economic development.
""These are urgent times and we need to pray not just 'easy does it' prayers but we need to pray with compassion and passion,"" Graham said.
President Trump also showcased new faith-based protections for healthcare workers as well as faith-based adoption.
He also touted how federal employees can now take paid time off to observe religious holidays."
How Israel Stopped Syria from Becoming a Global Nuclear Nightmare,www1.cbn.com,,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/may/how-israel-stopped-syria-from-becoming-a-global-nuclear-nightmare,"On September 6, 2007, shortly after midnight, Israeli fighters advanced on Deir ez-Zour in Syria. Israel often flew into Syria as a warning to President Bashar al-Assad. But this time, there was no warning and no explanation. This was a covert operation, with one goal: to destroy a nuclear reactor being built by North Korea under a tight veil of secrecy in the Syrian desert.
Gordon Robertson talks with Yaakov Katz about his new book, Shadow Strike , on Friday's 700 Club.
Shadow Strike tells, for the first time, the story of the espionage, political courage, military might and psychological warfare behind Israel's daring operation to stop one of the greatest known acts of nuclear proliferation. It also brings Israel's powerful military and diplomatic alliance with the United States to life, revealing the debates President Bush had with Vice President Cheney and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert as well as the diplomatic and military planning that took place in the Oval Office, the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, and inside the IDF's underground war room beneath Tel Aviv.
These two countries remain united in a battle to prevent nuclear proliferation, to defeat Islamic terror, and to curtail Iran's attempts to spread its hegemony throughout the Middle East. Yaakov Katz's Shadow Strike explores how this operation continues to impact the world we live in today and if what happened in 2007 is a sign of what Israel will need to do one day to stop Iran's nuclear program. It also asks: had Israel not carried out this mission, what would the Middle East look like today?

""Don't stop fighting - the battle has already won,"" he wrote in a heartfelt message on Instagram Thursday.
""Fight for what you love and who you love don't let fear and anxiety win...God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power love and of a sound mind!"" Bieber said, quoting 2 Timothy 1:7.

A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on May 2, 2019 at 6:59am PDT
Although the pop star has been very open about his faith in Christ, he says he still struggles with his identity as a child of God.
He recently reached out publicly for prayer, admitting his struggle with depression in the aftermath of years of wild living. But he told fans a few weeks ago that ""God is faithful and UR prayers really work.""
Now he's continuing that conversation on Instagram saying, ""I haven't believed the truth about myself - I haven't believed I am loved - I haven't believed I am forgiven it's a hard thing for me to wrap my head around. I hang my head in shame and I wallow in sadness about the people who have betrayed me.""
Then he put the focus on Jesus.
""Jesus has given me freedom and the pursuit of getting to know his character is never ending. God's character never changes - he is the same yesterday now and forever. He is always good! I won't be afraid to be vulnerable before him.. his power is made strong in our weakness. God isn't afraid of your pain and your brokenness he actually welcomes it. Come to me all who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest! these are words from Jesus!""
He encouraged others to put their trust in Jesus as well.
""There is hope and it's in him!! He loves and cares for you! For God so loved the world that he gave his only son so that whoever believes him won't die but have eternal life! You are that whoever and he accepts you as you are!! He loves and forgives you and welcomes you into his arms every time you mess. He is a perfect and loving God who adores you!""
Bieber regularly uses his huge social media platform to share the gospel message with his more than 100 million followers.
He recently married model Hailey Baldwin, who told Vogue magazine in 2016 that she believes God has given her fame to ""not be quiet about Him, but to reach people and inspire people.""

'Dangerous': Facebook Permanently Bans Anti-Semite and Right-Wing Activists from Platform,www1.cbn.com,,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/dangerous-facebook-permanently-bans-anti-semite-and-right-wing-activists-from-platform,"'Dangerous': Facebook Permanently Bans Anti-Semite and Right-Wing Activists from Platform 05-03-2019 Emily Jones Instagram & Facebook Logos
Facebook announced that it has permanently banned ""dangerous individuals and organizations"" from its main platform and from Instagram.
Anti-Semite and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, Infowars founder Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, and Paul Joseph Watson are among the high profile figures purged from the platform.
Facebook says these figures violated the company's policy against hate and violence.
""We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,"" a statement from a Facebook representative said, according to The New York Times . ""The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.""
Facebook told CNN that when making its decision, it examines if the person or organization has ever called for violence against people based on ethnicity, race, or nationality, used hate speech, or identifies with a hateful ideology.
Most of the personalities Facebook deplatformed Thursday are also banned from Twitter.
Some are happy to see these figures removed from social media.
""The social media companies not only have the right, but an ethical responsibility to remove disinformation and hate speech and those who spread it from their platforms,"" Paul Barrett, deputy director of New York University's Stern Center for Business and Human Rights told the Times.
But critics believe the censorship is dangerous.
Journalist Tim Pool, who reports on social media censorship, believes Facebook made a mistake.
""I cannot stress how much of a dramatic escalation this is. I don't care whether you like these people or not this is going to rapidly radicalize many, many people,"" he said. Very weird and the people who got banned of didn't know before it happened.

Economist and political commentator Eric Weinstein says Facebook does not consistently enforce its anti-hate policies.
""I'm not a free speech absolutist. Nor is the US absolutist. Companies are not the government,"" he explained.
""What I oppose here is *simple* statements from Tech Utopians about how they are against *all* Hate, Violence & Misinformation while *selectively* enforcing & profiteering."" The great danger is selective, cryptic & inconsistent rules tilting all discussion. This leads to an appearance of 'conversation' that can sway opinion, elections, civil society etc.

JERUSALEM, Israel - The Palestinian Authority is urging Russia to help solve its financial crisis after Israel began deducting terror salaries from its monthly transfer of tax revenues to the PA.
The Jerusalem Post reported Friday that the PA rejected a solution from the European Union to provide funds to Palestinian terrorists' families on a needs-based system, but refused to give any money to terrorists themselves.
""There have been attempts to find alternative channels to pay the prisoners and martyrs allowances, which we will not accept,"" PA Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Information Nabil Abu Rudaineh said on Thursday.
""Israel must pay the whole funds without any deductions,"" Rudaineh continued, adding that Israel ""must honor all agreements and pay the funds in full.""
PA President Mahmoud Abbas met with head of the Russian Representative Office in Ramallah Aganin Rashidovich on Thursday and discussed the PA's financial crisis with him.
The Jerusalem Post did not say what the Russian response was.
Abbas claims that Israel's decision to deduct terror salaries from the monthly transfer of tax revenues to the PA has put the Palestinian economy on the verge of collapse.
The Palestinian Authority is protesting Israel's decision by refusing to accept any of its tax revenues, which according to the UN, makes up 65% of the PA's budget.
On Thursday, Israel's public broadcaster KAN reported that the PA rejected and returned to Israel the tax and tariff revenues that it had received at the beginning of the week, which totaled to about NIS 500 million ($138.8 million). Palestinian officials said this was the third time the PA has refused to accept the money since the beginning of the year."
American Jews on Guard After Recent Attacks Prove Anti-Semitism is Alive in America,www1.cbn.com,,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/may/american-jews-on-guard-after-recent-attacks-prove-anti-semitism-is-alive-in-america,"American Jews on Guard After Recent Attacks Prove Anti-Semitism is Alive in America 05-03-2019 Aftermath of the Chabad of Poway synagogue attack in California (AP Photo)
JERUSALEM, Israel – Israel is calling on the world to take renewed action against anti-Semitism.
This comes after a spike in hateful acts including last week’s deadly attack on a US synagogue, the second in six months.
""Barely six months ago we saw the worst attack on Jews in American history,” Israel’s UN ambassador Danny Danon said while addressing the UN. “We spoke about it right here. From the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh to the Chabad synagogue in Poway California, anti-Semitism is no longer a fringe bigotry in the US.”
Danon spoke just days after a 19-year-old gunman fired on worshippers in the Chabad synagogue in California, killing one woman and injuring three others.
It was eerily similar to the October tragedy in Pittsburgh where another lone gunman attacked a synagogue killing eleven.
Both had posted anti-Semitic remarks online prior to their actions.
“Then as now, all the right people are saying all the right things. They express their sympathies and call for an end to this violence and bigotry. But it seems we have learned nothing from the Pittsburgh attack. And it will likely to continue to do nothing following the attack in San Diego,” he said.
Danon wants action, saying the time for just talk is over.
“Those who engage in anti-Semitism must be punished. Whether it's here at the UN, political leaders, editors, policy pundits or college professors it doesn't matter…. until it becomes criminal this bigotry will persist,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Anti-Defamation League released statistics showing that anti-Semitic acts in the US alone more than doubled in 2018.
David Schizer, head of the Joint Distribution Committee tells CBN News the Jewish community has to be brave and do the best it can.
“I think we always have to be vigilant, needless to say, to be American and Jewish is an incredibly comfortable thing. This is the greatest place in the world to be if you’re Jewish but it doesn’t mean everyone in the country necessarily feels that way,” he explained.
Robert Dunn, who is a Philadelphia native, says he’s not afraid to be identified as a Jew but says they have to be careful.
“We have to protect ourselves and our family. When we go to synagogue particularly during high holidays we now have security and I’m always looking around to make sure that I recognize most if not all the people in the synagogue,” Dunn told CBN News.
Researchers at Tel Aviv University confirmed the spike on a global level.
""We have seen among Jews worldwide, but especially in Western Europe and in Northern America, a rising concern, a rising feeling of insecurity -- a feeling of doubting their belonging to their place, of being part of society around them and of the political parties they used to be part of.,” said Professor Dian Porat.
Porat says this puts tremendous stress on the Jewish people.
She cautions against reports that indicate attacks might be decreasing.
“There is more protection of sites, of community centers, synagogues etc. and less Jews, and this is I would say is a tragic phenomena.""
For now, vigilance is the answer but in the long run authorities must find a way to uproot anti-Semitism and stop it in its tracks."
High School May Remove George Washington Mural that 'Traumatizes Students and Community Members',www1.cbn.com,,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/high-school-may-remove-george-washington-mural-that-traumatizes-students-and-community-members,"High School May Remove George Washington Mural that 'Traumatizes Students and Community Members' 05-03-2019 Mark Martin President George Washington (Painting by Gilbert Stuart: Public Domain)
A mural depicting the ""Life of Washington"" on the walls of George Washington High School in San Francisco may be removed, following the recommendation of a working group.
The San Francisco Unified School District may take down the 13-panel mural because of concerns it offends and demeans Native Americans and African Americans.
""SFUSD convened a 'Reflection and Action Working Group' that was comprised of members of the local Native American community, students, school representatives, district representatives, local artists and historians,"" a spokeswoman for the district, Laura Dudnick, told The College Fix .
The group, which met in recent months, decided the mural ""traumatizes students and community members.""
""At its conclusion the group voted and the majority recommended that the 'Life of Washington' mural be archived and removed because the mural does not represent SFUSD values,"" Dudnick continued.
Victor Arnautoff, a Russian American painter and professor of art, helped paint the mural 83 years ago, according to the Richmond District Blog . The Richmond District is a neighborhood of San Francisco. The Works Progress Administration funded the project as part of the New Deal.
Advocates who want to keep the mural on the walls say the recommendation by the working group ignores the artist's intention and is an effort to erase history.
Historian Fergus M. Bordewich wrote in the The Wall Street Journal , ""A San Francisco mural has become the latest high-profile target of self-appointed censors who want to erase both history and art of which they disapprove.""
""The mural's painter, Victor Arnautoff, was a protégé of Diego Rivera and a communist,"" Bordewich wrote. ""He included those images not to glorify Washington, but rather to provoke a nuanced evaluation of his legacy.""
Bordewich also issued a statement to CBN News about the mural: ""The activists and bureaucrats who are determined to remove or destroy an artistically superb and historically accurate set of 1930s murals presenting the life of George Washington are guilty not only of embracing willful censorship but they are also astonishingly ignorant of the history they want to suppress. The claim that the murals somehow celebrate African-American slavery and the genocide of Native Americans is absurd. In his will, Washington freed every slave he owned and provided for them financially. And he advocated an exceptionally enlightened policy toward native tribes. The artist also, by the way, presented enslaved people and Native Americans not in any degraded or demeaning way but as people of both strength and dignity. There's nothing wrong with debating the meaning of our national history, but those who challenge it ought to at least get their facts right.""
Bordewich told The Fix there ""is a deeply wrongheaded habit to project today's norms, values, ideals backwards in time to find our ancestors inevitably falling short.""
Dudnick says the mural could stay on the walls of George Washington High School, however. She said the superintendent and staff are now looking over the working group's recommendation and considering what should be done with the artwork.
CBN News reached out to the San Francisco Unified School District for comment. At the time of publication, the district had not yet responded to our inquiry."

NKorean Defector Details Persecution and False Religion of Kim's Regime: 'They Are Not Gods...

Choi Jeong-hun is a former member of the North Korean military but defected in December of 2016.
He is currently visiting the United States for what's known as the North Korean Freedom Week, an event held each year for the liberation and free unification of North Koreans.
""I come from North Korea and China border area in Yangang Province,"" Jeong-hun told CBN News via a translator. ""In 1988, I was enlisted to the North Korean military. In '94 I was in Mirim military academy. In 1997, I became a lieutenant.""
Jeong-hun is also a Christian.
As a member of the North Korean military, he shared how he had witnessed the execution of high-ranking military officials at the hands of Kim Jong Un's brutal regime.
""If you criticize them or these kind people, those who were not compliant, regardless of who they are, they are getting execution or they get harshly penalized,"" said Jeong-hun.
He went on to say, ""For example, just like Jang Song-thaek, who was his uncle, he was using a machine gun to kill his uncle. In North Korea, only the direction of Kim Jong Un, they regard it as this is the order that comes from god. Therefore, so if you are not compliant to his directives or if you criticized them, then there is merciless - they go to concentration camps or were executed. I have seen firsthand and I have also seen all these people who experienced this.""
Jeong-hun also explained the false religious beliefs of the North Korean dictator.
""Kim Jong Un has his own sort of religion and he cripples the people mentally in North Korea,"" he said. ""The people who lived as a Christian, when Kim Jong Un, when he took the leadership of North Korea, they were mostly executed.""
He added that many Christians who escaped execution, went on to spread the gospel, including himself.
""Me, after I defected, to the North Korean people I am showing them that Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un, they are not gods and to show them there is a real God and also to renew the things that they know in North Korea that these are wrong.""
Jeong-hun arrived in South Korea in 2006 and now works to secretly spread the gospel of Jesus Christ and the word of God to believers inside North Korea via flash drives, memory sticks and other technology.
Possessing a Bible in North Korea could get you 15 years of hard labor in a prison camp, or worse.
Yet Jeong-hun says the mission must go on.
""We are spreading them inside North Korea,"" said Jeong-hun.

State Attorney General Vows to Fight Human Traffickers Who 'Enslave Children and Adults' at Kentucky Derby | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,Benjamin Gill,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/state-attorney-general-vows-to-fight-human-traffickers-who-enslave-children-and-adults-nbsp-at-kentucky-derby,"The 145th Kentucky Derby takes place this weekend. But the state's attorney general is warning that the legendary horse race draws more than sports fans. Like every major sporting event, the Derby also attracts human traffickers.
Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear said, ""The grim fact is large sporting events like the derby draw not only racing enthusiasts, but also individuals who have enslave children and adults and enslave them for sex and labor.""
Beshear, Advocates: 'Help Us Find Human Trafficking Victims' during Derby: Everyone encouraged to know the signs of human trafficking and report it - https://t.co/2RG9Vp0hBJ pic.twitter.com/a9mosSDQuK

""Victims are also the most marginalized, victims of abuse and violence, runaways, refugees and immigrants, the lost, the lonely, the left behind. That's exactly who my faith says we are supposed to service,"" Beshear said.
The state attorney general says Kentucky is partnering with Catholic Charities to train 9,000 people on how to spot and report trafficking during the derby.
At a recent press conference, Beshear called on citizens to help fight trafficking by recognizing the signs:
There is no one single indicator of human trafficking, but a combination of any of these signs is commonly seen in victims:
Traveling in groups and may have identical tattoos or branding. Unable to identify what town or state they are in or where they are staying. Lacking official identification documents or personal possessions. May appear malnourished or have physical injuries. Avoiding eye contact and adhering to limited, scripted or rehearsed responses in social interactions. May express a loss of sense of time. Possessing multiple pre-paid credit cards One woman shared her tale of being trafficked at the derby at a press conference. Summer Dickerson says she was sitting on Millionaire's Row at the Kentucky Derby four years ago and no one knew she was being trafficked.
""Four years ago, I was being sold on Oaks and Derby. Four years later, I'm part of the solution,"" she said. Now she's running the Women of the Well ministry to help rescue trafficking victims.
Amy Leenerts, founder and director of Free2Hope, is also fighting trafficking at the Derby. Her group runs a Derby outreach program which is specifically aimed at helping child victims.
""This year Free2Hope is focusing its efforts on our Derby City Traffic Jam, which works to identify and assist runaway and missing kids who are vulnerable to traffickers at all times, but even more so with the increase in demand for commercial sex that large events like Derby inevitably bring,"" said Leenerts.
Donna Pollard, founder of Survivors' Corner, says it's a year-round battle.
""This time of year should be filled with jubilation for everyone in our community, but unfortunately the crowds drawn for these celebratory events are used to enslave and exploit the vulnerable,"" Pollard said. ""Human trafficking has devastating long term impacts on victims and their families, but with the leadership and support of Attorney General Andy Beshear, our community has hope for healing and prevention.""
In the weeks leading up to the Derby, Beshear has been speaking out.
""By raising awareness with partners, our community will be better prepared to stop traffickers this Derby,"" said Beshear. ""While there is no one single indicator of trafficking, there are several signs that are common in victims including traveling together, having identical tattoos, branding and not being able to identify where they are or where they are staying.""
Meanwhile, Beshear tweeted his support for People Against Trafficking Humans and ""their 7th annual Anti-Human Trafficking Prayer Service and Public Awareness Rally"" which took place this week ahead of the Kentucky Derby.

Mohammad Tawhidi calls himself an ""Imam of peace"" and is urging fellow-Muslims to support Christians and other people of faith who routinely suffer for their beliefs.
""We are all brothers in humanity before brothers in faith,"" Tawhidi told CBN News .
Tawhidi is a third-generation Iranian-born Muslim from Australia and author of The Tragedy of Islam.
He uses his Twitter and Facebook accounts to warn the world about the growing dangers of radical Islam.
""If Christians don't wake up, if Christians leaders don't wake up, then we Muslims who fled from extremists can't help you anymore,"" Tawhidi told CBN News in an interview . ""We tried warning you.""
Tawhidi says out-of-control multiculturalism and political correctness are allowing radical Muslims with their dangerous and deadly ideology, to flourish.
""When we come to the West and try to warn the governments and intelligence agencies about what is happening, about the people we fled from, we have this new political correctness agenda that tells us that 'oh, we are the racists, we are the ones who are traitors and the extremists need to be understood and embraced'.""
This week, he was in Canada taking part in ceremonies commemorating the Holocaust. I flew to Toronto to light the candles of #YomHashoah2019 , with over 20 faith leaders, at the first multi-faith commemoration of the Holocaust.

""I flew to Toronto to light the candles of #YomHashoah2019, with over 20 faith leaders, at the first multi-faith commemoration of the Holocaust,"" Tawhidi wrote on Twitter. ""May the rest of the world stand in solidarity with the Jewish People."" This is rather a remarkable transformation for a Muslim who reportedly just a few short years ago had very different view of Jews.
""Five years ago, I used to curse them,"" Tahwidi admitted. ""Today I am standing in solidarity with them.""
Dov Hikind, former New York state assemblyman and a Jewish American, recently wrote about Tawhidi saying: ""I'm proud to call @Imamofpeace Imam Tawhidi a personal friend as well as a friend of the Jewish people and an advocate for a peaceful humanity. He's someone who has well internalized the lessons of #neveragain and has much to teach people from all faiths and backgrounds.""
Tawhidi responded, writing : ""You are Jewish, and I am Muslim. We are on the same path, just on different lanes. Side by side we will take on the enemies of humanity.""
As you can imagine, fellow-Muslims have ridiculed him for building relations with Christians and Jews.
""My friends asked why I changed teams?"" Tawhidi asked rhetorically on Twitter recently. ""As though they didn't know why,"" he retorted.
""For many years we have been lied to {that} 'the Jews are the enemy, kill them.' And I do not want to be in a position where I have to 'kill Jews, or shoot their children; even in a laser tag game,"" he wrote on Twitter.
And now he's coming to the defense of Christians who are being persecuted in unprecedented numbers around the world.
""We are all human beings,"" Tawhidi told CBN News . ""If I don't side with you against ISIS that wants to kill both of us, then what is my purpose in life.""
Shortly after the Islamic terror attacks in Sri Lanka, Tawhidi tweeted , ""If you are silent about #SriLankaAttacks, know that this is an Islamist war against Jesus. Pick a side.

Looking back, Tawhidi says he's horrified at how his Muslim faith has treated people of other religions.
""When I was 12, our fledgling Muslim community in Australia bought a Church and converted it into a Mosque,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""The Imam gathered us all to wash the inside of the building with running water to purify it from the 'impurities of the Christians.' I was scrubbing all night. How pathetic.""

The Imam gathered us all to wash the inside of the building with running water to purify it from the “impurities of the Christians.” I was scrubbing all night. How pathetic.

Tawhidi applauded President Trump this week when his administration announced plans to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terror organization. Such a designation would make the Muslim Brotherhood and its partners vulnerable to harsh economic and travel sanctions imposed by the US. ""The Muslim Brotherhood is the most organized extremist terrorist organization on this planet,"" Tawhidi told CBN News . ""Yes, I do support {the decision} and more power to President Trump.""

Conservative commentator and economic analyst Stephen Moore is out, President Trump announcing Thursday that Moore withdrew his bid to serve on the Federal Reserve Board.
The action came after weeks of brutal attacks from the establishment media and critics on the Left who made accusations against Moore's character and qualifications for the job at the Fed.
In a tweet, Trump said Moore was a ""truly fine person"" who ultimately decided to withdraw from the process.
But he wants to keep working with Moore saying, ""Steve won the battle of ideas including Tax Cuts ....and deregulation which have produced non-inflationary prosperity for all Americans.

BOOM: Unemployment Hits 49-Year Low as US Employers Step up Hiring,www1.cbn.com,,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/may/boom-unemployment-hits-49-year-low-as-us-employers-step-up-hiring,"BOOM: Unemployment Hits 49-Year Low as US Employers Step up Hiring 05-03-2019 Associated Press Economy
WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. employers added a robust 263,000 jobs in April, suggesting that businesses have shrugged off earlier concerns that the economy might slow this year and now anticipate strong customer demand.
The unemployment rate fell to a five-decade low of 3.6% from 3.8%, though that drop partly reflected an increase in the number of Americans who stopped looking for work. Average hourly pay rose 3.2% from 12 months earlier, a healthy increase though unchanged from the previous month.
Friday's jobs report from the Labor Department showed that solid economic growth is still encouraging strong hiring nearly a decade into the economy's recovery from the Great Recession. The economic expansion is set to become the longest in history in July.
Many businesses say they're struggling to find workers, yet each month they seem to add a substantial number. Some have taken a range of steps to fill jobs, including training more entry-level workers, loosening educational requirements and raising pay sharply.
Years of steady hiring have sharply lowered unemployment for a range of population groups. The unemployment rate for women fell last month to 3.1%, the lowest point since 1953. The rate for Latinos dropped to 4.2%, a record low since 1973, when the government began tracking the data.
For Asians, joblessness has matched a record low of 2.2%. And the unemployment rate for veterans of the Iraq and Afghan wars dropped to 1.7%, also a record low.
Most of last month's job growth occurred in services, which includes both higher-paying jobs in information technology and lower-paying temporary work. Manufacturers added just 4,000 jobs. Construction firms gained 33,000, mostly on public infrastructure projects.
Professional and business services, which include IT networking jobs as well as accountants and engineers, led the gains with 76,000. Education and health care added 62,000 jobs, while a category that mostly includes restaurants and hotels gained 34,000.
The brightening picture represents a sharp improvement from the start of the year. At the time, the government was enduring a partial shutdown, the stock market had plunged, trade tensions between the United States and China were flaring and the Federal Reserve had just raised short-term interest rates in December for a fourth time in 2018. Analysts worried that the economy might barely expand in the first three months of the year.
Yet the outlook soon brightened. Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the Fed would put rate hikes on hold. Trade negotiations between the U.S. and China made some progress. The economic outlook in some other major economies improved. Share prices rebounded.
And in the end, the government reported that the U.S. economy grew at a 3.2% annual rate in the January-March period - the strongest pace for a first quarter since 2015. That said, the growth was led mostly by factors that could prove temporary - a restocking of inventories in warehouses and on store shelves and a narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit. By contrast, consumer spending and business investment, which more closely reflect the economy's underlying strength, were relatively weak.
But American households have become more confident since the winter and are ramping up spending. Consumer spending surged in March by the most in nearly a decade. A likely factor is that steady job growth and solid wage increases have enlarged Americans' paychecks.
Businesses are also spending more freely. Orders to U.S. factories for long-lasting capital goods jumped in March by the most in eight months. That suggested that companies were buying more computers, machinery and other equipment to keep up with growing customer demand.
Housing, too, is rebounding after home sales had slumped in the second half of last year. Mortgage rates rose to nearly 5% last fall as the Fed raised interest rates. With the Fed now putting rate hikes on hold, borrowing costs have declined.
In February, sales of existing homes jumped by the most in three years. And in March, more Americans signed contracts to buy a house. Contract signings usually lead to finished sales one to two months later.

Religious Freedom Upheld: Christian Leaders Praise Trump's New Conscience Protections for Health Workers,www1.cbn.com,,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/may/religious-freedom-upheld-christian-leaders-praise-trumps-new-conscience-protections-for-health-workers,"President Donald Trump took action on the National Day of Prayer Thursday to protect health care workers and organizations that object to procedures like abortion or assisted suicide on moral or religious grounds.
Conservatives believe the First Amendment clearly protects people from being forced to violate their own religious beliefs on issues like abortion.
""Just today we finalized new protections of conscience rights for physicians, pharmacists, nurses, teachers, students and faith-based charities,"" Trump announced in the White House Rose Garden. ""They've been wanting to do that for a long time.""
Liberals like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are furious, calling the religious freedom protections ""bigoted"" and ""immoral."" She added, ""This is an open license to discriminate against Americans.""
The city of San Francisco immediately sued to block the conscience regulation.
Roger Severino, head of the office that will enforce it at the Department of Health and Human Services, said no one should ""have to shed their religious beliefs to participate in health care."" He added that ""certain medical professions such as OB-GYN should not be declared pro-life-free zones.""
HHS received more than 1,300 complaints last year that health care workers faced discrimination for their religious beliefs or conscience issues.
Alliance Defending Freedom Legal Counsel Kellie Fiedorek said this new regulation is vitally important. ""One of the freedoms Americans have cherished most is the freedom to live according to their faith and conscience, free from government coercion. Unfortunately, ADF clients and other nurses, doctors, and health care providers have faced discrimination and even have lost their jobs because of their commitment to saving life.""
Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) applauded the move saying, ""I'm grateful that HHS is taking meaningful action to protect the conscience rights of all Americans. Health care should be about saving life, not taking life. Health care providers should never be forced or coerced into participating in abortion. The Office for Civil Rights is now better empowered to protect individuals from having their moral convictions about the sanctity of human life violated.""
Family Research Council leader Tony Perkins also praised Trump's move saying, ""Protecting the right of all health care providers to make professional judgments based on moral convictions and ethical standards ... is necessary to ensure that access to health care is not diminished, which would occur if they were forced out of their jobs because of their ethical stances.""

Makers of 'Unplanned' Release 'Planned from the Start' Devotional to Help Post-Abortive Women Heal,www1.cbn.com,,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/makers-of-unplanned-release-planned-from-the-start-devotional-to-help-post-abortive-women-heal,"Makers of 'Unplanned' Release 'Planned from the Start' Devotional to Help Post-Abortive Women Heal
The pro-life film ""Unplanned"" scored big at the box office, with millions of faithful followers.
With only a $6 million budget, the PureFlix film started making a profit on its opening weekend after debuting with $6.1 million, eventually earning more than $17.7 million overall.
It tells the true story of Abby Johnson's transformation from Planned Parenthood clinic director to pro-life advocate. Johnson's compelling story has opened up the hearts and minds of thousands of people who have seen the movie.
Last month, Chuck Konzelman, director of the PureFlix movie revealed to Congress that nearly 100 abortion clinic workers have sought to leave their jobs after seeing the pro-life film. The film's makers have now released a companion devotional called "" Planned from the Start ,"" to help former workers and other women heal from the pain of abortion.
The website for the film describes the book saying, ""Planned from the Start: A Healing Devotional reveals five core areas of emotional turmoil often faced following abortion and brings healing to those who are hurting—healing to the emotions which trap women and men in the prison of pain that abortion has brought into their lives, and into the lives of those who love them.""
Author Lorraine Varela was tapped to write the book.
""My husband and I – Gabriel – were on the set of 'Unplanned' as their prayer warriors as part of their prayer team, and as we came back from filming we spoke with Cary Solomon and Chuck Konzelman, our directors, and they invited me to write a healing devotional because we saw so many testimonies come forward while we were on set,"" Varela said in an interview with CBN News.
""They knew that they had to offer a resource to women and men who had been affected by abortion, who would have some feelings and some emotions stirred up as a result of seeing the film. And they wanted to provide support for them.""
She explained the reason for the devotional's title ""Planned from the Start.""
""'Unplanned' has somewhat of a connotation that things happen outside of our control and 'Planned from the Start' just tells us that God had a plan and a purpose before we were even born,"" she said. ""And one of the things I heard from so many who had gone through abortion as I was writing this devotional was, they felt disconnected from the plan and purposes of God, and there's nothing we can do that will separate us from His love. And we wanted this book to be a connector of hearts back to the purposes of God and to His heart.""
Varela said the devotional outlines five key areas that both women and men face following abortion: guilt, grief, shame, regret and depression.
""Those are the areas we know we don't want people to stay in a place of grief,"" she said. ""The Lord wants to take your grief and bring it to joy and so for each of those areas of emotional pain, the Lord has healing in the opposite spirit. He has forgiveness for guilt, and He has grace over shame and so forth.""
She is hopeful that the devotional will help many on their journey to forgiveness, healing and wholeness.
""First, I hope that it takes off shame,"" said Varela. ""I think what we've heard is that there have been women that have been living with their emotional pain of abortion for decades. And they have not had that ability to address their pain because, for one, our culture says they didn't do anything wrong... that having the abortion was like the same thing as going into a procedure at a dental office. It's no big deal.""
She added, ""Yet they've known that they have caused the loss of a life and they've carried this guilt and they've had no way to express that because culture hasn't allowed them to.""
""So, the first that we hope we can do through this book is just lift the shame off what's taken place in their life so they can start the healing process,"" Varela said."

"As Barr Battles Dems, a Shocking New Report: FBI Sent Undercover Agent to Track Trump Team in 2016",www.cbn.com,Jennifer Wishon *,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/may/as-barr-battles-dems-a-shocking-new-report-fbi-sent-undercover-agent-to-track-trump-team-in-2016,"WASHINGTON - We know now the FBI assigned an undercover agent to observe the Trump campaign in 2016.
The New York Times reports an FBI investigator, described as an attractive blonde woman, using the name Azra Turk, posed as a research assistant to observe Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos.
The revelation shows the lengths the FBI took to find out if the Trump campaign was aiding Russia in its election meddling scheme and gives fuel to the president's claims his campaign was spied on.
During his Senate testimony Wednesday, Attorney General William Barr said he's assigned a team at the Justice Department to help him review the origins of the Trump-Russia probe.
Meanwhile, Democrats are fuming after Barr refused to testify before the House Judiciary Committee Thursday. He made that decision after learning committee attorneys, rather than members of Congress, would be questioning him.
When Barr didn't show, Congressman Steve Cohen brought in a ceramic chicken and a bucket of KFC, then proceeded to eat the fried chicken from the dais.
He drew attention and laughs, but not everyone was laughing. The committee chairman is threatening to hold Barr in contempt.
""We can't have him or anybody in the administration dictate the manner in which we function,"" House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) told his committee.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) says Barr lied about his dialogue with the Mueller team.
""The attorney general of the United States was not telling the truth to the Congress. That's a crime,"" the speaker told reporters during her weekly press conference.
The Justice Department calls Pelosi's accusation, ""reckless, irresponsible and false.""
However, it's not just Barr the Democrats are targeting. Chairman Nadler and others want to hear from a number of key witnesses in the Mueller report like former White House counsel Dan McGahn, but President Trump is reserving the presidential right of executive privilege to block their testimony.
The president says he completely cooperated with Mueller's team and the investigation should be over.
In an interview with Fox News Thursday, the president said, ""I would say, it's done.""
The Trump administration calls the Mueller report the final word while Democrats see it as a new starting point."
"'Our Hopes in the Hand of Our Creator': Trump on Synagogue Attack, Venezuela, Religious Freedom",www.cbn.com,Ben Kennedy,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/may/our-hopes-in-the-hand-of-our-creator-trump-on-synagogue-attack-venezuela-religious-freedom,"WASHINGTON – On Thursday the country came together simply to pray. The National Day of Prayer is held on the first Thursday of May each year, and people of all faiths came together at the White House to pray.
""On this day of prayer we once again place our hopes in the hand of our Creator,"" Trump said.
The National Day of Prayer kicked off in the Rose Garden with a call for Americans to follow 'The Golden Rule.'
This year's theme was ""Love One Another"", designed with the goal of putting aside politics for prayer.
""As we unite on this day of prayer, we renew our resolve to protect communities of faith and to ensure that all people can live, pray and worship in peace,"" said Trump.
President Trump said prayer is needed now more than ever in the wake of attacks on places of worship.
Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein spoke out after getting wounded during a shooting at a synagogue near San Diego.
""Mister President when you called me, I was at home, weeping,"" Goldstein said. ""You were the first person who began my healing.""
The Commander-in-Chief then prayed for healing in Venezuela where tensions have reached a boiling point.
More protestors are expected there as opposition leader Juan Guaido renewed his calls this week for the overthrow of dictator Nicolas Maduro.
""The brutal repression of Venezuelan people must end,"" Trump said.
""The Bible says pray for all those who are in authority and that's a long prayer list,"" Pastor Jack Graham said.
Pastor Graham is on the President's Faith Advisory Council.
He told CBN News they met Wednesday about mobilizing Christians to help with the humanitarian crisis at the border and tasking churches to help revitalize cities through economic development.
""These are urgent times and we need to pray not just 'easy does it' prayers but we need to pray with compassion and passion,"" Graham said.
President Trump also showcased new faith-based protections for healthcare workers as well as faith-based adoption.
He also touted how federal employees can now take paid time off to observe religious holidays."

High School May Remove George Washington Mural that 'Traumatizes Students and Community Members',www.cbn.com,Mark Martin,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/high-school-may-remove-george-washington-mural-that-traumatizes-students-and-community-members,"A mural depicting the ""Life of Washington"" on the walls of George Washington High School in San Francisco may be removed, following the recommendation of a working group.
The San Francisco Unified School District may take down the 13-panel mural because of concerns it offends and demeans Native Americans and African Americans.
""SFUSD convened a 'Reflection and Action Working Group' that was comprised of members of the local Native American community, students, school representatives, district representatives, local artists and historians,"" a spokeswoman for the district, Laura Dudnick, told The College Fix .
The group, which met in recent months, decided the mural ""traumatizes students and community members.""
""At its conclusion the group voted and the majority recommended that the 'Life of Washington' mural be archived and removed because the mural does not represent SFUSD values,"" Dudnick continued.
Victor Arnautoff, a Russian American painter and professor of art, helped paint the mural 83 years ago, according to the Richmond District Blog . The Richmond District is a neighborhood of San Francisco. The Works Progress Administration funded the project as part of the New Deal.
Advocates who want to keep the mural on the walls say the recommendation by the working group ignores the artist's intention and is an effort to erase history.
Historian Fergus M. Bordewich wrote in the The Wall Street Journal , ""A San Francisco mural has become the latest high-profile target of self-appointed censors who want to erase both history and art of which they disapprove.""
""The mural's painter, Victor Arnautoff, was a protégé of Diego Rivera and a communist,"" Bordewich wrote. ""He included those images not to glorify Washington, but rather to provoke a nuanced evaluation of his legacy.""
Bordewich also issued a statement to CBN News about the mural:
""The activists and bureaucrats who are determined to remove or destroy an artistically superb and historically accurate set of 1930s murals presenting the life of George Washington are guilty not only of embracing willful censorship but they are also astonishingly ignorant of the history they want to suppress. The claim that the murals somehow celebrate African-American slavery and the genocide of Native Americans is absurd. In his will, Washington freed every slave he owned and provided for them financially. And he advocated an exceptionally enlightened policy toward native tribes. The artist also, by the way, presented enslaved people and Native Americans not in any degraded or demeaning way but as people of both strength and dignity. There's nothing wrong with debating the meaning of our national history, but those who challenge it ought to at least get their facts right.""
Bordewich told The Fix there ""is a deeply wrongheaded habit to project today's norms, values, ideals backwards in time to find our ancestors inevitably falling short.""
Dudnick says the mural could stay on the walls of George Washington High School, however. She said the superintendent and staff are now looking over the working group's recommendation and considering what should be done with the artwork.
CBN News reached out to the San Francisco Unified School District for comment. At the time of publication, the district had not yet responded to our inquiry."
"'An Islamist War Against Jesus': How This Imam Is Fighting Radical Islam to Build Peace with Christians, Jews",www.cbn.com,George Thomas,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/an-islamist-war-against-jesus-how-this-imam-is-fighting-radical-islam-to-build-peace-with-christians-jews,"Muslim author Mohammad Tawhidi tells CBN News' Sr. International Correspondent George Thomas that America must do more to challenge countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran for their support and funding of Islamic extremism.
Mohammad Tawhidi calls himself an ""Imam of peace"" and is urging fellow-Muslims to support Christians and other people of faith who routinely suffer for their beliefs.
""We are all brothers in humanity before brothers in faith,"" Tawhidi told CBN News .
Tawhidi is a third-generation Iranian-born Muslim from Australia and author of The Tragedy of Islam.
He uses his Twitter and Facebook accounts to warn the world about the growing dangers of radical Islam.
""If Christians don't wake up, if Christians leaders don't wake up, then we Muslims who fled from extremists can't help you anymore,"" Tawhidi told CBN News in an interview . ""We tried warning you.""
Tawhidi says out-of-control multiculturalism and political correctness are allowing radical Muslims with their dangerous and deadly ideology, to flourish.
""When we come to the West and try to warn the governments and intelligence agencies about what is happening, about the people we fled from, we have this new political correctness agenda that tells us that 'oh, we are the racists, we are the ones who are traitors and the extremists need to be understood and embraced'.""
This week, he was in Canada taking part in ceremonies commemorating the Holocaust.
I flew to Toronto to light the candles of #YomHashoah2019 , with over 20 faith leaders, at the first multi-faith commemoration of the Holocaust. May the rest of the world stand in solidarity with the Jewish People. Thank you to the @CanadianFSWC on this historical achievement. pic.twitter.com/bRkrgpTrIS

""I flew to Toronto to light the candles of #YomHashoah2019, with over 20 faith leaders, at the first multi-faith commemoration of the Holocaust,"" Tawhidi wrote on Twitter. ""May the rest of the world stand in solidarity with the Jewish People.""
This is rather a remarkable transformation for a Muslim who reportedly just a few short years ago had very different view of Jews.
""Five years ago, I used to curse them,"" Tahwidi admitted. ""Today I am standing in solidarity with them.""
Dov Hikind, former New York state assemblyman and a Jewish American, recently wrote about Tawhidi saying: ""I'm proud to call @Imamofpeace Imam Tawhidi a personal friend as well as a friend of the Jewish people and an advocate for a peaceful humanity. He's someone who has well internalized the lessons of #neveragain and has much to teach people from all faiths and backgrounds.""
Tawhidi responded, writing : ""You are Jewish, and I am Muslim. We are on the same path, just on different lanes. Side by side we will take on the enemies of humanity.""
As you can imagine, fellow-Muslims have ridiculed him for building relations with Christians and Jews.
""My friends asked why I changed teams?"" Tawhidi asked rhetorically on Twitter recently. ""As though they didn't know why,"" he retorted.
""For many years we have been lied to {that} 'the Jews are the enemy, kill them.' And I do not want to be in a position where I have to 'kill Jews, or shoot their children; even in a laser tag game,"" he wrote on Twitter.
And now he's coming to the defense of Christians who are being persecuted in unprecedented numbers around the world.
""We are all human beings,"" Tawhidi told CBN News . ""If I don't side with you against ISIS that wants to kill both of us, then what is my purpose in life.""
Shortly after the Islamic terror attacks in Sri Lanka, Tawhidi tweeted , ""If you are silent about #SriLankaAttacks, know that this is an Islamist war against Jesus. Pick a side. I am standing with Jesus.""

Looking back, Tawhidi says he's horrified at how his Muslim faith has treated people of other religions.
""When I was 12, our fledgling Muslim community in Australia bought a Church and converted it into a Mosque,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""The Imam gathered us all to wash the inside of the building with running water to purify it from the 'impurities of the Christians.' I was scrubbing all night. How pathetic.""

Tawhidi applauded President Trump this week when his administration announced plans to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terror organization. Such a designation would make the Muslim Brotherhood and its partners vulnerable to harsh economic and travel sanctions imposed by the US.
""The Muslim Brotherhood is the most organized extremist terrorist organization on this planet,"" Tawhidi told CBN News . ""Yes, I do support {the decision} and more power to President Trump.""

Makers of 'Unplanned' Release 'Planned from the Start' Devotional to Help Post-Abortive Women Heal,www.cbn.com,Charlene Aaron,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/makers-of-unplanned-release-planned-from-the-start-devotional-to-help-post-abortive-women-heal,"The pro-life film ""Unplanned"" scored big at the box office, with millions of faithful followers.
With only a $6 million budget, the PureFlix film started making a profit on its opening weekend after debuting with $6.1 million, eventually earning more than $17.7 million overall.
It tells the true story of Abby Johnson's transformation from Planned Parenthood clinic director to pro-life advocate.
Johnson's compelling story has opened up the hearts and minds of thousands of people who have seen the movie.
Last month, Chuck Konzelman, director of the PureFlix movie revealed to Congress that nearly 100 abortion clinic workers have sought to leave their jobs after seeing the pro-life film.
The film's makers have now released a companion devotional called "" Planned from the Start ,"" to help former workers and other women heal from the pain of abortion.
The website for the film describes the book saying, ""Planned from the Start: A Healing Devotional reveals five core areas of emotional turmoil often faced following abortion and brings healing to those who are hurting—healing to the emotions which trap women and men in the prison of pain that abortion has brought into their lives, and into the lives of those who love them.""
Author Lorraine Varela was tapped to write the book.
""My husband and I – Gabriel – were on the set of 'Unplanned' as their prayer warriors as part of their prayer team, and as we came back from filming we spoke with Cary Solomon and Chuck Konzelman, our directors, and they invited me to write a healing devotional because we saw so many testimonies come forward while we were on set,"" Varela said in an interview with CBN News.
""They knew that they had to offer a resource to women and men who had been affected by abortion, who would have some feelings and some emotions stirred up as a result of seeing the film. And they wanted to provide support for them.""
She explained the reason for the devotional's title ""Planned from the Start.""
""'Unplanned' has somewhat of a connotation that things happen outside of our control and 'Planned from the Start' just tells us that God had a plan and a purpose before we were even born,"" she said. ""And one of the things I heard from so many who had gone through abortion as I was writing this devotional was, they felt disconnected from the plan and purposes of God, and there's nothing we can do that will separate us from His love. And we wanted this book to be a connector of hearts back to the purposes of God and to His heart.""
Varela said the devotional outlines five key areas that both women and men face following abortion: guilt, grief, shame, regret and depression.
""Those are the areas we know we don't want people to stay in a place of grief,"" she said. ""The Lord wants to take your grief and bring it to joy and so for each of those areas of emotional pain, the Lord has healing in the opposite spirit. He has forgiveness for guilt, and He has grace over shame and so forth.""
She is hopeful that the devotional will help many on their journey to forgiveness, healing and wholeness.
""First, I hope that it takes off shame,"" said Varela. ""I think what we've heard is that there have been women that have been living with their emotional pain of abortion for decades. And they have not had that ability to address their pain because, for one, our culture says they didn't do anything wrong... that having the abortion was like the same thing as going into a procedure at a dental office. It's no big deal.""
She added, ""Yet they've known that they have caused the loss of a life and they've carried this guilt and they've had no way to express that because culture hasn't allowed them to.""
""So, the first that we hope we can do through this book is just lift the shame off what's taken place in their life so they can start the healing process,"" Varela said."
NKorean Defector Details Persecution and False Religion of Kim's Regime: 'They Are Not Gods... There Is a Real God',www.cbn.com,Charlene Aaron,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/nkorean-defector-details-persecution-and-false-religion-of-kims-regime-they-are-not-gods-there-is-a-real-god,"North Korea is known as one of the most dangerous places on earth to be a Christian.
Choi Jeong-hun is a former member of the North Korean military but defected in December of 2016.
He is currently visiting the United States for what's known as the North Korean Freedom Week, an event held each year for the liberation and free unification of North Koreans.
""I come from North Korea and China border area in Yangang Province,"" Jeong-hun told CBN News via a translator. ""In 1988, I was enlisted to the North Korean military. In '94 I was in Mirim military academy. In 1997, I became a lieutenant.""
Jeong-hun is also a Christian.
As a member of the North Korean military, he shared how he had witnessed the execution of high-ranking military officials at the hands of Kim Jong Un's brutal regime.
""If you criticize them or these kind people, those who were not compliant, regardless of who they are, they are getting execution or they get harshly penalized,"" said Jeong-hun.
He went on to say, ""For example, just like Jang Song-thaek, who was his uncle, he was using a machine gun to kill his uncle. In North Korea, only the direction of Kim Jong Un, they regard it as this is the order that comes from god. Therefore, so if you are not compliant to his directives or if you criticized them, then there is merciless - they go to concentration camps or were executed. I have seen firsthand and I have also seen all these people who experienced this.""
Jeong-hun also explained the false religious beliefs of the North Korean dictator.
""Kim Jong Un has his own sort of religion and he cripples the people mentally in North Korea,"" he said. ""The people who lived as a Christian, when Kim Jong Un, when he took the leadership of North Korea, they were mostly executed.""
He added that many Christians who escaped execution, went on to spread the gospel, including himself.
""Me, after I defected, to the North Korean people I am showing them that Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un, they are not gods and to show them there is a real God and also to renew the things that they know in North Korea that these are wrong.""
Jeong-hun arrived in South Korea in 2006 and now works to secretly spread the gospel of Jesus Christ and the word of God to believers inside North Korea via flash drives, memory sticks and other technology.
Possessing a Bible in North Korea could get you 15 years of hard labor in a prison camp, or worse.
Yet Jeong-hun says the mission must go on.
""We are spreading them inside North Korea,"" said Jeong-hun."
BOOM: Unemployment Hits 49-Year Low as US Employers Step up Hiring,www.cbn.com,Associated Press,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/may/boom-unemployment-hits-49-year-low-as-us-employers-step-up-hiring,"WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. employers added a robust 263,000 jobs in April, suggesting that businesses have shrugged off earlier concerns that the economy might slow this year and now anticipate strong customer demand.
The unemployment rate fell to a five-decade low of 3.6% from 3.8%, though that drop partly reflected an increase in the number of Americans who stopped looking for work. Average hourly pay rose 3.2% from 12 months earlier, a healthy increase though unchanged from the previous month.
Friday's jobs report from the Labor Department showed that solid economic growth is still encouraging strong hiring nearly a decade into the economy's recovery from the Great Recession. The economic expansion is set to become the longest in history in July.
Many businesses say they're struggling to find workers, yet each month they seem to add a substantial number. Some have taken a range of steps to fill jobs, including training more entry-level workers, loosening educational requirements and raising pay sharply.
Years of steady hiring have sharply lowered unemployment for a range of population groups. The unemployment rate for women fell last month to 3.1%, the lowest point since 1953. The rate for Latinos dropped to 4.2%, a record low since 1973, when the government began tracking the data.
For Asians, joblessness has matched a record low of 2.2%. And the unemployment rate for veterans of the Iraq and Afghan wars dropped to 1.7%, also a record low.
Most of last month's job growth occurred in services, which includes both higher-paying jobs in information technology and lower-paying temporary work. Manufacturers added just 4,000 jobs. Construction firms gained 33,000, mostly on public infrastructure projects.
Professional and business services, which include IT networking jobs as well as accountants and engineers, led the gains with 76,000. Education and health care added 62,000 jobs, while a category that mostly includes restaurants and hotels gained 34,000.
The brightening picture represents a sharp improvement from the start of the year. At the time, the government was enduring a partial shutdown, the stock market had plunged, trade tensions between the United States and China were flaring and the Federal Reserve had just raised short-term interest rates in December for a fourth time in 2018. Analysts worried that the economy might barely expand in the first three months of the year.
Yet the outlook soon brightened. Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the Fed would put rate hikes on hold. Trade negotiations between the U.S. and China made some progress. The economic outlook in some other major economies improved. Share prices rebounded.
And in the end, the government reported that the U.S. economy grew at a 3.2% annual rate in the January-March period - the strongest pace for a first quarter since 2015. That said, the growth was led mostly by factors that could prove temporary - a restocking of inventories in warehouses and on store shelves and a narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit. By contrast, consumer spending and business investment, which more closely reflect the economy's underlying strength, were relatively weak.
But American households have become more confident since the winter and are ramping up spending. Consumer spending surged in March by the most in nearly a decade. A likely factor is that steady job growth and solid wage increases have enlarged Americans' paychecks.
Businesses are also spending more freely. Orders to U.S. factories for long-lasting capital goods jumped in March by the most in eight months. That suggested that companies were buying more computers, machinery and other equipment to keep up with growing customer demand.
Housing, too, is rebounding after home sales had slumped in the second half of last year. Mortgage rates rose to nearly 5% last fall as the Fed raised interest rates. With the Fed now putting rate hikes on hold, borrowing costs have declined.
In February, sales of existing homes jumped by the most in three years. And in March, more Americans signed contracts to buy a house. Contract signings usually lead to finished sales one to two months later.

The Top 200 Healthiest Foods and Why It's More Important Than Ever to Eat Them | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/may/the-top-200-healthiest-foods-and-why-its-more-important-than-ever-to-eat-them,"The Top 200 Healthiest Foods and Why It's More Important Than Ever to Eat Them
When we think about life's biggest decisions, images of choosing the right spouse, career or home come to mind. What to eat? Not so much.
New research may change that. Scientists now know our body has five natural defense systems that are magnificently effective at warding off our scariest diseases. There is a catch, however. These defense systems only work properly when nourished with healthy foods.
In his new book Eat to Beat Disease Dr. William Li explains how our body's defense systems work and lists 200 foods that keep them humming.
""We don't need to spend all of our time thinking about what to cut out of our diet,"" he told CBN News, ""It's now time to start thinking about what we can add to our lives,"" adding, ""we want to eat lots of foods that can activate our health defenses and because there are so many choices and everybody can find something they like in the 200 foods that I list, you can start eating healthy with the foods you already love.""
Readers will be thrilled to discover delicious sourdough and pumpernickel bread actually feed one of our health defense systems, as do certain cheeses. Many foods, called ""grand slams"" fuel all five defense systems.
Angiogenesis
This health defense system keeps cancers small. Believe it or not, we all have cancer cells within our body, but angiogenesis is a form of protection that starves those cancer cells and prevents them from growing and invading the rest of our body. Angiogenesis regulates our blood vessels. More than 100 foods can enhance angiogenesis such as pomegranate, black raspberries, and tomatoes. Dr. Li takes it a step further by pointing out that when it comes to tomatoes, cooked, San Marzano contains the most cancer-fighting lycopene.
""Almost 36,000 men have been studied,"" he said, ""And it was found that those who ate two to three servings of cooked tomatoes, that's tomato sauce, a week, had a thirty percent decreased risk of developing prostate cancer.""
Vitamin K-2 is key to controlling angiogenesis, you can find this vitamin in Gouda, Jarlesburg, and Edam
""This vitamin K2, which is a healthy side effect of making the cheese itself, is a powerful anti-angiogenic, cancer starving substance,"" said Dr. Li.
Microbiome
It may sound a little gross, but trillions of living bacteria call our intestinal tract home. Not only that, but we rely heavily on these microscopic critters to keep every aspect of our minds and bodies operating smoothly. The kind of bacteria and the amount of them comprise a very complex ecosystem called our microbiome. Dr. Li says a balanced microbiome leads to good physical and mental health.
""The healthy bacteria that live inside our bodies, 39 trillion bacteria live inside us, communicate with our immune system. They help our bodies heal. They even talk to our brain.""
Dr. Li says fermented foods like Kim Chi and yogurt contain healthy bacteria, also known as probiotics. Fiber-rich foods like broccoli, which are called prebiotics, play a role because they feed the good bacteria. Some people are surprised to learn sourdough bread boosts our microbiome.
""It turns out that sourdough is made with Lactobacillus reuteri. It's that bacteria that creates that nice tangy taste,"" he explained, ""That bacteria boosts our immune system, it can actually speed our healing, our ability to heal wounds and it also communicates to our brains to release that social hormone oxytocin that makes us feel good.""
Pumpernickel bread, which is made from rye flour, also fortifies the microbiome. ""Rye flour will decrease the levels of an unhealthy bacteria in our gut that creates a toxin that causes inflammation,"" he said, ""So eating pumpernickel bread can lower that bacteria and lower inflammation.""

DNA Repair
We all know DNA contains the genetic code we inherited from our parents. However, it's much more than that. It issues commands to our entire body, telling it what to do. Unfortunately, it's a fragile system that is constantly under attack from the environment. Natural enemies such as ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure can weaken DNA, as can toxins such as second-hand smoke and gasoline fumes. (Dr. Li recommends standing down-wind of these fumes when filling our cars).
Foods that repair and strengthen our DNA include kiwifruit, spinach, and lentils. Get this: over 100 different types of oysters strengthen DNA, particularly Pacific oysters. In one study, the oysters reduced DNA damage by a whopping 90 percent!
Stem Cells
Only recently have scientists uncovered the protective properties of our own stem cells, which are vital for growing and maintaining our organs. Researchers now tell us these foundational life units can actually regenerate our bodies throughout our lives.
""When we were kids we were taught salamanders and starfish regenerate, but people can't,"" Dr. Li said, ""Science is turning that upside down. We know that we do regenerate from the inside out using our stem cells.""
As if we need another reason to love chocolate, recent studies show the dark bean can be a super fuel for stem cells.
""And I write about in my book about a study with men who have coronary disease,"" Dr. Li explained, ""And when they were given dark cocoa, the chocolate alone was able to double the number of stem cells in their bloodstream, and when they measured their blood flow they were able to double that as well. So it's quite remarkable.""
Immune System
Our immune system is one of the most well-known health defense systems, yet scientists continue to learn more about how it works. It keeps us from getting an infection after we've been exposed to bacteria, fights off viruses and more. In short, a strong immune system provides protection against any pathogen seeking to harm us.
""We now know the immune system is more powerful than we ever thought,"" said Dr. Li, ""In fact, it can protect us against cancer.""
In addition to cancer, dozens of other conditions can be blamed on weak immune systems such as allergies, Celiac Disease, Psoriasis, even Diabetes.
Foods that stimulate the immune system include mushroom, garlic, and particularly extra virgin olive oil.
""There's actually a natural substance in the olive called hydroxytyrosol which is a powerful way to cut off the blood supply feeding cancer,"" said Dr. Li, ""It's also anti-inflammatory.""
Dr. Li says certain olive oils contain more of the healing hydroxytyrosol and polyphenols than others. He recommends buying olive oil made from Koroneiki, Picual or Moraiolo olives.
""So when I go shopping for olive oil,"" Dr. Li said, ""I pick up the bottle, and I turn it around, and I look for the name of the olive. What kind of olive was this oil pressed from?""
So while many of view food as an afterthought, Dr. William Li says putting a little thought into what we eat can pay dividends when it comes to our health.
""While medicines can be used to treat disease, foods can prevent it in the first place,"" he said. "
"Muslim Tells Christians: 'We Tried Warning You,' It's Time to 'Wake Up' about Threat of Radical Islam | CBN News",www1.cbn.com,George Thomas *,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/may/muslim-tells-christians-we-tried-warning-you-its-time-to-wake-up-about-threat-of-radical-islam,"Courtesy: Imam Tawhidi Facebook 6032324813001 Muslim Tells Christians: 'We Tried Warning You,' It's Time to 'Wake Up' about Threat of Radical Islam Muslim author Mohammad Tawhidi shares with CBN News' Sr. International Correspondent George Thomas how America can fight against the threat of radical Islam.
As Sri Lankan authorities worry about the potential of more suicide attacks by the group behind the Easter Sunday bombings, one Muslim activist is issuing an urgent warning to Christians around the world about the growing and very real threat of radical Islam.
""If Christians don't wake up, if Christians leaders don't wake up, then we Muslims who fled from extremists can't help you anymore,"" said Mohammad Tawhidi , a Muslim author from Australia. ""We tried warning you.""
Tawhidi, a third-generation Iranian-born Muslim and author of The Tragedy of Islam , says political correctness is allowing radical Muslims with their dangerous and deadly ideology, to flourish.
""When we come to the West and try to warn the governments and intelligence agencies about what is happening, about the people we fled from, we have this new political correctness agenda that tells us that 'oh, we are the racists, we are the ones who are traitors and the extremists need to be understood and embraced'.""
Tawhidi says even though the Islamic terror group ISIS lost its territory in Syria and Iraq, the group's followers and sympathizers are still actively planning mayhem.
""We are fighting a real caliphate, not a so-called caliphate, this is the true extremist Islamist militant ideology that is taking over our lands and our countries,"" Tawhidi warned.
This week, a German newspaper published an exhaustive study of all Islamic terror attacks around the world since the September 11, 2001, strikes on America.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt Islamic extremists have carried out 31,211 attacks in the last 18 years.
Those attacks have killed 146,811 people around the world. Most of the victims have been Muslims.
The newspaper analyzed all the information gathered by the Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland to come up with the number of attacks and lives lost.
The list concludes with the recent attacks in Sri Lanka that killed at least 253 people and injured more than 500 when suicide bombers targeted churches and hotels on the island nation.
Tawhidi, who describes himself on his website as ""Muslim scholar, thinker and educator,"" says he's on a mission to tackle the ""spread of Islamic extremism"" and believes the key is to reform Muslim societies and their mindset.
""Look, I'm a Muslim, but I cannot live in an Islamist theocracy,"" Tawhidi told CBN News . ""I can live in a Christian government, based on their constitution, because that is where peace lies. I cannot live in a place where ISIS rules the area.""
""No Muslim with a brain that works would want to live under ISIS,"" Tawhidi added.

Once there was a minister who was lonely, depressed and feeling defeated in his life and ministry. One night in his despair, he found himself in a bar on the seedy side of town. With his head bowed low in shame, he walked across the dimly lit room and took a seat at the bar. He sat staring into his drink, a drink he had never had before, and pondered his life and his failures.
Suddenly, a man sitting two seats to his right, a man who had obviously been drinking heavily, turned to him, looked at him with piercing eyes and said, “What are you doing here?”
The minister was shocked and thought to himself, “Do I know this man? Does he know me? All the while the man stared at him with those piercing eyes awaiting an answer. An answer he already knew. This minister did not belong there.
Immediately, he rose from the bar stool and left the building. As he sat behind the wheel of his car he thought to himself, “Lord, what has brought me to this low point in my life?” It was as if the Lord had spoken through that man.
As he pulled out of the parking lot he asked for forgiveness. In his beaten and defeated condition, he went back to his home, to his family, and to his ministry. Ashamed of himself, he put one foot in front of the other, and went through the motions, feeling unworthy yet determined to try again. The Lord restored him and he continued his ministry.
There was a man in the Bible, a prophet named Elijah, who also reached a point in his life when he felt defeated and wanted to give up.
“Elijah was afraid and fled for his life. He went to Beersheba, a town in Judah, and he left his servant there. Then he went on alone into the wilderness, traveling all day. He sat down under a solitary broom tree and prayed that he might die. 'I have had enough, Lord,' he said. 'Take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors who have already died.'” 1 Kings 19:3-4 (NLT)
“But the Lord said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
Elijah replied, “I have zealously served the Lord God Almighty. But the people of Israel have broken their covenant with you, torn down your altars, and killed every one of your prophets. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me, too.” 1 Kings 19:9-10 (NLT)
Even the great prophet Elijah reached a point in his life when he felt so defeated that he just wanted to die. The Lord asked him again ""What are you doing here Elijah?” Then he was given instructions on what to do next.
There may be a time in your life when you were brought low, a time that only you and the Lord know about. Do not let that define you. Do not let that set your course for a lifetime of defeat. Instead, put one foot in front of the other — and though you feel unworthy, determine in your heart to try again. The Lord will hold you up with his strong right arm. He will set your course and make straight your path. Defeat will humble a person, but with the help of the Lord, there is hope, restoration, and a victorious future.

How Israel Stopped Syria from Becoming a Global Nuclear Nightmare - CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/may/how-israel-stopped-syria-from-becoming-a-global-nuclear-nightmare,"How Israel Stopped Syria from Becoming a Global Nuclear Nightmare
On September 6, 2007, shortly after midnight, Israeli fighters advanced on Deir ez-Zour in Syria. Israel often flew into Syria as a warning to President Bashar al-Assad. But this time, there was no warning and no explanation. This was a covert operation, with one goal: to destroy a nuclear reactor being built by North Korea under a tight veil of secrecy in the Syrian desert. Gordon Robertson talks with Yaakov Katz about his new book, Shadow Strike , on Friday's 700 Club.
Shadow Strike tells, for the first time, the story of the espionage, political courage, military might and psychological warfare behind Israel's daring operation to stop one of the greatest known acts of nuclear proliferation. It also brings Israel's powerful military and diplomatic alliance with the United States to life, revealing the debates President Bush had with Vice President Cheney and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert as well as the diplomatic and military planning that took place in the Oval Office, the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, and inside the IDF's underground war room beneath Tel Aviv.
These two countries remain united in a battle to prevent nuclear proliferation, to defeat Islamic terror, and to curtail Iran's attempts to spread its hegemony throughout the Middle East. Yaakov Katz's Shadow Strike explores how this operation continues to impact the world we live in today and if what happened in 2007 is a sign of what Israel will need to do one day to stop Iran's nuclear program. It also asks: had Israel not carried out this mission, what would the Middle East look like today?"

On Saturday, Focus on the Family presented what had been billed as the largest pro-life event ever held in New York City's Times Square.
The event called ""Alive from New York"" was designed to celebrate the sanctity of human life, marvel at the wonder of human development in the womb, and encourage advocacy for women facing unplanned pregnancies and the preborn.
The move was launched in response to New York state's radical new abortion law that allows abortion of viable babies right up until the moment of birth.
Thousands of people showed up to witness the event, which featured live music and inspirational speeches from special guests, as well as abortion survivors. The highlight of the event was a live 4D ultrasound presented on massive digital screens in Times Square.

Israel's KAN television reported one woman was seriously injured in the head from shrapnel from a rocket.

'A Good Starting Point': Jared Kushner Says New Middle East Peace Plan Recognizes Ages-Old Challenges,www1.cbn.com,,05-04-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/may/a-good-starting-point-jared-kushner-says-new-middle-east-peace-plan-recognizes-ages-old-challenges,"Presidential adviser Jared Kushner. (AP Photo) 6032923080001 'A Good Starting Point': Jared Kushner Says New Middle East Peace Plan Recognizes Ages-Old Challenges
The long-awaited Middle East peace plan is taking shape.
President Donald Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner just gave a glimpse of their recommendations to help end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Kushner says the ""detailed"" plan addresses core issues of the age-old dispute. The president's senior adviser said President Trump himself was ""hands on"" and that ""people will be surprised with what is in"" the proposal. Kushner said the plan could lead to a breakthrough in Middle East peace.
""What we will be able to put together is a solution that we believe is a good starting point,"" he said.
That starting point aims to get both the Israeli's and Palestinians to talk to each other.
""What I see in the region is that the big divide now is you have leaders that are trying to empower their people and create more opportunity for them to have a better life,"" Kushner noted. ""And then you have leaders that are trying to repress their people and often using religion and other excuses as a reason to try and hold their people down.""
While Kushner calls proposal ""detailed""– it's unclear if any of those details include anything resembling a two-state solution.
""What we want to do is put something out that we think is based on logic where unquestionably we can say that this will lead to the Palestinian people living a much better life,"" he added.
The challenge lies with connecting to Palestinian Authority leaders who cut off diplomatic ties after President Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
""We see this as Israel is a special country,"" Kushner said. ""It's the only democracy in the region. It's America's strongest ally.""
And as its strongest ally – their security in the deal is a top priority.
""I don't think anyone will question if we do ask Israel to make compromises in our proposal that we're going to ask them to do things that would put them at risk security wise,"" the president's adviser said. ""I don't think the president would take decisions himself that he would think would put America and the people who he represents at risk and wouldn't expect another leader to do that.""
Kushner says the plan offers the Palestinians positive business solutions with economic incentives.
""When we looked at the Palestinians, we said well what are the opportunities that they can have,"" he added. ""What's been holding them back economically?""
We'll get to see the full scope of the proposal soon. The plan is set to be released following the conclusion of the Muslim holiday of Ramadan, which ends in early June."
North Korea Fires Several Short-Range Projectiles into Sea,www1.cbn.com,,05-04-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/national-security/2019/may/north-korea-fires-several-short-range-projectiles-into-sea,"North Korea Fires Several Short-Range Projectiles into Sea 05-04-2019 Associated Press File photo of North Korean missile. (AP Photo)
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Saturday fired several unidentified short-range projectiles into the sea off its eastern coast, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said, a likely sign of Pyongyang’s growing frustration at stalled diplomatic talks with Washington meant to provide coveted sanctions relief in return for nuclear disarmament.
South Korea’s military has bolstered its surveillance in case there are additional weapons launches, and South Korean and U.S. authorities are analyzing the details. If it’s confirmed that the North fired banned ballistic missiles, it would be the first such launch since the North’s November 2017 test of an intercontinental ballistic missile. That year saw a string of increasingly powerful weapons tests from the North and a belligerent response from President Donald Trump that had many in the region fearing war.
The South initially reported Saturday that a single missile was fired, but later issued a statement that said “several projectiles” had been launched and that they flew up to 200 kilometers (125 miles) before splashing into the sea toward the northeast. Experts say the North may increase these sorts of low-level provocations to apply pressure on the United States to agree to reduce crushing international sanctions.
The launch comes amid a diplomatic breakdown that has followed the failed summit earlier this year between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over the North’s pursuit of nuclear bombs that can accurately target the U.S. mainland. The North probably has viable shorter range nuclear armed missiles but still needs more tests to perfect its longer-range weapons, according to outside analysts.
South Korea said in a statement it’s “very concerned” about North Korea’s weapons launches, calling them a violation of last year’s inter-Korean agreements to reduce animosities between the countries. The statement, issued after an emergency meeting of top officials at the presidential Blue House in Seoul, also urged North Korea to stop committing acts that would raise military tensions and join efforts to resume nuclear diplomacy.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that the United States was aware of North Korea’s actions and would continue to monitor the situation.
North Korea wants widespread sanctions relief in return for disarmament moves that the United States has rejected as insufficient. In a sign of Pyongyang’s growing frustration, it has recently demanded that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo be removed from nuclear negotiations and criticized national security adviser John Bolton. North Korea said last month that it had tested a new type of unspecified “tactical guided weapon.”
North Korea could choose to fire more missiles with longer ranges in coming weeks to ramp up its pressure on the United States to come up with a roadmap for nuclear talks by the end of this year, said Nam Sung-wook, a professor at Korea University.
“North Korea wants to say, ‘We have missiles and nuclear weapons to cope with (U.S.-led) sanctions,’” said Nam. “They can fire short-range missiles a couple more times this month, and there is no guarantee that they won’t fire a medium-range missile next month.”
During the diplomacy that followed the North’s weapons tests of 2017, Kim Jong Un said that the North would not test nuclear devices or ICBMs. These short-range projectiles don’t appear to violate that self-imposed moratorium, and may instead be a way to register Kim’s displeasure with Washington without having the diplomacy collapse.
outh Korea’s liberal president, Moon Jae-in, has doggedly pursued engagement with the North and is seen as a driving force behind the two summits between Trump and Kim.
South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha talked by phone with Pompeo about the North Korean launches, Kang’s ministry said in a statement. The ministry also said that South Korea’s chief nuclear envoy, Lee Do-hoon, had a telephone conversation with Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea who is scheduled to travel to Seoul next week for talks.
Japan’s Defense Ministry said the projectiles weren’t a security threat and didn’t reach anywhere near the country’s coast. Japan will likely avoid any harsh response as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seeks to secure his own summit with Kim.

GILLETTE, Wyo. (AP) — Wyoming Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Enzi announced Saturday that he will not run for a fifth term in 2020.
The 75-year-old made the announcement in his hometown of Gillette, where he owned a shoe store before becoming mayor in 1975. That was the start of a successful political career that led him to the Senate in 1996.
“I have much to get done in the next year and a half,” he said. “I want to focus on budget reform. I don’t want to be burdened by the distractions of another campaign. After this year, I’ll find other ways to serve.”
During his tenure in the Senate, Enzi has gained a reputation of being low-key and willing to work across party lines to produce results.
“I didn’t get into the Senate for the fancy titles,” Enzi, who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Saturday. “I like passing legislation.”
With Enzi’s retirement, Wyoming will have its first open Senate seat in more than a decade. It’s expected to remain in Republican hands. Wyoming hasn’t elected a Democrat to the Senate in over 40 years. The state’s other senator, Republican John Barrasso, easily won re-election last year.
Enzi’s departure could open the way for Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.
Five years ago, she launched an ill-fated challenge against Enzi. She dropped out of the race before the primary after being labeled a carpetbagger for having moved to Wyoming from Virginia barely a year earlier. Still, she was elected to Congress in 2014 and was re-elected last year.
Cheney has been a rising star in Congress and already is the third-most senior House Republican.
In a statement Saturday, Cheney didn’t mention any further intentions for the Senate seat.
She praised Enzi for his service to the state and country.
“He never forgot where he came from and always put the interests of Wyoming first, constantly championing our Western way of life,” Cheney said.

Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Louisiana on Friday to praise the members of three African American churches for the inspiring way they responded to the destruction of their church buildings by an arsonist and noted that attacks on communities of faith have become ""all too frequent.""
As CBN News reported , Holden Matthews, 21, the son of a local sheriff's deputy, has been accused of setting three separate fires at St. Mary Baptist Church on March 26, the Greater Union Baptist Church on April 2, and the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church on April 4.
The vice president also tweeted about his visit to Louisiana.

What happened here was evil, but these communities of faith overcame evil with good. pic.twitter.com/koWAtd3usE
— Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) May 3, 2019
Speaking in front of the burned ruins of the Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church building in Opelousas, Pence also alluded to the recent attacks on synagogues in California and Pittsburgh and on a mosque in New Zealand.
""Sadly we live in a time when attacks on communities of faith have become all too frequent,"" the vice president said.
""No one should ever fear for their safety in a house of worship, anywhere in this country, anywhere in the world. Attacks on communities of faith must stop,"" he said as church members around him raised a chorus of ""amens.""
Pence said he came to Louisiana to show the church members and their leaders that their country was supporting them. He added that he had been inspired by their example of how they met the destruction of their church buildings with courage and resilience as well as the forgiveness they gave to the man accused of setting the fires.
""After what happened at Saint Mary's and here at Mount Pleasant and Greater Union, you overcame evil with good,"" the vice president noted. ""You lived out your faith and had a testimony for Christ that echoed across the country. And I must tell you also: It was very inspirational to us to know that you still had Easter services right here at Mount Pleasant.""
""There's a verse that says, ""If the foundation crumbles, how can the righteous stand?"" And as I arrived today, the pastors and I spoke about the fact that while these -- the structure of these churches burned, what was evident to people all across America is the foundation was firm -- a foundation of faith and heart to charity,"" Pence continued.
""And I know, in my heart of hearts, based on that witness of faith and the generous outpouring of people across this state and across this nation, with great leadership at the state and federal level, and with great leadership in the pulpits of not only these three churches but all the churches across this area, that the best days for these three churches, for faith in Louisiana and faith in America, are yet to come,"" he concluded.
A recent online GoFundMe campaign to help rebuild the three church buildings raised more than $2.1 million. Pence said the sound of hammers would soon be heard at all three churches as reconstruction gets underway."

She praised Enzi for his service to the state and country.
“He never forgot where he came from and always put the interests of Wyoming first, constantly championing our Western way of life,” Cheney said.

'Inspired by Their Example': VP Mike Pence Praises Members of Black Churches Destroyed by Arson,www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,05-05-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/inspired-by-their-example-vp-mike-pence-praises-members-of-black-churches-destroyed-by-arson,"Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Louisiana on Friday to praise the members of three African American churches for the inspiring way they responded to the destruction of their church buildings by an arsonist and noted that attacks on communities of faith have become ""all too frequent.""
As CBN News reported , Holden Matthews, 21, the son of a local sheriff's deputy, has been accused of setting three separate fires at St. Mary Baptist Church on March 26, the Greater Union Baptist Church on April 2, and the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church on April 4.
The vice president also tweeted about his visit to Louisiana.
Joined the pastors of Mt Pleasant Baptist Church, St. Mary Baptist Church, & Greater Union Baptist Church at what remains of Mt Pleasant after an arsonist set fire to these 3 churches. What happened here was evil, but these communities of faith overcame evil with good. pic.twitter.com/koWAtd3usE
— Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) May 3, 2019
Speaking in front of the burned ruins of the Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church building in Opelousas, Pence also alluded to the recent attacks on synagogues in California and Pittsburgh and on a mosque in New Zealand.
""Sadly we live in a time when attacks on communities of faith have become all too frequent,"" the vice president said.
""No one should ever fear for their safety in a house of worship, anywhere in this country, anywhere in the world. Attacks on communities of faith must stop,"" he said as church members around him raised a chorus of ""amens.""
Pence said he came to Louisiana to show the church members and their leaders that their country was supporting them. He added that he had been inspired by their example of how they met the destruction of their church buildings with courage and resilience as well as the forgiveness they gave to the man accused of setting the fires.
""After what happened at Saint Mary's and here at Mount Pleasant and Greater Union, you overcame evil with good,"" the vice president noted. ""You lived out your faith and had a testimony for Christ that echoed across the country. And I must tell you also: It was very inspirational to us to know that you still had Easter services right here at Mount Pleasant.""
""There's a verse that says, ""If the foundation crumbles, how can the righteous stand?"" And as I arrived today, the pastors and I spoke about the fact that while these -- the structure of these churches burned, what was evident to people all across America is the foundation was firm -- a foundation of faith and heart to charity,"" Pence continued.
""And I know, in my heart of hearts, based on that witness of faith and the generous outpouring of people across this state and across this nation, with great leadership at the state and federal level, and with great leadership in the pulpits of not only these three churches but all the churches across this area, that the best days for these three churches, for faith in Louisiana and faith in America, are yet to come,"" he concluded.
A recent online GoFundMe campaign to help rebuild the three church buildings raised more than $2.1 million. Pence said the sound of hammers would soon be heard at all three churches as reconstruction gets underway."

Gaza militants fired hundreds of rockets into southern Israel on Sunday, killing at least four Israelis and bringing life to a standstill across the region in the bloodiest fighting since a 2014 war.
CBN News Jerusalem's Julie Stahl has this update from southern Israel.
Terrorists began the attack on southern Israel Saturday firing more than 450 rockets in 24 hours. Red Alert alarms warning residents to go to protected areas sounded from morning until night in southern Israel, along the coast and at one point as far north as Beit Shemesh, 20 miles outside Jerusalem.
Israel's KAN television reported one woman was seriously injured in the head from shrapnel from a rocket. Police said another man was also injured in a rocket attack.
A rocket slammed into a house near Ashkelon, causing damage but no injuries as the residents were able to take shelter before the rocket hit.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-rocket system intercepted dozens of rockets.
Israel struck back targeting more than 120 Hamas and Islamic Jihad sites by air and tank, the Israel Defense Forces said.
The IDF also said it had destroyed a Palestinian Islamic Jihad tunnel from the air that crossed under the border from Gaza into Israel. According to a statement, the purpose of the tunnel was to carry out terror attacks inside Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to meet with the security cabinet on Sunday to discuss Israel's continuing response.
We have just started carrying out an aerial strike of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad targets across Gaza.

The current round of violence started on Friday when two Israeli soldiers were hit by sniper fire from the Gaza Strip.
In response, the IDF targeted a Hamas military post in an aerial strike, killing two Hamas operatives.
Two Palestinians were also reportedly killed during the so-called Palestinian ""March of Return"" protests along the Gaza border."

Iran's intelligence minister has admitted publicly for the first time that Christianity is spreading throughout Iran.
Iranwire.com reports Mahmoud Alavi, the Islamic Republic's intelligence minister, was giving a speech in front of several Shia Muslim clerics when he announced ""Christianity is spreading in ""parts"" of Iran.""
In an apparent attempt to make light of the people are converting, Alavi said: ""These converts are ordinary people whose jobs are selling sandwiches or similar things.""
The intelligence minister also told the clerics to quit bickering among themselves.
""We had no choice but to summon them to ask them why they were converting,"" said Alavi told the assembled group. ""Some of them said they were looking for a religion that gives them peace. We told them that Islam is the religion of brotherhood and peace. They responded by saying that: 'All the time we see Muslim clerics and those who preach from the pulpit talk against each other. If Islam is the religion of cordiality, then before anything else, there must be cordiality and peace among the clerics themselves.""
""It is not the job of the intelligence community to find the roots of these conversions from Islam. But it's happening right before our eyes,"" he added.
Iran is known for its mounting persecution of Christians. The Islamic Republic is listed as number 9 among the world's top persecutors of Christians, according to Open Doors USA . Christians in Iran are forbidden from sharing their faith with non-Christians. Consequently, church services in Persian (Iran's national language) are not allowed. "
Columbine Victim’s Daughter Reveals Amazing Story of Forgiveness,www1.cbn.com,,05-05-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/columbine-victim-rsquo-s-daughter-reveals-amazing-story-of-forgiveness,"Columbine Victim’s Daughter Reveals Amazing Story of Forgiveness 05-05-2019 Coni Sanders, daughter of teacher Dave Sanders who died at Columbine. (Image credit: PureFlix Insider)
Forgiveness is one of the most difficult quests in the human experience, especially when it comes to horrific crimes and injustices. Survivors of events like the Columbine tragedy – people who have made a concerted effort to let go of hate and anger toward those who perpetrated the unthinkable — offer some of the most powerful acts of forgiveness for us to ponder.
Some of these incredible and touching stories are told in PureFlix.com’s “After Columbine ,” an original series that focuses on faith, hope and forgiveness 20 years after two students entered Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, and committed tragic acts of violence.
Coni Sanders, daughter of teacher Dave Sanders who died at Columbine, is now a therapist who works to help violent offenders get on the right path. In “After Columbine,” she revealed that she and Sue Klebold, one of the shooters’ mothers, have formed a surprising friendship .
WATCH NOW: Stream ‘After Columbine’ Right Now
“A lot of people will reference forgiveness in relation to my friendship with Sue Klebold,” she said. “I have nothing to forgive her for. She didn’t do this.”
Watch Sanders describe her story and see other amazing acts of forgiveness from Columbine survivors (you can watch the entire, three-part “After Columbine” series here ):
Sanders described her initial anger and frustration at the killers’ parents. But, as time went on and she had kids of her own, she said her perspective shifted.
“I could be the best parent in the world and my kids might still make choices and decisions that I don’t agree with,” she said.

Years after the 1999 attack, Sanders spoke with an author who was in touch with Klebold. Sanders told him that she would like to talk with Klebold, if Klebold was willing.
“A couple of months later I got an email from [Klebold] and she said, ‘I would be more than happy to meet with you,’” Sanders recounted. “I was so nervous. We decided to meet at a coffee shop in Littleton.”
As Sanders walked into the meeting, she recalled the thoughts that streamed through her mind.
“I kept thinking, ‘What am I doing here? This woman’s son murdered my dad,’” she said, noting, though, that she was so determined to find out why the assault happened that she forged on with the meeting.
In the end, Sanders was stunned by what she discovered.
“We started talking and she is one of the most peaceful, most compassionate, most comforting people I think I’ve ever known – and I didn’t want her to be,” Sanders said. “I wanted her to be awful, I wanted her to be terrible, I wanted it to be this, ‘Yup I knew it she’s a terrible person. She raised a terrible kid and that kid killed my dad.’”
That narrative, though, didn’t win out and the meeting was the start of an unlikely friendship between Sanders and Klebold.
“At the end of this coffee — two hours — she hugged me and she said, ‘I don’t know why I feel the need to tell you that I love you,’” Sanders said. “And I didn’t know why I had the feeling I wanted to tell her that back.”
Two years later and Sanders and Klebold meet every month to find ways that they can work together to create something powerful and impactful that doesn’t sensationalize their friendship.
“If anybody’s pain is greater than my own, in my eyes, it’s hers,” Sanders said.

How to Pray for Israel: Country Facing Onslaught of Deadly Rockets from Gaza,www.cbn.com,Chris Mitchell,05-05-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/may/how-to-pray-for-israel-facing-onslaught-of-deadly-rockets-from-gaza,"JERUSALEM -- As of Sunday evening, Israeli time, the statistics tell a grim story. Four Israelis dead, nearly 70 wounded, three seriously after Hamas and Islamic Jihad fired over 600 rockets into Israel in the past 72 hours. While the Iron Dome missile defense intercepted 150 of those rockets, 35 have struck populated areas. These rockets now put more than one million Israelis within range. They're indiscriminate weapons of terror designed to kill, maim and terrify the people Hamas has pledged in its founding charter to destroy.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his Security Cabinet Sunday evening to respond to this relentless barrage. It released a statement saying: ""The Cabinet has instructed the IDF to continue the strikes and to prepare for continuation. The supreme consideration is the security of the state and its residents.""
Already the IDF has hit dozens of targets within Gaza and targeted the man believed responsible for providing Iranian money from financing this war of terror. But how can they stop these deadly attacks without a massive incursion into the heart of Gaza? It's a daunting prospect to send thousands of troops into one of the most dangerous urban settings on the planet with its booby traps, honeycombed tunnels, and well-armed adversaries.
Just days away, Israel will be marking Memorial Day and then celebrating its 71st Independence Day. Soon thereafter Tel Aviv will host Eurovision, one of the most prestigious talent shows in the world. With Israel's coastal city within range of Hamas rockets, it presents a way Hamas could hold this event hostage.
Given these dire circumstances, Intercessors for Israel sent out an Emergency Prayer Alert about the escalation with Gaza on May 5th as Israel stands ""at the brink of war with the terrorists running Gaza.""
It provides key points for prayer and a roadmap to intercede for Israel's leaders, their people and their military as well as those innocent civilians in harm's way inside Gaza:
Pray for the Security Cabinet, the IDF General Staff and especially PM and Défense Minister Netanyahu that they will have God's tactics and strategy for the battle. Tactics: how to fight the day to day battles. Strategy: putting together the proper tactics to produce the desired end of war results. Pray for them to have God's timing and if it is the time that they would not hesitate to do what needs to be done, Eurovision or not. It is assumed by many in Israel, that Israel is holding back because of the upcoming ""Eurovision"" song extravaganza to be held in Tel Aviv next week. Many of the participating groups are already in Tel Aviv with more arriving daily. The finale will be May 18. Pray for the protection and success of the IDF soldiers who will be involved. Pray for the protection of civilians on both sides. During these days, it's important to remember the promise from the Psalmist: ""Indeed, He who watches over Israel, will neither slumber nor sleep."" Psalm 121:4"

Former Planned Parenthood clinic director and now pro-life advocate Abby Johnson posted a prayer request to her Facebook page this week about her outreach program to workers who would like to leave the abortion industry.
"" We need your prayers at And Then There Were None - Prolife Outreach. We are having literally at least one worker leave their job every single day...sometimes two a day. Please pray for our staff as we navigate this busy time. Big things are happening and we can confidently state that Unplanned has been a bigger blow to the abortion industry than we could have ever imagined! Change is coming, guys!""
Johnson's program is designed to provide financial, emotional, spiritual and legal support to anyone wishing to leave the abortion industry. The organization claims it has helped nearly 500 workers leave the profession.
""There is a lot of burnout in the abortion industry because promoting death is exhausting,"" Johnson told a crowd of thousands at Focus on the Family's ""Alive from New York"" event in New York City's Times Square on Saturday.
Johnson, whose story is told in the new movie ""Unplanned,"" also let the audience listen to her unborn baby's heartbeat.
""We will see a day when abortion in this country is unthinkable,"" she said."

JERUSALEM -- As of Sunday evening, Israeli time, the statistics tell a grim story. Four Israelis dead, nearly 70 wounded, three seriously after Hamas and Islamic Jihad fired over 600 rockets into Israel in the past 72 hours. While the Iron Dome missile defense intercepted 150 of those rockets, 35 have struck populated areas. These rockets now put more than one million Israelis within range. They're indiscriminate weapons of terror designed to kill, maim and terrify the people Hamas has pledged in its founding charter to destroy.

(Image credit: Jenna Browder, CBN News) 6033345386001 Live 4D Ultrasound Highlight of Focus on the Family's 'Alive from New York' Event
NEW YORK, NY - The issue of life took front and center this weekend in New York City's Times Square. In its first ""Alive from New York"" event, Focus on the Family turned out a massive show of support to protect the unborn.
There were live performances and speeches. But the main event was a live 4D ultrasound. The ultrasound was performed on Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood clinic director and now a pro-life activist and the inspiration behind the movie ""Unplanned.""
""This is a baby! This right here is a baby. This right here is a baby! It's not a cat. It's not a parasite. This is a human being with a heartbeat, with its own DNA that is separate from my body. And this baby deserves to live,"" Johnson told the assembled crowd numbering in the thousands.
The event was held in response to the decision of New York and other states to legalize abortion up until the moment of birth.
Focus on the Family reported 10,000 people registered for the event, but it wasn't just the pro-life crowd that showed up.
""You're hateful! Get out of our city!"" screamed a large and very vocal group of protestors set up across the street.
The ministry initially hoped to use the billboard jumbotrons in Times Square to show the ultrasound, but President Jim Daly told CBN News their plans fell through.
""Well, we had 12 weeks to plan the event so we went right to the jumbotrons to see if we could rent the space and initially they all said yes in different ways,"" he explained. ""And then when we began to describe what we were going to do, they started not returning phone calls or saying that this would be too political and they're uncomfortable with it.""
CBN News contacted those companies for a response.
ABC gave us this statement: ""It is our policy that we do not accept live advertising on our Times Square video screen.""
Clear Channel Outdoor responded: ""Our company's longstanding practice is to carefully consider all serious and legitimate inquiries for media space. We stood ready to apply this same fair treatment to Focus on the Family, yet upon learning that ads on our billboards require a creative approval -- they never presented any artwork for review and instead galvanized their loyal supporters with misinformation to generate earned media attention.""
""That's really not accurate,"" Daly explained. ""They knew exactly what we were going to do and told us they were uncomfortable with it.""
Still, the event turned out to be the largest pro-life event ever held in The Big Apple.
The state of New York may be considered by some the nation's ""abortion capital,"" but seven other states and the District of Columbia also have no restrictions on late-term abortion."

Just 18 months after suffering a spinal injury in which doctors told him he only had a 20-percent chance of walking again, Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier danced with his wife on their wedding day Saturday.
Videos shared on social media show Shazier and his wife dancing after their wedding with other couples on a dance floor. Several of his Steelers teammates also attended the nuptials. About a year and a half ago, Ryan Shazier was told he had a 20% chance of ever walking again. This was him today at his wedding.. Anything is possible!
This man is such an inspiration to all! #Shalieve @RyanShazier pic.twitter.com/Z0eOqoj42t
— Steel Faithful (@Steel_Faithful) May 4, 2019
As CBN News reported , Shazier was injured during a Monday Night Football game against the Cincinnati Bengals on December 4, 2017. He underwent spinal stabilization surgery three days later at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC).
Just one month following his injury, the linebacker posted a photo to Instagram which showed him in a wheelchair at the Steelers practice facility.
In his post, Shazier credited God for allowing him to achieve this ""first downs"" by attending practice. ""I want to thank the Lord for the first downs that he has been allowing me to achieve. The touchdown is going to come in his timing, but today was a first down. I was finally able to make it to practice with my teammates,"" he wrote.
""The Lord has not finished his work yet,"" he continued.
Since that time, Shazier has been working toward his goal of a full recovery by walking, jogging, and lifting weights.
The Steelers have also showed his progress during his journey by posting video of him doing his exercises. In a video posted just last month, Shazier is seen jumping by himself from a standing position to a higher platform."

Financial Planning When a Family Member Has Special Needs,www.cbn.com,Associated Press,05-06-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/may/financial-planning-when-a-family-member-has-special-needs,"Financial planning is daunting enough, but it becomes more complicated and critical when you have a child or family member with special needs.
If you don’t leave any money or support in place, their fate may be left up to the court and wellbeing could suffer. If you leave too much, they could lose access to critical government services or be forced to pay back the state for some of their care.
GET STARTED
It’s never too early to get started, and it’s also never too late, said John Nadworny, Cynthia Haddad and Alexandria Nadworny, the special needs financial planning team at Shepherd Financial Partners.
The worst mistake you can make is having no plan. This sometimes happens because it’s so overwhelming it prevents a family from planning at all. But it doesn’t have to be a massive undertaking in every case, said Nadworny: a young family may just need life insurance and an estate plan. What you need can evolve over time.
Don’t overlook estate planning if you have limited means either, it’s critical to put basic safeguards in place if someone relies on you for care.
“If there’s no plan, it’s chaos,” said Haddad.
START SMALL
If you do only one thing, write a letter of intent.
The letter outlines a family’s hope for an individual and their estate. It communicates your vision for the child or family member’s life, who will be involved and how. It can also include critical information about medical, financial or other essentials, such as the individual’s daily routine, likes and dislikes. Update it annually.
All the money in the world cannot provide the information that parents may have in their hearts and minds for their children, Nadworny said.
Best of all, it’s free.
GET HELP
It can be very complex to navigate what is needed for each family’s unique situation.
Get help in whatever form you can. James Fox, an AXA Advisor and special needs financial planner, suggests asking other families with special needs their input or looking into free training through advocacy groups or support groups. This is a situation where a paid professional, such as a certified financial planner with a special needs designation or a disability law attorney, can be critical.
They can walk you through the ins and outs of various financial tools available, such as special needs trusts, ABLE accounts and more. Commonly used financial tools, such as life insurance and Roth IRAs, take on new weight for families in this situation. They will have special insight on the implications the various tools will have on taxes, government benefits and more.
Look for a fee-based professional, versus one who gets paid for selling products.
And don’t overlook your own financial wellbeing. Fox said that if you forgo taking care of yourself, it may mean you cannot provide the care for your family that you hoped for.

Israel Signals Cease-Fire With Gaza After Hundreds of Rockets,www.cbn.com,Associated Press,05-06-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/may/israel-signals-cease-fire-with-gaza-after-hundreds-of-rockets,"JERUSALEM (AP) - The Israeli army on Monday lifted protective restrictions on residents in southern Israel, while the Hamas militant group's radio station in the Gaza Strip reported a cease-fire, signaling a deal had been reached to end the bloodiest fighting between the two sides since a 2014 war.
There was no official cease-fire announcement from either side, but the intense fighting over the past two days appeared to come to a sudden halt in the early morning hours.
The Israeli military announced its decision, saying: ""As of 7 a.m., all protective restrictions in the home front will be lifted.""
Schools and roads had been closed, and residents had been encouraged to remain indoors and near bomb shelters as intense rocket fire pounded the area.
In Gaza, Hamas' Al-Aqsa radio station had a short item saying a cease-fire had been reached. However, neither the strip's Hamas rulers nor the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group that is active in Gaza issued any formal announcement.
Israel and Hamas are bitter enemies and have fought three wars and numerous smaller battles since the Islamic militant group seized control of Gaza in 2007.
In the latest fighting, which erupted over the weekend, Palestinian militants fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, while the Israeli military responded with airstrikes on dozens of targets inside Gaza.
Palestinian medical officials reported 23 deaths, including at least nine militants as well as two pregnant women and two babies. Four Israelis also were killed from incoming fire, the first Israeli fatalities from rocket fire since the 50-day war in 2014.
Egyptian mediators had been working with the United Nations to broker a cease-fire. Under past Egyptian-brokered deals, Israel has agreed to ease a crippling blockade of Gaza in exchange for a halt to rocket fire.
The latest fighting broke out after Palestinian militants accused Israel of not honoring an earlier cease-fire deal from March.
The terms of the latest deal were not immediately known, but recent cease-fires have been short-lived.

Political commentator Christian Sommers pointed out that Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.
""Gaza is occupied by Hamas, not Israel. Hamas is funded by Iran and works against the interest of Palestinians. It terrorizes the Gaza population and shoots rockets into civilian areas of Israel.

Jordan Schachtel from the Conservative Review accused Omar of promoting ""Hamas propaganda."" This is outright Hamas propaganda, rife with countless falsehoods. There is no occupation in Gaza.

Former United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley urged every presidential candidate to weigh in on the rocket attacks so America knows where they stand.
""Imagine if 600 rockets had been fired into the US or any other country besides Israel. What country would not defend itself?

ASHKELON, Israel – It was a turbulent weekend in Israel but after two days of violence, Hamas said it agreed to a ceasefire. It had seemed that Israel was set for a major escalation but on Monday morning Israel’s Home Front Command lifted all restrictions for civilians in the south.
Still, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement indicating that the battle was not over.
“Over the last two days we struck Hamas and Islamic Jihad with great force. We hit over 350 targets. We struck at terrorist leaders and operatives and we destroyed terrorist buildings,"" Netanyahu said.
""The campaign is not over and it demands patience and sagacity. We are prepared to continue. The goal has been – and remains – ensuring quiet and security for the residents of the south. I send condolences to the families and best wishes for recovery to the wounded,"" he said.
Over the weekend, sirens blared sending Israelis running to bomb shelters as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) launched more than 700 rockets at southern Israel in less than 48 hours.
“Those rockets are dangerous. Those rockets can be deadly. Those rockets are being fired by Hamas toward the civilian population here in Israel,” said Israel Police National Spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.
One of the rockets hit on a quiet street in Ashkelon about five miles from the Gaza border. It killed 58-year-old Moshe Agadi who didn’t have time to reach his shelter.
Several other casualties marked the first time since 2014 that Israeli civilians have been killed from rocket attacks out of the Gaza Strip.
“If we take into consideration how many people there are in the southern part of Israel, the major cities and in the kibbutzim and in the local different communities, we’re talking about more than a million Israelis under the threat of those rockets from the Gaza Strip,” he added.
Many of the rockets fell in open areas and more than 150 were intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome.
“Hamas and the PIJ are operating together…they have fired massive amounts of rockets at different Israeli cities,” said IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus.
Israel struck back hitting some 350 terror targets including a terrorist responsible for transferring Iranian funds to groups inside Gaza.
“The unfortunate situation is Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad are able to smuggle into the Gaza strip as well as produce substantial amounts of rockets of different calibers cable of striking Israeli civilians,” Conricus added.
“We see Iranian fingerprints mostly in the Gaza Strip focused on the Palestinian Islamic Jihad but not limited to… that materializes in money weapons logistic support, military training and of course political guidance.”
The IDF also blew up a PIJ tunnel that the IDF says would have been used to carry out terror attacks inside Israel.
“The moment that tunnel crossed into Israel we took the opportunity to strike and dismantle that tunnel, sending a clear message to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and to other terrorists in Gaza that we are aware of their activities and we have the ability to locate and destroy these offensive terrorist infrastructures,” said Conricus.
President Trump tweeted out US backing for Israel, saying: ""We support Israel 100 percent in its defense of its citizens."" once again, israel faces a barrage of deadly rocket attacks by terrorist groups hamas and islamic jihad. We support israel 100% in its defense of its citizens....

For now, it’s quiet. Many think Memorial Day, Independence Day and the upcoming international song contest in Tel Aviv, Eurovision, put the brakes on Israel’s response.
It’s likely just a matter of time before the situation explodes again. Then Israel will have to decide if it will be held hostage to Hamas or take more forceful action."
Showdown With Iran? US Deploys USS Strike Group to Send 'Clear and Unmistakable Message' to Iran,www1.cbn.com,,05-06-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/may/showdown-with-iran-us-deploys-uss-strike-group-to-send-clear-and-unmistakable-message-to-iran,"Showdown With Iran? US Deploys USS Strike Group to Send 'Clear and Unmistakable Message' 05-06-2019 Emily Jones iranianleadermikepompeo_hdv.jpg
The United States is sending the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the Middle East to ""send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime.""
National Security Advisor John Bolton announced the move in a statement Sunday night and said it was a move ""in response to a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings,"" including a bloody conflict between Iranian-funded Palestinian terrorists in Gaza and Israel.
""(Any) attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force. The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces.""
The deployment comes just weeks after President Donald Trump designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terror group.
Fox News reports that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters the deployment is ""something we've been working on for a little while"" and ""we will hold the Iranians accountable for attacks on American interests. If these actions take place, if they do by some third-party proxy, a militia group, Hezbollah, we will hold the Iranian leadership directly accountable for that.""
Axios reported Sunday that the Trump Administration will launch a new round of sanctions against Iran on Wednesday, one year after the US pulled out the Obama-era Iran sanctions.
The deployment comes on the backdrop of the worst conflict between Israel and Gaza since 2014.
Last Friday, two Israeli soldiers were injured by snipers from the Iran-backed militant group Islamic Jihad. Islamic Jihad and Hamas launched nearly 700 rockets at Israel over the weekend, killing four Israelis.
Israel's former National Security Advisor Yaakov Amidror told The Israel Project Sunday that Iran was behind the escalation in Gaza.
Amidror said Islamic Jihad, unlike Hamas, is completely owned by Iran.
""It was established by Iran, financed by Iran, and does what Iran wants it to do.""
Hamas, Amidror said, was ""dragged"" into the escalation between Israel and Gaza."

WINDSOR, England (AP) - A beaming Prince Harry said his wife Meghan gave birth to a baby boy early Monday morning. Harry says he's ""incredibly proud"" of his wife and that they have a healthy baby boy who weighs 7 pounds 3 ounces. He has not yet been named. Harry said the child was a little bit overdue and that had given them more time to contemplate names. He says he is ecstatic about the birth of their first child and said more details will be shared in the coming days. ""This little baby is absolutely to die for,"" he said. ""I'm just over the moon."" The infant will be seventh in line to the British throne and Queen Elizabeth II's eighth great-grandchild. Harry is the younger son of Prince Charles, the next in line to the throne, and the late Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997. The child will be eligible for dual British-U.S. citizenship if Meghan and Harry want to go through the application process. Harry, speaking before TV cameras on Monday afternoon was present for the birth, which he said was an amazing experience. The couple has said they didn't find out the baby's sex in advance. Senior royals have been informed of the birth, as has the family of Princess Diana, Harry's late mother. Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, was formerly known as Meghan Markle and was a TV star before retiring from acting to marry Harry at St. George's Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle a year ago. Journalists and well-wishers have camped out for days in Windsor, about 35 kilometers (22 miles) west of London, awaiting the baby's arrival. Meghan, a California native, had a starring role on the American TV series ""Suits."" She had a previous marriage that ended in divorce and has strong feminist views. As the daughter of a black mother and a white father, she says she identifies as biracial. Harry, who has said he wanted to protect his wife from intrusive media coverage, and Meghan have said they plan to keep many of the details of the birth private. The birth marks the completion of Harry's transformation from troubled teenager to committed military man to proud father. He has long spoken of his desire to start a family. He and his older brother, Prince William, along with their wives, are seen by many in Britain as the new, fresh face of a royal family that had become stodgy and aged. They are raising the next generation of royals amid a genuine groundswell of public support for the monarchy. Meghan in particular represents a change for the royals: She is American, older than her husband, divorced, and comes from a biracial background. She also achieved considerable success in her own right before agreeing to a blind date with Harry that changed both their lives. Meghan had an important role in the popular TV series ""Suits"" and had a wide following even before she joined the world's most famous royal family. Harry and Meghan recently moved from central London to a secluded house known as Frogmore Cottage near Windsor Castle, 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of London. The move is seen in part as reflecting a desire for privacy as they raise their first child. It also separates Harry and Meghan from William and his wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, who had been living in the same compound at Kensington Palace in central London.

The captain of a chartered plane that skidded off the runway and came to rest in a river late last week said it was “a miracle” no one died in the accident.

Incredibly, despite the dramatic nature of the crash, authorities say that none of the passengers were seriously injured, and that they were all successfully rescued from the Boeing 737’s wings. The only passenger to be hospitalized was a young infant, who is said to be doing well.
“I think it is a miracle,” said Capt. Michael Connor, the base’s commanding officer, according to the Associated Press . “We could be talking about a different story this evening.”

Unfortunately, three pets were lost in the plane’s underside cargo section. “There’s water in the cargo hold,” said Kaylee LaRocque, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Navy, according to USA Today . “We are so sad about this situation, that there are animals that unfortunately passed away.”
“Our hearts and prayers go out to those pet owners during this terrible incident,” the Navy base tweeted out early Saturday. What caused the crash?
On Monday, it was reported that the crash could have been caused by an “inoperative” landing system on the Boeing 737. According to the BBC , investigators are currently looking into the failure of the “thrust reverser” system, which helps the plane slow down after landing.
“The aircraft had been in maintenance and the maintenance log noted that the left-hand thrust reverser was inoperative,” said Bruce Landsberg, vice-chairman of the US National Transportation Safety Board, at a press conference Sunday.
In addition, investigators noted that the pilots had requested a runway change shortly before landing. The runway they chose to land on had equipment set up on it and was therefore shorter than usual — cut from 9,000 feet to just 7,800."

The deployment comes just weeks after President Donald Trump designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terror group.
Fox News reports that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters the deployment is ""something we've been working on for a little while"" and ""we will hold the Iranians accountable for attacks on American interests. If these actions take place, if they do by some third-party proxy, a militia group, Hezbollah, we will hold the Iranian leadership directly accountable for that.""
Axios reported Sunday that the Trump Administration will launch a new round of sanctions against Iran on Wednesday, one year after the US pulled out the Obama-era Iran sanctions.
The deployment comes on the backdrop of the worst conflict between Israel and Gaza since 2014.
Last Friday, two Israeli soldiers were injured by snipers from the Iran-backed militant group Islamic Jihad. Islamic Jihad and Hamas launched nearly 700 rockets at Israel over the weekend, killing four Israelis.
Israel's former National Security Advisor Yaakov Amidror told The Israel Project Sunday that Iran was behind the escalation in Gaza.
Amidror said Islamic Jihad, unlike Hamas, is completely owned by Iran.
""It was established by Iran, financed by Iran, and does what Iran wants it to do.""
Hamas, Amidror said, was ""dragged"" into the escalation between Israel and Gaza."

Award-winning Christian singer Lauren Daigle has returned to American Idol as a celebrity mentor.
The 27-year-old artist appeared on the show 10 years ago when she was 17 to audition for her chance to be the next American Idol . Even though Daigle got a “no” from the judges at the time, she has become a force to be reckoned with in the music industry earning multiple top awards this year.
Now, the new contestants hope to learn from her mistakes and victories. We are so happy to welcome @Lauren_Daigle back to Idol. She will be a phenomenal mentor to our contestants! #AmericanIdol pic.twitter.com/JDAGodejw2

“When I was 17, I tried out for American Idol . I look back on that, 10 years ago, and I think, man, the journey has been so incredible. Like it really has. This show gave me something to believe in, it really did,” the Grammy winner recalled in an exclusive sneak peek from People magazine.
“I heard y’all are doing showstopper songs, is that right? Oh, it’s going to be good! Can’t wait to see who comes out on top,” Daigle continued. “You’re welcome, no pressure.”
Daigle opened up about her experience on American Idol with Cosmopolitan a few weeks ago.
“It’s amazing how a ‘no’ can be detrimental in one place and how much power it can give you,” she said at the time. “You Say” singer @Lauren_Daigle didn’t let a “no” from Simon Cowell on @AmericanIdol ( #tbt ) stop her from landing a sweet deal with a record label. pic.twitter.com/dnKBSNqhIZ
— Cosmopolitan (@Cosmopolitan) April 25, 2019 Daigle has done just fine without American Idol.
She won a Grammy Award for her album “Look Up Child” and she just earned three Billboard Music Awards. She performed the song “You Say” in this year’s 2019 Billboard Music Awards last Week.
Daigle has come under fire in recent months as some have accused her of watering down her Christian faith in her appearances on popular TV shows. But right before her American Idol mentoring appearance, she posted a verse from Philippians 4:6-7 about not being anxious but trusting in God: “It’s wonderful what happens when Christ displaces worry at the center of your life.”"
"Blind Indian Pastor Finally Acquitted, but Christians Targeted 80 Times by Violent Mobs So Far This Year",www1.cbn.com,,05-06-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/may/blind-indian-pastor-finally-acquitted-but-christians-targeted-80-times-by-violent-mobs-so-far-this-year,"CBNNews.com Blind Indian Pastor Finally Acquitted, but Christians Targeted 80 Times by Violent Mobs So Far This Year 05-06-2019 Steve Warren The Balu family. (Image credit: ADF International)
A pastor's case took three years to be settled by an Indian court, but now his acquittal is being hailed as a triumph by Christian persecution watch groups.
In 2016, Pastor Balu Saste, his wife, and eleven other church members in the small village of Madhya Pradesh were violently attacked by a mob during church services. Local police arrested Balu (who is blind), his wife, and his six-year-old son, stripped them of their clothes, beat them, and kept them detained without bail for three days. They were also falsely charged with forcing conversions to Christianity and convicted.
ADF International , the global partner of US-based Alliance Defending Freedom, reports the landmark ruling marks an important victory against India's anti-conversion laws, which increasingly threaten the fundamental rights of religious minorities.
""Nobody should be persecuted because of their faith,"" Tehmina Arora, director of ADF India said in a press release. ""The acquittal of Pastor Balu and his family is a vital step towards the protection of religious freedom and the right to freely live out one's faith. Now he can continue to tend to his small community of Christians without interference from the state.""
""Unfortunately, this is not the only case in India where Christians have been falsely accused under anti-conversion laws,"" Arora added. ""These laws make religious minorities subject to arbitrary imprisonments and criminal charges, mob violence, and violations of their fundamental rights.""
ADF International also warns violence against Christians has risen significantly. In the first quarter of the year, the United Christian Forum and ADF India documented more than 80 violent mob attacks against Christians in 13 different states across India. The attacks often take a similar shape and rarely receive any police attention.
""The case of Pastor Balu provides a telling example of the injustices faced by many Christians in India,"" Paul Coleman, executive director of ADF International said in a press release. ""The important ruling in his case shows that the fundamental rights of religious minorities can and should be protected in the courtroom and through effective legal advocacy.""
""Sadly, the recent violence and mob attacks are not isolated incidents but testify to what many Christians experience in India today,"" he noted. ""All people have the right to freely choose, and live out their faith. We urge the Indian government to uphold this right and do more to protect religious minorities and promote religious freedom.""
For the first time, India is now listed in the Top Ten of countries on the World Watch List for the persecution of Christians."

After a week of unrest in Venezuela, the future of the people there appears as uncertain as ever. Those who study turbulent governments say Venezuela's latest uprising may just be a battle and not the war.
For now, Caracas seems almost normal, in stark contrast to days ago when four people were killed and hundreds were injured in a revolt led by self-proclaimed Interim President Juan Guaido. He and supporters are trying to topple dictator Nicolas Maduro and hold a fair election. The effort, though energetic, was met by violent force and proved unsuccessful -- at least for now. But Michael O'Hanlon with the Brookings Institution says that could change. ""There's no algorithm, there's no science to predicting what's going to happen next,"" O'Hanlon said. ""It's a test of will, it's a test of loyalty of institutions and it's a test on some level of the humane-ness of the leader who we already know is not really humane."" O'Hanlon says it's important for the US to build more support for a Venezuelan democracy with neighboring countries. ""We need the Colombias, the Brazils, the Chiles, the Argentinas, even the Ecuadors and Bolivias if we can, and Mexico, and making whatever happens a unified western hemisphere action,"" O'Hanlon said. That's especially important considering the support Maduro is likely getting from Iran as discussed on CBN's 700 Club. Yaakov Katz, author of Shadow Strike , said, ""We can only imagine what role the Iranians might be playing in providing logistics, weapons, technical support to Maduro and what that could potentially mean for the rest of the continent no less for the United States.""
In Washington, four people were arrested Thursday when pro-Guaido protesters squared off against Maduro supporters at the Venezuelan Embassy. Meanwhile, the United States is not backing off. President Trump said, ""The brutal repression of the Venezuelan people must end and it must end soon."" According to White House, during a phone call Friday, the president reiterated that to Russian President Vladimir Putin who supports Maduro. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said, ""The president is continuing to push for aid to be delivered to those people, beyond that all options continue to be on the table."" When asked if there would be any time table for military intervention, the White House has declined to comment, only saying that right now the emphasis is on diplomacy and providing aid to the people of Venezuela."
'The Real Answer Is Jesus': 400 Soldiers Find Hope in Christ as Non-Profit Offers Extreme Adventure,www1.cbn.com,,05-06-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/the-real-answer-is-jesus-400-soldiers-find-hope-in-christ-as-non-profit-offers-extreme-adventure,"Soldiers 6033467041001 'The Real Answer Is Jesus': 400 Find Hope in Christ as Non-Profit Offers Extreme Adventure for Soldiers
Active duty soldiers go through rigorous training to be able to fight on the front lines of combat, but despite that physical training, their spiritual well being is oftentimes overlooked and they can suffer in silence from things like post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression.
However, one non-profit is helping soldiers by getting them involved in extreme sports in order to share the message that true freedom and healing can be found in Christ.
Soul Survivor Outdoor hosts free outdoor adventure events like skydiving, rock-climbing, rappelling, and sailing to reach active duty military, veterans, and their families.
""You get people on the side of a rock or a mountain and it challenges them in ways that they aren't getting challenged in an office environment when they are going doing a normal day-to-day routine,"" Rick Wolf told CBN News.
Wolf is a retired Marine corp lieutenant colonel and the founder of Soul Survivor Outdoor. He started the program after finding that deployed combat soldiers would return home battling serious problems like PTSD, suicide, and substance abuse.
""Whether we're talking about the veteran population or the active duty population we know that statistically, the suicide rates are not coming down,"" he explained. ""Depression, anxiety... these things are pretty significant in the society in general and the military is a cut of the cloth.""
Wolf said although there are programs to help veterans and even active duty soldiers manage these issues, most don't deal with the root cause. ""As Christians, we know the real answer is Jesus Christ,"" he added. So, Wolf takes them off base and into the air or on top of a mountain to deal with real issues and lead them to the Lord.
The message he shares centers on finding your identity in Christ and it rings loud and clear in the hearts of these warriors. ""Your value as a human being whether you are in the military or someplace else is intrinsic because it comes from your Creator and not from your career, your status, or your phone or something else, but that you really have value,"" Wolf explained. So far, more than 5,000 active duty soldiers have attended Soul Survivor Outdoor events, and last year, alone, 400 soldiers gave their lives to Christ.
Wolf believes the church is missing an opportunity to evangelize soldiers.
""Who more deserving to have the opportunity to receive the Gospel of Jesus Christ than this person that has the idea, and they may not even know where it comes from, that no greater love has someone than this to lay down their life for a friend,"" he said.
As 165,000 active duty soldiers have been deployed in more than 150 countries this year, Wolf says his organization has only begun to scratch the surface."
‘God has not given us a spirit of fear’: Bieber urges fans to turn to Jesus when battling anxiety,www1.cbn.com,Brian Blackwell,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/may/god-has-not-given-us-a-spirit-of-fear-bieber-urges-fans-to-turn-to-jesus-when-battling-anxiety,"A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on May 2, 2019 at 6:59am PDT
Although the pop star has been very open about his faith in Christ, he says he still struggles with his identity as a child of God.
He recently reached out publicly for prayer, admitting his struggle with depression in the aftermath of years of wild living. But he told fans a few weeks ago that ""God is faithful and UR prayers really work.""
Now he's continuing that conversation on Instagram saying, ""I haven't believed the truth about myself - I haven't believed I am loved - I haven't believed I am forgiven it's a hard thing for me to wrap my head around. I hang my head in shame and I wallow in sadness about the people who have betrayed me.""
Then he put the focus on Jesus.
""Jesus has given me freedom and the pursuit of getting to know his character is never ending. God's character never changes - he is the same yesterday now and forever. He is always good! I won't be afraid to be vulnerable before him.. his power is made strong in our weakness. God isn't afraid of your pain and your brokenness he actually welcomes it. Come to me all who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest! these are words from Jesus!""
He encouraged others to put their trust in Jesus as well.
""There is hope and it's in him!! He loves and cares for you! For God so loved the world that he gave his only son so that whoever believes him won't die but have eternal life! You are that whoever and he accepts you as you are!! He loves and forgives you and welcomes you into his arms every time you mess. He is a perfect and loving God who adores you!""
Bieber regularly uses his huge social media platform to share the gospel message with his more than 100 million followers.
He recently married model Hailey Baldwin, who told Vogue magazine in 2016 that she believes God has given her fame to ""not be quiet about Him, but to reach people and inspire people."""
Democrats Plan to Hold Attorney General Barr in Contempt Over Mueller Report,www1.cbn.com,,05-06-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/may/democrats-plan-to-hold-attorney-general-barr-in-contempt-over-mueller-report,"Democrats Plan to Hold Attorney General Barr in Contempt Over Mueller Report 05-06-2019 Abigail Robertson Attorney General William Barr (Photo credit: Patrick Robertson/CBN News)
CAPITOL HILL - Democrats are taking steps toward holding Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for failing to provide an un-redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.
They had given him a deadline of 9:00 am Monday, but Barr did not comply.
How are Republicans on the Hill reacting to this move?
The ranking Republican member on the House Judiciary Committee Doug Collins said he believes this is just a move to distract and tear down the president. A few top Democrats with higher security clearances were offered an opportunity to read a less redacted version of Mueller's report. But they turned it down.
Collins released a statement Monday saying Democrats know Attorney General Barr cannot release an unredacted report without breaking the law – he believes if Democrats really want to see this they should be introducing legislation to allow Barr to release grand jury material instead of moving forward with holding him in contempt.
He added in an interview on Fox News that there's nothing to impeach here and he thinks Democrats are chasing after an election they lost in 2016.
Still, some Democrats have called for efforts to impeach Barr over his recent statements. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has accused the attorney general of lying and committing an actual ""crime"" in the process. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Pelosi's accusations are ""reckless, irresponsible and false.""
Will we ever see Mueller testify before Congress?
Right now, he's tentatively set to testify about his investigation before the House Judiciary Committee on May 15. President Trump tweeted about this over the weekend. He feels strongly that Robert Mueller does not need to testify writing:
""After spending more than $35,000,000 over a two year period, interviewing 500 people, using 18 Trump Hating Angry Democrats & 49 FBI Agents - all culminating in a more than 400-page Report showing NO COLLUSION - why would the Democrats in Congress now need Robert Mueller to testify. Are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong NO COLLUSION conclusion? There was no crime, except on the other side (incredibly not covered in the Report), and NO OBSTRUCTION. Bob Mueller should not testify. No redos for the Dems!"" ....to testify. Are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong NO COLLUSION conclusion?

But other Republicans say they wouldn't actually mind seeing Mueller testify and having an opportunity to have him clear the air on a few things. They do feel like he'll repeat what's in the report – but even Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent Mueller a letter on Friday inviting him to testify and clear up anything that's been misreported about his investigation.
Meanwhile, President Trump is pointing his finger back at his opponents tweeting, ""Also, there are 'No High Crimes & Misdemeanors,' No Collusion, No Conspiracy, No Obstruction. ALL THE CRIMES ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE, and that's what the Dems should be looking at, but they won't. Nevertheless, the tables are turning!""

The UNC Charlotte student who tackled a gunman, and was killed in the scuffle, was buried with full military honors on Sunday.
ABC News reported Riley Howell, 21, was enrolled in ROTC courses at the school. He had been hailed as a hero by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney in a press conference last week.
Howell ""took the assailant off his feet,"" allowing officers to step in and apprehend him, Putney said. Without him, ""the assailant may not have been disarmed. His sacrifice saved lives.""
Howell and 19-year-old Ellis Parlier were killed in the shooting. Four others were wounded. They were identified as Drew Pescaro, 19, and Sean Dehart, 20, both of Apex, NC; Rami Alramadhan, 20, of Saudi Arabia; and Emily Houpt, 23, of Charlotte, according to Fox News .
The suspect, 22-year-old Trystan Andrew Terrell, who allegedly opened fire in a university classroom, has been charged with two counts of murder and four counts of attempted murder.
Howell received an honor guard detail, the folding and presenting of the American flag to his family, and a rendition of ""Taps"" played at his funeral service.
More than 66,000 people signed a petition on the website whitehouse.gov pushing for the special ceremony, several Asheville media outlets reported.
""Riley was an ROTC cadet and would have served his country. Instead, he died saving the lives of his classmates. For his heroism, we ask that Riley be given a burial with full military honors,"" the petition read.
Howell's public funeral was held at Stuart Auditorium at Lake Junaluska Sunday.
""Riley was truly a one of a kind guy,"" his family said in a statement after he was killed. ""He loved all things outdoors, adventure, and especially family. He loved to work outside and when he worked, he did it with his hands and his heart. He always was able to put others before himself and never hesitated to help anyone who needed it. He was friends with anyone and every one--a big, muscular guy with a huge heart.""
""He was the kind of person who you knew would take care of you the moment you met him, and he always did,"" the statement continued. ""He radiated love and always will. """

(Mississippi Department of Public Safety via AP)
A member of an African American church in Mississippi who admitted to setting a historic church building on fire was sentenced last week to 10 years in prison. But the man never took responsibility for painting the words ""Vote Trump"" on the outside of the building earlier the same night as the fire.
Both the fire and the vandalism at the Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church in Greenville occurred one week before the 2016 presidential election. It caused some local residents to fear the fire could have been a hate crime. The building was a total loss.
Andrew McClinton, of Leland, MS, pleaded guilty to setting the fire in March but did not admit to spray-painting the building beforehand. Circuit Judge Margaret Carey-McCray sentenced him to 10 years in prison for arson, along with a 10-year suspended sentence with some of the suspended sentence under state supervision.
Because of his previous felony convictions for attempted armed robbery in 1997 and armed robbery in 2004, both in another part of Mississippi, McClinton will not be eligible for early release.
Washington County District Attorney Dewayne Richardson told The Associated Press that McClinton was involved in ""illicit"" activities at the church and set the fire to prevent fellow congregants from meeting the next day to discuss the activities.
""He was trying to hide that information from being disclosed,"" Richardson said.
Greenville is located about 120 miles northwest of Jackson, MS. About 78% of the city's 32,100 residents are African American.
Founded in 1905 in the heart of an African American neighborhood, the Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church has a congregation of about 200 members. A new church building has been constructed in its place using some of the old church's walls."

Pope Francis is pushing for a global authority that supersedes the rights of individual countries, all with the goal of pursuing the common good.
""Think of the great contemporary challenges of climate change, new slavery and peace,"" he told members of the Pontifical Academy.
They met last week at the Vatican to discuss the topic of: ""Nation, State, Nation-State.""
While addressing the conference, Francis rebuked the trend of nationalism among individual countries and the many tensions that ""come from an excessive demand for sovereignty,"" according to Breitbart.com .
However, the pope defended patriotism as a good thing. But he warned it can become perverted when ""it involves the exclusion and hatred of others when it becomes a conflictual nationalism that builds walls, indeed even racism or anti-Semitism.""
Francis also implied national sovereignty becomes twisted when countries do not have a welcoming attitude toward migrants.
""The Church observes with concern the reemergence, in many parts of the world, of currents that are aggressive towards foreigners, especially immigrants, as well as a growing nationalism that neglects the common good,"" he told the conference.
This, in turn, ""threatens to jeopardize consolidated forms of international cooperation, undermines the aims of international organizations as a space for dialogue and meeting for all countries in a spirit of mutual respect, and hinders the attainment of the sustainable development goals approved unanimously by the United Nations,"" the Pope said.
The Pope also said individual countries can no longer look out for their own people by themselves due to globalization.
""The nation-state is no longer able to procure the common good of its populations alone. The common good has become global and nations must associate for their own benefit,"" Francis said.
The Pope also pushed the idea of supranational entities to the conference. A supranational union is defined as a type of multinational political union where negotiated power is delegated to an authority by governments of member states. The term is sometimes used to describe the European Union, according to Wikipedia .
For instance, a group of nations could ""strengthen their cooperation by connecting certain functions and services to intergovernmental institutions that manage their common interests,"" he said.
""When a supranational common good is clearly identified, it is necessary to have a special authority that is legally and concordantly constituted and capable of facilitating its implementation,"" the Pope concluded."

He was friends with anyone and every one--a big, muscular guy with a huge heart.""
""He was the kind of person who you knew would take care of you the moment you met him, and he always did,"" the statement continued. ""He radiated love and always will. """
'The Real Answer Is Jesus': 400 Soldiers Find Hope in Christ as Non-Profit Offers Extreme Adventure,www.cbn.com,Talia Wise,05-06-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/the-real-answer-is-jesus-400-soldiers-find-hope-in-christ-as-non-profit-offers-extreme-adventure,"Active duty soldiers go through rigorous training to be able to fight on the front lines of combat, but despite that physical training, their spiritual well being is oftentimes overlooked and they can suffer in silence from things like post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression.
However, one non-profit is helping soldiers by getting them involved in extreme sports in order to share the message that true freedom and healing can be found in Christ.
Soul Survivor Outdoor hosts free outdoor adventure events like skydiving, rock-climbing, rappelling, and sailing to reach active duty military, veterans, and their families.
""You get people on the side of a rock or a mountain and it challenges them in ways that they aren't getting challenged in an office environment when they are going doing a normal day-to-day routine,"" Rick Wolf told CBN News.
Wolf is a retired Marine corp lieutenant colonel and the founder of Soul Survivor Outdoor.
He started the program after finding that deployed combat soldiers would return home battling serious problems like PTSD, suicide, and substance abuse.
""Whether we're talking about the veteran population or the active duty population we know that statistically, the suicide rates are not coming down,"" he explained. ""Depression, anxiety... these things are pretty significant in the society in general and the military is a cut of the cloth.""
Wolf said although there are programs to help veterans and even active duty soldiers manage these issues, most don't deal with the root cause.
""As Christians, we know the real answer is Jesus Christ,"" he added.
So, Wolf takes them off base and into the air or on top of a mountain to deal with real issues and lead them to the Lord.
The message he shares centers on finding your identity in Christ and it rings loud and clear in the hearts of these warriors.
""Your value as a human being whether you are in the military or someplace else is intrinsic because it comes from your Creator and not from your career, your status, or your phone or something else, but that you really have value,"" Wolf explained.
So far, more than 5,000 active duty soldiers have attended Soul Survivor Outdoor events, and last year, alone, 400 soldiers gave their lives to Christ.
Wolf believes the church is missing an opportunity to evangelize soldiers.
""Who more deserving to have the opportunity to receive the Gospel of Jesus Christ than this person that has the idea, and they may not even know where it comes from, that no greater love has someone than this to lay down their life for a friend,"" he said.
As 165,000 active duty soldiers have been deployed in more than 150 countries this year, Wolf says his organization has only begun to scratch the surface."
"It Looked Like a Pro-Trump Hate Crime, but It Wasn't - Arsonist Gets 10 Years for African American Church Fire",www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,05-06-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/it-looked-like-a-pro-trump-hate-crime-but-it-wasnt-arsonist-gets-10-years-for-african-american-church-fire,"A member of an African American church in Mississippi who admitted to setting a historic church building on fire was sentenced last week to 10 years in prison. But the man never took responsibility for painting the words ""Vote Trump"" on the outside of the building earlier the same night as the fire.
Both the fire and the vandalism at the Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church in Greenville occurred one week before the 2016 presidential election. It caused some local residents to fear the fire could have been a hate crime. The building was a total loss.
Andrew McClinton, of Leland, MS, pleaded guilty to setting the fire in March but did not admit to spray-painting the building beforehand. Circuit Judge Margaret Carey-McCray sentenced him to 10 years in prison for arson, along with a 10-year suspended sentence with some of the suspended sentence under state supervision.
Because of his previous felony convictions for attempted armed robbery in 1997 and armed robbery in 2004, both in another part of Mississippi, McClinton will not be eligible for early release.
Washington County District Attorney Dewayne Richardson told The Associated Press that McClinton was involved in ""illicit"" activities at the church and set the fire to prevent fellow congregants from meeting the next day to discuss the activities.
""He was trying to hide that information from being disclosed,"" Richardson said.
Greenville is located about 120 miles northwest of Jackson, MS. About 78% of the city's 32,100 residents are African American.
Founded in 1905 in the heart of an African American neighborhood, the Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church has a congregation of about 200 members. A new church building has been constructed in its place using some of the old church's walls."
"Blind Indian Pastor Finally Acquitted, but Christians Targeted 80 Times by Violent Mobs So Far This Year",www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,05-06-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/may/blind-indian-pastor-finally-acquitted-but-christians-targeted-80-times-by-violent-mobs-so-far-this-year,"A pastor's case took three years to be settled by an Indian court, but now his acquittal is being hailed as a triumph by Christian persecution watch groups.
In 2016, Pastor Balu Saste, his wife, and eleven other church members in the small village of Madhya Pradesh were violently attacked by a mob during church services. Local police arrested Balu (who is blind), his wife, and his six-year-old son, stripped them of their clothes, beat them, and kept them detained without bail for three days. They were also falsely charged with forcing conversions to Christianity and convicted.
ADF International , the global partner of US-based Alliance Defending Freedom, reports the landmark ruling marks an important victory against India's anti-conversion laws, which increasingly threaten the fundamental rights of religious minorities.
""Nobody should be persecuted because of their faith,"" Tehmina Arora, director of ADF India said in a press release. ""The acquittal of Pastor Balu and his family is a vital step towards the protection of religious freedom and the right to freely live out one's faith. Now he can continue to tend to his small community of Christians without interference from the state.""
""Unfortunately, this is not the only case in India where Christians have been falsely accused under anti-conversion laws,"" Arora added. ""These laws make religious minorities subject to arbitrary imprisonments and criminal charges, mob violence, and violations of their fundamental rights.""
ADF International also warns violence against Christians has risen significantly. In the first quarter of the year, the United Christian Forum and ADF India documented more than 80 violent mob attacks against Christians in 13 different states across India. The attacks often take a similar shape and rarely receive any police attention.
""The case of Pastor Balu provides a telling example of the injustices faced by many Christians in India,"" Paul Coleman, executive director of ADF International said in a press release. ""The important ruling in his case shows that the fundamental rights of religious minorities can and should be protected in the courtroom and through effective legal advocacy.""
""Sadly, the recent violence and mob attacks are not isolated incidents but testify to what many Christians experience in India today,"" he noted. ""All people have the right to freely choose, and live out their faith. We urge the Indian government to uphold this right and do more to protect religious minorities and promote religious freedom.""
For the first time, India is now listed in the Top Ten of countries on the World Watch List for the persecution of Christians."
Pope Pushes Idea of Global Authority at Vatican Nation-State Conference,www.cbn.com,Benjamin Gill and Steve Warren,05-07-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/may/pope-pushes-idea-of-global-authority-at-vatican-nation-state-conference-nbsp,"Pope Francis is pushing for a global authority that supersedes the rights of individual countries, all with the goal of pursuing the common good.
""Think of the great contemporary challenges of climate change, new slavery and peace,"" he told members of the Pontifical Academy.
They met last week at the Vatican to discuss the topic of: ""Nation, State, Nation-State.""
While addressing the conference, Francis rebuked the trend of nationalism among individual countries and the many tensions that ""come from an excessive demand for sovereignty,"" according to Breitbart.com .
However, the pope defended patriotism as a good thing. But he warned it can become perverted when ""it involves the exclusion and hatred of others when it becomes a conflictual nationalism that builds walls, indeed even racism or anti-Semitism.""
Francis also implied national sovereignty becomes twisted when countries do not have a welcoming attitude toward migrants.
""The Church observes with concern the reemergence, in many parts of the world, of currents that are aggressive towards foreigners, especially immigrants, as well as a growing nationalism that neglects the common good,"" he told the conference.
This, in turn, ""threatens to jeopardize consolidated forms of international cooperation, undermines the aims of international organizations as a space for dialogue and meeting for all countries in a spirit of mutual respect, and hinders the attainment of the sustainable development goals approved unanimously by the United Nations,"" the Pope said.
The Pope also said individual countries can no longer look out for their own people by themselves due to globalization.
""The nation-state is no longer able to procure the common good of its populations alone. The common good has become global and nations must associate for their own benefit,"" Francis said.
The Pope also pushed the idea of supranational entities to the conference. A supranational union is defined as a type of multinational political union where negotiated power is delegated to an authority by governments of member states. The term is sometimes used to describe the European Union, according to Wikipedia .
For instance, a group of nations could ""strengthen their cooperation by connecting certain functions and services to intergovernmental institutions that manage their common interests,"" he said.
""When a supranational common good is clearly identified, it is necessary to have a special authority that is legally and concordantly constituted and capable of facilitating its implementation,"" the Pope concluded."
