Read Caroline Bell's article on Briefings for Brexit. It looks as if May is planning to sign the 'Withdrawal Agreement' as an international treaty with the EU, possibly on April 10th. She will use executive authority, without reference to Parliament. It will then be irrelevant whether Parliament passes the Withdrawal Agreement or not. Presumably May thinks that if she can get away with extending Article 50 by executive order, she will get away with this as well. If this is what happens, then Robin Tilbrook's legal challenge to the extension of Article 50 will take on even greater significance."

Farage has always loathed le Pen

He softened a bit, opportunist as he is, when he thought she might win in France against Macron - that all.
He started his New business - oops party - to fight in the Euros if they took place.
His only motive must be to stop UKIP getting the seats to support Salvini etc ...and of course an ego trip and publicity.
Why would he not be trying to ween his mate Beppo from Nord if he really wants to spite the new Europe deal Salvini is setting up.
Supposition here.
Motive?
Oh Yes indeed.
His mate Bannon tried to do the same thing - remember.
And his 'movement' has flunked out to Salvinis.
Could it be that Farage has been tasked - or thinks he can gain - from wrecking the Salvini scheme for Bannon?
And how better to do it - than whisper to 5 star.
If I was your friends I would spare a moment to check what that stirrer may or may not have stirred - you never know.
The break up you say threatening is just too good for some people - to believe it couldn't have been engineered or tweaked

Giuliani: William Barr Summary of Mueller Report Is 'Going to Be 100% Accurate' | Breitbart,www.breitbart.com,richard verney,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/04/05/giuliani-william-barr-summary-of-mueller-report-is-going-to-be-100-accurate/#post-2,"Hannity is wrong with his opening summary (in the first 45 seconds) of the law.
In order to establish obstruction one of three types of conduct has to be established (presumably beyond all reasonable doubt), ie., namely (i) corrupt conduct, or (ii) the use of threats, or (iii) the use of force.
That is quite limited and specific, but the conduct does not have to be successful, it is sufficient that it ""endeavors to influence, obstruct or impede..."" Rudy Giuliani is therefore wrong, when he argues at 2:30, that the best evidence that there was no obstruction is that Mueller completed his investigation.
I, like most people commenting on here, have followed this very closely, and whilst the full facts are not known, from what I know, I consider the obstruction claim to be hopeless since President Trump was not corrupt in his dealings in relation to the Mueller inquiry, and I have seen nothing to suggest that President Trump used threats or force in relation to the Mueller investigation, the probe into Russian collusion/conspiracy.. As Rudy Giuliani points out, President trump saying 'I hope you can go easy on Flynn (or some such comment) is very far short of the use of threats or force. What would have been required is threatening statement along the lines 'go easy on Flynn or otherwise I will fire you'
Barr played a blinder keeping Rosenstein on, and making him part of the decision making process. Rosenstein could never claim that the firing Comey was obstruction since he recommended the firing of Comey and firing Comey was obstruction, it follows that Rosensteins letter recommending the firing would mean that Rosenstein himself committed obstruction. Further, of course, McCabe a few days after the firing of Comey in his testimony to Congress said that there had been no obstruction and that the FBI was perfectly capable of carrying on with the investigation without Comey had the head. ."

The Last Time a President Got a Pass on a Scandal-Plagued White House,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/06/calvin-coolidge-scandals-donald-trump-226576,"Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a writer and the eldest child of President Theodore Roosevelt, had it right when she said, “[Warren] Harding was not a bad man. He was just a slob.” Whether he knew it or not, the 29th president’s administration had been a ticking time bomb since the moment he won the presidency. He kept bad company, a group of friends and hangers-on who ran amok and enriched themselves on the Harding name. Some of the highest-profile American scandals, including Teapot Dome, happened under his watch. Sometimes he knew, sometimes he didn’t; sometimes he was a participant and other times guilty only by association. Regardless, Harding died in office on August 2, 1923, and the fact that he was still extremely popular and not yet a man in disgrace gave the Republicans a lifeline. Harding’s vice president and successor, Calvin Coolidge, seemed a nonentity. The Nation described him as a “midget statesman” and Alice Longworth popularized an observation from her doctor that Coolidge “look[ed] as if he had been weaned on a pickle.” Upon learning that Harding died, a number of senators responded with disbelief—Henry Cabot Lodge bellowed, “My God! That means Coolidge is president!” Peter Norbeck of South Dakota said Coolidge could “no more run this big machine at Washington than could a paralytic.” And Harold Ickes, the Chicago Republican who would later play a major role in Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, disparagingly observed, “If this country has reached the state where Coolidge is the right sort of a person for president, then any office boy is qualified to be chief executive.”
Story Continued Below
But Coolidge, despite all of these expectations, sailed through his first one-year term to a smooth election in 1924. While he may have been saddled with his predecessor’s scandals, the public was more interested in enjoying the prosperity that he had also inherited. Distancing himself from the scandals and associating himself with that prosperity proved a winning strategy for Coolidge during both his campaign and his presidency. The Republican Party’s reputation did not appear to suffer from the scandals, either. In fact, it wasn’t until the stock market crash of 1929 that voters started to turn against the party.
The circumstances that allowed Coolidge’s political survival and the smooth sailing of the entire Republican Party are worth revisiting today as a different scandal-plagued president—albeit one who, unlike Coolidge, is reaping the whirlwind of his own scandals—looks to win a second term during relatively prosperous times.
***
It was only a matter of weeks into his term before Coolidge suspected that trouble was brewing. It took just three months from the time of Harding’s funeral for the scandals to break. The first to explode was the Veterans’ Bureau, which during Harding’s time had wielded an enormous amount of influence with a $500 million budget and 30,000 jobs to dish out. Its previous secretary, Charles Forbes, had been involved in a lucrative kickback scheme in which he pillaged his own department to spruce up his ranch. Terrified of the embarrassment this could mean for the administration, Harding quietly asked Forbes to resign and then asked him to leave for Europe, from where he resigned, so as not to attract attention. The plan was not entirely successful, however, as details began to trickle out, which resulted in a Senate investigation of Forbes on March 2, 1923. But like all things, the coverup is sometimes as bad as the crime, and Harding must have been deeply concerned that the Senate would learn he had pushed the scandal under the rug. The Senate spent six months gathering facts and finished just at the time Harding died. Three months later, Forbes returned from Europe to stand trial. He was convicted and sentenced to a $10,000 fine and two years in prison.
The Forbes scandal was a hiccup, but not an insurmountable challenge for Coolidge. Harding had done enough and justice had been served, so the president could tell a story of accountability and move on so long as it remained an isolated incident. Unfortunately, it didn’t.
The next shoe to drop was Teapot Dome, which until Watergate would be considered the greatest political scandal in U.S. history. The scandal centered around three oilfields that in 1909 had been legally allocated to the United States Navy—a safeguard against possible shortage of oil in time of emergency. They were Naval Reserve No.1, at Elk Hills, California; No. 2, at Buena Vista, California; and No. 3, at Teapot Dome, Wyoming.

Harding’s interior secretary, Albert Fall, had his own plan and had persuaded Harding to transfer authority over the reserves to his department. Rather than receive competing bids for the leases of the reserves, he would sole-source the leases under a national security justification. He would then lease the three reserves to three separate friends with terms that were disproportionately favorable to the oil companies. The punch line of Fall’s scheme was that by making the oil companies richer, he would earn kickbacks in the form of no-interest loans, Liberty Bonds, livestock and cash that would make him a very rich man. Fall would then retire from government and use the money to build out his Three Rivers Ranch in New Mexico.
When the scandal emerged, Coolidge, who had heard whisperings while serving as vice president, quickly understood the implications of Teapot Dome but didn’t realize in the initial months of his presidency that the scandal went all the way up to his predecessor. He just knew he had some shady characters in the Cabinet and some housecleaning was in order. The former Interior secretary was damaged goods, and it was becoming increasingly clear that both the Navy secretary and the attorney general were equally complicit. He would deal with these individuals, but he needed to simultaneously ensure that any further investigation remained bipartisan so as not to taint him or the Republican Party going into the election.
The appointment of a bipartisan commission was a stroke of political genius. It implicated both Democrats and Republicans and achieved the more important goal of playing for time as the various trials dragged out long enough to avoid impact on the election. That June, the commission called for the prosecution of Fall and his cronies, but most convictions and subsequent sentencing occurred after the election. By that point, the public had largely lost interest and moved on. Albert Fall was less fortunate, as he earned the distinction of being the first Cabinet secretary in U.S. history to serve prison time.
The third major scandal to break—this time at the Department of Justice—had the most sweeping implications for Harding’s legacy and was potentially the most threatening to Coolidge’s election prospects. Attorney General Harry Daugherty was a shady, crooked individual who abused his office repeatedly and unabashedly for personal gain. He personally ran a bootlegging operation in which his henchmen accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from bootleggers in exchange for immunity, which was not always granted.
Daugherty also ran the Justice Department as a ruthless tyrant and drew the ire of many enemies. As attorney general, he obstructed justice, most notably during the Teapot Dome investigations. When, on February 20, 1924, Montana Senator Burton Wheeler introduced a resolution specifically calling for an investigation of the attorney general, Daugherty responded—or at least the FBI chief did on his behalf—by harassing him both publicly and privately. As Wheeler pursued the investigation, witnesses were physically intimidated, had their rooms ransacked and their documents stolen, all with the goal of preventing them from testifying. When that failed to halt Wheeler, Daugherty manufactured bribery charges against him in his home state of Montana.
Daugherty’s misdeeds eventually caught up with him and while he escaped prosecution—mainly because some of the key figures had mysteriously died or committed suicide—Coolidge had had enough. Harding may have been blinded by loyalty, but Coolidge knew exactly who Daugherty was and pushed him out on March 28, 1924.
By mid-1924, Coolidge was forced to confront the undeniable truth behind many of the accusations, particularly the suggestion that senior members of the Cabinet had been deeply involved. This was a dilemma for the new president, who in addition to having been at least nominally part of Harding’s Cabinet had retained his advisors. So much had unfolded in just his first few months as president and now, with the 1924 presidential election fast approaching, Coolidge knew he had to distance himself from his predecessor. Harding had been good to him, but the scandals occurred on his watch, and it was much easier for a dead man’s head to roll.
With Harding unable to defend himself and those responsible for the many scandals hardly eager to out themselves, Coolidge didn’t wait long to throw his dead predecessor under the bus. It was a good strategy. Not only did he get a free pass on the scandals, but the more the press and some politicians attempted to connect him and his administration to the past, the more unpopular such opponents became. Perhaps the greatest victim was John W. Davis, the 1924 Democratic presidential nominee, who foolishly misread the public and tried to connect Coolidge to the Harding scandals. He paid a heavy political price at a time when the electorate found this in poor taste.
Coolidge didn’t have to lift a finger to win the 1924 presidential election with the second-largest popular vote in Republican history. It was fortunate, too, as the unexpected death of his son left him too emotionally distraught to campaign. But as William Allen White observed: “In a fat and happy world, Coolidge is the man of the hour. Why tempt fate by opposing him.” His ascension to the presidency in 1923 fulfilled the country’s desire for a return to normalcy, making for an easy case to the American people that they should “Keep It Cool with Coolidge” and vote for a continuation of prosperity—even as scandal after scandal was continuing to land on the morning newspapers.
***
If the Coolidge presidency seemed uneventful, it’s because it was. He bickered a bit with Congress, but by and large he sat back and let the good times roll. The country, intoxicated with the perks of prosperity, mortgaged its future at every level as it marched blindly toward the greatest economic catastrophe in history.
Meanwhile, the late president lay six feet underground and was saddled with the growing reputational damage that came with each new revelation. When it came time to dedicate his memorial on July 4, 1927, President Coolidge was “too busy,” lest he risk any association with his radioactive predecessor. Nan Britton’s publication of The President’s Daughter dealt the dead president a devastating blow as she detailed their torrid affair in 440 pages of salacious anecdotes of sex and scandal. Successive biographies and autobiographies followed, each deepening the narrative of Harding’s failure. In many respects, Warren Harding became a lightning rod for the Republican Party. All that was bad was attributed to the late president, while all that was good and prosperous could be associated with Republican policies.
Harding was undoubtedly flawed and a failure of a president, but his death was exploited in the most Machiavellian terms by the very political opportunists he had elevated. Harding was corrupt, but so were many others in the Republican Party. His tragic death probably saved the party from implosion by giving it a fall guy. Had he survived, it all would have exploded just as he was gearing up for reelection, and unlike Coolidge he would have had no way to escape. There were simply too many scandals involving too many cronies and public servants, and had he not died it is unlikely he would have finished his term in office.
Not only did Coolidge not suffer the political consequences of his predecessor’s scandals, but the prosperous times similarly insulated the entire party against voters’ discontent—at least until the end of the decade.

It was tempting for Coolidge to consider a run in 1928, and at the time the country was so prosperous that he probably could have won. The 1920s was the Republican era, a period in which the prosperity was so great that it overshadowed the man in the White House. The party cared little if the president was Calvin Coolidge or Herbert Hoover, so long as he was Republican and the party could build on its political endowment. Little did they know that this political endowment was resting on a far shakier foundation than they realized. The approach was nearsighted, and as the writer Henry “H.L.” Mencken observed at the time, “[Coolidge’s] chief feat during five years and seven months in office was to sleep more than any other President—to sleep more and say less … While he yawned and stretched the United States went slam-bang down the hill—and he lived just long enough to see it fetch up with a horrible bump at the bottom.”
Harding, Coolidge and Hoover had all been architects of the policy that put American business first. Each bears responsibility for rebuffing demands to regulate the financial sector and for permitting rampant stock market speculation. Both the financial sector and the stock market were in dire need of regulation, and we know in hindsight that the trickle-down effect of booming economic times had created a bubble that was ready to burst. The success of the economy was in fact widening income inequality and further depressing the persisting agricultural crises. In truth, it all could have come crashing down during any one of the three presidents’ administrations. But by a stroke of bad luck and opting into a continuation of the same policies, Herbert Hoover was left holding the bag and to navigate the impossible.
Hoover’s election in 1928 was seen as a vote for prosperity, and by all accounts he had the right pedigree to continue the momentum. As a star member of both the Harding and Coolidge Cabinets, in which he served as Commerce secretary, Hoover distinguished himself as both a savvy and competent executive. With the country’s economy continuing to boom and a nasty anti-Catholic campaign targeted at the Democratic nominee, Al Smith, Hoover had an easy time winning in a massive landslide that even flipped some Democratic, Southern states.
The celebration was short-lived. Less than a year after taking office, calamity hit. As the market crashed in October 1929, so too did the Republican era of good and plenty.

Teach For America — except for California,www.politico.com,MACKENZIE MAYS,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2019/04/06/teach-for-america-except-for-california-955316,"SACRAMENTO — Backed by powerful teachers unions, Democrats are pushing to ban Teach For America from California amid a wave of teacher’s strikes and a heated debate over charter schools in the nation’s most populous state. The push comes as education policy becomes an increasing point of tension, putting the national nonprofit and its recruits — promising college grads eager to teach in poor communities — in the crosshairs of the state's supermajority Democratic legislature.
Story Continued Below
Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens), a Democrat in the state Assembly pushing legislation to ban the nearly 30-year-old organization in the state, says Teach For America’s goal of closing the achievement gap in public education actually hurts the poor and minority students it seeks to serve.
Teach For America fast-tracks teacher training for ambitious young people straight out of college and places them in the country’s most struggling school districts, committing them to a two-year teaching stint.
“Our most vulnerable students are getting our least trained teachers. If they’re good enough for poor, low-income schools, why aren’t they good enough for the Beverly Hillses of the world?” Garcia told POLITICO. “Why do low-income schools have to be the guinea pigs?”
It doesn’t help that during a recent teacher strike in Oakland — which followed a teacher walkout in Los Angeles and garnered support from national figures ranging from NBA star Stephen Curry to Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) —Teach For America seemed to encourage its California members to cross picket lines, prompting a backlash from its alumni.
It’s far from the first time Teach For America, which has enjoyed support on Capitol Hill , has faced resistance. In 2016, San Francisco school board members voted down what would have been a routine approval of TFA teachers, citing concerns similar to Garcia’s. In 2013, a group of Teach for America alumni organized in Chicago to speak out against the organization they once took part in, saying they had felt unprepared to help the students they were put in charge of.
More broadly, states including Minnesota and Nevada have resisted efforts to expand TFA’s presence in their schools over the years, backed by unions who say the corps members do not compare to traditionally trained teachers.
In California, unions have long opposed what they call “quick fix” programs, and both the California Federation of Teachers and the California Teachers Association voiced support for the Garcia bill in a preliminary hearing in late March — the first sign that the unlikely legislation has legs.
The stakes are higher now, says Matthew Hardy, spokesman for the California Federation of Teachers, pointing to momentum built by teachers across the state demanding lower class sizes, better salaries and more support staff. Sacramento teachers announced Tuesday that they, too, plan to walk out next week.
“Every student deserves a highly qualified teacher, and Teach For America placements get five weeks of training. There’s no way that’s high quality,” Hardy said. “I think that people across the country are finally really taking a look at public education and the need to fully invest in it. We need to invest more in teachers, and make sure we bring people into the profession and keep them there. This is the opposite of that. … From West Virginia to Oklahoma to L.A., what you’re seeing is teachers standing up and saying enough is enough.”
Lawmakers who so far support the California bill insist that it’s not banning the organization from the state. New amendments to CA AB221 (19R) remove any specific mention of the organization, but would prohibit school districts from hiring teachers via third-party organizations for less than a five-year commitment at low-income schools — regulations that are contrary to the cornerstones of TFA.
More than 700 TFA members are currently in California classrooms.
“It would gut us, and our mission,” Lida Jennings, executive director of Teach For America Los Angeles, told POLITICO.
The competitive program, which has a 15 percent acceptance rate, does not require its members to have a background in education. Instead, it puts high-achievers through at least five weeks of a summer training program before placing them in a classroom.
Proponents of the national nonprofit say that it boosts learning in communities that need the most help, including schools in Mississippi, Chicago and New Orleans. Nearly half of TFA’s do-gooder recruits are people of color, a fact that the organization touts given that the national teacher workforce is predominantly white.
But critics say the program is a Band-Aid for problems like teacher shortages and high turnover rates that can only be solved by people who plan to make teaching their life’s work; many view TFA recruits as more likely to use the experience as a resume-builder for other careers.
And the bill comes at a time when California unions are pushing for another alternative approach to education to be put on the chopping block: charter schools. About a third of Teach For America members work in charter schools — a fact that concerns critics who say that corps members often leave the program with ideas about education reform that hurt traditional public schools, or move on to start their own charters.
Moreover, TFA teachers have been influential in education policy overhaul efforts that have opened public schools to private competition.
TFA’s association with charter schools could be a death sentence in California, where union-backed Democrats have introduced legislation that aims to not only curb the growth of the schools, but also crack down on how they’re regulated, citing concerns that they are plagued by financial mismanagement because they don’t have to abide by the same rules as traditional schools.
Gov. Gavin Newsom, who took office in January, recently signed into law legislation that would require new transparency standards in the administration of charter schools. During his campaign for governor, Newsom was supported by teachers unions and highly criticized by the California Charter Schools Association, who endorsed his opponent, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.
TFA says it does not prefer charter schools to traditional schools, and that members wind up there because charters are often located in the low-income communities that are the program’s focus.
Jennings said the organization’s affiliation with the charter school movement is misguided, and that the timing of the bill is no coincidence.
“I think this has a lot to do with the fact that we tend to be inappropriately and inaccurately associated with organizations or movements that are privatizing education, that folks think could be a threat to public education,” she said.
Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin), the only Republican on the California Assembly Education Committee, was the lone “no” vote on the bill at its first hearing in late March. A TFA alumnus, Kiley called the bill unconstitutional.
Debate over the legislation led to a heated exchange between Kiley and the Democratic Assembly Education Committee Chair, Patrick O’Donnell. A former teacher, O'Donnell said Teach For America benefits the adults in the program more than it does the students they teach.
“They’re using this as a resume-builder because they want to go on to some elite grad school or law school,” O’Donnell said.
Following the hearing, Kiley’s office was moved to a smaller room known as “the dog house,” after he said Speaker Anthony Rendon cussed him out on the Assembly floor for his comments criticizing the Democrats in support of the bill.
When asked for comment, Rendon’s office simply said that the speaker has the authority to determine office assignments. ""No assembly member is guaranteed a particular office,” a spokesperson told POLITICO.
TFA, which has called the bill an “unenforceable, misguided, legislative overreach,” points to people like Marcus Hughes.
Hughes, 39, trains teachers in needy communities in L.A. and had just graduated with a business degree when he joined TFA in 2003 to teach for the first time in an Atlanta school.
He hasn’t left education since.
“I wouldn’t have entered a classroom had it not been for Teach For America. Since then, my whole life has been about education,” he said. “They find the right people that want to be there, who have the right mindsets and come in and work hard.”"

The two men presented themselves to officers at a police station in the commune of Angoulême in south-west France earlier this week with both claiming that they were 16-years-old in order to take advantage of measures aimed at helping underage asylum seekers Charente Libre reports .
One of the men, who claimed to be from the African nation of Mali, was revealed to be 21 years old, while the other man, who presented police with a birth certificate from Guinea, was revealed to be 47 years old, after his fingerprints were connected to a passport he had used to enter Spain.
French Police Bust Network of Identity Fraud Fake Underage Migrants https://t.co/Ob6atpxNYS
— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 9, 2018
The department of Charente, where Angoulême is located, has seen a surge in asylum claims from alleged minor migrants and, as a result, has managed to develop relationships and sharing of information with several different countries to determine the veracity of the claims.
The problem of fake underage migrants in France was highlighted last year when police in Montpellier managed to bust a network from the Ivory Coast who were forging documents in order to help adult migrants claim asylum as minors.
Prosecutor of the Republic of Montpellier, Christophe Barret noted similar age exaggerations to the men in Angoulême saying, “Recently, an isolated minor supported by the county council of Hérault had said he was 17 years old. The department had doubts. Extensive verifications have formally confirmed that he was 32 years old, in fact.”
86 Per Cent of Recently Tested ‘Underage’ Migrants in Sweden Are Actually Adults https://t.co/DX9UW4Xu6Y
— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 7, 2017
In total, the migrants who used the forged documents were able to defraud French taxpayers to the sum of nearly a million euros in benefits they were not qualified for.
In other countries, there have also been prevalent cases of adults pretending to be children, such as in Germany where almost half of the underage migrants , 49 percent, in the city of Hamburg were shown to be adults in 2017.
The German national average was 43 percent.
