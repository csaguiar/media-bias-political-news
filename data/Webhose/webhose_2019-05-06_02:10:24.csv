We are counted as sheep to the slaughter. All who will live Godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. If the world hate us, know that it hated Him first.

He will in no wise cast out those whom He foreknew.

Yes, the outrage over Trump slandering a yarmulka with his name has never been seen before! This obscene sacrilegious blasphemy is unprecedented! No politician has ever done such a disrespectful–…
Uh oh. Before you buy into the outrage, reflect on whether there's been outrage in the past for the same thing. #yarmulka pic.twitter.com/91rRO7Y2QG

So just to reiterate — we see examples of numerous Democratic candidates with their versions of yarmulkas as far back as 2008. Interesting that we had no similar hue and cry in that duration.
More than that, if you want to know just how convenient this Trump-Yarmulka raging is today, note this non-outrage taking place over a vendor at AIPAC three years ago.

He was selling the head covering with all of the potential Presidential candidates and was noting how the names he was selling trended. The Washington Free Beacon covered this controversial practice that nobody seemed to find controversial.
“I totally underestimated the degree of support that Jewish people who are attending this event have for Trump,” said Daniels, who runs an online yarmulke shop called Marc’s Garden Jubilee. “I probably had about 50 inquiries for Trump yarmulkes that I could not fulfill.”
So today the President is accused of being religiously insensitive, for doing the exact same thing that has been done repeatedly over the last few elections? What a difference a few years can make."

We are disappointed that false information is being reported as fact.”
As Breitbart News reported this week, ESPN’s Nick DePaula claimed that Beyoncé abruptly left a meeting because the room was not sufficiently diverse.
“She had a meeting at Reebok and they had a whole presentation of everything, potential products, how this could all look, and she kind of took a step back and said, ‘Is this the team that will be working on my product?'” DePaula said on the show The Jump .
“Somebody said, ‘Yes,’ and she said, ‘Nobody in this room reflects by background, my skin color and where I’m from and what I want to do.’ So she took a step back and left and then it did not come to terms,” DePaula said.

BTS Fans React to 'Boy With Luv' Teaser Featuring Halsey: 'I Am In Shock',www.newsweek.com,Hannah Preston,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/bts-fans-react-boy-luv-teaser-halsey-i-am-shock-1388311,"On 4/7/19 at 1:21 PM EDT Share Culture
Mega-hit K-Pop group BTS released a teaser Sunday of their upcoming new song ""Boy With Luv."" The clip, a hair over 45 seconds long, featured a familiar face from American pop royalty: ""Without Me"" singer Halsey.
The teaser opens up with the 24-year-old, wearing pink and peach hues, sitting in a ticket booth. As Halsey closes up for the night, with a lollipop in hand, she walks past the K-Pop boy band. She makes eye contact with every member of BTS, except for one: Jimin. As the American singer continues to walk past and offscreen, the teaser fades to black and fans catch a quick glimpse of the song's vocals.
While most BTS fans simply voiced their excitement and ""shock"" on social media, others were already trying to suss out the larger implications of the teaser video.
One heavily speculated-upon moment comes toward the end of the clip, where it appears that one BTS member is facing forward while the others have their backs to the camera. Their silhouettes are the only things seen within the clip, but fans began hypothesizing the identity and underlying meaning of this brief glimpse.
""What if it’s Jimin because, in the part of the teaser where Halsey walks next to them sitting on the couch, Jimin was the only one not looking at her,"" Twitter user @SMoreira93 noted.
""For me, the hairstyle and gesture just scream JIMIN,"" another Twitter user added.
Some fans have concluded that this could be a song that will reveal a BTS member's sexual orientation. The question of whether any members of the K-Pop sensation identify as gay or bisexual has been a topic of recent discussion. Some fans believe that Halsey's involvement in the song could be a clear hint, while also drawing back on BTS's ""Persona"" trailer and the colors behind Namjoon, possibly referencing the bisexual flag.
Halsey openly identifies as bi-sexual and fans have also begun to hypothesize that the member who turns around at the conclusion of the clip is the ""Boy With Luv."" bts' collab with halsey a BISEXUAL artist and this?? a coincidence? i think not. #BoyWithLuv pic.twitter.com/aQFx4nuC64 — Joon's World _ (@kimparkdaily) April 7, 2019
""Boy With Luv"" isn't the first time Halsey and BTS have crossed paths. Back in August, the American singer posted a series of pictures to her Twitter account with the K-Pop group. In the wake of the ""Boy With Luv"" teaser, BTS fans believe their collaborative work started back in 2018. you know there was no way I’d come all the way to Seoul without seeing these guys. __ can’t wait to see them play Staples center!!! I’m HELLA proud. ___ @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/RF4vqE9G0J — h (@halsey) August 7, 2018
""They really planned this from a long time,"" Twitter user @almastyles26 noted.
One thing fans can be confident about is that nothing is a coincidence when it comes to BTS. Hopefully, answers to fans' theories will come when the song officially drops Friday at 5 p.m. ET. "

Medicare for All Critics Are Telling Lies,jacobinmag.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://jacobinmag.com/2019/04/medicare-for-all-health-care-churn,"Medicare for All Critics Are Telling Lies By Matt Bruenig One of the most common myths about the US health system is that if you like your insurance, you can keep it. But millions of people are thrown off their employer-based coverage every year — so the only solution is Medicare for All. Supporters hold signs as US Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks during a health care rally at the 2017 Convention of the California Nurses Association/National Nurses Organizing Committee on September 22, 2017 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan / Getty
Our new issue, on what a President Bernie Sanders could actually do in office, is out now. Subscribe today to receive it !
Nancy Pelosi said this about Medicare for All the other day:
“When most people say they’re for Medicare-for-all, I think they mean health care for all. Let’s see what that means. A lot of people love having their employer-based insurance and the Affordable Care Act gave them better benefits,” said Pelosi, who shepherded the ACA through Congress in 2009 and 2010 in her first speakership.
The bolded part is probably the most dishonest argument in the entire Medicare for All debate. It implies that, under our current health insurance system, people who like their employer-based insurance can hold onto it. This then is contrasted with a Medicare for All transition where people will lose their employer-based insurance as part of being shifted over to an excellent government plan. But the truth is that people who love their employer-based insurance do not get to hold onto it in our current system. Instead, they lose that insurance constantly, all the time, over and over again. It is a complete nightmare.
I have illustrated this point previously by showing just how often people switch jobs. The latest JOLTS data shows that, in 2018, 66.1 million workers separated from their job at some point. And longitudinal data from BLS shows that the average worker has 11.9 different jobs by the time they are fifty. This labor turnover data leaves little doubt that people with employer-sponsored insurance are losing that insurance constantly, as are their spouses and kids.
But we don’t need to indirectly surmise this fact from labor turnover data. A study from the University of Michigan tracked insurance churn directly by surveying Michiganders in 2014 about their health insurance situation and then following up with survey participants twelve months later. The amount of insurance churn they picked up was even higher than I would have imagined.
Among those who had employer-sponsored insurance in 2014, only 72 percent were continuously enrolled in that insurance for the next twelve months. This means that 28 percent of people on an employer plan were not on that same plan one year later. You like your employer health plan? You better cross your fingers because one in four people on employer plans will come off their plan in the next twelve months.
The situation is even worse for other kinds of insurance. One thing opponents of Medicare for All frequently say is that poor people in the US are already covered by free insurance in the form of Medicaid and that Medicare for All therefore offers them relatively little net benefit while potentially raising their taxes some. But what this argument misses, among other things, is that people on Medicaid churn off it frequently, with many churning into un-insurance.
According to the Michigan researchers, a whopping 30 percent of Michiganders on Medicaid in 2014 faced a spell of un-insurance in the twelve months after they were initially interviewed. Medicaid is a godsend for many, but it’s wildly unstable coverage, and that’s even in a state where the GOP is not doing everything it can to kick people off the Medicaid rolls.
As with many things in current US politics, the divide of opinion on whether Medicare for All is a good idea is heavily generational. Young people are for it. Old people are more skeptical. This age gap is probably mostly driven by ideological differences between the generations: the current crop of young people is much more left-wing than the current crop of old people. But there may also be an objective material basis for this divide. In this Michigan survey, 47 percent of adults aged eighteen to twenty-four churned off their insurance plan during the twelve-month survey span. Only 18 percent of adults fifty-six or older did.
It is easy therefore to see why young people are not as spooked by the idea of losing their current insurance as part of the transition to a Medicare for All system: half of them already lose their insurance every single year. Although older people have it somewhat better, it is worth emphasizing that their churn is still unacceptably high with nearly one in five of them churning off their insurance every year.
Critics of Medicare for All are right to point out that losing your insurance sucks. But the only way to stop that from happening to people is to create a seamless system where people do not constantly churn on and off of insurance. Medicare for All offers that. Our current system offers the exact opposite. If you like losing your insurance all the time, then our current health care system is the right one for you. If you like having permanent coverage no matter your life situation, then you should want Medicare for All. End Mark "

Trump has called to end foreign aid to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras over the flow of migrants from the countries moving toward the U.S.
Critics, however, have said aid cuts are unlikely to achieve their desired effect.
“It may make the lives of these individuals even worse and thus encourage more of them to flee the countries that they are now leaving,” Sen. Susan Collins Susan Margaret Collins McConnell pledges to be 'Grim Reaper' for progressive policies Senate Republicans tested on Trump support after Mueller Collins: Mueller report includes 'an unflattering portrayal' of Trump MORE (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said last week. “So I’d actually like to see the president consider a different approach, an opposite approach.”
Trump last week backed down on his threats to close the southern border, saying he would give Mexico a ""one-year warning"" to stop the flow of drugs into the U.S."
How the Deep State Stole our Brexit Democracy,www.bruceonpolitics.com,Bruce,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.bruceonpolitics.com/2019/04/07/how-the-deep-state-stole-our-brexit-democracy/,"1
Quintus Fabius Maximum was the Roman general who defeated Hannibal. Not by meeting him in open battle but by wearing him down with endless skirmishes. What today would be called guerrilla tactics. The Romans called him Cunctator, which translates to mean delayer. And the British socialist organisation the Fabian Society is named after him. They seek to destroy capitalism and democracy by guerrilla tactics. It is oxymoronic to describe socialists as being capable of thought. But if they were then in Britain the Fabian Society is where it would happen. They work hand in glove with Common Purpose and the Tavistock Institute to create an unholy Deep State that has largely replaced our democracy.
Delaying tactics and guerrilla warfare are what the Deep State has used to overthrow our democratic decision to prefer freedom to continued membership of the corrupt, undemocratic EU superstate. Here is how they have done it:
Step 1. Cameron Resigns . He had told us repeatedly that if Leave won the referendum then he would immediately declare Article 50, the mechanic by which countries leave the EU. This allows a MAXIMUM of two years before final departure. So the UK, if we believed Cameron’s promises, would exit the EU on 24 June 2018 at the LATEST. But instead of signing Article 50 he resigned. Which looks like a blatant tactic to delay or even prevent giving us what we voted for. Presumably the Deep State ordered him to do this.
Step 2. Conservative Leadership Stitch Up. This contest came down to a straight choice between a committed Leave candidate, Andrea Leadsom and a committed Remain candidate, Theresa May. This should have gone to a vote by all the party members in the country. But it didn’t. Mysteriously Leadsom withdrew from the contest and May was anointed party leader and thus Prime Minister. And so we had someone in charge of Brexit who was totally committed to keeping us in the EU.
Step 3. Using the Legal System as a Political Tool. Gina Miller fronted an action, using the courts, which meant that Article 50 could not be signed. Who paid all the legal costs? A government appeal added further delays. This took us to January 2017.
Step 4. Parliamentary Delay. Ordered by the courts. We had been told repeatedly that Brexit was the choice of the British people, not of Parliament and that our wished would be carried out. Article 50 was finally invoked on 29 March 2017. A full 9 months after we were promised.
Step 5. Call a General Election. Theresa May seemingly tried to lose this one by announcing that she would inflict new higher taxes on pensioners. A dementia tax. The Deep State knew that the Labour Manifesto was for Brexit in Name Only (BRINO) which would leave us in many EU institutions, but without any say in their running.
Step 6. The Surrender Document. May, Tusk, Barnier and Robbins concocted an “agreement” that would obviously be totally unacceptable to the British public. Effectively we give away Northern Ireland, our fisheries and Gibraltar. And we are to pay the EU £39 billion in reparations. It is as if we lost World War Two. So of course the House of Commons has rejected it three times.
Step 7. Brexit Delay to 22 May. Supposedly two months in which our government can get the agreement of Parliament. Theresa May had told us many hundreds of times that such an extension would never happen.
Step 8. The Yvette Balls Bill . This was rushed through Parliament with indecent haste. It reverses our democratic Brexit vote by denying us a Clean Brexit. Mrs Windsor should not sign this. She should do her constitutional duty to protect the constitution and the British people by preventing this becoming law.
Step 9. Further, Indefinite Article 50 Extensions . Yes, we have been comprehensively stitched up. We are not going to get what we voted for . We are no longer a democracy. The Deep State has won.
We, the British people, have been lied to and deceived by our politicians and the BBC on a previously unimaginable scale. Our vote now counts for nothing. We are on the road to slavery. Related"

And while I realize that Red Ice wasn’t saying you SHOULDN’T marry outside your race, is she (and you for that matter), okay with just letting it happen without pushing for it OR against it? My family is about as white and American as you can get, being from Scottish and Scandinavian stock, with ancestors who fought in the Seven Years War, Revolutionary War, were Great Plains pioneers…the works. But when my brother married a South Korean, we didn’t care that she was another race, and as far as I’m concerned, anyone who has a problem with his wife and kids has a problem with me.
And so would they have with me if they intended some sort of harm against them.
But one has to back up here:
There are a few levels that have to be considered. One (the more relevant one) is to entertain the possibility of a social engineering project brought against Whites , or as as it is expressed ‘against whiteness’. In my own researches I trace this back to what a recent poster has called Agit-Prop. Literally, the influence and undertakings of Communist-oriented persons who operated in the US (and many other places). You can use the term ‘Cultural Marxism’, or simple ‘Marxism’, but the important thing is to understand how it works. This involves a research project (as does understanding all important topics and problems). One either does this oneself or relies on those one trusts (that is a problem right there).
To understand ‘the Sixties’ and a new American Radicalism — these are the influences that have shaped our present and now are seen as fruits diaboliques of our present, one has to trace all of it back! It is maddening and not at all easy! You will either come to have an ‘answer’ that might oppose it, or you will realize that you are a part of it and do not, not really, oppose it. You have to have, or you have to be in the process of developing, an ideological framework to oppose Sixties Radicalism.
In my own view, to have an ideological position that could fairly, ethically, and rationally oppose race-mixing and also culture-mixing, one would have to establish a foundation for a larger, more general view. But, since the general idea more or less ‘floating around’ is one of unconcern about many different things that are going on, the average person is (I use this term) a ‘victim’ of choices made by others, not the engineer of his or her own choices. This describes our highly propagandized culture, the most propagandized culture that has ever existed on the planet. We are subsumed in it and by it.
There are — indeed there are — mean-spirited racist people. True ‘bigots’. But the people that I read are not such as these. They are mostly opposed to a far larger ‘engineering project’ that has been brought to bear on all of us, no matter your color or culture. True, they do point out that European culture, Whites and ‘whiteness’ are definitely under attack, and they see this as nefarious and ultimately terrifyingly destructive to Occidental Civilization (and there they draw a link to Marxian projects of undermining Occidental structures: an idea-war in essence). But they also point out that a general cultural blending plan will not work out well for other cultures, ethnicities and ‘races’.
Therefore, what they end up defining is an anti-liberalism (an anti-hyper-liberalism would be my term) that is pro-sovereignty. They are forced to contest the ‘democratic model’ when that model becomes active and hyper-liberalist (then tends to totalitarian) because they see, more or less, where it is tending. Yet they struggle to define a coherent oppositional platform because, well, it is not at all easy.
The first order of business is to get clear about ‘what is going on in our present’. It is a project of categorization and discrimination. Are you comfortable that elites in government, in culture, and in business, have chosen to deliberately dilute the demographics of the US by lifting controls? Are you comfortable that in just a decade, perhaps a bit more, you will no longer have ‘super-majority status’ and, further on, that you will be a minority? If you cannot oppose this with a coherent, ethically-based argument, then you must be willing to live the consequences of your choices.
Are you aware that they say ‘Sweden has been lost’? Are you aware that when the demographics mathematics is plotted out that in Britain, just a few years down the line, Muslims will begin to outnumber indiginous British whites? Are you aware that this means the cultural and religious supplanting of Britain? Are you aware that Islam does not have any concern for nor does it value any of the defined areas of Occidental value? That they will murder the West’s beloved gays. That they will sexually modify their girls and women as is done (sixty to eighty percent I have read) in Egypt? Are you comfortable with that? Because that is what you will choose if you do not oppose.
Therefore, I simply say to begin to examine the larger issues from a meta-political perspective. Just that word alone, dropped into Google, will reveal all sort of information.
…as I’m concerned, anyone who has a problem with his wife and kids has a problem with me.
One has to refer to a meta-political perspective in order to define an overall position . If you cannot define, as I suggest, a position that could oppose a larger example (a consequential example) of cultural invasion (Islamic invasion of Europe), then you might not be able to resist it. Because you could not establish an initial argument to oppose it. You would be malleable and indecisive.
The initial argument would also, as we know, include ‘social attitude’ or ‘social restrictions’. If you and anyone else cannot bring together inside of yourself, as a manifestation of your ethics and your morals, a position that would allow you to defend yourself against race-mixing and cultural dilution when it is established as a social value (and instituted by Agit-Prop and PR campaigns with government backing; or financed, for example, by NGOs and other perhaps private interests with dubious political intentions); if you cannot come up with an argument against this that is rational and fair (and ethical), then you will not oppose these. You will have no ground to. You have no other choice but to ‘go with the established flow’.
These issues are ‘meta-political’. The dimensions and the ramifications of these questions are huge indeed, and consequential.
If you asked me , I would say “In my opinion it is best if people would examine the larger, molding forces that ‘engineer’ us and seek to mold us into an economic mass to whom they can sell products. A people to be a people, and to be strong as a people, need to hold to and protect their cultural, social, philosophical and religious — and their physical — identity and integrity. It would likely be best if people were to choose to marry and reproduce within their cultural and racial groups, and empower other groups and peoples to a) think similarly and b) do the same. Because in this way ‘diversity’ will in fact be maintained. That is, if ‘diversity’ is really a value and not just a sham-value and a trick.
We already notice that ‘multiculturalism’ is not working. We would further say that ‘it cannot work’. It has not worked historically and has led to civil strife and civil war. It is a bad idea therefore. It must be stopped before the damage goes much farther.
How? That is of course ‘the problem’. But the ‘problem’ should not have been created in the first place. (And here I specifically refer to the change on US immigration policy in 1965; to the British policies that will lead to the police state now developing there; and definitely to Sweden which is said now to be ‘lost’)."
Are Men Really Supposed To Accept Misandry And Anti-Male Bigotry? I Strongly Suggest That They Don’t…,ethicsalarms.com,Jack Marshall,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://ethicsalarms.com/2019/04/07/are-men-really-supposed-to-accept-misandry-and-anti-male-bigotry-i-strongly-suggest-that-they-dont/,"Search Search for: Are Men Really Supposed To Accept Misandry And Anti-Male Bigotry? I Strongly Suggest That They Don’t… / Jack Marshall
…unless they want to allow women to make them second-class citizens as pay-back for all those years of male domination.
Just as anti-white racism is considered justifiable and benign by a large lump of progressives, misandry and flagrant anti-male rhetoric has been similarly given a stamp of approval by much of the Left and the mainstream news media. I’ve been pointing out this unethical double standard and hypocrisy for a long time, notably in 2011, when ABC News hosted an all-female roundtable to discuss how inferior men were as managers and leaders, and how much better women are.*
It has only become worse and more blatant since then. The Washington Post published this op-ed by Suzanna Danuta Walters, Professor of Sociology and director of the Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program at Northeastern University.. A sample:
So men, if you really are #WithUs and would like us to not hate you for all the millennia of woe you have produced and benefited from, start with this: Lean out so we can actually just stand up without being beaten down. Pledge to vote for feminist women only. Don’t run for office. Don’t be in charge of anything. Step away from the power. We got this. And please know that your crocodile tears won’t be wiped away by us anymore. We have every right to hate you. You have done us wrong. #BecausePatriarchy. It is long past time to play hard for Team Feminism. And win.
Meanwhile, the New York Times didn’t feel that misandry AND racism should disqualify their choice for a place among their editors, Sarah, from whom a typical tweet is “white men are bullshit.” Now one of the three, generally awful in various ways, women who are certain to be the Democratic Presidential nominee in 2020, Kristin Gillibrand, tweeted out last year, “Our future is: Female. Intersectional. Powered by our belief in one another. And we’re just getting started.”
Imagine any other group in place of “Female,” and what would be the fate of the author. Yet it is just a few ticks from the primary message of the last women to run for President, who repeatedly argued that her gender alone should be enough to make voting for her the right thing to do.
The latest installment of the increasingly open anti-male bigotry from progressives, Democrats and the news media arrived last week in a jaw-dropping piece of misandry from Tina Brown, the British tabloid mistress who is only regarded as less odious than Rupert Murdock because of her lack of male genitalia, and the fact that she’s a feminist, of course. I know I do a lot of fisking on Ethics Alarms, but sometimes, as with Brown’s steaming plop of rhetorical offal, merely pointing out is general that it stinks lets the sample off too easy. This thing, called “ What Happens When Women Stop Leading Like Men,” demands vivisection. Read the whole ridiculous, insulting thing if you must, but here is what you are in for.
It begins with sufficient signature significance to make anyone expecting a fair or rational essay to give up on the spot:
“It has been another bad inning for male leadership. Besides the hourly flatulence of Trumpian twitterings and the addition of Brazil’s Bolsonaro to the confederacy of bullyboy power, we have been treated to a second wave of masculine mayhem. The reputations of the Patriots owner Robert Kraft, R. Kelly, the philanthropist Michael Steinhardt and even the sainted co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, Morris Dees, are the latest to circle the drain.”
This kind of dishonest cherry-picking is res ipsa loquitur for a bigot. Imagine listing recent black miscreants in the news and writing, “It has been another bad inning for American blacks.” In fact, this same “inning” hasn’t been so great for women, either.
Theresa May is flopping left and right as she tries to manage Brexit. Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, responded to a single terrorist attack by constraining the rights of law-abiding New Zealanders and censoring information. The biggest corporate scam artist in the U.S. is a woman, Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes , as a brand new HBO documentary reveals. The most infamous athletic coach of the moment is also a woman , Sylvia Hatchell, the University of North Carolina’s Hall of Fame women’s basketball coach. One of most revered figures in the sport, Haskell is under investigation after suggesting that her mostly black players would get “hanged from trees with nooses” at an upcoming game if their performance didn’t improve, and forcing players to play despite serious injuries. Another female basketball coach, Muffet McGraw of Notre Dame—coaches are leaders, right?— has announced that she refuses to hire men for her staff. That’s still gender discrimination, at least unti the Clinton-Brown Gillibrand law gets an OK from an all-female Supreme Court.
Just this week a female social justice warrior, doubtlessly inspired by female House member Maxine Waters’ exhortation that Trump supporters should be accosted and harassed in public, abused a Starbuck’s customer—male, of course—for wearing a red hat with a patriotic message. Meanwhile, two of the young, exciting women elected to the House are working hard to Make Anti-Semitism Great Again, while the old, annoying female House Speaker lets them get away with it.
And then there was that famed female editor who wrote an op-ed extolling anti-male bigotry while throwing ad hominem insults at the President. No, it has been a rough “inning” for women too.
But Tina is too busy obfuscating and spinning to mention that. In her next paragraph she extols Ardern for taking action that would be unconstitutional here. Would I be sexist if I explained Brown’s affection for gun-grabbing as the widespread female malady of finding guns “icky”? Probably.
Then we get the recitation of cases where women being put into leadership positions is automatically a wonderful thing. No, Tina, it’s a wonderful thing i f they are any good at it . To Tina, though, HIllary’s Delusion rules. The fact that a woman is a women is not only sufficient for her to be believed when she accuses a man of anything, it is enough to make her trustworthy:
“Countries from Georgia to Ethiopia have recently elected their first female presidents. Women now lead industries where once the thin air was inhaled only by men. For the first time, women have the top jobs at the New York Stock Exchange and at Nasdaq. With the ascension of Kathy Warden to C.E.O. of Northrop Grumman in January, four out of five of America’s biggest defense companies are run by women. Chicago is about to get its first black female mayor…”
Yes, about those female mayors, Tina. It was just a year ago that Female So She Must Be Good Nashville mayor Megan Barry resigned in the throes of a sex scandal that she never honestly acknowledged. Or was that a different “inning”? Then…
Democratic leading light Stacey Abrams just drew a line in the sand when she squelched the idea of running for vice president with the crisp rejoinder, “You don’t run for second place.”
You mean the same Stacy Abrams who has emulated Hillary Clinton by refusing to acknowledge her defeat in an election, and who is trying to exacerbate racial division and public distrust of our institutions by claiming, without evidence, that the Georgia gubernatorial election was rigged? You know, when I was a kid, guys claimed that women shouldn’t play sports because the girls were poor sports and cried when they lost. My personal experience taught me that the stereotype was baloney, but now Tina tells me that women who exemplify and reinforce that stereotype are good leaders.
Well, I’m just a stupid man; I can’t be expected to understand.
Among the 42 new women sworn into Congress, young rock stars like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez electrify all of us with their passion and verve…
Passion, verve, ignorance, arrogance, incompetence…
I guess if the idea is to call all female leaders excellent regardless of what they say and do, then Brown is right, all female leaders are excellent!
“I don’t contend that women are naturally and invariably better at running governments than men.”
This is exactly what this essay does, and she does it just a couple of sentences later with this howler:
“[W]e can at least argue that women are afflicted by what Hillary Clinton, who has spent a lifetime with someone who lacks it, once called “the responsibility gene.” I can bet a bucket of Bitcoins that we’ll never learn that any of the four married women plausibly seeking the Democratic presidential nomination are secretly sexting pictures of parts of their anatomy to a boyfriend.
Has your head exploded yet? Hillary Clinton has “the responsibility” gene? Funny, she refused to take responsibility for illegally using a home-server to send and receive classified e-mails. She refuses to take responsibility for losing the 2016 election, as if there was some other inept, distant, coughing, lying, spinning hypocrite running wearing a Hillary mask, and making embarrassing ads asking plaintively, “Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?” When she was being questioned about the slaughter at the Libyan outpost, she simultaneously said that she accepted responsibility and blamed the fiasco on her staff.
That’s some gene. “But there is a deep lesson here. During thousands of years of civilization, women have evolved to deal with the intractable perplexities of life and find means of peaceful coexistence where men have traditionally found roads to conflict. Women have accumulated rich ways of knowing that until recently were dismissed in male circles of power. The alchemy of what has made women the way they are is mysterious: Is it a result of centuries spent trying to survive and prosper in societies where they’ve been viewed as lesser? Or, until recently, of always being appointed the family caregiver, bearing and raising children, tending to elderly parents and disabled siblings, so often left to shoulder the unpaid burdens of real life? Women have learned and taught lessons about how to cope with seeming impossibilities in ways that men traditionally — and to this day — have not. Coaching a slow learner on homework after a day of hassles at the office provides a deep experience of delayed gratification. A woman’s wisdom comes, in part, from the great juggle of her life.”
In other words, Brown is arguing that women ARE superior, and using junk science and generalities to do it.
“Who will forget the image of the stoically seated CBS anchor Gayle King intoning in a soothing tone “Robert, Robert” to a flailing, weeping, lying R. Kelly?”
I won’t. I will remember it as an example of a confrontation-averse woman who was too intimidated to do her job , which involved telling an out-of-control guest to sit down, calm down, or leave.
Tina concludes,
Salvation doesn’t lie in pursuing traditional male paths of ejaculatory self-elevation. In drawing on women’s wisdom without apology and pushing that wisdom forward into positions of power, we can soothe our world and, maybe, even save it.
Nice bigoted rhetoric there, Tina: “ejaculatory self-elevation.” Your essay rebuts your point: successful women abuse power pretty much the same way men do, and have. There’s no evidence that they are any better at leadership and management than men, just evidence, like this Times piece, that they have convinced themselves that the remedy for past discrimination is for women to be bigots themselves.
If men let them get a way with it, they really are inferior."
Pete Buttigieg shreds evangelicals for supporting a man as immoral as Donald Trump,theunitedstatesblues.com,Will Bishop,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://theunitedstatesblues.com/pete-buttigieg-shreds-evangelicals-for-supporting-a-man-as-immoral-as-donald-trump/,"Pete Buttigieg shreds evangelicals for supporting a man as immoral as Donald Trump By - April 7, 2019
2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said Sunday on “Meet the Press” that evangelical Christians should be ashamed of their blatant hypocrisy for supporting a man as immoral as President Donald Trump.
Buttigieg was asked by host Chuck Todd to square Trump’s support among evangelicals with the president’s actions, and he admitted it’s “frustrating” since Trump seems preoccupied with “chest-thumping look at me-ism” instead of the Biblical tenets of humility and service to others, adding: Claim Your Free Gift! Free Dump Trump Toilet Paper As a Thank You to our readers we're giving away a Free Gift this Holiday season! Claim Free Gift Gift in partnership with blueisbest.net
“The hypocrisy is unbelievable. You have someone who..acts in a way that is not consistent with anything I hear in scripture or in church.
“You see the diametric opposite of [biblical teachings] in this presidency.”
Buttigieg, who is currently the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was also asked by Todd about his own lack of experience as an elected official in Washington. To that, Buttigieg responded:
“I would stack up my experience against anybody. I know it’s not as traditional, I haven’t been marinating in Washington here for a very long time and I’m not part of that same establishment but I would argue that being a mayor of a city of any size means that you have to deal with the kinds of issues that hit really hit Americans.”
Additionally, Buttigieg noted , he thinks he’s the perfect antidote to the rhetoric that comes from the White House, which he said suffers from a “loss of vision” and “loss of decency.”:
“It just might make sense for somebody my age, coming from experience in the industrial midwest, nonfederal, different background, bringing something that will actually help Americans envision the world as it will be in 2054, the year that I will be the current age of the current president. And just change the channel from this mesmerizing horror show that’s going on in Washington right now.”
Buttigieg is raising millions of dollars and making a name for himself on the national stage. Though he hasn’t formally announced his candidacy, it seems safe to bet that the South Bend mayor will be a major player in the 2020 race .
