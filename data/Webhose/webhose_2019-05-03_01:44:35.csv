Don’t Goad Trump Into Starting a War,www.theamericanconservative.com,Daniel Larison,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/dont-goad-trump-into-starting-a-war/,"Russian President Vladimir Putin By Harold Escalona/shutterstock And President Trump By Drop of Light/Shutterstock
Fareed Zakaria puts some of the worst habits of foreign policy punditry on display in these comments on Trump and Venezuela. It comes from a video, so I’m transcribing the full text here:
President Trump faces a crucial test of his foreign policy and his resolve over Venezuela. His administration has made absolutely clear that the U.S. no longer considers Nicolas Maduro to be president, a far stronger declaration than the “red line” that Barack Obama drew around Syria’s Assad. So far, Trump’s pressure has not worked. Maduro has dug in and the Venezuelan military has not abandoned its support for him. Now Venezuela is a complicated, divided country, and Maduro, as the heir to Hugo Chavez, does have some support in poor and rural areas. But far more significant in bolstering the regime in Caracas has been Russia’s open and substantial support.
Moscow now admits that it has sent military personnel to Venezuela. Two Russian military planes arrived in the country last weekend carrying about 100 troops. This is just the latest in a series of moves by Moscow to shore up Maduro. Over the last few years, Russia has provided wheat, arms, credit, and cash to the flailing Caracas government. Estimates of Russia’s total investment in Venezuela vary from 20-25 billion dollars. The Venezuelan gambit appears to be personally significant for Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. In recent years, as the Venezuelan economy has tanked and political instability has grown, even most Russian companies have abandoned the country, viewing it as too risky. But as Vladimir Rouvinski writes in a Wilson Center Report , Russian state-controlled oil giant Rosneft, which has close ties to Putin, has persisted and even ramped up its support for Maduro.
In other words, Putin is all in with his support for Maduro. He is doing this in part to prop up an old ally and because it adds to Russia’s clout in global oil markets, but above all because it furthers Putin’s central foreign policy objective: the formation of a global anti-American coalition of countries that can frustrate Washington’s purposes and usher in a more multipolar world. Putin’s efforts seem designed to taunt the United States, which announced the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, warning foreign powers to stay out of the Western Hemisphere. The big question for Washington is: will it allow Moscow to make a mockery of another American “red line”? The U.S. and Russia have taken opposing, incompatible stands on this issue, and as with Syria there is a danger that, if Washington does not back its words with deeds, a year from now we will be watching the consolidation of the Maduro regime supported by Russian arms and money. The administration has been tough on Russian involvement in Venezuela. Trump himself has even declared that “Russia has to get out,” but that is an unusual sentiment from Trump, who has almost never criticized Vladimir Putin and often sided with Russia on matters big and small. As former ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul has written, Trump has a remarkably consistent pattern of supporting Putin’s foreign policy goals. Trump has threatened to withdraw from NATO and has announced the removal of American troops from Syria. He has publicly disagreed with his own intelligence community’s conclusion that Moscow meddled with the 2016 election. Now I have never alleged collusion or conspiracy between Russia and Trump, writing merely that we should wait to see what evidence Robert Mueller presented. But the real puzzle remains: why has Trump been unwilling to confront Putin in any way on any issue? And will Venezuela finally be the moment when Trump ends his appeasement?
There are many things profoundly wrong with Zakaria’s statement, and the worst of them is the absurd and unfounded reference to “appeasement” at the end. Appeasement is a term used to insult and vilify in our foreign policy debates, and it is never used to describe anything accurately. To use it in this context is even more ridiculous than usual, because there is nothing that Trump has done as a matter of policy that could possibly be misconstrued as “appeasement.” It is an insult that hawks typically use when they want to agitate for a new war or when they desire to sabotage a negotiation. Since there is negotiation to be sabotaged in this case, we have to assume that Zakaria is trying to get Trump to start a war to prove his “resolve.”
It is simply false to say that Trump has never confronted or opposed Putin on any issue. He authorized sending arms to the Ukrainian government, withdrew the U.S. from the INF Treaty, expressed opposition to New START, presided over the ongoing expansion of NATO, ordered military attacks on the Syrian government twice, and backed an expansion of U.S. missile defense. All of these things are offensive to Russia to one degree or another. Zakaria’s examples are extremely weak, and he doesn’t have very many of them. Trump’s threats of withdrawing from NATO have been meaningless The “removal” of U.S. forces from Syria hasn’t happened, and there will be a residual U.S. military presence in Syria for the foreseeable future. The picture that Zakaria wants to paint of Trump as an “appeaser” is completely at odds with the substance of the unnecessarily hawkish actions that Trump has actually taken.
Zakaria is irresponsibly goading Trump to act recklessly in Venezuela to back up the president’s irresponsible rhetoric , and he is exploiting the anti-Russia hysteria of the last few years to do it. He exaggerates the significance of what Russia is doing and conjures up the specter of a “global anti-American coalition” that doesn’t exist. He grossly misrepresents what the Monroe Doctrine was in order to make it seem as if Russian-Venezuelan military cooperation represents an intolerable violation that must be answered. The Monroe Doctrine was not a warning to other powers to “stay out” of the hemisphere, but was limited only to telling European powers not to threaten the independence of Latin American republics. Russia clearly isn’t threatening Venezuela’s independence or its form of government, and that is what annoys Zakaria. He wrongly presents Venezuela as a showdown with Russia when the real issue is the political crisis among Venezuelans. Notice how there is no mention of the Venezuelan opposition or Juan Guaido anywhere in Zakaria’s remarks. He wants to cast this as another conflict between major powers, and it seems that he thinks that the U.S. needs to make up for whatever he thinks our government should have done in Syria by picking a fight with Russia in another place now. When he claims that Russia is “taunting” the U.S., Zakaria is clearly taunting Trump to do something foolish in order to uphold another stupid “red line.” It is nothing more than mindless do-somethingism with all of the terrible arguments about “credibility” and resolve that we have come to expect from interventionists.

"Dostoevsky and Lutheranism, the Real Socrates, and Making Sense of Caesar",www.theamericanconservative.com,Micah Mattix,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/prufrock/dostoevsky-and-lutheranism-the-real-socrates-and-making-sense-of-caesar/,"Tweet François-André Vincent, Alcibades Being Taught by Socrates (1776), via Wikimedia Commons
The poet Robinson Jeffers opposed America’s entry into the Second World War after Pearl Harbor. It made him persona non grata in American letters : “When ‘Pearl Harbor’ and other poems were collected in The Double Axe (1948), the appalled publisher added an extremely unusual disclaimer: ‘Random House feels compelled to go on record with its disagreement over some of the political views pronounced by the poet in this volume.’ If the author had been anyone less prestigious than Jeffers, now a Grand Old Poet, they would have much preferred to refuse publication. The affair shows how far the U.S. political spectrum had shifted since December 1941.”
Fyodor Dostoevsky didn’t care much for Lutheranism, but one of his favorite books growing up was a retelling of popular Bible stories by a Lutheran schoolmaster .
J. R. R. Tolkien’s son Christopher has not only faithfully cared for his father’s literary legacy, he has increased it : “Tolkien’s inability to finish the stories of the Elder Days, The Silmarillion , along with his exhaustion after 11 years of writing The Lord of the Rings , frustrated his own desires. Additionally, the British government continued to impose its own wartime restrictions on paper, even into the 1950s. Tolkien’s publisher had originally wanted and expected a sequel to The Hobbit , not an epic covering thousands and thousands of years, written with the depth and feeling of The Aeneid . Even after the successful publication and critical reception of The Lord of the Rings and his own retirement from teaching, Tolkien found it painful to finish The Silmarillion and his own mythology. He often spent his time instead on questions best left to his publisher and writing gorgeous essays on the philosophical and theological implications of his created world. It would take Tolkien’s son, Christopher, four years after his father’s death to compile and publish The Silmarillion . Even then, in 1977, it remained more a beautiful outline than a true representation of the early mythology. From there, though, Christopher’s output was nothing short of stunning.”
“Plato’s Socrates is an eccentric.” Was the real Socrates more worldly, Armand D’Angour asks in Aeon ?
A history of The Club : “If you had been in the vicinity of the Turk’s Head Tavern on Soho’s Gerrard Street on a Friday evening in the second half of the 18th century, you might have recognised a number of famous men disappearing up the stairs to a private room. The Club, as Leo Damrosch explains in this group biography of its members, was a dining, drinking and debating society for some of the leading lights of the age, established by Samuel Johnson and the portraitist Joshua Reynolds in 1764 to lift Johnson’s spirits as he struggled to complete his edition of Shakespeare’s plays. At its high point in the 1770s it brought together Johnson and Reynolds, James Boswell, Edmund Burke, Edward Gibbon, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Oliver Goldsmith and David Garrick.”
The bohemian posters (and life) of Toulouse-Lautrec : “The half-pint hedonist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was born in 1864…He emerged from this shallow gene pool with a cartoonish physiognomy, and an unknown genetic disorder that caused his legs to break in his early teens. They did not heal properly. In a plot whose tidy sentimentality could have been devised by Barnum or Dickens, Toulouse-Lautrec’s exclusion from ordinary physical activity sharpened his eye. The lightness and mobility denied to Toulouse-Lautrec by his faulty legs emerged from his hand.”
Essay of the Day:
Who was Julius Caesar? Among other things, Joseph Epstein argues in First Things , he was “the wrong man at the wrong time” :
“Even before Caesar’s rise, evidence was beginning to accumulate that the Roman Empire was becoming too vast and unwieldy to continue in business under traditional republican political arrangements. One such arrangement was the republic’s seemingly admirable term limits of one year for each of its two consuls, with a ten-year stint required between holding a second consulship. At the end of their terms, the two consuls went off under the title proconsul to govern one of the ever-increasing number of Roman provinces, often enriching themselves there by plunder. Elections to the various magistracies, including that of consul, were becoming corrupted by bribery and unredeemable promises. The Roman citizen-soldier, the finest in the ancient world, perhaps the finest ever, was more and more being replaced in the Roman army by foreign auxiliaries and mercenaries fighting under the Roman eagle. Empires, as ­Montesquieu held, seem at their most stable when they are expanding; they apparently cannot bear too lengthy periods of peace. Peace, somehow, in Rome was an encouragement to civil war.
“Julius Caesar, a true freelance, was the wrong man at the wrong time—wrong, that is, if saving the republic was the name of one’s desire. No party or faction in Rome was strong enough to resist him. Alea iacta est , the die is cast, Caesar is supposed to have said when he crossed the Rubicon and brought his legions into Rome. Caesar was an inveterate gambler, tossing the dice on many occasions, a gambler upon whom fortune seemed never to frown. But he had more than fortune alone going for him. He had an indomitable army, the support of the sprawling Roman population, and an apparently unslakable appetite for power. After the crushing effect of lengthy civil war, one-man rule must have been viewed by most Romans as a relief. The only thing in question was whether he, Caesar, wished to rise to the abominable title of king—though many felt he was already that without the title.
“Given the roll of honors lavished on Julius Caesar after his victories in Gaul and his crushing defeat of the shaky partnership of Pompey, Cato, and Metellus Scipio, the title of king might have seemed a downgrade. These honors included a life-dictatorship; the title imperator before his name, pater patriae after it; a statue of him set among former kings; a ceremonial chariot to carry his statue in religious processions round the circus; a golden throne in the senate; divine status ( divus Iulius ), with all its accoutrements; and other honors that, as Suetonius writes, ‘as a mere mortal he should certainly have refused.’ Far from refusing these honors, Caesar not only accepted them all but sometimes in doing so showed his contempt for them.”"

These days, it seems that everyone but the Amish are living their lives online. That is, they go there to find not just news and entertainment, not just e-commerce, but also digital assistance (Siri and Alexa), physical assistance (Task Rabbit, Fiverr), and transportation (Uber and Lyft). Why, there’s even Meural , which brings fine art into the home—digitally, for a monthly fee. And in each instance, of course, the digital company knows exactly what you’ve bought, done, or otherwise been up to.
Indeed, even those who don’t use any of these services are still Netizens, through their credit cards, their smartphones, their web browsers, their cable TV subscriptions, and other digital devices, including security gadgets in their homes, GPS and black boxes in their cars, security cameras in public spaces, keystroke monitors in the workplace, and the greatest data grab of them all, the Internet of Things.
Come to think of it, even the Amish, seemingly pastoral in their analog autonomy, can’t truly stay off the grid. They’re being tracked any time they interact with the government, which in turn puts their data, such as it is, in the same bucket as everyone else’s. Advertisement
All this digital subsuming, of course, is legal. As for what’s illegal , just in 2018, the top 10 data breaches affected 2.5 billion people, or at least that many accounts.
Speaking of illegality so common as to barely be newsworthy, we might consider the little-noticed case of Harold Thomas Martin , the former National Security Agency employee who just pled guilty to stealing some 50 terabytes of data from the NSA over two decades. (A terabyte is 1,000 gigabytes, if that helps.)
Interestingly, Martin doesn’t seem to have done anything with the data. Unlike his former NSA colleague, Edward Snowden, Martin seems to have been content to simply hoard it, packrat-style. And so it’s also interesting that Martin—who obviously has had mental health issues—managed to get and keep multiple security clearances over the years, even as he was piling up a stash 300 times larger than Snowden’s. As one expert observed : “What has changed over the past several decades or so is that the scale of the breaches has increased tremendously. Instead of individual secrets being compromised, it often turns out that entire databases or libraries of information.”
Such is the power of digitalization, sweeping away all those analog islands of privacy, making it easy to move whole Alexandria Libraries with a click of the mouse. What Does Free Speech Really Mean on Social Media?
So we can ask: if even the NSA can’t adequately police its data, what are the chances that the average data company hiring temps and other nomads—here in the U.S. and in scores of countries around the world—is keeping its data in good order?
In fact, data are so sloshy that one is tempted to say that these days a data leak is comparable to seawater flowing from the North Atlantic to the South Atlantic. G iven the adjacency, what did you expect?
Of course, it can certainly be argued that most people don’t truly care about their privacy—or perhaps have simply given up. Moreover, it appears that many people, especially the young, see “sharing” as part of the digital deal.
For instance, there’s Venmo , the e-payment system that’s part of Paypal. According to a report in Gizmodo last year, its users didn’t seem to understand that they were “sharing” their transaction histories not just with their friends, but with the entire internet . Or maybe users did know and they were fine with such disclosure. Perhaps, in the spirit of Andy Warhol, they were happy to think their digital lives would be famous for 15 minutes. In any case, Venmo is still in business.
Yet at the same time, there’s been plenty of pushback from the political system. That is, for reasons best explained by political scientists—it often goes under the name of social choice theory —personal choices are not the same as political choices. So even those whose personal actions bespeak a laissez-faire attitude toward privacy might nonetheless be militant about it in the political sphere.
On that score, the hottest digital button these days is Facebook. Looking back on the company’s last decade of tumultuous growth, one might conclude that while it was okay for the 2008 Obama campaign to use Facebook to access everyone’s information , it was not okay for the 2016 Trump campaign to do so.
Yet for a while there, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg didn’t seem to understand that the ’16 election was being viewed differently from the ’08 election. Immediately after Trump’s victory, Zuck insisted that there was nothing to worry about . Yet within a year, he acknowledged the need to do something . Furthermore, in April 2018, he found himself testifying on Capitol Hill, touting his new commitment to good digital citizenship.
In fact, Facebook had by then launched a fascinating political science experiment of its own—a worldwide instant shadow government. That is, it hired lawyers to determine appropriate speech codes , and then it contracted with tens of thousands of low-paid content monitors to enforce those codes.
In other words, it was as if all the arguments about speech ever made anywhere—free speech, hate speech, speech that enlightens, speech that befogs—were summarized and then crammed into a thumb drive, so that mostly young people, consuming lots of energy drinks and pizza, could dope out appropriate rules for the planet’s digital discourse. (In a way, the nation-building hubris of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq 15 years ago—all that planning for a better world—was weirdly recaptured in conference rooms in Menlo Park, California. Happily for them, Facebookers were spared the bloody folly that ensued.)
Still, nobody was happy with Facebook’s effort, and so now, Zuckerberg—a man known for his imperial ambition —is backing away from the once-beaconing vision of globe-girdling enforcement. Instead, he’s now anchoring himself in more realistic political wisdom. In particular, he wants to hand off the problem to others, taking the onus off his social network. That revised goal was clear enough in a March 30 op-ed in The Washington Post , in which Zuckerberg called for help on a number of issues, including content monitoring:
One idea is for third-party bodies to set standards governing the distribution of harmful content and to measure companies against those standards. Regulation could set baselines for what’s prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum.
So let’s recap. Once upon a time—that is, just a little more than two years ago—Facebook said there was no problem. Then it said that there was a problem, and that it was being handled. Now Facebook is saying that it wants third parties to handle the problem. So here’s a cinchy prediction: those third parties will turn out to be governments, starting with the U.S. government—and that will be just dandy with Facebook.
The idea that companies actively want to be regulated is a familiar one. A half-century ago, economic historian Gabriel Kolko published a classic text , The Triumph of Conservatism: A Reinterpretation of American History, 1900-1916 , which argued that it was the political progressives of the era who inspired the creation of the Federal Trade Commission, which, in Kolko’s view, was a conservative—as in status quo-oriented—bureaucracy.
To be sure, the status quo is not so bad if you’re on top. Thus from the vantage point of the commanding heights, it’s tempting to have the government enforce common standards for an industry, thereby keeping “order” in the marketplace. Moreover, it’s not hard for said industry to help set the standards for itself. And yes, political scientists have a phrase for this, too: “regulatory capture.”
Indeed, this phenomenon is so predictable that it’s barely even regrettable. It’s just the way things work out, as abuses pile up and the political system decides that the industry in question needs to be protected and even nurtured. As this author wrote last year, “Someday Facebook could start to resemble the old broadcast networks, under the watchful eye of the Federal Communications Commission, or maybe even a bit like the old Ma Bell.”
It’s a safe bet that the same sort of regulatory drapery will soon adorn not just Facebook, but the entire digital sector. Although, of course, a few decades down the road, it’s likely that some new entrepreneurial or technological force will jolt the system, thus starting up the political cycle all over again.
In the meantime, there’s the issue of privacy. As we have seen, there isn’t much of it: that Rubicon was crossed decades ago when the world went digital and thus transparent to the techsters.
And now, to supervise, here comes Uncle Sam.

How the Pentagon Budget is a Threat to the Middle Class,www.theamericanconservative.com,Jonathan Askonas,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/how-the-pentagon-budget-is-a-threat-to-the-middle-class/,"Nicaragua: Washington’s Other Hemispheric Nemesis How the Pentagon Budget is a Threat to the Middle Class While military spending subsidizes a certain lifestyle for some, it also contributes to trends that put the rest of the country at risk. By sababa66/Shutterstock
According to SAIS Professor Hal Brands, progressives and Americans should embrace the social benefits military spending offers to the middle class. Not only does American military strength support the liberal world order that makes the world “safe for democracy,” Brands claimed, but military spending undergirds millions of middle-class jobs for service members, civilian employees, and contractors for the Pentagon.
In reality, the opposite is true: American military adventurism and massive spending undermines middle-class prosperity and makes the world less free and secure. A militarized approach to American foreign policy harms global freedom and security far more than it helps.
Though modern Washington seems to have forgotten it, the architects of the post-World War II American-led liberal world order understood that it would not—and could not— be secured by American military power alone. Strong diplomatic and trade relationships allow international institutions to flourish and help secure global buy-in from national governments.
In recent years, reckless interventions, underinvestment in relationships and diplomacy, and the hypertrophy of the U.S. military has undermined America’s ability to shore up this order. In a vicious cycle that former Defense and State Department advisor Rosa Brooks compared to a Walmart devouring the local general store, Washington’s growing reliance on the military’s vast capacity to fill in for civilian agencies leads to further atrophy of American diplomacy and adaptability in foreign affairs. As then-CENTCOM Commander General James Mattis once warned , “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.” Advertisement
The notion that military spending underwrites a middle-class lifestyle for millions is even more off base. It discounts the long-term effects of military spending on the American economy as a whole, as political economy experts increasingly see a dangerous relationship between free-wheeling military spending and boom-bust cycles.
Boston University political scientist Rosella Cappella Zielinski has shown , for example, how the desire to sustain high levels of military spending without sacrificing domestic political priorities led President Lyndon B. Johnson to rely on debt-financed military spending that eventually precipitated the demise of the gold standard, stagflation, and a recession.
Political economist Thomas Oatley has likewise argued that every postwar economic boom, save one, was caused directly or indirectly by military spending (including stagflation and the 2008 financial crisis). Ten years after 2008, the average middle-class family’s net wealth is still $40,000 lower than 2007 , and constraints on government spending throughout the West have contributed to public disillusionment and surging populism.
While military spending might subsidize a middle-class lifestyle for some, it has contributed to macroeconomic trends that are hollowing out the middle class writ large. Those Porky Pentagon Earmarks Never Really Went Away
Using the military as a replacement for the social safety net is a boondoggle, not a boon. Brands quotes a forthcoming Carnegie Endowment study to say, “a middle-class standard of living would be put out of reach for several thousand Ohioans if they could not count on the National Guard and Reserves as a way to contribute toward their educational expenses, acquire coveted training, earn a livable wage, provide healthcare, and add to their portfolio of retirement benefits.”
A more accurate way of putting this would be to say that for Americans not living in a few elite parts of the country, healthcare, education, and a livable wage are increasingly dependent on your willingness to serve as cannon-fodder for America’s ill-advised wars. As Eric Levitz commented at New York magazine , this reflects the failure of political elites more than a sly victory for progressive (or any other) politics.
The net result of conducting social programming by way of military spending is to ensure the burdens of America’s wars fall on an increasingly small part of the population already beset by serious economic woes. In regions of America suffering trade-related job losses and bipartisan abandonment, military enlistment rates are rising to compensate for the withering American Dream. Places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin are thus hit with a one-two punch of economic decline and military casualties.
In the Federalist Papers, even our most pro-federal spending founders held that a large standing army and a heavy, un-financed public debt burden were a danger to our republic’s health and security. Combining the two in the form of an ever-growing military budget is no victory. It is a threat to the future of the United States as we know it.

The danger of the military industrial complex to Uncle Sam was stated by Ike. Since then, nothing and no one has slowed down its growth. Not the Democrats, not the Republicans. Communism was the external threat that justified any amount of spending. With the fall of the U.S.S.R., remember the words,”peace dividend”? That lasted about 15 minutes. 9-11 baked blank check defense spending into the cake for the foreseeable future. Anyone of any political stripe, liberal or conservative, who calls for a reduction in spending is immediately labeled by their opponents as weakening the defenses of our great nation. It’s a lie, but it’s a lie that gets votes. More’s the pity. Whine Merchant April 3, 2019 at 7:21 am
There are no military parades in rust belt towns, just sad funerals. There are no shiny medals in meth land, just battered children and homeless families. The best way out of our ghettos is to volunteer to be canon fodder for neocon adventurism.
Just as any criticism of Netanyahu and west bank settlers is decried as ‘antisemitism’, any criticism of GOP wars is called ‘anti-soldier’ and unAmerican.
Will anyone at TAC please explain how we got to this? It is just Deplorable – Johann April 3, 2019 at 10:07 am
Thinking that military spending helps the economy is just military Keynesianism. Its stupid on its face. It takes resources out of the private economy that produces goods and services for all. Those resources include valuable productive people who are diverted from the private economy. Some of our best scientists and engineers spend their careers designing and manufacturing high tech planes, tanks, ships, and other equipment that we hope will never be used.
I get that if we don’t have a national defense that we may not even have a country, but our policy of foreign intervention is NOT national defense. Our defense budget could be a small fraction of the current budget if it were based on true national defense. Guest"

"Two Tolkiens, One Better World",www.theamericanconservative.com,Bradley J. Birzer,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/two-tolkiens-one-better-world/,"Two Tolkiens, One Better World In his last faithful rendering of his father's vision, Christopher weaves new myth into Middle-earth's rich tapestry.
The Fall of Gondolin, J.R.R. Tolkien, ed. Christopher Tolkien, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 304 pages
Though he very rarely talked about his service in the First World War—his silence most likely the result of survivor’s guilt, something he shared with most of his post-war friends—J.R.R. Tolkien said that his invented worlds really took form in “army huts, crowded, filled with the noise of gramophones.” The war, he realized in hindsight, had forced him to imagine a beauty and wonder beyond the brutal life of the trenches.
Because of Tolkien’s adamant rejection of formal allegory in his own writings, many of his greatest supporters denied for years that any passage (or passages) in The Lord of the Rings had anything to do with the war itself, at least directly. As early as the 1950s, however, Tolkien’s good friend, C.S. Lewis, was challenging this view, (he had also gone through the war, a volunteer despite being Irish). Advertisement
Though Lewis remembered the fonder parts of it in his autobiography, especially the friendships he formed, the first bullet that flew past his head roused him to think, “This is war. This is what Homer wrote about.” No doubt the two survivors had talked innumerable times—privately—about their own experiences in the war. In his praising review of Tolkien’s trilogy, Lewis wrote that the battle scenes have “the very quality of the war my generation knew. It is all here: the endless, unintelligible movement, the sinister quiet on the front when ‘everything is now ready,’ the lying civilians, the lively, vivid friendships, the background of something like despair and the merry foreground, and such heaven-sent windfalls as a cache of choice tobacco ‘salvaged’ from a ruin.”
Still, it must also be noted that Tolkien revealed in a speech at the University of St. Andrews in 1939 that the Great War had “awakened” his imagination. Certainly, in the trilogy itself, as he admitted toward the end of his life, the crossing of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum into the region of Mordor mirrored much of what he had seen in the Great War. “Dreadful as the Dead Marshes had been, and the arid moors of the Norman-lands, more loathsome far was the country that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes,” Tolkien writes. “Here nothing lived, not even the leprous growths that feed on rottenness. The gasping pools were choked with ash and crawling muds, sickly white and grey, as if the mountains had vomited the filth of their entrails upon the lands about.” Though the horrifying imagery continues in the story at some length, it is worth noting here that few passages in 20th-century literature so perfectly captured the feeling and atmosphere of the Great War.
Having already lost his mother and his father at a young age, Tolkien also lost two of his three closest friends during the war. Prior to that war, he and his three friends had dedicated themselves to sanctifying the world through poetry and literature. We had, Tolkien believed, “been granted some spark of fire—certainly as a body if not singly—that was destined to kindle a new light, or, what is the same thing, rekindle an old light in the world.” Given the depth of feeling Tolkien possessed toward his friends and the burdens of the Great War, there is no reason to underplay his words. By 1916, he had already begun his Elvish languages as well as his first stories for those languages, in addition to writing much poetic verse. “The greatness [of the four friends] I meant was that of a great instrument in God’s hands,” Tolkien wrote in 1916, as “a mover, a doer, even an achiever of great things, a beginner at the very least of large things.” ♦♦♦ Walker Percy's Funny and Frightening Prophecy
Of the original stories that Tolkien wrote for his nascent mythology, the first real attempt at depth as well as breadth was The Fall of Gondolin , most likely begun in 1916. From there, the story took on an unwieldy and unpredictable life of its own, like many of Tolkien’s writings. Tolkien’s wife, Edith, wrote out the story sometime in 1917 after he had first written it, and Tolkien offered a version of it as a public essay in 1920 at Exeter College, Oxford. The story appeared as one of the most drawn-out of Tolkien’s Lost Tales (the first version of the larger mythology that would one day become The Silmarillion ); in slightly different form in the 1926 “Sketch of the Mythology”; in yet again slightly different form in the 1930 Quenta Noldorinwa ; and, finally, in 1950 and 1951, as Tolkien was trying to write the history of the ages preceding the now completed but yet unpublished The Lord of the Rings . The final 1951 version ended up, more or less, in the 1977 Silmarillion .
While one should accept Tolkien’s claim that he disliked and did not intentionally employ formal allegory, it would be foolish to assume that the loss of family and friends, the Great War, and the advent of the modern world did not profoundly influence his writings. These events all shaped his mythology, which he used as a way, as he noted to his friends, to sanctify the world and to correct that which had gone wrong. The Fall of Gondolin , in particular, considers issues of prophecy and calling, friendship and betrayal, loss, acceptance, love, pride, and, most importantly, perseverance. In it, one finds passionate love stories, heroic battles to the death, prophets lost and distracted, organic machines of immense power, distraught gods full of charity, confusion of purpose, kings living as outlaws, and soul-piercing beauties.
A secret city of the Elves, Gondolin served as the only significant safe haven during the ravages and tyranny of the devil figure of the mythology, Morgoth (aka Melko, aka Melkor), the brightest of created powers who came to resent his maker, Iluvatar (God the Father). Alone in the East of the world—Beleriand and Middle-earth—the Elves continued the traditions of the holy powers in the West in Valinor, even in their exile. From the hidden realm, the Elves could live, but they could also use it as a base to reclaim the lands from evil and ruin:
In those days Ulmo was filled with pity for the exiled Elves in their need, and in the ruin that had now almost overwhelmed them. He foretold that the fortress of Gondolin should stand longest of all the refuges of the Elves against the might of Morgoth, and like Doriath never be overthrown save by treachery from within. Because of his protecting might the spells of concealment were strongest in those parts nearest to Sirion, though there the Encircling Mountains were at their lowest.
In that same version, Tolkien described Gondolin in idyllic terms:
Upon Amon Gwareth, the Hill of Defence, the rocky height amidst the plain, was built Gondolin the great, whose fame and glory is mightiest in song of all dwellings of the Elves in these Outer Lands. Of steel were its gates and of marble were its walls. The sides of the hill the Gnomes polished to the smoothness of dark glass, and its top they levelled for the building of their town, save amidmost where stood the tower and palace of the king. Many fountains there were in that city, and white waters fell shimmering down the glistening sides of Amon Gwareth. The plain all about they smoothed till it became as a lawn of shaven grass from the stairways before the gates unto the feet of the mountain wall, and nought might walk or creep across unseen.
For better or worse, the Elves chose the comfort of isolation rather than the mission of world redemption. Meanwhile, Morgoth’s reign grew, and, ultimately, he laid siege to the city. In one version of the story, the water god Ulmo offers aid to the Elves by giving them the city.
More moving, yet deeply disturbing, is Tolkien’s description of the perversions wrought by Morgoth:
Then on a time Melko assembled all his most cunning smiths and sorcerers, and of iron and flame they wrought a host of monsters such as have only at that time been seen and shall not again be till the Great End. Some were all of iron so cunningly linked that they might flow like slow rivers of metal or coil themselves around and above all obstacles before them, and these were filled in their innermost depths with the grimmest of the Orcs with scimitars and spears; others of bronze and copper were given hearts and spirits of blazing fire, and they blasted all that stood before them with the terror of their snorting or trampled whatso escaped the ardour of their breath; yet others were creatures of pure flame that writhed like ropes of molten metal, and they brought to ruin whatever fabric they came nigh, and iron and stone melted before them and became as water, and upon them rode the Balrogs in hundreds; and these were the most dire of all those monsters which Melko devised against Gondolin.
While one might readily find such a description of organic machinery later in the 20th century, to describe it as such in 1917 is somewhat bewilderingly advanced. Equally important, one can readily imagine Tolkien’s creations as something that might appear from the German advance, as tanks replaced cavalry. True to Tolkien’s romanticism, machinery almost always appears as tyrannical and anti-humane in his literature.
Additionally, following the Western tradition going back to St. Augustine and Boethius, Tolkien believes that evil exists not as a thing in and of itself, but as a rape, an imitation, and a desecration of an original good. Orcs, for example, are tortured and inverted Elves:
How it came ever that among men the Noldoli [one form of Elf] have been confused with the Orcs who are Melko’s goblins, I know not, unless it be that certain of the Noldoli were twisted to the evil of Melko and mingled among these Orcs, for all that race were bred by Melko of the subterranean heats and slime. Their hearts were of granite and their bodies deformed; foul their faces which smiled not, but their laugh that of the clash of metal, and to nothing were they more fain than to aid in the basest of the purposes of Melko. The greatest hatred was between them and the Noldoli, who named them Glamhoth , or folk of dreadful hate.
One might also think of the Hebraic tradition of God as the all being—I Am That I Am—with all else radiating from him in what later thinkers might call the “economy of grace” or “great chain of being.”
And yet, true to Tolkien, those most misunderstood, ignored, or mocked in the world often, at some unexpected point, find their true natures revealed to the world and, most importantly, to themselves. Tuor, the outlaw turned heroic king in The Fall of Gondolin , becomes fully himself at one moment as he looks toward the sacred West:
Then Tuor arrayed himself in the hauberk, and set the helm upon his head, and he girt himself with the sword; black were sheath and belt with clasps of silver. Thus armed he went forth from Turgon’s hall, and stood upon the high terraces of Taras in the red light of the sun. None were there to see him, as he gazed westward, gleaming in silver and gold, and he knew not that in that hour he appeared as one of the Mighty of the West, and fit to be the father of the kings of the Kings of Men beyond the Sea, as it was indeed his doom to be; but in the taking of those arms a change came upon Tuor son of Huor, and his heart grew great within him. And as he stepped down from the doors the swans did him reverence, and plucking each a great feather from their wings they proffered them to him, laying their long necks upon the stone before his feet; and he took the seven feathers and set them in the crest of his helm, and straightway the swans arose and flew north in the sunset, and Tuor saw them no more. ♦♦♦
When Tolkien published his massive three-volume trilogy, the masterful The Lord of the Rings , in 1954 and 1955, he was originally hoping to complete an even longer version, all in one volume. The hoped-for book would have been almost double the size of The Lord of the Rings and would include a fleshed-out version of The Silmarillion , to be called The Saga of the Jewels and the Rings . Those familiar with The Lord of the Rings know how often the stories of the Elder Days appear at critical moments in the trilogy. When the Ringwraiths are about to attack the hobbits and Aragorn on Weather Top, the ranger tells the ancient and timeless story of Beren and Lúthien, almost as a preparatory prayer in anticipation of battle. Galadriel, in a moment of confession, admits she has lived in Middle-earth since before the fall of Gondolin. When Sam and Frodo wonder what their fate is as they approach Mount Doom, they compare their own experiences with those of a previous age, recognizing that they exist in the same story, just at a later time.
Indeed, the very phial of Galadriel, which proves critical in the suffocating darkness of Shelob’s lair, contains the very light that had first existed close to the time of creation itself. Truly Frodo and Sam occupy the same story as Beren and Lúthien.
Yet Tolkien’s inability to finish the stories of the Elder Days, The Silmarillion , along with his exhaustion after 11 years of writing The Lord of the Rings , frustrated his own desires. Additionally, the British government continued to impose its own wartime restrictions on paper, even into the 1950s. Tolkien’s publisher had originally wanted and expected a sequel to The Hobbit , not an epic covering thousands and thousands of years, written with the depth and feeling of The Aeneid .
Even after the successful publication and critical reception of The Lord of the Rings and his own retirement from teaching, Tolkien found it painful to finish The Silmarillion and his own mythology. He often spent his time instead on questions best left to his publisher and writing gorgeous essays on the philosophical and theological implications of his created world.
It would take Tolkien’s son, Christopher, four years after his father’s death to compile and publish The Silmarillion . Even then, in 1977, it remained more a beautiful outline than a true representation of the early mythology. From there, though, Christopher’s output was nothing short of stunning. In 1980, he published Unfinished Tales and, between 1983 and 1996, the 12 volumes of The History of Middle-earth , a massive undertaking of love and piety. Silent for almost a decade, but infuriated by the travesty of the Peter Jackson movies, Christopher reappeared in the publishing world, hoping to reclaim his father’s ideas, words, characters, and stories for an audience desiring more than action sequences and computer generated eye candy. He hoped an audience for poetic wonder still existed, even in the 21st-century wasteland of modernity. Over the last 12 years, Christopher has come back with a vengeance, publishing his father’s scholarly work on his many varied mythologies as well as specific stories from The Silmarillion , but, most notably, the three that mattered most to his father: the tale of Beren and Lúthien , The Children of Húrin , and, as of last fall, The Fall of Gondolin .
As with the other books that Christopher has edited, this latest Tolkien release, The Fall of Gondolin , follows the chronological evolution of J.R.R. Tolkien’s various tales. As always, Christopher offers not just the chronology but an insightful examination of why his father chose this or that, as opposed to that or this. Presumably, The Fall of Gondolin is the son’s last, though not all of the father’s writings have yet seen print.
Now aged 94, Christopher must be praised mightily and in every way for his service not only to his father, but, frankly, also to Western civilization. After all, it would not be too much of a stretch to compare his father’s mythology to that of Homer, Virgil, and Dante. And, it bears repeating: though J.R.R. Tolkien despised formal allegory, his created mythology, begun sometime around 1913 and still not completely finished—despite the work of father and son—reflects all of our anxieties and desires in the modern and postmodern worlds. If we speak exclusively of J.R.R. Tolkien in relation to the mythology of Middle-earth, we have created a grave error. Truly, we must properly speak of the Two Tolkiens: J.R.R. and Christopher.

What Happened to Trump’s Promise to Rebuild America?,www.theamericanconservative.com,Daniel McGraw,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/what-happened-to-trumps-promise-to-rebuild-america-midwest-flooding/,"Nicaragua: Washington’s Other Hemispheric Nemesis What Happened to Trump’s Promise to Rebuild America? He said he would fix our highways, bridges, and tunnels, and put millions to work. But politics got in the way. Tweet Spencer, NE-March 14, 2019: Spencer Dam damage after ice jam breaks through the dam By Robert 2001/Shutterstock
Those who live and watch the weather in the Great Plains know that the storms there are not singular in their effects. A lot of factors come into play.
How much moisture is locked in the soil, what the previous months had wrought weather-wise, how much runoff the rivers had been handling, and even how the volatile currents in the atmosphere mix as spring jostles with winter—all these things affect whether you can take the kids to the park or plant the corn this week or next or go fishing on the river today or tomorrow.
In mid-March, all of those factors came into play, and what looked like a land-based hurricane hitting Nebraska and its neighboring states on the weather radar was just that: a horrific and record-breaking storm that even many old-timers had never seen the likes of before. Meteorologists call such storms “bomb cyclones” and this was one of the biggest ever. The flooding in Nebraska was the worst in 50 years.
“This was a monster, no question about it,” said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Weather Prediction Center. Advertisement
And what that “monster” has left behind is opening up the never-ending national debate on how to take care of our infrastructure, which was left severely damaged in this storm’s wake. Everyone agrees that the United States has fallen behind on keeping up its roads and bridges and flood levees—even its airports and schools and sewer systems. And everyone knows the cost of fixing those problems will be huge.
In its 2017 report card on the condition of our nation’s infrastructure, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) awarded a D+ or “poor” rating . The study estimated the cost of bringing America’s infrastructure to a state of good repair (a grade of B) by 2025 at $4.6 trillion, of which only about 55 percent has been committed. Improving roads and bridges alone will require $1.1 trillion more than states, localities, and the federal government have allocated.
“It’s hurting our economy, it’s hurting our communities’ ability to grow, it’s hurting our quality of life, and in some cases, there are public safety concerns,” Kristina Swallow, then the president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, said in an interview last year. “Our infrastructure is not meeting our needs.”
That infrastructure cost—and the question of who will pay for it—has been one of the focal points of the discussion over the bomb cyclone hitting Nebraska. The cost of the damage has surpassed $1.3 billion, state officials say, according to the Associated Press. That includes $449 million in damage to roads, levees, and other infrastructure, $440 million in crop losses, and $400 million in cattle losses. The Politics of Infrastructure
The federal government is offering emergency funding for basic cleanups, but the states and cities and counties have been left to their own devices to rebuild washed away bridges.
Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts said in interviews in late March, “I don’t think there’s ever been a disaster this widespread in Nebraska. …Obviously we’ve got a lot of recovery left ahead of us. It’s going to be a long road for us to rebuild our infrastructure and get people back in their homes.”
About 290 miles of roads have been closed, and 200 of the miles that need major repair are part of the state highway system.
“We will work as quickly as possible,” Ricketts said. “But when it comes to the major projects like our public infrastructure, roads, bridges, we’re going to need the public’s patience because it is going to take a while to get all of this recovered.”
The reason that this Great Plains emergency is bringing this issue to the forefront is its timing. The polarization of politics has frozen in its tracks what used to be a fairly simple process of infrastructure investment. For decades now, Congress and the White House have had a difficult time passing out what used to be favors to each other.
Infrastructure projects used to be a main currency of the legislative process. Call them pork barrel or earmarks projects, but Congress routinely crossed the aisle to pass this funding. Some might have been of the “bridge to nowhere” variety, but most fulfilled actual needs. It was a practical way to fix things, and a good way to get re-elected.
There were thoughts that the election of Donald Trump might move things along infrastructure-wise. Trump, after all, had been a real estate developer, knew how the construction process worked, dealt with state and local governments, and said that fixing American infrastructure was a big goal of his administration.
In 2015, even before he even announced he was running, Trump tweeted, “The only one to fix the infrastructure of our country is me.” On the campaign trail, Trump said he would “at least double” Hillary Clinton’s $275 billion in infrastructure spending. In his victory speech, Trump said, “We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. And we will put millions of our people to work.”
He promised to make infrastructure a priority in his two State of the Union speeches. In early 2018, he sent Congress an infrastructure plan that included $200 billion in federal funds to stimulate more than $1.5 trillion in spending from local and state governments and private entities over a decade.
Yet whether because of his obsession with the Mueller investigation, the failure to replace Obamacare, or the wall-building imbroglio, neither Trump nor Congress has yet rolled up its sleeves to work on infrastructure spending. Trump’s 2020 budget request to Congress does call for a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, but it’s been scaled back from previous initiatives. In fact, it’s barely mentioned in the current budget request.
Why has infrastructure spending moved to the back of the line? First and foremost, the House chamber is now controlled by Democrats who will be reticent to help Trump achieve any success. Also, some Democrats prefer to make statements, forcing the Green New Deal or immigration rules or affordable housing regs into any infrastructure bill. Or Trump may have simply lost interest, deciding it isn’t worth trying with the 2020 election less than two years out.
The president and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have indicated they are still talking about some infrastructure deal, but most see it as unlikely to happen, especially if Trump uses the Mueller investigation against the Democrats, and it already appears he is going down that road.
“Is it time for infrastructure? Democrats and the administration are very far apart,” James Pethokoukis, an economic analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said on CNBC in late March. “I highly doubt we are going to see anything like that. Maybe if this was like the beginning of last year, now that we are deep into the election season, I don’t think so.”
On the other hand, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana—one of the Democrats running for president—understands that citizens are more concerned over their toilets flushing efficiently than a United Nations climate change resolution.
“Like public surface in general, sewers are unbelievably important,” he said in a public radio interview in February . “They’re so important that we make sure they work basically all of the time. Which is why you never think of them—that’s kind of the point. But it’s not that different from national security. It’s like I say, people experience the more freedom the less they think about it.”
“By the way, most infrastructure is underground,” he continued. “I know we think about bullet trains and airports. That’s cool, too, but if you really want to talk about a major American infrastructure program, come see what the combined sewer overflow cities are dealing with.”
In Nebraska, water flow is what they are dealing with, above ground and below and from the faucets. Hundreds of people in Nebraska’s Boyd County (nearer to South Dakota than Omaha) won’t have water for four to eight more weeks because an 11-foot wave of ice and water took out the 90-year-old Spencer Dam two weeks ago.
Then there are the road problems, such as the one the Omaha World-Herald described: “West Dodge Road west of 204th Street looks like a pancake poured too thin, warped and uneven, with pieces peeling off.”
Colten Schafersman, who raises corn and chickens near Hooper, about 45 miles northeast of Omaha on the Elkhorn River, sees the infrastructure issue as very much about basic economics.
If the bridge over the Elkhorn River goes out, which it is about to now, Schafersman will have a hard time trucking his chickens and corn to market and silos. People living in a city wouldn’t put up with what he’s being forced to, he said in a TV interview.
“Where we go from our farm most of the time is about a mile across the river,” he says. “That’s for the people that work here too. But for us to get our goods to market, or for the people to get here for work, they’d have to drive 50 miles to go one mile. That’s what this is all about.”

Academia: No Place For Young Scholars?,www.theamericanconservative.com,Rod Dreher,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/academia-no-place-for-young-scholars/,"Where indeed? In particular, I’d like to ask you readers who are academics to comment on this man’s take. Would you advise promising young scholars to go into academia? Why or why not?
Dear Lord No!
The job has been made horrible over the last few decades. What is worse is that the incentives have been rearranged to make the worst kind of people the most likely to succeed in many cases. Nevertheless, it is a vaguely religious calling. Just because the job prospects are horrible, you will almost certainly fail, and the job is much less enjoyable than it was decades ago doesn’t make the advancement of knowledge or the preservation of truth and beauty any less noble. It is past time to start thinking about institutional reform and new types of institutions though. XianLSE April 2, 2019 at 11:34 pm
I agree that pursuing a career in academia is a roll of the dice because of the job market. Most intelligent young people are better off doing something else.
I do want to encourage Jr. prof, and just say that being at a “ho hum” university has many advantages that hopefully he or she can benefit from. My wife and I teach at just such a college (she’s tenure track, I’m adjunct) and we’ve found that teaching students from a more blue-collar background than you would ever find at an elite university can be a real joy. For one thing, the students are much more practical, which means that they are much less likely to be infested with all the postmodern baggage that elite students bring with them (note Jonathan Haidt’s point that the disease in higher ed begins long before college). We have found great opportunities to build relationships with students who truly value the opportunity to be in college and who, while they are typically good liberals, really just want to find their way in the world and look up to their professors for guidance. I could go on, but really I just want to encourage you to not disdain your place but find the ways that it can bring satisfaction. Be grateful you aren’t at Yale, where all the crap that Dreher regularly highlights is unavoidable. John_M April 2, 2019 at 11:44 pm
I chose not to go the academic route after getting my Ph.D – although I almost went back as director of a computer security/assurance program – but that is a high level job training program feeding the government and sensitive industries, even though you do do do a bit of research. My nephew in molecular genetics found that the job situation is totally insane – hundreds of people applying for each faculty position, so he now is a research scientist at Oak Ridge Labs. The problem is that even in engineering and the hard sciences, the number of Ph.D’s being graduated far exceeds the number of available faculty and primary industrial research positions – so everybody has to scramble. Under such conditions and limited research grants, academia doesn’t look all that desirable – you may spend a few years in it, but you need to plan for a life beyond it.
I started as a Physicist 50 years ago and realized that it would be necessary to avoid the ‘big machine’ areas as the job situation would become untenable. It did. Jonah R. April 2, 2019 at 11:46 pm
I worked for a university for several years. No, aspiring scholar, do not aim for a job in academia, no mater your politics or religious beliefs. The supply of sufficiently credentialed scholars is so much larger than the tiny number of jobs that you could be Professor Wokey Wokerson with two PhDs and a file of blackmail photos on everyone on every hiring committee in your field, and even then you’ll be lucky to land an adjunct position where you make less per hour than if you stocked shelves at the Piggly Wiggly.
Anyone who doubts this should go read all of the blogs, Twitter feeds, and op-eds by struggling graduate students and adjuncts, many of whom struggle with depression, substance abuse, anxiety, and, in my opinion, some variation on Stockholm Syndrome. Look at the job listings in your field and compare them to the number of newly minted PhDs. Do the most rudimentary research on your career prospects and the only argument in favor of going for it will be the most foolish brand of magical thinking.
Yes, there are efforts afoot to unionize, but that won’t make more jobs available. It will just help the most politically active candidates get the few jobs that do exist.
And look at tuition costs: college is a bubble that will burst. Parents aren’t going to put up with these prices for much longer. Kids are already opting out of humanities programs that don’t appear to deliver sufficient bang for the buck.
Run. Run far, run fast. Don’t waste your 20s and 30s racking up debt, living in poverty, shattering your sense of confidence, and staking your future on a dangerously small number of mentors and colleagues.
And if you go for it anyway, don’t you dare ever claim that nobody warned you. Beowulf April 2, 2019 at 11:51 pm
The moment I knew I was leaving Higher Ed was a moment of incredible relief. Over about a decade I witnessed my discipline descend into crazy-territory. Folks outside of higher ed or who have not been in it for a few years probably have no idea the amount of political indoctrination that we must go through in training under the guise of the therapeutic. The word “safety” has basically been completely coopted.
Check your alma mater and you will find that it probably has some form of mandated Identity Politics curriculum. I promise it ain’t just Villanova. The buzzwords to lookout for are “multicultural” and “diversity”. Follow the trail they create and you’ll find it is not uncommon for universities to mandate that their faculty teach ID Politics in some form.
Do not for one second think that private Christian universities are safe. They are not. If they are not already drinking the ID Politics Kool Aid, there is a good chance they will start soon. Don’t trust them. The only exceptions are schools that refuse Federal funds.
If scholarship in the humanities is going to survive, it will be outside of mainstream universities. It is too depressing for me to recount the fall in standards I witnessed during my brief time in academia, but let’s just say it is bad. Students at major universities cannot write. They are functionally illiterate. I love my students, but it is the truth.
Perhaps Christian Classical schools could be a place for Christian scholars to start new intellectual communities? I fear that even if we aren’t all thrown out of Higher Ed, it is degenerating into something unbecoming of a scholar anyway. Oudeis April 2, 2019 at 11:57 pm
I flunked out of academia because I couldn’t figure out what to write about. I miss the teaching and miss the interesting conversations, but I now work the same hours with much better pay and job security.
As for intellectual life… I don’t have enough time to read now, but I can read whatever I want regardless of its usefulness to a scholarly agenda. I don’t write much, but I can write the way I want, without having to sound like an academic (i.e., awful). And I never have the slightest anxiety about whether my thoughts are original or “relevant”–it only matters whether they’re good, true, and beautiful.
We need communities dedicated to the pursuit of truth. My way of doing it can never have the necessary depth or rigor. But we can’t have communities dedicated to truth if the same communities are also routes to power or wealth like our universities–power and wealth will take over, every time.
So I think the best thing for the pursuit of truth in America would be the success of online education, and the resulting diversion of most students into training/credentialing programs that don’t subsidize scholarly work. The scholarly work that can pay for itself will continue, and the rest will have to find some other way to survive. Much of value will be lost, but the parasitic administrative hierarchies will starve, and the tyrannies of school rankings and competition for students will lose a lot of their power. And somehow, perhaps using some of the vast sums currently squandered on universities, some people will figure out a new way to live the life of the mind. charles cosimano April 3, 2019 at 12:52 am
Academia sucks. Dedicate your life to making lots of money and then when you have an idea, no matter how crazy, people will flock to hear it because they are paid to. The life of the mind is best indulged when you are rich enough that you don’t have to give a damn whether people like you or not. Happy Prof April 3, 2019 at 1:03 am
Depends on your field. I am a tenured faculty member at a large state university in a professional studies field (think nursing, education, criminal justice, etc.) Those of you who are humanities purists may think our preparation lacks rigor, but my students take 12 credits of 200-level math, 8 credits of lab science, US history, geography, and so on…just to get into their major. We turn students away each year because we require a 2.75 GPA, at a school that doesn’t really have grade inflation. Their preparation is far more rigorous than the math, science and history requirements I had to fulfill at my top 25 university 20 years ago. My students, by and large, work their way through school and are serious students…it’s routine for me to get emails on Saturday nights with questions about assignments, because that is when these busy parents or full-time employees, who are *also* carrying 17 credit hours, have time. My tenure process was relatively rigorous (we are not an R1, so lots more emphasis on teaching) but it was not political in the least–there are those in my field whose scholarship tends very much toward the social justice arena, but it’s also entirely possible to get tenure and be highly regarded without that focus. My colleagues are wonderful–generally collegial and kind. I dropped out of a top 10 PhD program in English years ago before I ended up in my current field–one of the best decisions I ever made. I don’t know if I would have a job had I finished in humanities, and I definitely don’t think I’d have enjoyed it as much. Axxr April 3, 2019 at 3:50 am
No, don’t do it.
Would that I had listened to my own mentors as an undergrad, who told me even in the ’90s that I should run a mile in the other direction. Instead, I begged and cajoled and they relented and wrote honest recommendations that landed me at a top university for graduate work.
I earned my Ph.D. I worked on some interesting projects and taught here and there while pursuing an appointment on the track. The pay was terrible, the conditions worse still, particularly considering the workload and what I was being paid. Life stability was nil, and meanwhile I watched my discipline go from one with a “crazy wing” to one in which only those from the crazy wing were seen to be legitimate.
Inquiry and teaching came to be seen as quaint, and even retrogressive. The mission of the “scholar” came to be understood broadly as that of working to perfect the world. We were to be agents of “praxis” and “positive change,” not those who “protect privilege” by settling for inquiry and teaching.
And when I was finally offered a tenure track position, I had to finally face the real music, all ideology and idealism aside. Would I take the pay and the workload knowing that I could earn three to four times more outside of the academy?
It was a very hard decision, particularly knowing that all of my sacrifices had cost me years of my life, not to mention my marriage. But I decided to leave. I regret wasting my youth and a good chunk of my middle age life pursuing something that in the end wasn’t all that attractive anyway.
Young aspirants, don’t be swayed by sepia-colored images of the kindly old professor in mid-century Disney films. This person doesn’t exist any longer, nor does this job description.
To go into academics today, you’ll spend many years of your life giving up everything you could be earning, working very long hours at grunt work, not “inquiry.” You’ll be expected to prove your dedication to the cause by openly sacrificing family and relationships, and if you fail to do so, you’ll be told that it’s clear you’re “not serious” about the calling. And the calling itself has nothing to do with what’s in the books written in your discipline by scholars three or four decades go; the calling now is to be a left activist. If you’re lucky, against very, very steep odds you’ll finally win that position—and be expected to continue to work your fingers to the bone for it while being paid a fraction of what you could earn elsewhere.
And it will dawn on you that you’ve pursued all of this and made all of the sacrifices for poor reward, yet get to spend almost none of your time on the things that interest you, or on doing good work that will endure for future generations.
It’s a terrible industry to be in now, unless you are an activist. If you’re interested in dedicating your life to activism, then by all means, go into academics. Otherwise, stay well clear.
Do something that will be really fulfilling, that will really matter, that will really enable you to pursue your interests, that won’t demand that you prove your dedication by sacrificing self and family, that won’t leave you feeling constantly morally compromised, and that will actually pay your bills. Business Prof April 3, 2019 at 8:09 am
It depends on the field to a large degree. I teach in the business school at a large, private secular university. The job market has been stable for the 15 years I have been in the field (with the exception of some softness in the Great Recession), with roughly a position available for all PhD graduates.
I see some curious nonsense on the student affairs side of things, but overall we do a solid job of practicing pluralism well. I see more nonsense in the businesses I study than I do at my university. BG April 3, 2019 at 8:13 am
The job market is horrendous but if you’re at a top PhD institution and have a good shot of getting a job, I’d say that a job in academia is one of the best jobs there is. I spend my days engaging with super smart people on topics that I care about. My colleagues are dedicated to the liberal arts and ensuring that they flourish. I have the freedom to pursue those research questions that I find meaningful and important. In terms of having a job that is fulfilling, I can’t think of many that are better.
I’m at a school that Rod has mocked for being on the more political end of this diversity and inclusion stuff. But this doesn’t impact my day to day work life, largely because there are few faculty here who are thinking about “diversity” along strictly racial and ethnic lines. (I should add that I teach in our WGS program so it’s not like I’m locked away with test tubes all day). Often conversations about diversity in faculty meetings focus on how to make our more conservative, religious, and low-income students comfortable on campus. We tend to talk about diversity of opinion rather than other forms of diversity. Like Happy Prof above, I have not seen politics intrude into our tenure process or hiring process (and I have been on tons of hiring committees).
And for those who are lauding the STEM fields as free from this sort of stuff, I’d just point out that where I teach its the STEM fields that are leading the charge for more attention to equity and inclusion. I suspect this is the case at other SLACs as well. Egypt Steve April 3, 2019 at 8:14 am
Yes, of course I would. I’ve been working in universities since 1996, and am now a tenured full professor at a flagship midwestern state university in a humanities discipline. The constant whining I read here about SJW’s hijacking education corresponds in no way to my personal experience — not even a little bit. I am left alone to design and teach my courses as I please. Students never stand up to protest anything.
Academia is a great profession if you have the gumption and sticktuitiveness to get a job. To do this, you have to apply nationally, and to every job you think you might be suitable for. You can’t tell yourself you “deserve” the University of Chicago and so refuse to take a job at a local teaching college. Get your foot in the door, find something you love to work on, and then — get to work.
Finally, don’t expect anything to be handed to you. I’ve built up an MA program in my field over the last six years on a shoestring, mostly by being willing to teach lots and lots of extra classes (our obligation here is 2 courses per term; I routinely teach 5 or 6). I apply for grants in an interesting field, I involve my students in my work, and as a result I get my students out of my MA program into major, elite Ph.D. programs (so far one at Hopkins, two at Harvard, two at UCLA, and one at Brown).
It can be done by keeping your eye on the ball, concentrating on your students, and ignoring the static. Marie in Vermont April 3, 2019 at 8:21 am
Carlo:
The hard sciences may not be quite so hard anymore and increasingly unprotected from the wave of woke-ness:
The moral of the story is that even if you’re doing genuine scientific research, your results had better conform to the woke gospel or you’re going to be in a world of trouble with the minders. Diane April 3, 2019 at 8:24 am
Find the kind of university I work at as a staffer: about 5,000 students mostly of blue-collar or rural backgrounds, in a city smaller than 15,000, and at least 90 miles from a major city. Humanities faculty start in the high 40s (plus full benefits), and nice houses can be found for $100,000. If you don’t like church, sports, or family activities, you may be bored, but you can walk to work and travel during the summer.

Lincoln Diocese Comes Clean On Abuse,www.theamericanconservative.com,Rod Dreher,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/lincoln-diocese-sex-abuse-catholic/,"Tweet Bishop James Conley of Lincoln, Nebraska ( EWTN screenshot )
Last summer, in the wake of the McCarrick scandal, Peter Mitchell, a laicized Catholic priest of the Lincoln, Nebraska, diocese, published an essay on this blog in which he alleged that Monsignor Leonard Kalin (d. 2008) had groomed seminarians sexually. This was a bombshell in the conservative diocese, which prided itself on being a bastion of Catholic orthodoxy. Kalin was a legendary figure there. Mitchell, who was laicized following sexual misconduct with women, caught hell for daring to speak out.
But his essay emboldened others to stand up and say #MeToo. One of them was Wan Wei Hsien, a Catholic layman living in Malaysia, who claimed that that Kalin attempted to molest him and others. And then there was the story of the young priest who allegedly caught Kalin protegé Father Charles Townsend in a compromising position with a young male altar server. The diocese sent him off to non-specified treatment, and didn’t tell the parishioners what it was all about. A former parishioner of Father Townsend’s in another Nebraska parish — St. Wenceslaus in Wahoo — came forward with his own story of unwanted sexualized behavior (e.g., following him into the shower at the gym), which I wrote about on this blog. Read about the Townsend allegations here.
Days later, Stan Schulte, a Nebraska chiropractor, came forward to allege that his own uncle, Father Jim Benton, had molested him. It’s a punch to the gut, this story. Schulte also had to deal with blowback from some in the diocese who wished he had kept his mouth shut. From that post from last summer:
Stan Schulte says he personally knows another victim of Father Benton, but that this person is unwilling to come forward at the present time. Schulte alleges that this victim was 14 years old at the time, and it happened when Father Benton was a Lincoln seminarian. Schulte describes the alleged assault, the details of which he asked not be published. It is much like what he says happened to him in his Uncle Jim’s rectory.
According to Schulte, this minor was the first known victim of Uncle Jim. The minor reported it to a priest at the time, but the priest buried the allegation. Says Schulte today, “Had the priest who was told about that reported it at the time, and had the diocese taken action, I wouldn’t have been molested.”
Schulte says that when Father Benton was sent away in 2000, his parish at the time, St. John’s, was told that it was for health issues. This was the same rationale the diocese gave last year to the people of St. Peter’s parish in Lincoln, to explain the sudden disappearance of its pastor, Father Charles Townsend. We now know that Father Townsend had actually been sent for treatment after the assistant pastor, Father Tim Danek, reported him for an incident involving alcohol and inappropriate behavior with a 19-year-old man in the parish.
A chancery culture of deception makes it hard for victims to come forward, says Schulte.
The Schulte story caused others to come forward about Father Benton, and what the diocese, then led by hard-line conservative Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz, knew. Read here.
Today, the Lincoln diocese made an announcement about abuse there. Excerpt:
The diocese published the names of nine priests with substantiated allegations of abuse of minors. This list was developed with the assistance of the Task Force based on a review of the diocesan records related to allegations of sexual misconduct. The Task Force specifically recommended that the diocese publish the names of any diocesan clergy with substantiated allegations.
A “substantiated allegation” is an allegation that, after review of available information, appeared more likely true than not in the judgment of the independent Task Force.
Bishop Conley stated that it was important for victims to see these names made public and that the diocese and community at large acknowledge the pain caused by these priests, “To begin, for those innocent victims that have experienced this very dark chapter in our Church and in our diocese, I apologize on behalf of the diocese. I am releasing these names today with the hope that you can finally begin or deepen the process of healing.
“Another reason for publishing the priests’ names and parishes where they served,” he continued, “is that there may be victims who have not yet come forward. They may now be ready to report to law enforcement and to seek victim assistance and healing from the diocese.”
The list includes Fr. Jim Benton, Fr. Charles Townsend, and Msgr Leonard Kalin . Additionally, the diocese says it is conducting further investigation into Kalin, and invites people with information to get in touch.
Remember, the fact that their names are on this list is not an adjudication of criminal guilt. It simply states that after investigation, the diocese finds that it is more likely than not that they are guilty of the allegations against them. Still, this has to feel like vindication for Peter Mitchell, Wan Wei Hsien, Stan Schulte, and others who dared to speak up last summer. Mitchell, whose TAC essay cracked the façade in Lincoln, received a big share of verbal abuse from people there who damned him for his past sins (which cost him his priesthood), and for airing the Catholic Church’s dirty laundry.
Today, though, thanks to his courage, and the courage of those inspired by him, the Bishop of Lincoln said, on behalf of the diocese, that he believes that Mitchell and the others are telling the truth about what these priests did.
That’s huge. I’m a little emotional about this, I’ll be honest with you, because I know what victims and whistleblowers have to go through, and I know what Mitchell, Schulte, and a Catholic whistleblower whose name I’m keeping private went through to tell the truth. I spent an evening on the phone with Stan Schulte, when he told me his story, listening to him sob about what his uncle did to him, and how much he did not want to hurt his family. From that piece last year:
One striking aspect of my intensely emotional interview with Stan Schulte, in which he broke down crying several times, is his repeated expression of love for priests, loyalty to the Catholic Church, and even love for the uncle he says molested him.
“I’ve lived my whole life loving my uncle,” Schulte says, sobbing. “I think he’s a good person, no matter how deep this problem goes. He hasn’t had anyone to help him. He just kept being moved from parish to parish.”
“I feel like my uncle is unable to even get support from fellow priests in regards to his problem because they too are left in the dark and are not able to show compassion or much-needed support. This, I am sure, makes him feel isolated and alone as well.”
Schulte continues, “There are a lot of amazing priests I respect and love, and I fear some of them don’t have a voice, knowing how much potential corruption there may be above them.”
Schulte was a victim, yet he was grieving over the suffering of his alleged abuser, and of the diocese.
The Nebraska Attorney General continues to investigate the Catholic Church in that state. In February, he subpoenaed sex abuse records from 400 Catholic parishes and institutions in Nebraska.
One more thing: on that Lincoln list released today is Monsignor Clarence Crowley, longtime pastor of the Lincoln cathedral, who died in 1986. Msgr Crowley was a favorite of the late Lincoln Bishop Glennon Flavin, who was the diocesan ordinary from 1965 until his 1992 retirement.
Three sitting bishops today lived and served as priests with Msgr Crowley there at the Lincoln cathedral. They are Bishop Thomas Olmsted of Phoenix; Bishop Michael Owen Jackels of Dubuque; and Bishop Robert Vasa of Santa Rosa, Calif.
What, if anything, did they see while in residence at the cathedral? If they saw Msgr Crowley abusing minors, or if they had reason to believe that he was doing so, did they tell anybody? If not, why not? Somebody should ask them.
UPDATE: A reader, Catholic Kansan, accused me of coming close to libel in that last bit above about what these three now-bishops might have known about the alleged abuser Monsignor Crowley. I adamantly object to that, but reader Loudon Is A Fool gets even deeper:
@Catholic Kansan
Why weren’t they asked before any insinuations were made? These kinds of insinuations instantly condemn people without evidence.
What this ignores is that what Rod writes is what any knowledgable person assumes. The insinuation is laying there drunk and naked and flopping around uncovered in front of our faces as we try to avert our eyes.
These priests and Bishops are like darkly comic Sergeant Schultzes. They know nothing! Bishop Vasa is as orthodox as they come, but he went to seminary at Holy Trinity in Dallas in the mid-70s. He was parochial vicar at the Cathedral of the Risen Christ with Hrdlicka (another guy on the list) for two years when Msg. Crowley was pastor there. None of those coincidences are his fault. Who knows why Bishop Flavin installed Msgr. Kalin as director of vocations and was sending guys to Holy Trinity and assigned Bishop Vasa to serve with a bunch of gay dudes. But to assume that an extremely insightful guy like Bishop Vasa didn’t know what was what seems very unlikely. And what is further troubling, following this history of exposure to various clerics sodomitical and finally in a position where he might not feel coerced to feign blindness, as Bishop of Baker Oregon he defended the employment of a Deacon associated with Urrutigoity’s super gay Society of St. John (the same odd group from whence Fr. Christopher Clay once of Arlington fled).
So for the sake of their own reputations these priests need to speak out. They need to pull back the curtain and call out the corruption. Because when they don’t, they look complicit (or worse). The insinuation exists because of the demonic filth they have elected to ignore. Not because Rod asks whether anyone notices an odor.
UPDATE.2: Another reader e-mails:
Thank you for your articles about the Lincoln Diocese! As a former member of Cathedral, I remember Crowley inviting boys to the rectory. Parents believing Crowley “saw something special in their sons”. “Maybe he’s helping the boys to hear their call to the priesthood”, proudly thought some of them. I know this because it happened in my family, not to me. It makes me sick.
I agree with you that it would be nice to know which bishops knew about Crowley. How could Bruskewitz claim that this didn’t happen in Lincoln? Was he lying? Seems like it! It makes no sense that Peter Mitchell, who became a priest in the late 90s (after Crowley died), would know of these claims against Crowley while the Bishops and most of the other Lincoln priests did not.
Lastly, how could they name the parish hall / CHILDREN’S lunch cafeteria after him – Crowley Hall. Knowing what they knew, in their arrogance, allowed and watched Cathedral parishioners unknowingly use this hall with his name on it!
UPDATE.3: Peter Mitchell comments:
This story continues to cause pain for so many.
I am grateful that Bishop Conley has acknowledged some aspects of the system of cover-up that was and is systemic in the Lincoln Diocese.
The statement yesterday raises many more questions than it answers. Specifically, when did allegations against these priests first come to the attention of the Diocese of Lincoln, and what steps were taken to address them? This information would help people to understand what happened in terms of the greater scandal of cover-up which is the real issue here (not the lesser scandal of sexual misconduct by individual priests). How can the Church learn from what happened in the past — meaning the cover-up for priests in positions of power over other priests — and reform the seminary and clerical system?
While it is true that in the case of deceased priests there is nothing that can be done now to change what they did, it is imperative that the story of how they were covered-up and protected be known, so that the pattern of abuse of power that continues to be systemic in the Catholic clerical system can be truly changed.
Let’s continue to hope that Bishop Conley will choose to be transparent in sharing information that he is privilege to about how cover-up and blackmail have sadly been a part of the Lincoln Diocese’s clerical system for generations now. He and others who hold power must be very afraid of doing this, so we need to pray for him to have courage.
Let’s also pray for so many priests, good and generous men, who are demoralized and discouraged by all of these revelations. They need our prayers.
We must also pray for priests who may have made mistakes in the past, and who are now very afraid of talking about their issues with anyone in Church authority, because they know well that in the current climate they will lose everything they have. Bishops generally do not relate to priests as spiritual fathers, they relate to them as CEOs with legal counsel sitting next to them, treating every priest in trouble as a legal liability. This truth further contributes to priests feeling alone and not knowing who to trust when they do struggle on a personal level.
The truth of the Catholic faith is as true as it ever was. But the Catholic clerical system, which many people have equated with the Catholic faith, has sadly been corrupted to the core. It needs purifying fire that will free the Church from the grip of the demon of self-protection. Those who are asking for the full truth to be told are those who truly love the Church at this hour of her great trial. It is going to be painful for many good and devout Catholic people, including many good priests, to see the corrupt clerical system fall apart. It is going to be difficult to distinguish the clerical system – which is a man-made institution and tradition – from the Catholic faith that comes from Jesus through the Apostles.
Let’s all keep praying for each other. Advertisement"

Villanova Mentholates The Cultural Revolution,www.theamericanconservative.com,Rod Dreher,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/villanova-mentholates-cultural-revolution/,"Tweet You had better — or it will go on your permanent record, Professor ( Kelleher Photography/Shutterstock )
Over the weekend, I posted a link to a Wall Street Journal op-ed by two Villanova professors expressing concern that in its pedal-to-the-metal push for “diversity,” the university was trampling on the heart of a liberal arts education. The professors (James Matthew Wilson and Colleen Sheehan) wrote, in part:
Last fall we were notified by the Villanova administration that new “diversity and inclusion” questions would be added to the course and teaching evaluations that students fill out each semester. In addition to the standard questions about the intellectual worth of the course and the quality of instruction, students are now being asked heavily politicized questions such as whether the instructor has demonstrated “cultural awareness” or created an “environment free of bias based on individual differences or social identities.”
In short, students are being asked to rate professors according to their perceived agreement with progressive political opinion on bias and identity. Students are also invited to “comment on the instructor’s sensitivity to the diversity of the students in the class.” Professors are rated on their “sensitivity” to a student’s “biological sex, disability, gender identity, national origin, political viewpoint, race/ethnicity, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, etc.” The “etc.” in particular seems like an ominous catchall, as if the sole principle of sound teaching has become “that no student shall be offended.”
The president and provost of Villanova have now responded at length — and their response, I believe, fully vindicates the concerns of Sheehan and Wilson. Below is their entire response, which does not refute the Sheehan/Wilson piece, but only mentholates it — that is, uses the language of Human Resources to make what is harsh and intolerable go down smoothly. My own commentary is sprinkled throughout.
There is nothing more central to Villanova’s Catholic, Augustinian identity than our community. When Villanova first opened its door to poor immigrant Irish young men needing an education, a tradition of committed welcome was established. We know at Villanova that such a welcome does not end when we say hello. We know that to be fully a part of our community means to be an essential part of the education offered and practiced.
You may have seen an opinion piece recently published in The Wall Street Journal criticizing the University for including questions on the long-standing course evaluation survey asking students about their perceptions of the classroom experience, including technology, the setting and the quality of instruction. In a time when it is easier, and, for many, more satisfying to paint policies and persons in extreme terms, guided by the history and mission of Villanova University, we would instead offer a different view of this issue, one rooted in the inseparability of truth, unity, and love.
Here we go. When you see phrases like “the inseparability of truth, unity, and love” in a document like this from church leaders, understand that Handsy Uncle Joe is coming in to cop a feel.
More:
The opinion piece portrays this survey as part of a political litmus test, as an aggressive attempt to target faculty with particular views and as an effort opposed to Villanova’s historic Catholic identity and mission. This is untrue. While for some this polarization may be tempting, it fails to offer the kind of perspective that is, and has always been, characteristic of a Villanova education, and the Villanova community as a whole.
Catholic Intellectual tradition is best accomplished through and by a diverse community of scholars and students with a wide variety of viewpoints. Student evaluations are important: Surveying students about their experiences in the classroom is not only a reasonable response, it is the only way to know how well we are meeting the challenge of creating an authentically diverse community of scholars.
More anaesthetic human resources talk. The precise claim by Sheehan and Wilson is that these surveys allow students to rate their professors according to ideological categories that have nothing to do with the subject matter. Their argument is not that students should not be surveyed as a general matter; it’s that these particular questions on the student surveys turn students into ideological monitors of their professors’ political correctness.
It gets worse:
At Villanova we value the voices of each community member. We celebrate hearing and listening to everyone’s thoughts and opinions, which embody a wide spectrum of perspectives. Diversity and inclusion are not accessories in higher education today, they are at its core. We know that it is through dialogue between respectful colleagues that differences are resolved and progress toward understanding made. When different voices are included in important conversations, new insights are reached, and discoveries can begin. In today’s society, all Villanovans must be prepared to live, thrive, and work effectively across and through the lines of difference.
Stop right there. “Diversity and inclusion” are at the core of higher education?! What an extraordinary admission! They are proud of politicizing the university’s mission. Villanova’s administration has re-defined the university’s purpose to include indoctrinating students into a particular ideological worldview. Sheehan and Wilson, in their op-ed, objected that this is a de facto way of getting rid of dissenting professors. If a professor is judged by students to be insufficiently “diverse” in her teaching, she can then be accused of not doing her job — this, no matter how good her scholarship and instruction is.
More:
We are greatly concerned that the op-ed fails to accurately or adequately characterize the nature of a liberal arts education, and especially such an education as it occurs here at Villanova. The authors suggest that a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is antithetical to a liberal arts education, and this is a position we firmly reject.
Wrong, and unfair. They object to how Villanova defines these terms, and how it applies those definitions to teaching.
More:
Our Catholic Augustinian Mission Statement insists that “to foster academic excellence, we as a University: create a diverse community of scholars, united and dedicated to the highest academic standards.” Villanova, as a faith-based institution, takes this claim seriously, recognizing that there is no conflict between academic standards and the values of unity and love, our academic mission and our Catholic heritage.
Note the language here: “unity and love” and “our Catholic heritage.” These are phrases meant to sugarcoat something that ordinary people would object to if they had it put to them straightforwardly.
More:
As a result, we believe that a Villanova education must not simply address questions of fact, but also questions of the linkages between knowledge, perspective, and action. We advance a deeper understanding of the relationship between faith and reason. To foster knowledge without a concern for human connection, or absent a concern for how such knowledge can “ignite change” in our communities is, simply put, inadequate and hollow.
There you have it: the purpose of education is instrumental, to “‘ignite change’ in our communities.” It seems to me that Sheehan and Wilson have accurately characterized what Villanova’s administration intends to do: turn its classrooms into factories to educate Social Justice Warriors. After all, as a famous philosopher’s epitaph reads:
That’s Karl Marx’s gravestone in London, by the way. I don’t bring him up in this context gratuitously or to be inflammatory, or to take a cheap shot. The leadership at Villanova really is proposing to change the purpose of the Catholic university’s approach to education in a radical way. It’s doing so using the moralistic, therapeutic language of the Human Resources department, but make no mistake: something revolutionary is going on here.
Here’s more from the Villanova president and provost:
Yet, even more hollow is an education wherein these concerns over truth, unity, and love are ignored in one’s own community. As an academic institution committed to excellence, we challenge ourselves every day to prove it.
“Truth, unity, and love”— keep these in mind, Villanovans. You are going to be hearing this mantra repeated many times over the course of this controversy.
More:
We do this through our faculty’s research efforts, which are reshaping knowledge in a variety of fields, and making critical interventions in contexts and communities across the globe.
We do this through our students, who meet the challenge of excellence by winning postgraduate awards like the Fulbright, finding meaningful employment or postgraduate study, and, in all ways, truly use their Villanova education to ignite change.
And, yes, we do this through embracing thoughtful pedagogy that recognizes that knowledge creation is part of the dynamic exchange among and between perspectives.
Gobbledygook, all designed to distract from the specific concerns of Sheehan and Wilson.
More:
Our work is not to eliminate perspectives, as suggested by the op-ed, but to be carefully attentive to ours and others’ perspectives. It is only through such communal, caring engagement that our students and teachers can exemplify the teachings and wisdom of St. Augustine.
This is flat-out wrong. Of course the work is to “eliminate perspectives”— the perspectives of any professor or instructor who diverges from the administration’s highly politicized concept of “diversity” and “inclusion,” as judged by students in their evaluations. Why have the evaluations at all if the administration wasn’t prepared to act on the information gathered by them? This is all about compelling scholars to be conformists. The idea that St. Augustine would in any way approve of this ideological chicanery is truly shameless.
Ready for some more? Because you’re going to get it:
Also missing in the op-ed is the thoughtful, planned process that led to the creation and addition of three questions to the regularly administered course evaluations. Through a process that began with student input, then moved through the administration for formation and then to the faculty for evaluation and shaping, three questions were added to the survey. After pilot testing and more evaluation, the questions were added to the standard survey form. Even after the addition of these to the evaluation form, we continue to solicit faculty and student feedback on these questions, and also examine the patterns evident in students’ responses to them. Indeed, we have been quite pleased to note that students at Villanova overwhelmingly rated their faculty at the very top of the scale.
So what? The fact that the university thoughtfully and carefully put together this program has nothing to do with whether or not it is good . The United States thoughtfully and carefully put together a plan to go to war against Iraq. The thought and care that went into devising the scheme did not make it right.
More:
Although the op-ed makes it appear as though we are using this tool to evaluate faculty for employment decisions and identify faculty members’ beliefs, the purpose is actually to provide guidance for internal self-improvement.
“Professor Smith, your student evaluations indicate that you are not bringing diverse and inclusive perspectives to bear in your medieval philosophy class. What do you intend to do about that?”
“Nothing. I teach medieval philosophy.”
“But professor, we would like you to improve yourself professionally by adding diverse and inclusive perspectives. The students are not seeing themselves reflected in your teaching.”
“I don’t get it. I’m teaching them about medieval philosophy. What would it mean to ‘see yourself’ in medieval philosophy? These students don’t know anything about medieval philosophy — that’s why they’re taking this class!”
“Professor, calm down. If our graduates are to ignite change in the world, then they must be able to grasp the relevance of what they study to their own lives. Why do you insist on ignoring this?”
“Look, you want me to queer Thomas Aquinas, don’t you? You’re serious about this.”
“Yes, we are. Please contact Katie Grimes in our theology department for advice on how to do that. You will find that her scholarly work shows the way into how we can bring queer perspectives to bear on our understanding of Scholasticism. She once wrote a paper on how Aquinas can come out of the closet.”
“I’m sorry, that’s daft.”
“Professor, I’m sorry to hear you say that. When your tenure evaluation comes up, your file will note that you oppose truth, unity, and love, and object to one of the core missions of higher education. It will also be noted that you stand in opposition to the Catholic intellectual tradition, and indeed to St. Augustine.”
More:
The survey questions themselves were generated from the community and provide evidence that our classrooms are spaces where faculty and students are embodying Villanova’s ideals every day.
This is not easy work; but it is the work that stands as the foundation of a civil society. We are far from being the perfect model in this endeavor. There are ways in which we must continue to reflect upon our failings and then strive to rectify them. But our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is not among them. On the contrary, Villanova University stands as a great educational institution because of our commitment to difference and the authentic community we create.
We come to Villanova and learn the words Veritas, Unitas, Caritas. We live Villanova when we place Truth, Unity, and Love at the core of who we are.
Sincerely,
Rev. Peter M. Donohue, OSA, PhD President
Patrick G. Maggitti, PhD Provost
Truth, Unity, and Love™. Folks, this is a con. This is a cultural revolution hollowing out the meaning of the humanities, and a liberal arts education — and demonizing opponents as enemies of Truth, Unity, and Love, as well as the Catholic intellectual tradition, and St. Augustine. Don’t be taken in by the soothing language! The Donohue and Maggitti response, sent out to the Villanova community and alumni, vindicates the WSJ op-ed.

Mike Pompeo Has No Excuse,www.theamericanconservative.com,Daniel R. DePetris,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/mike-pompeo-has-no-excuse/,"Mike Pompeo Has No Excuse The secretary of state has accomplished almost nothing. At least Rex Tillerson could blame the president. Credit: lev radin/Shutterstock
When Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the rounds on Capitol Hill last week to explain the Trump administration’s latest State Department budget request, he got a beating from both sides of the aisle. The request, a 21 percent reduction in funding from the previous fiscal year, was dead on arrival for members of the House Foreign Affairs and Appropriations committees. The same man who promised to bring “swagger” back to U.S. diplomacy was now trying to justify a $13 billion reduction to the department’s accounts. Members of Congress simply couldn’t square the circle.
House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, not known for his brashness, was livid. “I don’t know whether this administration really believes we can mount an effective foreign policy…on a shoestring budget, or if the people calling the shots just don’t care,” he surmised . “But Congress won’t stand by and see American leadership on the global stage undermined.” Congressman Mike McCaul, the ranking Republican who is normally a defender of the administration, was just as aghast and vowed to “plus up” the request. And Congressman Hal Rogers, the former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, called the budget “ detached from reality. ”
If this were the first time Pompeo had attempted to put lipstick on the pig of a State Department cut, perhaps Republicans and Democrats alike would have excused it as an anomaly. But last year, he did the same thing: in fact, the meat ax he asked for was even larger . Lawmakers were just as contemptuous of those numbers as they are with the current figures. It appeared to many that America’s top diplomat was devaluing diplomacy as a core component of U.S. foreign policy.
In all fairness, it’s unfair to judge dedication to diplomacy on budget numbers alone. Like all departments and agencies of the federal government, the State Department is not immune to wasteful spending. In a way, Pompeo deserves some credit for realizing that more money doesn’t necessarily yield better results. Yet as the old saying goes, the numbers don’t lie. The Trump administration’s $42.8 billion State Department budget is peanuts compared to a Pentagon bureaucracy that remains a cash-eating machine (Trump wants $750 billion for the military this year alone). Advertisement
American foreign policy is in a prime position for a significant adjustment away from military solutions. But in order for that shift to happen, the defense budget either needs to go down substantially or the State Department budget needs to be reinforced.
Pompeo is either a firm believer in these cuts or tried and failed to change Trump’s mind during inter-agency deliberations. Neither of those scenarios reflect particularly well on him as the leader of American diplomacy.
Were Pompeo out there promoting reasonable diplomatic resolutions to difficult global problems, the kerfuffle over the budget could perhaps be forgiven (Congress, after all, was always likely to discard the administration’s proposal in favor of its own). But on any number of foreign policy priorities, Pompeo has acted more like a playground bully than a diplomat trying to find openings for success. As State Department veterans Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky write in Politico , Pompeo “has proven far more adept at managing Trump than U.S. foreign policy and has embraced an ideological and uncompromising hard line that aligns with his own temperament, convictions and perhaps his presidential ambitions in the Republican Party.”
That perfectly sums up Pompeo’s diplomatic style to date, which has revolved around a no compromise approach to U.S. adversaries and a tone deaf, tough love approach to its partners and allies. Rex Tillerson was pilloried throughout his one-year tenure at Foggy Bottom for his lack of concrete results—a criticism that was frequently unfair given constant interventions by the likes of senior White House advisor Jared Kushner and the president’s own Twitter account. Pompeo, however, has a close relationship with Trump and his team but has nonetheless been unable to make headway on issues as diverse as holding Saudi Arabia accountable, ending the civil war in Yemen, denuclearizing North Korea, and managing Washington’s relationships with the Europeans. Tillerson at least had the excuse of being undercut by people in the White House. Having glad-handed the president at every opportunity and all but categorized him as the messiah of the modern era, Pompeo can’t use the same pretext. Mike Pompeo's Iran Obsession
Granted, nothing in the secretary of state portfolio is easy—particularly for someone like Pompeo, who came into the job with far less diplomatic experience than previous secretaries like Jim Baker, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, and even Condoleezza Rice. But diplomacy is the art of the possible, and in Pompeo’s case, possible solutions are typically waved away as weakness, insufficiently indicative of America’s power, or, dare I say, appeasement.
If Pompeo was interested in good-enough solutions, for instance, he wouldn’t be browbeating the Europeans to cut off all foreign trade with Iran—despite the fact that they’ve made it abundantly clear from the outset that they have no intention of tearing up the Iran nuclear deal. He would not continue to peddle the fiction that Saudi Arabia is doing its due diligence as it continues to prosecute an air war in Yemen that kills an abominable number of civilians. (On March 26, the Saudi-led coalition hit a gas station near a hospital in a remote part of Yemen’s northern countryside, shutting down the facility and killing seven people in the process.) Nor would he continue to go along with the fantasy of North Korea’s immediate denuclearization, an objective about as unrealistic as the New York Mets wining the World Series this year.
Nobody said being the secretary of state was going to be smooth sailing. It’s easy for those of us in the peanut gallery to yell and scream. Indeed, there is plenty Pompeo wouldn’t be able to do even if he was a negotiating savant; the world has a funny way of throwing twists and turns between points A and B. America’s adversaries get a vote, every state is driven by its own interests, and sometimes diplomacy falls short when the respective parties are not prepared to sit down and deal. But it’s up to Pompeo in his role as the leader of U.S. diplomacy to recognize when opportunities arise, when it’s time for a stick, or when carrots are the better tool to safeguard U.S. interests. To date, carrots have been missing from his repertoire.
We don’t know how long Pompeo will be on the job. As he joked a few weeks ago, there may come a time when he finds out through Twitter that Trump has decided to move on, a la Tillerson and the toilet. Or Pompeo could leave on his own terms, choosing to get back into the political game.
Yet for as long as he’s sitting in the secretary’s suite, Pompeo needs to prioritize statesmanship over politics and sucking up to the boss. Otherwise, the former congressman from Kansas will set a dangerous precedent for any successor, one that says going along to get along is a better way to pad one’s career prospects than telling the president the honest truth about what is and is not possible.

The Great Awokening Preceded The Trumpening,www.theamericanconservative.com,Rod Dreher,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/great-awokening-preceded-trumpening-racial-politics/,"lizzy1980
The Accurate:
Most white liberals, however, began to see more clearly the racial injustice in this society during the Obama years… Worse yet, the unpunished killing of so many unarmed black people by police or fellow citizens magnified some of the experiential differences among races.
In most of those cases, the “unarmed black people” were attacking the people who shot them, and the lying media portrayed those shot as being innocent victims. And the response to not getting the verdict they wanted was, in at least one case (Ferguson), the mass destruction of property and murder (see Zemir Begic).
Of course, white conservatives believe the converse to be true, but it’s hard to argue with the studies and the lived experiences that show liberals view to be more accurate.
Uh-huh.
That is, most people and most studies show that life in the U.S. as a white male is, in general, better than life as a black male. Race, in and of itself, may not be the direct cause of this disparity in all cases, but the fact that the disparity is racial in nature argues against a claim by white conservatives that they are disfavored in society.
Of course, the underlying assumption here is that differences in quality of life between blacks and whites is primarily driven by societal favor, and not by their own behavior. Gretchen April 3, 2019 at 1:55 am
I disagree that you can’t blame Trump. He’s been working to enhance racial divisiveness, and he’s been successful. There have been more hate crimes in places where he’s had rallies than in places he hasn’t. Here in Kansas City, a guy shot two Indian men, employees of Garmin, killing one. Shortly after that, my daughter wanted to bring her Indian-American fiance home to meet the family. His mother was understandably worried. What could I say? Don’t worry, two men who look just like your son were shot here because of how they look? It will be fine? She admonished her son to wear his crucifix prominently to show that he’s a Christian. I didn’t want to point out to her that someone who would shoot people for their looks wouldn’t be troubled by a nicety like a cross. I worried the whole time they were here, wishing they would safely stay home. Trump has been driving this divisiveness and suspicions of people who look different. My son-in-law is American-born, a citizen with a New York accent, but in the eyes of the Kansas City gunman, he’s an illegal, an invader, a danger to the dominance of white people. He’s an American, but he is unmistakably different, of Indian descent. He can’t blend in, and Trump doesn’t want to let him blend in. Trump’s determination to keep him from blending in makes him and my daughter less safe. I can’t forgive that.

Matt in VA says:
I understand why Yglesias goes to Black Lives Matter, but I don’t think that was the really meaningful moment.
In my opinion, the really meaningful occurrence/phenomenon was Angela Merkel throwing open the borders to whoever of the 7 billion people on the planet could make it to Europe in 2015. That definitely made me sit up and pay attention, and I remember at that time watching the behavior and reactions of A) liberals/the left; B) Respectable Conservatives; and C) non-respectable right-wingers.
[…]
My sense is that there was a huge break and smash on the Right at that time. The reason you have people like Tucker Carlson openly repudiating, what, 80% of Reaganite conservative orthodoxy on Fox News every night is because suddenly it became clear what was really at stake. Nothing at all similar occurred on the left, in the sense of a smashup, as far as I can tell — it was basically universal support for open borders, which was of course incredibly meaningful in its own right — so that may be why Yglesias points to Black Lives Matter as the thing that lit the fuse. But black opposition to police/police misconduct/strong concerns about the justice system/bad police vs. citizen relationships are nothing new. Whereas Merkel throwing the borders open really was a moment where we saw, happening in real time, where liberalism is leading us.
You are talking about a meaningful moment for you and the right, while Yglesias is talking about a meaningful moment for those on the left. I agree with Yglesias and also those on the left here who point to the immediate reaction on the right to Obama’s election. BLM seemed like a turning point for liberal boomers to me, while the reaction to Obama’s election seemed like a turning point for liberal millennials.
I had a number of conversations with lefty boomers after the Ferguson report where they were like: “We had no idea things were like this, we thought we had made so much progress.” BLM clearly succeeded in bringing their prime issue to the attention of white liberals in a big way no matter how much they alienated conservatives in the process.
The reaction to Obama, who most on the left viewed as a centrist looking to compromise, made pretty much every liberal millennial I know decide that there was no point in ever bothering to try to compromise with Republicans.
JonF says:
Matt in VA, I’ve never heard anyone in real life talk about Angela Merkel. A huge number of people probably have no idea who she is. Americans mostly think the sun rises in the Atlantic and sets in the Pacific. The domestic brouhahas of other nations barely penetrate here unless somehow Americans get mixed up in it (e.g., Iran 1979).
I think Fox or some non-internet based conservative media must have really been pushing Merkel’s moves in Germany as part of their narrative, because I remember being shocked to hear some of my octogenarian relatives going on about it when I’d never heard them have any interest in the goings on in Europe before (except maybe something about freedom fries…).
KD says:
I think the Obama Presidency was important to the transition on the Left in the sense that here you have a Black man elected President.
Effectively, that meant that any Black kid born in America, if they had talent and ambition, could rise to any position they aspired to achieve, and whatever obstacles racism posed, it did not meaningfully prevent them from realizing their dreams.
This argument is the mirror image of Kevin Williamson’s take down of the “white working class” – you have nothing to complain about because there is proof that success is possible for you if you are extremely capable and ambitious. Neither Obama’s success nor Williamson’s are proof that we shouldn’t bother trying to make a more equitable world for browned skinned folk and pink skinned folks. JonF April 3, 2019 at 6:23 am
Re: In most of those cases, the “unarmed black people” were attacking the people who shot them,
Mike Brown, OK, and maybe Trayvon Martin (we don’t know who initiated that fracas beyond a reasonable doubt). But there are too many others who were shot just on mere suspicion that they might, maybe be up to no good. Trigger happy cops are a danger to all of us and we should be able to agree that “Shoot first, ask questions later” is not acceptable practice outside an actual battlefield.

Re: while his birth in Hawaii means he was a natural-born U.S. citizen, he didn’t spend his culture and identity forming childhood in the United States, but was raised and educated in Muslim countries just as a citizen there
So what? That’s no part of the definition of “native born citizen” nor is it what the idiot Birthers were talking about. Moreover Obama speaks American English without a trace of foreign accent which very clearly points to his core cultural formation being American.
Re: When true Diversity comes to America, expect some fundamental changes to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

Yesterday where I live we had a special State Senate election in which a white female (D) defeated a brown male (R) in a fairly close race. My guess is that the issue of race will not be brought up much in post-election analysis because the “woke” candidate won. If, however, a Dem person of color had defeated a white Republican you’d never hear the end of it.
It’s also notable that a great number of Trump-supporting whites, both white- and blue-collar, felt perfectly fine in voting for a dark-skinned first-generation immigrant with a funny name.

Hmm – of course, “the color-blind vision of America” is itself, intensely racist.
The assumption we should all ignore the racial identity of people that our eyes clearly show us, is a racial construct that strives to achieve ‘one coffee colored people’ globally.
Ironically, success at this color-blind goal ensures the diversity of the worlds races and cultures, with all their distinct beauty, gets blended into a mush of sameness.
It is a virtuous good to treat all people of all races & ethnicities fairly and equally, naturally (how else could we love our neighbour as we love God – the prime commandment?); I simply suggest we should not strive to blend away our differences.
In that sense, you may wish to reflect on how Chinese parents would react if their child came home with your white child as a date? With joy for a ‘one world’ future? Or distress at the potential dilution of their Chinese culture their grandkids may experience by having mixed ethnic parents? I heard this distress fist-hand when my white cousin married a (fantastic) ethnic minority guy, whose parents bemoaned to me that he should have married a girl from his own ethicity.
Please note I am not suggesting mixed race or ethnic relationships are wrong – I have them in my family. Just that (as in Villanove University’s diversity & inclusion goals 😉 ) color blind relationships should not be our *goal*.
In this sense, liberals are correct about identity politics to some extent – there is value in respecting our differences as this is what makes up the interesting variety of the world, including varieties of peoples.
The latter part of your parental dating advice is good Rod: “we’ve told our kids that we don’t care about the color or ethnic background of anyone they date, as long as their potential mates are serious Christians and have good character” , but I would gently suggest that telling your kids you ‘don’t care’ about the ethnicity of who they date is an implicit devaluing of your kids own ethnicity.
It is natural for people to prefer their own culture & people (God made it so after the tower of babylon) – when parents don’t seem to care about their own ethnic community’s people, culture, history, etc being perpetuated through marriage & kids, then we get the sense of (European) ethnic inferiority Douglas Murray writes of in his ‘Strange Death of Europe’ book. Which no ethnicity but Europeans seem to suffer from… due to the hippy era color-blind theory.
Just stick to your kids being told to date a ‘serious Christian of good character’; only raise race if racial discrimination occurs. Otherwise, you are pre-emptively positively discriminating, which as we have seen from the woke, can lead to inadvertent self-hatred (of straight white men, mostly, it seems).
Ahh, fun times to be alive 😉 Love people the way God made em – both sexes, all ethnicities/nations, but aim for conformity in us all loving God! Matt in VA"

Zacks Investment Research cut shares of Mcdonald’s (NYSE:MCD) from a hold rating to a sell rating in a report published on Tuesday, Zacks.com reports.
According to Zacks, “Shares of McDonald’s have underperformed the industry in the past three months. High labor costs and currency headwinds remain major concerns. Moreover, revenues have been under pressure for quite some time due to strategic refranchising initiatives. Even its heightened focus on refranchising might cut the capital requirements and facilitate EPS growth. McDonald’s margins have been under pressure from worldwide wage increases. However, McDonald’s impressive earnings surprise history, various sales and digital initiatives as well as positive comparable sales bode well. In fact, global comps at McDonald’s have been positive over the trailing 14 quarters. Furthermore, increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the United States should boost its performance. These apart, efforts to drive growth in International Lead & High Growth Markets bode well.” Get Mcdonald's alerts:

Senate panel advances bill penalizing illegal robocalls,thehill.com,ebirnbaum@thehill.com (Emily Birnbaum),04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/437117-senate-panel-advances-bill-to-penalize-illegal-robocalls,"Senate panel advances bill penalizing illegal robocalls By Emily Birnbaum - 04/03/19 10:06 AM EDT A Senate panel on Wednesday advanced legislation that would levy a hefty fine on illegal robocalls, the latest congressional effort to crack down on the billions of unwanted calls that irritate U.S. consumers every year. Lawmakers on the Senate Commerce Committee approved the bill in 26-0 vote. The measure's co-sponsors include Sen. Amy Klobuchar ADVERTISEMENT The Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act, introduced by Sens. John Thune Edward (Ed) John Markey Hillicon Valley — Presented by CTIA and America's wireless industry — House panel approves bill restoring net neutrality | FTC asks for more help to police tech | Senate panel advances bill targeting illegal robocalls Ocasio-Cortez responds to Trump calling her a 'young bartender': The 'last guy who underestimated me lost' Senate panel advances bill penalizing illegal robocalls MORE (D-Mass.), would give the federal government the authority to slap offenders with fines of up to $10,000 per call. It also would give the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) more time to bring charges against companies behind illegal robocalls, lengthening the statute of limitations from one to three years. The telecom industry would be required under the legislation to take stronger action against “spoofing,” a practice where robocallers make it look like they are calling from a number in the recipient's area code.
“As nearly half of all calls to mobile phones this year will be robocalls, this legislation can’t get signed into law soon enough,” Thune said during the hearing. “The TRACED Act is a bipartisan act that targets the worst of the worst.”
Markey called the vote “historic.”
“Today, the committee did just take a historic step towards finally ending the deluge of unwanted and intrusive robocalls bombarding millions of consumers across our country on a daily basis,” Markey said. Lawmakers during the previous Congress held three hearings and passed 13 bills aimed at curtailing robocalls, but the measure advanced by the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday is the most significant piece of legislation to address the issue. U.S. residents received an estimated 26 billion robocalls last year, with a quarter of those from illegal robocallers, according to an industry estimate cited by The Washington Post on Tuesday. The Federal Trade Commission and FCC have said the most complaints they receive pertain to “unwanted and illegal robocalls.” But critics say the two agencies have not done enough to address the issue, as the number of unwanted calls has climbed significantly in recent years. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai last month warned phone service providers that if they don't crack down on ""spoofed"" caller IDs from robocallers, the agency will “consider regulatory intervention.""
