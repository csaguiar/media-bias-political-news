Mark Zuckerberg Calls for Government Regulation of Political Speech on Facebook - Hit & Run : Reason.com,reason.com,qoheleth,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/blog/2019/04/05/mark-zuckerberg-calls-for-government-reg#comment_7748628,"""But the current laws around what is political advertising don't consider discussion issues to be political.""
Actually, that's not true. They just rightfully don't consider them advertising.
A free discussion of issues is vital for a functioning democratic republic. Limiting discussion of issues because there are people who misuse those discussions to cause strife is like limiting any other discussion because there are Internet Trolls.
What needs to be done is to find a way to limit the effects of trolling. That's not something government does well. Government does one-size-is-equally-uncomfortable-for-all well, but not attention to complexity and specifics.
A variety of venues, each developing their own ways of dealing with trolling is how the Internet got to where it is. I can understand why Z doesn't want a variety of venues but the defacto monopolies are more of a problem than any attempts by extra-nationals to troll elections."

And now he thinks he can predict climate change. Climate change is what has always happened, and always will. The factors driving climate change are infinitely complex, cannot be defined, cannot be measured in any meaningful way, and cannot be controlled.
The idea behind ""climate change"" is that humans are hurting the environment and must be controlled. Just find the right experts to tell you how, and choose the right politicians and dictators to direct our lives. What a sucker's game! Climate change will happen and humans will have to adapt to survive and to thrive. No need for government interference, which will only hinder success and impoverish and enslave us.
""Climate change"" won't happen in our lifetimes, government policies will affect our freedoms but not control the environment, and anyone who thinks they can predict or direct climate futures will be proven wrong. The world is complex and no one should be put in charge of coping with change."

Plants have been sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere for about 2 billion years and that already caused one great die off when global O2 levels exploded from nothing to 20% of the atmosphere, so it's not unprecedented that plants can change the atmosphere drastically enough to affect all life on the planet.
CO2 reached dangerous lows going from 0.2% of the atmosphere 200 million years ago to 0.028%, that's an 86% reduction in CO2. Plant life needs a minimum of .018% of CO2 in the atmosphere for photosynthesis, so we were only 0.01% or 100ppm away from an environmental calamity. It certainly wouldn't be the first time some life form caused itself to die off because it consumed all of its available food supply, but if plant life goes, all of us go with them
Thank God, humanity discovered where the plants hid a lot of that carbon in coal and oil and converted it to life sustaining CO2 in order to keep the planet healthy and reduce our margin of error for CO2 starvation."
