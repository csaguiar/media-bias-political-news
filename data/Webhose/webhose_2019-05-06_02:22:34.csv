ILPS condemns Duterte for slander and intimidation | Fight Back!,www.fightbacknews.org,Statement,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.fightbacknews.org/2019/4/7/ilps-condemns-duterte-slander-and-intimidation,"ILPS condemns Duterte for slander and intimidation Statement by Jose Maria Sison Philippines
Fight Back News Service is circulating the following April 5 statement from Prof. Jose Maria Sison, Chairperson, International League of Peoples’ Struggle.
The International League of Peoples’ Struggle (ILPS), which I represent as Chairperson of the International Coordinating Committee (ICC), hereby condemns in the strongest terms the attempt of the notorious Duterte regime to slander the ILPS and misrepresent it as the international network and International Department of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) for the purpose of intimidating the legal and patriotic and progressive organizations of Filipinos in the Philippines and abroad.
Contrary to the false claim of the Duterte regime, the ILPS is a broad alliance of hundreds of anti-imperialist and democratic mass organizations in scores of countries from all continents. The ICC, its supreme leading organ, is elected by the International Assembly and is restricted by the ILPS Charter from having more than three members from the same country, thus preempting control of the ILPS by any single country or organization.
The Duterte regime’s attack on the ILPS is an extension of the anticommunist witch hunt, state terrorism and fascisation being carried out by the regime in the Philippines. It is meant to attain certain malicious objectives, such as the following:
1) To red-tag and intimidate the ILPS and also to vainly reinforce its previous red tagging of legal patriotic and even religious organizations that are critical of the gross and systematic violations of human rights being perpetrated by Duterte.
2) To mislead world public opinion and deflect attention from the complaints on human rights violations already submitted to the International Criminal Court by aggrieved victims and survivors of human rights violations, who cannot obtain justice from Philippine courts which are now under the draconian control of the tyrant Duterte.
3) To blame the legal patriotic and progressive organizations and even religious organizations for supposedly causing the self-generated notoriety of the tyrannical, murderous and corrupt Duterte regime.
In the first place, the Duterte regime must be aware of its own crimes. Since he became president, Duterte no less has been publicly inciting and ordering the police to frame up and kill suspected drug users and peddlers in the thousands and assuring his armed minions of presidential protection and rewards in cash and promotions. Thus, more than 30,000 people have been extrajudicially killed in the fake war on illegal drugs undertaken by Duterte to monopolize the illegal drug trade.
The international and human rights agencies and organizations have been factual and truthful in their reporting of the mass murders and other human rights violations. Thus, Duterte is the subject of complaints to the International Criminal Court in The Hague by aggrieved Filipinos who cannot seek justice from the Philippines state because of Duterte’s unbridled brutality and tight grip on the judicial system.
Those being red-tagged by the Duterte regime include highly and widely respected Philippine organizations, like the IBON Research Foundation, GABRIELA, Alliance of Concerned Teachers, KARAPATAN, and the National Union of People’s Lawyers (NUPL), and religious formations like the Rural Missionaries of the Philippines and the Iglesia Independiente Filipina (Philippine Independent Church).
The Duterte regime is maliciously spreading the big lie that its criminal ill repute or notoriety is because of the advocacy and social activism of the aforesaid organizations in support of the poor, exploited, and oppressed people and that these are merely CPP “front” or dummy organizations, which are used for raising funds abroad.
On their own account, the CPP and New People’s Army have time and again asserted and manifested their political, organizational and financial self-reliance because they enjoy the vigorous participation and abundant support of the people in the revolutionary struggle for national liberation, democracy, social justice, and all-round development.
Acting as the psywar agent of the Duterte regime, AFP Major General Parlade has gone to several countries in Europe and Southeast Asia to red-tag and slander the ILPS as a conduit of foreign funds for the CPP and revolutionary movement. He has done so at a time that the AFP is applying the brutal methods of Oplan Tokhang in Oplan Kapayapaan and escalating the selective and mass murders of people suspected of being linked to the New People’s Army.
Previously, it was another Duterte running dog, PNP General Albayalde who red-tagged the patriotic and progressive organizations on the outright lie that I identified them as CPP “front” organizations by maliciously misrepresenting a 1987 video, in which I sharply differentiated the forces of the armed revolutionary movement from the legal patriotic and progressive forces that had directly brought down the Marcos fascist dictatorship in 1986.

"After attacking Trump supporters personally, AOC decries personal attacks on Ilhan Omar, links to threats",therightscoop.com,SooperMexican,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://therightscoop.com/after-attacking-trump-supporters-personally-aoc-decries-personal-attacks-on-ilhan-omar-links-to-threats/,"Email 1
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez either has the memory of a goldfish, or she’s just willfully hypocritical whenever she can manage it. Or both, I guess.
IN any case, here she is blaming Jeanine Pirro’s criticism of Ilhan Omar for the death threats that have been made against her: Understand when Jeanine Pirro goes on Fox + rallies people to think hijabs are threatening, it leads to this.Folks who imply we’re “bad” for politics, the party, the country, etc. have no idea the threats we deal w/ because of that kind of language.Talk policy, not personal. https://t.co/udFg3LMdgB — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 7, 2019
Now, don’t pay attention to the fact that it was Ocasio-Cortez who has been accusing all Trump supporters of racism and white supremacy and anything else she can think of. So isn’t that a tad bit hypocritical? The answer is yes.
To be fair, Pirro’s comments were irresponsible. Especially when there are Sikhs who also wear similar head covering and have nothing to do with Islam.
Here’s the death threat she was talking about:
Ocasio-Cortez was responding to the arrest of a man in New York who is accused of making death threats against Omar.
Prosecutors have said Patrick Carlineo’s arrest stems from a phone call he made last month to Omar’s office.
“Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her? She’s a f—ing terrorist. I’ll put a bullet in her f—ing skull,” Carlineo allegedly said during the call.
I don’t have a problem with her criticizing the more extreme or irrational attacks on Omar, because there are some. But she doesn’t distinguish between those and reasonable criticism. So what that means is that she just wants all debate shut down. She doesn’t want to hear dissent from her position. And that is what we call totalitarianism, people. Total: 69"

The Canadian government under Justin Trudeau is undermining not just Canada’s (ok, undeserved) reputation as an honest, fair mediator, but he has chosen 2019 to make Canada the enabler of the worst of US imperial policies.
Yes, the Huawei debacle is an embarrassment that will be remembered more as a joke, though possibly as the Suez Crisis of the US empire. Whatever. Canada to the rescue! And of course, Canada reviles Islamic Iran, while shedding crocodile tears for the 50 Muslims murdered last week in New Zealand.
But the far more despicable, downright ‘war-crime’ territory is Canada’s role in undermining the Venezuelan socialist government. The US war on Venezuela has been ongoing ever since Hugo Chavez miraculously survived a US-backed coup in 2002. Canada has been a minor irritant to the socialists, but not the villain. Until now.
The scenario is a variation on Eisenhower in Iran 1953 and from Reagan on, JFK in Cuba 1961, Nixon in Chile 1973. Same use of an angry old elitist fury that the common people were finally getting some justice. The current attempt at overthrowing the socialists is in full swing: total boycott, a lying media shrilly howling for President Maduro’s resignation, sabotage.
Canadian computer villains
Cyber warfare is use of computers, which can be hacked and infected with viruses. US-Israel developed the Stuxnet virus as a cyber weapon to sabotage Iran’s nuclear power program in 2010. Iran miraculously survived this — and 40 years of nonstop subversion, but it is exhausting. Iran is no longer so vulnerable, alhamdulillah .
What was meant to be the crowning achievement of imperial subterfuge in Venezuela was to use a similar computer breakdown of the electrical system of virtually the entire country. (Bad move to put all your electricity in one basket.)
In a Telesur interview (sorry, it’s banned under Canadian democracy), Professor Adriansa dealt with possible causes of the blackout at the Guri Dam Hydroelectric Project, which provides 70% of Venezuela’s electricity.
The dam was built in 1963 and expanded in 1976. Since 2000, there is an ongoing refurbishment project to extend the operation of Guri Power Plant by 30 years.
The Guri computer system which broke down was bought from ABB Canada, a subsidiary of ABB Switzerland and Sweden, in 2005, to interface with an existing centralized control system that was installed by SNC Lavalin. (yes, the SNC Lavalin)
Adriansa concluded the Guri computer system may already have had a backdoor built into it that would allow it to be hacked. Software or viruses could have been added gradually over a period of months. This would have required internal or ABB Canada complicity. As with the Stuxnet virus, software can be designed so that something would happen on a particular date.
The purpose — to paralyze Venezuela at the perfect moment, to create the psychological conditions the US has been seeking, where they wouldn’t have to bomb Venezuela. The Venezuelan people would give up their socialist project, the scenario goes, President Maduro would be driven from power, and the Venezuelan constitution would be repealed. Happy (imperial) ending.
Right on cue, as the hysterical demonstrations and containers of toothpaste and pasta were being burned on the Colombian border, with US troops on alert nearby, egged on by Quisling Juan Guaido, the entire electrical network of Venezuela was destroyed. For 12 days now, Venezuelans have been living on life support. So far, the people are not buying into the US plan to overthrow Maduro.
Can the Venezuelans hold firm through this latest colour revolution? Will they surrender to US diktat? I know if I were there, I would only be more committed to defeat the gringos and their lackeys.
CIA gift to Siberia
This cyber warfare really is old hat. It began as soon as computers became integral to industry back in the 1980s. The most spectacular example of this was the CIA plan to sabotage the economy of the Soviet Union, which resulted in “the most monumental non-nuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space”.
The CIA covertly transferred computer technology — again via a Canadian company — containing malfunctions, including software, that later triggered a huge explosion in a Siberian natural gas pipeline in mid-1982, former air force secretary Thomas Reed revealed in his memoirs At the Abyss: An Insider’s History of the Cold War (2004).
The US was trying to stop western Europe from importing Soviet natural gas. (Hey, isn’t that what the US is still trying to do, even after it destroyed the Soviet Union?) A KGB insider gained access to Russian purchase orders and the CIA slipped in the flawed software.
I hope the Bolivarians have backbone. They have to crack down on the traitors. It’s Cuba post-Bay-of-Pigs time. The white elite vs the brown socialists. Fighting the empire is not for the weak at heart. What doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger.

Suspected rhino poacher trampled by elephants and eaten by lions in South Africa.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/suspected-poacher-trample-elephants-eaten-lions-kruger-park.html,"Kirstjen Nielsen Wasn’t Cruel and Lawless Enough for Trump. That Doesn’t Exonerate Her. A suspected rhino poacher met a grisly demise at Kruger National Park in South Africa last week. He was part of a group of five suspected poachers who entered the park to allegedly kill rhinos but an elephant killed him and he was later “devoured” by a pride of lions, according to park officials. The family of the alleged poacher were told that their relative had been killed by an elephant and they requested the assistance of park officials to recover the remains. “During this search, which was boosted with a further compliment of Field Rangers, the remains of a body were discovered,” South African National Parks said in a news release published Friday . “Indications found at the scene suggested that a pride of lions had devoured the remains leaving only a human skull and a pair of pants. Skukuza police were notified immediately and are currently busy with further investigations into the incident.” The four other suspected poachers have been arrested. A police officer told local news website TimesLive that the men had gone poaching in the park on April 1, “when suddenly an elephant attacked” and killed one member of their party. Members of his party then said they carried his body to the road “so that passers-by could find it in the morning” before they left the park. They then informed the dead man’s family about what happened and the family called park officials. “Entering Kruger National Park illegally and on foot is not wise, it holds many dangers and this incident is evidence of that. It is very sad to see the daughters of the diseased mourning the loss of their father, and worse still, only being able to recover very little of his remains,” said Glenn Phillips, the park’s managing executive. Kruger National Park is a hotbed for poachers. Of the 680 arrests involving poaching and trafficking charges in 2016, 417 took place in and around Kruger, according to CNN . This is hardly the first time suspected poachers were killed by animals. Last July, as many as three suspected poachers in South Africa were killed by lions . Support our journalism

Here's what you need to know about Rule 6(e) and how it could force the Mueller report to become public - Palmer Report,www.palmerreport.com,Bill Palmer,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/rule-6e-forces-mueller-report-public/17224/,"Line
Now that even Robert Mueller’s own team is publicly asserting that William Barr is gratuitously misrepresenting what the Mueller report says about Donald Trump’s collusion and obstruction antics, House Democrats have gained a major edge in their legal battle to force the report to be made public. But this week an appeals court in an unrelated case prompted a number of doom-and-gloom headline writers to announce that the grand jury portions of the Mueller report will never become public. Not so fast.
The legal ramifications are complex, but it more or less comes down to this. Robert Mueller included significant information from his grand jury in his report, with the apparent intention of Congress and the public getting to see it, so they could understand the full extent of Donald Trump’s crime spree. William Barr is arguing that even if he’s forced to hand over the report, he’ll need to redact all of the grand jury information. So it was always going to come down to a judge’s decision about whether the Mueller grand jury materials should be released. In fact, as Palmer Report explained back on April 1st, the first step in that court battle is set to take place next week on April 12th, in front of Judge Federal Judge Beryl Howell.
In the meantime, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington DC just ruled on Friday that under Rule 6(e) in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a judge cannot arbitrarily release grand jury materials based on his or her own discretion – unless it qualifies for one of several exceptions. In other words, this isn’t doom-and-gloom at all for those who want to see the full Mueller report made public. It simply means that the judge must conclude that the Mueller grand jury materials do indeed meet one of those exceptions. So this is the part where we have to check what the legal experts have to say.
For instance, former U.S. Attorney Barb McQuade tweeted that, even in light of the new appeals court ruling, Judge Howell can order the release of the Mueller grand jury materials under Footnote 3 of Rule 6(e). What we find interesting is that this ruling clearly establishes that judges can release grand jury materials under the right circumstances. So if Judge Howell rules that the Mueller grand jury materials must be released, and William Barr tries to appeal it, House Democrats can point to Friday’s ruling to try to help make their case. "
By the numbers: Pennsylvania ranks the highest for state-imposed gas taxes,www.watchdog.org,Watchdog News,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.watchdog.org/pennsylvania/by-the-numbers-pennsylvania-ranks-the-highest-for-state-imposed/article_d8216eea-5710-11e9-9f5b-0fb8fb6a99c1.html,"Pennsylvania places the highest taxes and fees on gasoline in the country, according to the Washington-based Tax Foundation.
Drivers in the state pay 58.7 cents per gallon in state-imposed taxes and fees, the foundation reports. These levies may include excise taxes, fees related to environmental issues, storage tank levies and general sales taxes.
Only seven states apply sales taxes to gasoline, a practice that effectively layers levies onto one another. The seven states are California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and New York.
The gas taxes studied do not include an 18.4-cent-per-gallon federal excise levy on gasoline.
The foundation deems gas taxes a sensible way for states to fund road repairs, maintenance and highway expansion since those who use the public roads the most pay the most via gas taxes. But some states don’t index the taxes for inflation, meaning that revenues generated through the taxes can lag behind state infrastructure needs over time, according to the analysis.

The past few days, we’ve seen the return of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s famous “gevalt campaign” from 2015, named for the Yiddish expression of alarm, often paired with the interjection “oy!”Netanyahu spent the last week of the previous election campaign giving interview after interview and warning that the right-wing government was in danger if people didn’t vote for the Likud. Sound familiar? It’s exactly what he’s been saying the past few days, as well. The last election ended with 30 seats for the Likud, and the second-largest party, Zionist Union, trailing far behind with 24.But this time, the downsides of Netanyahu shouting “gevalt” are greater than they were four years ago, and familiarity with the tactic may make it less effective.Netanyahu has been in a low-grade “gevalt” mode since the beginning of the election season, warning that a vote for Blue and White would bring about a repeat of the Oslo Accords or the Second Intifada.As the end of the campaign approaches, Netanyahu has promised to annex parts of the West Bank – which, while a common position in the Likud, is not one that he’d expressed so unequivocally – and that there won’t be a Palestinian state on his watch, both of which are stances of parties to the Likud’s Right.And the panicked messaging from the Likud has been about the need for the party to be bigger than Blue and White, saying that President Reuven Rivlin plans to choose the leader of the largest party to form the next government if no one gets 61 recommendations to be prime minister.Ironically, Netanyahu tried to pass a law last year that would force Rivlin to appoint the head of the largest party as prime minister. Now that is his nightmare scenario, since Blue and White has a slight lead in most of the final polls, and Zehut leader Moshe Feiglin has not committed to either side, despite being on the far Right, which would mean neither bloc has a majority, even if the Right is larger.But the other right-wing parties – New Right, Yisrael Beytenu, Union of Right-Wing Parties, and to a lesser extent Kulanu – are wise to this tactic and immediately started pushing back against it. They have said there is no way they will sit in Gantz’s coalition, which means that a vote for them is still safely a vote for Netanyahu as prime minister. And they warned that Netanyahu’s sharp Right turn could just be empty campaign promises. Unlike last time, other parties refused to hold a joint right-wing rally – leading to a planned Sunday-night event to be canceled – and they also would not join “Moving Right,” a Likud initiative to increase voter turnout.And this brings us to the big risk Netanyahu is taking in his strategy to take votes from the satellite parties on the Right and bring them to Likud.In 2015, none of those parties were in danger of dropping below the threshold.This time, all of them have polled close to the threshold at some point, and Kulanu and Yisrael Beytenu have repeatedly fallen below it. Moving too many of the smaller parties’ votes to the Likud could push parties out of the Knesset entirely, and make it even more difficult for Netanyahu to form the right-wing coalition that he has been promising.Of course, this is only a risk for Netanyahu if he actually wants to form a right-wing government. Campaign promises are worth very little, and it’s entirely possible that if the Likud is the largest party, Netanyahu will ask Blue and White to join his government. Certainly Blue and White would be a more comfortable partner than URP or the New Right when considering US President Donald Trump’s expected peace plan, which would likely involve concessions of land and sovereignty.At the same time, Blue and White has a problem with sitting with a prime minister under indictment, an entirely plausible scenario in the next few months, considering that Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit recommended charging Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and bribery. Whereas the haredi parties and most of the Right have said they would remain in Netanyahu’s government. That once again raises the point that pushing the Likud’s natural coalition partners below the threshold may leave Netanyahu without options.In the end, the “gevalt” campaign may do Netanyahu and the Likud more harm than good when it comes to the end goal, forming the next government. But we’ll only know for sure on Wednesday morning, after all the votes are counted.

By THE MEDIA LINE, MOAMMAR AL-ERYANI April 7, 2019 21:43 b Protesters gather during a rally against the Middle East conference in Warsaw, in Sanaa, Yemen February 17, 2019 . (photo credit: REUTERS/MOHAMED AL-SAYAGHI)
SANA'A - The tolerance shown by some actors in the international community towards the Houthis militias in Yemen reflects a lack of deep understanding and awareness of the nature of the dilemma that the Yemenis suffer by this ideological militia. In the sense that, this is not just a bloody, sectarian and racial coup by Iranian-backed militia against the state and its institutions, rather, it is most serious, where the militia, besides the aggressive and cruel war against Yemenis, is waging another brutal war against all coexistence, equality and civil values in a systematic way, using state institutions and potentials that they seized by force and intimidation. Apparently, the international community is not aware of this serious war against Yemen humanitarian identity and against coexistence, equality, and civic values. Houthis manipulate educational institutions in creating a bloody ideological army, whose creed is centered around “death”, within a process of continuous provocative discourse at schools, universities, and mosques, as well as provocative discourse at local radio, TV stations and social media. Houthis doctrine is based on an ideology that praises death and uses it as their motto, as seen in the so-called chanting which was inspired by Iranian revolution principles; (God is Great, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse of the Jews, Victory to Islam); which become a mobilizing and psychological program that dictates all the discourses and literature of Houthis leaders and insurgents. Such chanting is being repeated at all of their events, and they wrote it all over walls, streets, and mountains under their control. This chanting, launched by the founder of Houthis, Hussein Al-Houthi, in a 2002 statement became the theoretical foundation of the public mobilization of the militia, and their insistence that this slogan be chanted at public and worship places was one of the reasons that led to the war in the summer of 2004. The slogan was inspired by Khomeini’s revolution in Iran.So, what do you expect from a group of people that raises death and hatred as their slogan? They chant death to America, Israel, and Jews, but in fact, they kill, oppress, loot, and terrorize Yemenis, claiming that they are agents of US and Israel !! Although such chanting has its psychological influence that turns Houthis into human bombs, yet it is just one in a series of violent and lethal methods Houthis use to train its followers inside their Hawza, and now are trying to impose it on all Yemenis, particularly at schools, where provocative, hate speech and extremism became part of the curriculum and extra-curricular activities, aiming to raise a whole generation equipped with hatred and a willingness to kill. Houthis turned schools into military camps and hatchery to produce insurgents, using starvation as a method in this sense. Students were sent to the war zones, and provided with high grades at schools in change, thereby linking school scores with the death and violence culture by forcing students to join the warfronts. This is evident by the high number of minors among Houthis combatants; a practice that defies all human values and international conventions that ban child recruitment. Furthermore, Houthis nominate a number of select students to attend secret training sessions for week and months, where they are exposed to brainwashing courses and military training. This explains the continuation of Houthis war since 2004. Houthis care less about the lives of their adversaries, or even the lives of their insurgents, turning the militia into a machine producing human death tools, rendering all peace opportunities futile. As part of its mobilization efforts, Houthis militia published Jihad, the children’s magazine that glorifies terror, incites to violence and hatred, and includes sectarian and extremist ideologies unknown to the Yemeni community.On the other hand, the international community, and the UN way of managing the Yemeni crisis, allow for more chances for the militias to tamper with Yemen’s present and future. Whereas, the international community strives for peace, which is the pursuit of the legitimate government; Iranian-backed militia are intensifying their sabotage and provocative activities at schools under their control and brainwash children to fake their identity, values and beliefs to turn them into saboteurs of Yemen, present and future. Throughout the past years, Houthis committed heinous crimes against Yemeni people, through their fanatic elements, trained in death and hatred at their stronghold governorate, Sa’da. Today, these elements, proliferated into thousands following the September 2014 coup, are spreading the death and hatred experience all over the densely populated governorates under their control, hence every year passes, allowing Houthis to produce tens of thousands of death bombs that threaten peace the world over, not in Yemen and the region only.According to Houthis literature, their war will not be limited to Yemen, rather it will be expanded to reach other countries and its interest in the region, with direct support and great resources provided by Iran. The world is still suffering and paying heavy price from terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda, and ISIS, with far fewer resources compared to the Iranian-backed Houthis, and there is great concern that one day the world will regret leaving such a sectarian and terrorist group whose brutality and risk is much more than Al-Qaeda’s and ISIS’s, grows. In fact, the repercussions of the Yemeni crisis must put the international community before its responsibilities, towards Iran’s incursion in Yemen through its Houthis arm, and danger bells must be sounded at such an exacerbating threat, noting that Iranian-backed Houthis militia, by a generation saturated with hatred, death, extremism, and terror culture, will not only undermine the present of Yemen but will sabotage its future. Unless the international community play its role in reinstating the legitimate government soon, then it shall wait for the catastrophic consequences, not only on Yemenis but on the whole region and the world. Where Houthis are striving to create new realities by destroying education process, by changing the curriculum and turning school benches into recruitment centers, and platforms to impose their extremist and odd ideas, change Yemenis’ identity and destroy the coexistence and social fabric of the Yemeni community. The international community needs to understand that leaving Yemeni children as easy prey for Houthis militia, will turn them into time bombs, threaten the security and interests of the region and the world, and failure to reinstate the legitimate government, and ousting the coup, will only mean a new wave of organized terrorism and sectarian and extremist ideology. Now Yemenis are paying the heavy price for leaving students of merely five schools in Marran, Sa’da governorate, exposed to such extremism ideology, so just imagine how is the situation now, following Houthis control over thousands of schools in Sana’a and other areas under their control. And what the world is expecting unless it understands the serious risks of delaying Houthis defeat and until it saves Yemenis generation and the world from such satanic plant and ideology. The war fought by Yemenis to preserve their identity against the ideological invasion from Tehran is equally important to the political and military fight against Houthis militia. Houthis militia is racing against time to brainwash Yemen youth, to attract more insurgents to the warfronts, due to their failure on recruiting other adults, and the ideological war need to receive further and exceptional attention, and to mobilize all potentials in this endeavor, including all Yemeni categories and elites, with the support of the Arab Coalition countries, to preserve Yemeni social fabric, national peace and identity. The international community is also expected to assume its responsibilities, to combat this bloody invasion which is exacerbating day by day, and it is about time now to stop the spoiling and tolerance policy, that will only lead to more damages and bloodshed. The international community needs to be more realistic in understanding the dilemma the Iranian-Houthis militia represents to Yemenis, and the region and shall understand that Yemeni people are suffering from oppression, injustice, silencing and intimidation by the militia at areas under their control. Furthermore, I believe that most of the inhabitants in Sana’a are held hostage to this barbaric militia. For more stories, visit themedialine.org .

Notable German journalist under fire for comparing Israel to its enemies - Middle East - Jerusalem Post,www.jpost.com,Benjamin Weinthal,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Notable-German-journalist-under-fire-for-comparing-Israel-to-its-enemies-586045,"Middle East Notable German journalist under fire for comparing Israel to its enemies Professor Steinberg added “ If Schapira is seriously interested in the treatment of minors worldwide, including by Israel, she should look at the facts, and not propaganda. And she should apologize."" Palestinian children hold toy guns during a protest in Jerusalem. (photo credit: REUTERS)
A prominent German journalist last month compared the Jewish state to its enemies in a Tweet, sparking sharp rebukes from Israeli experts on Sunday.Prof. Gerald Steinberg, the head of the Jerusalem-based NGO Monitor, told The Jerusalem Post: “Unfortunately Esther Schapira failed to fact check the propaganda claims in the Haaretz article. Haaretz echoes the false claims of an NGO linked to the PFLP terror network (Defense for Children International Palestine). And the ‘evidence’ from the local UNICEF branch (from 2013) is also based on the same DCIP demonization.” Steinberg, who is a political studies professor at Bar Ilan University, added “If Schapira is seriously interested in the treatment of minors worldwide, including by Israel, she should look at the facts, and not propaganda. And she should apologize.”Esther Schapira, a journalist with the German public television network, Hessischer Rundfunk, tweeted on March 16: “I love Israel and I hate when it is acting like its enemies. Heartbreaking and appalling. Israel jails hundreds of Palestinian boys a year. These are their testimonies.”Schapira, a German Jew born in Frankfurt, commented in her Tweet in reaction to a March 16 Haaretz article titled: ‘Endless Trip to Hell’: Israel Jails Hundreds of Palestinian Boys a Year. These Are Their Testimonies.She linked to the Haaretz article in her Tweet.Dr. Efraim Zuroff, the head of the Jerusalem office of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, told the Post: “Esther Schapira clearly fails to understand the realities in the Middle East. She accuses Israel of behaving like her enemies. So who exactly is she referring to?The Iranian mullahs dreaming of nuking Israel, the Hamas movement ruling Gaza that shoots rockets at Israeli civilian centers, or maybe that paragon of human rights, the Palestinian Authority which spends millions compensating the families of terrorists who murder Israeli civilians?”Arsen Ostrovsky, an Israeli international human rights lawyer, told the Post: “Comparing the necessary self-defensive actions of the Jewish state to Palestinian terrorists, including genocidal jihadist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, who are sworn to its destruction, is utterly appalling, vile and reprehensible. Such comparisons and attempted moral equivalence demonstrate either a gross naïveté about the very real security threats faced by the State of Israel, or willful distortion of reality, including the fact that many terror attacks are carried out by Palestinian minors.”Ostrovsky added, “At all times, the State of Israel acts in accordance with relevant international law, however the greater issue here is the institutionalized incitement by the Palestinian leadership that leads such minors to engage in acts of violence and terror in the first instance.”Schapira’s Tweet led to several days of heated debate on Twitter. Malca Goldstein-Wolf, a German Jewish activist, criticized Schapira on Twitter: “The word of a Jew who defames Israel weighs much heavier than that of a non-Jew,” adding that it gives a shot in the arm to antisemites.After the Post sent the Israeli criticisms to Schapira, she wrote: “‘Like’ is not meant as an equation. Of course, Israel is not like its enemies. Exactly to this difference, I refer yes. A comparison in a concrete point is not an equation and certainly not a general equation. When I received the misunderstood reactions on Twitter, I tried to explain myself. Unfortunately, in vain.”She added: “Perhaps I should have been more careful in evaluating the Haaretz article. However, so far I have not read any concrete proof that the cases described there are not correct. In retrospect, I think I should have reworded the tweet to avoid misunderstandings. I regret that I underestimated the emotional impact of the Twitter medium, the shortening involved, and the 260 characters.”She wrote, “It would have been better if I had written ‘The cases described here must urgently be examined. If they are true, then it would be unworthy of a constitutional state like Israel. Otherwise I only know such behavior from Israel’s enemies, such as Hamas or Iran. There children are ruthlessly used for political purposes and abused. In addition, if Palestinian children were truly mistreated in the manner described in the Haaretz article, then they will make them very receptive to Hamas’s hate education.”’She noted, “And it probably also plays a role that I wrote in English and not in my mother tongue, German.”Schapira said, “I also have no doubt that the issue of the treatment of Palestinian children is a particularly popular topic for Palestinian propaganda, and that particular caution is needed when dealing with sources.”

Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images President Trump tried to secure votes for his 2020 re-election bid at the Republican Jewish Coalition Annual Leadership Meeting on Saturday, speaking to a largely supportive crowd that frequently chanted ""4 more years"" and displayed a united departure from the splintered view the group had of Trump in 2017 . The big picture: RJC board members, who are confident that 2020 is the cycle where Republicans can finally make real inroads with the Jewish vote, have planned a $10 million investment to garner Jewish support for Trump, Politico reports .

We’ve seen different iterations of this in previous elections either in midterm or presidential elections, and each time it’s kind of repackaged with a different narrative in an attempt by Republicans to chip away at the Jewish vote — and every time it fails."" — Halie Soifer, executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, in an interview with Politico What we're watching: As Trump tries to build a stronger Jewish voting base, Republicans are using Israel to make political points. House GOP lawmakers attempted to halt a recently passed resolution to end U.S. military involvement in Yemen via an amendment that would have added language to oppose the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which promotes various forms of activism against Israel. ""They wanted to kill Israel. They wanted to destroy Israel,"" Trump said Saturday on the Iran Nuclear Deal, which the U.S. abandoned last year but is still adhered to by Iran .

They want you to downgrade yourself for their benefit.
But they're not returning the favour and discriminating against themselves for your sake.
And while this is going on they're also saying don't discriminate against anybody; they're saying all hate should be condemed but they need you to hate yourself to succeed in their plans to have more than you.
They both discriminate against the poor while saying they are helping the poor. If you help others you become poor; if you become poor they discriminate against you.
They hate people who help others because it exposes their lies so they punish it . Their business can't exist without discrimination. For their lifestyle to exist they must systematically discrminate against the poor .
Solution
Create a system which doesn't discrminate against the poor; it's the complete opposite of their system which discrminates against the poor.
The top 1% become the bottom 1% and because the system doesn't discrminate against the poor they can work their way up just like everybody else instead of cheating to win."
US Forces Evacuate Tripoli As Fighting In Libyan Capital Heats Up | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-07/us-forces-evacuate-tripoli-fighting-libyan-capital-heats,"— SMM Libya (@smmlibya) April 7, 2019
Haftar - who solidified control of Eastern Syria and swept through the south in January, seeks to capture Tripoli and seize military control of the entire country, after his self-proclaimed Libyan National Army (LNA) claimed to have secured Tripoli's international airport. As we noted earlier Sunday , some international reports confirmed that the LNA gained full control of the airport later in the day Saturday, but other conflicting reports say that this was premature , which could mean only a section was wrested from Tripoli forces.

The LNA's move on the capital comes before next week's UN-sponsored talks designed to map out a path to fresh elections, according to The Guardian .

The UN, meanwhile, appealed for a two-hour truce so that casualties and civilians could be evacuated , according to the BBC. The plea went unmet as fighting continued.

According to Bloomberg , UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on March 31 that the two sides have discussed a ""united caretaker government,"" however it's clear that those mediation efforts are faltering.
Resistance to Haftar runs deep in Tripoli. Most of Libya’s population is based around the capital. Haftar’s ragtag forces are better organized than rivals and easily took over the south, including the biggest oilfield Sharara , through negotiations rather than fighting. Haftar’s move west, however, triggered a sharp reaction by the Tripoli militias. “At the moment it’s too early to come to any firm conclusion, and ultimately fighting could drag for weeks,” said Mohammad Darwazah, a director at Medley Global Advisors. - Bloomberg
As for how the current situation will impact oil prices, Bloomberg notes that the impact won't be immediate - as ""Major oilfields and export terminals are far from the clashes,"" however ""history shows that fighting anywhere in Libya can cause dramatic swings in output.""
In June, Libya’s crude shipments were suspended for weeks after Haftar captured two export terminals and transferred them to an oil authority in eastern Libya. Exports dropped by 800,000 barrels a day and Libya lost almost $1 billion before he handed the terminals back to the Tripoli-based National Oil Corp. “Oil operations have been largely normal but any sustained fighting could quickly bring Libya back below one million barrels a day,” Darwazah said. - Bloomberg
Bloomberg further notes that any disruption at Zawiya port - the Sahara's main export terminal, would cause a partial or a complete shutdown of the oil field which currently produces around 300,000 barrels a day. It is expected to load 6 million barrels of crude in April, which could be completely under Haftar's control if he takes the terminal.
Hafter now controls over one million barrels of oil production a day , as well as Libya's strongest military force which is backed by Russia.
We're guessing the latest Libyan internal conflict will create a new wave of migrants that will promptly head for Europe. Tags "
Watch: Kim Foxx Remains Silent As Supporter Calls Chicago Police ‘Blue Klux Klan’ - Tea Party News,www.teaparty.org,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.teaparty.org/watch-kim-foxx-remains-silent-supporter-calls-chicago-police-blue-klux-klan-355486/,"Politics
(Breitbart) – A supporter of Cook County Attorney Kim Foxx, whose office recently dropped all charges against Empire actor Jussie Smollett, referred to the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police as the “Blue Klux Klan” in a Saturday afternoon press conference — a racial slur the top prosecutor would not refute when asked whether she concurred with the comparison.
Fox News correspondent Matt Finn reported the eye-opening comment was made by Black Lives Matter activist Jamal Greene ahead of Foxx’s remarks on the Smollett case at Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr.’s Rainbow PUSH Coalition office in Chicago. As Kim Foxx made her way out of the press conference, Finn pressed the attorney repeatedly about whether she endorsed Greene’s remarks.
“Ms. Foxx, do you think the FOP is the blue klux klan? Do you think that every police officer is racist in this city?” You’re going to let somebody say that?” the reporter asked Foxx, who did not once acknowledge the question. A rally in support of Kim Foxx just happened in which at least one speaker flat out called the FOP racist “blue klux klan.” Foxx did not object to that and carried on with her speech. After her extemely short presser I asked if she agrees that all police are racist: pic.twitter.com/kqM4G8hAze
— Matt Finn (@MattFinnFNC) April 6, 2019
In her remarks before supporters and the media, Foxx openly wondered if her race had something to do with the harsh criticism she has faced since her office announced that charges against Smollett had been dropped. The actor is accused by the Chicago Police Department of staging what he claimed to be a racist and homophobic attack in January. The Empire actor told officers two masked men assaulted him, doused him with an unknown chemical substance, and shouted “This is MAGA country! before fleeing.
“I have been asking myself for the last two weeks what is this really about,” Kim Foxx said. “As someone who has lived in this city, who came up in the projects of this city to serve as the first African American woman in this role, it is disheartening to me … that when we get in these positions somehow the goalposts change.”
Foxx, who claimed to have recused herself from the case after she communicating with a Smollett relative during the probe, reiterated that she welcomes of an independent investigation into the way she and her office handled the case. She also said that under the law, Smollett could be fined a maximum of $10,000 and that the actor did pay that amount because his $10,000 bond was forfeited.
However, Foxx did not address specifics of the case, or the criticism leveled by legal experts and others who said it was highly unusual not to require an admission of guilt by Smollett, particularly since at the time they dropped charges, prosecutors said they believed they could have proven the charges against the actor.
“In my 48 years of practice, I certainly have never seen a deferred prosecution done like that,” Richard Kling, an IIT-Kent Law School professor told the Chicago Sun-Times last week.
Foxx also responded to the calls by various critics to resign, saying that she will complete her term that ends next year and has plans to run for re-election.
Chicago law officials plan on filing a civil lawsuit against Smollett to recoup the roughly $130,000 the city spent on alleged hate hoax investigation.

A reported decision by the US to designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a “terrorist organization” could significantly damage the Islamic Republic’s already failing economy, analysts believe.President Donald Trump’s administration is set to announce the move in the coming days, according a report in the Wall Street Journal. If it comes to pass, it would mark the first time Washington officially labeled another country’s military a “terrorist” entity. Dr. Raz Zimmt, an expert on Iran at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, told The Media Line that such a decision had “the potential to cause a lot of damage,” but he was unsure it would ultimately be an effective strategy.“It will be very difficult, if not impossible, to really trace all individuals and companies involved in economic activities linked to the IRGC,” Zimmt explained.As an example, he cited an oil worker employed by a company with links to the IRGC.“Is [this worker] considered to be someone who would be under sanctions? I don’t know exactly what the US administration is prepared to do,” he noted.The IRGC was established by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini following the 1979 Islamic Revolution in a bid to consolidate several paramilitary forces and protect the country’s Islamic system of law. Its reach has evolved such that it now also controls a significant portion of the country’s economy, including its nuclear program and key sectors of the oil, gas and telecommunications industries, as well as major infrastructure projects.Some estimate that the IRGC controls anywhere from 10 percent to 33% of the entire Iranian economy via subsidiaries and trusts.“Saying that as a whole the IRGC is a terror organization means that actually millions of Iranians are members of a terror organization,” Zimmt elaborated, adding that men in the Islamic Republic between the ages of 18 and 20 must serve in the military, and many are therefore recruited into the IRGC.“The bottom line is that, yes, the IRGC controls quite a significant segment of the Iranian economy, but it will take many efforts to see which individuals and companies are indeed related to the organization,” he stressed.Adding complexity to the issue, according to Zimmt, is the fact that the IRGC’s main activities in the missile and nuclear programs are already under sanction. The same goes for the Quds Force, an elite armed wing of the IRGC, which carries out activities in other countries across the Middle East and farther afield.The Trump Administration’s upcoming move would mark an escalation in the White House’s increasingly harsh strategy toward Tehran, and comes amid recent reports that the US is preparing to impose additional economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic in the coming months. Dr. Eldad Pardo, an Iranian affairs expert at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told The Media Line the move would also heighten the impact of economic sanctions already in place since Trump reimposed them last year. “It’s one thing to breach American sanctions, but it’s another to support a terrorist organization, so it will add to the fears that some businesspeople feel when dealing with Iran,” Pardo stated.“Basically, if you want to deal with Iran, you have to deal with the Revolutionary Guards because they are involved in everything,” he said.“It’s not a smart business decision to invest in a country that is in direct confrontation with the United States,” he added. “The great majority of the Iranian people want to stick with the nuclear deal; they want to open the economy; they want a transformation of the regime. This will add to that pressure.”Pardo concluded by saying: “Of course, the policy will be judged by its implementation. The goal is not to destroy Iran, but to force it to change its policies.” For more stories, visit themedialine.org .

GAZA - Five lions, five monkeys, four ostriches, three peacocks, two wolves and a hyena departed Gaza for Jordan on Sunday, after being rescued from a Gaza zoo where many animals died of starvation and lack of care .The animal welfare group Four Paws international carried out the relocation, which also included dogs, cats, foxes, porcupines and 10 squirrels. Fathy Jomaa, owner of the zoo in Rafah, southern Gaza, blamed bad economic conditions and a decade of Israeli-led blockade on the narrow coastal enclave for leaving him unable to properly feed and care for his animals.Jomaa had come under intense criticism by animal care groups after a series of recent deaths and mishaps. Four lion cubs died from cold during a storm in January. A monkey killed another, and a porcupine died more recently of unknown causes, said the owner. Earlier this year he de-clawed two young lions so that zoo visitors could safely pose for selfies with them.Now only the birds remain at the site. They were left behind by Four Paws.Four Paws veterinarian Amir Khalil, who led the rescue mission, said cages at the Gaza zoo had become too small to house the animals and their offspring. He said the animals would go to a sanctuary in Jordan.""It is a tough decision, I feel like I am losing my family. I lived with some of those animals for 20 years,"" Jomaa told Reuters, saying that economic hardship left him with no choice. ""I hope they find a better place to live,"" he said.The head of the Land Crossings Authority at Israel's Ministry of Defense, Shlomo Saban, said in a statement they ""used every means at our disposal to help transfer the animals as quickly as possible.""Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza for security reasons after the Islamist group Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. The World Bank says the blockade has reduced the territory, home to 2 million Palestinians, to a state of economic collapse.

(photo credit: REUTERS) UPGRADE YOUR JPOST EXPERIENCE FOR 5$ PER MONTH Show me later
On the eve of the elections in Israel, the PLO launched a scathing attack on mainstream candidates and said the campaign has been infested with racism and incitement.The PLO’s Negotiations Affairs Department said that none of these candidates have called for a comprehensive settlement plan with the Palestinians. The PLO also warned that Israeli officials were “seeking to distort the facts by exploiting international coverage of the election.”Israel, the group said, was seeking to use the Old City of Jerusalem as a “facade or background” for interviews with Israeli guests to “suggest that the Old City is part of Israel.”In a statement titled “Israel’s 20th Knesset – The Reality in Occupied Palestine VS. International Actions,” the PLO accused the main candidates running in the election of “campaigning on the preservation and expansion of Israeli settlements, a commitment to further annexation of Palestinian land, reaffirmation of Jerusalem as the exclusive capital of Israel, the dehumanization of Palestinians and the denial of their rights.”They claimed that the candidates, “whether from the current government or the opposition, rely upon the perpetuation of the culture of impunity allowing Israel to act without consequence.”Israel, the group further charged, continues to receive growing international support “despite the fact that it has systematically violated international law and United Nations resolutions, rather than being threatened or served with sanctions.”The PLO claimed that Israel has never recognized, let alone implemented, any resolution by the UN.It took to task the international community for its failure to take measures against Israel for its “systematic violations and crimes.” On the other hand, the PLO praised the parliaments of Ireland and Chile for voting to ban products from Israeli settlements.In a separate report, their Department of Public Diplomacy & Policy pointed out that aside from Meretz, Labor and Arab Israeli parties, “all other competing lists oppose Palestinian rights, reject the two-state solution, and have vowed to ensure that the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and freedom are quashed.”The report accused Israeli candidates and party lists of engaging in a “fierce competition on who can be more aggressive against the Palestinian people, which party can exact more violence, and which party list of coalition is more capable of preventing the realization of Palestinian rights.”This Israeli election season, the PLO report charged, “has been infested with racism, Islamophobia, incitement to violence, open calls for murder, and other gravely worrying signs of anti-Palestinian hatred. It demonstrates that the only issue Israeli parties agree on is how to deny the Palestinian people their rights.”

Donald Trump Has Shot Himself In the Foot on Immigration – Mother Jones,www.motherjones.com,Political Blogger,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2019/04/donald-trump-has-shot-himself-in-the-foot-on-immigration/,"The Washington Post reports that President Trump plans to double the number of guest workers allowed into the country:
DHS and the Labor Department plan to grant an additional 30,000 H-2B visas this summer on top of the 33,000 H-2B visas they had planned to give out, the agencies confirmed.
Trump says there is a national emergency at the southern border because too many people are trying to come to the United States. On Friday, he implored migrants to turn around and go home. “We can’t take you anymore,” Trump said Friday while standing at the border in California. “Our country is full.”
But his administration is giving a different message to some short-term workers. With the additional visas, the Trump administration is on track to grant 96,000 H-2B visas this fiscal year, the most since 2007, when George W. Bush was president.
Translation: we need more workers to harvest the crops.
It’s a funny thing. Given who he is and the trust that his base puts in him, Trump could have negotiated a historic compromise on immigration. Back in late 2017, he was riding high enough that he could have gotten significant concessions from Democrats. It would have truly given him something to brag about.
The Ann Coulters of the world would have screamed, and the Freedom Caucus would have voted against it, but so what? He would have told his base that it was the toughest—but fairest!—immigration bill ever passed, and they would have believed him. Hell, they would have cheered him. And it would have been genuinely bipartisan.
Instead he listened to Stephen Miller and got nothing. His base is still loyal, but they would have stuck with him anyway. He’s gotten nothing out of this. What a moron. Looking for news you can trust?

Said Trump: “They read a little page given by lawyers that are all over the place — you know lawyers, they tell them what to say. I am very fearful for my life, I am very worried that I will be accosted if I’m sent back home.”
He added: “No, no, he’ll do the accosting.” Barr’s Spin Job About Political Wire

Coaching staff is learning to adjust with the new dynamic of increased rate of turnover. Instead of players staying for 3-4 years, it’s now trending towards 2-3 years, with a few one year wonders in the mix. Window is wide open. Few is recruiting better than at any point in his career.

Absurd comparison w/Butler....why not throw in Saint Joe, VCU, Geo Mason, Sister Loyola and other NCAA one hit wonders? +1 Posts 77 I think this thread is more clickbaitish than the original article. Blanchette notes that Butler lost potentially the best coach in college basketball to the NBA. Few is still here. He may be right in that we may be at the height or just on the downhill of a high tide, but every program has relative peaks and valleys. Graduate transfers and Euros are what really enabled this current run to happen. We still are a top Euro place, if not more and we will see what happens with grad transfers. The level of talent seriously escalated with the Karnowski commitment. Posts 6,760 Blanchette never suggested the window was closing....it fact....the whole point of the article was that ….it ended for Butler when Stevens left …..and Few is still here...…. so the Program has advanced in the last few years and is likely to continue improving... I have no idea if they will ever win a National Championship....it is a crap shoot and you can crap out at anytime even when your number is 6 or 8 and it doesn't matter to me if they do or don't...the fact is that they are contenders...and have a chance nearly every year... they are relevant...just ask Jimmy Kimmel ... Posts 11,690 John having a bad day. And reflected in his article. We’re in the relentless pursuit of a title. Overall the players are better than ever but we seem to be 1 or two players short of a title that can be obtain d with a smidge more luck. Fluke article from John.

The seeds of hope have been planted,guboards.spokesmanreview.com,Reborn,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://guboards.spokesmanreview.com/showthread.php?65597-The-seeds-of-hope-have-been-planted,"11,330 The seeds of hope have been planted While watching Texas Tech beat Michigan St I had a really good thought,""The Zags were really good this year, better than Michigan St."" And this thought felt real good inside, and it's led me to put an end to this season. The season wasn't a failure at all, which I think some who post here believe (They are entitled to their opinions). If Texas Tech wins it all the Zags could end up the #2 team in the country, and at worst the #5. Which is really a GREAT season. My mind is filled with so many great memories of this season, and I've written about them all. There are two All-Americans on this team, which I believe is a first. And both Rui and Brandon have left their mark on Zag history and will always be remembered for what they achieved. I want to take a moment to say thank you, to everyone on this team. Thank you, 2019 Zags. Thanks for a year of great memories that I will not forget. Thanks for another really successful season. And there is so much to look forward to in 2020. I've already begun doing extensive research. We have one of the top recruiting classes in the country. I think it's 3rd best. And we have a lot of returning players that will be great leaders next year. Put these two elements together, and let Mark Few and his staff do what they do every year, and we're going to have another top ten team. The seeds of hope have already been planted in my brain. I think Tillie should return to play, and be the leader that he is meant to be. He could have an unbelievable year, especially if he begins to prepare for it now and works to get into very top shape. Norvell and Kispert will be better, and have more freedom than ever before. I think Kispert needs to lose ten pounds so he can be quicker and be able to defend better. I think it will also help his shooting. Norvell needs to really work on his mid-range moves and shots and become more of a scorer than a 3 point shooter. I know he can do this if he decides to put in the work. I look forward to seeing him be more of a leader next year and become a go-to guy. And we have Petrusev back with these guys and he's going to be very, very good. He was already really good this year, and with added weight and muscle he'll be so much better next year. And I can't write off Ayayi or Foster. Not just yet. Let's see how they develop by the Fall. Having six guys back who were a big part of one of the best teams in the history of Gonzaga basketball is a great place to start. And then you add Watson, Ravet, Timme, Ballo, Zhakarov, Arlauskas and two others and you can begin to see what I mean, and why I""m excited. Watson and Ravet are from Washington which means a lot to me. I will really pull for these two players to have great seasons next year. We will have 7 or 8 new players next year depending on what Tillie and Foster do. That's exciting. And that's what I love about college ball. It's like a river always changing, always moving downstream, flowing in perfect harmony. Go Zags!!!"

Polish Boxer Retires After Crazy Fight That Had 10 Knockdowns | Fightful Boxing,www.fightful.com,Carlos Toro,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.fightful.com/boxing/results/polish-boxer-retires-after-crazy-fight-had-10-knockdowns,"3:35PM EDT Share this Article through Social Media:
Poland may not be host to many recognizable world-class boxers, but when it’s all said and done, it may end up being host to boxing’s most insane fight of 2019.
A wildly entertaining and roller coaster fight between Robert Talarek and Patryk Szymanski featured not one, not two, not three, not four, but 10 knockdowns. Perhaps just as crazy is the fact that the fight ended before the fifth round's conclusion as Talarek managed to stop Szymanski. Related Article Eddie Hearn: Fliip Hrgovic, Michael Hunter To Fight On Usyk-Takam Undercard
If you weren't able to find a way to watch a boxing fight from Poland, here's a quick summary of every knockdown in the fight:
Knockdown 1: Talarek moves forward, but Szymanski landed a quick, counter right jab to drop Talarek just 30 seconds in the first round.
Knockdown 2: Szymanski connects with another right hand upstairs, knocking Talarek down less than a minute after the first knockdown.
Knockdown 3: Talarek was able to recover from the first round and able to land a right hand that stunned Szymanski and quickly went down afterwards.
Knockdown 4: Less than a minute remaining in the second round, Szymanski lands a devastating overhand right to knock Talarek down a third time in the fight.
Knockdown 5: With just 20 seconds remaining in the second round, Szymanski lands three consecutive right hands that has Talarek tumbling down headfirst through the second rope.
Knockdown 6: Most of the third round is uneventful, but Talarek turned his fortunes around with a body shot that sent Szymanski to the canvas.
Knockdown 7: Still hurting from the body shots, Szymanski goes down again during an exchange.
Knockdown 8: Nearly halfway through the fourth round, Talarek works the body and lands a pair of left hands to Szymanski's ribs to drop him a fourth time in the bout.
Knockdown 9: Continuing his success working the body, Talarek lands a pair of right hand shots to the ribs that sent Szymanski to the canvas.
Knockdown 10: The fifth round was a constant back-and-forth battle with both men hurting each other with crazy shots. It was Talarek who delivered the final blow, a right hand to the side of Szymanski's head. Szymanski dropped to one knee and was slow to get up. Szymanski eventually got back up before the 10 count, but the referee waived off the crazy bout by the time he counted to nine.
With so many knockdowns, the scores were astonishingly low, with Talarek winning 35-34 on two of the three scorecards and the third judge scoring the fight a 34-34 draw. After the fight, Szymanski decided to call it a career after 20 pro bouts and a 19-1 record. Szymanski once held the WBC Youth World and Republic of Poland junior middleweight titles. -- Highlights from last night's spectacular, back-and-forth WAR between Patryk Szymanski and Robert Talarek in Poland.
