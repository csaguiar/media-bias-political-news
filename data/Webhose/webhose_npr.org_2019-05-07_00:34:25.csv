Rescue workers on the outskirts of Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, are rushing to find survivors a day after heavy rains caused a mountainside to partially collapse Monday morning, engulfing homes and killing hundreds.
The morgue in Freetown has stated that nearly 400 bodies have been brought there, according to Reuters and a representative from the Red Cross. The death toll in the West African nation is likely to rise — the Red Cross says hundreds more people remain unaccounted for.

""I have never seen anything like it. ... A river of mud came out of nowhere and swallowed entire communities, just wiped them away,"" Abdul Nasir, program coordinator of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said in a statement. ""We are racing against time, more flooding and the risk of disease to help these affected communities survive and cope with their loss.""
Photos from the scene show rescue workers using heavy equipment and even their hands to dig through the mud, searching for survivors. The communities most severely affected are Racecourse, Regent and Lumley on the eastern outskirts of Freetown. According to the Red Cross, in these areas, ""thousands of makeshift settlements are home to the city's poorest communities.""

The Red Cross says up to 3,000 people may have lost their homes. An estimated 25 homes were submerged in mud, and more than 100 were affected, the Red Cross told NPR .
Freetown's morgue was having trouble coping with all the bodies, as their loved ones wait outside to identify them. A BBC reporter at the scene said:
""I'm standing outside the central morgue of Freetown at the Connaught hospital. I've just been inside there, it's full to the brim. The authorities have had to bring out the corpses, lying just behind the perimeter fence there. I simply just could not count the number of bodies, some of them limbless, lying out there. The authorities say they are completely stretched to the limits, and they need all the help they can get.""

The BBC journalist said a doctor at the morgue told him that ""this compares to nothing he's seen before, and he's been doing this for decades — he says it doesn't compare to the country's civil war days, it doesn't compare to the outbreak of Ebola virus here, and it doesn't compare to any previous flood events here. He says they simply just can't cope."" A mass burial is expected once bodies have been identified, the BBC reports.
President Ernest Bai Koroma visited the scene on Tuesday and, as NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports, gave a televised address calling for calm.
""Fellow Sierra Leoneans, this tragedy of great magnitude has once again challenged us to stand by one another,"" Koroma said. ""Let me assure you that my government is fully engaged on this situation.""
A woman named Adama told the BBC that she was separated from her husband and baby during the mudslide.

Qatar beat Saudi Arabia on the field Thursday, in a resounding victory overshadowed by the significance of the meeting itself.
Surging off momentum built in the early rounds of the AFC Asian Cup , Qatar defeated the Saudis 2-0 . Almoez Ali, a 22-year-old forward, scored both goals for Qatar, holding his spot as top scorer in the tournament after a four-goal run against North Korea last weekend.
While Ali's heroics captivated onlookers at Zayed Sports City Stadium in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, geopolitics dominated the discourse around the game. It was the countries' first match-up since Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic relations with Qatar more than 18 months ago. Just weeks ago, Qatar officially pulled out of OPEC. 22-year-old Qatar striker Almoez Ali has scored seven goals in three games at this year's AFC Asian Cup.It's the first time a player has reached that total in a single tournament since Ali Daei's record of eight goals in 1996. — Scouted Football (@ScoutedFtbl) January 17, 2019
The tiny, oil- and gas-producing nation had announced last month that it would leave the cartel, digging its heels deeper into a dispute with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. Saudi Arabia broke off ties with Qatar in June 2017, alleging that it funds terrorist organizations, and the Saudis have maintained a boycott since then. Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates joined the boycott, which has unfolded against a backdrop of longstanding tensions between Qatar and surrounding states.

In addition to its role as a key player in the blockade, the U.A.E. is also playing host to the Asian Cup, which has caused inconveniences for Qatari nationals travelling to the games, including officials, journalists and just a trickle of fans, The New York Times reports . On social media, some people called the Qatar-Saudi Arabia match-up the ""Blockade Derby.""

But representatives from both countries said before the match that the two sides would separate politics and soccer. ""Football is a message of peace,"" Qatar spokesperson Ali Hassan al-Salat told The Guardian . Qatar's Crisis With Saudi Arabia And Gulf Neighbors Has Decades-Long Roots
Other countries locked in well-established political tensions have met in the tournament. Last week, Iran faced off against Iraq in a stadium in Dubai, in a match that ended with an anticlimactic 0-0 draw .
Qatar and Saudi Arabia will both advance to the final 16 teams. Qatar, which has maintained a perfect score in the tournament, is set to play Iraq on Tuesday."

That was one piece of advice passed along at the just-concluded Democratic National Convention. The words were spoken by New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who said he was quoting ""an African saying.""

— Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) July 26, 2016 The proverb got a lot of retweets. And some criticism. One Twitter user, Christiana A. Mbakwe, said, ""If someone starts an aphorism with 'there's an African saying' it's probably a mythical Quote: : misattributed to a whole continent.""
That wasn't the only purportedly African proverb uttered at the DNC. Hillary Clinton referred to her 1996 book It Takes a Village , whose title is said to be part of another saying from Africa: ""It takes a village to raise a child.""

— (((sfpelosi))) (@sfpelosi) July 29, 2016 Here at Goats and Soda, African countries are part of our beat. So we wondered: Are these both examples of proverbs from African countries?
What we found is that it takes a lot of phone calls to track down the origins of a proverb. And in the end, the answer might be: We just don't know.
Let's start with Booker's ""go fast"" Quote: : .
Imani Owens, assistant professor of African-American literature and culture at the University of Pittsburgh, is familiar with that proverb.
""There have been a lot of inspirational posters and T-shirts made,"" she says. As to its birthplace: ""I haven't been able to find, ever, the origins of the proverb.""
But Johnnetta Cole , director of the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art, believes this proverb originated on the African continent.
""In the circles that I move in, I'm not the only one quoting that proverb,"" says Cole.
She can't trace it to a specific place, though. Since Africa is a big continent, she says, ""It is always best when you can say: This is a proverb from Kenya. Even better if you could say, the Maasai people of Kenya, or if you can say, this is an Igbo proverb from Nigeria.""
Even though she thinks the ""go fast"" proverb springs from African culture, she says, ""I could not tell you which particular people the proverb is associated with.""
Regardless of its origins, the proverb does hold true to the spirit of some African cultures, say academics.
""The Africanist perspective is more about community, it's more about collaboration. It's less about what we can do individually,"" says Neal Lester , a humanities professor at Arizona State University who specializes in African-American literary studies. ""The essence of the proverb speaks to a certain worldview that challenges Western individualism,"" he said.
And then there's the ""village"" proverb.
When Hillary Clinton first used this proverb as the title of her book, academics puzzled over its origin. Comments in a discussion thread among scholars ranged from ""It is a common phrase"" to ""All I know is that it is an ancient African proverb that is being used to the point of cliché.""
One commenter was certain the proverb had African roots: ""In Kijita (Wajita) there is a proverb which says ""Omwana ni wa bhone,"" meaning regardless of a child's biological parent(s) its upbringing belongs to the community. In Kiswahili [another term for Swahili] the proverb ""Asiyefunzwa na mamae hufunzwa na ulimwengu"" approximates to the same.""
Others cited the saying as Native American. Or perhaps ""some sort of pseudo-African mix of Hallmark and folk sentiments.""
Lawrence Mbogoni , an African studies Quote: : : ""Proverb or not, 'It takes a whole village to raise a child' reflects a social reality some of us who grew up in rural areas of Africa can easily relate to. As a child, my conduct was a concern of everybody, not just my parents, especially if it involved misconduct. Any adult had the right to rebuke and discipline me and would make my mischief known to my parents who in turn would also mete their own 'punishment.' The concern of course was the moral well-being of the community.""
Another respondent added: ""I find it a reasonable and profound statement about collective social responsibility but perhaps not traceable to a specific origin.""
Meanwhile, if politicians (or voters) are looking for authentic proverbs from Africa to consider this election season, they might turn to Memory and Justice in Post-Genocide Rwanda, a forthcoming book by Timothy Longman , director of the African Studies Center at Boston University.
In his research with Rwandans, he heard people use this proverb to talk about how new political leaders aren't that different from the previous ones: ""In Rwanda we say, the dancers have changed, but the drums are the same.""

"Book Review: 'The Luminous Dead,' By Caitlin Starling : NPR",www.npr.org,Jason Sheehan,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/709991723/monsters-imaginary-and-real-haunt-the-caves-of-the-luminous-dead,"'Where The Nightmares Go' Maps The Territory Of Fear
It's tough to know here how much more I should tell you, because the entire architecture of the story hangs on the slow-burn paranoia and the fraying personal connection between Gyre and Em. I can say that the job isn't what Gyre expects it to be. And I can say that she was ridiculously, admittedly naïve to begin with — not really asking any questions, not even requesting a briefing before the book drops her into the initial descent — because she was so worried about her lie being found out. And I can certainly say that even with just two characters tangled up at the core of this book, Gyre isn't the only liar here. Em has secrets, too. She's her own special kind of monster — manipulative, damaged, terrible, but also deeply, deeply human. They both are. The Luminous Dead is too meticulously twisted to let anyone simply be evil without cause, without depth.
And that, actually, is the best thing about these kind of one-man (or, in this case, two-woman) shows. Like Ripley in Alien , like Mark Watney in The Martian , it's the lack of distractions — like multiple viewpoints, a large cast, a pushy narrator — that allows you to slip completely into one skin and wear it around for a while. It allows you to inhabit Gyre's world completely, without interruption and without ... relief.
Because the world we're offered isn't nice. Or comfortable. Or pleasant in almost any way. It's the kind of story that can make a single breath of cool air seem like a banquet and a massage; a sip of recycled urine the most luxurious thing imaginable. It is a claustrophobic story (because cave), a dark and blank and drippy one (because cave). Worse, it is a story about madness and loneliness and claustrophobia and isolation made even colder by the smart, awful, perfect application of technology.
See, Gyre spends her entire time locked in a special protective suit and helmet. Her meals are all nutritive paste delivered through a shunt directly into her stomach. Her air is filtered and recycled. She can't touch her face or scrub her fingers through her hair. She can't feel anything but aching muscles and exhaustion, but her suit can deliver drugs directly into her bloodstream to help. It can be operated remotely by Em if necessary. And everything Gyre sees is filtered through her heads-up display, overlaid with radar and sonar and image amplification, all of which is controlled by Em.
It is a torturous book. Horrifying in small, cutting, personal ways, and in the more classic scare-in-a-dark-room way. But there's an iron rod of panicked strength that runs through the middle of it.
Em, who may not have Gyre's best interests at heart. Who may not want her to see certain things. Who has profited by the poverty and desperation of this planet's population as the mines fail and jobs become more and more scarce. Who has sent other cavers down this hole before, not all of whom came back.
Em, who is crazy. A monster. A liar.
But also the only thing keeping Gyre alive.
So yes, The Luminous Dead is a book about spelunking and ghosts and the ways we are haunted by the dead and the missing. There are sequences about diving through flooded, silt-blind sumps that will raise every hair on your neck, and a long stretch (arguably too long) in the middle where even the mercy of having two characters for company becomes winnowed down to just one as Gyre, in a fit, cuts her communications with the surface.
It is a torturous book. Horrifying in small, cutting, personal ways, and in the more classic scare-in-a-dark-room way. But there's an iron rod of panicked strength that runs through the middle of it. A will to survive that is palpable. And by the time it is winding toward its conclusion, all the lies, the nightmares and the psychological games fall away and The Luminous Dead simply becomes a bloody race to the surface.
There's no forgiveness waiting there. No absolution. Only escape from the monsters down in the cave and — maybe — the ones that Gyre and Em brought down with them, too.

Why The Semi-Nomadic Himba Are So Good At Thinking Outside The Box,www.npr.org,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/04/07/704853100/why-the-semi-nomadic-himba-are-so-good-at-thinking-outside-the-box,"Enlarge this image Leigh Wells/Getty Images Leigh Wells/Getty Images Sarah Pope drives to work every day. It takes the cognitive neuroscientist 10 minutes to get to her lab Texas at Austin , and 10 minutes to get back home. She thought it was the fastest route, until one day a roadblock forced her to take a back road, which cut her commute time in half.
Why didn't she try the better route earlier? She says it's an example of a tendency to stick to the familiar way of solving a problem. Psychologists call it ""cognitive set."" Psychologists who are interested in the opposite kind of mindset – flexible thinking – have confirmed this bias toward the familiar in experiment after experiment.
But a study published in the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology earlier this year challenges this dogma by testing the flexible thinking of non-Western cultures – in this case, the semi-nomadic Himba people of Namibia.
The researchers found that when you assign a simple problem to the Himba and to a group of Westerners, the Himba are more cognitively flexible.
""These are exciting results,"" says Thea Ionescu , a developmental psychologist at Babeș-Bolyai University in Romania who was not involved in the study. ""There has been this implicit assumption that if we study Westerners, we study humankind,"" says Ionescu. ""This study suggests that's not necessarily the case.""
Flexible thinking is a fuzzy capacity for psychologists to describe and measure. But they generally think of it as our ability to incorporate past knowledge and the present context and add a bit of improvisational magic to solve problems well and quickly.
Now you don't always need to be flexible. Let's say your day-to-day existence is pretty much the same. ""If you're in an environment that is very predictable, the best solution is often the one that's always worked,"" says Pope .
In a more dynamic environment, where circumstances can change at the drop of a dime, there can be a benefit to breaking out of a rut and trying something new. But our bias towards the familiar can make it difficult to step out of our comfort zone.
To study the way we roll, psychologists have designed experiments that train participants to solve a problem one way, and then slip in the option of switching to a much faster method. Overwhelmingly, according to Pope, people tend not to take the shortcut. ""They continue with the learned approach, despite its inefficiency.""
Pope says that various versions of these tests have reached a similar conclusion, suggesting to the psychological community that ""cognitive set"" is an innate part of being human.
But Pope and Ionescu argue that conclusion is premature, because these studies have only considered WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) humans.
""WEIRD humans live in WEIRD environments at least evolutionarily speaking,"" says Pope. The fundamental workings of our minds were shaped thousands of years ago in environments vastly different than our present day surroundings. ""Only looking at Westerners limits the scope of our understanding of human cognition,"" says Pope.
To investigate cognitive flexibility in a non-WEIRD population, Pope traveled to Namibia to meet the Himba people. They live semi-nomadic lives in the remote deserts of northern Namibia.
""They are one of the few remaining remote cultures that actively resist Western influence,"" says Pope. Traditional Himba have virtually no formal education, and ""live in a much less predictable environment than Westerners,"" says Pope.
To compare cognitive flexibility across such vastly different cultures, Pope devised a simple test that didn't require language or math. A test subject looks at a touchscreen. A series of squares appear. The goal is to make them vanish.
With prompts, the subject learns that touching the squares in the order in which they appeared will make them disappear. Then a new batch of squares pop up, and the test subject starts over again.
But after a while, a triangle appears as well. You could stick to the strategy that worked before — touching the squares in a certain sequence to make them go away. But if you try something different — just touching the triangle — you'll achieve the goal faster: All the squares will vanish.
Pope found that fewer than 10 percent of Western subjects changed strategies unprompted. Most continued with the method they'd been taught, even though it's far less efficient.
By contrast, Himba participants chose the direct strategy approximately 40 percent of the time. In essence, they saw the triangle and figured, hey, why not try touching that?
According to Pope, these results suggest that Himba were more cognitively flexible. They were better able to switch away from a learned rule and use a shortcut when the opportunity presented itself.
But is this difference due to innate differences in problem solving between the groups? Or just by the fact that different groups can have different ideas of what counts as a problem or a solution?
To distinguish between these possibilities, Pope added a twist. Halfway through the trial, all 225 participants were nudged with the prompt: ""Don't be afraid to try new things.""
Upon hearing this, about 50 percent of Westerners tried the direct solution method, while the percentage of Himba who went for the triangle – about 40 – percent remained unchanged. Pope says this shows that the Westerners had the same ability to solve problems as the Himba – it's just that they weren't flexible in their thinking about the problem itself and possible solutions.
""I think Westerners are very limited in how they approach problems,"" says Pope. ""Obviously this is just one task and has to be replicated with other measures, but I think this does lay a foundation for understanding why Westerners are more focused on the familiar — something that is sufficient but not efficient.""
""Westerners would afterward say things like 'Oh, I didn't think I could do that' whereas the Himba seemed much more open to trying alternative solutions,"" says Pope.
According to Pope this study suggests cognitive set may be less ingrained in some cultures than others than previously thought. She has research plans to figure out why.
""One explanation may lie in education,"" says Pope. Formal education can train the mind to view problems in a certain kind of way. Without formal education, Himba may be freer to try different approaches. Understanding the relationship between education and creative problem solving could help resolve this question.
Another possibility is that different environments mold different ways of thinking. Lifestyles that are less predictable may require greater cognitive flexibility to survive.
""When you don't know where your food is going to come from when you wake up, it's important to be able to switch strategies if something isn't working,"" says Pope.
Pope says that she was struck by the willingness of the Himba ""to uproot their entire life at the drop of a hat,"" when water became scarce at a site they were living, or there was no more grass for their herds to eat.""
In their world, there's less permanency, ""which makes switching strategies an accepted part of their life.""
Our predictable Western lifestyles clearly offer benefits but they may come at the cost of less flexible thinking."

Hospital Closure Makes It Harder For A Town To Attract Retirees : Shots - Health News : NPR,www.npr.org,Blake Farmer,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/07/703932131/economic-ripples-hospital-closure-hurts-a-towns-ability-to-attract-retirees,"Enlarge this image Before it closed March 1, the 25-bed Columbia River Hospital, in Celina, Tenn., served the town of 1,500 residents.

Blake Farmer/WPLN When a rural community loses its hospital, health care becomes harder to come by in an instant. But a hospital closure also shocks a small town's economy. It shuts down one of its largest employers. It scares off heavy industry that needs an emergency room nearby. And in one Tennessee town, a lost hospital means lost hope of attracting more retirees.
Seniors, and their retirement accounts, have been viewed as potential saviors for many rural economies trying to make up for lost jobs. But the epidemic of rural hospital closures is threatening those dreams in places like Celina, Tenn.. The town of 1,500, whose 25-bed hospital closed March 1, has been trying to position itself as a retiree destination.
Shots - Health News Rethinking Rural Health Solutions To Save Patients And Communities ""I'd say, look elsewhere,"" says Susan Scovel, a Seattle transplant who came with her husband in 2015.
Scovel's despondence is especially noteworthy given that she leads the local chamber of commerce effort to attract retirees like herself. She considers the wooded hills and secluded lake to hold comparable scenic beauty to the Washington coast — with dramatically lower costs of living; she and a small committee plan getaway weekends for prospects to visit.
When she first toured the region before moving in 2015, Scovel and her husband, who had Parkinson's, made sure to scope out the hospital, on a hill overlooking the sleepy town square. And she's rushed to the hospital four times since he died in 2017.
""I have very high blood pressure, and they're able to do the IVs to get it down,"" Scovel says. ""This is an anxiety thing since my husband died. So now — I don't know.""
She says she can't in good conscience advise a senior with health problems to come join her in Celina.

Celina's Cumberland River Hospital had been on life support for years, operated by the city-owned medical center an hour away in Cookeville, which decided in late January to cut its losses after trying to find a buyer. Cookeville Regional Medical Center explains that the facility faced the grim reality for many rural providers.
""Unfortunately, many rural hospitals across the country are having a difficult time and facing the same challenges, like declining reimbursements and lower patient volumes, that Cumberland River Hospital has experienced,"" CEO Paul Korth said in a written statement.
Shots - Health News Vulnerable Rural Hospitals Face Tough Decisions On Questionable Billing Schemes Celina became the 11th rural hospital in Tennessee to close in recent years — more than in any state but Texas. Both states have refused to expand Medicaid in a way that covers more of the working poor. Even some Republicans now say the decision to not expand Medicaid has added to the struggles of rural health care providers.
The closest hospital is now 18 miles away. That adds another 30 minutes through mountain roads for those who need an X-ray or blood work. For those in the back of an ambulance, that bit of time could make the difference between life or death.

Blake Farmer/WPLN ""We have the capability of doing a lot of advanced life support, but we're not a hospital,"" says emergency management director Natalie Boone.
The area is already limited in its ambulance service, with two of its four trucks out of service.
Once a crew is dispatched, Boone says, it's committed to that call. Adding an hour to the turnaround time means someone else could likely call with an emergency and be told — essentially — to wait in line.
""What happens when you have that patient that doesn't have that extra time?"" Boone asks. ""I can think of at least a minimum of two patients [in the last month] that did not have that time.""
Residents are bracing for cascading effects. Susan Bailey hasn't retired yet, but she's close. She's spent nearly 40 years as a registered nurse, including her early career at Cumberland River.

toggle caption Quirk Books Salvador Dalí­'s idea for a Marx Brothers movie was never made — but it's been resurrected as a graphic novel.
Quirk Books This is a story about something that didn't happen. A movie that was never made. It was supposed to be a collaboration between the Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí and the Marx Brothers.
YouTube Dalí was the toast of the town in 1970 when he appeared on the Dick Cavett TV show. Elegantly dressed in a burgundy velvet sport coat and sparkly vest, this titan of the surrealist movement strode on stage with a gold handled cane in his right hand — and on his left, a live anteater on a leash, which he promptly dumped in the lap of another guest, the actress Lillian Gish. When Gish asked him if his work had a message for people, he shot back ""No message."" ""Could you invent one?"" pleaded Cavett.
Back in 1937, Dalí was much less famous when he showed up at MGM studios with his buddy Harpo Marx to pitch a movie treatment. The Marx Brothers, on the other hand, were at the height of their popularity, thanks to their hijinks in films like Duck Soup , A Night at the Opera and Animal Crackers .
But studio head Louis B. Mayer didn't particularly like the Marx Brothers or know what to make of Salvador Dalí, and so he killed the project the artist had titled Giraffes on Horseback Salad . Now, writer Josh Frank has turned that somewhat incomprehensible screenplay into a graphic novel. ""It was crazy surreal,"" he says, ""and totally not digestible, and Groucho said quote-unquote 'it wouldn't play.'""

Amazon Independent Booksellers And so that screenplay slipped into the realm of legendary lost treasures — that is, until Frank got wind of it, tracked it down at a museum in France, and recruited a team to help him put it together. The team included Spanish illustrator Manuela Pertega and comedian Tim Heidecker, who helped come up with gags because Dalí's production notes just said, ""insert Marx Brothers routine here."" Frank says the collaboration worked. ""Next thing you know, I'm creating a new piece of Marx Brothers art for the world, and it's a dream come true.""
Book Reviews 'Giraffes On Horseback Salad' Tells The Lost Story Of Harpo Marx And Salvador Dalí But we've put the cart before the giraffe here. Let's back up. First, what's with that name? Frank hasn't a clue. ""Asking me what Giraffes on Horseback Salad means is asking me, 'lobsterphone,' you know?"" he laughs. ""However, what I've always thought, ever since I first heard that name, is that to me it's the perfect name for a Marx Brothers movie written by Salvador Dalí. Because it has that — A Night at the Opera , A Day at the Races , Giraffes on Horseback Salad . It works somehow.""
Next, the plot — such as it is. A businessman named Jimmy finds his well ordered upper-crust life turned inside out when he meets the Surrealist Woman. She's a stunning shape-shifter who discombobulates the world around her. Eventually she's arrested for her surrealist crimes and winds up in court where the mayhem of the Marx Brothers ultimately liberates her. These moments are depicted in the book as the trippiest of swirling LSD experiences.

""When he first saw a Marx Brothers movie, it put him in a trance, because he felt he was watching the human embodiment of surrealism in its purest form,"" Frank says. ""All of the Marx Brothers, but specifically Harpo, because Harpo was unbridled, almost animalistic, so he loved Harpo.""
Harpo, who never spoke on screen, was probably the zaniest member of the family, known for playing the harp and pulling items from under his trench coat — like 300 knives or a hot cup of coffee or a blowtorch — and of course, honking his horn. He was in Paris in 1936 on a publicity tour for A Night at the Opera when he met Dalí. Even though they didn't have a language in common, the pair clicked, and Dalí decided to incorporate the Marx Brothers into the movie treatment he was working on.

Marx Family Harpo's son Bill Marx remembers being maybe 7 or 8 when he came across a Xerox copy of Giraffes . ""And I started reading it, and I really couldn't make heads or tails of it,"" he says. Bill, a musician and composer, was too young to remember when Dalí came to the States to paint his dad and pitch his film. But there were telltale signs of the friendship — like the Dalí pen and ink sketches hanging in his bedroom growing up. There were also stories about the full-sized surrealist harp Dalí had sent to Harpo. It came wrapped in cellophane, with the harp frame dripping forks and spoons and barbed wire replacing the strings. But Bill Marx says they didn't have the instrument very long. ""My mother, who was very practical, she said I'm sorry, I can't look at this anymore, and she threw it in the garbage."" Just imagine if there was some lucky dumpster diver that day.
Harpo was also an accomplished painter, producing some 300 works, and Dalí sat for him during his California trip. Bill Marx say his dad's time with the artist may have been brief, but it's effect on both of men was long lasting. Author Josh Frank agrees. ""So this whole meeting of these two strange and wonderful minds, I really felt even though it was a short amount of time they were together that they profoundly affected each other because Harpo went on to continue painting and take it even more seriously.""
And, says Frank, Dalí was also left inspired — but ultimately unfulfilled too. ""This short time he had with Harpo was, I feel like, a really great lost moment that created a work of art that until now has not really been able to be seen.""
Dalí envisioned a huge Hollywood production for Giraffes on Horseback Salad , complete with music by Cole Porter. While the project never did get the green light, there is a now a soundtrack to go along with the graphic novel — including music, complete with a faux Groucho. And so just maybe, up in some dreamy surrealist heaven, the real Groucho — along with Harpo, Chico and Salvador Dalí — is smiling down."

Sara Stathas for NPR Sara Stathas for NPR George Berzsenyi mentored thousands of high school students in mathematics.
Sara Stathas for NPR George Berzsenyi is a retired math professor living in Milwaukee County. Most people have never heard of him.
But Berzsenyi has had a remarkable impact on American science and mathematics. He has mentored thousands of high school students, including some who became among the best mathematicians and scientists in the country.
I learned about Berzsenyi from a chance conversation with a scientist named Vamsi Mootha .
In the late 1980s, when Mootha was in high school in Beaumont, Texas, he won a science fair. A few days later, a letter arrived in the mail.
""It said, 'Dear Vamsi, Congratulations on winning the Houston Science Fair , this is quite the accomplishment,' "" Mootha recalls.
""But then when I started reading the next paragraph, I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach,"" Mootha says.
The letter went on to say that the math problem young Vamsi solved to win the fair had been solved hundreds of years earlier.
""Of course, the letter went on, 'You can't be expected to know this because you're only a sophomore in high school, and perhaps you haven't had the appropriate mentorship ... If you're interested in solving original problems, why don't you write back to me.' ""
The letter was signed ""George Berzsenyi."" At the time, Berzsenyi was a math professor at Lamar University in Beaumont.
Mootha says the letter upset him because he thought he had discovered something new.
But then he became intrigued. ""I said, 'You know what, I'm going to take him up on his offer and write back to him.' ""
They got together and the older mathematician and the young prodigy hit it off. Berzsenyi would give Mootha those original problems to solve ... and an appreciation for mathematics.
""He also sort of instilled in me a love for mathematics and a love for sort of elegant mathematics that makes sense,"" Mootha says

Courtesy of George Berzsenyi Eventually Mootha headed off to Stanford University, then Harvard medical school where he works today.
A half-dozen or so years ago, Mootha found out he had a lot of company in being mentored by George Berzsenyi.
""I share an office with somebody named Joel Hirschhorn ,"" Mootha tells me. Hirschhorn is a geneticist at Harvard and the Broad Institute. Mootha and Hirschhorn were trying to solve a math problem related to their work.
""Joel is up at the board, he's drawing out some equations,"" Mootha recalls. ""After we worked on the problem, we're just reminiscing about our high school days in mathematics.
""So I start to tell Joel about how I got this letter after winning a science fair,"" Mootha says, ""and before I could actually finish that sentence, he actually asked me, 'Wait. Did that letter come from somebody named George Berzsenyi?' And I said, 'Yes, how do you know?' And he said, 'I used to communicate with George Berzsenyi also.' ""
Hirschhorn would send in solutions to problems in a math newsletter Berzsenyi edited.

Sara Stathas for NPR The coincidence was astonishing, and then it happened again.
Two weeks later, Mootha is telling Sebastian Seung this story. Seung is a neuroscientist who at the time was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Before he can finish the story, Mootha says, ""Sebastian interrupts me and says, 'Wait, was that George Berzsenyi?' and I said, 'Yes, how do you know?' ""
Mootha soon found that Berzsenyi has affected the lives of many top scientists and mathematicians.
At this point, I knew I had to meet Berzsenyi. So I went to meet him at his house in Milwaukee County where he lives with his wife, Kay.
Berzsenyi is 80 now. He was born in Hungary. In high school, he fell in love with mathematics. Hungary punches above its weight in the subject. The country has produced many famous mathematicians.
Berzsenyi came to America and got a doctorate in mathematics.
He joined the math faculty at Lamar in Beaumont, where he started mentoring talented high school math students.
He created a math magazine patterned on KöMaL , which he had read in Hungary while in high school. The magazine only existed for a few years. He's hoping someday someone will revive it.
There were tricky math problems in the magazine. When students sent in solutions, he would send back comments.
He was surprised how willing the students were to work with him. He realized he was filling an unmet need. Berzsenyi said most high schools don't have the expertise to help these bright math students, and professional mathematicians by and large can't be bothered.
Berzsenyi loved watching young people's math talents grow.

Courtesy of George Berzsenyi ""In spite of their youth, I considered them mathematically supremely mature and treated them in such fashion ... I really admired them,"" he says.
Over the years, Berzsenyi worked with thousands of kids. He didn't expect all of them to become mathematicians. In addition to math, Berzsenyi's protégés have gone on to biology, business and even law.

""I first met Dr. Berzsenyi through the young scholars programs in 1995,"" says Yvonne Lai , an assistant math professor the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. She says Berzsenyi created the program as kind of a summer math camp for high school students.
As the camp was coming to an end, Lai recalls, ""He assigned us a group of 10 math competition-style problems that we could hand in as a final assignment in 10 years.""
The group stayed in touch using a mailing list. And about a decade later, ""somebody wrote the mailing list and said, 'It's been 10 years, we have a problem set due,' "" Lai says with a laugh.
An assignment due 10 years later is just the kind of clever idea George Berzsenyi used to keep students engaged in math.
Berzsenyi is proud of what his math protégés have accomplished. Ferrell Wheeler does cryptography work for the National Security Agency. Kiran Kedlaya works on number theory at the University of California, San Diego. Noam Elkies became a tenured math faculty member at Harvard when he was just 26 years old.
The protégés are uniformly grateful for Berzsenyi's attention.
It is ""through programs that George Berzsenyi developed that I think I got the courage to become a math major,"" says Lai.
""His influence on me is hard to describe,"" says Wheeler. ""He was like a second father to me. And he helped me immensely.""
""It's hard to find somebody who is that passionate about discovering the future generation of talent in any field, but particularly in mathematics,"" says Kedlaya.
Of all the students Berzsenyi told me about in the hours we spoke, one stood out: Jimmy Wilson. ""In the long run, Jimmy was probably my major discovery,"" Berzsenyi says.
Wilson almost fell through the cracks. When he was a high school freshman, Wilson took part in a math competition. Berzsenyi happened to look over the shoulder of the judge scoring Wilson's solution to one of the tough problems in the competition.
""The solution he gave to the problem was a perfect solution,"" Berzsenyi says. ""Somehow, the person who was grading the solution didn't recognize that it actually solved the problem, and very elegantly.""
So Berzsenyi overruled the first judge and gave Wilson a top score.

Courtesy of George Berzsenyi Later in high school, Berzseny took Wilson and a bunch of other students to a math competition on the East Coast.
The concluding event at the competition was a game called Buzz.
""The kid never heard of this before. I never heard of it before,"" Berzsenyi says.
It's a counting game. Students stand in a circle and take turns counting, but there are complex rules where you replace numbers with words like ""buzz,"" ""bang"" or ""whack."" Say the wrong word and you're out. It's fiendishly hard to keep all the rules straight, especially as the count reaches into the hundreds.
Eventually, there were just two students left: the previous year's champion and Wilson.
""It was just unbelievable to watch,"" Berzsenyi recalls. ""Very methodically, Jimmy just succeeded where the other kid didn't.""

Meredith Rizzo/NPR For all his natural aptitude for math, at first Wilson didn't do well in college. He dropped out of Texas A&M. Berzsenyi says it was because Wilson hadn't really learned how to study.
""At that time, I didn't recognize some of the things I should have been doing,"" he says. ""I still feel bad about it.""
""I don't think he needs to feel that way at all,"" says Jimmy Wilson. Today he goes by Jim Wilson. He now has his college degree. He still lives in Beaumont, Texas. He has worked as an educator in the local school system for most of his adult life.
He's proud of what he did at that East Coast math competition, proud of his math skills. He's especially proud of the day George Berzsenyi gave him a Rubik's Cube.
"" 'If you can solve it, you can keep it,' "" Wilson recalls Berzsenyi saying.
He solved it in short order.
Wilson recalled Berzsenyi telling him how impressed he was: "" 'Oh, by the way, I think you're the first person in the country to solve it.' "" The cube Berzsenyi gave Wilson was one he had brought back from Hungary, where the Rubik's Cube was invented. The U.S. version had yet to go on the market — it did so in 1980.
It's true Wilson didn't achieve the kind of academic fame or financial success that some of Berzsenyi's other students did.
""I could look back with some regrets,"" Wilson says. But he has also found great fulfillment in helping the students he has taught over the years to find the joy in math.
""To this day, as I reach out to help students to improve their skills, it's because of that relationship that started when I was in high school with Dr. Berzsenyi,"" Wilson says.

Shell Withdraws From Oil Lobby Group : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710781487/shell-withdraws-from-oil-lobby-group,"Royal Dutch Shell is withdrawing from an oil lobbying group because of disagreements about environmental policy. NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro speaks with Amy Harder of Axios about the move.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
When you think of groups who are working to fight climate change, you probably don't think of big oil companies. But this past week, Royal Dutch Shell said it's withdrawing from a D.C.-based oil lobbying group because of disagreements about environmental policy. Amy Harder, who covers energy for Axios, tells us how that decision got made.
AMY HARDER: Shell said last year - under pressure from investors, I should note - that it was going to do a review of all its memberships of trade associations around the world. And it found that one was wholly misaligned with its positions on climate change, namely that Shell supports acting on climate change and pricing carbon emissions. And it found that a D.C.-based membership group that represents oil and gas refineries specifically did not align with that. So it is not going to renew its membership, but it did keep its membership in all others, including, notably, the American Petroleum Institute, which really is the most influential trade group here in Washington on these issues.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: When you say that they did it because under pressure, what kind of pressure?
HARDER: Well, the investor angle in this broader story of what oil and gas companies are doing on climate change is really important because investors are becoming more activist, and there's this process called shareholder democracy where investors urge companies to do things. And so it's a little bit wonky, but it's incredibly important because it ends up with things like this, which is a commitment to review its trade associations. And to my knowledge, no other oil and gas company has really committed to doing this. So Shell could be an outlier, or it could be the beginning of a trend.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: I think some people might find it surprising that a company like Shell is being vocal about climate change.
HARDER: The big picture is that for a very long time - for the next several decades at least - Shell will remain an oil and gas fossil fuel company. But they're starting to see the writing on the wall with this energy transition happening around the world. And they want to make sure that they stay profitable and relevant. But I think there's a lot of nuance and details that can get glossed over. And one important one is that their investments in this space and their work in this space such as leaving one trade group but staying in, you know, more than a dozen others, you know, is likely not going to be enough for a lot of really activist environmentalists who want wholesale changes at these companies. But what these companies say is that we are, you know, a publicly traded company with investors, and we do need to return a profit for these investors. So these companies are really trying to strike a balance there.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Do you expect other companies to follow suit, or will this put pressure on some of these trade organizations to change their position on climate change?
HARDER: Shell is certainly one of the most progressive big oil companies in this space, but it's not the only one. One interesting trend that I'm looking at is to what degree there's a growing division between European companies and American companies. The American companies are far more cautious because just the culture in America is a lot different than that in Europe, which is - you know, it has a big climate policy across the continent. Its people are a little bit more progressive in this area than America. So that's the backdrop. There is, however, a trend here in Washington with both Exxon and ConocoPhillips actually funding a carbon tax advocacy campaign. They're actually urging Congress to pass a carbon tax. So I think that's significant, even if they haven't taken these other steps that say Shell has to remove their memberships from some of these groups.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Amy Harder of Axios, thank you so much.
HARDER: Thank you.

Noah Fortson/NPR It was the morning after the election of America's first black president, and Kwame Onwuachi was hungover. He'd been partying all night. He was dealing drugs to survive after he dropped out of college. He was, he says, lost.
But when he saw President Obama, something clicked. ""I thought, I can do anything. And I immediately flushed everything that I had down the toilet and was like, I need to find myself,"" Onwuachi recalls.
He went to the grocery store and bought ingredients to cook a chicken curry. ""I didn't know that I wanted to cook, but it was like, here's something that I'm familiar with,"" he says. ""Here's something that brings back these fond memories. And here's something that grounds me. And I want to explore this a little bit more.""
These days, Onwuachi is a rising star in the food world — the executive chef at Kith and Kin , a celebrated Afro-Caribbean restaurant in Washington, D.C., and a nominee this year for a prestigious James Beard award.

Amazon Independent Booksellers His road to the rarefied world of fine cuisine has had many fits and starts, which he details in a new memoir, Notes From A Young Black Chef. Eventually, there would be a stint on Top Chef, work in the best restaurants in America, the opening of his first place in D.C. — and its rapid and painful closure. But that road began in a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx, where he grew up with his mother and sister.
""My mother was an accountant and she wanted to figure out a way to spend time with us while still taking care of the bills,"" Onwuachi says. ""So she started a catering company from the house, and me and my sister became her first two employees.""
Times were hard. ""There were a lot of times where we didn't have lights,"" he says, ""and my mother made up a game called Lights Out, where we all slept in the living room together and put candles everywhere. She shielded me with love, instead of revealing to me the harsh realities that were going on.""
Onwuachi's life story is written in his recipes. His mother's family hails from Louisiana and Trinidad. Creole and Caribbean flavors infuse his cooking. On his father's side, there are roots in Jamaica and Nigeria, where Onwuachi spent two years as a tween.

Noah Fortson/NPR ""I was definitely veering off on the wrong path as a kid growing up in the South Bronx,"" he says. So his mother sent him to live with his father's relatives in Nigeria. ""I spent a couple of years there, learning about my culture, my ancestors' traditions that I wasn't familiar with. And then inherently, I also learned a lot about cooking.""
In Nigeria, he says, ""if you wanted 20 wings, you had to raise 10 chickens. You saw where the food came from.""
He took all that experience into the high temples of American cuisine – first, Per Se, and then Eleven Madison Park , both in New York City. He says he wanted to learn from the best.
""It was and still is an amazing restaurant,"" he says of the highly acclaimed Per Se. ""The food that they produce, the level of attention to detail that goes into every single aspect — whether it's the receiving of produce to putting that said produce through a process of fabrication, the cookery and then onto the plate. It's a symphony.""
But Onwuachi's memoir is not a simple story about triumph in the face of poverty and struggle. It's also a meditation on what goes on behind that perfect façade --- what it is like to be a black man in this rarefied world. He tells the story of alerting the head chef to a word that has a double meaning as a racist slur that was being used on the menu. He was told not to worry about it because ""black people don't eat here.""

Noah Fortson/NPR ""These jokes happen more than you think,"" Onwuachi says. ""We get looked over [for advancement] more than you think. And it's not the direct racism. ... it's the unspoken racism that's hurtful.""
So Onwauchi left to open his own restaurant. He was only 26, and people kept telling him he had not paid his dues. When his first D.C. venture, Shaw Bijou, closed in under three months in a highly publicized failure , people seemed almost gleeful.
""It infuriated me at the time,"" Onwuachi says. ""People telling you that you haven't paid your dues — what are you talking? I've been afforded an opportunity. Who in their right mind is going to say, 'Thank you for this million-dollar offer, but I need to go and pay my dues a little bit more and then I'll call you back if you're still interested'?""
These days, Onwuachi is earning rave reviews for his new restaurant, Kith and Kin. And he wants people to think about why critics and customers deem only certain cuisines – Italian, French, Japanese — worthy of the name fine dining.
The Salt Why Hunting Down 'Authentic Ethnic Food' Is A Loaded Proposition ""You don't have Southeast Asian there. You don't have Caribbean [food], or all of the [African] diaspora, which is like 54 different countries. You know, one of them's got to have a food that you can respect at a high level, right?""
To change minds, he says, ""I think it's going to take a lot more chefs of color to introduce these this type of cuisine to people at a high level.""
The Salt Cheap Eats, Cheap Labor: The Hidden Human Costs Of Those Lists Onwuachi sees his own culinary repertoire as a counter to these food world stereotypes. While his food encompasses a range of African, Caribbean, African-American and other influences, one cuisine he doesn't do is what some diners might expect of a young black chef: soul food.
""My roots are not fried chicken and mac and cheese and collard greens,"" he says. ""I mean, that's part of it. But when I have family reunions, we don't cook that food. We cook gumbo and shrimp. So those are the things that resonate with me. But also, I'm a black chef. So the food that I cook is black.""
""I don't need to be pigeonholed into soul food or even Creole food or even just Caribbean food or West African food. I'm a culmination of many different cultures, and the ideas that I have are because of that."""

Every morning, B. wakes up at dawn to begin her day in a rural farming village in western Kosovo. She starts the fire, bakes fresh bread for the home, feeds her cow, then tends to her homemade dairy products that she prepares from a small room.
""I'm restless, I have to do something,"" B., 51, says. ""I feel like my brain is more quiet when I do this in my own house.""
Later in the day, she packages her different types of fresh cheese and yogurt and gets them ready to be picked up and sold at a new shop in Gjakova — a bustling city around 30 minutes away from her home.
B. is one of the estimated 20,000 women and men who were raped and tortured by Serbian police and the Yugoslav army during the 1998-1999 Kosovo war against Serbia. The exact number is difficult to determine, given the sensitivities surrounding the topic of wartime rape in this nation of 1.8 million people. In Kosovo's conservative and traditional society, wartime rape victims continue to be stigmatized, shamed and isolated not only by society, but also by their families, from whom many survivors have kept the rape a secret. That's why survivors are not using their names in this story.
""In general, in cases of sexual violence, the shame and guilt is unfortunately usually put on the victim and not on the perpetrator. In Kosovo, the case is the same,"" says Rozafa Kelmendi, project manager with the Women, Peace and Security sector at U.N. Women in Kosovo. She notes that it was only in 2008 that the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution condemning sexual violence as a tool of war.
""So if it took this long for the [United Nations] to recognize this as a crime, then it takes much longer for the society to see conflicted-related sexual violence as a weapon of war and a crime committed on the victims — and not something that should be considered as a [source of] shame,"" Kelmendi says.
What's more, many survivors have had a hard time earning an income because of the trauma they suffered after the war and the lack of job opportunities in Kosovo. But now, 20 years after the end of the conflict, a new store in Kosovo aims to change that.
Medica Gjakova, one of four NGOs in Kosovo working with survivors of sexual violence, opened an artisanal food shop last December, with the help of theGerman Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), some of the main international donors involved in supporting NGOs in Kosovo.
A new artisanal food shop in Gjakova, in western Kosovo, sells organic products sourced from the homes of survivors of sexual violence during the war.

Valerie Plesch/for NPR
The shop sells a variety of organic products sourced from around two dozen survivors' farms and homes in surrounding villages. Items include different types of fresh cheese, creamy yogurt, three varieties of honey, apple, apricot, raspberry and blackberry jams, bright red pepper spreads, shelled walnuts and eggs. The shop is part of Medica Gjakova's economic empowerment project, which helps survivors become entrepreneurs and earn an income – in some cases, for the first time in their lives.
It is the first shop of its kind in Kosovo and is a big step towards helpingthese women to lead more independent lives from the comfort and safety of their homes, which makes it more convenient for them to work. Medica Gjakova is in the process of registering the shop as a social enterprise and is training other survivors on entrepreneurship and developing their catering and culinary skills.
""We saw that economic empowerment is very important for the women because they are much more self-confident. And when it comes to the family, they are able to bring some money to the family and [thus] they are much stronger within the family,"" says Mirlinda Sada, executive director of NGO Medica Gjakova. ""We are trying to prepare the women to be the leaders of these enterprises,"" Sada says.
The ancient city of Gjakova was nearly destroyed during the war. Many war crimes took place in this city and surrounding villages, especially during the 78-day NATO bombing campaign in 1999. That campaign eventually ended the war and drove the forces of former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic out of Kosovo.
The artisanal shop is located on a busy street in the city center. The window display shows an assortment of neatly arranged fresh farm eggs, walnuts, pumpkins and apples. Since its opening, the store has had to constantly restock its supply of spicy pickled vegetables, nuts and dairy products, thanks to demand from customers who come here looking for fresh, homemade traditional food.
""People are writing [messages] to Medica, asking where they can buy these products and [saying] that they are really good,"" Sada says.
Medica Gjakova — the NGO — has provided counseling to approximately 400 survivors of sexual violence since the end of the war. Though many survivors continue to receive treatment and aren't working, others feel ready to move forward with their lives.
""This is very important because after they were empowered [through counseling and other services], they needed something more,"" Sada says. ""Having a job and working is a kind of therapy."" Enlarge this image

This is especially true for survivors like M.
""[Working with food] helps me with my peace and with my health,"" says M. from her home in a rural village near Gjakova, where heavy fighting took place during the war. ""Time goes by and I forget the past.""
M. now spends her days listening to music from a small radio in her work space outside her home, still on her family compound. There, she makesjars of homemade ajvar , a traditional Balkan red pepper spread, and tangy pickled vegetables known as torshi , which are popular accompaniments to Persian, Middle Eastern and Balkan dishes. ""This is where I feel the best,"" M., 57, says about her work space.
""I receive a lot of compliments from my clients, which is satisfying,"" M. says about her products. ""I gain pleasure from that — when I feel like I can do good for others, too. At the same time, my finances are better. I've helped my children a lot with their education. And I help my husband and the family.""
She earns around $275 per month – nearly equivalent to the average salary earned by women in Kosovo, according to Amnesty International .
Medica Gjakova is planning on opening one more shop in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, at the end of April, as well as an online shop.
""So this is really the cherry on the cake, because we now know the women really are able to ... have a profit, earn money, and to be stronger and to have the voice in the family,"" Sada says. Facebook "
What To Know About Israel's Elections : NPR,www.npr.org,Daniel Estrin,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710781501/what-to-know-about-israels-elections,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is dogged by corruption allegations but could be re-elected as the country votes Tuesday. His main challenger is a retired general promising clean government.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
There is a very important election taking place in Israel this week, and Israelis are faced with a central question - whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should continue to lead the country after a decade in power. He's facing corruption allegations, but there is a good chance he'll still get re-elected. And in these final days of the campaign, he has pledged a dramatic policy change that has profound implications. He says he will annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, which could make it almost impossible to create a viable independent Palestinian state. NPR's Daniel Estrin has more from Jerusalem.
(CHEERING)
DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Netanyahu greeted a crowd of supporters this weekend with a warning.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: (Foreign language spoken).
ESTRIN: ""The right-wing government is in danger,"" he said. ""If I don't win, a left-wing government will come to power."" Netanyahu is fighting his toughest race yet. The police have recommended corruption charges against Netanyahu for backroom dealings with businessmen. An indictment could come within months. And Netanyahu is facing a formidable challenger, former military chief of staff Benny Gantz. He wants to replace Netanyahu after 10 years in power.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BENNY GANTZ: I think Benjamin Netanyahu have done a lot for the country, but as we say, enough is enough.
(APPLAUSE)
ESTRIN: Gantz is new to politics, but he's teamed up with other former military generals to compete with Netanyahu's reputation as Mr. Security. Gantz's Blue and White Party is named after the colors of the Israeli flag, and he's run on a message of unifying the country. Gantz accuses Netanyahu of inciting against Israel's Palestinian-Arab citizens and embracing extremists by forging a political alliance with the far-right Jewish Power Party. Gantz has also suggested Netanyahu was behind a propaganda network of fake Twitter accounts, though Israel's election commissioner found no evidence of that. For his part, Netanyahu has waged an aggressive campaign on social media.
(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Foreign language spoken).
ESTRIN: This video on Netanyahu's Facebook page shows a split screen. On one side are Gantz and his political partner, a TV anchorman turned politician. They're branded as dangerous and inexperienced. On the other side of the screen, Netanyahu and President Trump. Netanyahu has been campaigning on his close ties with Trump. Netanyahu's party also put out a video it later apologized for - showing a military graveyard and claiming Gantz would lead a reckless left-wing government and cause hundreds of deaths. Netanyahu's campaign has also portrayed Gantz as mentally unstable, and Netanyahu calls the corruption allegations against him a left-wing media witch hunt. Israeli political analyst Reuven Hazan.
REUVEN HAZAN: Netanyahu will stop at nothing, and I would not want to oppose him because he is very, very good at campaigning.
ESTRIN: Israeli political journalist Tal Shalev summed up the campaign in a panel of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
TAL SHALEV: For the first time, one could say there was a real alternative for Netanyahu, but the Blue and White Party didn't hurt Netanyahu.
ESTRIN: And neither did the corruption allegations against him, she says. Polls show Gantz hasn't succeeded in wooing enough voters away from Netanyahu's traditional allies, right-wing parties, which are predicted to win a slight majority of the votes. Netanyahu could then form a government with those right-wing parties. Many of them are pushing for Israel to annex Jewish settlements in lands Palestinians demand for their own state. In a TV interview Saturday night, Netanyahu pledged he would do so if he wins.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
NETANYAHU: (Foreign language spoken).
ESTRIN: He said, ""will we go to the next phase? The answer is yes. We will go to the next phase to extend Israeli sovereignty."" The race is close. Some right-wing parties could choose an alliance with Gantz, crowning him prime minister. Polls show there are still many undecided voters, like Sarit Tepper. She doesn't want to vote for Netanyahu but doesn't know who'd be better.
SARIT TEPPER: I have nothing to compare to, so it's very difficult to say. It's a difficult country. No one else ever tried to be his place for a while now. People - other people try, but no one succeeded.
ESTRIN: The vote is on Tuesday. Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Jerusalem.

Little Green Eyes/Courtesy of the artist Jackson Stell began his music career making hip-hop beats. As a producer, he had gone by J Beatz. Then some years ago, he felt stuck and had a change of heart. He decided to make a different type of music and he decided he would try his hand at singing on his tracks. Now, this beatsmith-turned-vocalist is known as Big Wild and says singing and writing lyrics enabled him to make music that feels true to himself.
Superdream, the debut album of Big Wild, is a collection of funky, electronic dance jams that features his own voice for the first time. Stell says his singing still comes as a surprise to his own his family members.
Heavy Rotation Kehlani, Royal Canoe, Big Wild And More: 10 Songs Public Radio Can't Stop Playing ""They are still trying to wrap their heads around the fact that I am singing, because growing up I never sang,"" Stell explains. ""I, for the most part, have been a really quiet person, but especially with music, I was all about production.""
Stell was inspired to change his musical course and stage moniker to Big Wild about five years ago when the artist visited California. ""It was kind of at a moment in my life where I was making a big change and I just wanted to embody that spirit of adventurousness of being curious,"" he says.
YouTube This switch paid off. His collaboration with Tove Styrke, "" Aftergold "" became a hit. In 2017, Stell released his first EP, Invincible, gaining millions of plays. The musician carried that adventurous spirit into Superdream, a collection of songs deeply rooted in his life. Stell wrote the song ""Maker"" after receiving a thyroid cancer diagnosis five years ago, going through multiple surgeries and gaining a whole new perspective on what music he wanted to make.
""It was important for me to write about struggles and challenges I've had, but offer or put a positive focus on it,"" Stell says.

Khalifa Haftar, whose forces in Libya are advancing on the government in Tripoli
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
Since the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, Libya has struggled to establish and maintain a stable government. Now the country is on the verge of an all-out civil war. Libya is divided between the U.N.-backed government located in Tripoli in the west, protected by a coalition of militias. To the east in Benghazi, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar has his own militias. He controls almost two-thirds of the country, including the major oilfields. And his forces are marching on Tripoli. I spoke with Mansour El-Kikhia via Skype. He's in Benghazi, and he's a professor of international relations and Middle East politics at the University of Texas at San Antonio. He told me he believes Haftar has brought much-needed stability to eastern Libya.
MANSOUR EL-KIKHIA: When I met him a couple of months ago, I said, listen. You have fought against Islamic radicalism. And you have saved Benghazi and eastern Libya from the terrorist threat. But if you try to run for office, you will lose all that because Libyans are difficult to govern. And I said to him, do you have any aspirations with that? He says, no. I want to rise above this. So I think he sees a real threat to Libya by the existence of these elements. And unfortunately, the international community and the United Nations, they are supporting a government that has no power. And in the end, that government that has no power is being run by militias.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Some people would counter that, actually, Haftar's forces are also comprised of militias with little ideology, some elements within them are so-called extremists and that he is no better than the forces he's purporting to counter.
EL-KIKHIA: I mean, I hate to disagree with this. I mean, Haftar is not perfect. I don't say he's perfect. But he has a Libyan army. They might have started off as militias. But now they are inducted into regular army. And more important, they try to paint Haftar into a warlord. You know, he's not. He has been authorized by the only representative body in the country, which is the Libyan Parliament. And so, please, don't get me wrong. I am not enamored with Haftar. And the last thing I want to see in Libya is another military dictatorship. I don't want to see that.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So why is Haftar making this move to take Tripoli now?
EL-KIKHIA: In Arabic, we say, nobody feels the pain more than somebody standing in the fire. Libya is in desperate situation. Country's wealth is being spent on nonsense, support of terrorist activities that are taking place in the Middle East. And Libyans are in poverty. Inflation is extremely high. The unemployment is extremely high. People are hungry. And a number of attempts has been made to reach an accord and agreements through the U.N. But nothing came out of that because the government in Tripoli can't take any decisions given the fact that it has to consult with the militias first, whom it depends on for protection.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Mansour El-Kikhia, thank you so much.
EL-KIKHIA: Thank you.

Maybe Donnie Gardiner, the facilities superintendent at Fenway Park. He’s responsible for getting the 107-year-old ballpark ready for the Red Sox home opener.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
So who has the toughest job in baseball? It might just be Donnie Gardiner. He’s the facility superintendent at Fenway Park in Boston. That means he makes sure that the oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball keeps running. Shira Springer of member station WBUR visited Gardiner as he got ready for another Red Sox season.
DONNIE GARDINER: Come on in. Welcome to Fenway.
SHIRA SPRINGER, BYLINE: Donnie Gardiner greets me at Gate D, then quickly walks to the visitors’ clubhouse. He doesn’t want to waste time, not with the Red Sox home opener fast approaching.
GARDINER: We have city inspections we have to worry about. We have construction we have to finish up. We have just all kinds of things going on right now.
SPRINGER: When you step into the visitors’ clubhouse, you see what he means.
(SOUNDBITE OF CONSTRUCTION TOOLS RUNNING)
SPRINGER: Workers are installing walls, putting ceilings back together, painting, sanding, sawing, hammering. As Gardiner moves from the new whirlpool room to the new training room to the new video coaching room, he gets updates and gives advice.
GARDINER: Now we’ve just got to see if we can find some room up there to change the filters.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: It’ll be close. We’ll get them in.
GARDINER: Everything’s been close.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I would wait on this because I don’t know where we’re going to cut the line. But I think we’re going to cut the line.
SPRINGER: The same thing happens when he visits the Red Sox clubhouse area and checks on manager Alex Cora’s new larger office and other upgrades. Teams have outgrown Fenway’s cozy clubhouses. So there’s always plenty of work to do for the Red Sox and the visitors.
GARDINER: I’m not playing one side over the other. Whatever we do for one, we do for the other.
SPRINGER: Donnie Gardiner is 5-foot-3 and a soft-spoken but commanding presence in the clubhouses. It’s clear he knows how to handle the unpredictable challenges that come with renovating a 107-year-old ballpark. He should. He’s worked there for three decades.
GARDINER: You know, everything we’ve done to this place has not taken away from the allure of the park. The feel is still there. This building has a feel to it. I mean, it does for me personally. You know, I’ve touched every inch of this place at one time or another.
SPRINGER: And with a footprint as small as Fenway’s, every inch matters. Gardiner likes to say he plays a game of inches. He’s constantly figuring out how to make the best use of limited space, especially in the clubhouse areas. Sometimes he’s also working around brass waterlines that have stood the test of time. And during offseason renovations, sometimes he’s uncovering remnants from Fenway’s past.
GARDINER: When we ripped up the concourse a few years ago, we were – it was like an archeological dig, you know, finding the old nip bottles, old shoes. And the place was, I’m assuming, heated by coal because we found a lot of coal ash out in centerfield.
SPRINGER: When the ballpark reopens for business each season, Gardiner’s focus shifts from renovations to preventative maintenance.
GARDINER: Game days are actually easier for the most part. If we do our job right, the building runs itself.
SPRINGER: But before the games begin again, there’s a lot to do – turn on the water to concession stands, test generators, check emergency lighting, finish the construction in both clubhouses. The punch list goes on and on. And Gardiner’s busy staying on top of it all.
GARDINER: It’s unlike any other building. It’s not Joe’s Pizza. It’s not a high-rise. It’s not a supermarket. It’s a very unique building. And the way it’s used is very unique. And that’s what I love about it. I’d get bored anywhere else.
SPRINGER: Even if that means putting in 100-hour weeks and occasionally sleeping in his office. One thing Donnie Gardiner doesn’t do – watch the Red Sox play. He’s too busy monitoring what’s happening off the field. For NPR News, I’m Shira Springer in Boston.

Juno launched in 2011, took five years to get to Jupiter and has been orbiting that planet since 2016, making occasional flybys like the one this weekend. Steven Levin is a Juno project scientist with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. And we're catching up with him at a conference in Vienna, Austria.
Good morning.
STEVEN LEVIN: Good morning.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: What are you looking for this time in this flyby?
LEVIN: So this particular flyby is actually an unusual one. We're turning sideways. So as we come down the planet from north to south, the spacecraft is rotating so that all the instruments look east to west.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And why is that important?
LEVIN: So that's important because, in particular for the microwave radiometer instrument, by looking across, we'll get a three-dimensional picture so we get a very different view of Jupiter's atmosphere. It's a little tricky because our solar rays are not pointed at the sun for a couple of hours while we do that, so that's why we don't do this all the time. But it'll give us a completely different perspective of Jupiter for that instrument.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And what are you hoping to find? Or do you know?
LEVIN: We're trying to understand Jupiter's atmosphere. We're interested in what it's made out of - how much water there is, how much ammonia there is, what the structure is. And so far, what we've found has been quite a puzzle. It's asymmetric. It's got a feature at the equator that looks different from everything off the equator. We see weather variations.
So now when we look sideways, we'll learn about some of those weather variations. We'll learn about how things might be varying with longitude instead of latitude. We thought Jupiter would be cylindrically symmetric. But Jupiter has surprised us in a lot of ways, and that could be one of them. And then we'll also get - I hope - a really nice 3D map of a strip of Jupiter.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Why is Jupiter so mysterious? And why has it been so difficult to sort of understand what it is like there?
LEVIN: Well, to start with, before the spacecraft got there, Jupiter's a mystery because all we're seeing from Earth is the tops of the clouds. It's this giant planet. We've been studying it for centuries, but you can't see the interior. So when we got there with the spacecraft, we were all prepared to do a lot of measurements to learn about the interior of Jupiter. And basically, every way in which we looked at it threw us a curveball, showed us a surprise.
So we used gravity science. We measured how fast the spacecraft falls to learn about the interior. And we find that the dense core that we expected to find in the center of Jupiter is there, but it's not quite so small. It's larger, and there may be a second one. And we find that the belts and zones that we see go a few thousand kilometers deep. So Jupiter has been a surprise. And basically, we're re-learning the lesson that scientists learn all the time, which is every time you look at something in a new way, you find a surprise.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And why is that important other than just curiosity? I mean, what can Jupiter tell us about Earth?
LEVIN: Jupiter can tell us about the formation of the solar system. You have to remember when you're thinking about this that Jupiter is not just the largest planet in the solar system. It's more than twice the mass of all the others combined, and it formed first. So if you want to understand, how did the planets form? - well, in some sense, they formed as the leftovers from Jupiter. So you really need to understand how Jupiter formed.
But to understand how it's formed, you need to know what it's made out of, in particular, water is really important because it probably formed from icy planetesimals. And you want to know, did they form really cold or closer to the sun than Jupiter is now or further out? But you want to know about the heavy metals as well - the heavier elements that sunk to the center of Jupiter and make its core. So by trying to understand how this one giant planet formed, we can learn a lot about how the whole solar system formed and, of course, about how the Earth formed and where we came from.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Steven Levin, a project scientist with the Juno mission. Thank you so much.

Mueller Report: Understanding Redactions,www.npr.org,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710781515/mueller-report-understanding-redactions,"Lawmakers anxiously await the Mueller report, but there's a catch: redactions. Greg Brower, formerly the FBI's chief liaison to Congress, discusses with Lulu Garcia-Navarro what might be blacked out.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
Attorney General William Barr has promised lawmakers the long-awaited Mueller report, but, of course, there's a catch - redactions. House Democrats and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler wants to see the report without those big blocks of blacked-out text, but Barr wants to remove sensitive information. Greg Brower is the former assistant director for the Office of Congressional Affairs at the FBI. So he's done some redacting, it's safe to say, in his time. And he joins me now in the studio. Welcome.
GREG BROWER: Good morning.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. So what kinds of information would Barr want to redact? And is he obliged to redact it? Or is it really up to him?
BROWER: Well, yes and no. There are four basic categories. The first would be information in the report that might invade the privacy of individuals, perhaps minor players who were really under investigation and who are not public figures. Secondly, there is classified information that is likely to be in the report. That's a more serious matter. But Congress is used to dealing with hearing classified briefings that the public doesn't necessarily get. The third category would be grand jury information that is governed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6. And that's also a complicated matter that is currently a matter of a lot of debate. And then finally, in a very serious and difficult to deal with - a type of information is information relating to ongoing investigations that the Department of Justice may still have ongoing - and that information about cannot be made public.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So as a journalist, I've seen whole documents that were almost totally big, black bars. What's the typical level of redaction for Congress to receive? I mean, are they expected to get the full Mueller report or, you know, or something that might look like you have no idea what's in it?
BROWER: Well, I think in terms of Congress's expectation, I think it's clear they're expecting to see everything. And in fact, there was a recent vote - as you know - in the House of Representatives - 420 to nothing to supporting the full disclosure of the report. But the devil is in the details, of course. Congress is used to, as I said, receiving information in a classified setting, classified briefings. Not every member of Congress typically receives that information. The intelligence committees in both the House and the Senate are used to receiving classified briefings. And then for the highest level of classified information, the so-called Gang of Eight regularly receives briefings of classified information.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: There has been some speculation that Mueller wrote his report with the intention that not a lot of it would have to be redacted, that it was going to be written in a manner so that it could be delivered almost wholesale, at least to Congress. What do you think about that? Do you think that that might be true?
BROWER: I think it might be true. And in fact, if you look to a recent example from 2017, when the intelligence community created a document known as the intelligence community assessment, which was essentially a report on the efforts by the Russian government to interfere in the election, there was a classified version and an unclassified version. And so the idea that Mueller and his team could create a version of its report that is not really going to have to be redacted much is certainly possible.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So if that's the case and if there are redactions - we don't know how many redactions there'll be. But this is a process that is taking a bit of time. So clearly, something is going on. Will that then have to be fought over? I mean, will Congress come back and say, we want to see different portions of this?
BROWER: That is likely to be the case and certainly appears to be shaping up as a fight. I think the toughest part and the part that's been receiving a lot of attention in the last few days is the grand jury information piece of this. That is something that - there is a precedent for grand jury information to be released. That's typically done when the Department of Justice does not object to the release of such information. That was the case in the so-called Haldeman decision in the Watergate era.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Under Nixon?
BROWER: Under Nixon. And that could be the case here if they - if the department decided that it would not object to the release of grand jury information, that would simplify at least that piece of it.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: We only have a few seconds left, but I am going to ask you this question. There is a concern, of course, that Barr's redactions will be politically motivated - there's been a lot of discussion about that - and that they will be aimed at protecting the president. Is that a concern that you share?
BROWER: Well, I - I'd like to not share that concern, frankly. And I implicitly trust the new attorney general to do the right thing in this context. But the March 24 letter that he put out was very confusing. And that has led to a lot of belief that he, perhaps, is acting for political reasons. I'd like to think that's not the case.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Greg Brower, former FBI liaison to Congress. Thanks very much.
BROWER: Thank you.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reversed a controversial policy about children of same-sex couples being baptized. NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro speaks with Jamison Manwaring.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
This past week, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced it will reverse a controversial policy that labeled couples in same-sex marriages apostates, saying they had turned their backs on the church. It also banned their children from being blessed or baptized until they turned 18. Jason (ph) Manwaring is gay, and he grew up in the LDS Church. He took a painful step back from the church after that policy went into effect in 2015. But now he's feeling some relief.
JAMISON MANWARING: Yeah, I was - I'm - was and still am cautiously optimistic about the change. When the policy was put in effect 3 1/2 years ago, it had a very negative impact. But it's good news, right? It doesn't change the pain that was caused for people and the angst and the anxiety in families. But, you know, we want to look forward, and that's how I view it.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: You talked about the policy change in a Facebook video and let's listen.
(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)
MANWARING: This morning's announcement is certainly not an announcement of support for LGBT people, a support - an announcement of support that you should come out and that you should be feel - you should feel welcome being gay at church. It isn't because the church still does not believe that you can be in a gay relationship, a same-sex relationship and be at one with the church policy and essentially at one with God, that that does not work, is not possible.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what other steps do you hope the church will take to fully support the LGBTQ community?
MANWARING: Well, it isn't a place today where I feel comfortable as an out gay man. The teachings that are there from a spiritual level have benefited me a lot throughout my life. But when it comes to this specific issue, even though this is improvement over a policy against gay folks, they're - it is certainly not affirming of gay families. And that's something that, you know, when you think of a 15 or 16-year-old - in fact, I have a nephew who's in high school who has recently come out, and his family was active in their local congregation. It's a very difficult environment for a gay person, young and old, still today to be an active participant in the church.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Leaving the leadership aside, are you finding that the Mormon church community is becoming more receptive to people of the LGBTQ community?
MANWARING: I really do. So my partner and I had been quite involved in my congregation. And when the policy was announced and that really began to sink in and my partner and I were discussing what that meant to us, we had several folks in my neighborhood, in my congregation reached out and and said, you know, we love you being here, and we don't want you to go anywhere. And that is - that's what I miss, quite frankly, is the community of Latter-day Saints who have that sort of love. And I have never personally felt unwelcome as a gay person in my congregation. But the policies that flow from headquarters are a different story.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: The original policy in 2015 prevented the children of those marriages, same-sex marriages, from being blessed or baptized until they turned 18. One of the things that you've always talked about is wanting a family of your own. So how does this change inform your thinking on that now?
MANWARING: Yeah. You know, I - when the policy was announced, it was a challenge for me because I - it clearly said to me that I would not be welcome raising children in the church. And I have - since that time, I've been to many churches, other churches, trying to find a spiritual home for myself and for my future family. And so this doesn't mean that I come back, you know, Sunday with my shirt and tie on ready to re-engage. I'm not ready for that yet. But I want to kind of wait and see, and I'm cautiously hopeful that they will find a way to allow and to support and affirm gay folks - youth, adults and families - in the church.
And I'll speak for myself. I want to be close to God. I want to follow and live a life where I can feel his presence and direction. And if I have a family, I want to be able to have support in doing that from the church community. So I don't think that this change changes everything for me today, but I remain optimistic that as people continue to be open, that that understanding and that that love will increase for people like myself.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was Jamison Manwaring. Thank you very much for being with us.

College Campus Tries Out Robot Delivery,www.npr.org,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710781494/college-campus-tries-out-robot-delivery,"At George Mason University in Northern Virginia, a fleet of autonomous robots roam the sidewalks delivering pizza, doughnuts and coffee to students.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
Delivery robots have been popping up in high-end hotels. Now they are making their way to a younger clientele. Patrick Madden of member station WAMU reports from one university in Northern Virginia.
PATRICK MADDEN, BYLINE: George Mason University looks like any other big college campus - tall buildings, dorms, green grass and wide sidewalks where streams of students make their way to classes, except here on this campus, there's something not so ordinary - robots.
STARSHIP DELIVERY ROBOT: Hello. Here's your delivery.
MADDEN: This is one of several dozen Starship food delivery robots here on campus. Picture a cooler on wheels that resembles R2-D2, if you're a ""Star Wars"" fan. This one was kind enough to bring me doughnuts and coffee.
STARSHIP DELIVERY ROBOT: Thank you. Have a nice day.
MADDEN: For the students at George Mason, these little robots are a trip.
GRACE PERREIRA-PLAZA: I think it's pretty cool and kind of adorable to be honest.
MADDEN: Twenty-year-old student Grace Perreira-Plaza says, at first, students were obsessed with these little bots, taking pictures, selfies, dressing them up for the holidays. Now...
PERREIRA-PLAZA: We find it actually a little bit normal now just seeing them go by. It's like, oh, there they are.
MADDEN: George Mason University says it's the first college in the U.S. to incorporate robots into its student dining plan. The school is partnering with food-service provider Sodexo for the program. It works like this. Instead of, say, walking to the campus Dunkin' Donuts or the Subway sandwich shop, you can place that order from an app, and the robot will bring it to you anywhere on campus. Mark Kraner, head of the school's retail operations, says, when he was first approached about the idea, he couldn't resist.
MARK KRANER: This is going to be a fun ride. We knew the students would just jump all over it.
MADDEN: For the robots, perhaps, the biggest hurdle has been crossing the main road that cuts through campus. But these robots are able to adapt and learn.
KRANER: Working with their algorithms that if they see a student start across the road, they'll be right behind them. So they are learning.
MADDEN: The company behind these robots, Starship Technologies, is planning to roll out these robotic food delivery systems at other schools and corporate campuses. Mark Touhy, an executive at Starship, says the goal of this technology is to save people time.
MARK TOUHY: I think, like most technologies, they'll quickly become taken for granted and just a part of our everyday lives.
MADDEN: And that's basically what happened at George Mason. The college students don't seem to bat an eye when these things scooter along delivering coffee and doughnuts.
STARSHIP DELIVERY ROBOT: I'm a Starship delivery robot.
MADDEN: For the rest of us, it might take some time getting used to. For NPR News, I'm Patrick Madden.

What's Been Learned About Genocide Since Rwanda,www.npr.org,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710781480/whats-been-learned-about-genocide-since-rwanda,"What's Been Learned About Genocide Since Rwanda What's Been Learned About Genocide Since Rwanda Embed Embed
NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro talks with David Simon, who directs the Genocide Studies Program at Yale University, on the 25th anniversary of the start of Rwanda's genocide.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
Over 100 days in 1994, 800,000 people died in Rwanda. The genocide began 25 years ago on today's date - members of the Hutu majority killing minority Tutsis and moderate Hutu en masse. It was a never-again moment for the world. And yet the world has not lived up to that promise. David Simon directs the Genocide Studies Program at Yale. He's in Rwanda now at a memorial conference, and he joins us. Good morning.
DAVID SIMON: Good morning.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: What are you hearing there at the conference? What are they saying at this particular moment?
SIMON: Well, for Rwanda, it's a - a moment like this is a moment to look back and mourn the dead. But when they look back at 1994, they remain, I think, justifiably very angry at the way the world, especially in the form of the United Nations but also the French in particular, let them down. And that still reverberates in 2019.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. Are the lessons of the Rwandan genocide 25 years later different than they were immediately afterward or even a few years afterward? I mean, do we know much more about genocide?
SIMON: Absolutely. I think we do know a lot more. You know, it's easy to say that because genocide persists, we haven't learned the lessons of Rwanda. But the things that we have learned has led to the development of things like early warning systems and national and international institutions. So for example, the Atrocities Prevention Board in the U.S. or the United Nations Office for the Prevention of Genocide did not exist in 1994 and do now in trying to urge people into action.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And so what are the big lessons that we haven't learned?
SIMON: In Rwanda, France's connections to the genocidal regime, in the United States, fear of a Somalia-like quagmire that could have endangered U.S. troops, together led the Security Council to vote actually to pull peacekeepers out of Rwanda after the genocide had started rather than sending more in. So the lesson that we should have learned is that we have to - and those powerful countries in particular - have to privilege human protection over national interests.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And yet we see, at this particular moment in time, isolationism on the rise. We see it in Brexit. We see it here in the United States. Does that make the fight against genocide more difficult?
SIMON: Oh, I think it absolutely does. There's been a lot of progress in the last 25 years, including the creation of their doctrine that's called Responsibility to Protect, which says that the United Nations has a responsibility to protect the people of a country when their own states fail to do so. What happens if that multilateralism falls apart is that we start to question those powers that do intervene. You start to question their motives in those instances where multilateralism falters.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's David Simon, director of Yale's Genocide Studies Program. Thank you very much.

LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
President Trump was at the U.S. southern border again. He continued to advocate for building more wall, kept up his threat to close the border at some point and even talked about levying more tariffs on Mexico.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Trading is very important. The borders are very important. But security is what is most important, and we have to have security.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Joining me now to break this down and discuss the rest of the political news of the day is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.
Good morning, Mara.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. President Trump has backed off his threat to close the border. But at the same time, he did something else that was interesting. He threatened tariffs on Mexico at the same time that his administration is trying to build support for his trade deal that is replacing NAFTA. Doesn't this run counter to one another?
LIASSON: It certainly does. He's threatening tariffs on Mexico if Mexico doesn't do what he wants them to do, which is stop the tide of migrants and drugs at the border. But he just signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement the renegotiated NAFTA, which says you can't do that. You can't put tariffs on Canada or Mexico. And this is what Trump said about that.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: This will supersede USMCA. USMCA's a great deal, and it's very good for Mexico. But this will supersede USMCA.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So that's the United-States-Mexico-Canada agreement. Why is he doing this?
LIASSON: Well, USMCA certainly is a huge accomplishment for him. He's talked about it that way. But it shows that he loves tariffs. He said, I'm a tariff man. Of course, that raises the question, why sign a free trade agreement that prohibits tariffs if you like them so much? - but also the more important issue that immigration and appealing to xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment is a signature issue for Trump. He thinks it's very important to his base. He used it in 2016. He'll use it again in 2020. That's why he was in Calexico, Mexico, this past Friday, saying this.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: The system is full - can't take you anymore, whether it's asylum, whether it's anything you want. It's illegal immigration - can't take you anymore. We can't take you. Our country is full.
LIASSON: Of course, that's not true. The U.S. is facing a looming labor shortage. And it goes against the entire idea of America, which was built on immigration. The president has even mocked asylum-seekers, suggesting that he doesn't believe anyone could be fleeing for their lives from Central America. As far as he's concerned, asylum is a kind of scam.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Switching gears, I want to talk about former Vice President Biden. He's having his own #MeToo moment. President Trump was relatively restrained about it at first. But that did not last long.
LIASSON: No, it didn't. At first, he waved off questions, saying that he didn't really want to answer the questions about Biden. That lasted about a day or two. Then he retweeted a video from a pro-Trump PAC that doctored Biden's apology video, showed Biden popping up in the background - cartoonish head putting his hands on the real Biden's shoulders. And so he has waded into a new chapter with a new enemy and foil, somebody he wants to denigrate and make fun of.
Biden, for the first time, got into the Twitter wars, tweeted in response to that, quote, ""I see you are on the job and presidential as always."" So as we know, Biden is widely expected to get into the race later this month, probably after Easter. We know how the pundit class and the Twitterverse (ph) responded to his #MeToo moment. They don't think he's handled it very well. What we don't know is what Democratic voters are going to think about Biden.

Shelters And City Governments Scramble To Help Migrants In The Rio Grande Valley,www.npr.org,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710366095/shelters-and-city-governments-scramble-to-help-migrants-in-the-rio-grande-valley,"Good Neighbor Settlement House in Brownsville, Texas, is helping recently released migrants by offering them a meal, shower and some new clothes before journeying up north to await their day in immigration court.

Eric Gay/AP
More than 76,000 people were apprehended or surrendered on the Southern border in February and administration officials project that number would surpass 100,000 for March.
The highest number of crossings are taking place in Texas' Rio Grande Valley.
The Good Neighbor Settlement House, a homeless shelter in Brownsville, Texas, is now also being used to house migrants released from U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody. They normally help a couple dozen migrants a day, but recently the numbers shot up to more than 400 a day.
We don't intend to back off of the mission we embrace. They can keep sending them, we're going to serve them. Jack White, director, Good Neighbor Settlement House
The migrants are brought here for a short period of time and can shower, eat and get some clean clothes. Volunteers help migrants work out travel arrangements so they can meet up with relatives or sponsors in other parts of the country while they await their day in immigration court.
All along the Texas border, cities are dealing with an unprecedented influx of migrants.

The shelter started their Refugee Respite Program in August at the request of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley. Jack White, the director of Good Neighbor, says he's recently seen a spike in numbers and they are no longer receiving advance notice from CBP when migrants are being released.
Still, White says, they're dealing with it.
""Will it be hard?"" asked White. ""Yes, but we don't intend to back off of the mission we embrace. They can keep sending them, we're going to serve them.""
Migrants usually arrive at the shelter with some documentation about relatives or sponsors to contact to arrange shelter while they await their immigration court proceedings — that wait can take months, even years, because of the huge backlog of cases.
But Marianela Ramirez-Watson, the director for the Refugee Respite Program, says last weekend they ran into a new problem.
""A group of people showed up without their paperwork and so the minute we caught it we called CBP and they said, 'Oh my gosh, they weren't supposed to send that bus yet,' "" said Ramirez-Watson. ""Some confusion when you're dealing with as many people as they are.""
While local organizations, like Good Neighbor, handle the releases, the Trump administration continues to call on Congress to change immigration laws to stave off what they consider a national emergency at the border.
But César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández says the real crisis isn't with people asking for asylum, it's with the immigration system itself.
García Hernández is an associate professor of law at the University of Denver and a Rio Grande Valley native. He said it's important to point out that this administration has already made some changes in an effort to limit the number of asylum-seekers.
""[In the past] a person could make a claim, a successful claim for asylum based on abuse by a violent spouse. Or because of violence being inflicted by the gangs that are destabilizing much of Central America,"" said García Hernández. ""The Trump administration has made it almost impossible to make those claims.""
Still, the asylum-seekers keep coming.
As Good Neighbor braces for more, Brownsville's mayor, Tony Martinez, said his city has adapted to the challenge pretty well. Martinez said CBP said to expect nearly 6,000 migrants across the Rio Grande Valley this week.
""I've been in situations where there is no way to control something, whether it's a health problem, or otherwise, and you really feel helpless and overwhelmed and you're at your wits' ends,"" said Martinez. ""Here, because of the community coming together, we lift each other's heart to meet the occasion.""
Meanwhile, CBP announced Thursday that construction of 13 miles of new border wall in the Rio Grande Valley will begin this month."

Little Green Eyes/Courtesy of the artist Jackson Stell began his music career making hip-hop beats. As a producer, he had gone by J Beatz. Then some years ago, he felt stuck and had a change of heart. He decided to make a different type of music and he decided he would try his hand at singing on his tracks. Now, this beatsmith-turned-vocalist is known as Big Wild and says singing and writing lyrics enabled him to make music that feels true to himself.
Superdream, the debut album of Big Wild, is a collection of funky, electronic dance jams that features his own voice for the first time. Stell says his singing still comes as a surprise to his own his family members.
Heavy Rotation Kehlani, Royal Canoe, Big Wild And More: 10 Songs Public Radio Can't Stop Playing ""They are still trying to wrap their heads around the fact that I am singing, because growing up I never sang,"" Stell explains. ""I, for the most part, have been a really quiet person, but especially with music, I was all about production.""
Stell was inspired to change his musical course and stage moniker to Big Wild about five years ago when the artist visited California. ""It was kind of at a moment in my life where I was making a big change and I just wanted to embody that spirit of adventurousness of being curious,"" he says.
YouTube This switch paid off. His collaboration with Tove Styrke, "" Aftergold "" became a hit. In 2017, Stell released his first EP, Invincible, gaining millions of plays. The musician carried that adventurous spirit into Superdream, a collection of songs deeply rooted in his life. Stell wrote the song ""Maker"" after receiving a thyroid cancer diagnosis five years ago, going through multiple surgeries and gaining a whole new perspective on what music he wanted to make.
""It was important for me to write about struggles and challenges I've had, but offer or put a positive focus on it,"" Stell says.

Noah Fortson/NPR It was the morning after the election of America's first black president, and Kwame Onwuachi was hungover. He'd been partying all night. He was dealing drugs to survive after he dropped out of college. He was, he says, lost.
But when he saw President Obama, something clicked. ""I thought, I can do anything. And I immediately flushed everything that I had down the toilet and was like, I need to find myself,"" Onwuachi recalls.
He went to the grocery store and bought ingredients to cook a chicken curry. ""I didn't know that I wanted to cook, but it was like, here's something that I'm familiar with,"" he says. ""Here's something that brings back these fond memories. And here's something that grounds me. And I want to explore this a little bit more.""
These days, Onwuachi is a rising star in the food world — the executive chef at Kith and Kin , a celebrated Afro-Caribbean restaurant in Washington, D.C., and a nominee this year for a prestigious James Beard award.

Amazon Independent Booksellers His road to the rarefied world of fine cuisine has had many fits and starts, which he details in a new memoir, Notes From A Young Black Chef. Eventually, there would be a stint on Top Chef, work in the best restaurants in America, the opening of his first place in D.C. — and its rapid and painful closure. But that road began in a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx, where he grew up with his mother and sister.
""My mother was an accountant and she wanted to figure out a way to spend time with us while still taking care of the bills,"" Onwuachi says. ""So she started a catering company from the house, and me and my sister became her first two employees.""
Times were hard. ""There were a lot of times where we didn't have lights,"" he says, ""and my mother made up a game called Lights Out, where we all slept in the living room together and put candles everywhere. She shielded me with love, instead of revealing to me the harsh realities that were going on.""
Onwuachi's life story is written in his recipes. His mother's family hails from Louisiana and Trinidad. Creole and Caribbean flavors infuse his cooking. On his father's side, there are roots in Jamaica and Nigeria, where Onwuachi spent two years as a tween.

Noah Fortson/NPR ""I was definitely veering off on the wrong path as a kid growing up in the South Bronx,"" he says. So his mother sent him to live with his father's relatives in Nigeria. ""I spent a couple of years there, learning about my culture, my ancestors' traditions that I wasn't familiar with. And then inherently, I also learned a lot about cooking.""
In Nigeria, he says, ""if you wanted 20 wings, you had to raise 10 chickens. You saw where the food came from.""
He took all that experience into the high temples of American cuisine – first, Per Se, and then Eleven Madison Park , both in New York City. He says he wanted to learn from the best.
""It was and still is an amazing restaurant,"" he says of the highly acclaimed Per Se. ""The food that they produce, the level of attention to detail that goes into every single aspect — whether it's the receiving of produce to putting that said produce through a process of fabrication, the cookery and then onto the plate. It's a symphony.""
But Onwuachi's memoir is not a simple story about triumph in the face of poverty and struggle. It's also a meditation on what goes on behind that perfect façade --- what it is like to be a black man in this rarefied world. He tells the story of alerting the head chef to a word that has a double meaning as a racist slur that was being used on the menu. He was told not to worry about it because ""black people don't eat here.""

Noah Fortson/NPR ""These jokes happen more than you think,"" Onwuachi says. ""We get looked over [for advancement] more than you think. And it's not the direct racism. ... it's the unspoken racism that's hurtful.""
So Onwauchi left to open his own restaurant. He was only 26, and people kept telling him he had not paid his dues. When his first D.C. venture, Shaw Bijou, closed in under three months in a highly publicized failure , people seemed almost gleeful.
""It infuriated me at the time,"" Onwuachi says. ""People telling you that you haven't paid your dues — what are you talking? I've been afforded an opportunity. Who in their right mind is going to say, 'Thank you for this million-dollar offer, but I need to go and pay my dues a little bit more and then I'll call you back if you're still interested'?""
These days, Onwuachi is earning rave reviews for his new restaurant, Kith and Kin. And he wants people to think about why critics and customers deem only certain cuisines – Italian, French, Japanese — worthy of the name fine dining.
The Salt Why Hunting Down 'Authentic Ethnic Food' Is A Loaded Proposition ""You don't have Southeast Asian there. You don't have Caribbean [food], or all of the [African] diaspora, which is like 54 different countries. You know, one of them's got to have a food that you can respect at a high level, right?""
To change minds, he says, ""I think it's going to take a lot more chefs of color to introduce these this type of cuisine to people at a high level.""
The Salt Cheap Eats, Cheap Labor: The Hidden Human Costs Of Those Lists Onwuachi sees his own culinary repertoire as a counter to these food world stereotypes. While his food encompasses a range of African, Caribbean, African-American and other influences, one cuisine he doesn't do is what some diners might expect of a young black chef: soul food.
""My roots are not fried chicken and mac and cheese and collard greens,"" he says. ""I mean, that's part of it. But when I have family reunions, we don't cook that food. We cook gumbo and shrimp. So those are the things that resonate with me. But also, I'm a black chef. So the food that I cook is black.""
""I don't need to be pigeonholed into soul food or even Creole food or even just Caribbean food or West African food. I'm a culmination of many different cultures, and the ideas that I have are because of that."""

Sara Stathas for NPR George Berzsenyi is a retired math professor living in Milwaukee County. Most people have never heard of him.
But Berzsenyi has had a remarkable impact on American science and mathematics. He has mentored thousands of high school students, including some who became among the best mathematicians and scientists in the country.
I learned about Berzsenyi from a chance conversation with a scientist named Vamsi Mootha .
In the late 1980s, when Mootha was in high school in Beaumont, Texas, he won a science fair. A few days later, a letter arrived in the mail.
""It said, 'Dear Vamsi, Congratulations on winning the Houston Science Fair , this is quite the accomplishment,' "" Mootha recalls.
""But then when I started reading the next paragraph, I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach,"" Mootha says.
The letter went on to say that the math problem young Vamsi solved to win the fair had been solved hundreds of years earlier.
""Of course, the letter went on, 'You can't be expected to know this because you're only a sophomore in high school, and perhaps you haven't had the appropriate mentorship ... If you're interested in solving original problems, why don't you write back to me.' ""
The letter was signed ""George Berzsenyi."" At the time, Berzsenyi was a math professor at Lamar University in Beaumont.
Mootha says the letter upset him because he thought he had discovered something new.
But then he became intrigued. ""I said, 'You know what, I'm going to take him up on his offer and write back to him.' ""
They got together and the older mathematician and the young prodigy hit it off. Berzsenyi would give Mootha those original problems to solve ... and an appreciation for mathematics.
""He also sort of instilled in me a love for mathematics and a love for sort of elegant mathematics that makes sense,"" Mootha says

Courtesy of George Berzsenyi Eventually Mootha headed off to Stanford University, then Harvard medical school where he works today.
A half-dozen or so years ago, Mootha found out he had a lot of company in being mentored by George Berzsenyi.
""I share an office with somebody named Joel Hirschhorn ,"" Mootha tells me. Hirschhorn is a geneticist at Harvard and the Broad Institute. Mootha and Hirschhorn were trying to solve a math problem related to their work.
""Joel is up at the board, he's drawing out some equations,"" Mootha recalls. ""After we worked on the problem, we're just reminiscing about our high school days in mathematics.
""So I start to tell Joel about how I got this letter after winning a science fair,"" Mootha says, ""and before I could actually finish that sentence, he actually asked me, 'Wait. Did that letter come from somebody named George Berzsenyi?' And I said, 'Yes, how do you know?' And he said, 'I used to communicate with George Berzsenyi also.' ""
Hirschhorn would send in solutions to problems in a math newsletter Berzsenyi edited.

Sara Stathas for NPR The coincidence was astonishing, and then it happened again.
Two weeks later, Mootha is telling Sebastian Seung this story. Seung is a neuroscientist who at the time was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Before he can finish the story, Mootha says, ""Sebastian interrupts me and says, 'Wait, was that George Berzsenyi?' and I said, 'Yes, how do you know?' ""
Mootha soon found that Berzsenyi has affected the lives of many top scientists and mathematicians.
At this point, I knew I had to meet Berzsenyi. So I went to meet him at his house in Milwaukee County where he lives with his wife, Kay.
Berzsenyi is 80 now. He was born in Hungary. In high school, he fell in love with mathematics. Hungary punches above its weight in the subject. The country has produced many famous mathematicians.
Berzsenyi came to America and got a doctorate in mathematics.
He joined the math faculty at Lamar in Beaumont, where he started mentoring talented high school math students.
He created a math magazine patterned on KöMaL , which he had read in Hungary while in high school. The magazine only existed for a few years. He's hoping someday someone will revive it.
There were tricky math problems in the magazine. When students sent in solutions, he would send back comments.
He was surprised how willing the students were to work with him. He realized he was filling an unmet need. Berzsenyi said most high schools don't have the expertise to help these bright math students, and professional mathematicians by and large can't be bothered.
Berzsenyi loved watching young people's math talents grow.

Courtesy of George Berzsenyi ""In spite of their youth, I considered them mathematically supremely mature and treated them in such fashion ... I really admired them,"" he says.
Over the years, Berzsenyi worked with thousands of kids. He didn't expect all of them to become mathematicians. In addition to math, Berzsenyi's protégés have gone on to biology, business and even law.

""I first met Dr. Berzsenyi through the young scholars programs in 1995,"" says Yvonne Lai , an assistant math professor the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. She says Berzsenyi created the program as kind of a summer math camp for high school students.
As the camp was coming to an end, Lai recalls, ""He assigned us a group of 10 math competition-style problems that we could hand in as a final assignment in 10 years.""
The group stayed in touch using a mailing list. And about a decade later, ""somebody wrote the mailing list and said, 'It's been 10 years, we have a problem set due,' "" Lai says with a laugh.
An assignment due 10 years later is just the kind of clever idea George Berzsenyi used to keep students engaged in math.
Berzsenyi is proud of what his math protégés have accomplished. Ferrell Wheeler does cryptography work for the National Security Agency. Kiran Kedlaya works on number theory at the University of California, San Diego. Noam Elkies became a tenured math faculty member at Harvard when he was just 26 years old.
The protégés are uniformly grateful for Berzsenyi's attention.
It is ""through programs that George Berzsenyi developed that I think I got the courage to become a math major,"" says Lai.
""His influence on me is hard to describe,"" says Wheeler. ""He was like a second father to me. And he helped me immensely.""
""It's hard to find somebody who is that passionate about discovering the future generation of talent in any field, but particularly in mathematics,"" says Kedlaya.
Of all the students Berzsenyi told me about in the hours we spoke, one stood out: Jimmy Wilson. ""In the long run, Jimmy was probably my major discovery,"" Berzsenyi says.
Wilson almost fell through the cracks. When he was a high school freshman, Wilson took part in a math competition. Berzsenyi happened to look over the shoulder of the judge scoring Wilson's solution to one of the tough problems in the competition.
""The solution he gave to the problem was a perfect solution,"" Berzsenyi says. ""Somehow, the person who was grading the solution didn't recognize that it actually solved the problem, and very elegantly.""
So Berzsenyi overruled the first judge and gave Wilson a top score.

Courtesy of George Berzsenyi Later in high school, Berzseny took Wilson and a bunch of other students to a math competition on the East Coast.
The concluding event at the competition was a game called Buzz.
""The kid never heard of this before. I never heard of it before,"" Berzsenyi says.
It's a counting game. Students stand in a circle and take turns counting, but there are complex rules where you replace numbers with words like ""buzz,"" ""bang"" or ""whack."" Say the wrong word and you're out. It's fiendishly hard to keep all the rules straight, especially as the count reaches into the hundreds.
Eventually, there were just two students left: the previous year's champion and Wilson.
""It was just unbelievable to watch,"" Berzsenyi recalls. ""Very methodically, Jimmy just succeeded where the other kid didn't.""

Meredith Rizzo/NPR For all his natural aptitude for math, at first Wilson didn't do well in college. He dropped out of Texas A&M. Berzsenyi says it was because Wilson hadn't really learned how to study.
""At that time, I didn't recognize some of the things I should have been doing,"" he says. ""I still feel bad about it.""
""I don't think he needs to feel that way at all,"" says Jimmy Wilson. Today he goes by Jim Wilson. He now has his college degree. He still lives in Beaumont, Texas. He has worked as an educator in the local school system for most of his adult life.
He's proud of what he did at that East Coast math competition, proud of his math skills. He's especially proud of the day George Berzsenyi gave him a Rubik's Cube.
"" 'If you can solve it, you can keep it,' "" Wilson recalls Berzsenyi saying.
He solved it in short order.
Wilson recalled Berzsenyi telling him how impressed he was: "" 'Oh, by the way, I think you're the first person in the country to solve it.' "" The cube Berzsenyi gave Wilson was one he had brought back from Hungary, where the Rubik's Cube was invented. The U.S. version had yet to go on the market — it did so in 1980.
It's true Wilson didn't achieve the kind of academic fame or financial success that some of Berzsenyi's other students did.
""I could look back with some regrets,"" Wilson says. But he has also found great fulfillment in helping the students he has taught over the years to find the joy in math.
""To this day, as I reach out to help students to improve their skills, it's because of that relationship that started when I was in high school with Dr. Berzsenyi,"" Wilson says.

Blake Farmer/WPLN When a rural community loses its hospital, health care becomes harder to come by in an instant. But a hospital closure also shocks a small town's economy. It shuts down one of its largest employers. It scares off heavy industry that needs an emergency room nearby. And in one Tennessee town, a lost hospital means lost hope of attracting more retirees.
Seniors, and their retirement accounts, have been viewed as potential saviors for many rural economies trying to make up for lost jobs. But the epidemic of rural hospital closures is threatening those dreams in places like Celina, Tenn.. The town of 1,500, whose 25-bed hospital closed March 1, has been trying to position itself as a retiree destination.
Shots - Health News Rethinking Rural Health Solutions To Save Patients And Communities ""I'd say, look elsewhere,"" says Susan Scovel, a Seattle transplant who came with her husband in 2015.
Scovel's despondence is especially noteworthy given that she leads the local chamber of commerce effort to attract retirees like herself. She considers the wooded hills and secluded lake to hold comparable scenic beauty to the Washington coast — with dramatically lower costs of living; she and a small committee plan getaway weekends for prospects to visit.
When she first toured the region before moving in 2015, Scovel and her husband, who had Parkinson's, made sure to scope out the hospital, on a hill overlooking the sleepy town square. And she's rushed to the hospital four times since he died in 2017.
""I have very high blood pressure, and they're able to do the IVs to get it down,"" Scovel says. ""This is an anxiety thing since my husband died. So now — I don't know.""
She says she can't in good conscience advise a senior with health problems to come join her in Celina.

Blake Farmer/WPLN The closure adds delays when seconds count
Celina's Cumberland River Hospital had been on life support for years, operated by the city-owned medical center an hour away in Cookeville, which decided in late January to cut its losses after trying to find a buyer. Cookeville Regional Medical Center explains that the facility faced the grim reality for many rural providers.
""Unfortunately, many rural hospitals across the country are having a difficult time and facing the same challenges, like declining reimbursements and lower patient volumes, that Cumberland River Hospital has experienced,"" CEO Paul Korth said in a written statement.
Shots - Health News Vulnerable Rural Hospitals Face Tough Decisions On Questionable Billing Schemes Celina became the 11th rural hospital in Tennessee to close in recent years — more than in any state but Texas. Both states have refused to expand Medicaid in a way that covers more of the working poor. Even some Republicans now say the decision to not expand Medicaid has added to the struggles of rural health care providers.
The closest hospital is now 18 miles away. That adds another 30 minutes through mountain roads for those who need an X-ray or blood work. For those in the back of an ambulance, that bit of time could make the difference between life or death.

Blake Farmer/WPLN ""We have the capability of doing a lot of advanced life support, but we're not a hospital,"" says emergency management director Natalie Boone.
The area is already limited in its ambulance service, with two of its four trucks out of service.
Once a crew is dispatched, Boone says, it's committed to that call. Adding an hour to the turnaround time means someone else could likely call with an emergency and be told — essentially — to wait in line.
""What happens when you have that patient that doesn't have that extra time?"" Boone asks. ""I can think of at least a minimum of two patients [in the last month] that did not have that time.""
Residents are bracing for cascading effects. Susan Bailey hasn't retired yet, but she's close. She's spent nearly 40 years as a registered nurse, including her early career at Cumberland River.
""People say, 'You probably just need to move or find another place to go,' "" she says.

Blake Farmer/WPLN Bailey and others are concerned that losing the hospital will soon mean losing the only three physicians in town. The doctors say they plan to keep their practices going, but for how long? And what about when they retire?
""That's a big problem,"" Bailey says. ""The doctors aren't going to want to come in and open an office and have to drive 20 or 30 minutes to see their patients every single day.""

Some employees come to tears at the prospect of having to find work outside the county and are deeply sad that their hometown is losing one of its largest employers — second only to the local school system.
Dr. John McMichen is an emergency physician who would travel to Celina to work weekends at the ER and give the local doctors a break.

""It reminded me of a time long ago that has seemingly passed. I can't say that it will ever come back,"" he says. ""I have hopes that there's still some hope for small hospitals in that type of community. But I think the chances are becoming less of those community hospitals surviving."""
"Book Review: 'The Old Drift,' By Namwali Serpell : NPR",www.npr.org,Annalisa Quinn,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710315354/the-old-drift-takes-the-long-view-of-human-and-mosquito-history,"Namwali Serpell On 'The Old Drift'
To err also means to wander, and The Old Drift does, shamelessly: It does not acknowledge restraints of species or time or perspective or taste or page length (568). Like a mosquito swarm, the narrative hovers, drifts, and returns elliptically to the same places again and again. Serpell will use, for instance, three different metaphors in a row to describe the night sky: ""The scroll of the night unrolled, flat as it ever was, its uneven Braille twinkling down. The black sack scattered its loot of light back across the universe again. And the vast night tree under which we all stand bloomed with pale blossoms once more.""
Serpell's style is florid, but the excess often comes with a point. These are indeed three ways humans think about space: As something legible and predictive, as a resource to exploit, and as a source of beauty and awe. You also get the sense that the descriptive excess is a conscious choice; as one character says, ""[W]hat ruined this country was efficiency — the British worship of efficiency."" And while she is sweeping in scope and gesture, she can also be precise, especially about smells and sounds: ""[h]is pulse ticked faintly, erratically, like cooling metal,"" a woman ""let out a languorous ululation like a glugging drain,"" stones of a gravel drive ""gurgled affably"" under the wheels of a car.
Serpell's style is florid, but the excess often comes with a point.
Serpell also performs exquisite acts of literary ventriloquism (in addition to scattered allusions from Shakespeare to Milton to Lucretius to Virgil). The final chapter is a close reworking of the opening of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness , and the first chapter is written in the pitch-perfect voice of a jolly, cruel British colonist: ""The worst difficulty of exploration, I learned, is that it is a tormenting isolation. There was no chumming it up with the blacks, naturally.""
In the final chapters, three young people, descendants of the three family lines traced in The Old Drift , mount a revolution by hacking the Beads and using the mosquitoes' robotic twins, tiny solar-powered drones, to mount an attack on a system of oppression in place since the founding of Zambia. ""Power's just an accident that depends on the weakness of others,"" says one of the revolutionaries. ""They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what they could get."" These chapters have a wonderful, apocalyptic finality, with floods and flames, speeches and sacrifice.
The Old Drift offers a view of human history characterized by generative mistakes, from Dr Livingstone's fatal calculation about the source of the Nile to evolution itself: ""Don't forget evolution forged the entirety of life using only one tool: the mistake ..."" To err is human, we hear again and again. But the second half of that maxim, the part about forgiveness, isn't mentioned. You get the sense it might be beside the point to Serpell's youngest generation of characters, with their scalding assessments of injustice and cruelty by those in power. They're not here to forgive. They're here for the revolution. Facebook"
Netanyahu Vows He Will Annex Israeli Settlements In West Bank If Re-Elected : NPR,www.npr.org,Francesca Paris,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710799152/ahead-of-israeli-election-netanyahu-pledges-to-annex-west-bank-settlements,"Enlarge this image People walk by election campaign billboards showing Israeli Prime Minister and head of the Likud party Benjamin Netanyahu (left) alongside the Blue and White party leaders, including Benny Gantz.

Ahead of Tuesday's election, Netanyahu has pledged to annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Oded Balilty/AP Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that he will annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank if he is re-elected.
Netanyahu staked out the position on television on Saturday, ahead of Tuesday's election where he faces a challenge from his former army chief of staff Benny Gantz
The first-time move from the prime minister appears to be aimed at galvanizing support among his nationalist base and right-wing political allies. The annexation of parts of the West Bank would likely be considered the final blow to the possibility of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Netanyahu was asked on Israeli Channel 12 TV why he hasn't annexed Israeli settlement blocs in occupied territory, as NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Jerusalem.
The prime minister replied: ""Will we go to the next phase? The answer is yes. We will go to the next phase to extend Israeli sovereignty.""
""I will impose sovereignty, but I will not distinguish between settlement blocs and isolated settlements,"" he continued, The Associated Press reports. ""From my perspective, any point of settlement is Israeli, and we have responsibility, as the Israeli government. I will not uproot anyone, and I will not transfer sovereignty to the Palestinians.""
World Here's What To Know About Israel's Upcoming Elections On Sunday, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki responded to that pledge and accused the U.S. of encouraging Netanyahu.
""If Netanyahu wants to declare Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, then you know he has to face a real problem, the presence of 4.5 million Palestinians, what to do with them,"" Malki told the AP while attending the World Economic forum in Jordan, apparently citing the combined total of Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.
He said Israel cannot expel the Palestinians, adding, ""The international community has to deal with us.""
Netanyahu has actively supported the growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since the Six-Day War in 1967. But Israel has so far stopped short of formally annexing the West Bank, leaving the door open for further negotiations with Palestinians.
Some 400,000 Israeli settlers and 2.8 million Palestinians now live in in the West Bank .
The Israeli settlements – which include large subdivisions and cities full of middle-class villas – have long complicated efforts for a two-state solution: Palestinians have said the settlements would make it impossible to create a viable state in the West Bank, as NPR's Greg Myre has reported .

"Questions For Arkady Martine, Author Of 'A Memory Called Empire' : NPR",www.npr.org,Arkady Martine,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710356506/questions-for-arkady-martine-author-of-a-memory-called-empire,"Questions For Arkady Martine, Author Of 'A Memory Called Empire' Facebook Independent Booksellers
Before she was a novelist (and occasional NPR contributor), Arkady Martine was a Byzantine historian and an apprentice city planner — and that expertise is on display in her new book A Memory Called Empire . It's the story of an ambassador from a small, independent space station on the edge of a huge, devouring galactic empire, who arrives in the imperial capital and is almost immediately launched on a wild ride of intrigue, courtly manners, poetry and plotting.
Martine's Teixcalaanli Empire has overtones of Byzantium and the Aztecs, among other cultures. ""I wanted to think about empires that were conquest-oriented, that were war-and-sacrifice oriented, and that led me to the Mexica — the Triple Alliance of the Aztecs,"" she tells me in an email conversation. ""The world of Teixcalaan isn't Byzantium, and it isn't the Mexica, and it isn't any of the other cultures I added in, but I wanted to look outside of what I knew best, see what other imperial structures with a universalizing we-are-the-center-of-the-world ideology could add to my conceptions of empire and its functions. And also I wanted to pull away from the elements of Christian theology which are deeply embedded into Byzantine imperialism, and one of the ways I did that was to design a religion that was based on blood sacrifice (though, in the period of this book, Teixcalaan is a long way away from any actual human sacrifice practices, though they're drifting around in the background.)""
What other cultures are in the mix? The way the Teixcalaanli treat outsiders seems like it has some real world resonances.
Some Mongol steppe empire, certainly — the Emperor's Sworn Band concept is straight from Central Asian modes of political governance — but more importantly, there's a lot of American cultural imperialism in how Teixcalaan spreads itself across the galaxy. It's not just a military power — it's a pervasive cultural one. Unavoidable, like McDonald's and Hollywood movies.
And my development of the civilized vs. barbarian concept that Teixcalaan is based on is from Rome, and Byzantium (which is still Rome, according to Byzantines). But it is also the experience of many, many people right now, who either choose or are forced into assimilation into a larger, more dominant and oppressive culture — and how that assimilation is never total, always conditional, never complete.
I'm an American Jew. It's a story-concept that spoke to me very personally.
Poetry plays a huge role in the empire's cultural and political life — what inspired that? And what was it like trying to write poetry in English that had to reflect poetry written in Teixcalaanli?
... there's a lot of American cultural imperialism in how Teixcalaan spreads itself across the galaxy. It's not just a military power — it's a pervasive cultural one. Unavoidable, like McDonald's and Hollywood movies. Arkady Martine
A great deal of the plot of A Memory Called Empire moves through the speaking of, transmission of, and use/reuse of poetic form: there's a poetry contest that prefigures a war, for example, and a protest song which first incites a riot and then is used to calm it down. Poetry is capable of all these things; I am not instilling it with any special quality that it lacks in the world we live in. Anglophone Western culture of the 21st century has mostly relegated the political power of poetry to in-group settings: the open mic, the protest rally. But poetry has a political valence which is widely recognized elsewhere, both currently and historically. And I really wanted to use that — to think about poetry as emotional carrier wave for politics, philosophy, ideology. Also, it's a pretty direct lift from Middle Byzantine literary culture: Teixcalaan, like Byzantium, has a literature that centers poetic forms in part because their literature is one which is performed out loud in political settings. Oratorical verse, with rhythm and meter, is a valued skill set amongst the intelligentsia. (The poetry contests in A Memory Called Empire are a little bit like rap battles with politics in. Think of the Cabinet Battle songs in Hamilton and you've got the idea pretty much solid.)
I wrote three full poems and many partial ones for the book, including two versions of the same protest song, a political intervention in the form of a three-line epigram, and a public safety message that used to be part of an epic about city-building. Teixcalaanli poetry is explicitly supposed to be in complex meter, and sometimes also in complex rhyme — this is that skillset use again — but I deliberately ignored that when I wrote the poetry for the book, because, well — writing in English meter wouldn't match up with what the Teixcalaanli meter would be. And also I'm terrible at metered poetry. I can fake being a genius political poet in free verse, but all my attempts at metered poetry come out twee as hell. The choice to gesture at poetry instead of trying to achieve the heights of the form let me not get trapped in having to be really, really good. It's a shortcut. But I wanted readers to think that Teixcalaanli poets were incredible, whether or not that particular reader liked English poetry — so I didn't want to trip them up with English poetry poorly done, or which might ring false or silly and throw them out of the story.
You're also a city planner — tell me how that played into the way you designed the City and its AI.
The poetry contests in 'A Memory Called Empire' are a little bit like rap battles with politics in. Think of the Cabinet Battle songs in 'Hamilton' and you've got the idea pretty much solid. Arkady Martine
Urban planning is a long history of cities (and their planners) seeing, and deliberately not seeing, the people who live in them. Working in city planning makes me consider the city as an organism, as a machine for living in (to deliberately misquote Le Corbusier ). And that is reflected in the City which is the Jewel of the World in A Memory Called Empire. The City — the Jewel of the World, the heart of Teixcalaan — is an oecumenopolis , a world-city: essentially a planet which has been fully urbanized aside from its oceans and its natural reserves. City-planets are quintessentially space opera for me — Star Wars ' Coruscant, for example, but also any number of others. I love the visual of the idea. All that architecture, a planet that would glow like a jewel, lit up with glass and metal and lights. But cities aren't just visuals, they're real, complex, messy places, and a planet-size city would be complex to the point of near-ungovernability.
Which of course is where the algorithm-driven subway system and other city-ruling algorithms and artificial intelligences that I created for the Jewel of the World come in. If you have something so complex as a world-city, it would require artificial intelligence to keep tabs on, most likely. And algorithmic processes, to help predict what its needs are. And because I study history, and because I work in city planning, I knew when I began thinking about those algorithms that they were going to be biased, be about panopticon control, be about making citizens of Teixcalaan visible to policing and governing forces, and making non-citizens either invisible or singled out for persecution. Because that's what algorithms tend to do, because algorithms are written by human beings.
I'm a worldbuilding nerd and I love the tiny details that make a setting pop ... like those Teixcalaanli names! (They reminded me of reading National Geographic stories about excavations at Rio Azul when I was little) How did you come up with them?
I actually got Tor to put up a version of my (terrifyingly extensive) document about How Teixcalaanli Names Work, over here.
But the real inspiration for the number-noun naming system comes from the naming practices of the Mixtec people of Oaxaca, who, like many Mesoamerican peoples, were named for the day in the 260-day cycle of the year on which they were born: a cycle of thirteen numbers and twenty signs (animals, plants, and natural phenomena). Teixcalaan has a lot of Mesoamerican influences, and choosing to use this kind of name felt like it really deepened and specified the cultures I was referencing.
Am I going to a special literary hell because my brain kept rendering the Emperor's name as One Direction?
Yes, you are going to a special literary hell, but you won't be alone there. I realized fairly early on that Emperor Six Direction was, er, Reminiscent of a certain band. And yet I couldn't bring myself to change it, because it's such a perfect name for a Teixcalaanli emperor: All six of their directions! North, south, east, west, earth, sky. Emperor of everything, stretching out in all directions!
On the other hand, my friend Max Gladstone and I ended up giving all the One Direction boys Teixcalaanli names as a kind of preemptive self-defense, so I am not sure whether I regret or am gleeful about my choices here.
Editor's note: For the record, Martine says Harry actually IS named One Direction in Teixcalaanli. Zayn is One Amaryllis, Niall is One Lathe, Louis is One Silicon — or maybe Semiconductor — and Liam is One Expanding Insulation Foam. She also says you can consider this canon.
Will there be more stories set in this world? I want to know what Three Seagrass does next. Or what the deal with the scary ring-ships is.
Yes, there absolutely will be! The direct sequel (which will tell you both about the scary ring-ships and what Three Seagrass does next) is titled A Desolation Called Peace , which I thoroughly stole from Tacitus. (I was reading Tacitus in a bar in Prague, long story. But it's the best line. Rome makes a desert and calls it peace.) The book itself is about incomprehensibility and impossible wars. A lot of it happens on a Teixcalaanli battleship. There's interstellar mail fraud. And a kitten. (Technically, several kittens). Also a maybe-genocide, some extremely unwise kissing, and the usual dose of political machination. I was inspired by the horror of apocalyptic violence which happened between Cortez and Moctezuma, for what that's worth. It comes out in 2020. After that, I hope that I get to write a novella about Nineteen Adze, and maybe some other books set in Teixcalaan — it's not a series, exactly, but it is a universe, and I love it very much and want to keep exploring it.

Fenway Park is Over 100 Years Old — Donnie Gardiner Keeps It Running,www.npr.org,Shira Springer,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710815697/fenway-park-is-over-100-years-old-donnie-gardiner-keeps-it-running,"Jesse Costa/WBUR
One of the toughest jobs in Major League Baseball might belong to Donnie Gardiner.
He’s the facilities superintendent at Fenway Park, the iconic 107-year-old home of the Boston Red Sox. It’s the oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball, and Gardiner’s job is to keep the place running.
That’s no small undertaking: Fenway Park has undergone major renovations in past years, including fixes to the field to help prevent flooding and the addition of more than 14,000 new seats.
To maintain the park, Gardiner puts in hundred-hour weeks, and occasionally sleeps in his office.
The season just started for the Red Sox. Ahead of the team’s home opener on Tuesday, Gardiner has had little time to waste. Water needed to be turned on to the concession stands, generators needed to be tested, emergency lighting needed to be checked and construction needed to be finished.
He bustled around Fenway, moving from the park’s new hot tub room, to the new training room, to the new video coaching room, getting updates and giving advice to workers.
“We have city inspections we have to worry about,” he said. “We have construction we have to finish up. We have just all kinds of things going on right now.”
As he talked, a racket of whirring equipment sounded around him — workers were installing walls, putting ceilings back together, painting, sanding, sawing and hammering.
Some of the challenges in renovating the ballpark are unpredictable, but Gardiner takes it all in stride. After all, he has worked at the ballpark for three decades.
Sometimes, Gardiner must work around brass waterlines that have stood the test of time. Other times, he uncovers remnants from Fenway’s past.
“When we ripped up the concourse a few years ago it was like an archaeological dig, finding the old nip bottles, is what we call them today, old shoes,” he said. “And the place was, I’m assuming, heated by coal because we found a lot of coal ash out in center field.”
Though soft-spoken, Gardiner has a commanding presence. He is constantly making important decisions about the park’s upkeep, and with an area as small as Fenway’s, every decision, every inch, matters.
Gardiner likes to say he’s playing a “game of inches.” With almost every decision, he has to figure out how to make the best use of limited space while preserving the park’s character.
“Everything we’ve done to this place has not taken away from the allure of the park … The feel is still there,” he said. “This building has a feel to it. It does for me personally. I’ve touched every inch of this place at one time or another.”
Fenway Park facilities superintendent Donnie Gardiner discusses construction work in the visiting team’s clubhouse with a contractor.

Aside from fitting in more seats, another upgrade Gardiner has overseen at the ballpark is renovating the clubhouses.
Many teams have outgrown Fenway’s cozy clubhouses, so there’s always plenty of work for Gardiner to do on both the Red Sox’s team clubhouse and for the visiting team’s clubhouse area. All the renovations at the park are done equally.
“I’m not playing one side over the other. Whatever we do for one we do for the other,” he said.
Now that a new season has started, Gardiner’s focus has shifted from renovations to preventative maintenance.
“Game days are actually easier for the most part. If we do our job right the building runs itself.”
Still, Gardiner is typically too busy monitoring what’s happening off the field to pay attention to the game itself.
He takes pride in the green painted walls, the rows and rows of seats crammed onto every space imaginable and the bright stadium lights that shine down on it all.
“It’s unlike any other building,” Gardiner said of Fenway Park. “It’s not Joe’s Pizza. It’s not a high rise. It’s not a supermarket. It’s a very unique building. And the way it’s used is very unique. That’s what I love about it. I’d get bored anywhere else.”

Latest Collateral Damage In U.S.-Russia Spat: An Anglo-American School Is Shut,www.npr.org,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/28/652518771/latest-collateral-damage-in-u-s-russia-spat-an-anglo-american-school-is-shut,"Diplomatic Corps In Moscow Shrinks Just When U.S.-Russia Tensions Are At A High
With those consulates gone, the Anglo-American School began to look for a new sponsoring organization to take over its lease and other legal obligations. Teachers and parents believed the school had until June 2019.
But on Sept. 20, the city of St. Petersburg's diplomatic properties agency informed the school it had to close within less than a week. The next day, a Friday, administrators emailed parents that their children would have to collect their belongings the following Monday — and that school was out for good.
The St. Petersburg school was an offshoot of the Anglo-American School of Moscow and founded by the U.S., Britain and Canada in 1975, when Russia's old imperial capital was called Leningrad.
The school originally catered largely to the children of diplomats from those three English-speaking countries. But the school later attracted a diverse student body from two dozen countries, whose parents worked for other diplomatic missions and foreign companies. The largest contingent of pupils came from South Korea, followed by Russia. It taught pre-K to 12th grade .
""It is a regrettable decision by the Russian authorities which will damage the education of the children at the school and make St. Petersburg less attractive as a place to do business,"" Britain's Foreign Office said in an email to NPR.
The Russian authorities insist they had no alternative but to close the school, which, because it was located in a building outside the premises of the U.S. Consulate, required special permission from the Russian Foreign Ministry.
""Over the course of many years, we suggested that the American side resolve the status of the school in accordance with Russian legislation,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to NPR. That demand was clearly stated in a diplomatic note sent on Sept. 8, 2017, the ministry said.
A week earlier, on Aug. 31, 2017, the U.S. had ordered the Russian Consulate in San Francisco closed amid a diplomatic tit-for-tat between the two countries. When the Trump administration then also shut down the Russian Consulate in Seattle in March, the Kremlin responded by ending the U.S. diplomatic presence in St. Petersburg.
The school can have no claim to ""some kind of special, quasi-diplomatic status"" now that the U.S. Consulate is gone, said the Foreign Ministry, blaming its ""American partners"" for not settling the school's status before its lease expired.
The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.
Over the summer, the Russian Foreign Ministry required about half of the Anglo-American School's 30 teachers to leave the city, as they held U.S. diplomatic passports. The school scrambled to stay open, partially by promoting local teaching assistants. Brookes Education Group , which runs a network of international schools, was identified as a possible new parent organization.
While local authorities in St. Petersburg gave school administrators the impression they could remain in the leased building until a deal with Brookes was finalized, the Foreign Ministry continued to insist on its closure, especially after the State Department announced new economic sanctions against Russia in August.
For now, although classes are no longer in session, furniture and equipment remain in the building as parents seek to reopen it.
The American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, a U.S. business lobbying group, has criticized the Foreign Ministry's decision to close the school.
The business group says it's working with authorities in St. Petersburg to allow students to resume their studies."

Ben Curtis/AP With the start of collective mourning set to last for months, Rwandans are marking 25 years since a genocide that killed hundreds of thousands of people.
In Rwanda's capital, Kigali, on Sunday, President Paul Kagame led foreign dignitaries and Rwandans in memorial ceremonies , including laying wreaths of white flowers and lighting a flame at the Kigali Genocide Memorial. The flame will burn for 100 days, the entirety of the annual period of mourning, which mirrors the length of the genocide.
About 800,000 Rwandans, most of them from the country's Tutsi minority, were killed during the 1994 genocide.
""Twenty-five years later, here we are,"" Kagame said . ""All of us. Wounded and heartbroken, yes. But unvanquished.""
Leaders of Chad, Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Niger, Belgium, Canada, Ethiopia, the African Union and the European Union were among the many in attendance, The Associated Press reports .
Parallels Rwanda Honors Dead, Celebrates Progress, 20 Years After Genocide After the ceremony, Rwandans walked through the city , from the Rwandan Parliament to the city's Amahoro Stadium, for a night vigil.

Ben Curtis/AP During the commemoration period in previous years, Rwandans have held memorial ceremonies in villages and districts where victims are buried, listening to survivors give testimony and local and national leaders tell the history of the genocide, according to The Conversation .
Ethnic violence broke out in Rwanda on April 7, 1994, after President Juvénal Habyarimana of the country's Hutu majority died in a plane crash , along with Burundi's Hutu president. Hutus said that Tutsi rebels had shot down the plane as it had approached Kigali's airport.
Killing began within hours, as many in the country turned on the Tutsis and even moderate Hutus, often targeting their own neighbors. The violence continued until Tutsi-led rebels took control of the capital in July 1994.
The genocide was marked by a rapid, well-organized campaign of violence, as well as the systematic rape of hundreds of thousands of women . Some victims were buried in mass graves that went undiscovered for more than two decades, including four unmarked graves discovered just last year .
The violence also highlighted a failure on the part of international peacekeeping forces. Shortly after the genocide began, the U.N. Security Council pulled most U.N. peacekeepers out of Rwanda, causing the tragedy to be ""compounded by the faltering response of the international community,"" according to the United Nations .
World Recalling Rwanda's Brutal '100 Days' David Simon, co-director of Yale University's Genocide Studies Program, said that the withdrawal of forces stemmed in part from France's connection to the genocidal regime.
""[Rwandans] remain, I think, justifiably very angry at the way the world, especially in the form of the United Nations but also the French in particular, let them down,"" Simon told NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro . ""And that still reverberates in 2019.""
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday that he wanted to create a national day of commemoration for the genocide.
On Friday, Macron ordered a government study into France's role in Rwanda before and during the genocide, the AP reported . A group of researchers and historians has been tasked with investigating the ""role and involvement of France"" and drawing conclusions within two years."

Patrick Madden/WAMU Patrick Madden/WAMU At George Mason University in Virginia, a fleet of several dozen autonomous robots deliver food to students on campus.
Patrick Madden/WAMU George Mason University looks like any other big college campus with its tall buildings, student housing, and manicured green lawns – except for the robots.
This Northern Virginia university recently set up several dozen meal delivery robots from Starship Technologies to make it easier for students to access food.
Multiple colleges across the country have deployed delivery robots – including University of the Pacific in Stockton, Calif., and Northern Arizona University – but George Mason University is the first college in the United States to incorporate robots into its student dining plan. The school is partnering with food service provider Sodexo for the program.
""We were amazed by the volume of orders that we had when we turned the service on,"" Starship Technologies executive Ryan Tuohy says. ""But what's really touching is how the students on the campus have embraced the robots.""
All Tech Considered Hungry? Call Your Neighborhood Delivery Robot Student Grace Pereira-Plaza says she finds the robots ""pretty adorable"" and at first students were obsessed with them — taking pictures, selfies, dressing them up for holidays. But they slowly got used to them.
""We find it normal now, seeing them go by, it's like 'oh there they are,' "" Pereira-Plaza says.
How does it work? Students can place an order through an app for any restaurant that is part of the program. The cost is $1.99 per delivery. Then, they wait. The goal: a 30-minute delivery. And just like Uber, students can watch the vehicle as it travels toward them – at 4 miles an hour.

Kevin Anderson/AP A suspected rhino poacher was killed by an elephant and his remains likely eaten by a pride of lions, park officials in South Africa said.
Kruger National Park rangers received a call last week from the family of the suspected poacher, the park said in a statement issued Friday. According to the family, accomplices of their relative said he was killed by an elephant on Tuesday, while they were in the park to poach rhinos.
The elephant attacked ""suddenly,"" police Brig. Leonard Hlathi told South African news website TimesLive . Hlathi said the man's accomplices claimed to have carried his body to a road before leaving the park.
Rangers began search efforts to find the man's remains and bring the family closure but could not locate a body.
""Indications found at the scene suggested that a pride of lions had devoured the remains leaving only a human skull and a pair of pants,"" the statement reads. The remains were found in the Crocodile Bridge section of the park.
Observers were quick to point out the apparent irony. ""It's the Circle of life,"" one commentator quipped on Twitter.
Glenn Phillips, managing executive of the park, issued his condolences to the deceased's family. ""Entering Kruger National Park illegally and on foot is not wise, it holds many dangers and this incident is evidence of that,"" Phillips said in the statement.
Police are investigating the incident, and the other four suspected poachers have been arrested and will appear in court, according to the statement.
The Two-Way Suspected Poacher Eaten By Lions In South Africa It's not the first time animals have killed a suspected poacher in South Africa. Last year, one was attacked and eaten by a pride of lions in Limpopo province, police said.
The number of rhinos poached in South Africa has trended down since 2014, but demand for the animal's horn, nonetheless, remains strong,"

HOSSEIN MERSADI/AFP/Getty Images Flooding in Iran has killed at least 70 people, and forced the mass evacuation of thousands, as heavy rain continues to fall on much of the country.
Mansoureh Bagheri, Director of International Relations at the Iranian Red Crescent Society, spoke with NPR from Tehran, Iran. ""Since March 16, we've started three rounds of rainfall in Iran. It started from the north part of Iran, and I can say it engaged the whole provinces. Out of 31 provinces, almost 24 provinces have been impacted by the severe rainfall,"" Bagheri said.
The floods occurred during Iran's new year holiday of Norwuz , and left many stranded. The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reports floods killed people across 13 provinces. According to IRNA, ""The disaster began with heavy rainfalls in the northern provinces of Iran since March 19, and continued across Iran with flash floods in southern, central and western provinces.""
Iran's Mehr News Agency reports some 1,900 cities and villages have been flooded, ""causing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to Iranian water and agriculture infrastructures.""
Bagheri told NPR, ""The destruction is high. I can say regarding the agriculture, regarding the infrastructure, regarding the livelihood, the impact is high.""
CNN reports more than 140 rivers have burst their banks; 409 landslides have been reported; 78 roads have been blocked; and 84 bridges have been affected.
Iran's Foreign Ministry has said U.S. sanctions on Iran are blocking humanitarian aid to flood-hit areas.

— Javad Zarif (@JZarif) April 2, 2019 On April 2, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement on the flooding in Iran:
""These floods once again show the level of Iranian regime mismanagement in urban planning and in emergency preparedness. The regime blames outside entities when, in fact, it is their mismanagement that has led to this disaster,"" he said. ""The United States stands ready to assist and contribute to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which would then direct the money through the Iranian Red Crescent for relief.""
Bagheri told NPR sanctions are having an impact on donations to the IFRC. ""The sanctions actually impede their receiving international donations from the international community, and also from Iranians living abroad,"" he said.
Al Jazeera reports that dozens of villages and towns in southern Iran have been evacuated as authorities issue warnings for more flooding in regions bordering Iraq. According to Al Jazeera, Iraq officially closed the Chazabeh border crossing after Iranian authorities banned travelling and trade through the border in the southern province of Khuzestan."
#NPRPoetry Month: Richard Blanco Reads Your Twitter Poems,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710867501/-nprpoetry-month-richard-blanco-reads-your-twitter-poems,"For National Poetry Month, NPR's Michel Martin speaks with poet Richard Blanco about his latest work and his favorite listener-submitted poems.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Now it's time for one of our favorite things - poetry. Every year in April, Poetry Month, we ask listeners to share original tweet-length poems, and every week this month, we will read through your submissions. This year, we have been honored to have a number of award-winning poets combing through submissions with us. Joining us this week is Richard Blanco. In 2013, he delivered the poem ""One Today"" at President Obama's second inauguration. And he is just out with a new collection of poems called ""How To Love A Country."" And he's with us now from Miami.
Richard Blanco, thank you so much for being with us once again.
RICHARD BLANCO: Thank you. It's wonderful to be here.
MARTIN: So let's talk for a minute about your work before we get to the submissions, if that's OK.
BLANCO: Sure.
MARTIN: At the 2013 inauguration, you wrote about an America united in its differences under one sky. Has your work changed since you were the inaugural poet? Especially, you know - I have to ask - since the 2016 election?
BLANCO: Oh, most certainly. I think that's one of the last transformations that happened because of the inauguration - because writing the poem itself but also the experience of reading that poem to a million people in front of me and 40 million on TV. And I think what would happen is that I stepped into my shoes or my role as a civic poet - something that I had never - sort of had skirted around - but this idea of thinking about what a poem can and should do in the world.
And so I just started writing poems that were more socially engaged, more socially conscious - writing poems like, for example, after the Boston Marathon bombings, after the Pulse shooting, thinking about how poetry occupies public space and speaks to current events and also, historically, to some of these other issues of gender, race and whatnot.
So, like I like to say, a different time has demanded a different kind of poem for me. And I think you see that with a lot of poets lately in the United States.
MARTIN: Well, let's get - I just have to say, I just think it's exquisite. And it's so interesting, like, how you play with classic language that we all know - like, for example, in your first poem, the poem that opens the book, ""Declaration Of Inter-Dependence,"" which is interwoven with words from the Declaration of Independence. And also, you know, throughout the book, you use words other than English. And can you just give me one - just a couple of lines that you feel we should share? Would you mind?
BLANCO: Yeah. I'll read from that poem that you just mentioned, which I think is sort of the manifesto of the book in a way, which is to - let's move from the place of independence to a place of interdependence, right? So this is the last stanza.
(Reading) We hold these truths to be self-evident - where the cure for the hatred caused by our despair, where the good morning of a bus driver who remembers our name, the tattooed man who gives up his seat on the subway, where every door held open with a smile, when we look into each other's eyes the way, we behold the moon, with the moon, with a promise of one people, one breath declaring to one another, I see you. I need you. I am you.
So moving from this sense of - from dependence, independence to interdependence, and let's come together and think about this for a minute.
MARTIN: Well, that is a good segue to the poems that our listeners sent to us. Now, we've already gotten a lot of submissions, and we asked you to choose a couple that stood out to you. Here's one of them being read by its author.
ANTHONY TAO: My name is Anthony Tao. My poem is called ""Career Path.""
(Reading) They said art was misery, so I sought it - but it's not like you think, not rejection of comfort, self-mutilation. It was accepting who I am is the person I will live with for the rest of this path, which I'd prefer end some place I imagine.
MARTIN: Wow.
TAO: I love this poem because I think that poetry comes across in the one sense - or it begins in a space of really incredible self-expression and almost to the point of really self-absorbed with your own emotions. But what people don't often understand about poetry, I think, is that it's also a way of objectifying your life and realizing that the poem is an act of imagination, and the idea that you develop an artistic persona that becomes some other version of yourself in the poem.
And so I love that this poem is really pulling that apart and so economically and with such tight language. I mean, and this idea of - I'll repeat - which I'd prefer end some place I imagine, right? Sometimes we write to imagine our lives and ourselves in a different possibility that the art itself, the act of writing poetry is what does that. So I love that about this poem (laughter).
MARTIN: OK. Well, you know, since you love that poem so much, I think I'll just end with asking you, since you've taught a lot - I mean, you've taught poetry in prisons and in universities. You're the education ambassador for the Academy of American Poets. What advice do you have for listeners who want to craft their own poems?
BLANCO: Well, I mean, just very general and sort of very practical advice - always sign up for a workshop. We need feedback from our work always. And I always tell my students to - look, you want to play football? What do you got to do, right? You've got to first of all learn the rules, right? You got to learn (laughter) what a touchdown is, right? And then you've got to get your butt out on the field and practice and practice. And you've got to wake about 6 in the morning. You've got to stay after school for another three hours.
So I always try to tell people, think of writing in that way, too. You know, it - almost every human endeavor is pretty much a similar process of effort, failing, trying again. And it's just to think of it in those terms - I think it helps us to think of how to navigate through poetry and learning the craft.
MARTIN: That was poet Richard Blanco. His new book of poems, ""How To Love A Country,"" is available now.
Richard, thank you so much for talking with us once again.
BLANCO: Thank you.
MARTIN: And if you'd like to hear your original poem on the air, tweet it to @npratc with the hashtag #NPRPoetry every week for the rest of the month. A professional poet will join us on the program to talk about some submissions that caught his or her eye. And even though Twitter has changed its character limit since we started this project, we're sticking with the original rules. Poems must be 140 characters or less.

Louisiana Looks For Answers After Fires Destroy 3 Historically Black Churches,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710867494/louisiana-looks-for-answers-after-fires-destroy-3-historically-black-churches,"Three predominantly black churches burned in Louisiana's St. Landry Parish in the span of 10 days. NPR's Michel Martin gets an update from reporter Katie Gagliano of The Acadiana Advocate .
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're heading now to Louisiana, where three historically black churches have been destroyed by fires in the span of 10 days. Federal authorities have now joined the investigation into the fires, which started on March 26 in St. Landry Parish. No deaths or injuries were reported in connection with the fires. But all three churches house generations of worshippers, and their congregants are devastated. Katie Gagliano is with us now to tell us more. She's a reporter with The Acadiana Advocate, and she's with us from Broussard, La.
Katie, thanks so much for joining us.
KATIE GAGLIANO: Hi. Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: So, first of all, could you just get us oriented? Where did all these fires take place? Give us a sense of where you are.
GAGLIANO: The fires took place in St. Landry Parish, which is a small parish just north of Lafayette. The two towns that it happened in are very close together - just minutes apart. The towns are Opelousas and Port Barre.
MARTIN: And where the churches were located - are these mainly rural areas? Were there people around?
GAGLIANO: So the churches where the fires happened are in rural areas, and that's one of the connecting factors between the fires. So the three churches were located on state highways in rural areas - you know, not too many people around, not many witnesses. And that's some of the talk that's happening about connections between these fires.
MARTIN: The fact that these are all historically African-American churches I would assume gives rise to some of that concern - I mean, given the fact that there's a history. Not just in Louisiana, but they may remember that in 1996, there was a spate of church fires. And this has happened in sort of other places. And I'm wondering whether that history is informing people's reactions to this in some way.
GAGLIANO: I think it definitely is. And race is part of the conversation around these fires. Now, of course, people are still trying to determine, were these churches targeted because they're historically African-American churches in this community? And that's something that we don't know yet, but it's definitely, I think, at the top of people's minds. And I was at a meeting of local pastors, including the three pastors of the churches that burned down, earlier this week on Thursday, and it's something they were discussing.
But at the same time, they were saying they're praying that this isn't race-based, that this is not the reason. They hope that no one in their community would do this for those reasons. You know, they're preparing themselves to face that if that's the case. But they're also trying not to stoke fear if that is not the case. So they're not at the point yet of saying they think this was a racist incident because they don't want to frighten their communities more than they already are. But if that is the result, they're ready to confront that as a group.
MARTIN: Could you talk a little bit more about what these churches mean to the community?
GAGLIANO: Of course. These churches have - like you said, have been around for over 100 years in these communities. I know two of the pastors said their churches have been around for 144, 146 years. People's families have attended these churches for generations. I saw, at the churches I visited, one church had a church cemetery immediately behind the building where the fire happened. People that were at the scene told me their family members are buried there. The pastor - this was at Greater Union Baptist - Reverend Harry Richard, his grandfather helped start the church. They have family buried on the grounds. I mean, these are places that have played roles in these families' lives for decades.
MARTIN: Did these congregations find places to meet today?
GAGLIANO: They did have places to meet today. I think two of the congregations were meeting in more kind of locally owned businesses. Another church, their pastor was also a pastor at another church in the community, and they were joining in with that congregation. So the local church community has been reaching out very heavily to these congregations to offer them places to pray, to worship, to continue having funerals, baptisms so that they can continue on as normal as they try to rebuild.
MARTIN: That's Katie Gagliano. She's a reporter with The Acadiana Advocate. She was kind enough to join us from Broussard, La.
Katie, thanks so much for talking to us.
GAGLIANO: Of course. Thank you.

Maryland High School Students Confront Male Behavior In #MeToo,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710867487/maryland-high-school-students-confront-male-behavior-in-metoo,"Former Vice President Joe Biden has been called out for behavior that has made women uncomfortable. At a high school in Maryland, students are having similar discussions about their own behavior.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
The national conversation about what constitutes appropriate behavior between men and women came to a high school in Maryland recently. Eighteen senior girls had been ranked by some of their male peers based on their looks. NPR's Eliza Dennis reports on what the girls did next.
ELIZA DENNIS, BYLINE: They call it the list, and it left many girls at the Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School upset, angry and ready for change. Paloma Delgado, a senior, was already organizing an event to address just this type of behavior. It was called the ABCs of Modern Masculinity - Raising Boys Without Lowering Expectations. And it couldn't have come at a better time.
(CHEERING)
PALOMA DELGADO: Thank you guys all so much for coming out.
DENNIS: Paloma ran part of the event from a high-top table in a local restaurant. It was packed. Students doubled up in armchairs and sat on the floor. With help from her family and a high school teacher, Paloma put together four and a half hours of student and guest speeches, a film screening and a panel discussion, all about boys and masculinity.
PALOMA: I think we need to hold them to a higher level of accountability because I think we can expect more from them.
DENNIS: The evening wasn't supposed to be that long. But when news of the list leaked, Paloma decided to add some speakers, including senior Virginia Brown.
VIRGINIA BROWN: I could have been ranked a 0.0 or a 10.0, and it wouldn't have made a difference to me. I think the...
DENNIS: Brown was on the list. At first, she was angry.
VIRGINIA: Because you feel so violated. I think you feel very - just gross being in your own body. I remember walking into class and seeing them. I just felt like I had to stay in my desk the whole period, like, sitting behind them so they couldn't see me because I just felt like everywhere I was, I was just being analyzed, like something I would do might bring me down to a lower ranking.
DENNIS: According to The Washington Post, which brought national attention to this story, the administration investigated the list and gave one male student one day of in-school detention.
VIRGINIA: We decided that in-school suspension for a day wasn't enough. They could just sit there. They could joke around. They would do their homework. And life would go on. And this would happen again.
DENNIS: Instead of calling the boys out, the students chose to call them in. They didn't demand that they not walk at graduation or miss prom. They chose to help them learn. And that process started even before Paloma's event. The school convened a meeting. For more than two hours, a group of girls and boys got together to discuss the list and how it made them feel. Nicola Schmidt was watching her male classmates' reactions.
NICOLA SCHMIDT: They went into the meeting first, you know, with a very negative attitude toward the whole situation and kind of like, this isn't our fault. This happens all the time. Like, why are we in trouble for this?
DENNIS: But, says Gabriela Jeliazkov, the mood changed quickly.
GABRIELA JELIAZKOV: So many girls shared their experiences with sexual harassment, with eating disorders, with catcalling and how it's an everyday part of their life. And a lot of people didn't even leave with dry eyes.
GREGORY SHANE: Before, I wasn't really thinking about this.
DENNIS: That's Gregory Shane (ph).
GREGORY: And I could even see how within my own behavior, there are times when I should have told my friends to stop.
DENNIS: And the girls said the meeting worked. A group of students, including some of those responsible for the list, are now working on a presentation to educate younger students about misogynistic behavior and how to address it. So the discussion is not over. And Nicola Schmidt says that's a good thing.
NICOLA: I think we couldn't have expected a better outcome because when the boys came out of the meeting after hearing our stories, they realized that this is so much more than just a list. It's about, like, a whole toxic culture that they were playing into and that, like, we had to live in.

"Israel's Netanyahu Embraces Populist Allies, Driving Opposition At Home",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710867480/israels-netanyahu-embraces-populist-allies-driving-opposition-at-home,"During his decade in power, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expanded Israel's diplomatic reach. And he's embraced nationalists like Putin, Orban and Duterte.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will seek re-election after a decade in power. NPR's Daniel Estrin has been reporting on some of the ways Israel has changed under Netanyahu as the country has shifted further to the right.
This next report looks at Netanyahu's reach across the globe and how he's embraced nationalist leaders.
DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Benjamin Netanyahu runs a country the size of New Jersey, but he's become one of the world's most recognizable leaders. He's also made Israel some new friends - rolling out the red carpet for leaders from India to Hungary to the Philippines.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: My friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, welcome to Israel.
Mi amigo, president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro.
President Duterte, welcome to Israel.
Prime Minister Orban. Viktor, welcome to Jerusalem.
Mr. President, my dear friend, Donald.
ESTRIN: Israel knows what it's like to be put in the corner by the world for its policies toward the Palestinians. But Netanyahu says he's changing that dynamic. Two weeks ago, he met President Trump at the White House. Last week, he met Russian president Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin and hosted Brazil's president, Bolsonaro. It's a centerpiece of his re-election campaign.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
NETANYAHU: (Speaking Hebrew).
ESTRIN: This election ad says, we've brought an unprecedented diplomatic flourishing. It's one of Netanyahu's talking points with the press.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
NETANYAHU: China designated Israel as one of the two countries with whom they have a special relationship on innovation. India, our trade is bursting through the seams.
ESTRIN: Netanyahu says countries are flocking to Israel for its intelligence and security expertise, and for its technologies in agriculture, water, cybersecurity. Even relations with Gulf Arab countries that are technically still Israel's enemies are coming out of the shadows.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
NETANYAHU: The new story is this - Israel is a world force in conquering radical Islam. The Arabs get it. The Muslims get it. And they're coming closer to us. Israel is a world force in global technology. Everybody gets that - everybody.
ESTRIN: In a meeting with foreign reporters, he said they should report on that.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
NETANYAHU: Yes, we'll talk about the Palestinians. Now ask me about that. This is an extraordinary story. Don't miss it. Don't lose out. It's big.
ESTRIN: But Netanyahu's new alliances have sparked some protests at home.
(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Foreign language spoken).
ESTRIN: Last week, demonstrators chanted outside Netanyahu's residence as he hosted Bolsonaro. A block away, I meet Israeli Esther Barcelone (ph) crossing the street and asked her about the far right - Brazilian leader.
ESTHER BARCELONE: It's revolting because he's a fascist. He's a racist. And I feel that those are the only ones that are our friends now.
ESTRIN: In the last few years, Netanyahu has embraced nationalists, populists and strongmen leaders, like Duterte of the Philippines, who's forces have killed thousands amid a crackdown on drugs and who had to apologize for comparing himself to Hitler. And Viktor Orban of Hungary and Poland's leaders, who have downplayed their country's role in the Holocaust. Former director general of Israel's foreign ministry and Netanyahu aide Dore Gold defends Netanyahu's alliances with these leaders.
DORE GOLD: Israel is not going to get drawn into this whole discourse in the West about populism and populist politicians, especially since the old elites treated Israel in a discriminatory way.
ESTRIN: He's talking about Western European countries, he says, criticize Israel for human rights controversies more than they do other countries. Netanyahu's courting leaders around the world to chip away at the European Union's positions on Israel and to change voting patterns at the United Nations, where Israel is regularly on the defensive.
I met some former Israeli ambassadors at a Tel Aviv cafe to talk about Netanyahu's new alliances. They're old timers who have shaped Israel's foreign relations throughout the decades. Yosef Livne defended Netanyahu's many meetings with Putin.
YOSEF LIVNE: It's a power - the one that calls the shots or most of the shots in Syria. So I don't think that there's room here for lovey-dovey elements. It's real politics.
ESTRIN: Israeli realpolitik isn't new. In Israel's early days, when it was more isolated internationally, it sold arms to apartheid South Africa and Latin American dictatorships. But former Ambassador Barukh Binah thinks that approach shouldn't be necessary anymore.
BARUKH BINAH: In the past, we could not make a choice between friend A, friend B. Whoever would like to be our friends, we would be friends with them. Now, we are no longer bad guys. We are a strong, little country.
ESTRIN: Netanyahu says what's important is a country's relationship with Israel, not its domestic politics. But former Ambassador to France Daniel Shek thinks Netanyahu's approach has risked Israel's reputation.
DANIEL SHEK: I think there's a clear choice that was made by Israel's foreign policy over the last decade, and that is to virtually leave the club of liberal democracies and join the growing - I must say - growing club of populist authoritarian regimes. The accession of someone like Donald Trump has given this trend a big push.
ESTRIN: Ambassadors Binah and Shek, both self-described liberals, hope that after 10 years of Netanyahu's rule, Israel can remain in the club of liberal countries and that such a club even continues to exist. Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Jerusalem.

Democratic Congresswoman Xochitl Torres Small, from New Mexico's 2nd District, tells NPR's Michel Martin how she thinks the government should address border security.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to start the program today with another take on border security. And for that, we're going to turn to Democratic congresswoman Xochitl Torres Small. She represents New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District, and she sits on the House Homeland Security Committee. Now, she was part of that blue wave you heard so much about last November. She took an open seat that had been held for most of the last four decades by Republicans. But she and Republican Congressman Will Hurd of Texas recently introduced two pieces of bipartisan legislation meant to address challenges facing Customs and Border Protection. And Representative Torres Small is with us now.
Congresswoman, thank you so much for speaking with us.
XOCHITL TORRES SMALL: Michel, thank you so much for having me.
MARTIN: So, you know, the legislation you introduced with Republican Congressman Will Hurd focuses specifically on changes you think are necessary to be made to Customs and Border Protection. Now, you know, I think many people know that some of your colleagues on the Democratic side have called for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be abolished entirely.
Now, I think we can all agree that their perspective on this has been misunderstood. They're not saying that there shouldn't be any kind of border security at all. What they're saying is that the current arrangement, the current institutions aren't functioning and that they say we should, you know, scrap that and start over. But what do you say needs to be done?
TORRES SMALL: My concern with that approach is that there's a failure to be willing to work with everyone to find the right solutions. And there's a failure to be willing to identify that we do have to enforce our laws, and we have to enforce our laws in a way that reflects our values. So I think what we need to do is identify what our needs are along every stretch of our U.S.-Mexico border and find the right ways to fill them.
So that's why one of the first piece of legislation that I introduced with Congressman Will Hurd as well as Congressman Dan Crenshaw asks Customs and Border Protection to put together a recruitment and retention strategy for our rural areas because we lack the personnel that we need there. And it's hard to keep folks in these areas where they're most needed, especially as we see the changing flows and people who are voluntarily presenting, sometimes in these remote areas that lack that infrastructure and network - with health care providers, for example.
MARTIN: I understand that what you're saying is that there's a turnover problem in these areas. But is the issue here the turnover? Is the issue that there aren't enough people there to begin with?
TORRES SMALL: My concern is that there aren't people in the right places. And that's because it's harder to keep people. We've got that turnover problem in our most remote areas. I'm also concerned that CBP is not quickly adapting to these changing circumstances. For example, all of this discussion about a wall across the U.S.-Mexico border really doesn't focus on the fact that we're seeing more people voluntarily presenting along the border, and a wall would not be effective in addressing that.
Instead, we need to do things like have more immigration judges along the border to help clarify the asylum process and get to a quicker resolution. We need more people to help process these claims, and we need the technology to do so. Right now, there are places along the U.S.-Mexico border with such poor internet connection that it's making that processing time even longer. So if we looked at the resources that were really needed to face the problem now and took a bipartisan approach instead of trying to score political points against each other, I think we'd have a much better opportunity to address this situation.
MARTIN: Part of what I think I hear you saying, though, is that some of the entities working in that area don't have the right skillset for the problem that is actually there, which is that people who need - and I think what I hear you saying is you need social workers. And one of the reasons I raise that is one of the children who died, one of the migrant children who died in custody, in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection - you know, well, one of them came to the U.S. through your district, and one of the children died in your district. And a lot of people have raised questions about, you know, how that could have happened.
And what I - one of the things I think I hear you saying is perhaps the people who - to whom these children were presented didn't have the right skills to understand what was going on with them. Is that part of what's going on here?
TORRES SMALL: Michel, I think you're right. It's two separate things. We need the resources and the people with the skills necessary to process individuals who are voluntarily presenting. We also need the medical training necessary to do initial screenings and then to identify when it's necessary - not simply relying on parents' words, but when it's necessary to take someone to receive more care. We need to make sure that the facilities are better equipped to address those situations. And then we need to have enough agents who are able to do their job of stopping people who are trying to evade detection, which is still happening.
And folks are very concerned. Law enforcement that I've talked to are frustrated that they're not able to, one, do their job with the people who are voluntarily presenting and make sure that they have a safe place to be held and, two, that they're not able to identify other people who are trying to evade detection because they are so overburdened with the processing of people who are voluntarily presenting.
MARTIN: That is Representative Xochitl Torres Small. She represents New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District.
Congresswoman, thanks so much for talking with us. I hope this will be our first conversation, not our only conversation about this complicated topic.

'Amazing Grace' Gets LA Premiere In Church Where It Took Place,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710247560/aretha-franklins-amazing-grace-gets-la-premiere-in-the-church-where-it-took-plac,"The Sound Made Flesh
""Against the better advice of her recording company, she decided to go back into the church and record a gospel album,"" Sabrina Owens, Aretha Franklin's niece, says.
Owens, who was 14 at the time, wasn't there those two nights. And like many, she didn't know that a young Sydney Pollack, who would later direct Tootsie and Out of Africa , was there. He was filming the entire event, which was hosted by Franklin's longtime mentor, himself a giant figure in gospel music, Reverend James Cleveland, the former minister of music at Aretha's father's church in Detroit.
Pollack captured the electric, soulful performance. He also captured the sweat on Franklin's face and audience members dancing in the aisles. He captured the experience of being there. Unfortunately, he failed to capture the film takes with a clapperboard, so it was impossible to synchronize the audio with the images.
""When you see it, then it's a different experience,"" producer Alan Elliott, who grew up obsessed with that album, explains. ""Because then you can see that James Cleveland breaks down in the middle of 'Amazing Grace' and starts crying, and has to leave the piano.""

Before Pollack died of cancer in 2008, he gave Elliott his blessing to try to finish the film. Elliott mortgaged his own house to buy the negative from Warner Brothers without knowing about the synchronization issue. ""And so, there was this bipolarity to it,"" Elliot says. ""Which was: 'Oh my God, we have to start from scratch.' And then on the other side: 'Oh my God, we have all the footage.' Then, there was an opportunity, and that was really exciting.""
Fortunately, technological advancements enabled Elliott to sync the sound. He fashioned a 90-minute concert film with no narration, no interviews, just Aretha singing her heart out backed by the Reverend Cleveland and the Southern California Community Choir.
But there was another major obstacle: Aretha Franklin. The singer sued Elliott in 2011 to prevent a private screening and she stopped him from premiering the film at the Telluride Film Festival in 2015 , and again in 2016. No one really knows why she didn't want the film to come out, though after she died in August, her family was quick to green light the release.
""All the technical difficulties are fixed and when I saw it, it was such a moving and powerful experience, I thought that everybody deserved to see it,"" Owens says. ""And since Aretha did not have an issue with the content of the film, only other things, she would have loved this. And I think she would have wanted her fanbase to see it.""

And so, on a cool spring night in Watts, the documentary team hosted a premiere of Amazing Grace right in The New Temple Missionary Baptist Church. The church has been retrofitted a little, but to Elliott, it's still a holy site. Even the big mural of Jesus in a river, which hovers over the choir throughout the concert film, is still there.
""The other day somebody asked me, 'What's the historical meaning of this church?'"" Elliot recalls. ""And I said, 'Well, you know, it's like what Mozart's church or Bach's church is, this is what this church is for gospel music.'""
Singer Eddie Kendrix was one of several people at the premiere who was there in 1972. ""I've known Aretha since she was like 13 years old,"" Kendrix says. ""She's always been bigger than life, so it was no mystery that all of this is going on. That's the type of talent she was.""
A number of original choir members, now with grayer hair and oxygen tanks, sat up front. Reverend Dr. Alexander Hamilton, who had directed the choir and arranged many of the songs, led his singers in two spirituals from a wheelchair. As the movie started, the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church once again became an Aretha Franklin concert and a church service all at once. ""You can't hardly listen to her without singing along,"" Kendrix says.

In 2014, Michael Brown, an 18-year old unarmed black man, was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
In the four months that followed, the stock price of the stun-gun maker Taser International, now known as Axon Enterprise, nearly doubled .
The following year, the Department of Justice launched a pilot program awarding more than $23.2 million in grants to expand the use of body cameras worn by police officers across the country.
Today, these types of technologies are often touted by law enforcement officials and policy makers as ways to improve policing and avoid tragic and controversial incidents.
But as their use becomes more common, to what extent are they actually solving the problems they've set out to fix?
The Two-Way Shots In The Back, Children Tasered: DOJ Details Excessive Force By Chicago Police That's the question investigative reporter Matt Stroud explores in his new book, The Thin Blue Lie: The Failure of High Tech Policing.
Law Police Expert: Tasers Should Be Used Only When Suspects Are Threats In the book, Stroud argues that for decades, politicians and law enforcement have often opted for quick, easy solutions to correct for problematic policing practices, rather than adopt more systematic overhauls. As a result, issues like excessive force have never been solved, he says.
""You have a system that is in place and you have officers who have often been on the job for 20 or 30 years, who were in leadership positions and they don't want to change,"" Stroud tells Michel Martin in an interview for NPR's All Things Considered.
One approach examined closely by Stroud is law enforcement's use of stun guns, which have been a part of the conversation around police reform since the late 1960s.
One of the first police departments to use stun guns was the Los Angeles Police Department, which adopted the weapon after facing heavy criticism surrounding a 1979 police shooting.

Graeme Robertson/Getty Images ""It was kind of the first time that this kind of weapon was used as a solution — was presented as a non-lethal solution in the wake of an incident involving a police killing,"" Stroud says.
Over the course of his research, Stroud says he found numerous examples of many stun gun related deaths. In 2018 alone, at least 49 people died after being shocked by police with stun guns, according to a Reuters analysis .
""The data has shown that Tasers do not reduce the number of firearms that are used on the streets and they have been shown to be lethal. So in that way they have failed to do what they were pitched to do,"" Stroud says.
A normal shock from a stun gun lasts five seconds. But as Stroud notes, ""When police officers pull the trigger over and over and over again to make that Taser shock last five seconds, and 10 seconds, and 25 seconds, that's when they become really dangerous.""
For his research, Stroud says he allowed himself to be stunned in his back for five seconds.
""It hurt. It's it's like a charlie horse that takes over your entire body. You can't move,"" he says. ""It felt like I was never gonna be able to move again.""

BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images Another technology examined by Stroud is the police body camera. It's an innovation with well-placed intentions, argues Stroud, but often he says, its potential goes unfulfilled.
Even though body cameras have been shown in studies not to influence police officers' use of force, Stroud says that body cameras can help bring transparency to police interactions, especially in the aftermath of controversial officer-involved shootings.
The problem, Stroud says, is that body-cam footage is not always made public.
""Where problems emerge is when government officials and police officials push back against making that footage public,"" he says.
When it is made public, he says it's often offered as exculpatory evidence.
""It ends up becoming a promotional vehicle rather than something that is designed to force transparency and show the truth,"" says Stroud.
Instead of investing millions of dollars into equipment like body cameras and stun guns, Stroud proposes a non-technological solution to problems like excessive use of force.
He points to a 1967 report from the U.S. Department of Justice that recommended, among other things, greater community involvement, increased hiring of minority police officers and better training on the use of force.
While Stroud acknowledges that some of these changes have occurred over the past several decades, he believes reforms have still not gone far enough. Since there are around 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the U.S., Stroud argues change needs to happen on a much broader scale.
""Unless you have some major event or leader that emerges in policing in the United States who forces this kind of change, then it's not going to happen.""

Reda&Co/UIG via Getty Images Ugandan police announced on Sunday that they have rescued an American woman and her driver after the two were kidnapped last week while on safari.
The Uganda Police Force said on Twitter that it had worked with security agencies to rescue the 35-year-old California woman and her Ugandan tour guide. Both are in ""good health,"" according to police.
The Ugandan government and U.S. media outlets have identified the woman as Kimberly Sue Endicott. The Ugandan government identified the driver as Jean Paul Mirenge.
Four men allegedly abducted the pair from their vehicle at gunpoint last Tuesday during an evening game drive at Queen Elizabeth National Park in southwestern Uganda and demanded $500,000 in ransom, police said. Four other tourists were left ""abandoned and unharmed,"" according to the Uganda Media Centre , the government's communications center.
Police did not offer further details about how the two were freed, and it's not clear if a ransom was paid. Citing the safari company with which they were traveling, The New York Times reported on Sunday that a ransom had in fact been paid.
American Kidnapped In Uganda, Held For Ransom, Police Say ""Pleased to report that the American tourist and tour guide that were abducted in Uganda have been released,"" President Trump tweeted Sunday . ""God bless them and their families!""
Ugandan politicians have stressed that the area where the two were taken is peaceful and have encouraged tourists to continue to visit. In a press release last week, police said the kidnapping was the first ""incident of this kind"" for the park and its surroundings, located near the country's border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Frank Tumwebaze, Uganda's minister of information and communications technology, wrote on Twitter on Sunday that the country is ""very safe.""
""Our parks have been the most secure zones over the years and they remain so,"" he wrote. ""Isolated criminal incidents like this particular one, can happen any where in the world. Every challenge helps us to improve our readiness.""
The U.S. Embassy in Uganda last week urged visitors to ""Exercise caution when traveling to this area due to ongoing security activity.""
News of the kidnapping came during a week when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told families of Americans held captive overseas that the U.S. ""cannot accept"" the risk of paying ransom in exchange for the return of individuals.
""Even a small payment to a group in, say, Africa can facilitate the killing or seizure of tens or even hundreds of others, including Americans or foreign nationals in that region,"" Pompeo said ."

Laurel Morales/KJZZ Laurel Morales/KJZZ After decades of dependency on coal for jobs, the Navajo Nation is turning to renewables. Two utility-scale solar farms have been built in recent years and another one is in the works.
Laurel Morales/KJZZ The Navajo and Hopi have fought hard to hold on to coal.
Three generations have worked for the West's largest coal-fired power plant, the Navajo Generating Station. The tribes have relied heavily on its revenue. So when the Phoenix-based Salt River Project announced it was shutting down the plant at the end of the year, the tribe scrambled to find a buyer or — as a last resort — purchase the plant.
It finally came down to a vote late last month at a Navajo Nation Council Special Session meeting. The delegates deliberated for eight hours.
""Are we ready?"" Delegate Nathaniel Brown said. ""Are we ready for the shutdown? I don't think we are. We stand to lose a lot, our children the future generation.""
Delegate Charlaine Tso said she's done with coal and its health impacts on her people. The plant is one of the country's biggest carbon emitters.
""Shame on you,"" Tso said. ""Money, money, money. It's replaceable. Enough is enough. This is the time that we're going to take a stand that we're going to come together for our people. I am ready to take on that challenge.""
Other delegates pointed out that many energy companies were moving away from coal in favor of cleaner and cheaper energy sources.
The council finally voted against the purchase.

Laurel Morales/KJZZ End of an era of resource extraction
That decision marks the end of an era. Before coal, many tribal members worked with the federal government to blast uranium out of the Navajo Nation to make atomic weapons.
""The Navajo economy had been kinda built upon resource extraction,"" said Brett Isaac, who grew up next to the Peabody Kayenta Coal Mine. ""I still have an uncle that works for the Peabody Energy Co. I've had other uncles and cousins and friends and ... You had a lot of people who that's the only industry and job they ever knew.""

Laurel Morales/KJZZ So a decade ago, when Isaac started installing off-grid solar panels in people's homes, people looked at him funny.
""But my family have more recently gotten more supportive with the way the world and global economy is moving towards a more renewable focus,"" Isaac said, laughing. ""They're motivated by the fact I got in so early, into it before it was cool.""
It takes the benefit of something that's abundant and converts it into something useable.
Brett Isaac, Navajo Power
Now Isaac and a group of entrepreneurs have formed Navajo Power, a renewable energy company that's trying to help the tribe shift away from coal. The tribe has built two utility-sized solar farms already and it's working on a third.
""It takes the benefit of something that's abundant and converts it into something usable,"" Isaac said. ""So that aligns a lot not only with Navajo philosophy, but a lot of indigenous communities about how you responsibly source things.""
There's just one problem. The number of jobs at a solar farm can't compare to coal. The plant and mine supplied 800 of the best-paying jobs on the Navajo Nation and many more support jobs.
Solar, on the other hand, requires hundreds of temporary employees to construct the farm, but after it's built the sun does most of the work. That's a tough sell to a tribe where half of the people are unemployed.
Isaac envisions solar farms sprouting up faster than corn on the vast reservation. And he has hopes they could build a manufacturing facility to assemble the panels.
""It starts with embracing change,"" said Navajo President Jonathan Nez, who's on board with the idea.
He just signed a proclamation to make renewable energy the tribe's top priority. But he's also realistic. He knows the tribe has to invest in other economic engines, like tourism.
""People all over the world come to Navajo,"" Nez said. ""If we could keep some of our visitors here on the Navajo Nation a little longer, that's going to bring dollars and jobs.""
He said ultimately they have to think about cleaner jobs and a cleaner environment for their children and their grandchildren."

Louisiana Looks For Answers After Fires Destroy 3 Historically Black Churches,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710867494/louisiana-looks-for-answers-after-fires-destroy-3-historically-black-churches?station=KXJZ_FM,"Three predominantly black churches burned in Louisiana's St. Landry Parish in the span of 10 days. NPR's Michel Martin gets an update from reporter Katie Gagliano of The Acadiana Advocate .
We're heading now to Louisiana, where three historically black churches have been destroyed by fires in the span of 10 days. Federal authorities have now joined the investigation into the fires, which started on March 26 in St. Landry Parish. No deaths or injuries were reported in connection with the fires. But all three churches house generations of worshippers, and their congregants are devastated. Katie Gagliano is with us now to tell us more. She's a reporter with The Acadiana Advocate, and she's with us from Broussard, La.
Katie, thanks so much for joining us.
KATIE GAGLIANO: Hi. Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: So, first of all, could you just get us oriented? Where did all these fires take place? Give us a sense of where you are.
GAGLIANO: The fires took place in St. Landry Parish, which is a small parish just north of Lafayette. The two towns that it happened in are very close together - just minutes apart. The towns are Opelousas and Port Barre.
MARTIN: And where the churches were located - are these mainly rural areas? Were there people around?
GAGLIANO: So the churches where the fires happened are in rural areas, and that's one of the connecting factors between the fires. So the three churches were located on state highways in rural areas - you know, not too many people around, not many witnesses. And that's some of the talk that's happening about connections between these fires.
MARTIN: The fact that these are all historically African-American churches I would assume gives rise to some of that concern - I mean, given the fact that there's a history. Not just in Louisiana, but they may remember that in 1996, there was a spate of church fires. And this has happened in sort of other places. And I'm wondering whether that history is informing people's reactions to this in some way.
GAGLIANO: I think it definitely is. And race is part of the conversation around these fires. Now, of course, people are still trying to determine, were these churches targeted because they're historically African-American churches in this community? And that's something that we don't know yet, but it's definitely, I think, at the top of people's minds. And I was at a meeting of local pastors, including the three pastors of the churches that burned down, earlier this week on Thursday, and it's something they were discussing.
But at the same time, they were saying they're praying that this isn't race-based, that this is not the reason. They hope that no one in their community would do this for those reasons. You know, they're preparing themselves to face that if that's the case. But they're also trying not to stoke fear if that is not the case. So they're not at the point yet of saying they think this was a racist incident because they don't want to frighten their communities more than they already are. But if that is the result, they're ready to confront that as a group.
MARTIN: Could you talk a little bit more about what these churches mean to the community?
GAGLIANO: Of course. These churches have - like you said, have been around for over 100 years in these communities. I know two of the pastors said their churches have been around for 144, 146 years. People's families have attended these churches for generations. I saw, at the churches I visited, one church had a church cemetery immediately behind the building where the fire happened. People that were at the scene told me their family members are buried there. The pastor - this was at Greater Union Baptist - Reverend Harry Richard, his grandfather helped start the church. They have family buried on the grounds. I mean, these are places that have played roles in these families' lives for decades.
MARTIN: Did these congregations find places to meet today?
GAGLIANO: They did have places to meet today. I think two of the congregations were meeting in more kind of locally owned businesses. Another church, their pastor was also a pastor at another church in the community, and they were joining in with that congregation. So the local church community has been reaching out very heavily to these congregations to offer them places to pray, to worship, to continue having funerals, baptisms so that they can continue on as normal as they try to rebuild.
MARTIN: That's Katie Gagliano. She's a reporter with The Acadiana Advocate. She was kind enough to join us from Broussard, La.
Katie, thanks so much for talking to us.
GAGLIANO: Of course. Thank you.

Maryland High School Students Confront Male Behavior In #MeToo,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710867487/maryland-high-school-students-confront-male-behavior-in-metoo?station=KXJZ_FM,"Former Vice President Joe Biden has been called out for behavior that has made women uncomfortable. At a high school in Maryland, students are having similar discussions about their own behavior.
The national conversation about what constitutes appropriate behavior between men and women came to a high school in Maryland recently. Eighteen senior girls had been ranked by some of their male peers based on their looks. NPR's Eliza Dennis reports on what the girls did next.
ELIZA DENNIS, BYLINE: They call it the list, and it left many girls at the Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School upset, angry and ready for change. Paloma Delgado, a senior, was already organizing an event to address just this type of behavior. It was called the ABCs of Modern Masculinity - Raising Boys Without Lowering Expectations. And it couldn't have come at a better time.
(CHEERING)
PALOMA DELGADO: Thank you guys all so much for coming out.
DENNIS: Paloma ran part of the event from a high-top table in a local restaurant. It was packed. Students doubled up in armchairs and sat on the floor. With help from her family and a high school teacher, Paloma put together four and a half hours of student and guest speeches, a film screening and a panel discussion, all about boys and masculinity.
PALOMA: I think we need to hold them to a higher level of accountability because I think we can expect more from them.
DENNIS: The evening wasn't supposed to be that long. But when news of the list leaked, Paloma decided to add some speakers, including senior Virginia Brown.
VIRGINIA BROWN: I could have been ranked a 0.0 or a 10.0, and it wouldn't have made a difference to me. I think the...
DENNIS: Brown was on the list. At first, she was angry.
VIRGINIA: Because you feel so violated. I think you feel very - just gross being in your own body. I remember walking into class and seeing them. I just felt like I had to stay in my desk the whole period, like, sitting behind them so they couldn't see me because I just felt like everywhere I was, I was just being analyzed, like something I would do might bring me down to a lower ranking.
DENNIS: According to The Washington Post, which brought national attention to this story, the administration investigated the list and gave one male student one day of in-school detention.
VIRGINIA: We decided that in-school suspension for a day wasn't enough. They could just sit there. They could joke around. They would do their homework. And life would go on. And this would happen again.
DENNIS: Instead of calling the boys out, the students chose to call them in. They didn't demand that they not walk at graduation or miss prom. They chose to help them learn. And that process started even before Paloma's event. The school convened a meeting. For more than two hours, a group of girls and boys got together to discuss the list and how it made them feel. Nicola Schmidt was watching her male classmates' reactions.
NICOLA SCHMIDT: They went into the meeting first, you know, with a very negative attitude toward the whole situation and kind of like, this isn't our fault. This happens all the time. Like, why are we in trouble for this?
DENNIS: But, says Gabriela Jeliazkov, the mood changed quickly.
GABRIELA JELIAZKOV: So many girls shared their experiences with sexual harassment, with eating disorders, with catcalling and how it's an everyday part of their life. And a lot of people didn't even leave with dry eyes.
GREGORY SHANE: Before, I wasn't really thinking about this.
DENNIS: That's Gregory Shane (ph).
GREGORY: And I could even see how within my own behavior, there are times when I should have told my friends to stop.
DENNIS: And the girls said the meeting worked. A group of students, including some of those responsible for the list, are now working on a presentation to educate younger students about misogynistic behavior and how to address it. So the discussion is not over. And Nicola Schmidt says that's a good thing.
NICOLA: I think we couldn't have expected a better outcome because when the boys came out of the meeting after hearing our stories, they realized that this is so much more than just a list. It's about, like, a whole toxic culture that they were playing into and that, like, we had to live in.
DENNIS: Eliza Dennis, NPR News.

New Mexico Congresswoman Concerned That Border Patrol 'Is Not Quickly Adapting',www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710867473/new-mexico-congresswoman-concerned-that-border-patrol-is-not-quickly-adapting?station=KXJZ_FM,"Democratic Congresswoman Xochitl Torres Small, from New Mexico's 2nd District, tells NPR's Michel Martin how she thinks the government should address border security.
We're going to start the program today with another take on border security. And for that, we're going to turn to Democratic congresswoman Xochitl Torres Small. She represents New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District, and she sits on the House Homeland Security Committee. Now, she was part of that blue wave you heard so much about last November. She took an open seat that had been held for most of the last four decades by Republicans. But she and Republican Congressman Will Hurd of Texas recently introduced two pieces of bipartisan legislation meant to address challenges facing Customs and Border Protection. And Representative Torres Small is with us now.
Congresswoman, thank you so much for speaking with us.
XOCHITL TORRES SMALL: Michel, thank you so much for having me.
MARTIN: So, you know, the legislation you introduced with Republican Congressman Will Hurd focuses specifically on changes you think are necessary to be made to Customs and Border Protection. Now, you know, I think many people know that some of your colleagues on the Democratic side have called for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be abolished entirely.
Now, I think we can all agree that their perspective on this has been misunderstood. They're not saying that there shouldn't be any kind of border security at all. What they're saying is that the current arrangement, the current institutions aren't functioning and that they say we should, you know, scrap that and start over. But what do you say needs to be done?
TORRES SMALL: My concern with that approach is that there's a failure to be willing to work with everyone to find the right solutions. And there's a failure to be willing to identify that we do have to enforce our laws, and we have to enforce our laws in a way that reflects our values. So I think what we need to do is identify what our needs are along every stretch of our U.S.-Mexico border and find the right ways to fill them.
So that's why one of the first piece of legislation that I introduced with Congressman Will Hurd as well as Congressman Dan Crenshaw asks Customs and Border Protection to put together a recruitment and retention strategy for our rural areas because we lack the personnel that we need there. And it's hard to keep folks in these areas where they're most needed, especially as we see the changing flows and people who are voluntarily presenting, sometimes in these remote areas that lack that infrastructure and network - with health care providers, for example.
MARTIN: I understand that what you're saying is that there's a turnover problem in these areas. But is the issue here the turnover? Is the issue that there aren't enough people there to begin with?
TORRES SMALL: My concern is that there aren't people in the right places. And that's because it's harder to keep people. We've got that turnover problem in our most remote areas. I'm also concerned that CBP is not quickly adapting to these changing circumstances. For example, all of this discussion about a wall across the U.S.-Mexico border really doesn't focus on the fact that we're seeing more people voluntarily presenting along the border, and a wall would not be effective in addressing that.
Instead, we need to do things like have more immigration judges along the border to help clarify the asylum process and get to a quicker resolution. We need more people to help process these claims, and we need the technology to do so. Right now, there are places along the U.S.-Mexico border with such poor internet connection that it's making that processing time even longer. So if we looked at the resources that were really needed to face the problem now and took a bipartisan approach instead of trying to score political points against each other, I think we'd have a much better opportunity to address this situation.
MARTIN: Part of what I think I hear you saying, though, is that some of the entities working in that area don't have the right skillset for the problem that is actually there, which is that people who need - and I think what I hear you saying is you need social workers. And one of the reasons I raise that is one of the children who died, one of the migrant children who died in custody, in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection - you know, well, one of them came to the U.S. through your district, and one of the children died in your district. And a lot of people have raised questions about, you know, how that could have happened.
And what I - one of the things I think I hear you saying is perhaps the people who - to whom these children were presented didn't have the right skills to understand what was going on with them. Is that part of what's going on here?
TORRES SMALL: Michel, I think you're right. It's two separate things. We need the resources and the people with the skills necessary to process individuals who are voluntarily presenting. We also need the medical training necessary to do initial screenings and then to identify when it's necessary - not simply relying on parents' words, but when it's necessary to take someone to receive more care. We need to make sure that the facilities are better equipped to address those situations. And then we need to have enough agents who are able to do their job of stopping people who are trying to evade detection, which is still happening.
And folks are very concerned. Law enforcement that I've talked to are frustrated that they're not able to, one, do their job with the people who are voluntarily presenting and make sure that they have a safe place to be held and, two, that they're not able to identify other people who are trying to evade detection because they are so overburdened with the processing of people who are voluntarily presenting.
MARTIN: That is Representative Xochitl Torres Small. She represents New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District.
Congresswoman, thanks so much for talking with us. I hope this will be our first conversation, not our only conversation about this complicated topic.
TORRES SMALL: Michel, thanks so much for taking the time.

'Amazing Grace' Gets LA Premiere In Church Where It Took Place,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710247560/aretha-franklins-amazing-grace-gets-la-premiere-in-the-church-where-it-took-plac?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Viewers find their seats inside The New Temple Missionary Baptist Church for the LA screening of Amazing Grace.

Tim Greiving/NPR Nearly a half-century ago at a Baptist church in Watts, Calif., Aretha Franklin recorded Amazing Grace. The 1972 album went on to become the best-selling live gospel album and while those live sessions were filmed, the Queen of Soul did not want the concert film to be released. Forty seven years later, the documentary has been released and on March 31, the film had its West Coast premiere right in that same Baptist church where it took place.
It was an odd scene for a movie premiere; people all dressed up like they were going to church. But they were, in a sense. The New Temple Missionary Baptist Church is still a house of worship, although, the rows of pews used to be folding theater seats because the building started out as a movie theater.
For two nights in 1972, the church became a recording studio as the Queen of Soul returned to her gospel roots and sang to the Lord. Only 29 years old at the time, Franklin was at the pinnacle of her career.
Music Features Aretha Franklin Touches The Infinite In The Long-Delayed Film 'Amazing Grace' Music Features The Sound Made Flesh ""Against the better advice of her recording company, she decided to go back into the church and record a gospel album,"" Sabrina Owens, Aretha Franklin's niece, says.
Owens, who was 14 at the time, wasn't there those two nights. And like many, she didn't know that a young Sydney Pollack, who would later direct Tootsie and Out of Africa , was there. He was filming the entire event, which was hosted by Franklin's longtime mentor, himself a giant figure in gospel music, Reverend James Cleveland, the former minister of music at Aretha's father's church in Detroit.
Pollack captured the electric, soulful performance. He also captured the sweat on Franklin's face and audience members dancing in the aisles. He captured the experience of being there. Unfortunately, he failed to capture the film takes with a clapperboard, so it was impossible to synchronize the audio with the images.
""When you see it, then it's a different experience,"" producer Alan Elliott, who grew up obsessed with that album, explains. ""Because then you can see that James Cleveland breaks down in the middle of 'Amazing Grace' and starts crying, and has to leave the piano.""

Neon Before Pollack died of cancer in 2008, he gave Elliott his blessing to try to finish the film. Elliott mortgaged his own house to buy the negative from Warner Brothers without knowing about the synchronization issue. ""And so, there was this bipolarity to it,"" Elliot says. ""Which was: 'Oh my God, we have to start from scratch.' And then on the other side: 'Oh my God, we have all the footage.' Then, there was an opportunity, and that was really exciting.""
Fortunately, technological advancements enabled Elliott to sync the sound. He fashioned a 90-minute concert film with no narration, no interviews, just Aretha singing her heart out backed by the Reverend Cleveland and the Southern California Community Choir.
But there was another major obstacle: Aretha Franklin. The singer sued Elliott in 2011 to prevent a private screening and she stopped him from premiering the film at the Telluride Film Festival in 2015 , and again in 2016. No one really knows why she didn't want the film to come out, though after she died in August, her family was quick to green light the release.
""All the technical difficulties are fixed and when I saw it, it was such a moving and powerful experience, I thought that everybody deserved to see it,"" Owens says. ""And since Aretha did not have an issue with the content of the film, only other things, she would have loved this. And I think she would have wanted her fanbase to see it.""

Tim Greiving/NPR And so, on a cool spring night in Watts, the documentary team hosted a premiere of Amazing Grace right in The New Temple Missionary Baptist Church. The church has been retrofitted a little, but to Elliott, it's still a holy site. Even the big mural of Jesus in a river, which hovers over the choir throughout the concert film, is still there.
""The other day somebody asked me, 'What's the historical meaning of this church?'"" Elliot recalls. ""And I said, 'Well, you know, it's like what Mozart's church or Bach's church is, this is what this church is for gospel music.'""
Singer Eddie Kendrix was one of several people at the premiere who was there in 1972. ""I've known Aretha since she was like 13 years old,"" Kendrix says. ""She's always been bigger than life, so it was no mystery that all of this is going on. That's the type of talent she was.""
A number of original choir members, now with grayer hair and oxygen tanks, sat up front. Reverend Dr. Alexander Hamilton, who had directed the choir and arranged many of the songs, led his singers in two spirituals from a wheelchair. As the movie started, the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church once again became an Aretha Franklin concert and a church service all at once. ""You can't hardly listen to her without singing along,"" Kendrix says.

Tom Gjelten/NPR At a time when Americans are moving apart in their political and religious views, worshippers at White Memorial Presbyterian Church in Raleigh, N.C., have learned to avoid some subjects for the sake of maintaining congregational harmony.
""You wouldn't run up to a stove and touch a hot burner,"" says DeLana Anderson, a church deacon. ""So, I'm certainly not going to do that here.""
White Memorial is thriving, with about 4,000 members, while other mainline Protestant congregations are struggling. Just as impressively, it brings together worshippers with disparate political views, both red and blue.
""Raleigh is a purple city. North Carolina is a purple state,"" notes Christopher Edmonston, the church's senior pastor. ""Many of the people who have come to church here in the last 25 years are from other parts of the country, and they bring their ideas, their politics, their viewpoints, with them. So we almost have to be purple if we're going to continue to be open and welcome to any person that wants to come.""

toggle caption Tom Gjelten/NPR ""We're trying to build a community that puts into practice what it really means to love your neighbors,"" says Christopher Edmonston, White Memorial Presbyterian Church's senior pastor.
Tom Gjelten/NPR With that as its mission, White Memorial is fighting an uphill battle. A recent report by the Barna Group, a faith-based research organization, highlighted a growing tendency for people to seek ""communities that look and believe as they do"" and noted that the trend was especially evident among the most frequent churchgoers.
""One of the features we see in our research is that congregations aren't as politically diverse as they used to be,"" says Barna Group President David Kinnaman. ""That's not to say that they were ever bastions of political diversity, but at least there was a sense in which you could worship together with people who were very different from you politically.""
At White Memorial Presbyterian, Edmonston preaches often on the importance of civility, even when it means treading carefully around those subjects on which his congregants are likely to disagree.
Congregations aren't as politically diverse as they used to be.
David Kinnaman, president, Barna Group
""I absolutely bite my tongue sometimes,"" he says. ""There are things that I resist.""
Clergy often speak about the need to minister both in a ""pastoral"" manner, addressing the personal needs of their congregants, and in a ""prophetic"" manner, addressing their congregants' responsibilities in social, cultural and political settings.
In Edmonston's case, the hot-button issues have included North Carolina's ""bathroom bill,"" which limited gender-segregated restrooms to users with the corresponding biological sex, and state-imposed restrictions on voting rights.
""That's a place where I've tended to be more pastoral than prophetic,"" Edmonston says. ""And that's a choice I've got to live with, whether it's wise or not.""
Some of his more progressive congregants are ready to support Edmonston if he decides to be more outspoken politically.
""We're on the blue side of purple,"" says Anderson. ""I have a harder time being with people who are Trump supporters.""
I can't be part of a community if I'm not talking with and listening to people around me, especially those who feel differently than I do about religion or political issues.
Christopher Edmonston, senior pastor, White Memorial Presbyterian Church
""Sometimes I wish the church was more forceful,"" adds her husband, Scott. ""But Christopher is a dear friend and a wonderful pastor.""
It is a challenge that Edmonston has considered carefully.
""People are coming to our churches with their political ideas already formed,"" he says. ""That puts pastors in a precarious place, because when you speak against that, given the options for people to practice their Christian faith, they will simply go and find a place where the pastor will agree with them."" Under such circumstances, Edmonston says, discord inevitably takes the place of discourse, a trade-off he cites repeatedly in conversations, sermons and commentary.
""I can't be part of a community if I'm not talking with and listening to people around me, especially those who feel differently than I do about religion or political issues,"" he says. ""I'm not really part of the community if I'm only hearing the same voices over and over again.""
The Presbyterian way
The promotion of discourse over discord may strengthen civic culture in an era of political polarization, but for Edmonston, the mission is more a reflection of Presbyterian theology than it is a commitment to democratic process. By tradition, the denomination emphasizes the development of a worshiping community, whereas evangelical churches focus more on an individual's personal relationship with God.
""I think that's important,"" Edmonston says. ""I just don't emphasize it as much, because that's not the thrust I see in Scripture. The thrust in Scripture [to me] is, 'I'm calling you to be builders of the kingdom of God.' We're trying to build a community that puts into practice what it really means to love your neighbors and welcome them into our spaces.""
That welcoming approach includes a major commitment to children's and education programs plus extensive outreach activities, including weekly community suppers and a speakers series, all of which Edmonston says have contributed to his church's membership growth in recent years.
That growth has not come without difficulty, however.
LGBTQ issues the most problematic
In 2015, the Presbyterian Church (USA) informed local congregations that they would have to decide on their own whether to accommodate same-sex weddings. It was a question that White Memorial had previously managed to avoid and is one of the most difficult challenges a congregation can face.

Tom Gjelten/NPR ""I have never known a day in the church, from the day I was ordained in 1999 until that summer, when it wasn't an active conversation and an argument,"" says Edmonston.
Indeed, the Barna Group report found that Christian clergy rated LGBTQ-related issues as by far the most problematic of any they faced, with 44 percent of surveyed pastors saying they felt reluctant to speak about such issues, as opposed to just 18 percent who felt limited in speaking about abortion and 7 percent who had difficulty addressing questions about immigration and poverty.

When Presbyterian churches were informed in 2015 that they should decide on their own whether to accommodate same-sex marriages, no gay or lesbian members at White Memorial had yet asked to be married at the church. But Edmonston and other church leaders felt the congregation needed to address the question without reference to any particular request by a member, so as not to personalize the issue.
Rather than making an executive policy decision, Edmonston and the church's governing board (in Presbyterian terminology, a ""session"") sought to involve the congregation. A series of public meetings were scheduled, with speakers for and against same-sex marriage. Members with strong feelings, pro and con, were invited to send letters to the church leaders expressing their viewpoints. Most were opposed to a more inclusive wedding policy, according to Carol Vassey, a church elder who read all the letters and responded to each one personally.
""I wanted them to know that sometimes in our family, we agree to disagree,"" she says, ""but that I loved them and I cared how they felt. Some of the people came to the meetings trying to convince us that we were not looking at it correctly. Some just wanted to be heard.""
In those meetings, Vassey did not hide her own advocacy for a new church policy to allow same-sex weddings. ""I have a grandson who's gay,"" she says. ""I have a nephew who's gay. I have many friends who are gay. We're all children of God.""
Choosing to stay together
In the end, the church session voted to allow same-sex weddings, although the margin by which the measure passed was not announced and remains a secret to this day. Edmonston says it was for strategic reasons.
""If you would have reported that it was 56 to 2 for marriage inclusion, the people who didn't want it to happen would have gotten the message 'We really are out of step here.' And if we would have reported that the vote was 30 to 26, the people who were really for it may have thought, 'This place isn't as open-minded as I thought it was.' ""
In either case, congregational solidarity could have been damaged — the prospect Edmonston feared most. In his sermon on the Sunday following the vote, he pleaded with his congregation to stay united.
""If you were overjoyed by the session's conclusions, I humbly ask that you respect that there are others who are not there and some who might not ever get there,"" he said. ""If you are one of those who are dismayed, I ask you to remember that the strength of our congregation remains secure and that our love for one another and our devotion to this church family is greater than any single issue.""
National Finding 'Common Good' Among Evangelicals In The Political Season Among those who were troubled by the decision was Gregg Thompson, a former Republican member of the North Carolina legislature who was raised in what he calls ""a very conservative rural district"" of the state.
""Growing up Southern Baptist, I struggled with it,"" he says of the same-sex wedding issue. ""I had to do a lot of soul-searching and a lot of praying about it. But the way it was handled within our congregation helped put me at ease some.""
Thompson stayed at the church, but more than 40 members who opposed the same-sex wedding decision left for a more like-minded congregation.
""They did exactly what happens with a culture of discord,"" Edmonston says. ""They went to a place where there was someone who agreed with the position they had.""
We all come together in the grace of God.
Jim Brown, member of White Memorial Presbyterian Church
The loss of a few dozen members out of a congregation of more than 4,000 was a relatively minor development, however, and the process of working through the marriage decision may actually have left the church stronger.
One longtime White Memorial member who left, Jim Brown, later regretted his decision.
""We had a gentleman in our Sunday school class who really talked all of us into moving to another church,"" Brown recalls. ""And I got there, and I realized I just missed this church too much. So I came back.""
What brought him back was the very quality that the church staff has worked so hard to maintain: its strong sense of community.
""Now everybody is rallied back around, together,"" Brown says. ""I mean, [we're] probably closer as a church than I've ever seen us. We all come together in the grace of God.""
Edmonston acknowledges that his church's experience may not be easy for other congregations to emulate. The White Memorial membership is almost entirely white and upper middle class, so there may be fewer tensions in the church arising from racial and economic injustice.
Religion Provoked By Trump, The Religious Left Is Finding Its Voice ""Homogeneity certainly helps,"" he says. ""When you ask for civility, you have to be aware that some of the people you're calling to the table come with some pretty significant wounds.""
Against that reality, Edmonston is asked to make the case for civility as powerfully as he can.
""To me, it's always an argument for the long game,"" he promptly answers. ""No matter how right my position may be, if I tear you down while I'm making it, [if I say], 'I'm right, you're wrong, you're stupid,' at the end of that, you and I still have to be neighbors. We still have to live with each other, once the votes are counted."""

NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Congressman Joaquin Castro about the resignation of Kirstjen Nielsen, the director of the Department of Homeland Security.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Now we're going to address the breaking news out of Washington. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position. President Trump tweeted this information a short time ago. To talk more about this, we've called Representative Joaquin Castro. He's a Democratic congressman from Texas. He represents much of San Antonio, not far from the U.S.-Mexico border. And he's with us now. Congressman Castro, thank you so much for joining us once again.
JOAQUIN CASTRO: Yeah. Thanks for having me.
MARTIN: What's your reaction to this news that Secretary Nielsen is leaving?
CASTRO: Well, you know, I thought that she should have resigned before when she was not honest with Congress about the plan to separate families some time ago. She also was not honest when she came in front of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which I chair. And I asked her the question very directly whether she had any knowledge of children who had died or been seriously injured in the government's custody, and she said no. And it turned out that wasn't true. So she leaves behind a very tortured legacy of separating families, the remain in Mexico policy, just last week where the - Commissioner McAleenan, who's now apparently going to be the acting secretary, they literally staged a press conference where they had women and children behind fences with razor wire.
And so it's a very troubled legacy. And now, I got to say about her, I really think that anybody that comes within President Trump's realm that's doing immigration is going to get sucked into doing it the way that he does it. So I'm not saying that the things I described were all her ideas, but she certainly stepped up to take the job. And I think history will show that she was part of these very ugly policies.
MARTIN: President Trump has been signaling some kind of change over the last week - and the last couple of days, certainly - where he pulled his nominee for Customs and Border Protection for the head of that agency, saying he wants to go in a, quote, unquote, ""tougher"" direction. How do you interpret that? What do you think he means by that?
CASTRO: Well, I mean, you see what they're doing. You know, as I mentioned, that press conference where they staged those folks behind chain link fences and razor wire, having them sleep on the ground for three or four nights or whatever it was. And the thing about that policy is that he has tried to convince us that if, as a nation, we just get crueler in terms of how we treat migrants, that less people will try to come here. But the exact opposite has happened. There are more people trying to come here. So his policy is a total failure. And I don't see how getting meaner or crueler is going to help.
MARTIN: Do you have any concerns at all about making this change in the middle of this surge at the border? I understand, I mean, of course you've made it very clear that you disagree with his policies. You've also made it clear that you think some of his policies are in part responsible for what we're seeing at the border. But do you have any concerns about this what seems to be a complete shakeup at the top of this agency in the middle of this situation?
CASTRO: Yeah. I mean, you ask a good question. And honestly, I hadn't thought about that. We just got the news. But, I mean, look. I think Donald Trump, of all of the different policy areas that we deal with in the federal government - education, health care, immigration, so forth - I think this is the one that he probably pays attention to the most. And this is the area where he's most in control or the people close to him are most in control. So I think anybody that comes in and takes that job is essentially going to be absolutely marching to Donald Trump's drumbeat.
MARTIN: I understand that this is very new news. We're just learning of this ourselves as well. I just wonder if you have any sense of whether Secretary Nielsen was pushed or did she jump herself and does that matter? Does it matter whether she resigned or whether she was fired?
CASTRO: You know, to be honest, probably not. You know, I had conversations with Republican colleagues in Congress over the last several months who say that they've known her personally and that she's not the person that is described in the media, that she's not this cold-hearted person who's, you know, trying to inflict pain on migrants. But look, at the end of the day, if you take a job that calls for you to do that and enact these policies, then you're on the hook for what this administration does.
And so, you know, and I have to agree with them to some point that, before all of this before, she was part of the Trump administration, there wasn't necessarily an indication that she was malicious towards people. But like I said, she's been part of what is going to go down in history as a very, very disturbing period in our nation's history in terms of how we treat people.
MARTIN: Well, to your point that the policies are what are relevant now, do you have any plans to call Secretary Nielsen before you again for any reason? Do you have any questions for her that she can now answer because she's no longer a part of the administration?
CASTRO: Oh, sure. I mean, we would - she had agreed to go and come in front of the Hispanic Caucus again. And of course now she's resigning or leaving her job. So I don't - we don't have subpoena power, so I don't know that she'll end up doing that. But I absolutely think that the Homeland Security Committee and the Judiciary Committee - they absolutely should try to bring her back and ask her questions that, you know, that we all still have about the situation.
MARTIN: But like what? Give me just - we have 30 seconds left. What is one question that you have for her that you'd like to hear her answer?
CASTRO: Well, we still don't know why these families were separated without a system to track them. There still is no answer to that, and the government is saying it's going to take two years to finally reunite the families that were separated.
MARTIN: That is Congressman Joaquin Castro. He's a Democrat from Texas. Congressman, thank you so much for talking to us.

Atem talked about his life as a ""Lost Boy"" and what happened when he settled in Michigan — like the time his foster mom grounded him just for wanting to punch a kid who'd insulted him. Brennen Jensen for NPR
Baltimore's Stoop Stories is a 12-year-old live show and podcast wherein people from all walks of life tell their tales. The premise is simple: Everyone has a story.
But then few have one as horrific, heartbreaking — and ultimately inspiring — as the one told by Jacob Atem, who was born in the part of Sudan that is now the independent country of South Sudan and who is currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's Center for Humanitarian Health.
""I always ask people in this country, when was the last time you drank your own urine?"" he inquired from the Stoop Story stage on October 25. ""We didn't have an option but to drink our own urine.""
Atem is a former Lost Boy, one of some 40,000 children orphaned by the Sudanese civil war in the 1990s. They fled the country on foot via arduous cross-country treks and spent years in refugee camps. Nearly 4,000 were ultimately resettled in the U.S.
His ""beautiful life"" in a small village on the banks of the Nile River came to an end when he was around 7. He and his cousin were tending the family cattle when North Sudanese militia struck the town. His parents were killed, his sister and nieces enslaved. The boys hid in the woods and soon fell in with a ragtag group of other boys who'd escaped the carnage, now walking out of the country. If a lack of sufficient food and water weren't privation enough, militia forces pursued the boys, even bombing them from helicopters.
""The wild animals were also very vicious, especially the lions, and a lot of people got attacked,"" Atem told a hushed audience at Baltimore's historic Senator Theater. ""A lot of people got eaten by crocodiles.""
He walked over 2,000 miles. But life was little better after reaching the Kakuma refugee camp in the Kenyan desert. ""In this camp, you're literally waiting for your death,"" he said. Malnutrition rendered him temporarily blind at times. Then hope came from the other side of the world when he was 15.
""In 2001, I was resettled to a place called Michigan,"" he recalled. YouTube
The theme for the evening's stories was, ""Getting it wrong: stories about mix-ups, misunderstandings, and mistakes."" Atem came to Michigan with a pair of his cousins, and the cow-herding Sudanese boys had more than a few misunderstandings about life in 21st-century America.
""Language was difficult. When we see this sign that said 'Dead End' with our little English, we say, 'Wow, you go there, you will never die again.' They also got blissfully acquainted with something called pizza.
But then, during his sophomore year of high school, this: ""One morning, my foster mom just dropped me off at the school bus. This kid sitting next to me said, 'Hey, what's up, monkey?' You should have seen my eyes. I grabbed the kid. I wanted to punch him because that's how we did it in Africa. Fortunately, my nephew was there. He pulled me back and he said not to do it."" A 'Lost Boy' And Former Child Soldier From Sudan Goes To Hollywood
Atem had learned to fight in the refugee camp. It was how you survived. Now the traumatized 16-year-old stewed in his anger. Worse still, when he got home his foster mother (""a wonderful woman"") grounded him for just for wanting to punch the other boy. He cried himself to sleep.
A night of soul-searching led him to a new strategy: technology over knuckles. ""I started having a tape recorder,"" he explained. ""People would call me monkey, the 'n' word, you name it and I would record that and give it to the principal. The student would be punished or actually suspended for the foul language they used.""
A corner was turned. ""I went and graduated, got my bachelors, masters and now am a postdoc at Johns Hopkins."" He also co-founded the Southern Sudan Healthcare Organization , a nonprofit working within his war-torn homeland.
He finished up by saying: ""To conclude: I just want to say that the decision I made of nonviolence has had a long-term positive outcome.""
We caught up with Jacob Atem after the show to find out more about his refugee experience and his thoughts on the current political climate. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Are you in touch with your sister or other relatives in Sudan or South Sudan?
My sister and two of my nieces were taken during the war into slavery. I was last in contact with them in 2013, and then the war erupted again. So, right now I'm trying to trace them through the International Red Cross. It's been difficult given the unstable environment. Also, I have a half-brother who is a chief in my clan and I have two half-sisters who I have been in contact with. Also, a brother who went to Australia as a Lost Boy.
Do you feel Americans remember much about the Lost Boys and their plight?
People actually remember pretty well. There was a movie about us. They know the lost boys arrived here, but they don't really know what happened to us.
I am happy to report now that the Lost Boys are married with families. The Lost Boys are fighting in Iraq with the American military. Lost Boys are captains in the Air Force and engineers working on the Boeing 787. A Lost Boy friend of mine works for NASA. And a Lost Boy is doing postdoc work at John Hopkins. Those are the stories that Americans can be proud of it because it's America that made us who we are.
Did some Lost Boys have less exemplary outcomes?
Yes, there were some who struggled adjusting to America. Some did have trouble with the law. When we first got here, a lot of us were diagnosed with PTSD. That's doesn't justify whatever crimes they did but it's part of the baggage we came with — depression, anxiety. It was a struggle for some.
Has our charged political climate motivated you to tell your story more?
You bet. My dream is to have a dialogue on immigration. I'm ready to share my story, to get invited to speak — whether it's at the White House or wherever it is. I think it is time for the refugees, also, to understand the perspective of those with opposite views. This is where I pray to have leadership that can embrace dialogue.
There are some bad apples who may have damaged the reputation of the refugees. I'm not denying that. But the focal point here is that we sit down and see the big picture. What refugees want is to come to this country, work hard, get their education and give back to society as I did. Twenty years ago, America was a role model for the free world. It doesn't matter if you're Democrat or Republican. You know how the Lost Boys got here? It was a bipartisan agreement. Those are the days that I'm dreaming about.
What troubles you most about the refugee/asylum situation in the U.S.?
I never thought I would see, in my life as a refugee, a country that was separating children from their parents. I just cannot imagine it. My parents and 2.5 million people were killed in the Sudan civil war. But if they had not been killed and were with me when we went to Ethiopia or Kenya, I could never imagine that they would be separated from me. That's where my heart melts.
The world faces the greatest number of displaced people since the end of World War II. Are you optimistic that the U.S. will become more welcoming?
I think we can bridge the gap and reverse course. It's not too late. It's quite challenging, but it can be reversed because some of these are temporary political campaigns from opportunistic politicians taking advantage of what I call a misunderstanding between American people and refugees or immigrants.
The beautiful thing about this country is if you don't like it, change it through the vote.
Are you in touch with that boy who called you the name? It seems that the encounter, painful as it was, proved to be a pivotal moment in your development.
That is true. I don't know where he is. I know his name, but I haven't seen him for a while.
Why did you choose a career in humanitarian health?
This is one of my favorite questions. Coming here, after drinking urine and eating mud and in a terrible condition, I felt really truly blessed with what we have in this country. I thought it would be good to not be selfish and to help people back.
I went to study biology to become a doctor, so I can help people in general. But it didn't work out. Then I remembered that when I was young, I had a big wound and I could see my own bones. I remember how vulnerable children are. A lot of refugees around me were dying from diarrheal diseases, from preventable diseases. So I went and did my master's in public health, and I fell in love with a profession where I could couple my experience of living as a refugee with scientific research.

South Sudan's Peace Agreement: Will It Stick&quest;,www.npr.org,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2018/11/08/665386800/will-south-sudans-new-peace-agreement-hold-this-time,"Enlarge this image

Tens of thousands of South Sudanese cheered, paraded and danced around the grounds of the John Garang Memorial Park in the capital city ofJuba last week, celebrating a fresh peace deal. It was a striking change of mood for a country that has seen little joy in the past five years, ripped apart by a civil war that has displaced millions and left hundreds of thousands dead.
Rebel leader, Riek Machar, who once served as the country's vice president, had flown back from exile and took the stage last Thursday along with South Sudan's president, Salva Kiir. The arch rivalry between these two men has fueled the civil war in South Sudan.
But suddenly, and without much buildup, these battle-hardenedfoes walked up to each other during the peace ceremony,shook hands and smiled. Warring Parties Sign Cease-Fire In South Sudan
""I want to reiterate that the war in South Sudan has come to an end,"" Kiir declared. He promised that he has forgiven Machar and that Machar has forgiven him. ""To forgive,"" he told the crowd, ""is not an act of cowardice. It is a Christian obligation.""
Still , South Sudan has been in very similar circumstances multiple times,over the years, and each time, without fail, peace deals and ceasefires have crumbled. So, amid the ebullience, an uncomfortable question remains: Will this peace deal be any different?
Kiir insists yes — this time, peace will stick. South Sudanese are tired of war, he says, and foes have for the first time come to an agreement of their own free will.
To underscore his resolve, the presidentordered theimmediate release of two of South Sudan's most prominent political prisoners: James Gatdet, a former spokesman for Machar, and William Endley, a former colonel in the South African military who served as an adviser to Machar and spent more than two years in prison because of it.
A history of broken peace deals
In 2011, after a brutal war for independence from Sudan, South Sudan became the world's newest nation. It didn't take long, however, for President Kiir to accuse his first vice president — Machar — of fomenting a coup. By 2013, the new country was embroiled in its own civil war.
The international community stepped in and brokered a peace deal in the summer of 2015. In essence, the deal called for all belligerents to return to their barracks and for Machar, who had been forced into exile, to once again become vice president.
To jubilation, Machar returned to South Sudan's capital city in the spring of 2016. But, by summer of that year, war broke out again in Juba and Machar was again forced into exile.
To Lauren Blanchard, who studies South Sudan for the Congressional Research Service, Machar's return last week felt a lot like 2016.
""I'm not optimistic about this deal,"" Blanchard says. The deal is vague, she points out, in terms of how security will be maintained in the capital once Machar returns for good next spring. And it's not clear what role the United Nations peacekeeping mission will play, or how the guarantors of the deal — Sudan and Uganda — would enforce it. 'Unimaginable' Suffering In South Sudan. Is There Any Hope?
""Also,"" she says, ""the ground is a lot more complicated than in 2016.""
Back then, Kiir controlled the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and Machar controlled the Sudan People's Liberation Army In Opposition (SPLA-IO). Today, South Sudan has additional militarygroups that are not even included in this peace deal.
One of those groups, the South Sudan Opposition Alliance (SSOA) is led by Thomas Cirilo Swaka, a general who defected from the government. SSOA controls swaths of the country, including some urban territory, and has refused to sign the deal.
""We long for peace but we want a genuine peace,"" says Kwaje Lasu, the spokesman for the SSOA. ""Right now, nothing has changed. The cessation of hostilities has been violated left and right — and we will exercise our right to protect our territory.""
The current peace deal only addresses the conflicts among the elites, Lasu says, and doesn't take on the bigger issues — especially ""justice and accountability."" Even though Kiir has declared peace in South Sudan, Lasu points out, the millions of people displaced from their homes don't trust that it is safe to return.
Aly Verjee, who served as an adviser on the 2016 dealand is now a researcher at the United States Institute of Peace, says that trust and tolerance will be key to any lasting peace.
He says beyond the minutiae of this deal (such asthe deadlines for when Machar will become vice president again), a big test for lasting peace will be whether there truly has been an underlying change in attitude. Will the government, for example, now tolerate differing views? Or will the ruling leaders arrest or kill someone for expressing a critique?
""A lot of good sentiments [have been] expressed,"" Verjee says. ""And the indications of a change are there.""
Optimism from surprising corners
If there is anyone who has a right to be wary of the prospect of peace in South Sudan, it is William Endley, the South African adviser to Machar who, along with the rebel leader's former spokesman, James Gatdet, spent more than two years in prison.
In a lot of ways, Gatdet and Endley had become symbolic of the conflict in South Sudan. When the previous peace deal collapsed in 2016, they were the spoils — captured, charged with treason and then, earlier this year, sentenced to death by hanging.
But last week, the two men were pardoned by President Kiir. Andtwo days after his conciliatory speech they were both released.
Gatdet was flown to Khartoum and Endley was deported to South Africa.
I reached Endley by phone in Cape Town. He says he remains ""optimistic"" about the chances for lasting peace.
Machar first hired Endley because of his experience helping to integrate the South African Defense Force. Back in 2016, after the signing of the old peace deal, Endley was in Juba advising Machar about how South Sudan's disparate forces might come to some reconciliation.
But Endley hadonly been in Juba weeks when he saw the collapse of the 2016 peace deal and watched as Machar was driven out of the capital and into exile.
Today, Endley says, the atmosphere around the current peace agreement seems totally different to him. Back in 2016, he says, ""tension was in the air"" the minute Machar landed in Juba.
""It was only a question of time before something happened,"" he says.
In contrast, the leaders and the people of South Sudan today seem to have a clear-eyed view of the ""harsh reality"" of their country, Endley believes. 'Other Nobel' Goes To Amazingly Humble Surgeon In South Sudan
The civil war that lasted more than five years has displaced millions of people and killed hundreds of thousands . It has decimated the country's oil infrastructure. And 6.1 million people — more than half the population — don't have enough food . Also, the leaders at the center of this conflict have lost legitimacy on the world stage.
So, Endley believes, the leaders and the people may now understand that peace is the only viable alternative for the country's survival.
To him, this feels like rock bottom, and the perfect time for everyone to come clean: acknowledge the killings and overreactions, release political prisoners and begin reconciliation.
""I believe ... the actual truth needs to come out now — and the healing process can start properly,"" Endley says. ""Because, you know, bad news does not get any better with time.""
Endley's stint in the Blue House, South Sudan's notorious national security prison, actually imbued him with even more hope for the future of the country, he says.
""You know, the average South Sudanese is the reason I'm still alive, still capable of talking,"" Endley says. ""My health is improving because of my fellow detainees and some of the people inside the Blue House who took care of me — when I was, literally, busy dying more than once on the floor. So I am very positive about South Sudan.""
And, if he is ever given the chance, Endley says, there is no doubt in his mind — he will return."

Thousands of protesters took to the streets in Sudan Friday in the latest wave of anti-government demonstrations that have taken place for more than two weeks.
Police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators who gathered after noon prayers in the capital city of Khartoum, The Associated Press reports . Protesters demanded the upheaval of the country's military regime, chanting ""freedom, peace, justice"" and carrying banners with the Arabic command for ""leave.""
Similar protests filled streets across the country, from the Red Sea city of Port Sudan to Atbara, where the first demonstrations took place on Dec. 19.
Sparked by rising prices after the government announced it would end bread subsidies, as NPR's Eyder Peralta reports , the protests have become an outpouring of anger toward President Omar al-Bashir, who has ruled the country for nearly three decades. Upset Over Rising Prices, Protesters In Sudan Take To The Streets
""It's not about economics,"" a protester named Wael told NPR. ""It's about — They are not going to improve the country. I am 25 years old. I cannot see my future here inside this country.""
At least 19 demonstrators have died, according to a United Nations estimate from a week ago, a result of escalating violence by Sudan's security forces. Amnesty International reported a higher estimate of at least 37 people shot and killed. U.N. officials raised concerns about arbitrary arrests and called for an investigation into the violence.
Bread prices have skyrocketed along with inflation, and shelves are bare, as Peralta reports. Economic insecurity has plagued Sudan since the oil-producing southern third of the country seceded in 2011, becoming South Sudan. Meanwhile, perceived mismanagement and corruption in the military government have raised tensions.
""Life is hard is what he's saying,"" said Peralta, of the young Sudanese man. ""But he feels like the government does have the resources and they're just misusing it. They're looking out for themselves, he says, so President Omar al-Bashir has to go.""
Protesters in previous days have chanted what translates to, ""The people demand the fall of the regime,"" in echoes of protests that toppled governments across the Middle East and North Africa during the Arab Spring.
Sudanese people also took to the in 2011 streets to protest rising prices and political repression, and they were met with a sharp crackdown by Bashir. Sparks of unrest in 2013 followed a similar pattern.
""Analysts I've spoken to say this is a bit different,"" Peralta says. ""There [are] a lot more people on the streets, and this seems like an emboldened protest movement. Across the country, we've seen reports that protesters have attacked government buildings.""
So-called ""bread protests"" have broken out sporadically for the past few years in Sudan, including last year, when the government similarly announced it would eliminate bread subsidies. The latest protests have primarily demanded the resignation of Bashir, rather than the renewal of subsidies. But anti-government sentiments and food riots have gone hand-in-hand throughout recent history in the Middle East and North Africa.
In 1977, thousands of Egyptians rose up in the country's ""bread riots"" that left dozens dead. Crowds of students gathered around the Egyptian Parliament, chanting ""Sayed Marei, millionaire"" in reference to the wealth of the Parliament's speaker, as The Washington Post reported at the time.
In Jordan, protests broke out over food prices in 1989 and again in 1996, when protesters set fire to government buildings and called for the removal of the prime minister.
In response to Sudanese protests, President Bashir has promised economic measures that include continued subsidies on basic food items and an increase in wages, but he has not offered details, AP reports . He has also blamed the protests on agents and infiltrators looking to exploit the country's economic hardships.
Bashir has governed Sudan since a military coup in 1989 toppled the country's last freely elected leader. The International Criminal Court indicted Bashir in 2010 for genocide and crimes against humanity committed in Darfur."

Some of Sudan's biggest protests in decades are demanding that President Omar al-Bashir step down. A song written for an earlier time of discord has emerged as the protesters' anthem.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
For more than two months now, protests have raged in Sudan. People are calling for an end to the three-decade rule of President Omar al-Bashir. The anthem of their moment is a song written for an earlier time of discord. NPR's Eyder Peralta has the story.
EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Everyone was stunned when the late, great Sudanese singer Mohammed Wardi brought a new song to a performance space at the Hague. It usually took Wardi years to compose a song. Yet, this one he'd written quickly.
(SOUNDBITE OF MOHAMMED WARDI SONG, ""SURRENDER"")
PERALTA: He played ""Surrender."" It was simple, a plaintive song that obviously tied directly to his own life. Wardi was exiled from Sudan after Omar al-Bashir took over after a military coup in 1989. To Mostapha Sid Ahmed, a Sudanese music fan whose father was an exiled opposition leader, this was a song ahead of its time.
MOSTAPHA SID AHMED: It was talking about freedom, about a dictator who should surrender and give everything back to the people
PERALTA: This was 1997. President Bashir was just eight years into power. So Wardi sang the song just a few times in concert and only left this ragged recording.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SURRENDER"")
MOHAMMED WARDI: (Singing in Arabic).
PERALTA: But over the decades, the lyrics stuck in Sid Ahmed's head. And he couldn't help but think about the song these past two months as he watched young people take to the streets demanding democracy and accountability, demanding a better life and facing off with security forces.
SID AHMED: So it came back to my mind that, like, this is exactly what he described.
PERALTA: Sid Ahmed, a businessman in Dubai, called his sister, Zoozita, and one of Wardi's old guitarists, all of them in exile in the UAE. And he got them together in a studio. He played them the old song and told them it was time to contribute to the protest movement.
(SOUNDBITE OF MOHAMMED WARDI SONG, ""SURRENDER"")
PERALTA: He told them...
WARDI: Your guitar is your weapon. Your voice is your weapon. And that's what could reach the whole world, not just the people inside.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SURRENDER"")
ZOOZITA: (Singing in Arabic).
PERALTA: The song is a classic protest anthem. The waves are coming for you. The people are marching, and they are saying selim, surrender.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SURRENDER"")
ZOOZITA: (Singing in Arabic).
PERALTA: Zoozita, the singer, says what came out of her was pain and hope - pain for all the people who have been killed in clashes with security forces, but hope that maybe all of this will make a difference.
ZOOZITA: We've seen many videos of people get shot in the head and in the chest. And you feel people are - they are not afraid of anything.
PERALTA: The song mirrors that sentiment. It begins with mournful verses, but it builds into a fearless confrontation with a dictator.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SURRENDER"")
ZOOZITA: (Singing in Arabic).
PERALTA: Surrender - surrender our power, our books, our lights, our mosques and give us back our heritage.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SURRENDER"")
ZOOZITA: (Singing in Arabic).
PERALTA: But the last time this song was released, it made no difference. President Omar al-Bashir was charged with genocide by the International Criminal Court for ordering the massacre of his own people in Darfur, yet he has remained in power. Zoozita says this time it feels different. It's not just the song but the thousands of young people - the women, the poor, the professionals - who have taken to the streets, saying enough is enough.
ZOOZITA: This time there are many things that tells you that a change is going to happen.
PERALTA: As the song warns, Bashir's time is over.

Eighteen years ago, Lorrie Triplett's husband, Ensign Andrew Triplett, rode off on his bike to board the destroyer USS Cole, heading for the Persian Gulf. It was the last time she would see him. On Wednesday, she sat in the U.S. Supreme Court and ""really wanted to scream.""
Her husband was among 17 killed in 2000 when al-Qaida suicide bombers in a small boat attacked the Cole while it was refueling in a harbor in Yemen. Dozens more men and women were injured. They and the families of the dead sued the government of Sudan for allegedly providing material support for the attack.
Their path for this and similar suits has been long and difficult, and now, to the consternation of the victims and veterans groups, the Trump administration is siding with Sudan, long designated a state sponsor of terrorism. Remembering The USS Cole, A Decade After The Naval Destroyer Was Attacked
Sorry, wrong address
The government argues that the $315 million in damages awarded to the victims in the case cannot stand. The legal question is one that only a lawyer could love, but not the people whose lives have been affected. The question is whether the notification of the lawsuit was sent to the wrong address.
The notice was sent by registered mail to the Embassy of Sudan in Washington, D.C., addressed to the nation's foreign minister and signed for by someone at the embassy.
Sudan contends that under U.S. law and international treaty, the notice should have been sent to the Foreign Ministry in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. That position was supported by the Obama administration in 2015, at an earlier stage of the litigation. Now, at the Supreme Court, it is also supported by Saudi Arabia, which faces similar lawsuits over the Sept. 11 attacks. Sudan Ordered to Pay $7.96 Million for USS Cole Attack
The argument is that to allow such notifications to be made at an embassy would breach the ""inviolability"" of embassies and consulates that is guaranteed under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
The government argues as well that if Sudan and other countries can be served notice of lawsuits at embassies, the U.S. could suffer a similar fate at its embassies.
But lawyers for the Cole victims counter that the U.S. has a firm policy of never accepting such legal service at its embassies and that the U.S. has not had any difficulty enforcing that policy over a period of more than four decades.
On Wednesday, when the case was argued, a grim group of Cole survivors and relatives of the dead sat in the chamber.
Tears and anger
Lorrie Triplett, the widow of Ensign Triplett, was shaking when she emerged. Tears poured down her face as she talked about her loss and that of her daughters. Even today, she said, she cannot believe ""how drastic"" the effect has been on her life. ""Never got his body back,"" she said softly. ""Never. Never seen him ever again.""
The men who stood next to Triplett were angry. ""Our own country, siding with the country that harbors terrorists,"" said David Matthew Morales, who was injured on the Cole. ""It was very hurtful,"" he added, pulling a small piece of metal out of his pocket. It was from the hull of the Cole, and he carries it with him everywhere.
""We came here for accountability, and we wouldn't expect our government to oppose its citizens receiving justice and holding those accountable for a terrorist attack,"" said Jamal Gunn, whose brother was killed on the Cole.
""Our country should stand behind their soldiers and sailors that's out there every day putting their life on the line for the country,"" said Rick Harrison, a firefighter and machinist injured on the Cole.
""You can look at 9/11. They got justice. ... So why can't the USS Cole get justice?"" asked David Francis, whose sister was killed on the Cole.
The justices pile on
Inside the court chamber, the justices appeared at first dismissive of Sudan's argument.
""If I wanted to mail something"" to the head of a department in a foreign country, said Chief Justice John Roberts, ""my first thought"" would be to deliver it to the embassy.
Justice Samuel Alito opined that when he was on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, and his office was in Newark, N.J., mail meant for him was often sent to the court headquarters in Philadelphia, and then forwarded to him.
""Everybody understands,"" said Justice Elena Kagan, that embassies are ""the point of contact if you want to do anything with respect to a foreign government."""

Rising prices, shortages of basics and growing frustration with Sudan's long-serving president have fueled a week of anti-government protests that are spreading across the country.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
This is what the past week has sounded like across the northeast African country of Sudan.
(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: (Foreign language spoken).
GREENE: Protesters have been on the streets by the thousands demanding the ouster of an 3-three-decade-old regime. And the government has responded with violence. Human rights groups say at least 37 people have been killed. NPR's Eyder Peralta has been following this story from his post in Nairobi.
Hi, Eyder.
EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Hey, David.
GREENE: So let's start with why people are in the streets in Sudan. This has to do with food, right?
PERALTA: It does. It started over the price of bread. The government decided to end subsidies, and the price of bread tripled overnight. But this really speaks to the huge economic problems faced by Sudan. This is a country that is still reeling from the loss of most of its oil revenue when South Sudan became independent. So the country has seen inflation go through the roof. People can't get cash; they make hours' worth of lines for $20. And then they get to the stores, and the shelves are bare. But look. Today I was talking to Wael (ph), who's a protester in the capital, Khartoum, who only wanted his first name used because he's afraid of the government. And here's what he told me.
WAEL: It's not about economics. It's about - they are not going to improve the country. I am 25 years old. I cannot see my future here inside this country.
PERALTA: So life is hard is what he's saying. But he feels like the government does have the resources and they're just misusing it. They're looking out for themselves, he says, so President Omar al-Bashir has to go.
GREENE: I just listen to that. I mean, it's a young voice we have heard from so many countries in the world, someone demanding more of their government. And you have Omar al-Bashir in power for, as we said, some 30 years - a strong man. I mean, could this be the end of his rule there?
PERALTA: Let me play you something that will explain a lot.
(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting in foreign language).
PERALTA: So that's what people across Sudan are chanting. And it translates roughly to - the people demand the fall of the regime. And if you remember, that was a hugely popular chant during the Arab Spring.
GREENE: Sure.
PERALTA: And the Sudanese, they took to the streets back then, too. And since 2011, people have taken to the streets. And every single time, the security forces have managed to tamp these protests down. Analysts I've spoken to say this is a bit different. There is a lot more people on the streets, and this seems like an emboldened protest movement. Across the country, we've seen reports that protesters have attacked government buildings. And one more thing that's good to remember is that popular protest movements have brought down two governments in Sudan, once in 1964 and again in 1985.
GREENE: But Eyder, besides sending police out on the streets and causing people to die and be injured, has the government actually said anything about trying to improve people's lives?
PERALTA: So President Omar al-Bashir delivered a speech a few days ago, but he blamed everyone else. He said that the protests were part of agents and mercenaries and infiltrators who are just trying to exploit these economic hardships. We've also seen some reports that the troops who have been sent to deal with protesters have instead sided with them. So that's something really important to watch. But the military has officially issued a statement that they are 100 percent with President al-Bashir.
GREENE: Eyder, Thanks a lot.
PERALTA: Thank you, David.

'Every Kind Of Norm Is Broken': U.N. Says Brutality In S. Sudan May Rise To War Crimes,www.npr.org,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/02/21/696581068/as-un-looks-into-war-crimes,"A man carries South Sudan's national flag at Mangateen Internal Displaced persons center in Juba on November 17, 2018.

Human rights violations and abuses that have grown routine against civilians and children in the world's youngest country, may constitute war crimes, according to a new report by the U.N.'s Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan outlining acts of brutality committed in 2018.
Nearly eight years after South Sudan gained independence from its northern neighbor, Sudan, a civil war has mired the country in a humanitarian disaster. Why The Famine In South Sudan Keeps Getting Worse
""There is a confirmed pattern of how combatants attack villages, plunder homes, take women as sexual slaves and then set homes alight – often with people in them,"" said Commission Chair Yasmin Sooka in a statement about the report's findings, which covers 2018. ""Rapes, gang rapes, sexual mutilation, abductions and sexual slavery, as well as killings, have become commonplace in South Sudan.""
The report does not name perpetrators, but says they are believed to come from many sides of the conflict including the army, rebel and armed groups, the National Security Service, as well as two unidentified state governors.
A ceasefire was declared in South Sudan in June, 2018, followed by the signing of a peace deal, which resulted in a marked decrease in fighting. However, ""hostilities have persisted,"" the reports says, adding that the peace deal also did not address South Sudan's disastrous humanitarian situation. ""Due in large part to the conflict, 60 percent of the South Sudanese population is severely food insecure, and there remain 2.2 million refugees and 1.9 million internally displaced persons."" Unhappy Anniversary, South Sudan
Children make up the majority of South Sudan's displaced. They are often alone — separated from their parents and especially vulnerable to violence. Armed groups have recruited thousands of South Sudanese child soldiers, the reports says, while more children are still being abducted and forced to fight.
Sometimes children are caught in the crossfire of ongoing military operations and sometimes they are targeted, the Commission finds. It recounts reports of remarkable brutality, including children being shot in the back as they try to run away, and in one case, a baby being swung against a tree.
Sexual and gender-based violence is an ongoing tactic of warfare used ""by all parties to sow terror,"" the report says. Sexual violence against children includes the rape of girls as young as seven. Boys and men also suffer, but their stories of sexual violence are under-reported, due to social stigma, the report finds. Will South Sudan's New Peace Agreement Hold This Time?
""There is no doubt that these crimes are persistent because impunity is so entrenched in South Sudan that every kind of norm is broken even raping and killing the young and the elderly,"" said Commission member Andrew Clapham at a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday.
The Commission says it is continuing to collect evidence of human rights abuses and other crimes with an eye toward their being applied toward justice mechanisms. It says it has three case studies documenting war crimes , which it will pass along for potential prosecution.
""We think that through accountability and reconciliation there's the possibility for the South Sudanese to deal with the past and secure their future stability and prosperity,"" Clapham said. Nothing Is Going Right In The World's Newest Nation
Central to the conflict, the report finds, is South Sudan's near total economic reliance on oil. The ""increased militarization and securitization of the oil industry by Government forces,"" who are working to protect their own economic interests in the oil sector, risk ""turning South Sudan into a police state built on fear, rent-seeking and corruption,"" the report says. Further, oil revenues are being used to fund the fighting.
And while the report focuses on last year, Clapham notes that intense fighting goes on in the state of Central Equatoria between government forces and a militant group. ""A scorched earth policy"" has led to torched homes, civilians being killed and women and girls raped. Thousands of civilians have been displaced in the latest burst of fighting."

NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson gives us analysis of the news around the resignation of Kirstjen Nielsen from the Department of Homeland Security.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to continue the conversation with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, Thanks so much for joining us.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Happy to be here.
MARTIN: What does this mean?
LIASSON: I think it means that the president, who had been frustrated with Secretary Nielsen and is frustrated with the surge of asylum-seekers at the border, just decided to make a change. And he did this the other day, where he took down his nominee for ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said we're going in a tougher direction. And he had, we know, complained in the past that Nielsen hadn't been tough enough. And maybe he has something in mind where he will have a, quote, ""tougher""-looking policy towards the border with tougher-looking people.
MARTIN: As - sort of following this story in real time, and you can see the anonymous sources offering different messages to different networks, as they are want to do, some suggesting that she resigned because she was frustrated, others suggesting that she was fired because the president was frustrated. Do you have any insight about which of those versions is true?
LIASSON: I think she was frustrated, and I think she was asked to resign. I think that she was widely kind of on thin ice for so long. I think that the story really is that how long she lasted, not so much that he decided to fire her. Many people expected her to be removed from the Cabinet right after the midterm elections. That didn't happen. It seemed that she was on firmer ground with the president. She made many trips to the border. She certainly delivered his message about the border. But he's unhappy.
He's unhappy not just with the fact that there's been a surge of migrant families at the border, but also all of the things that he's tried to do haven't worked out. Remember, just this week, he said he was going to close the border. Then he backed down from that. He's talked about putting tariffs on Mexico if they don't stop immigration and drugs, but he can't do that because of the new USMCA, the new renegotiated NAFTA agreement that he signed. So the president's frustrated about the border, and he wants new people.
MARTIN: So the president said on Twitter that the new person will be the current - at least the acting person will be the current Customs and Border Protection commissioner, Kevin McAleenan. What do we know about him? And do we expect that he might have a better relationship with President Trump than Kirstjen Nielsen seemed to have, since, as you pointed out, she seemed to struggle mightily and certainly in her utterances absolutely reaffirmed his policy and projected his point of view on these issues.
LIASSON: Well, my - I don't think that Kevin McAleenan is going to be the permanent Homeland Security secretary. There are other names that we've heard, including Rick Perry, who's currently the energy secretary. But the president has a very large number of acting secretaries right now. He's actually said he likes having people who are acting. It gives him more flexibility. And especially on the border, where he feels so strongly.
This is such a top issue for him - immigration, stopping immigration, the kind of fear of immigrants coming over the border to do harm to Americans, which is a constant theme of his, is something that will be a centerpiece of his re-election campaign. And I think that, more than anything else, you'll see him driving policy on the border, not necessarily whoever takes over from Kirstjen Nielsen.
MARTIN: Mara, we only have a couple of seconds left, but you've also pointed out that many of the - the president has been frustrated, in part, by the law. Is there any strategy that he's employing to try to address the fact that legal issues have kept him from implementing the policies that he prefers?
LIASSON: Well, he's tried several things, and they haven't worked out. He talked about closing the border. He's talked about, you know, superseding the USMCA with tariffs - a punishment, in other words, on Mexico. But the one thing that he has succeeded in doing is making the border, and what he calls the crisis at the border, front and center in the media narrative. And that is the way that he succeeded. He thinks this is a very important issue for him and his base in the next election.
MARTIN: That is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you so much.

Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images Up to 1 billion birds die from building collisions each year in the United States, and according to a new study, bright lights in big cities are making the problem worse.
The study, published this month in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment , examined two-decades of satellite data and weather radar technology to determine which cities are the most dangerous for birds. The study focused on light pollution levels, because wherever birds can become attracted to and disoriented by lights, the more likely they are to crash into buildings.
The study found that the most fatal bird strikes are happening in Chicago. Houston and Dallas are the next cities to top the list as the most lethal. One of the study's authors, Kyle Horton, a postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University, called the cities a ""hotspot of migratory action,"" adding, ""they are sitting in this primary central corridor that most birds are moving through spring and fall.""
New York City, Los Angeles, St. Louis and Minneapolis are also dangerous cities for birds, all in the top 10 of the list for both migration periods.
Collisions are the most prevalent during the two migration periods , one in the spring and one in the fall. More than 4 billion birds migrate across the United States per migration period, according to Horton.
For Chicago, more than 250 different bird species migrate through the city, adding up to 5 million overall for each migration period.
""Many of these birds are already in serious decline for other reasons,"" said Annette Prince, director of the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, a local conservation group. ""So when they're hitting buildings, this is adding to the loss of the healthy members of their species by needless collision.""
Prince's organization finds 5,000 to 6,000 birds per year in the 1-square-mile they search in downtown Chicago. Sixty percent of the birds they find are dead upon impact.

Texas Congressman Will Hurd Reacts To Resignation,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710885597/texas-congressman-will-hurd-reacts-to-nielsen-resignation,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Congressman Will Hurd who represents the 23rd district of Texas.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We are continuing to follow a developing story out of Washington, D.C. That is the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. To talk more about this, we've called on Representative Will Hurd. He is a Republican. He represents the 23rd District from Texas, and his district includes hundreds of miles of the border with Mexico. In fact, he's the only remaining Republican who represents a borderline district. He's with us now. Congressman Hurd, welcome back to the program. Thanks for joining us.
WILL HURD: It's always a pleasure to be on.
MARTIN: What's your reaction to this news that Secretary Nielsen is leaving? Are you surprised?
HURD: My reaction is going - is that it's going to make a difficult situation even more difficult. You - having new leadership in your senior position because it's not only going to be a new DHS secretary with the current Border Patrol director moving into the acting position. They're going to need a new Border Patrol director. And then you are also looking for a new ICE director. So this is going to make a challenging situation even more challenging. There is indeed a crisis going on at our border. In March, we had 100,000 people come into our country illegally. To get some context for that number, last year, 400,000 people in the entire year came in illegally. And so April's going to be even worse than March.
And my advice to the new head of DHS is, No. 1, we've got to start making some tough decisions on addressing long-term problems and the root causes, which is violence and lack of economic opportunities in the Northern Triangle, which is El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. We also need to make sure we're addressing some of these short-term issues like, why were 78,000 hours - man hours - by Border Patrol spent at hospitals escorting immigrants? Why do we not subcontract that out? Why do we - why does ICE, why does Border Patrol, why does CBP have three separate contracts to move people from point A to point B?
This is something that those officers shouldn't be doing. We should be subcontracting that type of work out. So the new - the acting director has his hands full. And a new head of DHS is going to have a difficult - come into a very difficult situation.
MARTIN: You alluded to the fact that there's been quite a lot of change in that department in recent days. The president, for example, withdrew his own nominee to be the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He said that he wants to go in, quote, unquote, a ""tougher"" direction. How do you understand that? What do you think he means by that?
HURD: Well, I don't know what he means by that. You'll have to ask him. But here's what I do now. I do know that people are taking advantage of our asylum laws. Applying for asylum is not a violation of the law. But when people are taking advantage of it, the people that really need that system are being impacted. When you have a lack of unity of effort in some places, you have a senior Border Patrol, you have a senior ICE, in some places you have a senior Coast Guard, but there's not one person in charge to make sure all the resources are being used in the right direction.
You're also going to have, you know, along the border, it's going to start getting hot in April. And that's going to have an impact on, you know, these masses of people that we have. And it's going to cause tempers to flare. So April's going to be incredibly tough. And we've got to start making some tough decisions in the short term. But again, the root causes of this problem is lack of economic opportunity and violence in the Northern Triangle. And the acting secretary should be working with the secretary of state to identify a special representative for that region.
MARTIN: All right. So much more to talk about than that. We thank you for talking with us. We hope we'll talk again in coming days. That's Representative - Congressman - that's Congressman Will Hurd from Texas. Congressman, thanks so much for talking to us.
HURD: Always a pleasure.

You - having new leadership in your senior position because it's not only going to be a new DHS secretary with the current Border Patrol director moving into the acting position. They're going to need a new Border Patrol director. And then you are also looking for a new ICE director. So this is going to make a challenging situation even more challenging. There is indeed a crisis going on at our border. In March, we had 100,000 people come into our country illegally. To get some context for that number, last year, 400,000 people in the entire year came in illegally. And so April's going to be even worse than March.
And my advice to the new head of DHS is, No. 1, we've got to start making some tough decisions on addressing long-term problems and the root causes, which is violence and lack of economic opportunities in the Northern Triangle, which is El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. We also need to make sure we're addressing some of these short-term issues like, why were 78,000 hours - man hours - by Border Patrol spent at hospitals escorting immigrants? Why do we not subcontract that out? Why do we - why does ICE, why does Border Patrol, why does CBP have three separate contracts to move people from point A to point B?
This is something that those officers shouldn't be doing. We should be subcontracting that type of work out. So the new - the acting director has his hands full. And a new head of DHS is going to have a difficult - come into a very difficult situation.
MARTIN: You alluded to the fact that there's been quite a lot of change in that department in recent days. The president, for example, withdrew his own nominee to be the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He said that he wants to go in, quote, unquote, a ""tougher"" direction. How do you understand that? What do you think he means by that?
HURD: Well, I don't know what he means by that. You'll have to ask him. But here's what I do now. I do know that people are taking advantage of our asylum laws. Applying for asylum is not a violation of the law. But when people are taking advantage of it, the people that really need that system are being impacted. When you have a lack of unity of effort in some places, you have a senior Border Patrol, you have a senior ICE, in some places you have a senior Coast Guard, but there's not one person in charge to make sure all the resources are being used in the right direction.
You're also going to have, you know, along the border, it's going to start getting hot in April. And that's going to have an impact on, you know, these masses of people that we have. And it's going to cause tempers to flare. So April's going to be incredibly tough. And we've got to start making some tough decisions in the short term. But again, the root causes of this problem is lack of economic opportunity and violence in the Northern Triangle. And the acting secretary should be working with the secretary of state to identify a special representative for that region.
MARTIN: All right. So much more to talk about than that. We thank you for talking with us. We hope we'll talk again in coming days. That's Representative - Congressman - that's Congressman Will Hurd from Texas. Congressman, thanks so much for talking to us.
HURD: Always a pleasure.

Behind The Departure Of Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710882966/behind-the-departure-of-homeland-security-secretary-nielsen?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson gives us analysis of the news around the resignation of Kirstjen Nielsen from the Department of Homeland Security.
We're going to continue the conversation with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, Thanks so much for joining us.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Happy to be here.
MARTIN: What does this mean?
LIASSON: I think it means that the president, who had been frustrated with Secretary Nielsen and is frustrated with the surge of asylum-seekers at the border, just decided to make a change. And he did this the other day, where he took down his nominee for ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said we're going in a tougher direction. And he had, we know, complained in the past that Nielsen hadn't been tough enough. And maybe he has something in mind where he will have a, quote, ""tougher""-looking policy towards the border with tougher-looking people.
MARTIN: As - sort of following this story in real time, and you can see the anonymous sources offering different messages to different networks, as they are want to do, some suggesting that she resigned because she was frustrated, others suggesting that she was fired because the president was frustrated. Do you have any insight about which of those versions is true?
LIASSON: I think she was frustrated, and I think she was asked to resign. I think that she was widely kind of on thin ice for so long. I think that the story really is that how long she lasted, not so much that he decided to fire her. Many people expected her to be removed from the Cabinet right after the midterm elections. That didn't happen. It seemed that she was on firmer ground with the president. She made many trips to the border. She certainly delivered his message about the border. But he's unhappy.
He's unhappy not just with the fact that there's been a surge of migrant families at the border, but also all of the things that he's tried to do haven't worked out. Remember, just this week, he said he was going to close the border. Then he backed down from that. He's talked about putting tariffs on Mexico if they don't stop immigration and drugs, but he can't do that because of the new USMCA, the new renegotiated NAFTA agreement that he signed. So the president's frustrated about the border, and he wants new people.
MARTIN: So the president said on Twitter that the new person will be the current - at least the acting person will be the current Customs and Border Protection commissioner, Kevin McAleenan. What do we know about him? And do we expect that he might have a better relationship with President Trump than Kirstjen Nielsen seemed to have, since, as you pointed out, she seemed to struggle mightily and certainly in her utterances absolutely reaffirmed his policy and projected his point of view on these issues.
LIASSON: Well, my - I don't think that Kevin McAleenan is going to be the permanent Homeland Security secretary. There are other names that we've heard, including Rick Perry, who's currently the energy secretary. But the president has a very large number of acting secretaries right now. He's actually said he likes having people who are acting. It gives him more flexibility. And especially on the border, where he feels so strongly.
This is such a top issue for him - immigration, stopping immigration, the kind of fear of immigrants coming over the border to do harm to Americans, which is a constant theme of his, is something that will be a centerpiece of his re-election campaign. And I think that, more than anything else, you'll see him driving policy on the border, not necessarily whoever takes over from Kirstjen Nielsen.
MARTIN: Mara, we only have a couple of seconds left, but you've also pointed out that many of the - the president has been frustrated, in part, by the law. Is there any strategy that he's employing to try to address the fact that legal issues have kept him from implementing the policies that he prefers?
LIASSON: Well, he's tried several things, and they haven't worked out. He talked about closing the border. He's talked about, you know, superseding the USMCA with tariffs - a punishment, in other words, on Mexico. But the one thing that he has succeeded in doing is making the border, and what he calls the crisis at the border, front and center in the media narrative. And that is the way that he succeeded. He thinks this is a very important issue for him and his base in the next election.
MARTIN: That is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you so much.
LIASSON: Thank you.

Texas Congressman Reacts To Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen's Resignation,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710877917/texas-congressman-reacts-to-homeland-security-secretary-nielsens-resignation?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Congressman Joaquin Castro about the resignation of Kirstjen Nielsen, the director of the Department of Homeland Security.
Now we're going to address the breaking news out of Washington. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position. President Trump tweeted this information a short time ago. To talk more about this, we've called Representative Joaquin Castro. He's a Democratic congressman from Texas. He represents much of San Antonio, not far from the U.S.-Mexico border. And he's with us now. Congressman Castro, thank you so much for joining us once again.
JOAQUIN CASTRO: Yeah. Thanks for having me.
MARTIN: What's your reaction to this news that Secretary Nielsen is leaving?
CASTRO: Well, you know, I thought that she should have resigned before when she was not honest with Congress about the plan to separate families some time ago. She also was not honest when she came in front of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which I chair. And I asked her the question very directly whether she had any knowledge of children who had died or been seriously injured in the government's custody, and she said no. And it turned out that wasn't true. So she leaves behind a very tortured legacy of separating families, the remain in Mexico policy, just last week where the - Commissioner McAleenan, who's now apparently going to be the acting secretary, they literally staged a press conference where they had women and children behind fences with razor wire.
And so it's a very troubled legacy. And now, I got to say about her, I really think that anybody that comes within President Trump's realm that's doing immigration is going to get sucked into doing it the way that he does it. So I'm not saying that the things I described were all her ideas, but she certainly stepped up to take the job. And I think history will show that she was part of these very ugly policies.
MARTIN: President Trump has been signaling some kind of change over the last week - and the last couple of days, certainly - where he pulled his nominee for Customs and Border Protection for the head of that agency, saying he wants to go in a, quote, unquote, ""tougher"" direction. How do you interpret that? What do you think he means by that?
CASTRO: Well, I mean, you see what they're doing. You know, as I mentioned, that press conference where they staged those folks behind chain link fences and razor wire, having them sleep on the ground for three or four nights or whatever it was. And the thing about that policy is that he has tried to convince us that if, as a nation, we just get crueler in terms of how we treat migrants, that less people will try to come here. But the exact opposite has happened. There are more people trying to come here. So his policy is a total failure. And I don't see how getting meaner or crueler is going to help.
MARTIN: Do you have any concerns at all about making this change in the middle of this surge at the border? I understand, I mean, of course you've made it very clear that you disagree with his policies. You've also made it clear that you think some of his policies are in part responsible for what we're seeing at the border. But do you have any concerns about this what seems to be a complete shakeup at the top of this agency in the middle of this situation?
CASTRO: Yeah. I mean, you ask a good question. And honestly, I hadn't thought about that. We just got the news. But, I mean, look. I think Donald Trump, of all of the different policy areas that we deal with in the federal government - education, health care, immigration, so forth - I think this is the one that he probably pays attention to the most. And this is the area where he's most in control or the people close to him are most in control. So I think anybody that comes in and takes that job is essentially going to be absolutely marching to Donald Trump's drumbeat.
MARTIN: I understand that this is very new news. We're just learning of this ourselves as well. I just wonder if you have any sense of whether Secretary Nielsen was pushed or did she jump herself and does that matter? Does it matter whether she resigned or whether she was fired?
CASTRO: You know, to be honest, probably not. You know, I had conversations with Republican colleagues in Congress over the last several months who say that they've known her personally and that she's not the person that is described in the media, that she's not this cold-hearted person who's, you know, trying to inflict pain on migrants. But look, at the end of the day, if you take a job that calls for you to do that and enact these policies, then you're on the hook for what this administration does.
And so, you know, and I have to agree with them to some point that, before all of this before, she was part of the Trump administration, there wasn't necessarily an indication that she was malicious towards people. But like I said, she's been part of what is going to go down in history as a very, very disturbing period in our nation's history in terms of how we treat people.
MARTIN: Well, to your point that the policies are what are relevant now, do you have any plans to call Secretary Nielsen before you again for any reason? Do you have any questions for her that she can now answer because she's no longer a part of the administration?
CASTRO: Oh, sure. I mean, we would - she had agreed to go and come in front of the Hispanic Caucus again. And of course now she's resigning or leaving her job. So I don't - we don't have subpoena power, so I don't know that she'll end up doing that. But I absolutely think that the Homeland Security Committee and the Judiciary Committee - they absolutely should try to bring her back and ask her questions that, you know, that we all still have about the situation.
MARTIN: But like what? Give me just - we have 30 seconds left. What is one question that you have for her that you'd like to hear her answer?
CASTRO: Well, we still don't know why these families were separated without a system to track them. There still is no answer to that, and the government is saying it's going to take two years to finally reunite the families that were separated.
MARTIN: That is Congressman Joaquin Castro. He's a Democrat from Texas. Congressman, thank you so much for talking to us.
CASTRO: Thank you.

A Language Of Listening
Also in step with our annual tradition, we checked in with U.S. Poet Laureate Tracy K. Smith to help us take the temperature on poetry's place in our national culture.
Smith thinks poetry offers an escape, as so many of us are consumed by politically divided discourse.
""Unlike politics, poems don't get you fired up in a position of authority and judgment over others. You're not arguing something down when you're talking about a poem,"" she said. ""You're saying, let me listen to this. Let me think about how I feel different as a result of what you've just said. And I think that's a really healthy way of approaching other people.""
'An Act Of Imagination'
And yet, these uber-politicized times are nonetheless bleeding into poetry, as Smith argued last year in an essay for The New York Times.
Richard Blanco can attest to this genre shift. At President Obama's second inauguration in 2013, Blanco delivered One Today , a poem illustrating a united America. In that moment, standing in front of a crowd of 1 million people, he told NPR, ""I stepped into my role as a civic poet.""
In the wake of major cultural tragedies like the Boston Marathon bombings and the Pulse shooting, he said his writing has become ""more socially engaged.""
""A different time has demanded a different kind of poem from me."" You'll find his truths to be self-evident in ""Declaration of Inter-Dependence,"" the opening work in his recently published collection of poems, titled How To Love A Country , where he slides from the themes of dependence to independence to interdependence in just one stanza.
We had Blanco pick his favorite #NPRPoetry tweet from this month's submissions so far. He chose a poem by Anthony Tao , titled ""Career Path.""
They said art was misery
so I sought it —
but it's not like you think, not rejection
of comfort, self- mutilation;
it was accepting who I am
is the person I will live with for the rest of this path,
which I'd prefer end some place I imagine.
The poem, Blanco said, cuts through the stereotype that poetry is an act of the self-absorbed.
""What people don't often understand about poetry, I think, is that it's also a way of objectifying your life and realizing that the poem is an act of imagination,"" he said. ""And the idea that you develop an artistic persona that becomes some other version of yourself in the poem.""
Throughout April, we'll be updating this page with your tweets we choose to read on air. So keep them coming.
As a reminder, here's how it works: Tweet your original poems to @npratc with the hashtag #NPRPoetry. Each week in April, a professional poet will share on All Things Considered some of the submissions that caught their eye.

SpaceX's new crew capsule arrived at the station on Sunday in a remarkable moment for commercial space exploration. NASA via AP
Humans have entered SpaceX's Crew Dragon while in orbit for the first time, just hours after the commercial spacecraft docked at the International Space Station on Sunday morning.
The new space vehicle, carrying only cargo and a human dummy, launched Saturday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. On Sunday, the ISS crew watched as Crew Dragon became the first American commercial space vehicle designed to carry humans to dock at the station , according to NASA.
Astronaut David Saint-Jacques and cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko swung open the hatch and entered the capsule at 7:07 a.m. Houston time, where NASA employees watched. The successful maneuver was also greeted with cheers from the Hawthorne, Calif., headquarters of Elon Musk's ambitious space company.
""Congratulations to all nations, private space firms and individuals who wake up every day driven by the magic of exploration,"" American astronaut Anne McClain , the third crew member on the station, said at a welcoming ceremony broadcast over NASA TV. ""This day belongs to all of us."" SpaceX Readies For Key Test Of Capsule Built To Carry Astronauts Into Space
The entire procedure was light on showmanship compared to SpaceX's last major flight test , when the company launched a red Tesla into space on its Falcon Heavy rocket. But Sunday's event was a major step forward for the company, which has so far only ferried cargo into and out of orbit.

""This is a good day,"" said Saint-Jacques, an astronaut with the Canadian Space Agency. ""The first day of a new era for the next generation of space explorers.""
During Sunday's mission, the ISS crew methodically checked off tasks, starting with atmospheric tests. After allowing the air in the craft to mix with the air in the station, the astronauts returned without oxygen masks to properly welcome Crew Dragon — by installing window covers and checking valves.
The crew also took selfies and videos, including a few shots with Crew Dragon's second passenger, a small, stuffed Earth with limbs and a perplexed facial expression that bounced about the capsule in microgravity. McClaine: “On behalf of Ripley, little Earth and myself, welcome to the Crew Dragon.” pic.twitter.com/Kq2Y4ijrOB — Antonia Jaramillo (@AntoniaJ_11) March 3, 2019
The successful demonstration brings the U.S. one step closer to once again sending people into orbit without relying on Russian space vehicles, which have ferried American astronauts to the International Space Station since NASA retired its shuttles in 2011.
Now, sensors on the dummy passenger will be able to offer a more complete picture of how a real human body will fare the trip in the new vehicle. That'll become crucial when NASA eventually sends astronauts up in Crew Dragon, which could happen as early as this summer , if all tests go as planned. 'Hard Capture Is Complete': SpaceX Capsule Docks With International Space Station
Those handpicked space travelers, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley , watched the Crew Dragon launch from Florida, then traveled to Hawthorne to see operations unfold along with the SpaceX team, according to NASA. The celebration was a milestone for Musk, who launched the company in 2002 with the goal of taking humans into space and one day colonizing Mars.
NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine marked Saturday's launch with a tweet , writing that the moment marked ""a new chapter in American excellence.""

More than 200 miles above the Earth, McClain and her crew mates offered a slightly different message. McClain called back to the early milestones in space exploration, including the first human to reach outer space – Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin – and the 1969 moon landing by American spaceflight Apollo 11.
""These events remind us ... that we can be united by a cause that is not based on fear, threat or common enemy, but rather on a bold endeavor,"" she said. ""An insatiable curiosity to go beyond what is known and to do what has never been done.""

""This first launch of a space system designed for humans built and operated by a commercial company through a public-private partnership is a revolutionary step on our path to get humans to the Moon, Mars and beyond.""
The Falcon 9 rocket booster landed on a droneship in the Atlantic at about 3 a.m. Saturday, SpaceX said, making it the 35th successful landing of one of the company's rocket boosters.
The Crew Dragon is carrying about 400 pounds of supplies and equipment for the three astronauts aboard the International Space Station.
Also aboard is Ripley, named after a certain fighter of an Alien. Ripley is no mere dummy, but ""an anthropomorphic test device outfitted with sensors to gather important data about what an astronaut flying aboard the spacecraft would experience throughout the mission,"" NASA says.
Anne McClain, the American aboard the space station, says she's looking forward to saying hello. Looking forward to meeting her in person in a couple days — Anne McClain (@AstroAnnimal) March 1, 2019
If the rest of the SpaceX mission goes as planned, two astronauts, Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, could be flying aboard the Crew Dragon as early as July, NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reported. 'Every Day Is A Good Day When You're Floating': Anne McClain Talks Life In Space
SpaceX founder Elon Musk noted the accomplishment in a post-launch news conference with NASA officials Saturday morning.
""I really believe in the future of space and I think it's important that we be ... out there among the stars. And I think that's one of the things that makes people excited about the future. That we want the things that are in science fiction novels and movies not to be science fiction forever, we want them to be real one day.""
NASA is also working with Boeing on a test flight of its Starliner capsule, also without a crew, scheduled for this year.

In the 1960s, Alice Waters studied abroad in France – and discovered a culinary world far from the processed food popular in America.
When she returned to California, she tried to find restaurants to recreate her experiences abroad, but she couldn't.
In 1971, she opened a small restaurant in Berkeley called Chez Panisse, where she focused on serving fresh, local ingredients. Just a few years later, Chez Panisse was named one of the best restaurants in America, and became one of the hottest locations for fine dining in the Bay Area.
Despite her success, Alice chose not to turn Chez Panisse into a restaurant empire. Instead, she continued to insist on cooking with food raised locally, sustainably, and ethically.
Today, most chefs agree Alice Waters and Chez Panisse sparked the farm-to-table movement in the restaurant industry.

Ben Solomon/NCAA Photos via Getty Images Baylor gave up a double-digit lead but hung on in the final minutes to win the NCAA women's title game against defending champs Notre Dame by a single point Sunday night in Tampa, Fla.
With the 82-81 victory, the Lady Bears clinched their third NCAA women's basketball championship — joining UConn and Tennessee as the only Division I programs with three or more titles. The last time Baylor clinched the title was in 2012 against the Fighting Irish.
Baylor kept a comfortable lead for the first half, before Notre Dame closed the gap to tie the game in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter.
With 3.9 seconds left, point guard Chloe Jackson drove past Notre Dame's defense to put Baylor ahead at 82-80. Then Notre Dame called a timeout and inbounded to tournament standout Arike Ogunbowale. The Irish had a chance to turn the game around when Ogunbowale was fouled going for a layup. But, lucky for the Lady Bears, Ogunbowale missed her first free throw in the remaining 1.9 seconds, leaving Baylor to hold on to the 1-point lead.
Baylor managed the final stretch without star forward Lauren Cox, who injured her knee in the third quarter. Cox, who hobbled to the sidelines on crutches to celebrate with her teammates after the final buzzer, told ESPN that she's unsure about the severity of her injury.
Cox, who contributed 8 points and 8 rebounds to Baylor's 62-50 lead before getting rolled off the court in a wheelchair, has remained a crucial player throughout Baylor's 37-1 season. Her early exit in the final raised the stakes for her teammates.

Thousands Of Israelis Now Call Germany's Capital Their Home,www.npr.org,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/03/07/700356426/thousands-of-israelis-now-call-berlin-home-and-make-their-cultural-mark,"People relax on a bridge in Berlin. An estimated 10,000 Israelis have moved to the German capital in the past decade or so, leaving an imprint on the city of more than 3.5 million.

For decades after the Holocaust, many Jews refused to visit Germany. Some still do.
But now it has become common to hear Hebrew spoken in the bakeries and bars of Berlin.
At least 10,000 Israelis are estimated to have moved to the German capital in the past decade, according to Tal Alon, the Berlin-based editor of the Hebrew-language magazine Spitz .(The Israeli Embassy in Germany said it had no official statistic.)
Though the community is much smaller than some of the other immigrant groups in the city of more than 3.5 million, Israelis punch above their weight culturally. They are helping drive Berlin's blossoming culinary scene, with several high-end Israeli restaurants in the city including Layla , opened last fall by Tel Aviv celebrity chef Meir Adoni. And the director of Berlin's Maxim Gorki Theater, Yael Ronen , is Israeli, as is Daniel Barenboim , the conductor of Berlin's state opera.

""If somebody would tell me 10 years ago that one day I will live in Germany, I will speak German, and I would think about applying for [a] German passport, I would say they are crazy,"" said Israeli food designer Itay Novik, sitting at a Berlin café with an Israeli friend.
Much of Novik's mother's family was killed in the Holocaust, and he never considered visiting Germany. But he has lived in Berlin for eight years, having fallen in love with the city — and with a German man.
Many Israelis who have moved to Berlin are like him: gay, or politically liberal, or freelancers in artistic and creative fields, who feel at home in the avant-garde, anything-goes city. In recent years, the Israeli ex-pat community has expanded to include a more diverse demographic including tech workers at startups.

""It's a city where people don't interfere in your life,"" said Novik, co-author of a new Berlin Jewish food guide and contributor to a German-language Jewish cookbook . He recently held an experimental Eastern European Jewish-style dinner event for a Berlin food festival that he called Strictly Non-Kosher, featuring unorthodox recipes such as traditional gefilte fish cakes made of non-kosher eel.
""Israelis are made to feel very welcome in Berlin,"" said his friend Nirit Bialer. She runs a Berlin-based initiative called Habait to acquaint Germans with Israeli culture.
Some young Israelis apply for German, Polish or other European passports, gaining the citizenship that was stripped from their grandparents during the Nazi era. Often, Germans express gratitude that so many Israelis have made Berlin their home, despite the history.
""It's great that they find it cool to live here,"" said Felix Klein, the German government's commissioner for Jewish life in Germany and the fight against anti-Semitism. ""They are contributing very much.""
""The Germans always talk about reviving Jewish life in Germany. Of course, there's no way to reconstruct what they killed,"" said Alon, editor of the magazine catering to Israelis in Germany. ""But with time, they start to understand they have to live with substitutes. Israelis in a way are a substitute for the big Jewish German ethos that was destroyed.""
Many Israelis choose Berlin for one practical draw: the cheaper cost of living stemming from years of underdevelopment after the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall. That has drawn controversy back home. Several years ago, an Israeli government minister accused Israeli emigres of ignoring the Holocaust to go live on the cheap.

It's hard for Israelis in Berlin to escape historical baggage, a theme explored in The Land of Milk(y) and Honey , a recent play put on in a Berlin theater. Israeli actors shared real-life anecdotes from Israelis in the city, like this one, which drew laughs from the audience:
""My partner and I go to sex clubs sometimes. I meet with German people a lot. When they find out I'm from Israel they always say, 'Ah, it was such a bad thing, with Hitler and the Holocaust. I don't feel anything bad toward the Jews.' And I just think to myself, 'OK, thank you for saying that right now.' ""
As Berlin continues to develop, Israelis have joined a real estate rush driving up rental prices in the city, with Israeli investor groups purchasing entire Berlin apartment buildings in recent years. To deflate the ballooning rents, some in Berlin are calling for restricting foreign investment or even expropriating foreign-owned apartments. But Israelis still find it worthwhile to invest in the city.
""The prices are going to double themselves within the next 10 years for sure,""said Nizana Brautmann, an Israeli real estate surveyor in Berlin and manager of B-Space Estate , an investment company.
The return on investment is not the only satisfaction, she said.
When Israeli clients close on a Berlin apartment, she takes them to a notary. Outside the window is a memorial marking a spot where Nazis shipped Jews off to concentration camps.
""From the notary's office, we are looking down to this small memorial, and often I think, 'You see? We're back,' "" Brautmann said. ""And this is a good feeling."""

toggle caption Scott Everett White /The CW Over the course of four seasons of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend , Rebecca Bunch (Rachel Bloom) has kick-ball-changed.
Scott Everett White /The CW It's over.
After four seasons and 157(!) original songs, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend came to an end Friday night, with a supremely satisfying finale that felt both surprising and inevitable, which is precisely the needle that finales need to thread. (And how about that concert special? With the surprise reveal of Michael Hyatt — the show's MVP recurring cast member — at the end? I may have whooped.)
We're devoting an episode of Pop Culture Happy Hour to a full appreciation of this remarkable series, but it bears repeating that simply as a feat of logistics, the show's ability to write, choreograph, record, perform and edit so many elaborate musical numbers on a television production schedule remains mind-boggling.
To business: I have, for the show's first three seasons, assiduously and scientifically ranked the show's songs. I was going to do so for season four, and then for the show's entire run, but when I went to print out my rankings of the first three seasons it came to 25 pages.
Which is just, you know, a lot . Too much, arguably!
Hence this concentrated list, distilling the show's all-time best 27 numbers. (Why 27? Because I was originally gonna do 25 but couldn't bring myself to leave two favorites off the list. Is why.)
There are other best-of lists out there, of course. But the ones I've seen suffer greatly from recency bias, as they were not prepared with the rigor, the cool objectivity, the razor-like dispassion of this list, which rests on the same two criteria it always has:
1. Reprises and medleys do not qualify — because they, as any decent musical theater epidemiologist will tell you, make the data noisy.
2. The songs that earn the highest berths in this ranking do so because they move . They establish an idea, and then go someplace surprising with it; that's always been the genius of the show's writers. Now, not every song can contain an epiphany, but the ones that legitimately transcend the genre they're spoofing in some way are the ones that end up here.
If I've written up a given song before, I'll include the blurb, then comment on how my thinking has changed. Because my thinking on many of these songs has changed, over time. Some that earned #1 rankings in past seasons have slid down a bit, others have hurled themselves higher up. A handful of songs have taken on added resonance, now that the show is over and can be regarded as a whole.
Pop Culture Happy Hour A Rigorously Objective Ranking Of The 28 Songs Of 'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend' Season Two Pop Culture Happy Hour The 25 Songs Of 'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend' Season 3, Rigorously And Definitively Ranked But before we get to the ranking, let's tick off the
Honorable Mentions: These are the numbers that have a special, enduring, and not easily classifiable appeal. Either I just plain old love them, or I understand intellectually why others do, but I couldn't find a way to fit them into the actual ranking, because science is cold and hard and uncompromising, and appeals to the heart leave it unmoved.
""Nothing Is Ever Anyone's Fault"" (Season 3)
What I Said Then:
This song wraps some very dark, and troubling, and just really no-good sentiments inside a lovely and (very deliberately) conventional Broadway melody — like a delicious but poisonous show-tune burrito! — then stands back and lets us bask in the discomfiting cognitive dissonance. In other words, it's the Platonic example of this show's mission statement. Also? Not for nothing? Listen to how perfectly, and smartly, it expresses Nathaniel's characteristic, rationalizing, blame-shifting narcissism. If you find yourself singing along to ""It wasn't technically Hitler's fault!/(It wasn't technically Hitler's fa lt!)/Hitler's brother died/And that made him super sad!"" in the car, try not to do it when stopped at a traffic light. Trust me.
What I Say Now:
Yeah, I just love it. Every narcissist sociopath should make it their audition song.
""I Go To The Zoo"" (Season 3)
What I Said Then:
Last season's ""Man Nap"" covered a lot of this same, toxic-masculinity-poorly-conceals-a-wounded-infantilism ground, but Nathaniel's would-be club banger is a funnier, more accomplished endeavor all around, because of the details: He loves bottle-feeding panda cubs and identifying with monkeys ( ""Their eyes look like MY eyes!"" )! Again, the explicit version is worth it. Those f-bombs really drive home his odd but fiercely held opinions on Kingdom Animalia ( ""I ain't f***ing with no ZEBRAS!"" )
What I Say Now:
No, yeah, you seriously have to get the explicit version. Really brings the glorious goofiness of this song home.
""Settle For Me"" (Season 1)
What I Said Then:
I know, I know . You l ve this song. It should be higher! Top five, easy! Look: it's great. The performance is wonderful. And Bloom's ""It's a practical proposal!"" comes in at JUST the right time, with JUST the right English on it. But once we get the setup, the execution is deft, but on rails.
What I Say Now:
Boy, this song has its hardcore fans. I've heard from most of 'em. But for me there's just no z-axis, you know? It's one of the rare instances of the show doing something we've seen done before, elsewhere, a lot.
""Gettin' Bi"" (Season 1)
What I Said Then:
Give it this much: it sounds like the Huey Lewis song that would be playing in the scene set in an 80s bar when the producers couldn't get the rights to ""Power of Love."" But that's just not enough to move it higher up this list.
What I Say Now:
Boy, that was pretty obtuse. I completely missed the song's sly importance, giving bisexuality the anthem it didn't know it needed. Guess I was just letting my personal distaste for the thing it's so precisely riffing on get in the way. I get it now - it's funny, it's smart, it matters a great deal to a great many people. Who have their own lists to make. This is mine.
""Anti-Depressants Are So Not A Big Deal"" (Season 4)
This terrific little number — which is such a, um, devout homage to La La Land 's ""Another Day of Sun"" you can almost hear the CW lawyers drafting defensive memos on what constitutes Fair Use — takes on added weight now that the show's over, as it represents a major step in Rebecca's arc. We've watched her getting healthier, and learning that it's a complicated process that requires support, both emotional and, sometimes, pharmaceutical. An important message, delivered through the magic of tap. Plus, Michael Hyatt as Dr. Akopian, come on. So why didn't it make the list? It very nearly did. I suspect that, with time, it'll come to be seen as one of the show's signature numbers. Not quite yet, though.
Ok. Here we go:
The top 27 songs of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend 27. ""Life Doesn't Make Narrative Sense (The End of the Movie)"" (Season 3)
What I Said Then:
No, look, a lot of the charge this song carries comes from the visual — the Josh Groban reveal, coming as it does so late. But the deliberate hackiness of repeating the last word in the previous line gets a lot of fun play here — I could listen to Groban sink his teeth into the very, very stupid line, "" Role-oh-ole-oh-OLE "" all damn day. But this song is legit smart about the distinction between lives tidily shaped by narrative conventions, and our actual, much messier, lived lives. That's not something you expect to get handed to you on The CW at 8:00 on a Friday night. No-oh-oh-oh-OH.
What I Say Now:
I still say this song is one of the show's wisest, lyrically.
26. ""Maybe This Dream"" (Season 2)
What I Said Then:
It's inevitable that this show would eventually return to a Disney-song parody, given the excellence of last season's ""The Villain in My Own Story."" After all, the whole musical genre, at least as it lives in the current public consciousness, wouldn't exist without animated Disney movies. So once we got a villain song, a princess song couldn't be far behind.
It's interesting to note that this particular princess song is defiantly old-school, back when Disney princesses came with a bit more operetta than they do today. And Champlin, of course, absolutely nails the requisite trills like the pro she is. And also the poop jokes.
A the poop jokes.
(Right? Bird poop and dump cramps and peeing just a little . What is going on over at Crazy Ex-Girlfriend HQ? Do they need to switch craft services providers?)
What I Say Now:
I've seen Champlin do this song live, and despite its wistful, lilting prettiness, she makes it a barn-burner.
25. ""Don't Be A Lawyer"" (Season 4)
Burl Moseley, everyone! Bringing New Jack Swing to West Covina! And the production, with those wah-wah keyboards! And the suits , my God, the suits! And the lyrics, with their deft deployment of the words ""Jeff Sessions""!
24. ""Friendtopia"" (Season 2)
What I Said Then:
Oi! Ladies and Gentlemen: the Spoice Guhls!
(Yes, the British accents are terrible. Awful. Execrable. But I think that's kind of the point? Or at least one of them?)
Look past the accents, if you can, and instead see the song for what it is: A gloriously infectious manifesto for a comically dystopic feminist future ruled with an iron, exquisitely manicured fist, zigazow.
The next time you watch Wheel of Fortune and there's that beginning bit where the audience shouts the show's name, see if you can stop yourself from screaming ""Czar! Of! Torture!"" at the TV.
If you can, you're stronger than I am.
What I Say Now:
Let's just go home and drink rose. Oh, and while I have you: zigazow.
23. ""I'm A Good Person"" (Season 1)
What I Said Then:
Well this song just makes your whole damn day better, is what. (Get the explicit version. Trust me. Thank me later.) It's so exuberant, it's infectious – the Zika of showtunes! Does it move from its starting position? No. Shut up. I'm gonna go listen to it again.
What I Say Now:
Yikes, Zika reference. This song holds up — I was delighted to see it included in the concert special. But man, it's been so long since I heard the broadcast version, I was taken aback by the clean lyrics. The filthy ones are light-years better.
22. ""Remember That We Suffered"" (Season 2)
What I Said Then:
If this song gave us only Tovah Feldshuh, it would be enough; dayenu !
If it gave us only Tovah Feldshush singing the lyric:
I know, I know/The Holocaust/But the Holocaust/Is a really big deal!
... it would be enough; dayenu !
And if this song gave us only Tova Feldshuh, and that lyric, and Patti Freaking LuPone
... it would be enough; dayenu !
And if this song gave us only Tova Feldshuh, and that lyric, and Patti Freaking LuPone singing Nights like these are filled with glee/Noshing, dancing, singing, whee!/But we sing in a minor key/To remember that we suffered
.... it would be enough; dayenu!
But it didn't.
It gave us all of that — Tovah! Patti! Lyrics!— plus the following exchange, for which I would gladly give over the Peabody this article will surely earn me:
When I say ""We,"" you say ""Suffer!""
We!
-Suffer!
We!
-Suffer!
There's nothing for it but to surrender before the klezmeriffic perfection that is this, indisputably the best number of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend , Season Two.
What I Say Now:
That's right, I ranked it the #1 song of Season 2, at the time. And yet, today, there are five other Season 2 songs higher up this list. How do I explain this? Time changes things. Some songs take on the patina of all-time classics, others start to seem more like novel one-offs. I mean, I still love this song, and firmly believe it belongs here, in the pantheon of the show's all-time greats. But is it possible I was besotted by the Feldshuh/LuPone combo platter this number served up? I'm a gay man; the possibility cannot be safely ruled out. Or maybe I'm just a sucker for klezmer. Who can say?
21. ""Tell Me I'm Okay, Patrick"" (Season 2)
What I Said Then:
Every so often this show reminds just you how deeply, how consummately, its creators know and love musicals. Plenty of shows do musical episodes that feel dutiful, practiced, but not the product of a deep, lifelong passion for the form.
This classic torch song is different. It doesn't simply check the boxes, though it does do that — it feels lovingly made. Its melody, and its every chord progression, feel not simply imitative but essential, archetypal. You've heard songs like this before, and you will again, but this represents a perfect distillation of all of them.
You know where this song is going — you can predict the next note — but you don't mind, because that means it's vibrating on precisely the frequency that classic Broadway does.
What I Say Now:
Like a lot of the songs on this list, this number could be taken as the show's mission statement.
20. ""The Math of Love Triangles"" (Season 2)""
What I Said Then:
This is just a whole lot of fun, is all. One of the longest numbers of the season, with the most moving parts. Bloom's note-perfect Marilyn breathiness, the increasingly exasperated chorus of nattily dressed gay mathematicians — I mean you gotta respect a classic comedy construction like:
Is this a triangle?
-No, that's a shoe.
Is this a triangle?
-No, that's you.
So I'm a triangle?
-WHAT? No!
1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 3, GO!
(Man, I really love that ""WHAT? No!"" )
This song builds off of Season One's ""Settle for Me,"" which featured a Rebecca distractedly enamored of the trappings of Old Hollywood ("" Soooo twirly! "") and also underscores the fact that she knows exactly what she's doing ("" Thanks for teaching me man-math! "")
What I Say Now:
I've heard this number countless times, and "" Thanks for teaching me man-math! "" still gets me, every time.
19. ""West Covina"" (Season 1)
What I Said Then:
A perfect encapsulation of the show, and its protagonist's willfully skewed sense of the world – or at least, of one particular exurb. Celebrates the place by making fun of it. Makes fun of the place by sincerely celebrating it. It's a tough tone to get right, but this very very does. (This song ranked higher earlier in the season, but we've got a hell of a lot more songs now, and the sheer novelty of this one has begun to wear.) (NOTE: I'm not ranking the show's Theme Song, but if I did, it'd probably share this slot.)
What I Say Now:
This song merits its slot here in the final ranking due to the fact that it represents the precise moment I, and many other people, first realized this show knew exactly what it was doing — that I, that we, were in good, knowing hands.
18. ""Dream Ghost"" (Season 1)
What I Said Then:
""You know the trope/In storytelling it's the norm...""
Ok, it's a very faithful (possibly legally actionable) Dreamgirls bit, and what have I said about pastiches?
But.
Well.
I mean, I'm me, so any song that busts out the word ""trope"" in its opening verse has got my damn number. The fact that it goes on to be very much about narrative cliches, and their structural function – sign me the hell up.
Always bugged me that Amber Riley and Ricki Lake got such hype about their appearance as background singers. I mean, sure, it's a cute stunt, but it's Michael Hyatt doing the heavy lifting here, and she's fantastic.
(Also? Not for nothing? ""We're other dream ghosts helping people on this plane"" .... OF EXISTENCE GET IT RIGHT I JUST BROKE YOUR BRAIN DIDN'T I)
What I Say Now:
This was our first glimpse of what Michelle Hyatt would bring to the show — the richness, the charisma, the timbre. Glad to see that four-years-ago-me was a Hyatt stan from the jump.
17. ""The Moment Is Me"" (Season 3)
What I Said Then:
Those of you surprised to see this cheese-tastic, psuedo-inspirational, goth-girl-goes-theater-kid anthem perched atop this chart just haven't been paying attention. It's not the idea of the thing that got it here — let's face it, as forms go, Skeptical Person Involuntarily Gives In To Big Musical Number enjoyed its cultural apotheosis with Buffy's Once More With Feeling .
But here, the execution is what sells it. Vella Lovell's Heather has been overdue for big moment like this one from her very first eye-roll back in season one. She's got to sell the transition between Heather's baseline bored reluctance and the demands of a splashy ""I Want"" song. That's the challenge, and she nails it.
Crucially, wonderfully, she doesn't sell out the character once that transition kicks in. She lets us hear Heather's deadpan disgust throughout, allowing the musical arrangement do all the jazz-handy work. I mean, listen to the beautiful, understated work going in the opening seconds, the seamless shift: ""Do I have to sing an inspirational musical-theater song right now 'cause I just can'tWHAT DOES THE FUUU-TURE HOLD""
Every pained grunt, every murmured aside (""Like, so on the nose"") is fresh and funny and manages to surprise, no matter how many times you hear it. And that, people, is why ""The Moment is Me"" has earned its spot here, as King of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Season Three Mountain.
What I Say Now:
Yep, this was my #1 song of Season 3. Yet there are four other Season 3 songs that rank higher in this final ranking. It's still wonderful, and Lovell's performance remains pitch-perfect, but those other songs inched higher because they speak more directly to the show's central thesis.
15. ""Sex With a Stranger"" (Season 1)
What I Said Then:
""Most people don't know about the window"" is when I laughed, aloud, alone in the apartment. Also, the ""balls"" rap break. (Specifically, the ""hou-AWHS/show-AH"" bit.) Also, ""Thank god, it's just your penis."" Also, ""Don't steal!"" Also, its a sharp and knowing and ruthlessly funny distillation of some dark, dark stuff.
What I Say Now:
This song came so early in the show's run that it set a ridiculously high bar for songwriting excellence.
14. ""The Sexy Gettin' Ready Song"" (Season 1)
What I Said Then:
Plants itself squarely inside the style its parodying and then – doesn't merely parody it. Goes somewhere. Says something. Expresses the show's specific point of view even as its crawling inside your ear to set up housekeeping.
What I Say Now:
We've lived with this song — and other Season 1 bangers like ""Sex With A Stranger"" — for so long now I fear we take their brilliance for granted. Familiarity breeds a lack of appreciation, if those other Crazy Ex-Girlfriend song rankings out there are any indication. But not here. This is a quintessential CxGF number.
13. ""Let's Have Intercourse"" (Season 2)
What I Said Then:
Like the Littlefeather chorus, I was dubious about the addition of Scott Michael Foster this season, but with this perfectly ridiculous but sharply observed Ed Sheeran number, he both defined his character and won me over.
Come on let's quickly have intercourse
So I can move on
With my life
(My busy life)
To be specific, the plaintive, self-important way he sings that "" Mah busy life "" bit, above, is what won me over.
Also: They're prob'ly straighforward nihhhh-ples.
That, too. Not made of stone, here, people.
What I Say Now:
""Mah busy life"" remains a solid piece of business.
12. ""Miracle of Birth"" (Season 3)
What I Said Then:
I'm always here for a Donna Lynne Champlin spotlight number, and this steers into her particular gifts with verve and aplomb. Who else could express all that anatomical detail, and despair, in such a sweet, pure voice, and not have it come off like a cheap gag? Nobody but DLC, is who. Whom.
What I Say Now:
You know, I only ranked this #10 of Season 3, at the time. But it's become one of the songs I return to most often, due in part to Champlin's pure tone, and in part — a large part — to her delivery of "" It's your BEEBEE ! ""
11. ""The First Penis I Saw"" (Season 3)
What I Said Then:
It may seem surprising to see this light n'frothy bit of business hold such a high perch on this ranking. Haven't I said below that it's the songs that engage with season three's darkness that earn high positions? Well, yeah, sure. Generally. But I mean ... have you listened to this charming thing? This stuff is golden. Abba golden, in point of fact. The brightness of the arrangement! The keyboard! Those strings! The supreme confidence of a line like ""It really made me drop my jaw""!
What I Say Now:
This number could have been little more than a cute throwaway, but it attains immortality on this list on the back of Champlin's performance.
10. ""It Was A S*** Show"" (Season 2)
YouTube What I Said Then:
A perfect, bittersweet number with which to send Santino Fontana's Greg, and his golden pipes, off into the sunset: starts off in crooner mode, but builds into an old-school Broadway farewell. Plus, lines like "" A play about pieces of feces/Is what we are together"" and intentionally forced rhyme ( I should split, though and ... well. You get it.).
What I Say Now:
Do not even consider listening to the broadcast version. Explicit only.
9. ""JAP Battle"" (Season 1)
YouTube What I Said Then:
A great idea, executed flawlessly. And WOW do you need to hear the explicit version immediately. (That was rhetorical. You do.)
What I Say Now:
I know I sound like a broken record, but the explicit lyrics land so much harder than the broadcast version. I mean, it doesn't get purer, cleaner than "" That tough act's a bluff /So sheket bevaka, shut the f*** up ""
8. ""We'll Never Have Problems Again"" (Season 2)
YouTube What I Said Then:
This. Is just. Perfect. Everything about it.
Even before the hand claps — and everyone knows any song with hand claps is a good song, that's just a medical fact — this number represents the show at its finest. Sadness so deeply embedded within its joyousness — and the joyousness here is potent — that you could almost miss it.
Hey look! Another sunset!
What I Say Now:
Do not let this song's considerable, arrant grooviness blind you to its wisdom, in re: the way love deludes us into thinking everything's jake when in fact there is a great dearth of jake.
7. ""You Stupid Bitch"" (Season 1)
YouTube What I Said Then:
Raw and real and funny and kind of terrifying all at once. Plus a key change. I'm not made of stone here, people.
What I Say Now:
Another distillation of the entire show, in song. Searing, funny, devastating, perfect.
6. ""Let's Generalize About Men"" (Season 3)
YouTube What I Said Then:
Admit it. You thought this would be number one. You did, I can tell. But that's the difference between you, cookie, and me, a professional big-time critic-type-person. Granted, this I-Love-the-80s /Pointer Sisters pastiche is the song I've gone back to the most this season, for several reasons. (Leave aside, if you can, the visuals, which are so chillingly spot-on. The hair! The earrings! The shoulderpads and skirts and hose and shoes! Also the neon! And that glitter spray thingy!)
No, this song is all about its combined lyrical effect. The spin Ruiz's Valencia puts on the last word in the line, ""All men only want to have say-ux !,"" for example. And the fact that the observations made about men are so hack, so basic, so An Evening at the Improv. That's exactly the point — these women aren't arriving at breathtaking new insights, they're getting drunk and voicing strongly held beliefs — ""a bunch of blanket statements""-- in an environment of mutual support.
What I Say Now:
Yep, originally this came in at #2 of Season 3, behind ""Remember That We Suffered,"" but over the course of the last year it's achieved an iconic status. Great to see performed live, too.
5. ""Where's The Bathroom?"" (Season 1)
YouTube What I Said Then:
The Earworm of Earworms. Bow down before it. There is no escape. Y'all about to get klezmerized. The performance just could not be more on point, and the way it builds to that mid-point turn, where the theme from Jaws kicks in so seamlessly: yowza. I love this song so much I'ma boycott cheddar cheese in solidarity.
What I Say Now:
For for years now, the word ""bathroom"" cannot be spoken in my apartment without someone launching into this number. Happens with ""where's"" sometimes, lately. If it ever happens with ""the"" it'll be time for professional help.
4. ""Feelin' Kinda Naughty"" (Season 1)
YouTube What I Said Then:
That baby-voice thing Bloom does at the beginning. The slow build to ""wear your skin like a dress"" and ""baby teeth"". This song should be taught in schools. You know, like that one from Fame .
What I Say Now:
On of our firsts indication that there was some real darkness — thick, tarry darkness — bubbling under the surface of this show.
3. ""No One Else Is Singing My Song"" (Season 4)
YouTube For my money, the best song of Season 4, and, clearly, one of the best of the series, period. Goes right to the heart of the show's exploration of mental illness, cheerfully and tunefully. You could just tell someone who seems to be struggling that while they may feel utterly alone, others are going through precisely the same thing — or you could just play this song for them.
2. ""Face Your Fears"" (Season 1)
YouTube What I Said Then:
Champlin: good lord. The melisma. The self-importance. You can hear the ""I am about to impart some Whitney-esque wisdom"" in the fullness of that voice. Plus, this song is just SUCH A GOOD IDEA. An advice song filled with specific, earnestly proffered but howlingly terrible advice.
What I Say Now:
I have nothing to add, except maybe: Champlin. Good LORD.
1. ""A Diagnosis"" (Season 3)
YouTube What I Said Then:
Everything works, here. The 80's power-ballad buildup. The desperation evident in the rhyme scheme ("" With a diagn sis/I'm ready to bl w this/Joint, and by joint I mean my innner sense/Of confusion ""). The desperation you can hear in Rebecca's voice. This song is emblematic of the needle this show's been threading all season long — respecting how fraught and complicated a prospect it is to turn the travails of mental illness into blistering one-liners and catchy ditties ... and then doing it anyway. This is another song about something real, and defiantly unpretty, and rarely discussed, much less sung about — our collective search for answers, our need to belong, our belief that a medical diagnosis represents the magical end of suffering, not the beginning of a long process of managing it.
What I Say Now:
This song only came in at #5 in the Season 3 ranking, but now that the series is over, it's clear that it deserves the top spot, overall. It arrived at crucial inflection point in Rebecca's story, as she begins to seek the help she needs. It's Crazy Ex-Girlfriend in microcosm, encapsulating everything the show was about — pain and desperation, yes, but expressed through joy, and wit, and nerve."
"Before The U.S.-Mexico Border, Migrants Must Cross The Guatemala-Mexico Border : NPR",www.npr.org,John Burnett,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/710348088/coyotes-boomtown-picking-up-the-migrant-trail-on-the-way-to-the-u-s-mexico-borde,"Some Central American migrants start their journey through Mexico at the Guatemalan border town of Gracias a Dios.

Mario Garcia sits in the doorway of his tire shop in Gracias a Dios, Guatemala, a short distance from the border with Mexico, watching the unfettered flow of migrants headed north. By his estimate, up to 1,000 migrants cross over into Carmen Xhan, Mexico, every day.
""This is an open border,"" Garcia says, with a knowing smile. ""There's no immigration control on this side or the other side. Anyone can go across freely.""
The migrant trail that begins in Central America and ends in the United States must cross the Guatemala-Mexico border — where immigration control is light to nonexistent. More and more migrants are choosing to start their journey up through Mexico in the remote, hilly village of Gracias a Dios — Spanish for ""Thanks to God.""
In recent months, Gracias a Dios has become a trafficker's boomtown, and what happens here helps explain the recent surge of migrants entering the United States.

A well-established network of coyotes, or human smugglers, is taking advantage of lax border controls and Mexico's fleet of commercial express buses, according to interviews with migrants, Guatemalan border residents and U.S. immigration authorities. That means the journeys have become quicker and safer, which spurs even more illegal immigration.
Smugglers are billing these routes as a less arduous alternative to the massive, highly publicized caravans of migrants plodding north on foot. Kirstjen Nielsen Leaves Homeland Security Post As Border Crossings Surge
""There's some opportunity to provide a smoother, faster, more well-planned movement than just starting out walking and taking a 30- to 45-day journey through all the different countries and across all the different borders,"" said Derek Benner, executive associate director of Homeland Security Investigations.
The mayor of Gracias a Dios, Marvin Hernandez, explains that the village came into being nearly a century ago when a family fleeing the Mexican Revolution settled just across the border in Guatemala. Enlarge this image

""They said, '¡Gracias a Dios!' and it stuck,"" Hernandez recounts. ""Now the migrants crossing in the other direction are saying it.""
Hernandez says he noticed about two years ago that more travelers were passing through the town, population 750.
""Since then, it's increased a lot,"" he says.
Roughly 150 adults and children are gathered at a stash house, waiting around for their trip northward. John Burnett/NPR hide caption toggle caption John Burnett/NPR Roughly 150 adults and children are gathered at a stash house, waiting around for their trip northward. John Burnett/NPR
Hernandez built a restaurant, Comedor Azteca, with money he earned when he worked as a cook in Virginia in the early 2000s. ""The migrants come in and eat a meal before they cross,"" he says. ""It's good for my business.""
Day and night, buses arrive here from the state capital of Huehuetenango and unload families from El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and the interior of Guatemala.
Some of them assemble at a run-down, aqua-colored stash house in the center of town, behind a soccer field and next to a Jehovah's Witness kingdom hall. On a recent afternoon, about 150 adults and kids were waiting around for their trip northward — spilling out the front door, sitting under trees and lounging on the grass.

They scattered when a reporter approached. Then a heavyset, scowling man bolted out of the stash house, waved his arms and yelled, ""This is private property! Get lost!""
Migrants who cross at Gracias a Dios typically pay coyotes to arrange transport all the way to the U.S.-Mexico border — 1,800 miles away. The going price is $5,000 to $7,000 for a package deal for an adult and a child.
Passenger vans and other vehicles pick them up in Gracias a Dios and carry them to the city of Comitán, an hour inside Mexico. Several local observers, including Gracias a Dios' mayor, say the migrants breeze through a Mexican federal checkpoint, just south of Comitán, because the coyote pays off immigration officials.

In Comitán, the migrants board tourist buses to Mexico City. There, they transfer to express buses that speed to places near the U.S.-Mexico border like Ciudad Juárez, where they wade across the shallow Rio Grande and surrender to the Border Patrol in El Paso, Texas.
If there are no delays, the trip can take as little as three days.

""Big caravan, big crime, big problems,"" he says, standing outside a boarding house across the soccer field from the stash house. ""I'll cross with two or three other people, and we'll get where we're going and try not to attract attention.""
Julio knows he needs to sneak into the U.S. undetected by the Border Patrol because adult migrants who are caught traveling alone are typically detained and put on a fast track to deportation.
Many migrants are also aware that if they bring a child with them, they won't be detained — the so-called ""catch and release"" policy that infuriates President Trump. If migrant families ask for asylum and pass a credible-fear interview, immigration agents usually release them into the U.S. with a notice to appear in immigration court, because detaining families is difficult under current U.S. policies.

That is Javier's plan. He's also from San Salvador and staying in the same rooming house as Julio. He declined to give his full name because he plans to cross into the U.S. with his wife and three kids.
Asked why his family was making the trip north, Javier says, ""President Trump has to defend his nation, but the United States for us is like a mother, a mother who looks out for these small countries that we come from.""
Trump is contending with an increase in unauthorized border crossings, which officials said were on pace to hit more than 100,000 last month, the highest level in more than a decade. On Sunday, Trump announced that Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, whom he reportedly clashed with over the surge, would leave her post .
In late March, Trump threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border if Mexico didn't act to stop the flow of migrants.
Within days, Trump backed off that threat and then made a new one. He gave Mexico a ""one-year warning"" to address the migrants and drugs crossing the border or he would slap tariffs on car imports from Mexico.

Trump also credited Mexico for doing more to address immigration. On Friday, he tweeted: ""Mexico, for the first time in decades, is meaningfully apprehending illegals at THEIR Southern Border, before the long march up to the U.S. This is great and the way it should be. The big flow will stop.""
But there is no evidence of that in places like Gracias a Dios, where the flow of immigrants continues to grow. The majority of them are families and unaccompanied children from Central America, which represents a historic shift in immigration. A Surge Of Migrants Strains Border Patrol As El Paso Becomes Latest Hot Spot
It used to be that the Border Patrol mostly apprehended Mexican men crossing into the U.S. to find work. On warm nights, in plazas across Mexico, mariachis still sing sad songs of the exodus of their countrymen who went to el Norteto pursue their dreams.
""I swam the Rio Grande, ignoring the dangers. La migra turned me away, and I found myself in Nogales. I went to another border crossing, and they pushed me to Juárez,"" say the lyrics to the famous migrant ballad Los Mandados .
But all that has changed. The Border Patrol now apprehends more Central American families.
But why now? Why the current surge of migrants?
""Social media has motivated lots of people, hasn't it? It's saying if you don't go to the U.S. now, you might not be able to go tomorrow,"" says Olinto Laparra, a prominent businessman in the region of Gracias a Dios. He says he knows lots of people who've left for the U.S. lately.
While he's talking, he steers his pickup to avoid giant potholes that pock the highway that hugs the rugged Guatemala-Mexico border.
""How do you like our roads?"" Laparra asks sarcastically. ""Look at our sad reality.""
He blames state and federal leaders in Guatemala for stealing money they're supposed to use to maintain highways and bring services to remote villages. He says it's all part of a corrupt system that perpetuates poverty and allows rampant gang violence, and that is what's driving Guatemalans out of their homeland.
""Mr. Trump can close the border whenever he wants to,"" Laparra concludes, ""but the people will keep crossing. They have a lot of desire to overcome and get ahead."" Facebook"
Trump's Plan To Zap Incoming Missiles With Lasers Is Back To The Future : NPR,www.npr.org,Geoff Brumfiel,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/707689746/trumps-plan-to-zap-incoming-missiles-with-lasers-is-back-to-the-future,"Enlarge this image President Trump vowed in January to ""detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States anywhere, anytime, anyplace.""

toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP President Trump vowed in January to ""detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States anywhere, anytime, anyplace."" Doing so would likely mean basing defenses in space.
Evan Vucci/AP Earlier this year, President Trump laid out an ambitious plan for U.S. missile defenses. ""Our goal is simple,"" Trump said during a speech in January. ""To ensure that we can detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States, anywhere, anytime, anyplace.""
To reach that goal, the administration's proposed new defense budget calls for hundreds of millions of dollars to study the use of lasers and particle beams in space. ""It's new technology,"" the president said.
Except it isn't.
The defenses outlined by Trump look almost exactly like a decade-old program known as the Strategic Defense Initiative . That plan was laid out by President Ronald Reagan in a 1983 speech. Reagan's program, dubbed ""Star Wars,"" imagined an impenetrable shield that would include orbiting lasers and particle beams to zap then-Soviet missiles before they could hit their targets.
National Security Trump Unveils Ambitious Missile Defense Plans ""It's remarkable how similar all this stuff is. I'm actually not sure it's surprising,"" says James Acton , co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Acton says missile shields are limited by the rules of physics. ""At the end of the day, missile defense is a very, very tough problem, and there are a very limited number of ways of solving that problem.""
It's virtually impossible to make a nationwide missile shield without building it in space — it's only by taking the ultimate high-ground that one can defend a target as big as the U.S.
Unfortunately, trying to operate in space introduces a lot of problems. Technology that's already tough to operate on the ground must endure blistering heat, freezing cold, and cosmic radiation. And if anything goes wrong, it can't be fixed.
Despite tens of billions, Reagan's Star Wars program never produced a shield. But some say it's worth reconsidering.
""It would be negligent on our part not to go back and look at these technologies,"" says Rebeccah Heinrichs , a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

toggle caption Bettmann Archive President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as ""Star Wars,"" was a cornerstone of his defense policy.
Bettmann Archive Things have changed since the 1980s: Lasers are much smaller and much more powerful; satellites that once had to be the size of a school bus can be shrunk to the size of a shoe box.
""And we can get launch costs down, which was one of the biggest cost-drivers,"" Heinrichs says.
Little satellites combined with new and cheap commercial rockets might make a space-based defense program more affordable, she notes.
The Trump administration appears intent on revisiting some of the Star-Wars-era technology. The president's 2020 budget plan calls for $116 million to develop directed energy weapons for missile defense and $34 million more for particle beams. It also calls for $132 million for advanced sensors, which are essential to any space-based defense. It remains to be seen whether Democrats in the House will go along with the funding proposal.
Critics say a new Star Wars program is unlikely to come to much. Laura Grego , a physicist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, concedes there's been progress but says there hasn't been enough of it. Take particle beams — focused streams of atoms designed to fry a target. Here on Earth, the equipment needed to generate a powerful beam can be miles long and use as much electricity as a small city. Nobody's found a way to shrink that technology to satellite-size. In 1989, a prototype was launched briefly into space on a suborbital flight. It weighed 2,500 pounds and produced a minuscule beam that lasted only a few minutes.
It's remarkable how similar all this stuff is. I'm actually not sure it's surprising.
James Acton
""I don't know why they think this is practical again,"" Grego says.
And there's another problem no amount of technology can solve: A space-based system is constantly spinning around the Earth in its orbit.

U.S. Air Force/Wikipedia ""A single weapon is never where it's supposed to be for it to work well, so you'd need a constellation of them,"" Grego says. ""It becomes really expensive really quickly.""
A 2012 study by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences said a space-based defense system would require many hundreds of satellites and might cost as much as $300 billion dollars.
That figure, too, is disputed by some who think space-based defenses deserve a second look. Thomas Karako , director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says it is based on the only technology that could be ready in the foreseeable future: space based interceptor missiles. Lasers would have longer ranges and require fewer satellites, he points out.
""If we can get this right from space, I think we should be thinking about it,"" Karako says.
But for Grego, the renewed focus on technology overlooks the actual way Reagan ended up reducing the nuclear danger — not through lasers and beams, but through a series of arms control treaties that limited the numbers and types of nuclear weapons the U.S. and the Soviet Union could possess.
""It wasn't because we got great at missile defense,"" she says. ""It was just the hard work of treaties and negotiations."""
Prenatal Expanded Carrier Screening Tests Can Be Difficult To Interpret : Shots - Health News : NPR,www.npr.org,Lesley Mcclurg,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/08/710204097/prenatal-testing-can-ease-minds-or-heighten-anxieties,"Enlarge this image Shara and Robert Watkins hold their 5-month-old daughter, Kaiya, in their home in San Mateo, Calif., just after she had woken up from an afternoon nap. Lindsey Moore/KQED Lindsey Moore/KQED Shara and Robert Watkins hold their 5-month-old daughter, Kaiya, in their home in San Mateo, Calif., just after she had woken up from an afternoon nap.
Lindsey Moore/KQED It wasn't hard for Shara Watkins to get pregnant. It was hard for her to stay pregnant.
In 2016, she was devastated by two miscarriages. With the help of several medications, she successfully carried a child last year.
Shara and her husband, Robert, were elated when she reached her second trimester, the phase when the highest risk of miscarriage subsides.
Unfortunately the San Mateo, Calif., couple's struggles continued.
Shara spent four months of her pregnancy on bedrest. When their doctor offered extensive genetic testing to check the health of their fetus, the couple leaped at the opportunity. Shara had a history of rare disease in her family.
""I had a high-risk pregnancy, and there had been a lot of complications prior to this,"" says Shara. ""And, so I just wanted to have all the information that I could.""
Glut of information available to expecting parents
In the past, doctors may have screened parents for a few suspect diseases common to their specific ethnicity or family history. But now a growing number of companies offer extensive panels testing for hundreds of rare diseases.
""Over the last 10 to 20 years the number of genetic disorders that we are able to test for has exploded,"" says Dr. Mary Norton , a prenatal geneticist at University of California, San Francisco.
Silicon Valley is a hotbed for companies vying for the business of concerned future parents. The prenatal genetic testing industry is projected to grow nearly 30 percent over the next five years.
A wide variety of tests are now available to screen both fetus and parents. One option that's rapidly growing in popularity is called an expanded carrier screening.
About a dozen lab companies, most based in the San Francisco Bay Area, can scan a patient's blood or saliva for hundreds of conditions that their child could inherit.
A perfectly healthy parent can pass along an autosomal recessive disease like cystic fibrosis or Tay-Sachs, if their partner is also a carrier for the disease. When both parents have a mutated version of the same gene, then their child is at an increased risk for developing a condition.
""In these types of diseases, 80 percent of the time there's no family history,"" says Jim Goldberg, chief medical officer of Myriad Women's Health. Norton agrees that family history is not a very sensitive screening tool.
The ideal time to take a carrier screening is prior to conception because in vitro fertilization is still a possibility.
If both parents are found to be carriers of the same disease, IVF allows doctors to ensure a healthy fertilized egg by genetically screening the embryos before conception.
The tests must be prescribed by a doctor and screening panels vary widely in price. For example, a call to the customer service line for Myriad Genetics' lab in South San Francisco led to a price Quote: of $1,599 for patients who don't have insurance.

Does knowing more help?
When Shara and Rob's doctor emailed their tests results, the couple was alarmed because their physician suggested they see a genetic counselor to help them interpret the report.
""This new landscape is complicated and it's beyond the ability for most OB-GYN's to really understand it themselves and explain it well,"" says UCSF's Norton.
It appeared the Watkin's baby could inherit spinal muscular atrophy , or SMA, a potentially fatal disease. The couple hadn't discussed what they would do if their child was unhealthy.
""I called Rob in pure hysterics on my way to work,"" says Shara.
""When I got the call in my office she was crying,"" recalls Rob. ""We were both in kind of a panic mode immediately.""
Shots - Health News Home Birth Can Be Appealing, But How Safe Is It? Rob and Shara spent the day poring over page after page of testing results, and then subsequent days searching the Internet for answers.
""The test results give you kind of these alerts on the first page like you're a carrier for this, your carrier for this,"" Shara says. ""It's definitely not clear. I mean, if it had been clear we wouldn't have ever gone into full panic mode.""
Find an expert
Although Shara and Rob could have sought free counseling from one of Natera's genetic counselors, they chose an unaffiliated expert. They booked the first available appointment at Stanford Children's Health. Stanford billed $642 to Shara's insurance for the consultation. Her plan paid $352.
""They came to us with this information not knowing what it meant, not knowing what the risks were and not understanding the implications,"" says Meg Homeyer, a genetic counselor at Stanford. ""Plus, the language is difficult to interpret and sometimes can sound alarmist.""
As it turns out, Shara, Rob and their doctor thought their baby's risk of SMA was a lot higher than it was. The report says they were at an increased carrier risk, but that isn't the same thing as being an actual carrier for the disease.
""It was much more lower, more like 3,500,"" says Homeyer as she thumbed through the test results. Yet, even though Rob and Shara's worst fears didn't play out, they still lost sleep at night wondering if their child could be the 1 in 3,500.
Making sense of risks
Homeyer says she frequently sees parents agonize over how to feel, or whether to act on abstract numbers.
""They will not know whether a baby is 100 percent healthy until birth,"" says Homeyer. ""In the meantime they're trying not to worry about the risks but they can't help it.""
Homeyer says the value of a test is dependent on the values of an individual couple.
""There's the family that will want every possible test available,"" says Homeyer. ""They'll want no stone unturned because their tolerance for risk is low. There are other families where this information in pregnancy isn't useful for them.""
Like families who would not seek further diagnostic testing, or potentially terminate a pregnancy regardless of testing results.
""We often have people who say, 'I wish I had never started down this path,' "" says Norton. ""Although I don't think people can really anticipate how they'll feel until they get there.""
One test leads to the next
For those who choose to do a carrier screening, the worst-case scenario is their child has a 1 in 4 chance of inheriting an autosomal recessive condition . Further diagnostic invasive testing like an amniocentesis is necessary to confirm the possibility. Fortunately, care for rare diseases has improved dramatically in recent years.
""Many more of these conditions are treatable after birth,"" says Norton. ""And treatment starting right at the time of birth may improve the outcomes. In some cases we can even start treatment during pregnancy.""
Norton says the advent of more advanced testing stirred a lot of fear among practitioners that abortion rates would simultaneously rise, but that's not what preliminary studies are showing.
Why scanning for more diseases isn't always better
If you're the type of parent who does want as much information as possible, you may be inclined to take the most comprehensive test on the market. However, Aleks Rajkovic, chief genomics officer at UCSF, cautions families attracted to extensive panels.
""A lot of them are overkill,"" says Rajkovic. ""Some panels are testing for very rare disorders that have only been seen in a single family, so the likelihood of a client ever actually having the variation is infinitely small.""
Plus, he says extremely rare disease are usually not well studied or understood, so it's very hard for doctors to offer helpful information about what a prognosis could entail.
Fortunately Shara's little girl, Kaiya, is a healthy 5-month-old. When asked if Shara would go back and take the genetic test again, she pauses, but then nods yes.
Even though she spent months fretting over the tiny possibility her child wasn't ok, she says the anxiety she dealt with was better than not knowing anything all. Her advice to future parents is think carefully about whether more information will, for them, be reassuring or just another thing to worry about.
Norton agrees. She hopes families focus on a key fact: 97 percent of babies are born perfectly healthy.

Spring Allergies? Sublingual Immunotherapy Tablets Might Help : Shots - Health News : NPR,www.npr.org,Allison Aubrey,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/08/710243786/seasonal-sniffles-immunotherapy-tablets-can-replace-allergy-shots-for-some-aller,"Enlarge this image A new treatment for allergies is gaining popularity. Sublingual immunotherapy works to tame the immune response, much like allergy shots. Getty Images Getty Images A new treatment for allergies is gaining popularity. Sublingual immunotherapy works to tame the immune response, much like allergy shots.
Getty Images Sneezing, runny nose, congestion, or irritated eyes? Yes, we hear you: The misery of seasonal allergies is real. A lot of people find temporary relief with over-the-counter medications, but these don't treat the cause.
As we head into grass pollen season over the next few months, here's an option to consider: Many allergists now prescribe immunotherapy tablets, which work in the same way as allergy shots, to some of their patients with grass allergies.
But unlike allergy shots, which require frequent trips to the doctor, you can take the tablets at home. ""It's a little wafer you put under your tongue, and it dissolves in about 10 seconds,"" says allergist Mike Tankersley , who practices in Memphis, Tenn.
The treatment, known as sublingual immunotherapy, or SLIT, is more convenient than shots and has been shown to be safe . But it won't work for everyone. Each tablet targets just one allergy. There are four FDA-approved tablet products on the market to treat grass pollens, house dust mites and ragweed.
""I've had several patients who have been very happy with having something to take at home,"" Tankersley says.
According to a recent survey by the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, 73 percent of allergists now prescribe these immunotherapy tablets to some of their patients. Since these products were approved, starting five years ago, ""there's been a significant change in practice in the United States,"" Tankersley says.
Tankersley, who also serves as vice chair of the ACAAI's Committee on Immunotherapy and Diagnostics, says he still recommends allergy shots to the majority of patients because most of them have multiples allergies. Shots can be formulated to target all of the allergies in one shot.
Tankersley says he recommends this quiz from ACAAI for patients trying to decide whether shots or tablets are the best option.
Like allergy shots, the tablets are a form of immunotherapy, which can alter your immune system. It's a complex response, but one part of what's going on when you take the shots or tablets is your body can produce regulatory cells ""that suppress the immune response,"" explains Harold Nelson , an allergist and immunologist at National Jewish Health in Denver. In other words, immunotherapy can put a cap on the immune reaction and tamp down symptoms.
Over the very long term, Nelson says, when immunotherapy works well, ""the whole balance in the immune system is restored to pretty much that which is seen in non-allergic people.""
The tablets work best if you have just one or two main allergies that bother you. For instance, if grass pollen is your problem, there are two tablet products to fight grass allergies.
""If you live in a place like the Willamette Valley of Oregon or Northern California where grass is the predominant allergen, and that's what really bothers you, then the tablets are great,"" Nelson says.
The pollen from ragweed, which is found in many regions of the U.S., causes allergy symptoms in up to 23 million people. And the ragweed tablet has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment . Similarly, house dust mite allergies — which don't have much of a seasonal ebb and flow — can be treated effectively with the dust mite tablet, according to research . The grass pollen tablets are approved for adults and children (age 5 and older). The ragweed and dust mite tablets are approved for people 18 and older.
So far, there's no sublingual immunotherapy approved in the U.S. for tree pollen, which drives early spring allergies. In Europe, there's a tablet developed to treat birch allergies , which Nelson says could potentially be effective against some oak allergies. And in Japan there's an approved tablet for Japanese cedar, which might be effective in treating some cedar and juniper allergies seen in the U.S. Tankersley says allergists are hopeful that over the next several years a tablet for some tree pollen allergies may be available in the U.S.
What if you have two main allergies that bother you? Say, grass allergies in the late spring or summer and ragweed , which is often called hay fever and tends to spike in mid-September. Can you take both tablets? ""Yes, you can,"" says Nelson.
There's evidence for both safety and efficacy , Nelson explains, for taking two immunotherapy tablets simultaneously. But typically the tablets are started at different times, Nelson says. One drawback is that some insurance plans won't cover two tablets at the same time. However, with tablets, you don't have the copay that may come with office visits.
Many people get allergy relief with over-the-counter nasal steroids such as Flonase and Nasacort and anti-histamines. And Tankersley says they can be effective at treating symptoms. But unlike allergy shots and immunotherapy tablets, these medicines don't address the root cause of the problem.
""That's the big advantage of immunotherapy,"" he says. ""We're really shooting for a cure."""
Israel's Netanyahu Makes Dramatic Campaign Pledge Ahead Of Election : NPR,www.npr.org,Daniel Estrin,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/710953464/israels-netanyahu-makes-dramatic-campaign-pledge-ahead-of-election,"Israel's Netanyahu Makes Dramatic Campaign Pledge Ahead Of Election Israel's Netanyahu Makes Dramatic Campaign Pledge Ahead Of Election Embed Embed
Prime Minister Netanyahu says he will annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank if he is re-elected. Netanyahu made the surprising announcement ahead of Tuesday's election.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Israelis go to the polls tomorrow, and voters are faced with one main question - should Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stay in power? He has been in office for a decade, and if he's re-elected, he'll be on track to become the longest-serving prime minister in Israel's history. Netanyahu is, however, facing some big challenges this go-round, corruption charges against him, and his toughest competitor in years, former Military Chief of Staff Benny Gantz. As the race entered its final days, Netanyahu made a dramatic campaign pledge. He promised to annex parts of the occupied West Bank.
NPR's Daniel Estrin is in Jerusalem with more. Good morning, Daniel.
DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Good morning.
MARTIN: So Netanyahu wants to extend Israel's control over the West Bank. What exactly did he say about this?
ESTRIN: He said he's going to gradually impose sovereignty over Jewish settlements there. In other words, we're keeping Israelis in the West Bank forever - no negotiating on that. Is he serious? It's a last-minute campaign pledge. He wants to rally votes. It would cause an uproar in the world, but his party really wants him to do it. And if he wins re-election, he could take steps towards doing that. But for Palestinians looking at this, it's just another example of how far peace seems.
MARTIN: How are his odds? I mean, is he expected to win, despite these challenges we mentioned?
ESTRIN: It's a really close race. There's a former military general trying to beat him, and he's a centrist. But the polls are showing that most Israelis are going to be voting for right-wing parties, and that would give Netanyahu the best chance of forming a coalition and winning. I was speaking to some voters last night in the market, some young voters, who said, well, Netanyahu's done a good job. We're just sick of him after 10 years. And they are going to be voting for candidates even further to the right of him.
I also met a young high school civics teacher, Yahov Shudmi (ph), who, he says he teaches at an elite high school in Jerusalem that tends to be more liberal, but in their mock elections, there was strong support for right-wing candidates.
MARTIN: That's so interesting. I mean, and this is because of Netanyahu, right? I mean, he has steadily moved Israel to the right under his leadership. What have been the broader consequences of that?
ESTRIN: Well, attitudes toward democracy have changed a lot here. Israel has always considered itself both Jewish and democratic. But Netanyahu's government has been prioritizing Israel's Jewish character. Trust in the Supreme Court has dropped. A lot of Israelis are seeing the court as too left-wing. And calling someone a leftist here is a curse word, almost.
Netanyahu has also embraced many nationalist populist leaders around the world. You might call a lot of them bordering on authoritarian. But a lot of Israelis will say, you know, Israel has had a great 10 years. Unemployment is down, the economy's doing well. And yet, society has really changed. And I think Yedidia Stern from The Israel Democracy Institute - I spoke with him, and he summed this up really well.
YEDIDIA STERN: While he was doing such great things for us in order to sustain his position, he was dividing society. This is tragic.
ESTRIN: And he's referring to Netanyahu there.
MARTIN: Right. He also has had a famously close relationship with President Trump. For Israeli voters, does that help, hurt, or do they not care?
ESTRIN: Well, Trump appears in Netanyahu's campaign ads. And I think many Israelis are impressed by Netanyahu's ties with Trump. But I think what they're thinking about more in these elections is if they want someone new, or do they want more Netanyahu?
MARTIN: NPR's Daniel Estrin from Jerusalem for us. Thank you so much, Daniel. We appreciate it.

Trump Confirms Secretary Nielsen Is Leaving Department Of Homeland Security : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/710953492/trump-confirms-secretary-nielsen-is-leaving-department-of-homeland-security,"David Greene talks to former Department of Homeland Security press secretary David Lapan about Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stepping down after months of rumors that Trump was displeased with her work.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Kirstjen Nielsen may be best remembered as the public face of President Trump's zero tolerance immigration policy that led to the separation of thousands of migrant families who crossed the border illegally. This is Nielsen, the Homeland Security secretary, announcing the policy last summer.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN: What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law. Everyone is subject to prosecution. When DHS refers a case against a parent or legal guardian for criminal prosecution, the parent or legal guardian will be placed into the U.S. Marshals Service custody for pretrial determination, pursuant to an order by a federal judge, and any accompanying child will be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services and will be reclassified as an unaccompanied alien child.
GREENE: Kirstjen Nielsen there. Well, yesterday President Trump announced that Secretary Nielsen has resigned. This follows months of rumors that she was clashing with the administration internally over its border policies, even as she defended them publicly. The president also said that the current commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Kevin McAleenan, would become acting secretary.
David Lapan is with me. He is former press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security. He and Nielsen worked together at the department when it was led by Secretary John Kelly. He's also a retired Marine colonel who spent 30 years in the military. Thanks so much for being here.
DAVID LAPAN: Good morning, David.
GREENE: So what do you make of this resignation? Why is Kirstjen Nielsen leaving?
LAPAN: Well, it's certainly clear, as you mentioned, that she's been at the point of this immigration issue. She's been in a pressure cooker, not only in the position, but with the White House. So I can imagine, over the months that this has gone on, it's been very difficult for her to try to lead the entire Department of Homeland Security with a president who is very much overly focused on one aspect of DHS' mission, and that's the border enforcement.
GREENE: So is it more a matter of micromanagement, dealing with a boss who is just very interested in the subject that you cover? Or were there fundamental disagreements between her and the president on his border policies?
LAPAN: I don't have that level of insight to know exactly what it is. I suspect it's a little of both. Again, the president's made it very clear that that he feels very strongly about this topic, and as somebody trying to lead the department, you're going to be subject to getting his views and his frustrations very directly.
GREENE: When she defended the policy that was so controversial leading to family separation, I mean, did you think that you were seeing someone who believed in that policy or who was representing her boss?
LAPAN: My view is that she was representing her boss, and in many ways, again, that's the role that the secretary plays. Remember, too, that what really started that policy, or what led to that, was the zero tolerance policy put in place by the attorney general. So at the time, I thought that should have been the attorney general that they're having to send the policy and not the secretary of Homeland Security.
GREENE: What do you think this departure means for the president's border policies? I mean, he also said that he's dropping his nominee to head ICE, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The president said that he wants to go in a tougher direction. I mean, what does all this mean, and what does a tougher direction mean?
LAPAN: Well, it certainly doesn't bode well that, again, the signature issue for this president has been about border enforcement and immigration, and now you're walking into a situation with no transition. Remember, Secretary Nielsen's resignation letter was effective yesterday. So there's no transition period, and you're going to have an acting secretary of Homeland Security, you're going to have an acting commissioner of Border - Customs and Border Protection, and you're going to have an acting director of ICE, all at the same time; a lot of confusion, a lot of missed opportunities.
So if the president feels strongly about immigration, introducing more confusion into the system doesn't seem to be a good way to approach it.
GREENE: I mean, one of the tougher policies that President Trump has talked about is the idea of closing the southern border between the United States and Mexico. I mean, from your experience within this administration, do you think that is just a threat, or do you think that's serious?
LAPAN: I think it's just a threat - one, because it's physically impossible to do, and two, because of the impact that that would have on legal trade that goes across that border every single day, millions and millions of dollars. So the economic damage that that would cause I think would keep the president from following through, but he's also shown, again, that he believes threats are a way to get people to change their behavior.
GREENE: We just have a few seconds left, but in a sentence or two, can you sort of summarize what you think is Kirstjen Nielsen's legacy?
LAPAN: Well, unfortunately, again, I think she's going to be known specifically for this issue, when she came to the job with lots of skills in cybersecurity and other - and tried to do those things within the context of being secretary. But unfortunately, I think her legacy is going to be just this issue.
GREENE: David Lapan was former press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security. Thanks a lot.
LAPAN: Thank you.

"First Listen: Bruce Hornsby, 'Absolute Zero' : NPR",www.npr.org,Jason Heller,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/710363082/first-listen-bruce-hornsby-absolute-zero,"Enlarge this image Bruce Hornsby's Absolute Zero is out April 12 on Thirty Tigers. Courtesy Courtesy of the artist Bruce Hornsby's Absolute Zero is out April 12 on Thirty Tigers.

Ever since Bruce Hornsby hit the public consciousness with his 1986 hit single ""The Way It Is,"" he's made plenty of music that's just as organic and warm as that song, up to and including his body of work with The Grateful Dead . But the keyboardist also has a more technical and conceptual side — and that's evident in every nook and cranny of Absolute Zero . Hornsby's new album is as melodic as his past oeuvre, most of which is from more traditional, singer-songwriter cloth, but it's also a fascinating and absorbing peek into the veteran musician's love of avant-garde classical, jazz and progressive rock.
The song titles alone are hints that Hornsby is up to something. ""Voyager One,"" ""Fractals,"" ""Echolocation,"" ""Absolute Zero"": They're all names that could have appeared on one of the 1970s releases from the legendary jazz label ECM. And sure enough, one of ECM's staple signees in the '70s, the virtuoso jazz drummer Jack DeJohnette , makes a guest appearance on Absolute Zero 's title track, a minimalist meditation on time and perception that evokes an uncanny illusion of weightlessness. ""Voyager One,"" on the other hand, is pleasantly frantic, propelled by a tight funk-fusion groove and Hornsby's playfully spry vamping on the piano.
Hornsby has never been shy about inviting special guests to play on his albums, and in addition to Jack DeJohnette, Bon Iver 's Justin Vernon makes an appearance on two of Absolute Zero 's most compelling cuts. On ""Cast-Off,"" Hornsby and Vernon are joined by Bon Iver drummer Sean Carey , and together they forge a gentle, undulating excursion through rejection and isolation — but with enough emotional distance to render the song more dreamlike than anguished, all tied together with sumptuous vocal harmonies. And on ""Meds,"" the two welcome yMusic's Rob Moose as well as the acclaimed guitarist and composer Blake Mills . It's a heavy song, fractured and psychedelic, but with an underlying sweetness and vulnerability that counterbalances its jarring, avant-pop vibe.
One of the most moving collaborations on the album, though, is with Robert Hunter, longtime lyricist for The Grateful Dead. He contributes poetry to the track ""Take You There (Misty),"" which ends Absolute Zero on a note that seems, at first, to be a departure from the rest of the album's sculpted abstraction. It's not far from the sentimental, emotive songwriting of ""That's The Way It Is,"" complete with Hornsby's Hunter-penned admission that ""If your heart says yes / I won't say no."" It comes across almost corny at first — that is, until Hornsby shows his true hand and conducts the song into an extended bridge of deconstructed atonality.
It's a breathtaking move, especially when he repeats ""If your heart says yes / I won't say no"" while dangling over a disorienting chasm of shifting time signatures and chamber-orchestra pileups. It's closer to The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway -era Genesis than anything The Grateful Dead ever did. Far from a conventional Hornsby album, Absolute Zero is the sound of an artist subverting expectations and pulling it off brilliantly. At this point in his career, Hornsby could easily coast on writing cozy songs and settling for that. Thankfully for us, he's still up for an adventure."

The operator failed to recognize that the baby was in cardiac arrest, meaning that his heart had stopped and he was not breathing, according to three emergency medical experts who reviewed a recording of the 911 call.
Kayana Szymczak for ProPublica This story is part of a collaboration between The Public's Radio and the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.
Conner had just gotten out of the shower and gone back downstairs to where his infant son was napping. Barbara heard Conner scream and ran up the stairs of her home in Warwick, R.I.
Conner handed her 6-month-old Alijah, who was limp.
Barbara tried to stay calm as she carried her grandson into the living room. She'd watched medical shows on TV where they did CPR on babies.
""He's turning purple!"" Barbara shouted as her daughter, Jessica, spoke to a 911 operator. (We're not using last names at the family's request to protect their privacy.)
""Do we give him mouth-to-mouth? What do we do?"" Jessica, the baby's aunt, asked the 911 operator at one point.
She never got a good answer.
The 911 operator — whom officials refused to identify — asked the same questions repeatedly, wasting crucial time. She gave incorrect information. And she failed to recognize that the baby was in cardiac arrest, meaning that his heart had stopped and he was not breathing, according to three emergency medical experts who reviewed a recording of the 911 call obtained by Barbara and provided to The Public's Radio.
The call on that Friday morning in February 2018 lasted nearly four minutes, at which point emergency medical services personnel arrived. During the call, the 911 operator never instructed the family in how to perform a basic, potentially lifesaving treatment: cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR.
By the time the baby arrived at the hospital, it was too late. Alijah was dead.
""I've listened to thousands of calls,"" said Dr. Jeff J. Clawson, medical director for the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch, a nonprofit in Salt Lake City. ""I would say that this particular call is in the top 15 worst calls I've ever heard in my life, maybe in the top 10.""
When it comes to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests such as this one, among the most serious calls the 911 emergency system handles, Rhode Island seems set up to fail, experts in emergency medical dispatch say.
The American Heart Association says that providing CPR instructions over the phone for emergency 911 calls involving cardiac arrest is the standard of care. Knowing how to perform CPR in person, experts say, is very different from instructing someone to do it by phone, akin to the difference between knowing how to tie your shoes and trying to explain it by phone to someone who has never done it before.
But there are no national training requirements for 911 call-takers. And the United States is a patchwork of different systems where performance varies widely.
On average, about one in 10 people in the U.S. who go into cardiac arrest outside a hospital survives. But even in a small state like Rhode Island, experts say, the survival rate could double or triple with earlier CPR — potentially saving hundreds of more lives a year.
The benefits are well documented. Seattle launched its program in the 1980s. ""They saw very quickly that they were literally snatching lives from the jaws of death among patients who had cardiac arrest in their homes and in the community,"" said Dr. Mickey Eisenberg, medical director of King County Emergency Medical Services.
At the urging of groups like the American Heart Association, Louisiana, Wisconsin and Kentucky passed laws last year requiring 911 call-takers and other emergency dispatchers to be trained in telephone CPR.
For the roughly half of Americans who don't know CPR, as well as others who are reluctant to perform it, the guidance they receive from a 911 operator can be crucial.
""I continue to see cases where I think that we could have saved people, and that's driving me crazy,"" said Dr. Joseph R. Lauro, an emergency physician affiliated with Brown University. ""It's something that we can do. It's something that's been studied. It's something that happens elsewhere. So why the hell aren't we doing it?""
Rhode Island public safety officials have defended the way their system is set up, pointing out that call-takers are certified in CPR and basic first aid. A spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety said in an email that officials were prohibited from discussing specifics of the 911 call involving Alijah, citing state confidentiality laws. The agency also declined to answer questions about the call-taker, who was not identified in the recording.
The final autopsy report, which Barbara shared with The Public's Radio, said the baby had been propped on his left side with a bottle in his bassinet. ""He was later found unresponsive on his back.""
The report states the cause of death as ""sudden unexplained infant death.""
Doctors who reviewed the 911 call, Alijah's autopsy report and a patient care report prepared by the local fire department said it's impossible to know whether Alijah would have survived with earlier intervention.
Throughout the investigation of Alijah's death, the baby's aunt, Jessica, said nobody asked them about the emergency response to their 911 call or told them it had been mishandled.
""I mean, there were a million other questions,"" Jessica said. ""But no one ever said, 'You know, what was the 911 call like? Did they give you clear instructions?' ""
Barbara shook her head. ""Not once,"" she said. ""None of them.""

Rwandans Remember Hundreds Of Thousands Of Genocide Victims,www.npr.org,Jackie Northam,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/710953478/rwandans-remember-hundreds-of-thousands-of-genocide-victims,"This week it will be 25 years since the genocide in Rwanda took the lives of more than 800,000 people — mostly from the minority Tutsi tribe — over a three-month period in 1994.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Just this past Friday, a federal jury in Boston convicted a Rwandan man of taking part in that country's genocide 25 years ago. This conviction comes as Rwanda, this week, marks the genocide that took the lives of more than 800,000 people, mostly from minority Tutsi tribe. NPR's Jackie Northam covered the genocide right from its opening days and joins me now. Hi, Jackie.
JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Morning, David.
GREENE: Start with this federal courtroom in Boston. Who was this Rwandan man?
NORTHAM: His name is Jean Leonard Teganya and he's 48 years old. Federal prosecutors said he took part in the rapes and killings of Tutsis near a hospital in southern Rwandan town of Butare during the genocide. And Teganya was a medical student at the hospital at the time.
GREENE: So how does he go from carrying out attacks in Rwanda 25 years ago to a federal courtroom in the United States in 2019?
NORTHAM: Yeah. Towards the end of the genocide, Teganya, along with hundreds of other thousands of Rwandans, fled into what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. In a number of years, he made his way to Canada. He was denied asylum there and was facing deportation, so he crossed into the U.S. and applied for asylum here.
Now, David, the Rwandan government has been very active in going after people who participated in the genocide and encourages countries to prosecute them, which is what the U.S. did in Teganya's case. But what's interesting is, the U.S. did not try Teganya for genocide. That's really difficult to prove. What they got him on was lying on his asylum application, when he said he did not take part in the genocide.
GREENE: What is it like personally for you? I mean, you were there in the three months while this genocide was taking place, covering the aftermath. I mean, to see someone connected to it 25 years later, still - now, today.
NORTHAM: Sure. I mean, I went in four days after the genocide started. And the first stop was Butare, which is where this fellow was from. And, you know, Rwanda, during the genocide, was horrific. Just the sheer scale of the brutality and the butchery is still hard to fathom. And it was extremely dangerous. So yeah, to sit in the courtroom in Boston, 25 years after the fact, and see someone who perpetrated some of these atrocities was unnerving.
And Teganya took the stand and he was wearing a suit and tie. And he answered questions for several hours, saying, he was just trying to protect the Tutsis. But the jury deliberated less than three hours and convicted him.
GREENE: So Rwanda's going to be remembering this period now, 25 years later. Am I right? Isn't the story of Rwanda since then something incredibly positive? I mean, it's a peaceful country, it's been stable, grappling with this history. And there are even reports of victims or the families of victims living next door to people carried out some of the attacks. I mean, that's extraordinary.
NORTHAM: Yeah, that's right. I've talked to many people with human rights groups and people who study Rwanda, particularly after the genocide. And they say, one of the reasons that there has been this relative stability for so long is because the Rwandan government has tried to deliver accountability. They've gone after people responsible for the atrocities, even those who played an insignificant role.
And yeah, there are a number of accounts of people who have done their time, asked for forgiveness, and gone back to live into their communities. I find this remarkable, you know? I talked to one man after the genocide. He was in prison. And he had clubbed to death some of his very close neighbors. In fact, he was a godfather to one of their children. But that didn't stop him from killing them. And this was common during the genocide. So yeah, it's remarkable that there has been this level of reconciliation in Rwanda, this level of forgiveness.
GREENE: Jackie, thanks so much.
NORTHAM: Thank you, David.
GREENE: That's NPR's Jackie Northam, who covered something that should never be forgotten - the genocide in Rwanda 25 years ago.

Robert Caro's 'Working' Details His Life On The Job : NPR,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/710953485/robert-caros-working-details-his-life-on-the-job,"NPR's Steve Inskeep talks to Robert Caro about his book: Working, which is an uncharacteristically short memoir. Caro says he was a fast-writing newspaperman until he recalled a professor's advice.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
What can you do in a decade? Well, for one author and historian, a decade means writing a single book. And Steve Inskeep spoke with him about his book, his process and time.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Is it fair to think of you as an obsessive researcher?
ROBERT CARO: (Laughter) I don't know how I'd deny that, actually.
INSKEEP: Robert Caro has been writing books since the 1960s. He investigated a man who built roads, bridges and parks in his native New York. The thousand-page biography of Robert Moses launched Caro's lifelong examination of powerful figures.
He's so thorough that his life has had time for only one more. He's completing a five-volume biography of Lyndon Johnson, which fans hope Caro finishes before he dies. This week, Caro publishes an uncharacteristically short memoir called ""Working."" He says he was a fast-writing newspaperman until he recalled the advice of a writing professor at Princeton.
CARO: He says, you are never going to achieve what you want to achieve unless you stop thinking with your fingers. So I determined that I was going to make myself think things all the way through.
INSKEEP: What's that mean in practice? Caro writes longhand to slow down. He doesn't even write until he has researched for years. At 83, Caro has lived through an almost incomprehensible acceleration of information, but his style remains the same. He interviews people for hours. He reads thousands of documents at places like the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Texas.
Caro explored the way that Johnson, a relatively powerless Texas congressman, became powerful starting in 1940. He became a conduit from Texas businessmen to other politicians who needed campaign money.
CARO: There was an old fundraiser in Washington - what we now call a political fixer - Tommy Corcoran. I asked him what happened in October, 1940. He said to me - money, kid, money. He says - but you're never going to be able to write about it, kid, because Lyndon Johnson never put anything in writing.
But I'm going through these boxes of pages that have no interest to me. And all of a sudden, there is a list - an amazing list. It was typed by one of his assistants. There are two typed columns. In the left column is the name of the congressman and the district he's in. And the second column is how much money he wants - incredibly low amounts then.
Lyndon, I need $500 for last-minute ads. Lyndon, they're trying to steal the election at the polls. I need $1,500 for poll watchers - that sort of thing. But in the left-hand margin, in Lyndon Johnson's own handwriting, is what he decides to do with each of these requests. If he's going to give the guy everything he asked for, he writes OK. If he's going to give him part of what he asks for, he says OK, 500 or OK, 300 or whatever amount he's decided on. But on some of them, he writes none.
So you see right there how economic power of the money of Texas oilmen created political power - Lyndon Johnson's first political power.
INSKEEP: Interviews are an important part of your work, which I note because you write history. Not every historian would go try to find living people or even be able to, depending on their subject.
CARO: I guess that's right (laughter). But I found - if you looked at my notebooks that I take notes for my interviews, you'd find, written there, big letters - SU - over and over again. SU means shut up.
(LAUGHTER)
INSKEEP: What do you mean by that?
CARO: Well, it means I talk too much (laughter). So silence is a great weapon. You know, you ask somebody a question, he doesn't want to answer it. If I just remember to shut up - more often than you'd think - after a while, there's a human need to fill silences. So they'll fill it by telling you what you want to know.
INSKEEP: There's a lot that's valuable in this book, so don't take this the wrong way. But did you have a moment of asking yourself, am I maybe just procrastinating instead of writing the big thing?
CARO: No. No. I have to say no, I didn't. I just felt...
INSKEEP: Are you procrastinating instead of writing the big thing?
CARO: Well, I'm back writing the big thing right now (laughter). I'm doing publicity or interviews like this because this book is published. But I'm already back working on the fifth volume of the Lyndon Johnson book.
INSKEEP: Have you finished your research in the Lyndon Johnson Presidential Library?
CARO: Well, let me answer you honestly. I think I've finished my research, but I've thought that a lot of times before.
INSKEEP: I'm trying to imagine what it's like to be a researcher sitting in a presidential library. What are the sounds? What does it feel like to be there going through documents?
CARO: Oh, fascinating. On the 10th floor of the library is a reading room. And you pick out the boxes that you want to see. There's only room for 15 boxes on your cart at a time. So you're always - I'm always asking for more than 15.
So the archivist brings up 15, and they put them all in your cart. You ask what a sound is. I'm going to tell you, the sound - and it's a really depressing sound. Each box, with the 800 pages, is heavy. So each box, there's a little thud as it lands on this cart next to your desk.
INSKEEP: (Laughter).
CARO: You're sitting there with all this work and there's a thud, thud, thud. And each thud is going to be a couple of days at least.
INSKEEP: We're in the middle of this momentous political time, as you know very well...
CARO: Yes. Yes.
INSKEEP: ...Where people are obsessively paying attention to the news day, after day, after day. Does your instinct tell you that we won't really understand what is happening now until 20 years from now - or 50 years from now - when some historian obsessively goes through whatever records remain then?
CARO: Yes, Steve. That is what I feel. As I look at Lyndon Johnson's life, you know, the first thing you do is you read all the newspapers about 1965 or something. Then you read the magazine articles. Then you turn to people who were involved, then you interview them. Then you turn to the actual papers, the things that were going back and forth in the White House.
And over and over again you say, oh, so that's what really happened. It's like the shadow to the substance. The substance doesn't become clear - and I don't think being in the age of the computer and the email changes this very much at all. I don't think it becomes clear until some years after the event, you suddenly see the different layers that were involved.

INSKEEP: Robert Caro, thanks for the time.
CARO: It was very nice talking to you again.

Minnesota Has An Opening For A Historian To Manage Iconic Lighthouse : NPR,www.npr.org,Euan Kerr,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/710953529/minnesota-has-an-opening-for-a-historian-to-manage-iconic-lighthouse,"Lee Radzak is retiring as the Split Rock lighthouse keeper after 36 years — welcoming 160,000 visitors a year. The Minnesota Historical Society is launching a search for a replacement.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Imagine 160,000 people dropping by your house every year. That's been Lee Radzak's life for the last 3 1/2 decades looking after the iconic Split Rock Lighthouse on Lake Superior's north shore. But Radzak is retiring, and his job is back on the market. Minnesota Public Radio's Euan Kerr reports.
(SOUNDBITE OF WATER RUNNING)
EUAN KERR, BYLINE: On a fine day, Split Rock is gorgeous. 40 miles off the shore from Duluth, the lighthouse is perched atop a 160-foot cliff. The enormous Lake Superior sparkles below. For lighthouse lovers - and apparently, there are a lot - it oozes romance. It's here Lee Radzak has answered the same questions again and again.
LEE RADZAK: If my wife and I are sitting on the front porch, they say, you live here? Yes. Do you live here year-round? Yes. Oh, it must be lonely. And then you want to say, well, look behind you. There's 50 people standing there listening to you.
KERR: In summer, Split Rock attracts 2,500 visitors a day. There are far fewer in winter, but they still come, even when it's below zero and the storms blow so hard, the spray coats the buildings with ice. Lee Radzak is not the lighthouse keeper. His title is historic site manager. And he's here to tell the lighthouse's story.
RADZAK: As a lighthouse goes, it's kind of a Johnny-come-lately. It wasn't built until 1909.
KERR: There was no road to Split Rock then. A boat dropped off the keepers in the spring and picked them up in the fall. There were three families that lived here pretty much on their own, other than some boat traffic going up and down the shore, and five miles to the closest town for their mail.
(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)
KERR: Radzak leads the way up the lighthouse stairs to the lamp room and the site's prized possession.
RADZAK: This lens has been in here since 1910.
KERR: The keepers lit it with a kerosene lamp to warn ships away from the rocky shore. The 252 cut glass prisms in the lens focused the light into a 7-foot beam visible for 22 miles. And on days when they couldn't see, they sounded the foghorns.
(SOUNDBITE OF FOGHORN BLOWING)
KERR: Split Rock had changed by 1983, when Lee Radzak moved in. It was still remote, but Highway 61 - the one Bob Dylan famously revisited - now passes just a few hundred yards away. The Coast Guard decommissioned the lighthouse in 1969. Razak arrived as a newly-married man to manage the site for the Minnesota Historical Society. He and his wife thought they'd give it a few years. But then they had two children, and they stayed.
Early on, Radzak oversaw the building of the visitor's center and learned about budgets and managing a summer staff of 30. Lee Radzak's last day is Friday, April 12. An interim will fill in for the summer. Minnesota Historical Society manager Ben Leonard will lead the search for a replacement.
BEN LEONARD: This job is going to be probably the hardest job to fill in the Historical Society because people think about the view, what they don't think about - the emails or the reports or the HR issues because those aren't romantic.
KERR: Leonard's looking for a historian with the patience and skills to manage crowds, harsh weather, and deal with the occasional bear. For NPR News, I'm Euan Kerr at the Split Rock Lighthouse in northern Minnesota.

"As Violence Escalates In Libya, U.S. Pulls Troops Out",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/710953508/as-violence-escalates-in-libya-u-s-pulls-troops-out,"Rachel Martin talks to Jeffrey Feltman, former U.N. under-secretary-general for Political Affairs, about the U.S. military pulling out a contingent of its troops from Libya's capital Tripoli.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
More than seven years after the death of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, Libya is on the brink of civil war. Warring militias there are locked in a power struggle for control of the capital city Tripoli. To the west, the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli. To the east, forces loyal to a general named Khalifa Haftar. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo released a statement urging Haftar to immediately stop his military operations. And over the weekend, the U.S. military pulled its troops out of the country.
Jeffrey Feltman served as the U.N. undersecretary-general for political affairs until last year, and he's in our studios with us this morning. Thanks so much for coming in.
JEFFREY FELTMAN: Thanks for inviting me. This is an important story.
MARTIN: It is, indeed. And as you well know, Libya has been unstable for a long time, ever since Moammar Gadhafi was unseated in 2011. President Obama described his handling of the aftermath of that as the, quote, ""worst mistake of his presidency."" Can you just help us understand what is happening right now?
FELTMAN: Yeah. Thank you. I mean, it is worth keeping in mind that despite the instability, despite the political chaos in Libya since 2011, this is not Syria. We have not seen the type of destruction, or fatalities or casualties that we've seen in Syria in the same period.
But what you have is, you have a government in Tripoli that's recognized internationally. So it has the support of the Security Council, but has been unable to build momentum to expand its control over the country facing, as you said in the introduction, a rival force in the east headed by General Haftar, who was once an officer in Gadhafi's army who's now moved his forces first south and now up on the edge of Tripoli, leading to the situation that's on the verge of civil war.
MARTIN: And Haftar is getting support from Russia. Right?
FELTMAN: Yes. Haftar traditionally has gotten support from Egypt, from the UAE, from France, for going against Islamists in eastern Libya. But now he also has the support of Russia, and he seems to have the support of Saudi Arabia. He had an important meeting with Mohammed bin Salman and King Salman in Riyadh on March 27. I think that that support from Russia, the support from Saudi Arabia, helps explain why he's moved now.
I think he's long wanted to do this. It's been an aspiration of his, but it's proving to be more difficult than he thought. He thought that he would be able to basically walk into Tripoli. And in fact, he's getting - he's facing considerable resistance. And that's one of the reasons why I think we should all welcome the strong, direct statement by Secretary of State Pompeo from last night.
MARTIN: So you think this was a good move by the Secretary of State to release this?
FELTMAN: It was absolutely, absolutely the right thing to do. There was a lot of ambiguity about the U.S. position. And I think Haftar was playing an ambiguity to hit to his advantage. And now there's no more ambiguity. What the U.S. needs to do now is sort of rally the international community, build support for taking measures against Haftar. There have been sanctions passed by the U.N. under U.S. leadership against others who've tried to use a military solution in Libya. I think it's time to think about that for Haftar, as well.
MARTIN: Why had the Trump administration been ambiguous, to use your word, when it comes to Libya?
FELTMAN: I think a couple of reasons. One is, you know, the Trump administration, I think, saw Libya as not our problem, not a U.S. problem. It was an African problem, an Arab problem, a European problem, but it wasn't a U.S. problem.
And second, I think the U.S. was hedging its bets a bit. You know, the government in Tripoli that's recognized had not really been able to expand its control. It was reliant on desperate local militias. And Haftar had gone after some very bad forces, Islamic forces, in the east. So I think the U.S. was hedging its bets.
But the U.S. has proven uniquely credible in trying to change the situation on the ground in Libya, as the Trump administration has shown twice in the past year or so. There was an oil crescent crisis last summer when Haftar tried to unilaterally seize the oil revenues of Libya for his own purposes. The U.S. pushed back against that successfully. And then second, in February, there was an attempt to keep one of Libya's largest oil fields off production. The U.S. again pushed back and got the field open.
So I think the U.S. has proven it can, when focused on Libya, make a real difference. And the Pompeo statement, I hope, is the beginning of a concerted international effort led by the U.S. to stop the move on Tripoli.
MARTIN: Jeffrey Feltman is the former U.N. undersecretary-general of political affairs at the U.N. Thank you so much for coming in this morning. We appreciate your context on this.
FELTMAN: Thank you very much.

How Students May Be Cheating Their Way Through College,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/710953499/how-students-may-be-cheating-their-way-through-college,"Concern is growing at the nation's colleges and universities about a burgeoning online market, where students can buy ghost-written essays. Schools are trying new tools to catch it.
National Contract Cheating: Colleges Crack Down On Ghostwritten Essays RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We've heard a lot in recent weeks about the cheating that happens to get kids into college, but schools are also focusing on how students may be cheating their way through school. There's a lot of concern specifically about students who don't do their work; instead, they buy ghostwritten essays online. Here's NPR's Tovia Smith.
TOVIA SMITH, BYLINE: It's not hard to understand the temptation; the pressure is enormous, the stakes high, and for some students, college-level work is a huge leap.
UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT: I was kind of lost on what to do. And, like, even though I did my best to manage, deadlines come closer and closer, and it's just the pressure.
SMITH: This student, a college freshman, says one night, when she was feeling particularly overwhelmed, she tweeted her frustration.
UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT: It was like, someone please help me write my essay, and within the first few minutes, it was, like, five, six replies.
SMITH: Send us the assignment; we'll write it for you, they offered. The student, who asked that her name not be used for fear of repercussions at school, picked one that cost $10 a page and breathed a sigh of relief. In the cat-and-mouse game of academic cheating, students know plagiarism will get caught by computer programs that automatically compare essays to a massive database of other writings. But to students like this one, buying an original essay seemed like a good workaround.
UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT: Technically, I don't think it's cheating because, like, you're paying someone to write an essay, which they don't plagiarize, but they write everything on their own.
SMITH: So they may not be plagiarizing, I say, but aren't you?
UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT: That's just kind of a difficult question to answer. I don't know how to feel about it. It's kind of like a gray area.
ASHLEY FINLEY: That - it just breaks my heart to think that this is where we're at.
SMITH: Ashley Finley with the Association of American Colleges and Universities says campuses are buzzing about how to curb the rise in what they call contract cheating. Obviously, students buying essays is not new, but Finley says what used to be a small side hustle has grown through the Internet into a global industry of so-called essay mills.
FINLEY: Definitely. This is really getting more and more serious. I think it's part of the brave new world, for sure.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Get instant help with your assignment.
SMITH: The essay mills market aggressively online.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Don't lag behind, join the majority.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Don't worry, be happy.
TRICIA BERTRAM GALLANT: Yeah, they - they're very crafty.
SMITH: Tricia Bertram Gallant, head of academic integrity at UC San Diego, says companies are brazen offline as well; they leaflet on campuses, post ads in toilet stalls and fly banners over Florida beaches on spring break. They also bait students with emails that look like they're from official college help centers and Bertram Gallant says they pay social media influencers to promote them.
BERTRAM GALLANT: It's very much a seduction. So you can maybe see why students could get drawn into the contract cheating world.
SMITH: YouTube has cracked down on essay mills, pulling thousands of videos that they say promote dishonest behavior. But new ones constantly pop up, and their hard sell flies in the face of their small print that essays should be used only as a guide, not as a final product.
Several essay mills declined or didn't answer our interview requests, but one called EduBirdie answered questions by email and offered up one of its writers. April Short (ph), a former teacher from Australia, says the idea that students may be turning in her work as theirs doesn't bother her.
APRIL SHORT: These kids are so time-poor, and I don't necessarily think that being able to create an essay is going to be a defining factor in a very long career. And I actually applaud students that look for options to get the job done and get it done well.
DAN ARIELY: Yeah, that's it. I mean, you know, this just shows you the extent of ability to rationalize all kinds of bad things we do.
SMITH: Duke University psychology professor Dan Ariely says the rise in contract cheating is especially worrisome because more begets more; dishonest behavior, he says, is not just about a few bad apples.
ARIELY: Instead, what we have is a lot, a lot of blemished apples, and we take the cues for our behavior from what we see people around us doing.
SMITH: To curb essay-buying, schools are starting to use new technology, just as they did to fight plagiarism.
BILL LOLLER: So the new product is called Authorship Investigate.
SMITH: Bill Loller with the company Turnitin says the new software inspects document metadata, like when it was created, by whom and how many times it was edited. Then it looks at style. Everyone has a kind of writing fingerprint, Loller says, like whether you double-space after a period or whether you use Oxford commas. By comparing that to a student's other work, Loller says, suspicions can be confirmed or alleviated in minutes.
LOLLER: At the end of the day, you get to a really good determination on whether the student wrote what they submitted or not.
SMITH: Eventually, schools hope students will get the message that buying essays is risky on many levels - some companies' essays have been horribly written and even plagiarized, and when buyers complained, some companies turned to blackmail, threatening to tell their school they were cheating.
But ultimately, experts say, fear of getting outed by shady businesses or by the latest technology may not deter students. Tricia Bertram Gallant from UC San Diego says the only right way to dissuade them from buying essays is to remind them why it's wrong.
BERTRAM GALLANT: If we engage in a technological arms race with the students, we won't win. Our solution has to be about creating a culture where integrity and ethics matter.
SMITH: And she says, only when learning is valued more than grades will students believe that cheating on essays is only cheating themselves. Tovia Smith, NPR News.

Morning News Brief,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/710953457/morning-news-brief,"Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is leaving her post. Israelis go to the polls Tuesday to decide if Prime Minister Netanyahu stays in power. And, U.S. troops evacuate from Libya.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
A month ago, Kirstjen Nielsen went before Congress and told a House committee this.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN: We face a crisis - a real, serious and sustained crisis at our borders. We have tens of thousands of illegal aliens arriving at our doorstep every month. We have drugs, criminals and violence spilling into our country every week.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
The secretary of Homeland Security was the person in charge of implementing President Trump's hard line on immigration, which included separating children from their families. President Trump confirmed Nielsen's departure in a tweet yesterday, thanking her for her service. The president also confirmed that the current commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency, the CBP - his name is Kevin McAleenan - he's going to serve as acting secretary.
GREENE: And let's talk about this move with NPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro. Hi, Domenico.
DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, David.
GREENE: So talk about Kirstjen Nielsen's time at Homeland Security. What is her legacy?
MONTANARO: Well, it was a controversial one. She oversaw the family separation policy that saw thousands of children separated from their parents and detained, including those seeking asylum. But she also often clashed with the president. He wanted her to go further in taking a hard line on clamping down, especially as migrant border crossings have gone up in recent months.
GREENE: So is that why she's leaving - the president wanted her to be even tougher than she was?
MONTANARO: He did. I mean, it's been a pretty rocky relationship. You know, Trump was pretty skeptical of her from the beginning because of her ties to the Bush administration and because she was pretty close to his former chief of staff, John Kelly.
But what we know now about her departure is that the - in the administration's that Nielsen met with Trump yesterday afternoon. After that meeting, she tendered their - her resignation. She touted her legacy. She tried to keep the focus on the fact that she tried to keep the border secure, but she expressed frustration with Congress and her ability within the law to be able to do more. The president wanted her to limit asylum-seekers, for example, who he last week said weren't people, but animals.
And now this is really a department that's facing a leadership crisis. Trump withdrew his nomination, remember, for the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement - ICE - and just named the head of Customs and Border Protection to lead the agency while he threatened to close the border last week.
GREENE: So a lot happening at a moment when there is going to be this leadership vacuum, it seems. And you mentioned ICE, Domenico. When the president dropped his nominee to lead that agency, he told reporters he wants a tougher direction. What does that mean for his immigration policy? And what does this mean in terms of the political challenges that a new secretary might face here?
MONTANARO: Right. Well, I mean, the new challenges are going to be the same as the old challenges. You know, a secretary is going to come in dealing with a president not happy about immigration law limitations, you know, who - somebody who's saying that the country is, quote, ""full"" - he tweeted last night - and asking the secretary to, quote, ""be creative about stopping immigration.""
You know, overall, though, I really do think - I mean, when you talk about the politics of this, we should remember this is less about any secretary and more about Trump himself. Curbing immigration was Trump's core, fundamental issue that helped launch him onto the national scene, really, and get elected. And we're talking here a year before he faces re-election before voters, he wants to continue to channel this grievance about demographic and social, cultural change in a country that's really at a pivot point on this issue.
MARTIN: There's also a lot of acting happening right now, we should just say.
MONTANARO: Yeah.
MARTIN: There is currently in the country not a confirmed secretary of defense and now an acting character in at Homeland Security.
MONTANARO: Absolutely.
GREENE: Acting is a new title, it seems like, in leadership in the country at the moment. NPR's Domenico Montanaro - Domenico, thanks. We appreciate it.
MONTANARO: You're so welcome.

GREENE: All right. Israelis are going to the polls tomorrow, really, with one main question to answer. Should Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remain in power?
MARTIN: He's been in office for a decade. And if he's re-elected, he'll be on track to become the longest-serving prime minister in Israel's history. But Netanyahu has some challenges this go-round - corruption charges against him, and he's facing his toughest competitor in years, a former military chief of staff named Benny Gantz. Polling suggests a close race in the final hours. And over the weekend, Netanyahu made a dramatic campaign pledge.
GREENE: And let's hear about that from NPR's Daniel Estrin, who is in Jerusalem. Good morning, Daniel.
DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning.
GREENE: So this pledge - Netanyahu saying that he would annex parts of the occupied West Bank - explain what that means and why it's so significant.
ESTRIN: He says he'll gradually impose sovereignty over Jewish settlements. He's basically saying, I'm keeping Israelis in the West Bank forever. That's not up for negotiation with the Palestinians. But this is a last-minute campaign promise. I think we have to take it with a grain of salt. He's trying to rally his base here. And the truth is that he has resisted this kind of move for years. It would draw really enormous international condemnation.
But you know what? There's a big but there. The Trump administration declined comment on Netanyahu's campaign promise about annexation. And his party really wants it to happen. And if he wins re-election, he could take steps towards that. And I think for Palestinians watching these elections, that's - it's a sign of how dim the prospects are for peace and also how little say they have in this election.
GREENE: So what are the polls suggesting at this point? I mean, what are Netanyahu's chances for staying in power?
ESTRIN: It's a really close race. This former military general who's trying to beat Netanyahu, he's a centrist. But polls are showing that most Israelis are going to vote for right-wing parties. There are, like - probably, like, a dozen parties running in this election. And if most Israelis vote for right-wing parties, that would give Netanyahu the best chance of forming a coalition and winning.
And last night, I was at the market here in Jerusalem. I spoke to some young voters drinking coffee. And they said, Netanyahu's done a good job. We're just sick of him after 10 years. But guess who they're going to vote for? They say that they're going to be voting for candidates even further to the right of Netanyahu.
And next to them, I met a young high school civics teacher, Yahav Shadmi (ph). And he says he's liberal. He teaches at an elite high school here that tends to be more liberal. But he said the school held mock elections, and there was strong support for right-wing candidates, even far-right candidates. Here's what he said.
YAHAV SHADMI: We could see that the radical racism discourse into the student's mind. Peace is not any option anymore. Even the left-wing parties don't really talk about peace. They talking about agreements.
GREENE: Well, Daniel, you've reported a lot on Israel's shift further and further to the right during Netanyahu's time in power. I mean, what - tell us about what you've learned.
ESTRIN: I've learned that attitudes toward democracy have changed here. Israel has always branded itself as being both Jewish and democratic. But Netanyahu's government has prioritized Israel's Jewish character. Trust in the Supreme Court has dropped. Calling someone leftist here has become a slur. And, you know, Israel also has had, really, a great 10 years. Unemployment is down. The economy's doing well. But society has changed, and people feel that society has been divided.
GREENE: NPR's Daniel Estrin reporting for us ahead of this election in Israel. Daniel's in Jerusalem. Daniel, thank you.
ESTRIN: Thank you, David.

GREENE: OK. The United States is evacuating its troops from Libya.
MARTIN: Right. They're doing so because there are fears of what could become a full-blown urban war in the capital city, Tripoli. They've already been - there have already been clashes between rival militias on the outskirts of Tripoli. A renegade military general is leading a rebel force that's trying to take over the capital. The U.N.-backed government in Tripoli has said that it's prepared to fight back.
GREENE: All right. Sudarsan Raghavan is the Washington Post's Cairo bureau chief and has been reporting on this tense moment in Libya. Sudarsan, welcome.
SUDARSAN RAGHAVAN: Good to be with you, David.
GREENE: So we should say, I mean, Libya has just been in - I mean, it's been unstable. It's been violent. It's been in chaos since Moammar Gadhafi was deposed, like, back in 2011. So explain why this situation is important and stands out.
RAGHAVAN: That's a very good question. Unlike 2014, the last time Khalifa Haftar - the renegade general you just mentioned - clashed intensively with militias in Tripoli, he now has stronger backing of portions of the international community, including France, the UAE, Egypt and Russia. And even though all these powers are now urging him to halt his offensive on Tripoli or show restraint, the fact is they supported and fueled his ambitions, gave him political legitimacy.
There's also much greater frustration among Libyans. Their economic woes have deepened since 2011, and they really want a solution. And with the U.N.-installed international crisis government, the international community now has more of a vested interest in Libya's success. And the U.N., as of now, as of this weekend, they're trying to reconcile the warring sides like no other time since 2011, trying to organize long-delayed elections. And these clashes now threaten to torpedo this reconciliation conference that is still, by the way, scheduled for this weekend.
GREENE: I mean, it sounds like things are particularly bad if we're hearing the United States pulling its forces out. They were there for peacekeeping purposes, right? I mean, what exactly led to this decision by the United States?
RAGHAVAN: Well, they were there now just for security purposes, but also to - for counterterrorism. You know, you still have a strong Islamic State presence around Libya. But the stated reason by the U.S. is - to leave, to evacuate - is that the security situation is worsening. But, you know, there's also concern that U.S. forces could possibly get entangled in the clashes. The U.S. backs the Tripoli government, but it also has opened lines of communication with Haftar. So they want to remain neutral. And really, the best way of doing that, at this moment, is to not be in Libya.
GREENE: And what is the current state of things in and around Tripoli right now? I mean, is - have these clashes gotten to a point where civilians are being threatened? Are they evacuating the city?
RAGHAVAN: Well, the picture is mixed. I mean, some residents we have contracted in Tripoli said they have fled their houses. Others are stockpiling food and staying inside their homes - always checking, you know, every hour for new information on the conflict, on how close it's to reaching their neighborhoods, via Facebook or cellphones.
But for residents in some areas by the coast that we spoke to, where the war has not yet reached, life is still normal. You know, there's traffic in the streets, and people are going to work. The - you know, the residents of Tripoli are accustomed to southern eruptions of militia violence.
GREENE: But this is a country that could be, I mean, dangerous for the world if it literally falls into total chaos.
RAGHAVAN: Absolutely. I mean, what you could see if it falls into total chaos is possibly, you know, the resurrection of the Islamic State - which once, by the way, had its own self-described caliphate in the city of Sirte. And also, you know, it could lead to more illegal migration. The Europeans are concerned about that from Libya, as well as its neighbors. So it can definitely affect the region and the world - any more chaos, that is.
GREENE: Sudarsan Raghavan is the Washington Post's Cairo bureau chief talking to us about the situation in Libya. Thanks for your time this morning.
RAGHAVAN: My pleasure.
