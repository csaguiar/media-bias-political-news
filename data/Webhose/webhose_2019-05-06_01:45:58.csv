Over 100 House Democrats Demand Extending Billions Worth of Green Energy Subsidies,www.szone.us,@Heritage,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.szone.us/showthread.php?p=248265,"Over 100 House Democrats Demand Extending Billions Worth of Green Energy Subsidies On 04.05.19 10:08 AM posted by Michael Bastasch More than 100 House Democrats are demanding legislation to extend billions of dollars worth of green tax subsidies to counteract the Trump administrations energy agenda and to prepare the U.S. for global warming. Democrats called for extending tax subsidies for green technologiesincluding wind turbines, solar panels, electric cars, energy efficiency, biofuels, and energy storagein a bid to counteract the policies of the Trump administration. Simply put, investments in clean energy will help the U.S. reduce carbon pollution, prepare our communities for the damaging effects of rising sea levels, severe weather and catastrophic wildfires, all the while supporting innovation and job creation positioning the U.S. to lead in a global clean energy economy, Democratic lawmakers, led by New York Rep. Paul Tonko, wrote in a letter to Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal, chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means. One of the letters signatories, Democratic Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Doyle, introduced legislation Thursday to extend investment tax credits to energy storage systems. Currently, energy storage only qualifies for tax subsidies when paired with a solar project. Democrats said the 2015 political deal to phase-out green subsidies was based on expectations Obama-era regulations would remain in place and that the U.S. would not withdraw from the Paris climate accord. President Donald Trumps energy dominance agenda frustrated Democrats plans of using regulations and legislation to force more solar onto the U.S. grid. The latest extension and phase-out of these clean-energy tax credits were intended to serve as a bridge to the implementation of the EPAs Clean Power Plan, among a suite of other regulations and policies to reduce carbon emissions, Democrats wrote. This is no longer the case. The letter was welcomed by green energy interests that stand to benefit from long-term tax subsidies. Clarifying the tax code for energy storage technologies is also a critical piece of the puzzle that would have technology-neutral benefits, Gregory Wetstone, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, said in a statement. The American Wind Energy Association* hailed *Doyles bill to extend subsidies to energy storage, which experts say is necessary to make renewables more reliable. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer made similar demands in a letter sent to Trump late in 2018, asking the president to support permanently extending green tax subsidies to fight global warming. At the same time, however, Democrats were also chafing at Trumps request to Congress for $5.7 billion for a southern border wall. The border wall fight eventually led to the longest U.S. government shutdown in history. Tax subsidies for wind and solar farms alone are expected to cost $32 billion through 2022, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. The so-called wind production tax credit and solar investment tax credit are currently set to expire in 2022. But now, Democrats want to extend them into the future as part of their climate agenda, which, if enacted, would mean billions more tax benefits to solar and wind companies. SEIA is pleased to see such strong support for clean energy priorities as laid out in this letter to Chairman Neal, said Erin Duncan, the vice president of congressional affairs at the Solar Energy Industries Association. As Congress explores solutions to address a wide range of concerns about climate, resilience, infrastructure, and jobs, we know that clean energy tax incentives work, Duncan said in an emailed statement.

The Brexit Shambles Stumbles On,www.szone.us,@Heritage,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.szone.us/showthread.php?p=248263,"The Brexit Shambles Stumbles On On 04.05.19 11:30 AM posted by Andrew Davies On Wednesday, the House of Commons finally reached a majority on a Brexit issue, but only by one vote. This wasnt a government proposal; it was a parliamentary rebellion to prevent a no deal exit and to require an extension to the planned leave date. The Conservative leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, later wrote, If these people had guns, we would be describing it as a military coup. The private member’s bill was introduced by former Labour minister Yvette Cooper and Conservative former minister Sir Oliver Letwin, and was rushed through at warp speed. While laws normally take weeks, even months, to pass, this one took just six hours. A brave minority in the House of Lords then succeeded in delaying its next stage, but it is still likely to get royal assent early next week. This was a panic move designed to prevent Britain falling off a cliff edge, facing the abyss, or crashing out, as leaving on World Trade Organization terms is pejoratively referred to. Yet this outcome only exists because Parliament planned it that way in its EU Withdrawal Bill passed in 2017. So, these MPs were legislating to save the nation from one of their own decisions. The threat of leaving without a deal was intended as a bargaining chip to get the best terms from the EUno deal is better than a bad deal. But the people who were most scared by it turned out to be British MPs and hence their rush to block it, not that their new bill means much as the EU can override U.K. law. Indeed, as we reach the Brexit end game, there has been a complete role reversal with the EU now using the no deal exit date to threaten the U.K. Parliament into accepting Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal. If a no-deal exit does happen, it will be by accident, as neither side wants italthough they may not be able to avoid it if they cannot arrange an alternative in time. A group called the English Democrats claims that Britain has in fact already left the EU, as it says there was no legal basis in U.K. law for changing the original March 29 default exit date. It has taken it to the High Court and is waiting for the case to be heard. Imagine the shock and utter chaos if it wins? Unlikely, but in order to change the April 12 leave date, MPs rushed to change the law, and this didnt happen before the original March 29 date was moved. Instead, it was decided in Brussels by May and the EU.**** The prime minister has likely never read U.S. President Donald Trumps The Art of the Deal, for she is not a negotiator, but an administrator who seeks an orderly exit above all else. So orderly that it doesnt appear to be much of an exit to most leavers. But that may have been Remainer Mays intention all along. The prime minister is now looking to Labour support to get her expensive withdrawal agreement passed on a fourth attempt, but faces mass resignations if she concedes too much to extreme left-wing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. And, even then, can her deal pass? Although the margin of defeat has reduced in each previous vote, from 230 to 149 to 58, it is still a very large gap to close. The clamour now from many MPs is for a confirmatory vote, or a second referendum, as it used to be called. While EU Council President Donald Tusk is touting a flexible extension of a years delay to Brexit, or until a deal is passed. The referendum was supposed to take sovereignty back from unelected bureaucrats in Brussels and return it to Parliament. Not an unreasonable request, and just imagine the reaction in the U.S. if NAFTA had been set up with law-making supremacy over Capitol Hill? Yet, ever since the Brexit decision was declared nearly three years ago, most of this current crop of legislators have not wanted to take on that extra burden of responsibility. The U.K. is facing a bizarre situation where the public votes to bring back powers to Parliament and its elected officials then vote to try to stop it from happening."

Trump was briefed by officials from the U.S. Border Patrol in the Calexico, California, station near the border with Mexico. We expect to have close to 400 miles [of wall] done within two years from now. That’s a lot, Trump said. We love California. But those people wanted us to build a wall, and we got it built, including wall in San Diego, which is pretty much completed. It’s had a tremendous impact. The wall has had a tremendous impact. Trump said the country is full and insisted the immigration asylum laws must be changed. We have a system that is full. Its just full. There’s nothing we can do about it, the president said.  … The system is full. When its full, there’s nothing you can do. You have to say, Im sorry. We can’t take you. California Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized Trumps call for changing the laws on asylum. Since our founding, this country has been a place of refugea safe haven for people fleeing tyranny, oppression, and violence, Newsom said in a statement . His words show a total disregard of the Constitution, our justice system, and what it means to be an American. Trump said the governor is out of touch with the security situation at the border. Gov. Newsom is honestly living in a different world, and thats a very dangerous world hes living in, and if he keeps living there, its lots of problems for the people of California. They dont want that, Trump said in response to a reporters question. They want to be secure. They want to be safe, and not only asylum, but many other things. … When you have an asylum situation where rough, tough people with criminal records are asking for asylum, it doesnt work that way. Trump declared a national emergency after Congress failed to provide full funding for the border wall. California is among 20 states suing to block the emergency declaration. While later speaking in front of the wall, the president described it as an anti-climb wall. The newly constructed wall is see-through, and some portions are 30 feet tall. U.S. Customs and Border Protection engaged in more than 100,000 border enforcement actions in March, the most actions in a single month in more than a decade, according to a White House statement. That represented a 516% increase from enforcement actions in March 2017. Of the actions in March, 64% involved unaccompanied illegal immigrant children and family units. In February, 75,000 migrants were apprehended or deemed inadmissible at the border. Trump said he doesnt want to shut down the border, but said it only would take a day to do so. Were going to shut it down if we have to, he said."

Thats why its vital for Americans to understand how tech giants can manipulate information, either intentionally or unwittingly, to advance a political agenda. Now, 34 conservative leaders are banding together to call for tech giants Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, and Google to cut ties with the Southern Poverty Law Center. The letter states in part, It is now clear that the SPLC has proven to be a hate-filled, anti-Christian, anti-conservative organization and nothing more than a weapon of the radical Left, whose goal is to bully people into compliance with their ideology. As weve discussed on previous episodes of “Media Misses,” the SPLC is a far-left civil rights organization that has made wild claims about conservative organizations over the years, lumping them in with hate groups like neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan. It has come under scrutiny after its founder, Morris Dees, resigned over accusations of discrimination and improper behavior. The issue has garnered the attention of those in Congress as well. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton has called on the IRS to look at the SPLCs tax exempt status. He wrote in a letter to the agency: Recent news reports have confirmed the long-established fact that the SPLC regularly engaged in defamation of its political opponents. In fact, the SPLCs defining characteristic is to fundraise off of defamation. The question also turns to media outlets as well. Will they stop using this organization as an authoritative source? Perhaps a turnaround is coming. The New Yorker , for instance, recently ran a piece called The Reckoning of Morris Dees and the Southern Poverty Law Center, and acknowledged that the SPLC has shifted its focus from shedding light on actual, serious extremist groups to exaggerations for the purpose of money making. And perhaps the media should be more skeptical of other similar groups and flawed studies about rising hate crime that simply fit a narrative they want to push. As Robby Soave wrote in Reason: When it comes to misleading hate crime data, the SPLC is far from the only offender. Many in the media have exaggerated a finding by the Anti-Defamation League that anti-Semitic hate has increased 57 percent under Trump. (Bomb threats made by an Israeli teenager were largely responsible for the perceived increase: anti-Semitic assaults actually decreased substantially.) The FBI’s hate crime data has also been widely mischaracterized . Hopefully, tech giants and media outlets learn a lesson from the SPLC mess and stop using it to malign Americans as a whole."

I Was a 3-Star General. Here’s Why Efforts to Weaken Officers’ Court-Martial Authorit,www.szone.us,@Heritage,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://www.szone.us/showthread.php?p=248249,"I Was a 3-Star General. Heres Why Efforts to Weaken Officers Court-Martial Authorit On 04.04.19 08:26 AM posted by Thomas Spoehr I had the privilege of serving in the United States Army for 36 years, retiring in 2016 as a lieutenant general (a three-star). I was a commanding officer three times for a total of six years. Like all commanding officers, I was responsible for training and equipping soldiers, and was required to enforce good order and discipline of those troops. Good order and discipline are essential to accomplishing the missionthe defense of the nation. As debate continues over how to handle sexual assaults in the military, and what role a commanding officer should play, I thought it would be helpful to share why commanding officers, such as I was, are critical to solving this problem. Today, commanders have the authority to refer soldiers under their command to a court-martial if they believe there is probable cause that they committed a crime. But some, led by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and a group named Protect Our Defenders, are now seeking to strip commanding officers of that authority. Instead, they want that authority to be held by a military JAG who, in their judgment, would make a better decision. This is terribly misguided. Removing accountability from us, and giving that authority to a so-called independent prosecutor, would only serve to weaken the military, its criminal justice system, and, ironically, result in fewer cases going to a court-marital. I was trained as a warfighter, not a lawyer. But as I rose in rank, I relied on the sound judgment of Army JAGs who advised me on a wide variety of legal issuesthe law of war, rules of engagement, contract law, personnel law, acquisition law, administrative law, and criminal law. Their advice was invaluable, and provided me with information that, combined with other information and experience, helped me lead to the best of my ability. During combat, commanders have the benefit of getting advice from a host of experts, including experts in intelligence, weather, ordnance, logistics, linguistics, law, and more. Our military is the best-trained military in the world. Our leaders are highly intelligent, adept, and agile, and are required to operate on and off the battlefield in a complex and ever-changing environment. Todays successful military leaders make thousands of critical decisions each month, from the unseen to the widely known. We try to get it right all the timethough sometimes we fail, because we are human. But we exist in an ecosystem where accountability is part of our DNA, because the defense of the nation is at stake. The American people deserve no less. The pinnacle of a military officers career is when he or she assumes command. As Richard Swain and Albert Pierce write in their seminal work on military leadership,  The Armed Forces Officer : Command is the acme of military leadership, the goal toward which officers most often aspire, and the route to the highest positions of trust in the profession of arms. Command is the authority that a commander in the armed forces lawfully exercises over subordinates by virtue of rank or assignment. Commanders at every echelon have a unique responsibility to make sense of the situation in which they find their forces and take all necessary actions to achieve their superiors assigned or implicit ends. Commanders are uniquely empowered to enforce their orders and those issued under their authority. They retain comprehensive responsibility for the conduct, efficiency, effectiveness, and health and welfare of all the forces entrusted to them. Though seldom mentioned explicitly today, commanders are still expected, as the 1923 Army Field Service Regulation required, ‘never [to] hesitate to exact whatever effort is necessary to attain the desired end.’ (Chapter 6, p. 78) Just as the role of the commanding officer in the military is unique, the military justice system is also unique, and for good reason . It is structured in order to help the military succeed in defending the nation. Its unique structure allows commanding officers, who have court-martial authority (called convening authority), to carry out the orders of their civilian leaders to fight and win wars. >>> Read The Heritage Foundations special report on sexual assault in the military Most commanding officers dont have convening authority. But some do, including the ability to send cases to a special court-martial (misdemeanors) or a general court-martial (felonies). I was a convening authority. When personnel under my command committed serious misconduct and there was probable cause to believe they had committed a crime, I had the responsibility and legal authority to send suspected criminals to a court-martial. Just as the role of the commanding officer in the military is unique, the military justice system is also unique, and for good reason. I referred those cases to a court-martial after consulting my staff JAG and the JAG prosecutor. And once that case was sent to a court-martial, the JAG prosecutor essentially owned the case. Efforts by some to strip commanding officers of this ability to refer cases to a court-martial are, from my perspective, dangerous and wrongheaded. Here are four reasons why. 1. It would weaken the military overall by stripping commanding officers of the ability to enforce good order and discipline for personnel under their command. A commanding officer in the military has a wide range of tools available to enforce good order and discipline. These tools include mild administrative remedies, such as informal counseling, formal counseling, executive officer inquiry, and non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. These administrative tools allow for flexible, quick, and effective discipline to address misbehavior or lack of attention to detail by those who violate rules. They help the commander show the troops that there are consequences, immediate and swift, for poor decisions or performance and minor misdeeds. The ultimate administrative remedy is the ability to fire a service member for misconduct. The power to send a soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine to an Administrative Discharge Board (referred to as an Admin Board in the military) sends a clear message to all those who serve under the commanding officer: There will be consequences for misconduct or neglect of duty. The ultimate remedy for any commanding officer is the power to refer a suspected criminal in their unit to a court-martial. Taking that power away from commanding officers eliminates an indispensable authority that cannot be delegated or transferred to anotherat least not if we are to demand accountability from commanders for prosecuting and preventing sexual assaults and other serious crimes. 2. Removing this power from commanding officers would weaken the militarys unique criminal justice system. Unlike the civilian criminal justice system , where prosecutors or police file charges against an accused in a standing court, the military justice system has no standing courts and must create one for each individual case. Courts-martial are created by the power vested in a convening authority. The convening authority creates a court-martial by issuing a convening order. Strip commanders of the ability to refer cases to a court-martial, and you send a loud and clear message to troops under her command that she does not really command them, in the full sense of the word. The convening authority has a role that cannot be reduced to either a prosecutor nor judge. This authority assigns military personnel to be members of a court-martial, decides on the charges to be filed, decides whether to use non-judicial punishment or an administrative proceeding in lieu of a trial, approves or rejects requests for expert witnesses, and accepts plea agreements. In contrast, civilian prosecutors decide only whom to investigate, whom to charge, and what to charge. The reason for the difference is that civilian prosecutors are not responsible for the defendants training, good order, and discipline in the way that a military commander is. Strip commanders of the ability to refer cases to a court-martial, and you send a loud and clear message to troops under her command that she does not really command them, in the full sense of the word. 3. If commanders are stripped of convening authority, fewer cases would go to a court-martial, including sexual assault cases. As a non-lawyer and convening authority, I was not bound by the ethics rules that all lawyers are required to follow. When I believed that there was probable cause that one of my subordinates committed a crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, I could refer that soldier to a court-martial. And I did several times in my career. Why? To hold them accountable for their suspected criminal misconduct. If commanders are stripped of convening authority, fewer cases would go to a court-martial, including sexual assault cases. Whether the prosecutor proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt was beside the point. I had a duty to enforce good order and discipline. Sending a soldier to a court-martial when he was suspected of a crime sent a loud and clear message to my troops that I was in command, and that I would not tolerate misconduct in my ranks. The charges against a soldier were brought, almost exclusively, by military prosecutors. But I, and I alone, was responsible for making the decision of sending that soldier to a court-martial and enforcing good order and discipline. 4. The number of sexual assault cases getting prosecuted would go down, not up. If Gillibrands proposal became law, then military prosecutors alone would decide whether or not to prosecute personnel under my command. And because military JAG prosecutors are lawyers, they must abide by the ethics rules under their state bar and the special ethics rules applicable to federal prosecutors. They cannot prosecute cases, like I could, where there is mere probable cause (the lowest standard of proof in the law) to believe that a soldier committed a criminal offense. Prosecutors, military or civilian, can only charge people with a crime if they have a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits. The American Bar Associations rule regarding the standards for prosecutors ( Standard 3-4.3 ) states that a prosecutor cannot file charges unless the prosecutor believes the charges are supported by probable cause (the only standard for commanders), and that the evidence will be sufficient to support a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the decision to charge is in the interests of justice. There are, undoubtedly, thousands of cases that can be brought under a probable cause standard, but cannot be pursued under a reasonable doubt standard. Sexual assault cases are difficult enough to investigate and prove in court. If commanders are stripped of their authority to send sexual assault cases to court-martial under a probable cause standard, then far fewer cases can, or will, be sent by lawyers, who must abide by the much higher standard. Sexual assault is a cancer that destroys military units and individuals. It is intolerable in the military. Every commander has the responsibility to create an atmosphere of trust and respect in their unit, and to hold those accountable to meet that standard. Placing that responsibility in the hands of lawyers, while appearing to be an easy solution, would directly weaken the ability of military commanders to rid their units of sexual assault."

FBI Investigates Fires At Historically Black Churches In Louisiana,www.newsy.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsy.com/stories/fbi-investigates-fires-at-black-churches-in-louisiana/,"April 7, 2019 April 7, 2019 Three black churches burned in the same Louisiana parish over a span of just 10 days. Now the FBI is getting involved. SHOW TRANSCRIPT
The FBI is looking into a string of fires at historically black churches in Louisiana.
Three churches in the same parish have burned since March 26. Most recently, Mount Pleasant Baptist Church caught fire Thursday morning.
The fire marshal said the incidents can't be ruled hate crimes yet, but the churches are being treated as crime scenes. Investigators have identified ""suspicious elements"" at each location. The fire marshal's office said on social media Thursday that the FBI is now involved.
An expert told The Lafayette Daily Advertiser that churches are a common target for arsonists because they're often unoccupied. In the '90s, then-President Bill Clinton commissioned a Department of Justice report on church arson. It found that while some church fires are linked to hate groups, a majority are not.
But, the fact that all three churches are predominantly black raises concern. White supremacists have historically burned black churches to spread fear and, in the 1960s, because they were central to the civil rights movement."

The network seemed to have no problem letting their cameras linger, while the announcers filled time and waited for the coach to arrive. However, moments after the coach Chris Beard arrived, the team began to pray and the cameras cut away to a shot of the announcers.

Twitter was quick to take notice, and react:
CBS literally cuts away from Texas Tech locker room minute team starts a prayer after winning in the #FinalFour , and then cut back as soon as they were done. I’m sure that was a coincidence.

CBS has yet to offer an explanation as to why they chose to cut away during Texas Tech’s team prayer.
This is not the first time a network has decided to cut away during a moment of prayer, or religious speech at a sporting event. In October of 2015, ESPN cut away from Clemson coach Dabo Swinney after he thanked “the good Lord” during a post game interview.
Texas Tech will play Virginia for the national championship on Monday night.

MITCH’S LONG GAME TO BURN DOWN THE SENATE…,havecoffeewillwrite.com,Jeff Hess,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://havecoffeewillwrite.com/?p=67981,"MITCH’S LONG GAME TO BURN DOWN THE SENATE… April 7th, 2019
I know good people who live in Kentucky. I once asked one of them, my friend and poet Sherry Chandler—buy her latest: Talking Burly —how it was that the people of Kentucky kept reëlecting Mitch McConnell to the United States Senate and she could only shake her head in disbelief and wonder. The people of Kentucky and West Virginia have a great deal in common.
West Virginians first elected Robert Carlyle Byrd to the Senate in 1958 and he served in that house for 51 years. They kept reëlecting him because he brought home the bacon to one of our nation’s poorest states. Kentuckians first elected Addison Mitchell McConnell Jr. to the Senate in 1984. I’m not sure what McConnell was bring home. Both men rose to become leaders in the Senate but their legacies will be very different.
For all his faults, Byrd is remembered most for his reverence of the Senate. McConnell will be remembered as the man who burned down the house. Robert Reich, writing in Mitch McConnell is destroying the Senate–and American government for The Guardian , explains:
No person has done more in living memory to undermine the functioning of the US government than the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.
Yes, Donald Trump has debased and defiled the presidency. He has launched blistering attacks on Democrats, on judges he disagrees with, journalists who criticize him and the intelligence community.
But McConnell is actively and willfully destroying the Senate.
So, what has McConnell done that was so horrible? Reich recites the litany:
Last Wednesday he used his Republican majority to cut the time for debating Trump’s court appointees from 30 hours to two–thereby enabling Republicans to ram through even more Trump judges.
McConnell doesn’t give a fig about the Senate, or about democracy. He cares only about winning. On the eve of the 2010 midterm elections he famously declared that his top priority was for Barack Obama “to be a one-term president”.
Between 2009 and 2013, McConnell’s Senate Republicans blocked 79 Obama nominees. In the entire history of the United States until that point, only 68 presidential nominees had been blocked.
This unprecedented use of the filibuster finally led Senate Democrats in 2013 to change the rules on some presidential nominees (but not the supreme court), to require simple majorities.
In response, McConnell fumed that “breaking the rules to change the rules is un-American”. If so, McConnell is about as un-American as they come. Once back in control of the Senate he buried Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland for the supreme court by refusing even to hold hearings.
Then, in 2017, McConnell and his Republicans changed the rules again, ending the use of the filibuster even for supreme court nominees and clearing the way for Senate confirmation of Trump’s Neil Gorsuch.
Step by step, McConnell has sacrificed the Senate as an institution to partisan political victories.
For years Senate Republicans have played a long game using their most powerful mandate as defined in Article II, Section 2, paragraph 2 of the United States Constitution:
[The President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.
For the average American, that power has been best understood through the mind of Allen Drury as revealed in his 1959 novel (and the 1962 movie ) Advise and Consent. Neither Drury nor Byrd would recognize McConnell’s senate. Reich continues:
There is a vast difference between winning at politics by playing according to the norms of our democracy, and winning by subverting those norms.
To Abraham Lincoln, democracy was a covenant linking past and future. Political institutions, in his view, were “the legacy bequeathed to us”.
On the eve of the Senate’s final vote on repealing the Affordable Care Act in July 2017, the late John McCain returned to Washington from his home in Arizona, where he was being treated for brain cancer, to cast the deciding vote against repeal.
Knowing he would be criticized by other Republicans, McCain noted that over his career he had known senators who seriously disagreed with each other but nonetheless knew “they had an obligation to work collaboratively to ensure the Senate discharged its constitutional responsibilities effectively”.
In words that have even greater relevance today, McCain added that “it is our responsibility to preserve that, even when it requires us to do something less satisfying than ‘winning’.”
Knowing he would be criticized is putting the case mildly .
For me, this paragraph best describes what McConnell is doing and why what he is doing has profound consequences.
In any social or political system it’s always possible to extract benefits by being among the first to break widely accepted norms. In a small town where people don’t lock their doors or windows, the first thief can effortlessly get into anyone’s house. But once broken, the system is never the same. Everyone has to buy locks. Trust deteriorates.
When the people no longer trust, whether that trust was in their elected officials or in their police forces, the system suffers, breaks down and chaos triumphs.
That is the long game that McConnell and his ilk are playing.
They must be stopped or we will live in a nation that our founders would not recognize."

Han: The Way for Huawei,thepolitic.org,Kevin Han,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://thepolitic.org/han-the-way-for-huawei/,"Kevin Han April 7, 2019
Cellphone users love to complain about problems with their providers. The American giants of T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, and AT&T are often criticized for “awful service,” or being “too expensive.” Across the world, other foreign contemporaries like Ericsson, Nokia, and Huawei beget similar complaints. However, with Huawei, a Chinese mobile network company that is probably little known to the everyday American, complaints about fluctuating coverage and slow LTE may soon become concerns over foreign espionage and cyber warfare.
Huawei, a fast-rising leader for the next generation of 5G mobile networks whose sales rose by 20 percent to exceed $107 billion in the past year, has been accused of enabling potential cyber-espionage by the Chinese government and military. The accusations point to recent Chinese laws (which state that Chinese firms must, if directed, assist in intelligence collection) as evidence that Huawei is untrustworthy and could act as a conduit for Chinese espionage. The accusations are further supported by a recent British assessment of Huawei that stated that aspects of Huawei’s software is filled with various potential “back doors” like duplicate code, which can weaken a device’s cryptography and leave data vulnerable. Additional allegations that Huawei has engaged in intellectual property theft also haven’t helped the telecommunications company’s reputation abroad. And while Huawei’s founder Ren Zhengfei has insisted that Huawei has never nor ever will “enable Chinese government espionage,” Huawei has indisputable ties with the Chinese government and is clearly not managed under the same judicial and legal safeguards that exist in the U.S. that limit companies’ cooperation with intelligence agencies.
For the U.S., the fact that Huawei’s 5G networks can be used for anything ranging from self-driving cars to military operations is especially worrying. This isn’t helped by Huawei’s burgeoning mobile telecommunications empire becoming more and more prevalent in other developing countries . This is partly due to Huawei’s aggressive price-slashing technique, which is doing significant damage to internal competitors and ensuring that in some countries, there is no choice but to use Huawei’s connected network. And while the U.S. recently banned federal agencies and contractors from purchasing Huawei equipment in an effort to curtail its rising influence, the problem lies with other foreign markets that are already using Huawei. Due to the need to connect with other foreign markets for services like the Internet, American traffic will inevitably traverse systems that Huawei controls, allowing for Huawei insight onto American data.
This dilemma has led to significant action by the U.S. and other nations to attempt to stop Huawei on the basis of its ripe potential for cyber-espionage. Providers in the U.S. have already begun to devise new methods to combat Huawei such as of new standards of encryption, forming segmented network components, and gateways that scrub for malware when international data passes through them. Furthermore, the U.S. is not alone in its ban on Huawei products. Other nations like the Australia have also followed suit. And the U.S. has utilized other legal tactics besides the bans. This is evident in the detainment of Huawei’s chief financial officer , Meng Wanzhou, by the Canadian government earlier this year on behalf of the U.S. government. Meng, who is currently under house arrest under charges that Huawei breached the U.S.-led export sanctions on Iran, is currently fighting extradition to the U.S. Under this intense pressure from the U.S. and the rest of the West, Huawei has instead moved towards telecommunications primacy in other markets and flourished, standing as the leader of telecommunications in the 4G markets of Africa, the Middle East, southern Europe, and southeast Asia .
Huawei has thus surprisingly thrived and continued its growth despite this opposition by the U.S. As mentioned before, it’s economic growth is indisputable and U.S. national security officials are already quietly preparing for a potential future where the 5G network market is cornered and thus dominated by the more affordable Huawei. This cornering of the market would shut out domestic companies all over the world and make Huawei one of the only viable telecommunication companies. In fact, the actions against Huawei have arguably given it even more free press around the world. In China , the perceived “bullying” of Huawei has even increased its sales there.
While experts state the mythical 5G networks are mere years away, a full rollout in developed nations is expected to take in around ten years. This gives the U.S. some time to prepare and potentially offset a Huawei takeover. However, Huawei continues towards dominance as it spreads towards other developing nations and raises its domestic profile. The company has even raised the prospect of filing a lawsuit against the U.S. government, claiming that the espionage claims are unsubstantiated and that the company has been denied due process. Nonetheless, as the 5G network becomes and closer and closer to reality, it seems that another conflict between the U.S. and China is set to occur, with the U.S. surely pushing for more bans and restrictions on Huawei. But Huawei, whose name roughly translates to “achievement”, seems to have lived up to its namesake, showing the world what it can achieve in the face of American adversity. Previous Article"

Nothing is off the table of the LGBT movement. Not the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman. Not the sanctity of normal child development. Marriage equality was not good enough for the LGBT movement. Today, the LGBT movement wants to indoctrinate kindergartners. American families are now supposed to stand idly by as the LGBT movement exacts its decadent Kinsey recruitment experiment on 5 year olds. While many children cannot read and write, the LGBT movement insist that our children learn 20 different gender pronouns. Gender pronouns that are simply made up gibberish and a manifestation of liberal idiocy.
As a member of the United States Air Force and Air Force Reserves and a C-141 Starlifter Flight Engineer, I performed copious missions involved with the hauling of Patriot remains. In the military, it is forbidden to exploit for personal or political gain those that gave their final measure for our freedoms. Our mission was to transport these gallant Americans to Dover AFB, and pay extreme respect to their selfless acts. Out of respect to these dedicated Americans, we refrained from taking pictures or bragging about the transporting of flag draped gaskets. MAC aircrews would maintain a posture of extreme respect until the the fallen patriot left the flight-line.
The sanctity of the Dover AFB ceremony for the fallen soldier is now being exploited by the LGBT movement for political gain. I have had enough of this type of crap. How dare you exploit the fallen to justify transgender soldiers. Our gallant boys and girls that gave their lives for the rest of us do not deserve to be cheap props for the LGBT movement.
Below is a trans-gendered person on CBS using our flag draped fallen to further the LGBT movement. The Sanctity of marriage was not good enough. The sanctity of natural child development could not be left alone. Now they are insulting our fallen soldiers for political gain. "

John Longan was an agent with the US Border Patrol in the 1940s and ’50s, working near the Mexican border, where two Guatemalan migrant children fell mortally ill in the custody of border agents last month: 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquín, who died on December 8, and 8-year-old Felipe Gómez Alonzo, who died on Christmas Eve. 1 Ad Policy
Longan had a reputation for violence, as did many of his fellow patrollers. Since its founding in the early 1900s, the Border Patrol has operated with near impunity, becoming arguably the most politicized branch of federal law enforcement—even more so than J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI. 2
As the Cold War heated up in Latin America following the 1959 Cuban Revolution, Longan, who’d started his career as a police officer in Oklahoma, moved on to work for the CIA, providing security assistance—under the cover of the State Department—to allied anticommunist nations. Put simply, Longan taught local intelligence and police agencies how to create death squads to target political activists, deploying tactics that he’d used earlier to capture migrants on the border. He arrived in Guatemala in late 1965 and put into place a paramilitary unit that, early the next year, would execute what he called Operación Limpieza, or Operation Cleanup. Within three months, this unit conducted over 80 raids and multiple assassinations, including an action that, over the course of four days, led to the capture, torture, and execution of more than 30 prominent left-wing opposition leaders. The military dumped their bodies into the sea, while the government denied any knowledge of their whereabouts. 3
Longan’s Operación Limpieza was a decisive step in the unraveling of Guatemala, empowering an intelligence system that over the course of the country’s civil war would be responsible for tens of thousands of disappearances, 200,000 deaths, and countless tortures. (Greg Grandin describes Longan’s work in his book The Last Colonial Massacre .) 4 Related Article After the Caravan Annette Lin
Of course, the US role in that civil war wasn’t limited to the covert operations of one former Border Patrol agent. Throughout the Cold War, Washington intervened multiple times in Guatemala, funded a rampaging army, ran cover for the death squads that its own security agents—like Longan—helped create, and signaled that it would turn a blind eye to genocide. Even before Ronald Reagan’s 1980 election, two retired generals with prominent roles in his campaign traveled to Central America and told Guatemalan officials that “Mr. Reagan recognizes that a good deal of dirty work has to be done” (for this quote, see Allan Nairn’s report “Controversial Reagan Campaign Links With Guatemalan Government and Private Sector Leaders,” published by the Council on Hemispheric Affairs on October 30, 1980). Once in office, Reagan supplied munitions and training to the Guatemalan Army to carry out that dirty work (despite a ban on military aid imposed during the Carter administration, since existing contracts were exempt from that ban). Reagan was steadfast in his moral backing for Guatemala’s génocidaires , calling de facto head of state Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt, who seized power in a coup in the spring of 1982, “a man of great personal integrity” and “totally dedicated to democracy.” 5
T he civil war that the United States drove forward in Guatemala hit the home regions of Jakelin Caal Maquín and Felipe Gómez Alonzo—the two children who died recently in US custody—hard. 6
Jakelin was Q’eqchi’-Maya, from the town of Raxruhá in northern Alta Verapaz. There, as in much of rural Guatemala, Maya communities have struggled for more than a century to remain on their lands. For much of that time, the US government intervened on the wrong side of those struggles. The result was a vortex of violent displacement that continues to this day. 7 Current Issue View our current issue
At the beginning of the 1900s, the Q’eqchi’-Maya lived mostly in Guatemala’s lush, fertile northern highlands. But during the 20th century, many were pushed out. First, coffee planters, who were members of Guatemala’s colonial and military elite, as well as new European and North American investors, dispossessed them of their lands through legal chicanery and violence. When Q’eqchi’ villagers tried to fight back, they were killed or exiled. 8
The CIA-orchestrated 1954 coup against a democratically elected president, Jacobo Arbenz, was a turning point in the Q’eqchi’ region. An ambitious land-reform program that had widespread beneficial effects in Alta Verapaz was reversed, and poor Q’eqchi’s began a great migration—fleeing political repression and hunger—to the lowlands, either east toward the Caribbean or north into the Petén rain forest. Raxruhá, Jakelin’s home town, was founded in the 1970s by these internal migrants. 9
Caal and Maquín are common surnames among the Q’eqchi’, with strong historical resonance. Adelina Caal Maquín, also known as Mama Maquín, is an icon of political struggle in Guatemala. Like Jakelin, Adelina was a refugee, having fled her mountain village after the 1954 coup for the lowland town of Panzós, where she became a leader in the fight against land evictions. On May 29, 1978, she was murdered, along with scores of other protesters, by the army. The Panzós massacre kicked off a brutal period of violence: Over the next few years, the US-backed Guatemalan military murdered more than 160,000 Maya. The army especially targeted Q’eqchi’ communities for slaughter, then rounded up the survivors in military-controlled model villages. A women’s-refugee organization honored Mama Maquín by adopting her name. 10
The end of Guatemala’s civil war in the 1990s brought no peace to the Q’eqchi’. The policies pushed by Washington created new afflictions: The promotion of mining, hydroelectric production, hardwood timbering, and African-palm plantations for “clean” biofuels destroyed their subsistence economy and poisoned their water and corn land. 11
Meanwhile, Q’eqchi’ communities were caught in the crosshairs of an escalating international drug war. As Washington spent billions of dollars shutting down South American trafficking routes, Q’eqchi’ communities were turned into a transshipment corridor for cocaine moving into the United States. Throughout the 2010s, drug-related crime and violence that had previously been concentrated in Colombia engulfed Central America, including Jakelin’s birthplace, accelerating the migration north. In 2010, narcotics-related violence grew so bad, with the Mexican Zetas cartel effectively controlling large parts of Alta Verapaz, that the Guatemalan government placed the department under an extended state of siege. 12
Q’eqchi’ men and women fought back, organizing social movements to defend their communities. But the repression continued. In 2011, soldiers working with private paramilitary forces evicted hundreds of Q’eqchi’ families, turning their land over to agribusinesses financed by international development loans. One study estimates that between 2003 and 2012, 11 percent of Q’eqchi’ families lost their land to sugar and African-palm plantations. By 2018, the situation had grown even more dire, with a wave of murders of Q’eqchi’ peasant activists. 13
And so more and more Q’eqchi’ refugees have been forced to leave the communities founded by their parents and grandparents, taking their chances on migrating to the United States. Why would a father bring his young daughter on such a perilous trek? CNN Español interviewed Jakelin’s relatives in Guatemala, who said that her father, Nery Gilberto Caal, 29, did everything he could to “stay in his land, but necessity made him try to get to the US.” According to the World Bank, the Q’eqchi’ are among the poorest of the poor in Guatemala and suffer from chronic malnutrition. 14
The past two decades have brought changes in US border policy, with terrible consequences for Central Americans. The militarization of the border since the 1990s, especially the sealing off of urban entry points, has pushed migrants to cross in remote and treacherous desert areas, where thousands have died. Border militarization also helps explain why people would bring their children on such a dangerous journey. In the past, men usually migrated alone; they would work for a while in the United States and then return to visit their families. But now, border militarization has ratcheted up the cost of that trip. Where it used to cost around $1,000 to travel from Central America to the United States, it now costs up to $12,000, making shuttle migration impossible for many. Often the only way for families to stay together is for women and children to migrate as well. Yes, it’s dangerous, but so is staying in Guatemala. 15
Intending to request political asylum, Jakelin and her father were among a group of 163 Guatemalans who turned themselves in to the Border Patrol at a remote entry point in the New Mexico desert on the night of December 6. This is legal: US law says that people may make an affirmative claim of asylum no matter how or where they enter the country. 16
F elipe Gómez Alonzo, the other guatemalan child who died in Border Patrol detention, was born in a different region of the country than Jakelin. But the history of his community is also one of land struggles and violent displacement, where Guatemala’s peace accords brought little respite. 17
Felipe was from the western highlands, in the department of Huehuetenango, in an isolated village called Yalambojoch, a 10-hour drive from Guatemala City and not far from the Mexican border. The village sits in a sunken valley surrounded by pine-tipped hills. In the middle of this valley is a knoll that looks like a baby in its mother’s womb. In Chuj, the Maya language of this region, this knoll is unin witz , the “child hill.” 18
Where Jakelin was Q’eqchi’, Felipe was Chuj, part of a community of former tenant farmers with a long history of fighting for their land. As in the Q’eqchi’ region, the US-orchestrated 1954 coup overturned agrarian reforms and kicked off decades of political strife in Huehuetenango, pitting local landowners allied with the military against impoverished Maya peasants desperate for land and a better future. Many communities in this region were influenced by the Catholic social-justice doctrines of liberation theology that swept through Central America in the 1960s and ’70s. When the Ejército Guerrillero de los Pobres (Guerrilla Army of the Poor) entered Huehuetenango in the mid-1970s, large numbers of villagers greeted them as allies in the struggle against the “army of the rich,” and by 1980 the province was in open rebellion against Guatemala’s corrupt and violent military government. 19
On June 17, 1982, Guatemalan soldiers under the command of Ríos Montt entered the San Francisco cattle estate immediately adjacent to Yalambojoch. The estate’s owner, a military colonel, had fled because of guerrilla activity in the area. Soldiers went from house to house rounding up workers and their families, whom they accused of supporting the guerrillas. They separated children from their parents and killed them by slashing their stomachs or smashing their heads against poles. Women were raped and then burned alive. The soldiers killed the men with bullets or by beheading. After a day of slaughter, 350 people were dead. A lone survivor made his way into Mexico, where Guatemalan anthropologist and Jesuit priest Ricardo Falla interviewed him. The San Francisco massacre was highlighted in Guatemala’s 1999 Truth Commission report. 20
After the massacre, Yalambojoch residents fled along with thousands of others, leaving the border corridor between Guatemala and Mexico almost completely depopulated, as government troops razed their villages. Whereas villagers in the Q’eqchi’ region were pushed by massacres into the rugged mountain and jungle terrain within Guatemala, people from Yalambojoch fled across the border into Mexico. Some were captured and killed by the army as they fled. Others ended up in refugee camps or dispersed throughout Mexico’s southern states. Still others continued on to the United States, beginning the great movement of Guatemalans to el Norte . All told, 1.5 million people were displaced by the Guatemalan military’s scorched-earth campaign in 1981 and ‘82. Guatemala’s Commission for Historical Clarification called the violent displacement in the Maya-Chuj region an “act of genocide.” Young Felipe Gómez Alonzo’s father, Agustín Gómez Pérez, was just a child of 11 during that exodus. Yalambojoch’s villagers stayed away for 14 years, returning only after the signing of the peace accords in 1996. 21
Huehuetenango had been one of Guatemala’s top migrant-sending regions. So why couldn’t these returnees survive in postwar Guatemala? One reason is the legacy of the genocide: The army’s broader purpose was not just to beat back the guerrillas but also to destroy any hope for a different future in Guatemala. Among the people from Yalambojoch who were scattered in Mexico after 1982, only half returned to Guatemala, and those who did were strangers to one another. Young adults who had fled as children didn’t know much about the land or how to farm it. When Mexican and US labor recruiters arrived in Huehuetenango to hire Maya youth for jobs in US agriculture and poultry plants—as Mexican workers unionized, the Guatemalan workers were seen as more pliable—these young people jumped at the chance to go. As Ricardo Falla and Elena Yojcom describe in El Sueño del Norte en Yalambojoch ( The Dream of the North in Yalambojoch ), remittances sent from the United States rebuilt these war-ravaged communities. With few exceptions, international migration was the only reparation these communities had, as Guatemalan anthropologist Ruth Piedrasanta shows. 22
Residents of Yalambojoch subsist on plots of only a few hectares of marginal land per family. The peace accords didn’t change the inequitable land-tenure structure or the concentration of political and economic power in the country. That chance had been lost with the 1954 coup and the counterinsurgency of the early 1980s, as time and time again the US government tipped the balance of power in favor of the Guatemalan ruling class. Elites in Guatemala are only too happy to see people emigrate, as the banks controlled by the oligarchy reap financial dividends from the transfer of remittances; and beginning in the 1990s, international development banks began to promote remittances as development. 23
Instead of pursuing a people-centered rural development, the Guatemalan government’s postwar strategy, backed by international development loans, has been to open up large swaths of the country to foreign investment in megaprojects like mining and hydroelectric dams. As Guatemalan economist Luis Solano notes, there is not a single Maya name among the list of investors in these projects, where the profits go to international conglomerates in association with elite family networks in Guatemala. 24
One such project is the Northern Transversal Highway, a project initiated by Guatemala’s military governments, in concert with foreign oil interests, to open up the northern reaches of the country to oil drilling and other forms of extraction. Guerrilla sabotage halted the project during the civil war, but since the peace accords were signed, it has returned with a vengeance. The Transversal now spans the entire region, from northern Huehuetenango, where Felipe Gómez Alonzo lived, to Alta Verapaz, where Jakelin Caal Maquín’s grave is located. Much of the foreign mining activity in Guatemala is concentrated near the Transversal. Both Alta Verapaz and Huehuetenango form part of what the government calls the “hydro-electric ring,” where water rights are granted to corporate interests. 25
In Yalambojoch, people banded together to stop construction of the highway through their village—not because they didn’t want a road, but because the Israeli company contracted to build it threatened to cut down hundreds of trees in a protected forest reserve next to the community’s only supply of fresh drinking water. Not too far away, community and environmental activists opposing the megaprojects have been jailed, attacked, or killed, and Guatemalan security forces have militarized the zone once again. The most recent killings in this region occurred two days before Felipe and his father crossed the US border. 26 Related Article A Brutal Expulsion in Guatemala Shows How Neoliberalism Gets Greenwashed Greg Grandin
Finally, there is climate change. While it is too simplistic to claim that Central American migrants are “climate refugees” (the assertion is dangerous, too, since it ultimately justifies even more apocalyptic border-enforcement policies), there is evidence that in some regions, climate change may be eroding people’s ability to stay on their lands. In Huehuetenango, including in Yalambojoch, the potential to earn cash by growing coffee on small plots is being undermined by the spread of a plant-choking fungus called la roya , or coffee-leaf rust, which some scientists attribute to climate change. 27
There are circles within circles in the tortured history of Guatemala, all spinning forward to this dismal moment. A Border Patrol agent began working with the CIA and helped put into place a death-squad regime that accelerated a civil war, which in turn produced biblical levels of displacement. When the refugees from that civil war, including families from Yalambojoch, tried to return home, many found that they couldn’t survive in the society the war had created (according to news reports, Felipe’s father was drowning in debt). Suffering yet more violence, more displacement, and more dispossession, and doing their best to fend off the worst social and environmental effects of resource extraction and grinding poverty, many tried to escape, with the only viable route being north, to the militarized border where, in a way, it all began. According to Stuart Schrader in his forthcoming book Badges Without Borders: How Global Counterinsurgency Transformed American Policing , it was common practice during the Cold War to send former Border Patrol agents to train foreign police through CIA-linked “public safety” programs. Men like Longan helped speed up the pace with which local security forces could target and kill political reformers, thus accelerating political polarization and social misery. 28
As the Drive-By Truckers wrote in a 2016 song—about a murderous teen who became a Border Patrol agent and who went on to lead the NRA into its current militant right-wing phase—“It all started with the border. And that’s still where it is today.” 29

Rep. Adam Schiff , D-Calif., blasted Republicans calling him to step down from his post as chair of the House Intelligence Committee for his repeated claims of collusion between President Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russian operatives.
Schiff on Sunday refused to back down from his claims that the evidence of wrongdoing by Trump “is in plain sight” and said he has no regrets calling out the president for what he believes is “deeply unethical and improper conduct.”
“I think there is a different standard here between the Republicans and the Democrats,” Schiff said during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “The Republicans seem to think that as long as you can't prove it's a crime, all is fair in love and war…I don't feel that way, I don't think most Americans feel that way.”
ADAM SCHIFF REJECTS REPORTS MUELLER INDICTMENTS ARE OVER, SAYS SPECIAL COUNSEL COULD BE CALLED TO TESTIFY
For two years, Schiff routinely sounded ominous warnings about what Special Counsel Robert Mueller might find on Trump.
In March 2017, Schiff told MSNBC that ""there is more than circumstantial evidence now"" of a relationship between Russia and Trump's associates. In December of that year, Schiff said on CNN: ""The Russians offered help, the campaign accepted help. The Russians gave help and the president made full use of that help. That is pretty damning, whether it is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of conspiracy or not.""
Video
And in May of last year, Schiff said on ABC that the Russian hacking of Democratic National Committee emails is ""like Watergate in the sense that you had a break in at the Democratic headquarters, in this case a virtual one, not a physical break in, and you had a president as part of a cover up."" Schiff said later that the Russia investigation is ""a size and scope probably beyond Watergate.""
Despite Schiff’s claims, Mueller found no evidence of coordination or conspiracy involving Trump, his campaign and the Russian government, Attorney General William Barr wrote in a letter released late last month.
Video
Now Trump’s Republican allies – from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy – are calling on Schiff to do everything from vacating his committee chairmanship to leaving office.
“He owes an apology to the American public,"" McCarthy said. “There is no place in Adam Schiff's world or in Congress that he should be chair of the intel committee.""
Video
McCarthy added: ""There is no way he could lead the intel committee and he should step back.""
Schiff remains steadfast in his claims that there is evidence of wrongdoing “in plain sight.”

“I don't regret calling out this president for what i consider deeply unethical and improper conduct and the moment we start to think that we should back away from exposing this kind of malfeasance and corruption is a dangerous point,” he said.
Schiff added: “There is a risk when you have an immoral president, a president who lacks in basic character who violates the norms of office. There is even a greater risk in doing too little oversight. I make no apologies for that and I’m going to continue holding this administration responsible.” "
"I Employ Dozens Of Wonderful Guatemalans, And I Want The Border Wall",thefederalist.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/04/employ-dozens-wonderful-guatemalans-want-border-wall/,"By Ben Williams April 4, 2019
“I’ve always felt that a person’s intelligence is directly reflected by the number of conflicting points of view he can entertain simultaneously on the same topic,” said Abigail Adams toward the end of the 18th century. This is how I feel about immigration policy.
Mrs. Adams’ quote came to mind in the last few days, as we planted trees on the farm. To be honest, the “we” doing the actual sticking in the ground was almost entirely a crew of younger men. My usefulness is more in carrying batches of trees out, picking up boxes, and performing whatever odd jobs a nearly worn-out old man can do.
“We” planted a lot of trees, too—right at 70,000 slash pine seedlings. While 70,000 may sound like a lot trees, and it is to us, in the larger scheme of the overall forestry industry, it’s not really that many. The vast majority of our trees went into the same ground where a similar planting effort two years ago failed due to drought. Beyond the expense of planting more than 100 acres a second time, we’ve also lost two years of growth on something that takes 14 years at minimum before it’s ready for any sort of harvest.
Planting by hand is more expensive and difficult than planting by machine, but when done by a skilled crew, it’s more cost-effective than the alternatives. The crews plant further to the edges of the fields and can adjust where they stick the tree, so they end up avoiding old stumps and other things that a machine would just plant a tree on top of.
Of course, Mrs. Adams’s words have nothing to do with how trees get planted. They bear directly on my seemingly conflicting views on immigration, since I employ a crew of young men, mostly immigrants, to plant these trees. Many Years of Interactions with New Americans
Having previously spent 35 years in the seafood business here in Florida, my view of immigrants has come to be positive to a great degree,because of many thousands of interactions across the fish case. These more often than not involved me in my rubber boots and apron waiting on a customer, helping him select a fish, then cleaning it for him.
On more than a few occasions, the customer could not speak English, nor could I speak Chinese or Farsi or but the smallest amount of Spanish, so their instructions for how I was to clean the fish were communicated by hand. This wasn’t too hard when they simply wanted the fish to be scaled and gutted, with head removed. It was a bit more difficult when they desired trimming the fins, removing the gills, and sectioning the fish into chunks. And it got really complicated if they wanted the bones removed while keeping the fish basically intact.
It’s posited as one of the great values of capitalism that when we engage in voluntary interactions—when we trade value for value—and when we truly understand what is in our own self-interest, that we will find politely and honestly treating others garners the same in return. This has been true for me, at least from across the fish case.
The other end of the seafood business, the sourcing of product for the market, also generated positive interactions with immigrants. Miami is a major import point for all manner of seafood from South and Central America. Only the dullest of minds could not realize how valuable immigrants are to facilitating that trade. Whether due to familial connections or an understanding of how things worked in a particular place, or simply the ability to seamlessly surmount language barriers, immigrants have made much of that trade work. Our customers in the market, whether immigrant or native-born, benefited from this also, as it enhanced the quality and variety available to them.
If you wait on a customer for decades, and if you source from a supplier for similar lengths of time, you will inevitably end up talking to one another. Invariably, the time will come when you and the supplier or customer go past the simple pleasantries of “Yes, ma’am” and “What have you got today?” to actually asking a question of substance. It’s those small extra learnings about each other that help tie us together as human and that let us more easily accept differences. These interactions create individuals from groups rather than groups from individuals, the latter being something the political professionals seek to do, so they can more easily herd us.
So, too, has been the general experience of working with a number of crews from Central America over the last few years here at the farm. Some of the men are able to speak English (the crew leaders in particular), and as in the fish market, we end up eventually getting to the learning questions—the ones that bind us as humans. The Stories of Immigrants from Guatemala
The tree crew and its leader were from Guatemala this time. As we hauled trees to the guys doing the planting, the crew leader taking time to assess planting density and give general directions, we had time to talk.
I discovered he is almost 38, has been coming to the United States for the planting season for 20 years, and likes his job. For all those years, he’s worked for the same company—something that points back to that trading value for value idea.
Back home, he farms coffee on his own land. Knowing nothing of coffee farming, I asked questions to learn. Turns out that farming coffee is as hard as planting trees, though in different ways. He also offered that some, if not all of, the other men also farmed coffee, most on their own land.
We also discussed that his wife was working their coffee farm while he was here, and that it was a busy time back home. The common thread—my wife and I having worked the fish market together, and now working the tree farm, in unison with what him and his wife are doing—was hard to miss.
Now, when you think all that through rationally, you realize this man has made a decision not all that different from one a friend’s daughter and son-in-law have made. The son-in-law takes off and works wherever his company sends him, for up to six weeks at a time, while his wife works her job here. It’s exactly the same setup, borders between nations rather than states being the big difference.
In each instance, the effort, the industry, the pulling in tandem, the familial attachments, and the personal sacrifices in service of a better life are exactly the same. In both instances, I think admiration is due. More Complex than ‘Open Borders’ vs. ‘Build the Wall’
I know, so far I sound unconflicted. You’d even possibly assume me to be an open borders advocate. To be honest, I would lobby hard for more immigration, tilted towards our neighbors to the south. But there is more to it, much more, some of it seemingly at odds with my initial exploration of the issue. It is the antithesis of embracing immigrants to embrace the lawbreaker ahead of the legal.
You see, I agree with building “the wall” provided it’s coupled with a thorough vetting of those arriving with claims of asylum, and a generally robust and prompt response to illegal crossings. I’d even entertain the idea of ending “birthright citizenship” as it currently exists and imposing some requirement for a level of proficiency in English to be attained before citizenship is granted.
Now, all of a sudden, after those last couple of sentences, you’re thinking I’m anti-immigrant. You’d be wrong, just as wrong as your initial assumption that I’m an open borders advocate.
The apparent disconnect comes down to the value of the rule of law. For I am as certain as I can be that a good portion of what makes coming to the United States (or, for that matter, England or Canada or any other nation embracing rule of law and basic ideals of liberal Western democracy) a desire for so many has to do with the freedoms and the safety and the economic opportunity that flow from those ideals.
This being so, it is a reasonable conclusion that to properly serve those immigrants who follow the law, to put them at the head of the line, to align our resources and policy to accommodate and embrace them, and to serve more of them, means that we must stem the flow of those who seek access illegally. In my view, a view not from some theoretical vantage, or from a place where seeking votes is the actual goal, but a view informed by interaction, by having served and having been served, is that it is the antithesis of embracing immigrants to embrace the lawbreaker ahead of the legal. People carry culture with them, and culture can be learned and unlearned. We need to teach a culture of legality.
When we acquiesce to the demands of the illegal as compared to embracing those who demonstrate a culture of legality, we send the wrong message. People carry culture with them, even on to the third and fourth generation, and culture can be learned and unlearned. We need to teach a culture of legality. If we desire to remain a place where immigrants want to come, then we must chose legality over illegality and embrace first and foremost those immigrants who embrace that.
By setting standards, by embracing the admirable, by adhering to ideals that have shown worth and efficacy in producing free and prosperous societies, we will remain a place where immigrants seek to bring the benefits of their abilities and talents. By doing that, we will remain an example, and it is by being an example that we can do the most good.
Realistically, we can’t take in enough people to solve the social and political problems of billions in dozens of countries around the globe. But by being an example and showing the way, we can help billions. It’s Okay if Political Categories Don’t Speak for You
That brings me back to the difficult truth penned by the most admirable Mrs. Adams. At one time, I assumed it was a deficiency in me that caused this inability to pick a political side, to climb into one of the camps on this issue. But the other day, while working out in the field, her thought really hit home.
In considering the positives I see in immigration, balanced with an understanding of the need for the rule of law, I’ve come to a different conclusion than lots of people. That conclusion: it’s those who smugly and sanctimoniously pick a side, adhere to a party line, and are willing to be driven by the political professionals rather than rationally think through such a complex and difficult issue themselves who are the problem.
A final thought: Those “political professionals”—the ones with knowledge of how to drive people emotionally, of how to divert and narrow and conflate and wordsmith such that huge amounts of us become distrustful of one another—I’d venture Mrs. Adams would find them, at best, distasteful and, at worst, dangerous. In her world, a “faction” was something to avoid rather than embrace as a tool for political gain.

Ahead of Tuesday's election, Netanyahu has pledged to annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Oded Balilty / AP
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that he will annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank if he is re-elected.
Netanyahu staked out the position on television on Saturday, ahead of Tuesday's election where he faces a challenge from his former army chief of staff Benny Gantz
The first-time move from the prime minister appears to be aimed at galvanizing support among his nationalist base and right-wing political allies. The annexation of parts of the West Bank would likely be considered the final blow to the possibility of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Netanyahu was asked on Israeli Channel 12 TV why he hasn't annexed Israeli settlement blocs in occupied territory, as NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Jerusalem.
The prime minister replied: ""Will we go to the next phase? The answer is yes. We will go to the next phase to extend Israeli sovereignty.""
""I will impose sovereignty, but I will not distinguish between settlement blocs and isolated settlements,"" he continued, The Associated Press reports. ""From my perspective, any point of settlement is Israeli, and we have responsibility, as the Israeli government. I will not uproot anyone, and I will not transfer sovereignty to the Palestinians.""
On Sunday, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki responded to that pledge and accused the U.S. of encouraging Netanyahu.
""If Netanyahu wants to declare Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, then you know he has to face a real problem, the presence of 4.5 million Palestinians, what to do with them,"" Malki told the AP while attending the World Economic forum in Jordan, apparently citing the combined total of Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.
He said Israel cannot expel the Palestinians, adding, ""The international community has to deal with us.""
Netanyahu has actively supported the growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since the Six-Day War in 1967. But Israel has so far stopped short of formally annexing the West Bank, leaving the door open for further negotiations with Palestinians.
Some 400,000 Israeli settlers and 2.8 million Palestinians now live in in the West Bank .
The Israeli settlements – which include large subdivisions and cities full of middle-class villas – have long complicated efforts for a two-state solution: Palestinians have said the settlements would make it impossible to create a viable state in the West Bank, as NPR's Greg Myre has reported .
Another 200,000 Israelis live in East Jerusalem, part of the West Bank that Israel annexed shortly after the 1967 war.
Saeb Erekat, chief negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization, criticized Netanyahu's statement on Saturday.
""Such a statement by Netanyahu is not surprising,"" Erekat wrote on Twitter . ""Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity, particularly with the Trump Administration's support and endorsement of Israel's violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine.""
Netanyahu's political campaign has emphasized his close ties with President Trump, Estrin reports. In his prime time interview on Saturday, Netanyahu portrayed those moves of support from the Trump administration as his own achievements, the AP reports.
Last month, Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in 1967. In his first year in office, Trump had also recognized Jerusalem — the disputed city claimed as capital by both Israeli and Palestinian people — as Israel's capital, breaking with decades of U.S. foreign policy.
Polls indicate a close race, though Netanyahu's Likud Party and its traditional allies, smaller right-wing parties, are predicted to win a slight majority of the votes. That gives Netanyahu the edge on forming a ruling coalition over Gantz's Blue and White political alliance – unless some right-wing parties choose to side with Gantz, Estrin reports.
Gantz has accused Netanyahu of inciting against Israel's Palestinian Arab citizens and embracing extremists by allying with the far-right Jewish Power Party . Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"
Rep. Schiff: 'No Apology' For Investigating Trump's 'Corruption And Malfeasance',crooksandliars.com,Karoli Kuns,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/rep-schiff-jake-tapper-no-apology,"1 day ago by Heather Views:
CNN's Jake Tapper grilled Rep. Adam Schiff Sunday morning on whether or not Schiff should step down rather than continue to investigate Donald Trump's corrupt relationship with Russia, as Republicans want him to do, forcing Schiff to explain why Tapper is off on the wrong track entirely.
Tapper cannot seem to make the distinction between compromise and criminal activity, or the nuance of a distinction between a ""conspiracy with the Russian government"" that rises to the level of criminal charges and simple corruption at the highest levels of government. He also seems to have difficulty with the concept of Congressional oversight as a tool to root out waste, fraud, and outright corruption in government, preferring instead to parrot Trump administration talking points in place of an interview.
Where was Tapper on the topic of Benghazi hearings, an investigation provably hatched in the dens of right-wing strategy shops? Was he asking Republicans whether they should stop investigating, since there was no evidence of criminal wrongdoing? Well, of course he wasn't. He complained that Bridgegate got more coverage than Benghazi, and even gave Trey Gowdy and the wingnuts a leg up on publicizing what truly was a partisan witch-hunt.
How about Hillary's faux email scandal? You know, the one where she testified before Gowdy's committee for 11 hours about a thing that wasn't a thing? Yes, Tapper was helpful to Republicans there, too. He had Clinton's campaign manager on to discuss what he called the ""email cover-up"" and was gobsmacked that Clinton wouldn't hold a press conference to throw more fuel on the fire.
Then there were the numerous tweets from Tapper basking in all the dirt from the Wikileaks email dumps. Every time they'd dump more, he'd be right there, live-tweeting the nuggets from hacked and stolen emails like they were gold.
But when it comes to Democrats doing their oversight duties, Tapper thinks perhaps ""ethical judgments"" are not something they should engage in because that's what Mick Mulvaney said and everyone knows he's the last word on everything, right?
Schiff put him back in his place, however. ↓ Story continues below ↓
""Now Jake, you've asked the question many times, is there risk of doing too much oversight?"" Schiff said. ""There is a risk when you have an immoral president, a president lacking in basic character who violates the norms of office, there is an even greater risk of doing too little oversight.""
""So, I make no apologies for that. I'm going to continue holding this administration accountable,"" he emphasized.
AMEN.
Full transcript below, with thanks to Heather.
TAPPER: You've been criticized a great deal for saying you still see “evidence of collusion” even though according to Attorney General Barr, the Mueller report says, “the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,: So are you saying that Mueller got it wrong?
SCHIFF: No, and what I've said on your show and others Jake for over a year now was that yes, there's ample evidence of collusion in plain sight, but that is not the same thing as proof of a criminal conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt, and that I would defer to Bob Mueller's judgment and I do.
But I think what we're talking about here is the difference between conduct that rises to the level of criminality and conduct that is deeply unethical, unpatriotic and corrupt but may not be criminal. And I think you saw from Mr. Mulvaney on your show last week and as we've seen from Mr. Nunes and Mr. McCarthy, and attitude that ethics don't matter. If there's no crime, there's no foul. And I think if we get to that point in this country, then we are in a very desperate situation.
TAPPER: You say you think what they did was immoral, unethical and corrupt even if not enough for criminal charges. Mulvaney did tell me on the show last week that ethical judgments are ultimately not your job. […] What's your response, sir?
SCHIFF: Well, that is certainly the president's attitude, it's not the job of Congress to do oversight, period. And indeed under the GOP congress, they did no oversight. But it's our responsibility to root out fraud, corruption, waste, abuse, whether it rises to the level of criminality or not.
If Mr. Mulvaney's standard is Congress can't look unless there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of crime, then Congress would be able to do little or no oversight. That's simply not how Congress should or ever has acted. We need to our legitimate oversight. We need to ferret out any kind of malfeasance or abuse, whether that rises to something the Justice Department can prosecutor not.
TAPPER: How do you respond to the suggestion made by every Republican on your committee, they've called for you to step down, that you going out there before this report came out and saying there's evidence of collusion and then Mueller comes out and says we don't find any evidence of conspiracy or even coordination, that what you're saying and what you said is irresponsible because you're kind of muddying the waters? There is a standard that Mueller has and then you have a different standard and maybe people got confused and maybe the Democrats got their hopes up.
SCHIFF: Look, I think there is a different standard here between the Republicans and the Democrats. The Republicans seem to think that as long as you can't prove it's a crime, then all is fair in love and war, that it's all okay, what the Trump administration, what the Trump campaign does.
I don't feel that way. I don't think most Americans feel that way. And Jake, what I've been saying all along is that the evidence that I'm concerned about is in plain sight, and I've used those words probably 100 times. It's the fact that the president called on the Russians to hack Hillary's emails. It's the fact that or Don Jr. said that he'd love to get the Russian's help. All of this is in plain sight.
If the Republicans think that's perfectly fine because it doesn't amount to the crime of conspiracy, then we are going to part company, and I'm not going to stop making the point that we should hold our president, our campaigns, our elected officials to a higher standard than mere criminality.
TAPPER: And you have no regrets of anything you've said in the last couple years?
SCHIFF: I don't regret calling out this president for what I consider deeply unethical and improper conduct. Not a bit. And I think the moment that we start to think that we should back away from exposing this kind of malfeasance and corruption is a dangerous point.
Now Jake, you've asked the question many times, is there risk of doing too much oversight. There is a risk when you have an immoral president, a president lacking in basic character who violates the norms of office, there is an even greater risk of doing too little oversight. So, I make no apologies for that. I'm going to continue holding this administration accountable.
TAPPER: I don't think that's exactly I phrased that question, but I take your point. Tags:"
