Thinking About Russia: Pigeonholing Doesn’t Work,www.therussophile.org,Peter Crowley,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/thinking-about-russia-pigeonholing-doesnt-work.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Black-and-white thinking rarely works and certainly not about Russia.
Consider the following.
Only days ago, about 100 Russian troops landed in Venezuela to deter a U.S. invasion.
At home, Russian security forces continue to repress pro-democracy movements, dissidents and LGBT rights activists.
The Russian military has long aided the Bashar al-Assad regime, which is responsible for widescale prisoners of war abuse and targeting mass civilians in aerial assaults. Yet this same assistance to Assad has helped prevent another American invasion of a MENA nation.
In 2014, Russia took over Crimea and helped fuel a separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine, which after 5 years of fighting has killed 13,000 people and continues to take civilian lives on a daily basis . This was heavily rooted in NATO’s expansion well beyond U.S. Secretary of State James Baker’s promised boundaries.
Russians understandably credit Vladimir Putin for restoring national pride and bringing the Russian economy out the 1990s gutter. While Russians may not have confidence in their democratic institutions, in 2017, Putin’s approval rating was at 80%.
Russia employed soft power efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election on behalf of Donald Trump, but this likely had a negligible impact on the outcome. Democrats should face it – the American people are responsible for electing a lunatic in a baby carriage.
How can Russian’s diverse array of behavior be understood?
Within the context of all the world’s governments, Russia is moderately repressive at home. It also is an occasional protector of sovereignty abroad.
Yet there are important caveats.
Sovereignty will be protected by Russia even if the foreign leader is a war criminal, but not if the nation is within the traditional Russian/Soviet sphere of influence, such as Ukraine or Georgia. Then, it will employ soft power efforts to maintain a Russian-leaning leader in power. When the U.S. disturbs this ecosystem, as in the Euromaidan overthrow, a Russian invasion may eschew soft power, and with it, national autonomy.
Russia has acted as a check on U.S. power. Unlike in the early 2000s, when the U.S. had free reign to invade countries while Russia was recovering from vulture capitalism, Russia has been back on its feet for well over a decade. Because it acts as a check on American power, Russia is a demonized enemy. This pervades into U.S. pop culture, where Russia and other Eastern Europeans are often depicted as backward and of totalitarian inclination, such as in the sitcoms Jane the Virgin and New Girl .
Russia demonization has long been politicized.
The 2017 FBI memo on Russian election interference focused heavily on Russian media influence, such as RT and Sputnik , while failing to add any evidence connecting the DNC hacks by Guccifer 2.0 to Russian intelligence agents. Yet, still Russian interference is a media parade and a Democratic strategy to retake the White House in 2020. Mueller’s recent report may not even have put an end to this.
As Russia and the U.S. engage in atavistic great power politics, China is, more quietly, expanding its global reach through the 5G network and the Belt Road Initiative. Whether Chinese infrastructural loans will place host nations in a virtual debt prison remains to be seen. Yet one has to wonder whether this debtor prison will be any worse than IMF loan obligations, often tied to subverting nations’ economic policies to the IMF’s demands. The U.S. attempts to oppose Chinese soft power efforts, such as through having Canada arrest Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou. Yet it’s an exercise in futility as the U.S. and Russia, for that matter, have nothing better to offer. Therefore, Italy, despite its membership in the EU and NATO, recently signed on to China’s Belt and Road initiative.
So, what of Russia?
Russia is no demon. It is far from the world’s most oppressive nations, such as el-Sisi’s Egypt, Duterte’s Philippines, occupied Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar and others. But Russia is also far from a human rights-protecting nation; it supports national sovereignty largely as a Machiavellian means-to-end to keep American power at bay.
As all nations, Russia acts according to its own perceived interests, which are neither black nor white. It sometimes protects the sovereignty of nations, but primarily when they are not within its historic sphere of influence and, especially, when they U.S. has a mind to invade them.
And Russia did not elect Donald Trump. We did.

Lessons for Progressives from Bob Mueller — and the Valerie Plame Affair,www.therussophile.org,Charles Davis,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/lessons-for-progressives-from-bob-mueller-and-the-valerie-plame-affair.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
If one of Donald Trump’s oafish sons outed a covert intelligence agent tomorrow — in an angry tweet disclosing their party registration or in a clumsy boast to an Instagram thirst-trap — it would prompt a newscycle of clucking from former national security officials and their conventionally liberal interrogators. A spook would call it “treason,” a cable-news Democrat would say it’s “treasonous,” and the alleged traitor himself would either apologize, half-heartedly, or double down in appearance on Fox & Friends. Life, for better or worse, would go on. Nothing matters.
In terms of ultimate consequences, this would not be altogether different than what happened under the presidency of George W. Bush. Back then, the ghoulish vice president’s chief of staff, Scooter Libby, got caught leaking the name of clandestine CIA agent Valerie Plame, an act of retaliation spurred by Plame’s ex-diplomat husband, Joseph Wilson, and his undermining the White House’s claims about Iraq with more accurate testimony of his own — the “Deep State” conspiracy of the mid-2000s. There was a special counsel and an indictment, albeit not for the underlying crime but for lying to investigators, and while everyone pretty much knew something like this wouldn’t have happened without at least a wink from up top, no one above Libby ever faced a trial.
It was a disappointment for progressives, some of whom had turned prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald into a pin-up, but few outside the right considered it an exoneration. “Legal or not, the Plame leak was wrong,” wrote David Corn , then-Washington editor of The Nation . “One doesn’t need indictments — or convictions — to see this case as a clear representation of the way Bush and his crew do business.” The involvement of higher ups like Karl Rove was not in question (the senior Bush operative had been caught misleading investigators), and most suspected Dick Cheney’s chief of staff wouldn’t out a spook without at least a nod from his boss, but neither was charged with a crime.
Fitzgerald may have determined he lacked a powerful enough case, but then weaker cases are prosecuted every day; one should always be mindful that those with the most power never face the same justice as those with the least (Libby had his sentence commuted by Bush before receiving a full, message-sending pardon from Trump). All on the left who cared about this affair, and were concerned that the world’s most powerful reactionaries were getting away with it, had no illusions about Valerie Plame’s employer and what it did: a lot of evil. Sympathy was tactical; when conservatives attacked the agency and its employees for being pinkos undermining a militarist, there was an understanding that they were doing so for bad reasons; no one cheered this as justice for Salvador Allende.
Could the left maturely address such a matter today, or would the siren’s call of aloof vulgarity prove too strong? To ask is to already know the answer — there is hardly a need for a thought experiment here. We already have this Russia stuff: the emails hacked by the government of Russia, laundered to WikiLeaks and openly welcomed by the Trump campaign, a fact — that this was happening, and that it mattered — mocked by the most avowedly cynical pundits among us even as these same people breathlessly reported on emailed banalities fed to them by the intelligence operation in question. The report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, or the Trump administration’s brief summary of it, has been welcomed with an unsettling glee by those who have long denied what it only confirmed: that the DNC break-in was carried out by the Russian government to help elect the current president.
Forget Valerie Plame: if Watergate were to happen now, righteous commentators would be defending their stories on what G. Gordon Liddy found in the DNC’s office, while at the same dismissing its relevance to an election that saw the Democratic nominee lose 49 states.
It is certainly a disappointment that we live in a world where a former FBI director did not, per the Attorney General’s summary, build a legally viable case for the unprecedented removal of a U.S. president from office. An excitable few may have expected that, but I suspect most of them are made of straw. Even so, it is of note that this is still no official exoneration, either: William Barr’s stated reason for not pursuing televised-and-tweeted obstruction of justice — the sort of thing that can prevent a prosecutor from obtaining the clear evidence needed to successfully prosecute a criminal conspiracy at the highest level — is that the underlying crime was not proven. The logic is more coherent than we’re used to from figures in the Trump administration, but it is nonetheless circular.
It is likewise strange for the successful prosecution of a sitting president, or an official accusation of treason against them, to be a progressive standard for assessing whether a crime was committed. By June 2016 it was known beyond all but a Kremlin apologist’s doubt that Russian military intelligence had hacked the Democrats and created a persona, Guccifer 2.0, to disseminate what they stole. The Trump campaign knew this even earlier thanks to its own contacts with Russian intelligence cutouts. Still, the future president’s son, Donald Jr., nonetheless accepted a meeting that month with a Russian lawyer based on the belief that he was about to receive “high level and sensitive information” on Hillary Clinton as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”
“ I love it ,” the son responded, a couple days before the DNC announced it had been hacked the same government. Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal lawyer at the time, told Congress he believes the future president was aware of the meeting — and that, “ yes ,” he’d totally do collusion, if he could. Both exchanges read like liberal fanfiction, and would be dismissed as such in most other universes.
But we live in this one, and it is crucial that the left live there too, where an outcome one may not otherwise care about, has real implications for how power, always learning, behaves in the future. It is not a good thing when the most powerful man in the world can openly obstruct justice. Aside from the issue of collusion — so narrowly defined by Trump’s Attorney General as to exclude anything but an explicit agreement between the campaign and an actual government official, on the specific issue of hacking the DNC — Trump openly sought to prevent others from settling the questions around Russian anti-democratic actions in the 2016 election. This, like the commander in chief’s open fondness for authoritarianism at home and abroad, is another unfortunate lesson for those who will follow him, here and elsewhere.

Facebook’s Follies,www.therussophile.org,David Rosen,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/facebooks-follies.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Photograph by LPS.1 – Wikimedia Commons
Incompetence, Willful Blindness or the Profit Motive?
The killing of 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15 th , once again raised mea culpas from executives at Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, among other social-networking companies. They were exposed as having helped facilitate the widespread distribution of videos of the killings.
Facebook livestreamed the gunman’s 17-minute videos and, as The Guardian reported, it kept it online for 6 hours and YouTube for 3 hours after the slaughters; it reported subsequently removing around 1.5 million videos of the killings. The company’s COO, Sheryl Sandberg, said she identified 900 different variations of the Christchurch shooter’s original livestream. The Guardian also reported that some sites posted the attacker’s full 74-page manifesto.
In the wake of mounting criticism about its role sustain on-going promotion of the attacks on the mosques, Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg published an op ed in The Washington Post on March 30 th that spoke to the company’s – and media-tech industries – inability to manage the social-network content that is helping foster white nationalist and separatist militancy culminating in killings.
Showing his desperation in the face of wide-spread criticism, Zuckerberg momentarily changed his long-held free-market, anti-regulation attitude and wrote:
I believe we need a more active role for governments and regulators. By updating the rules for the Internet, we can preserve what’s best about it — the freedom for people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things — while also protecting society from broader harms.
From what I’ve learned, I believe we need new regulation in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.
Floundering as to how to respond to a system out of control, Zuckerberg is throwing ideas at the wall hoping something sticks. He’s calling for the creation of an independent “supreme court” to oversee content and for the global adoption of an EU-like General Data Protection Regulations. On March 27 th , the company instituted a ban on “praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism on Facebook and Instagram”.
Many were shocked by the mass murders in Christchurchand the ways Facebook and other social-networking sites feasted on the events. Sadly, it will likely not be the last killings that they help facilitate.
Forgotten by the media, one year ago, in April 2018, Zuckerberg appeared before the U.S. Congress in the wake of revelations that 87 million Facebook users had their privacy rights violated. Escorted by his $12 million lobbying team, the aw-shucks billionaire placated the legislators with high-minded odes of tech blather.
“Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company. For most of our existence, we focused on all the good that connecting people can bring,” Zuckerberg opined. He puffed on,“it’s not enough to just connect people, we have to make sure those connections are positive. It’s not enough to just give people a voice, we have to make sure people aren’t using it to hurt people or spread misinformation.”
Zuckerbergthen admitted that little of significance would happen, saying, “it will take some time to work through all of the changes we need to make, but I’m committed to getting it right.” A year later, he stood in dumb disbelief as the Christchurch horror played out.
But wasn’t this the same Zuckerberg gee-wiz posture eight-months before he appeared in Congress when the riot and killing took place in the wake of the Charlottesville, VA,“Unite the Right” rally in August 2017? Then he wrote, “There is no place for hate in our community.” He then added, “that’s why we’ve always taken down any post that promotes or celebrates hate crimes or acts of terrorism – including what happened in Charlottesville.” Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, Squarespace, PayPal, GoDaddy, YouTube and other online networks claimed that they suspended hundreds of users associated with the far-right.
The Facebook CEO failed to acknowledge that the Southern Poverty Law Center had provided it with a list of hate groups and that, as The Guardian reported, in July 2017 “at least 175 of those links remained active.”
These are but a few of the ever-growing number of questionable incidents that Facebook has been involved in during the last couple of years; they’ve had deeply disturbing consequence that the company has shrugged off. In 2018, the New York Times broke the story that the company had retained aRepublican opposition-research firm, Definers Public Affairs, to discredit activist organizations, notably Color of Change that is part of Freedom From Facebook coalition, and the “liberal” philanthropist George Soros and his Open Society Foundations. Zuckerberg denied any knowledge of the strategy, claiming he“learned about this reading the New York Times yesterday.” And then there is Facebook’s role in promoting “false news” during the 2016 presidential election campaign, Russia-Gate and the Cambridge-Analytic scandal that is still playing out.
Equally troubling, in February 2018, as the Times reported, a 19-year-old man who confessed to the killings at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, had two accounts with Instagram, a Facebook subsidiary. Classmates said that the killer’s lockers were filled with images of weaponry as well as the hats and bandannas he liked to wear to school. The killer reportedly wrote that he hated “jews, ni**ers, immigrants,” and talked about killing Mexicans, keeping black people in chains and cutting their necks.
Facebook and the other social-network services are in a peculiarly American position – they are private companies that can freely distribute (almost) any and all content so long as they wish to or so long as they can make money from it. They are not telecom networks, but rather content distribution platforms; they are more like Amazon and Walmart, aggregators of content, than the roadways and parking lots that facilitate transportation. As such, online platforms do not need to comply with (however weak) net-neutrality requirements. Thus, they face little federal regulation, only the oldest art of public shaming.
These companies are governed by the Communications Decency Act (CDA), adopted in 1996, and especially Section 230. It protects online platform operators from defamation lawsuits, from any liability associated with user-generated content. The statute states: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) cautions, “ Though there are important exceptions for certain criminal and intellectual property-based claims, CDA 230 creates a broad protection that has allowed innovation and free speech online to flourish.”
In April 2018, Pres. Trump signed an act that revised Sec. 230. It reconciled the Senate’s Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) and the House’s Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA). It was ostensibly targeted at sex trafficking but is really intended to further criminalize all forms of commercial sex work. The Justice Department conflated trafficking with sex work in its successful effort to close down the website backstage.com
Facebook is in free fall reflecting the fundamental contradictions of postmodern capitalism. It is a private company providing a social service; it is a U.S. company in an increasingly globalized economy; and it is driven to maximize profits.
The Intercept undertook a covert operation that graphically exposed this contraction. It used “white genocide conspiracy theory” as a pre-defined “detailed targeting” criterion and published two articles target 168,000 Facebook users. They were defined as “people who have expressed an interest or like pages related to White genocide conspiracy theory.” It reveals that the paid promotion was approved by Facebook’s advertising wing. It ends reminding readers that “after we contacted the company for comment, Facebook promptly deleted the targeting category, apologized, and said it should have never existed in the first place.”
Incompetence, willful blindness or the profit motive? – take your pick.

“I speak only one language, and it is not my own.”
—Jacques Derrida
“The stereotype of the public intellectual, from Fareed Zakaria of Newsweek International to Christopher Hitchens, the freelance British gadfly, would offer statements describing US policy, coming out promptly in response to every crisis. This is undoubtedly worthy, often requiring personal courage, but it is not a response. It enhances the charisma of the intellectual and produces in the reader a feeling of being in the thick of things.”
—Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak
“The representation of private interests … abolishes all natural and spiritual distinctions by enthroning in their stead the immoral, irrational and soulless abstraction of a particular material object and a particular consciousness which is slavishly subordinated to this object.”

“In recent years I have concluded that there is a strong penchant among some sectors on the left to desire glorification of leaders and strongmen (and they’re almost always men) who espouse a favored political position in opposition to the U.S.”

“You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitist? Tell that to the kids in the South Bronx, which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country. Tell that to the families in Flint, whose kids have—their blood is ascending in lead levels. Their brains are damaged for the rest of their lives. Call them elitist.”
—Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

“Woman is the opposite, the ‘other’ of man: she is non-man, defective man, assigned a chiefly negative value in relation to the male first principle. But equally man is what he is only by virtue of ceaselessly shutting out this other or opposite, defining himself in antithesis to it, and his whole identity is therefore caught up and put at risk in the very gesture by which he seeks to assert his unique, autonomous existence.”

“It seems to me that the binary opposition that is so much embedded in Western thought and language makes it nearly impossible to project a complex response.”
—bell hooks
All of those on the left agree that the Russiagate story was a distraction at best. What remains deeply troubling though is that the entire (anti) establishment continues to position Russiagate itself as the boogeyman in the era of neoliberal fascism. Rather than confront the present fascist threat in the White House the opposition remains focused on defending Trump.
This is first and foremost a trait of Trump supporters. Their embrace of fascism as simply the binary opposition to neoliberalism is not only perilous but reflects a mindset that remains deeply colonized by the manipulation of thought in a conversation completely dictated by the 1%. It is only this context, with a mass media and educational apparatus abandoned by both political parties an embrace of fascism primarily as a mode of opposition when in fact there is nothing oppositional about it. This is a society totally bound to militarism and colonialism as its logic. It is a society that has abandoned the material needs of its own working class. It is a society that has morally and spiritually collapsed as the public institutions necessary to hold it up have been systematically dismantled by the 1%.
In addition, the present propaganda apparatus has so many modes of operation in the media that it is difficult to transcend the colonizing process of thought production. The propaganda, with near complete control by the 1%, bombards the citizen who consumes it and forces a response. This article will try to argue that responding strictly in opposition to this propaganda in just as problematic as believing it. In addition, this response is just as limiting, predictable and controlled because it is an elicited response.
What the so-called opposition is doing now is fighting for a side that needs no assistance. Putin’s Russia a far cry from communism, but this fight was never really about Putin or Russia, for any of the sides involved. This was always a fight over the chief collaborator with Russia, U.S. President Donald Trump.
Donald Trump is attacked relentlessly by the corporate press. They treat him with open disdain that has no recent historical precedent. This is certainly well-deserved, but ultimately counterproductive. The media itself is so unpopular that Trump gains popularity simply by positioning himself as Public Enemy #1. Furthermore, the amount of air time given to Trump amounts to free advertising for Trump himself. The corrupt media also gets something out of covering Trump: more profits.
Indeed, Russiagate can largely be viewed as a ratings scam. An old, yet familiar story of Cold War villains was the number 1 story for over two years. Furthermore, the investigation itself never seemed to be focused on the ways it could actually uncover any real facts. The storyline and the ratings to come from it drove the whole plot.
All dramas in the US are more or less cowboy and Indian. Cops are celebrated because they are cowboys and their lawlessness represents a sort of unlimited freedom for the American individual even when they often bring exactly the opposite. And now in this scenario both Mueller and Trump are cowboys. Trump has the frontier, Mueller has the badge. And the left, as well as more and more people are becoming more skeptics of the badge which is good. Black Lives Matter has brought this a long ways. But it is apparent that there has been little alternative developed. At least not yet.
But one could argue that this repositioning of the plot as cowboy vs. cowboy reveals a couple of things. One is the complete silencing of the Indian character, which obviously most applies to real Native Americans, who are entirely left out of all stories. The other is that the ruling class has responded to this hackneyed narrative of cowboy vs. Indian being discredited in many circles. The side of the binary to choose is increasingly obvious not only as the 1% gains power. Therefore the binary must be muddled into easily triggering categories that elicit responses. With Trump, his illiberalism triggers responses. But with the Democrats, there are equally predictable reasons to oppose them as a singular entity rather than a product of a false binary ruling class. These road signs should be avoided precisely because they are manufactured. Anti-elitism when manufactured by the ruling class does us no favors.
The way this power works is like the relationship between ranchers and law enforcement. Both believe in the same environmental degradation and ethnic cleansing and have the same smug masculinity so we therefore see a sort of allegiance by default even when specific interests are at odds. This was clearly the dynamic of Mueller and Trump where Mueller had a job to do and he could do anything but actually accomplish it beyond what amounts to theatre.
And along the way of course it is this story that is privileged as one of interest while others are left out. And the left gets this but seems to at the same time finds some sort of truth to come from the results of this mirage. This idea that somehow we were right is sick when one considers the implications. It also doesn’t really prove anything because the report is still hidden and Trump is still guilty.
And there remain so many excuses by the right and left. The Cold War fantasy is fantastical as Russiagate itself. When the story is framed as elitist this only marks an obsession with the propaganda itself while ignoring Trump’s real destruction with the working class. The war on working class continues as all sides ignore everything outside their own relationship to the ruling class.
Robert Mueller, who was head of the FBI for a very shameful period, headed this investigation. Mueller’s relationship to the Republican Party as well as truth in general should have raised red flags. More red flags still should have come when Trump hired Mueller’s good friend William Barr to be his attorney general and to oversee Mueller’s investigation. Trump publicly feuded with Mueller in the press, but privately he may have been buttering up the man who was investigating him.
Russiagate is unimportant on all grounds. If there was an opposition who was more focused on substance perhaps there would be more means to worry about the implications of this story. As it stands we have the same political scene we have had for the last 25 years. The right rules, the center acts as a disingenuous foil and the left remains nowhere to be found. For the right to be defeated a genuine populist left needs to rise. The non-starter of Russiagate that was constructed by Democrats has only proven how inept that group truly is.
Positioning Russiagate itself as the danger to society shows that this opposition is still stuck in the binary thinking of the corporate duopoly. The left at times is too keen to outflank Democrats who never have shown an ounce of interest in leftism. This, if the left does have any influence, this collapse of our imagination has far more damning implications than anything the hapless Democrats could think of.
This endless defense of Trump as a form of obsession is dangerous precisely because Trump is positioning himself as the populist anti-establishment figure in a space of subversion the left has historically occupied. In the absence of a strong left, populist right-wing forces have risen up as a rebellion against demoralizing neoliberal economic policies. The results have been fatal for the environment, the stateless and the working poor as a whole.
Fascists like Trump frame themselves as against the status quo precisely because it is an easy and popular position. If the left has no principles of its own what is to stop us from being swallowed up by these same forces? Rather than spend so much time and energy denouncing the attempt to oust a fascist from power, the left would do well to tell people what we are actually for. Because being against Russiagate is just as uninspiring and even more perilous than being against Trump.
There is a present moment. It is fascism. If the left cannot be firmly against this moment and all those responsible, what on earth are they good for? The focus remains on discrediting Russiagate for ideological reasons when practical ones clearly indicate that this stance only makes excuses for the fascist regime in power. Imagine if the left rushed to the defense of the Clintons in the same way just because they hated the Republicans. It would be disgraceful.
Trump effectively discredits those critical of his crimes by calling them elitist or by threatening them with violence or conflict if they continue to press him. It is concerning that the left has taken up these two tools in regards to Russiagate. Any attempt to impeach Trump who has arguably been the worst President for the working class in American history is now described as some sort of elitist conspiracy simply because Democrats have the same goal. And a truly fantastical World War III scenario is trotted out every time someone dares to question Trump’s corruption. This is not a realistic scenario, it is a threat of violence.
The opposition won’t win by shame or by force here. There should be no fear in saying that one opposes Donald Trump and would like to do curtail his power and credibility by all means necessary. Ousting Trump is a radical stance. The Democrats faux investigation of him proves that there is no resistance party. Nancy Pelosi doesn’t even want to impeach him anymore. By making excuse after excuse for The Donald, the left sounds just as tepid as the Democrats themselves.
The working class and the world we live in have little time for meta leftist fantasies about being some sort of McCarthyist threat to the Democrats. The real authoritarianism lies exactly where power is, as it always has. The left is opposed to Trump in every way but the way that will get him out of office. His victory is not ours. His populism and Democrat bashing is phony. They are all on the same team. And it’s not ours. Empowering Donald Trump to evade justice for his crimes is collaborating with the bipartisan establishment plot. This plot aims to keep the working class suffering too much to rebel and organize. This plot aims to keep the citizen occupied with their own image. This image knows exactly what it hates, but has no idea what it stands for. Donald Trump proves that this nihilist stance only keeps the door open for fascism in the name of working class rebellion to the grand conspiracies of the time.
But let’s expand our analysis to the Trump Presidency and Russiagate in general. Now the first thing we must notice is that the way media is constant. There must be new material everyday, nay every hour, or however often you check Facebook. This relationship that the media has is one to profit. The story is something to be consumed. This is why Russiagate could continue for literally years and basically provide nothing new the entire time.
One also has to say that the motive is not entirely profit driven in the immediacy for this reason: this scandal was overplayed to the point of over-saturation. But then again maybe the consumer simply doesn’t care. This story became an expression of victory over Trump, although it may be important that the conclusion was just the opposite. And like an orgasm, despite its similarities it is repeated simply because it only uses narrative as a vehicle for a repeating climatic end and therefore the narrative only needs to drive, it never needs to sustain, or even interest as long it is moving.
This acts as a substitution for a feeling that we all know: Donald Trump is horrible and we want this to stop. But the mainstream media and the Democrats are incapable of providing this tangibly. Now maybe they could get Trump out of office. But then they would need to be different than him for this move to make sense politically. Which they aren’t, or at least they would be a disappointment. So this acts as its own distraction in a time of crisis for all people in power. And then there also is the related aspect that what Trump is actually doing, whether that be the destruction of the environment, the deregulation, the war on education, health care, unions, even the crude expression of masculine valor that punishes the underclass—well there is difference only in degree here, if any difference at all between Trump’s resistance and Trump himself.
Therefore this presents a crisis for the ruling class in the long term even more than the short term. Trump’s political embrace of the values of the ruling class is not their problem with him. This is the only reason such an incompetent manager of class relations even works. He merely moves the plot and therefore gets more done than he appears to. The problem is that he presents materially is a deeper problem that can’t yet be resolved as the focus remains so much on the largely exterior plot rather than the internal structures of capital that are having severe environmental effects to the point of the collapse of civilization as we know it.
Trump obviously presents a fear for everybody, or at least the suspicion of future unrest. Because he arose as a character, not manufactured by anything other than a crisis of society. He was not groomed in the same way as Obama, Bush or Clinton as some sort of stock character. He is just a stock character on his own, which is why he is no different and not really a threat to the ruling class unless they actually put their values before their money, which they never would do, because those are the same thing for them.
This character is latched onto as an expression of desperation and a base cynicism that either Trump is right or that we can do no better. He also of course is opposed, but when done by the ruling class, this is only in the way they are different from him. This difference is limited. While the ruling class may do the same things as each other they occupy different bodies, obviously. So the physical removal of Trump from office becomes the focus while his actual actions cannot be opposed besides some of the more ridiculous ones.
But even this physical removal was largely insincere when in the hands of the machine that seems to have adjusted to Trump. Both in the specific actions of the actors and in the scope of the investigation. An undemocratic constitution played a role too.
Regardless, even if there was a more logical attempt to remove Trump from office the whole affair was theatre, even if the end game had consequences. The left presents themselves as all-knowing of the propaganda that governs our lives because they don’t believe it. This is a fine step, but a rather flimsy one. What does one believe? And if wisdom is simply by negation, it ceases to have meaning.
But perhaps the negation is the problem, as it is at the very least, a first step in the process of being disillusioned with the present injustice. What we see that is more troubling is this reproduction of theatre in the response itself. Now just as Russiagate had no goal besides the one it accomplished we can say that the left has been compromised by Russiagate.
And not in the way liberals have. No one was sitting on the edge of their seat waiting for the FBI to save them. Rather the left was engaging in the theatre of the system failing. Every time the media lied, the left knew its own truth. Every time the media failed, the left knew it would have been more successful. But this is strictly engaging in the rules of engagement that have little if anything to do with the struggle of the working class.
This is the main point. The rules of engagement are still being dictated by the 1% when the propaganda is seen as interesting or important. And it is this privileging of an elitist narrative, even when it simultaneously disowned, that makes one think that it is still the ruling class that has complete control over the entirely of ideas that enter into the debate. This is a financial grip obviously. Look at net neutrality, which is potentially fatal to thought, but perhaps in its own way an accerationalist gift. But there is a more deep connection. Which is to the ruling class ideology as some sort of truth simply because it is produced and handed to us.
Using the word truth maybe makes this more confusing. But it a far deeper truth than the factual truth, which few believe when coming from the ruling class. To use a religious analogy. The congregation may not believe in heaven but they are still paying their dues at Church and attending every Sunday. This when believing in heaven may have been the only merit anyways, and the only thing that actually came from working people. Much like this new distrust in elitist education and science and facts only works in reverse of its intended goal of punishing elites.
Furthermore the goal of protecting Trump as some sort of proof of a broken system mirrors the accelerationism theories and even leads one to believe that there is a general nihilism that intrinsically supports Trump at least in a spiritual sense. And this is deeply troubling. And it’s not because of Trump, not really. And it’s not because anyone on the left supports Trump, let alone is a Russian agent or something. It is more to do with the fact that such a conclusion that is naturally bad for the world can be met with some sort of personalized victory as if the left ever had any role in this whole affair.
It seems like a last-gasp effort to assert ourselves within this production by the ruling class. And this is the central difference between the types of populism we see. There is the conservative populism that identifies with the ruling class much in the same way the wife votes for Trump. This presents a world where there is so little hope in communal uprising. As a result everyone more or less takes up things for themselves and pretends they are ruling class even when they have no power other than to identify with the oppressor both to get something from the oppressor (good luck) and just to feel like him. And one shouldn’t get too upset with this sort of populism, even if it has deeply consequential effects. It’s victim-blaming mostly to do so.
There is another kind of populism that does not identify with the ruling class and is even uninterested in the ruling class besides in discovering how to overthrow them. Unfortunately in America we see such an internalized hatred of self, humanity and environment that there is also a knee-jerk reaction to claim victory when our rulers do—whether that be for Trump or in war.
The collapse of populism is evident here. We are living in a mass incarceration state that treats children as criminals and models schools after prisons. There becomes a collapse of the logic of class consciousness as the war on Trump is seen as a continuation rather than a break from the rising mass incarceration state that criminalizes citizens just for being poor. The framing of Trump as a victim reflects the only populism that is allowed to be heard. There is a position of the powerful as the victim that only justifies the future crackdown on the poor. See 9/11.
This marks itself as a problem the higher you go up. With Trump and his base, this is the central mode of governing, if you can even call this anti-governing standpoint to be governing. This belief that by dismantling every single health and safety law, there is some sort of freedom (see Ralph Nader’s analysis). They can only operate from this position of reprioritizing which only reinforces the present hierarchy in place. And we have this most obviously when Trump and his base cry about lost opportunities in order to justify splitting apart immigrant families, as if that isn’t a lost opportunity.
Or look at Brett Kavanaugh, another sort of public theater operation which acted to demoralize the public and remind us that this country simply doesn’t care about violence against women. In fact many people like it, identify with it, and want to live through this act as a form of bonding. While of course Kavanaugh himself is such a corporate stooge he basically continues this logic of violence against the entire working class with many of them somehow identifying with him through the largely spiritual connection stated above.
But this is a creeping logic. And this logic has basically has taken over the Democratic Party too. This obsession over Russiagate was all about their egos. They hated losing to Trump and rather than fix anything he is doing they wanted to prove they were better than him through some sort of “pure” test of a fair democracy that doesn’t come close to existing in this country. Ironically much of that lack of democracy has to do from Republicans rigging elections, which no Democrat will say, even if that might help in proving their point.
Democrats focus more on their own demise, the loss of their own values, etc. What those values are remain somewhat distant from the material reality. Science they say. Climate change is real. But about the Green New Deal? Democracy they say. But what about money in politics? Giving everyone their fair share they say. But what about Wall St.? Their identification with power is not quite so severe as the Republicans, specifically Trump, whose rudimentary function is the bully. The Democrats are more stuck in between what is clearly an oligarchy and a base that clearly wants something else.
Yet this identification with power remains. And it could cynically be called “practical”. Which it is, obviously. But to what ends? What point is there in electing someone who identifies with the ultra-rich for practical reasons? There is a more innate identification too. The idea that America is supposed to care that these people lost to Trump or that it would be in any justice in seeing these Wall St. dependent corporate elites in office. I mean why would anyone feel bad for them? Yes they may have a few less lines they cross but even if they lose their homes are nicer than everyone else’s, they are getting their health care payed for, etc. They don’t really understand this dynamic at all.
But then there too is the left. Who is positioning itself as the lead in this drama when they don’t even have a speaking role. There is an emphasis on this theoretical Cold War that reimagines the left as a vibrant force in this country. And it distracts from those who can’t speak. It acts as a sort of violence against the real victims of the Trump administration, who would be helped by a real investigation. Which Mueller never did, but it also hasn’t been released yet.
So you have this identification with power once again. And it is a little more complicated here. Where you see this sort of rabid energy directed vaguely against the ruling class but actually seems to be chiefly narcissistic as it more focuses on the subject’s own fall. This is where one has to be very specific about this anger, which is justified many times over.
Because Trump channels it. He speaks about corruption and wages dropping and trade deals and war and everything else the left does. Which is probably why the left continues to apologize for him. But Trump redirects this energy against the poor, specifically against immigrants, while fostering this entitled male energy that takes up more space than it deserves to.
So we have to be very careful here. There is a clear crisis in the legitimacy of the established order. But which way will this go? Because it can get worse. And Trump makes it worse. No one can deny that. Without being very specific about what the real problem is (the 1%) we have an anger that basically begins and ends with the self and therefore focuses primarily on the problems that are visible. Hawk Rachel Maddow for some reason is seen as an intellectual, or maybe there is some problem in someone’s personal life that is hard and you blame people you love, or maybe you blame the local teacher who mails it in but isn’t really getting paid or maybe you blame an immigrant. But the point is that every single one of these things is a distraction. All of them are a product of an oligarchy.
One can look at basically any product of the media and see it as this sort of division that is meant to lead the anger away from the 1% who intentionally remain hidden. And this includes partisan politics too. Which is why it remains a distraction for the left to be so up in arms about Russiagate when there are real problems going on that happen precisely because of the wealth gap and the democracy gap. And identifying with a billionaire, even if it is just with his supposedly subversive energy, this is dangerous.
There is a tendency to focus on this bourgeois drama because the truth is too hard to bare. The real tragedy of this administration cannot and will not be dealt with by anyone within the sensationalist and self-absorbed ruling class from right to left. This brings one to the conclusion that politics and the ideology behind it are secondary, although certainly not inconsequential. Instead class should take the central spot, not just in politics, but above it.
For we see this cultural appropriation of class coming along every step of the way which naturally can only be said by those privileged enough to be heard. Perhaps then class is not a culture. Trump proves this. He is the ruling class fantasy of a poor person: angry, dangerous, lazy and resentful. Rather, class is a material position with material consequences.
Anti-Russiagate may have been a largely forgettable matter, even more so than Russiagate itself. But it did teach this lesson: any politics divorced from the material will never be relevant. What we saw was a lot of sides appearing to disagree when really there was a clear class collusion, even if it was only spiritually, and largely unknowingly. There was a class collusion for about two years that stated that in one way or another politics superseded class. That it mattered more if you were on the right, left or center then it did if you were poor, and therefore vulnerable to the real material violence of the Trump administration and the ruling class behind it.
The failure is that people actually identify with a character within the plot, rather than being able to understand that the production of the circus itself was what keeps the viewer at a place where they aren’t represented in a democratic sense. The fact that the left chose the wrong character hardly matters, the bigger worry is the identification with anyone within the story. For the play can only be consumed. The audience is never given a speaking role other than to applaud.
And this essentially marks a point in our society where the citizen feels so unrepresented that they have to identify with someone within the ruling class to feel as if they have a voice.
The tendency to dismiss Trump in every way but the one in question actually mirrors much of the leftist dismissal of #MeToo. Here the logic of the left‘s criticisms were outweighed by their glaring tendencies to discredit in the interest of power as a sort of ideological thrust against what was practically relevant. This effort of course is disguised in left Puritanism that always applies so one has to wonder if it was ever the point. If there was a breaking point of this logic, would it ever have presented itself beyond past Gods of socialist history?
Neoliberalism has effectively dismantled public spaces and institutions as we know them. What will rise in its place? It’s a dangerous time, and a pivotal one. Without the institutions necessary to foster a healthy democracy we have cheap replacements formed that alienate. Combined with longer working hours we have a further alienation and isolation. Hence the reason for the truly tone deaf nature of the class divisions in this country.
Liberals sense the left-right spiritual connection with Trump, somehow. They play to it and use it to further fracture the resistance to their failed rule. They aren’t entirely wrong, however. There is on the one hand a cannibalizing populism that leaves the poor on a desert island with the only food being each other. This is called democracy. For those silly enough to have any “analysis” of this dynamic beyond a purely material one we have this cannibalizing populism in reverse.
The rich fights with itself not in a material way, for the rich are rich enough where there needs to be no material battle. Rather the rich fight over ideas and morals, because they lack both, and some of these ideas are politics. This politics becomes very loud but hardly amounts to any real war because no side really wants it, let alone needs it. It is in its way, a Cold War!
Yes the real Cold War may be between the American middle class itself. Between those who feel the pain, those who don’t, those who want to think, those who can’t bare to. Fascinating stuff. The work of high art. But it’s a different fight than say will you pay for my health care or have me die? It’s more of a debate than that, no matter how shrinking our democratic institutions are.
In this shrinking reality we have a debate about what is really elitist. Sort of, to quote that ‘Russian agent’ Jill Stein, a fireside chat. With the fireside being the burning world. This is not to draw false equivalencies. This is actually the biggest problem with the ruling left/right. It is more to say that while the chat may be animated, it is not in the fire, it is on the side. And thank God for that! And this is not to say the ruling class debate is without consequence either. Who else is making decisions? I mean why on earth are the Democrats killing the Green New Deal? Even if that’s a ruling class ploy, one has to say it’s a damn good one.
And yet there clearly is something that is corruptible here, which rarely presents itself for some of the best of us. That is the violence of the ruling class. The silencing of the poor precisely because they do not fit within the ideology of the ruling class who created the very conditions for poor people to have the beliefs they do.
Take the latest spirit animal, whatever you want to call the President of Venezuela. The left joins in with the right and center in a class violence that denies the real suffering in Venezuela in order to justify its own ideology. Oddly enough if this ideology was actually applied we wouldn’t see this suffering. But saying Maduro is corrupt or has done bad things well that is seen as a political crime by the left. When in reality it is a class crime not to point out that poor Venezuelans are suffering.
Now that should be the first priority. Keeping track of the poor. Afterwards you can come with up with an ideology to help. The crisis in Venezuela is 100% a product of colonialism and capitalism and imperialism. 100% But does that mean we have to deny the way their rich leaders have at times collaborated with these forces? Why? To stick with our ideology even when the material positions of the working class beg to be heard?
How much of the information the left believes about Venezuela comes from rich white people getting fully paid trips to selectively see the rich parts of the country? They come back home and declare they have found truth when in reality their class position has just been confirmed. It’s like when the Queen visits her colonies and certain roads are paved to reassure her that everything is hunky-dory. There is a willful ignorance here by all sides of the political spectrum that is continually justifying its own rule and the world’s inequality.
This can stretch to all leaders, and certainly to all people. Everyone should be put in the context of these forces of capitalism and colonialism or else the wrong conclusions will be drawn. Assad, Kim Jong-un, etc. Not much point in criticizing them unless one wants to excuse colonialism. At the same time there is a posture that remains blind to material conditions and ends up ignoring actions that are deeply harmful to working people. Putting these things in context may be important. But ultimately credibility is lost when there is straight denial. And this denial only fits in with the broader establishment that likes to focus on things like the stock market or unemployment numbers to justify their current neoliberal rule. And there is an identification with the strong man too that the left is vulnerable too. Primarily as a punch back against the soul crushing nature and powerless of capitalism, but still, something that should be avoided.
Thinking of the anti-war event in the Twin Cities here recently, events which I’ve been to as much as I can. And despite no one in these bitter hippy groups purchasing a razor for the last 20 years, the class violence leaked out when Venezuelan protesters came to protest a rich white lady fresh off the Maduro all expenses paid trip who was here to tell her fellow white people how great Venezuela was (for her). And when Venezuelans protested, they were shoved out. Given no voice. And hell maybe they were right wing. But this was the point where ideology simply failed in relation to material truth. The subaltern could not speak.
Now it is true that the media exaggerates the crisis on Venezuela. Although it may be more accurate to say it overemphasizes it. And they do this for financial reasons, which the left is largely free of, besides an occasional financial tie to state propaganda. But there is a crisis there. And if the left wants to seriously deal with the material conditions of the working class then it must begin by ending the denial of the material conditions of the working class. The left loses not only its moral credibility but its authenticity if this reality is avoided for ideological reasons.
That the root of all these problems are the 1% and the colonialist world order still in place from an economic perspective that really shrinks any real options for poor countries outside of capitalist growth. Chomsky sort of misses on that in his analysis of Latin America, which blames a reliance on the market while failing to examine on a deeper level while this policy is really the only allowance possible under colonialism, even if it is short lived. The left could be useful in providing an original analysis of this fact. Which the corporate media fails to do. Instead they focus on disputing liberals as a form of petty bourgeois bickering completely divorced from the reality on the ground.
Of course when talking about Venezuela and Latin America as a whole acknowledging the significant gains of the working class in recent history that came through robust social programs—that matters more than ever now. But that’s how it goes. The working class organizes, gains rights. The ruling class responds. And it’s a cycle, in recent history. But it does matter bow long one stays in each place and the severity of the cycle in both directions. True too that Venezuela was targeted because they were successful. But the lack of nuance here is just as concerning as the separation from the material.
This is not to say that socialism shouldn’t take center stage. It must now more than ever. It is however the same useful idiot dynamic that sets up the left every time a small piece of bait is thrown out. And ultimately the intellectual class does deserve its own death if this is the only analysis that can be given. One that is chiefly contained within its own meta-narrative and circulates around itself as if it is not the entire truth, but the entire realm of possibility, with many disagreements within this realm.
Which is actually similar to something Chomsky pointed to when discussing the role of media. That it animates a discussion within a narrow range, seemingly showing a diversity of opinion when in reality basically having the same objective—that is class rule. And maybe this is harsh to expand it to the very people who brought it up but then again to not do so would be avoiding a layering that is obvious.
There is a shrinking of the political imagination going on here. It’s more evident in the liberal press that singled out one country that in appearance or history at least looks like a break from the increasing privatization and austerity schemes that keep the world war-torn and poor. Without the colonialist lens to read the press through one can never get to the root of the problem. It is however a failing too to deny the real state of the working class in order to rebel against a certain posture by the liberal ruling class which is designed to elicit a response. And there is a paternal attitude on race here too that at once has a very idealistic view of race, almost to the liberal narrative like the happy servant The left version is certainly more militarized which is more liberating certainly but also just as racist when such behavior is accepted as a necessity or even a virtue of communities too dangerous for the speaker to genuinely admire, even if there is a certain revolutionary potential.
And here there becomes a blatant class violence that is capable of understanding the causes of suffering without being capable of taking any sort of democracy coming from the working class seriously because this democracy is seen as compromised by the very ruling class that is so self-critical. And there is a truth to this in an almost pure sense. But this doesn’t really do anything for anybody besides reaffirming the power differences.
So it must go on denouncing the assumed right of imperialism, which seems to be becoming such an assumed norm that there actually is more focus on the imperialism that doesn’t happen than the imperialism that does (see Africa, never known or the Middle East, which became almost immediately habitual, or even Latin America, without Trump, would be normal). Russia is protected by the left-right in the same way Europe is protected by the liberals. As an ideological utopia that if left to foster without interference, would bloom into a place far more pure than the multiethnic United States.
This is not to equate USA and Russia or deny the real imperialism on Russia either. It is more to frame the point of emphasis as a problem. The Israel substitute works here too. The human rights violations in Palestine do get both repeatedly denied like no other and to a far lesser extent repeatedly defended like no other. And both are a result of a cultural interest in the Jewish question, unfortunately, which remains as problematic as the Muslim question in academia. Both answers are more interested in the question more than the suffering, given the conditions of the poor in so many parts of the world. Palestine has reached the point of true disaster, and it has few comparisons in terms of devastation, but that is hardly the point for either side, even when both could use it.
This is why someone like Ilhan Omar gets all this coverage by the corporate press. Essentially her pro-Palestine argument, if it even exists, is unconvincing. The anti-Semitism, or at the potential for this framing, is the most glaring part. So she works as a useful idiot here, as does most of the isolated Israel criticism that can really only further the ruling class urge to frame these issues as anything other than class divisions and class consequences.
Now we agree on the problem in Palestine. It is in many ways far worse than even most leftists think. It is a reducing argument to bring Israel into the equation. It is the classic you know black on black crime scenario which sort of acts as an excuse for people to be politically incorrect about something they couldn’t actually believe in good conscious. People like to pretend like this is a more specific problem than it is and it becomes fashionable to blame the Jews. And many aren’t doing that knowingly. But it is a way of speaking past each other when Israel is used this way because it isn’t convincing for people. And this is because the Jewish question is inherently divisive while the rights of Palestinians can’t be. Unfortunately the consensus seems to go the other way: that Palestinians aren’t as important as that intriguing Jewish question. But, yeah, it’s not divisive.
This was where it became clear that for the ruling class ideology takes the place of class interest. Firstly because it is more interesting. And secondly because there is no conscionable way to take the side of the ruling class. It is in this way that the subaltern can never be understood by those trying to explain her.
This naturally brings up the question: who is allowed to speak in our society? Spivak is necessary here. Following the logic that the politics of today is simply art in the context of this mass media spectacle and rigid class distinction. Applying Spivak then means giving no more credit to the left who can read than the rest who can’t: “Reading literature “well” is in itself a questionable good and can indeed be sometimes a productive of harm and “aesthetic” apathy within its ideological framing.” If politics is reduced to this framework then it means zero victories laps when one can see suffering. If one has to ‘read’ suffering and be vindicated when they can see it is then that we see that this only makes the subject itself elite enough not to be touched by it.
Spivak reads the intellectual well: “I have tried to argue that the substantive concern for the politics of the oppressed which often accounts for Foucault’s appeal can hide a privileging of the intellectual and of the ‘concrete’ subject of oppression that, in fact, compound the appeal.” The oppressed are art. They either are disposed of entirely or played with by those who aren’t oppressed as a means to justify this state or even to entertain. Here truth only appears as the aesthetic. Morality is used as a weapon against other elitist opponents and therefore loses all credibility and is repeated so often in this 24/7 media cycle that it dulls and loses all (intellectual) credibility along the way, although there will always be material credibility for the media as long as they remain this rich—and that is by material definition.
It is here where the left’s alarmism of “death of the media” reads just like the false warnings of nuclear war if Trump was impeached. The left will frame Russiagate as the death of the media. This is wishful thinking as the left hopes to rise in its place. In reality the media will continue how it has been. For most people as a sort of catharsis against the automation and anxiety of life on the one hand, while a complete terrorizing force on the other. And for those ‘close readers’ educated enough to read the whole thing as a scam the media will continue to act as a truth-teller. Not that the close readers believe the media. It is more that they believe the media to be important precisely because it comes from the same class that the alternative left and right does and therefore there is a need to discredit it if only to assert its significance where there is little.
There is an equivalence here, if not a total substitution of the role of dispossessed. And this is an important distinction when we live in a country that leads the worst human rights violations in the world, whether you want to count prisons or wars. And in many ways the treatment of the homeless and the poor is unparalleled when one considers the wealth in this country of both the upper middle class and the very rich.
With Trump and his base there is an obvious contradiction, which they may only sense, or at least they think is justified. It is that this expression of victimhood is believed and is, at least superficially (semantically?) accounted for. This in one sense invalidates their posture but certainly given the real state of the working class, will always have some truth to it even if it comes to dishonest conclusions.
We then have a certain dynamic that only considers those who can speak. Freedom of speech puts the buggy before the horse as the first amendment of this country. We have a type of debate that really never reaches beyond itself. And remains self-critical only for the purpose of self-correction, which if done in any sort of fundamental way would eliminate the very process at hand, and therefore this process ceases to be enough.
Now let’s take most literature, most film, most anything produced by those with leisure, those who can afford to take risks, and those who certainly had some sort of access to education, whether that be formal or informal. Note how much the ruling class likes to celebrate dropouts like Steve Jobs, who really actually was a complete failure in all senses besides making money, which is at least, when school is celebrated by the rich, the only point in it. And for most poor people, this is the primary goal, if they can even afford to get quality schooling in the first place.
But back to the point at hand. There is a self-diagnosis which is followed by a class disavowal that is rather useless, if not out right dishonest. Take Russiagate, as the form of concentrated expression of a larger trend. Now you have a juxtaposition here that is downright odd, and if it weren’t running the world, would be completely irrelevant, even if interesting to those in the midst of it.
On the one hand there is an idealism, which can be, to a point, admired. But this more reflects an innocence than anything else. Now we have a class of people, basically rich and white and culturally Christian and Western who are seeing that yes, the world is run by basically a bunch of reactionary savages who have no regard for human suffering at all. This becomes upon first discovery either a paralyzing horror or an intellectual artifact, depending chiefly on one’s relation to the suffering imposed. What Chomsky called the 20%, who are always the subject, are these people. And it is true that there is a squeeze on here. It’s a squeeze by the ruling class, that doesn’t allow for any mercy anymore, completely irrational and unhinged. Climate change appears to guarantee this inequality until the end of our days. Although an optimist one must be, at least to get through the day.
Now, there becomes an error in judgment here. Not so much because the conditions of the self are not seen clearly. If there is one thing the middle class can do, it is see itself. But the relativity remains. And this privileging of people categorically has not changed, if anything it only cements as the squeeze is put on.
There is a desperate attempt, which no doubt comes from a sincere place, to become the victim, to fit in with the news cycle or something. Or alternatively there is a feeling as if you aren’t being heard, and that you are entitled to be heard. Which of course you should feel. But that doesn’t erase the contradiction.
There also is a clear material reality that victories for anyone besides the 1% are few and far between and that it is only through this exterior identification that anything can be achieved or even said. Hillary Clinton victory being a symbol of victory for women, for example. Never mind that she’s just as miserable as the rest of us.
This obviously is a mistake. To identify with the ruling class as if their victories are yours. But it also should be easy to have compassion for this position and pity for anyone who takes it. Donald Trump reads a crowd well. And he does this well because he is extremely self-conscious. He needs their approval but he also sincerely shares that feeling that he has been wronged. As a trade-off for organization, servitude, if not humiliation is accepted.
Onto Russiagate, which remains primarily, if not wholly a display of theatre. It therefore is an act of art and entertainment for anyone who takes anything from it. For Trump and his base, the script was a triumphant one, but so was the trial itself because it gave these people the coveted space of victimhood, which could explain away all their failures, real or imagined. For liberals this was a homage to their shock. Unable to accept Trump, physical removal needed to be a hope, newly printed every day in only slightly different language.
Still, one has to find the left critique of Russiagate to be just as obsessive and imaginary and classist as the liberal embrace of it. There is that awful positioning of the self as the lead in the tragedy. This is for entertainment purposes, and even more so for psychological ones. Pan to big Pharma. Trump as a Russian agent? Hot air. Russiagate as the founder of Cold War? Hot air. Putin as the grand master? Hot air. Russiagate as the new McCarthyism? Hot air.
There are remarkable parallels though to these dual states of delusion. There is, in a time of great peril, some need to turn the spotlight on one’s self and yell look at me! The only reason this goes anywhere, if it even does, is because you own the spotlight. Trump does this too of course. Witch hunt he says. If it was a witch hunt, he’d be in real trouble. But that would end the story.
None of this hardly matters, as it has been stated before. It may interest the reader (and the writer) because it is, in its own way, self-reflective, if not self-obsessed. And it doesn’t matter. Partly because the ruling class is useless to changing society for the good. Always has been. Partly because no one cares. And this is why the left critique of Russiagate falls flat.
In reality the problem may be far worse, although certainly better than the Orwellian fantasies. The reality is that the primary politics is survival. Any looming threat, whether that be Russia itself (liberals) or Cold War (leftists) is completely divorced from class until it actually reaches beyond an intellectual debate about the ruling class itself.
There is something about Trump and most other fascist leaders. There is this air of newness, as if they are seeing the world for the first time and becoming disgusted by it. This naturally involves movement, which makes them effective politicians. Not movement in the sense of organization, but movement as in motion. Trump takes the viewer to a new world. Sure it’s made up. But it is new and it is not entirely stagnant.
The obvious silencer of plot is death. And to many living under Trump and capitalism, this is it. A sobering, but fairly evident point. But there also is a certain end to the plot in all jobs, all money problems, all health impairments, all prison sentences, many marriages or pregnancies. A smothering of desire. Perhaps before it is even formulated. At a young age many times too, given hunger and poverty for children today. Which then can make desire its own predator.
And so, despite the individualization of neoliberalism, or probably because of it, the self soon has to channel the paths available to it. Rarely is there any room for material gains in this system, and even when found, seem elusive, has the subject has lost themselves, and more importantly, everybody else along the way.
There are no longer the institutions necessarily for a democratic society either. No after school programs, no unions, no public spaces at all. Not that there aren’t advantages to this. And certain freedoms gained from it. But it is in the interests of the ruling class, to have this division and loneliness.
It is in these conditions, puny paycheck to puny paycheck and without agency or room for triviality that we find the world today. And most of all an insecurity and temporary nature of things that causes anxiety and stress. Many times working many jobs. Or in other parts of the world, no jobs, or jobs for wages that only pay for gas.
It is here where the news manufactured to Chomsky’s 20% can only be shocking and never accepted. Now perhaps this is an optimistic view. But more likely it will never be accepted simply because it erases any merit to life at all when to this middle class there is merit, even in performative pessimism. Now there has to be a point to that there remains a profound misunderstanding between us all. And to speculate on anything beyond the material conditions remains an impossibility, although many will try. But any donate to a hungry child in blank line comes with a set of assumptions that reflects the giver more than the receiver, who has no say in the matter anyways. Therefore you can learn a whole lot about rich people from their charity organizations, but you will never find the answers they are looking for. Nor should they be looking for them, if they believe anything they think.
There is a fork in the road here, which naturally means hope and uncertainty, and even potential doom, no matter which way the wind blows. There is a split in what could be broadly defined as populism. Whether that is one that identifies with the self or with the oppressor, or in the case of well to do liberal left, a mixture of both.
Here we really do have trouble in the waters on both the well to do populist left and right, will identify with Trump’s persecution and his so-called dragon energy as a sort of punching down in the face of shrinking realities. Intellectually, distinctions can be made. But who could deny that the energy is on the side of the fascists in these circles?
There is a dismissal of populist desire as elitism, whether that be for clean water or even for a ruling class ploy like McDoanld’s or Russiagate or anything else that is systematically deployed. The sort of distancing to the point of disgust reads, and even applies practically, as something left wing. But it also reveals a very real difference which is the matter of choice. A choice to be an activist for the underclass is not the same as being in the underclass itself, which may find little rewarding about that condition, and are likely never asked.
This is all an argument to bring the world back to a material place. Not to erase art, but to expand its miserable consumer base. Materially, the world would be better without Trump. Whether or not that fits with an ideal matters. But only to those whose main mode of life is in fact idealism. This is naturally a class distinction and therefore it is with some irony that we find that poisoned water, not the purging of the intellectual class, will be the main failure of Russiagate. Watching Trump dismantle both at once leads one to assert that these things are not entirely separate issues and even though the only interest of the ruling class is self-examination, there should remain a place for this.
Russiagate then was not so much a distraction as it was leisure for those lucky enough to have it. As long as the left enjoyed themselves, who could fault this? It is, by definition of the somewhat cryptic ideology necessary to the definition of the left that we say it is a shame more people can’t imagine their own persecution and suffering and instead remain in a state where this is their material reality. Life then is merely a joke, but we should be asking if it is funny enough to justify what we do to achieve it.
The fantasy of nuclear war via Russia applies as the equalizer by annihilation. Now instead of the systematic dismantling of the working class we have shared suffering, if only potential, which is really the only way these classes can share anything. Focusing on it ignores the real hierarchies created by the ruling class as they systematically cleanse the population. History is used in a way not so different from the Trump style of disregarding it altogether. Rather we see a need to assert the same nostalgia for communism, when it has been killed, for leftism, when it has been squashed, and even for nuclear war, when it has taken a back seat to the reactionary race-baiting, women groping and poor bashing of Trump and company.
Therefore, it is with some relief that one can they are no longer a leftist. Ideology can and has failed the working class. Every ideology believes it helps somebody but it forgets about everything but itself along the way. Class comes first and it is only afterward that we come up with a politics that explains it.

The Media Smoothed the Path to British Soldiers Using Corbyn as Target Practice,www.therussophile.org,Jonathan Cook,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-media-smoothed-the-path-to-british-soldiers-using-corbyn-as-target-practice.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Drawing by Nathaniel St. Clair
It is time to stop believing these infantile narratives the British political and media establishments have crafted for us. Like the one in which they tell us they care deeply about the state of political life, and that they lie awake at night worrying about the threat posed by populism to our democratic institutions.
How do they persuade us of the depth of their concern? They express their horror at at the murder of an MP, Jo Cox, and their outrage at the abuse of another, Anna Soubry – both victims of the frenzied passions unleashed by Brexit.
But the political and media elites don’t really care whether politicians are assaulted, vilified or threatened – at least, not if it is the kind of politician who threatens their power. They aren’t seriously worried about attacks on democracy, or about political violence, or about the rottenness at the core of state institutions. Their outrage is selective. It is rooted not in principle, but in self-interest.
Is that too cynical? Ponder this.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hasn’t faced just shouted insults from afar, like Soubry. He was recently physically assaulted, hit on the head by a man holding an egg in his fist. But unlike Soubry, our media expressed no real concern. In fact, they could barely hide their sniggers at his “ egging ”, an attack they presented as little more than a prank. They even hinted that Corbyn deserved it.
‘Kill vampire Jezza’
The media have been only happy too to vilify Corbyn as a Kremlin stooge and a former Soviet spy. Senior Tory Iain Duncan Smith this week called Corbyn “a Marxist whose sole purpose in life is to do real damage to the country” – a remark that, as ever went, entirely unchallenged by the BBC interviewer giving him a platform. Just imagine a Labour MP being allowed to accuse Theresa May of being a fascist whose only goal is to destroy the country.
But the BBC has never bothered to conceal its intense dislike of Corbyn. Its news shows have even photoshopped the Labour leader to make him look “Russian” – or “more Russian”, as the BBC and the rest of the media mischievously phrased it. Those who protested were told they were reading too much into it. They needed to lighten up and not take themselves so seriously.
Senior Conservatives, including the former defence secretary Michael Fallon, have regularly portrayed Corbyn as a threat to national security, especially over concerns about the Trident nuclear missile system. Many senior members of Corbyn’s own party have echoed such smears – all amplified, of course, by the media.
Those who suggested that the government and media needed to engage with Corbyn’s well-grounded doubts about the safety of nuclear weapons, or the economics and practicalities of the Trident programme, were derided – like Corbyn – as “pacifists” and “traitors”.
And the mood music to these political clashes was the quite literal demonisation of Corbyn by the red-top dailies. Most famously, the Daily Mail photoshopped him as Dracula, above the headline: “Labour must KILL vampire Jezza.”
Degraded political culture
Then Corbyn became the target of another sustained smear campaign. It was claimed that this lifelong, very public anti-racism activist – who over decades had forged strong ties to sections of the British Jewish community, despite being a steadfast critic of Israel – was a secret anti-semite, or at best providing succour to anti-semites as they overran the Labour party.
Was there any factual basis or evidence for these claims? No. But the British public was assured by rightwing Jews like the Board of Deputies and by “leftwing” Jewish supporters of Israel like Jonathan Freedland that evidence wasn’t necessary, that they had a sixth sense for these things.
Corbyn’s supporters were told that they should not question the wildly inflammatory and evidence-free denunciations of Corbyn and the wider Labour membership for a supposed “institutional anti-semitism” – and, with a satisfyingly circular logic, that to do so was itself proof of anti-semitism.
The weaponisation of anti-semitism through political spin by Corbyn’s political enemies, including the Blairite faction of the parliamentary Labour party, was and is a dangerous assault on public life, one that has very obviously degraded Britain’s political culture.
Too toxic to lead Labour
The smear was meant to override the membership’s wishes and make Corbyn too toxic to lead Labour.
It has also politicised the anti-semitism allegation, weakening it for a section of the population, and irresponsibly inflaming fears among other sections. It has deflected attention from the very real threat of a rising tide of rightwing racism, both Islamophobia and the kind of anti-semitism that relates to Jews, not Israel.
Then, there was the serving British general who was given a platform by the Sunday Times – anonymously, of course – to accuse Corbyn of being a threat to Britain’s security. The general warned that the army’s senior command would never allow Corbyn near Number 10. They would launch a coup first.
But no one in the corporate media or the political establishment thought the interview worthy of much attention, or demanded an investigation to find out which general had threatened to overturn the democratic will of the people. The story was quickly dropped down the memory hole. Those who sought to draw attention to it were told to move on, that there was nothing to see.
And now, this week, footage has emerged showing British soldiers – apparently taking their commanders’ expressed wishes more seriously than the media – using a poster of Corbyn as target practice out in Afghanistan.
Questioning ‘security credentials’
Do the media and politicians really care about any of this? Are they concerned, let alone as outraged as they were at Soubry’s earlier discomfort at the verbal abuse she faced? Do they understand the seriousness of this threat to British political life, to the safety of the leader of the opposition, they themselves have stoked?
The signs are still far from reassuring. Theresa May did not think it worth using prime minister’s questions to condemn the video, to send an unequivocal message that Britain’s political choices would never be decided by violence. No one else in the chamber apparently thought to raise the matter either.
Sky News even used the footage to question yet again Corbyn’s “security credentials”, as though the soldiers might thereby have grounds for treating him as a legitimate target.
The clues as to where all this is leading are not hard to fathom. The white nationalist who drove into a crowd outside Finsbury Park mosque in London in 2017, killing a worshipper, admitted at his trial that the real target had been Corbyn. An unexpected roadblock foiled his plans.
The fact is that no one in the political or media class cares much whether their constant trivialising of Corbyn’s political programme degrades British political life, or whether their smears could lead to political violence, or whether four years of their incitement might encourage someone to use more than an egg and a fist against Corbyn.
So let’s stop indulging the media and politicians as they cite Jo Cox’s murder and Anna Soubry’s intimidation as evidence of their democratic sensibilities and their commitment to political principle.
The truth is they are charlatans. They will use anything – from the murder of an MP to confections of anti-semitism and smears about treason – to incite against a democratic politician who threatens their domination of the political system.
It is their refusal to engage with a political argument they know they will lose, and to allow a democratic process to take place that they fear will produce the wrong result, that is setting the scene for greater polarisation and frustration. And ultimately for more violence.

NATO Interrupted,www.therussophile.org,David Swanson,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/nato-interrupted.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Wednesday morning an event was held in a building overlooking Freedom Plaza in Washington, D.C., at an organization called the Center for European Policy Analysis, which is funded by : FireEye, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Bell Helicopters, BAE systems, the U.S. State Department, the Pentagon, National Endowment for Democracy, the U.S. Mission to NATO, and NATO’s own Public Diplomacy Division.
Participating in the event were several foreign ministers from NATO nations, ambassadors to NATO, and U.S. Senator Chris Murphy. NATO is designed to vigilantly protect you from numerous imaginary and NATO-provoked dangers, but its events are apparently protected by magic spells, as I just walked in and took a seat.
When I couldn’t take any more of the pro-militarism talk, I stood up and interrupted, holding up a sign reading: “Yes to Peace / NoToNATO.org.” Lots of media cameras were in the room, so there is bound to be video somewhere. (Please share it with me.) I said words to this general effect:
NATO needs to be shut down, not enlarged. Russia spends a tiny percentage of what NATO nations do on war, and you pretend to be afraid of Russia. We’re not buying it. You’re provoking dangers. NATO makes up 3/4 of military spending in the world. Its members are also responsible for about 3/4 of foreign weapons dealing — to dictatorships and so-called democracies around the world. NATO wages aggressive wars far from the North Atlantic. The people you can hear chanting outside have had enough. We’re not believing these myths anymore.
I continued along those lines for a little while before leaving. We sang songs and spoke to people in the building’s lobby and on the sidewalk out front, and did interviews with media from every continent other than North America, before heading off to Capitol Hill where the head of NATO was being welcomed in bipartisan harmony.
NATO is encountering protest everywhere it goes in Washington on Wednesday and will on Thursday as well. Detailed plans are at http://notonato.org

An “Inconvenient Truth” that Al Gore Missed,www.therussophile.org,Michael Eisenscher,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/an-inconvenient-truth-that-al-gore-missed.html/,"This post was originally published on this site In a recent interview with The Real News , actor and activist John Cusack made a simple but profoundly important point: “[Y]ou can’t separate climate justice and militarism’, he said,”… because the drones are going to follow the fresh water, and the soldiers are going to protect the oil, and then if things go on as they are, game over for the planet.” There is ‘an inconvenient truth’ that didn’t make it into the 2006 documentary by that name featuring Al Gore. It is something rarely mentioned by most environmental and social justice activists and their organizations. Most labor leaders who seek a just transition to a sustainable energy system that does not make workers with fossil fuel-dependent jobs bare the social cost also remain silent. The truth is that preventing climate change from inflicting cataclysmic damage to our ecosystem and threatening much of life on earth and civilization as we know it cannot be accomplished unless we also demilitarize our foreign policy, end interventionist wars and break the grip that both Big Carbon and the military-industrial complex have on our federal budget, foreign policy, economy and government. Peace is a climate goal because it is a climate necessity War is an environmental nightmare that pollutes and contaminates every place it is fought, while contributing substantially to the carbon load of the planet. The US military is the single largest consumer of fossil fuels on the planet and its single largest greenhouse gas polluter. War and climate change-caused disasters are the principal drivers of global migration and the refugee crisis. The physical, social and financial impacts of war are felt for generations. War, preparation for war and its aftermath drain resources from investment in renewable energy. It limits our ability to protect our most vulnerable frontline communities and mitigate the worst effects of climate change. Military spending consumes funds needed to meet other critical economic and social needs — healthcare, education, infrastructure, energy efficiency and more. The costs of war continue long after the fighting ends in the ongoing care required by veterans, the social costs of addiction, depression and other manifestations of PTSD, and interest paid to service the debt that accrues when wars are fought on the government’s credit card. Our military’s primary function is to defend whatever the president as commander-in-chief determines is in America’s ‘national security’ or ‘vital US interests’. George Bush sent tens of thousands of troops to invade Iraq in 2003 without provocation and in contravention of international law, in the name of ‘national security’. But in reality, the concepts of ‘national security’ and ‘vital interests’ are more often than not euphemisms for protecting and defending corporate and investor interests, preeminent among which are the interests of fossil fuel energy conglomerates and the military-industrial complex — or more simply to make the world safe for the exploitation of and trade in fossil fuel and other natural resources while boosting profits of military contractors. To do that it has to assert military superiority and global hegemony to discourage, and discourage or defeat, any competitor or adversary, whether real, potential, contrived or imagined. The US military serves as global enforcer for fossil fuel interests. It’s collaborator in that effort is the military-industrial complex, which maintains a codependent and inextricably interwoven relationship with Big Carbon. Neither can survive without the other. The US military has been continuously at war for more than 17 years at a cost of over five trillion dollars , and has been engaged in some form of armed conflict or military intervention on average every six months since World War II. Its global reach is provided by more than 1.3 million men and women under arms stationed on 800 foreign bases in 80 nations, reinforced by 20 aircraft carriers; 66 submarines; 329 other naval craft; 3,700 fighter jets, bombers and attack aircraft; 44,700 tanks and armored fighting vehicles; 6,550 nuclear warheads , and 800 inter-continental ballistic missiles — a military might unmatched by any other country in the world . The US has deployed Special Forces to 150 countries — more than three-quarters of all the nations in the world * — in service to what the AFL-CIO General Executive Council in 2011 aptly described as a “militarized foreign policy.” The US fits the classic definition of a ‘ garrison state’ . In order to fulfill this role, the US military and military contractors consume nearly two-thirds of the entire US discretionary budget , costing taxpayers $1.25 trillion a year when the Pentagon base budget, war spending, nuclear arms, veterans benefits and future care, interest paid on funds borrowed to finance past wars, and other national security-related expenses of government are added up. The US military budget is greater than the next seven nations combined — roughly double what China, Russia, Iran and North Korea together spend — far more than is required to defend our country’s borders and its people. As we abandon fossil fuels, a just transition to a sustainable energy society requires that we defend immigrant families, protect and meet the needs of frontline communities, assure the welfare of displaced workers in both fossil fuel-dependent and military-industrial jobs, and support military personnel impacted by an end to our aggressive foreign policy. Just as fossil fuel and military-industrial interests are interwoven and interdependent, so too are environmental, social justice and labor causes, The labor, environmental justice and peace movements must abandon issue and organizational silos to begin operating as a single multi-faceted progressive movement that understands their interdependence and consciously develops collaboration, mutual support and solidarity between them. What compels these different strands of progressive struggle to weave a new progressive tapestry is recognition that none of these movements can achieve their objectives without achieving the objectives of the others. We will not be able to successfully decarbonize our economy if we do not also demilitarize US foreign policy. Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. understood this when he declared one year prior to his death: “We as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. . . . When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered.” His admonition has been echoed more recently by the Poor People’s Campaign . We need a new definition of national security We need a new definition of national security based on what the American people, not multinational corporations and the investor class need to be secure — not based on the size of our military, the number of our foreign military bases, the power of our weapons or the advanced state of our military technology but on the strength of our shared values and the needs and aspirations of the American people. Real national security should protect our people, not the profits of multinational corporations. · Real national security exists when people have jobs with incomes sufficient to provide a decent standard of living, affordable housing and healthcare, education without a lifetime of student debt, and safe, affordable child and elder care. · Real national security provides efficient affordable mass transit, modern safe public infrastructure, a proper social safety net, sustainable carbon-free energy, protection of our environment, and wholesome food. · Real national security can only be achieved if all countries dramatically reduce their consumption of fossil fuels, lower the threat posed by runaway global warming, and eliminate all nuclear weapons. · Real national security requires our country operate in the world as a member of a global community of nations so as to earn respect rather than to instill fear. · Real national security requires respect for international law, human rights, the rights of refugees, the Bill of Rights of the US Constitution, and work to end xenophobia, nativism, racism, misogyny, homophobia and transphobia. · Real national security can be achieved only if the conditions of poverty, unemployment, alienation and despair which provide the fertile field in which terrorism grows are alleviated throughout the world — when the fate of the least of us is tied to the fate of the rest of us as members of a single global human community. That is why we must rise together for climate, jobs, justice and peace .

Iraq’s WMDs Found…In Russia,www.therussophile.org,Rob Urie,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/iraqs-wmds-foundin-russia.html/,"This post was originally published on this site White House photo by Eric Draper
In late 2017, actor Morgan Freeman announced in a video created by a who’s who of senior U.S. Intelligence officials that Russia had attacked the United States and that ‘we’ were at war. Freeman, whose net worth is said to be about a quarter-billion dollars , claimed that ex-Soviet ‘authoritarian’ Vladimir Putin, bitter about the dissolution of ‘his’ country, was behind the attack. The terms ‘attack’ and ‘war’ were not qualified as metaphors.
The crudeness of the appeal— provoking naked fear of invading hordes of godless communists led by an evil dictator, had a retro quality that undid thirty years of technocratic upgrading of American agitprop Where is the Reagan-era Patrick Swayze packing a grenade launcher when you need him? Or going back a bit further in agitprop history, where is Kevin McCarthy with a panicked warning about your neighbors going to sleep as good Americans and waking up as communists stooges of the Kremlin?
Within weeks of Donald Trump’s electoral victory the ‘true American’ press, in the form of the Washington Post, revealed that it had a list of known communists who had infiltrated the U.S. government political websites that were acting as witting or unwitting agents of the Kremlin, current company included. One could be forgiven for imagining that the ‘authoritarian’ Donald Trump was behind the smear. But no— it appears to have been Ukrainian ‘patriots’ with ties to both the Democratic Party leadership and actual European Nazis that struck this blow for freedom.
Freedom through censorship might seem an odd construct until it is understood that Kremlin agents are everywhere. By 2017, my friends from New York were suddenly afraid to venture out of Manhattan for fear of encountering a ‘Trump voter.’ (This is true). Never mind that a half-century of neoliberal predation had left the economy a shadow of its former self, the only possible explanation for Trump! was Russian subversion of our electoral process. That the U.S. ranks low in terms of free and fair elections has nothing to do with ‘Russian interference.’
The inclusion of Mr. Freeman as a modern-day Minuteman signaled that the target audience for the video wasn’t marginally literate ‘deplorables’ swilling beer in their underwear as they watched Dancing with the Stars, but rather the people who spend their days in offices or on airplanes. Because they wear suits, these good people must be smart and sophisticated, not the ‘low information’ voters who see a picture of an eagle in front of a waving flag and nod their heads approvingly with whatever nonsense follows (irony alert).
At the height of George W. Bush’s war against Iraq, there wasn’t a trading floor on Wall Street where CNN or Fox News wasn’t blaring 24/7 that WMDs had been found in Iraq. Better a million dead Iraqis over there than a mushroom souffle for lunch over here. Those who remember ‘Poppy’s war,’ Gulf War I that buried tens of thousands of Iraqi conscripts alive in the desert after Iraq had surrendered, may remember that it was also Wall Street that hosted the ticker tape parade that followed that glorious victory.
Any of the intelligence officials associated with the Morgan Freeman video could have acted in it as competently as Mr. Freeman. Most had spent more than a bit of face time lying under oath to congress. But no mention was made of the fact that they were behind the video. Mr. Freeman, wearing casual clothes with the hipster single earing in each ear, was the face of ‘the people’ rising in righteous anger at the afront to ‘our democracy.’ That no one had died in ‘the attack’ likely made the video the least lethal project these intelligence officials had participated in in their adult lives.
A few Democrats and ‘the left’ had remained outside of the George W. Bush administration’s propaganda effort in the run up to the Iraq war. The demonstrations held before the war began were the largest in history. In contrast, the people who found the administration’s argument for war compelling were liberal hawks amongst the urban bourgeois and the people who fought it. The overlap between these two groups n’existe pas. And it was the latter who brought back stories of the clusterfuck quality of the war to its liberal proponents comfortably ensconced in their armchairs of freedom.
That propaganda effort was politics 101, divide and conquer. As Mr. Bush put it, you’re either with us or you’re with the terrorists. That 9/11 was 1) both a rational response to American foreign policy in the Middle East and 2) planned and financed by business associates of the Bush family , would seem to muddy the waters of binary divisions. Following, as Mr. Freeman put it, you’re either with us, or you’re with Putin. Never mind the business interests that tied the intelligence agencies to U.S. based energy companies competing with Russia to supply Europe with oil and gas.
The glorious victory of freedom over tyranny that was the Obama administration led coup in Ukraine was never over anything as base as material interests. That Democratic Party wunderkind and 2020 presidential aspirant Joe Biden was cobbled to neocon warlordess Victoria Nuland in the months preceding it, and Joe’s son Hunter joined Ukrainian oil and gas patriots to slay the Russian bear soon thereafter, is what the gods call serendipity. That Russia stepped in to protect its Black Sea naval base at Sevastopol , Crimea proves its treachery.
One might have imagined that the historical break that Mr. Trump’s election represented, as put forward by the Democratic operatives who lost the election, would speak for itself. Of course, racism, sexism and misogyny have no place in American history— just watch Mr. Freeman’s / the U.S. intelligence agency’s video for a clear recounting of the unalloyed virtues of American democracy . When Israeli strongman freedom fighter Benjamin Netanyahu gave the U.S. Congress instructions for future U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East in 2015, the word ‘collusion’ wasn’t mentioned even once in New York Times reporting on the event.
The first round of Mueller indictments against Russian internet advertising firms produced charges that stood little chance of being contested. An analogy is to indict figures from history, say Plato or the Marquis de Sade who, because they are dead, pose little risk of asking for the evidence against them. But surprise! Concord Management, one of the firms charged by Mueller, responded with counsel seeking discovery. Mr. Mueller used a procedural move to preclude handing his evidence over to actual lawyers. Lonely are the brave.
The Hamilton 68 ‘Russian interference’ tracking website turns out to be affiliated with the German Marshall Fund which itself is filled with ex-Obama administration officials with ties to the National Security Council. The German Marshall Funds runs the Alliance for Securing Democracy , a neo-con think tank that includes John Podesta, Bill Clinton’s Chief of Staff and chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential bid. The U.S. State Department and NATO are major contributors to the German Marshall Fund.
Of course, everyone knows that these coalitions of Democratic Party insiders and intelligence agency officials are behind most of the ‘Russian interference’ hysteria because the New York Times and Washington Post put them front and center as their sources, right? Surely no reputable newspaper would give front page coverage to unproven allegations made by political operatives working against the Party and personages currently in power, right? Doing so could be perceived as taking sides in an internecine political battle to undo the democratic will of at least a bit more than a quarter of eligible voters.
It was John Podesta’s emails that were alleged to have been hacked and released to news agencies during the 2016 campaign that would have deeply embarrassed Clinton campaign officials if they were capable of embarrassment. Yes, this is the very same John Podesta that ‘advises’ several of the groups cited by the New York Times and Washington Post as sources for stories about who hacked someone named John Podesta’s emails. Of course, everyone knows that ‘ hacked’ is a euphemism for ‘leaked .’
Why Democratic strategists preferred Morgan Freeman as the face of righteous outrage, rather than John Podesta’s brother Tony , is a mystery for the ages. Brother Tony, who was set to be charged with former Trump something-or-other Paul Manafort with colluption, a newfangled amalgam of collusion and corruption, decided that omerta is for suckers . Brother Tony squealed to Robert Mueller, decidedly complicating circumstances for Mr. Manafort, if making Brother Tony laud-worthy amongst his fellow Democratic Party lobbyists.
Of course, the intelligence-Democrats’ insight that Morgan Freeman is a better front-man than omerta-lite Brother Tony, or any of the other sixty-something pallid white guys in suits who have spent their careers making life miserable for something called ‘humanity,’ proves they are anti-racist, right? It is universally known that Bob Mueller loves both Muslims and immigrants so much that he rounded up and threw a thousand of them in jail without charges following 9/11 to protect them from being not in jail. He has that much heart.
Likewise, the CIA has long been known for promoting black and brown people— from the material to the ethereal plane. Responding to earlier red menace incursions, CIA ‘advisors’ sent four million Vietnamese, Laotians and Cambodians to what Christians speculate is a better place. Later, in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua the CIA provided free education through the School of the Americas to peasant-scholars in how to be tortured to death with dignity. Tens, if not hundreds, of thousands graduated and went on to decompose with dignity.
The NSA heroes who keep us safe from authoritarian creeps who would otherwise skirt the law to create illegal spy programs to gather and keep information on people suspected of no crime in direct contravention of the U.S. Constitution and existing law and then repeatedly lie about doing so under oath to congress certainly deserve the trust of the American people. If they say that Pump (Putin + Trump) represents an existential threat to our freedom, then let them shut down the opposition press, arrest anyone they think might be inconvenient to American business interests and unseat a leader that a lot of people voted for. As the saying goes, freedom ain’t free.
Support for increasing the power of the FBI, CIA and NSA and local and regional police departments while Donald Trump has been in office has been bi-partisan. If the national Democrats believed a word of their bullshit that Mr. Trump is a foreign agent, they would be, in the parlance, ‘traitors’ to give him more power. By the time that ‘high information voters’ figure out that they’ve been had, it will be on to the next diversion. Reportedly, about the same proportion of the population still believes the collusion story as believes that WMDs were found in Iraq.
Here’s the punchline— even if you believe the worst accusations of Russian interference in U.S. elections, they are orders of magnitude lower than the influence of American oligarchs and the state of Israel. If the Democrats want Donald Trump out, they should run someone that people will vote for. I would try to bring in some of the nearly half of the electorate that is eligible to vote but that doesn’t. Calling them deplorable seems a weak strategy for getting them to vote for you. In fact, it seems remarkably like Donald Trump’s disparagement of immigrants. But as a card-carrying puppet of the Kremlin, what do I know?

ROSTOV-ON-DON, April 5. /TASS/. The personnel of Buk-M1-2 surface-to-air missile batteries successfully accomplished assignments in interaction with teams of Pantsyr-S1 air defense missile/gun systems to thwart a massive enemy air attack in drills on the Black Sea coast of the Krasnodar Region, the press office of Russia’s Southern Military District reported on Friday.
“In the process of accomplishing combat training missions, the anti-aircraft gunners timely spotted, locked on and destroyed over 20 air targets by electronic launches when the targets entered the systems’ long-range destruction capability boundary,” the press office said.
Meanwhile, the teams of Pantsyr-S1 surface-to-air missile/gun complexes attached to Buk batteries accomplished assignments for defending military facilities against low-flying aircraft, including drones.
The one-day drills held on the Black Sea coast of the Krasnodar Region involved over 500 anti-aircraft gunners and more than 40 weapon systems.

Riga mayor vows to fight dismissal in court,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/riga-mayor-vows-to-fight-dismissal-in-court.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
RIGA, April 5. /TASS/. Nils Usakovs, the sacked Chairman of the Riga City Council, blasted the decision to sack him as unlawful and unprofessional, adding that he will appeal it in court.
“The first thing we see is that those who lost the 2017 Riga City Council elections are now trying to get revenge,” he said in an interview with the LTN television channel. “This decision is utterly unlawful and unprofessional.”
Usakovs vowed to fight this decision in court by filing an appeal.
“It is crystal clear that I will take this to court and I am quite certain that all the illegal misconduct that the Minister [for Environmental Protection and Regional Development Juris Puce] has committed by signing this decree will be proven in court,” Usakovs pointed out.
According to the politician, Vice Mayor Oleg Burov will act as the Mayor starting this Friday. Riga Mayor’s dismissal
On Friday, Latvia’s official publisher Latvijas Vestnesis published a decree signed by Minister for Environmental Protection and Regional Development Juris Puce ordering the dismissal of Riga Mayor Nils Usakovs. The decree listed all the violations that Usakovs committed as mayor, which mainly relate to the cooperation between the city and the Rigas Satiksme transportation company and state that there were inconsistencies in a report on the authorized capital of the Riga transportation enterprise and budget injections into it. As the decree stipulates, Nils Usakovs as the Riga Mayor and a Rigas Satiksme shareholder is fully responsible for all the discrepancies in the reports, it also states that the decision can be appealed within 30 days of its publication.
On January 30, the Latvian Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau searched the Riga mayor’s office and residence as part of a criminal investigation of the Rigas Satiksme transportation company that has been mired in a corruption scandal since the end of 2018. Usakovs said that he hadn’t committed any crime or criminal offences. According to him, no investigation was launched against him and no suspicions were put forward. Latvian nationalists demanded that he resign, however, the politician retained his position in office.
Following these events, Puce said that his ministry had begun investigating the Riga City Council. On March 21, the ministry reported that the probe had been completed and a number of possible violations had been identified, while the Riga mayor had to provide explanations about these findings. In accordance with Latvian law, the Regional Development Minister can dismiss the mayor or initiate the dissolution of the City Council. Earlier, Usakovs repeatedly vowed that if an illegal decision on his discharge was taken, he would appeal in court.

TASS, April 5. On Friday, NASA Astronaut Nick Hague hailed the record time the Progress MS-11 resupply ship took to cover the distance to the International Space Station (ISS) calling it impressive.
A Soyuz-2.1a carrier rocket with a Progress MS-11 cargo spaceship blasted off from Site No. 31 of the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 2:01 p.m. Moscow time on Thursday. Three hours and 21 minutes later the spaceship docked to the ISS. Commenting on the new record time, Director General of Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin compared the flight time to the time it takes to get from the Baikonur Cosmodrome to Moscow.
The Progress MS-11 reached the ISS to carry out its resupply mission on a two-orbit, super fast-track rendezvous profile with the orbital outpost. Before July 2018, Russia’s Progress spaceships blasted off to the ISS either under the two-day schedule (34 rotations around the planet) or it took them six hours to reach the space station (four rotations).
Russia first used the super fast-tracked rendezvous with the space station during the launch of the Progress MS-09 resupply ship, which successfully reached the orbital outpost on July 10, 2018 in slightly more than three and a half hours.The next spacecraft, the Progress MS-10, again flew to the ISS on November 16, 2018 using the old two-day scheme, as this was the first launch of a Soyuz-FG carrier rocket after the October 11, 2018 faulty liftoff.
The space freighter has delivered two tonnes of various cargoes to the space station, in particular, fuel, scientific equipment, foodstuffs and medicine.

MOSCOW, April 5. /TASS/.The Kremlin appreciates all calls for disarmament, including those coming from the US, but they should not be limited to words, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
While commenting on US President Donald Trump’s statement that the US, Russia and China should make an agreement to cut military spending, Peskov said that “any call for disarmament is commendable and worth considering.”
“The important thing is that rather than be limited to words, this call should be translated into specific initiatives and suggestions that would be handed over to partners through official channels,” he said, adding that the Kremlin had not received any suggestions of that kind from the United States.
Trump said earlier at a meeting with Chinese Vice Prime Minister Liu He that the United States, China and Russia could negotiate an agreement to cut military spending. “I feel like the military expenditure of [China] and Russia and us, it’s a lot of money that could be put in other things,” Trump said. According to him, the three countries can “come together and stop the spending and spend on things that are more productive towards long-term peace.”

KIEV, April 5. /TASS/. Ukrainian border guards have prevented more than 10,000 foreign nationals from entering the country since the beginning of this year, nearly 2,500 of them were Russian citizens, Oleg Slobodyan, spokesman for Ukraine’s State Border Guard Service, said.
“More than 10,000 foreigners have been denied entry since the beginning of 2019. Of these, almost 2,500 were Russian nationals,” he told the UNN news agency. Slobodyan noted that about 2,000 foreigners had not been allowed to cross the state border, since they were “potential illegal migrants.”
He added that the primary reason for denying entry was that foreigners found it difficult to confirm the purpose their trip to Ukraine.
Ukraine’s State Border Guard Service earlier said that Russian, Turkish and Moldovan citizens were denied entry most often.

Press review: Netanyahu’s milestone Moscow visit and Trump’s upset of NATO’s anniversary,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/press-review-netanyahus-milestone-moscow-visit-and-trumps-upset-of-natos-anniversary.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Nezavisimaya Gazeta: Israeli PM’s Moscow visit may serve as trump card in outcome of elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin has done a great favor for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in light of the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Jewish state. The two leaders held talks only five days ahead of the polls, which is crucial for Netanyahu. Experts point out that a demonstration of good ties with Russia may influence voters, Nezavisimaya Gazeta notes.
On April 9, it will become clear if Netanyahu can retain his position as prime minister. He has nothing left to do but play his trump cards, particularly demonstrating a rather high level of relations with other countries’ leaders. There is a good reason why Netanyahu is nicknamed Mr. Security: he has always given priority to foreign policy over domestic affairs.
Meanwhile, chances are that the Russian leader will visit Israel in the near future. There are many issues that require frequent Russian-Israeli meetings but the number of meetings and talks Putin and Netanyahu have held recently points to yet another goal the Israeli prime minister is pursuing, former member of the Israeli Knesset’s (parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Ksenia Svetlova told the newspaper. She emphasized that the Russian president and the Israeli prime minister had held personal talks in February, which was not so long ago. Putin and Netanyahu also had a telephone conversation on April 1. The fact that the Israeli prime minister made a visit to Moscow five days before the general elections proves that Netanyahu had deliberately chose the date for his visit to Russia, in a similar vein as his visit to the United States, where President Donald Trump signed a proclamation recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights in his presence.
“Netanyahu believes that his recent international activities, including the Washington meeting with Trump; a visit to Chad, whose relations with Israel had normalized only a few months ago; the Warsaw summit on counterterrorism, which seems to have been aimed only at making as many Arab leaders as possible gather around Netanyahu; as well as his meeting with the Russian leader, play a certain role,” Svetlova pointed out. “Netanyahu claims to be the only candidate who has good ties with leaders of almost all countries, from Russia to the US,” the expert stressed, adding that it would impress a portion of the electorate. Izvestia: Russia has the answer to Washington’s anti-Venezuela sanctions
If US lawmakers pass new legislation aimed at countering Russia’s influence in Venezuela, Moscow will have to take tit-for-tat measures, Russian Ambassador to Venezuela Vladimir Zayemsky told Izvesita. Washington has not yet clarified what kind of steps are in the works against Moscow, but the US has dropped some hints at restrictions on Russian-Venezuelan cooperation in the oil industry.
The only specific hint came from White House National Security Adviser John Bolton, who said that Washington might impose secondary sanctions on third country entities that cooperated with Venezuela’s state companies. However, the Russian envoy to Venezuela noted that the US threats would not affect the intentions of Moscow and Caracas to continue mutually beneficial cooperation.
The United States indeed can slap restrictions on certain Russian companies that cooperate with Venezuela but impressive results will hardly be achieved, said Director of the National Energy Security Fund Konstantin Simonov. “For instance, Rosneft is already under sanctions, it has gotten used to them and despite attempts to crank up pressure on the company, it has been doing well so far,” the expert noted. However, the new sanctions do carry some risks. “These sanctions can be viewed as a warning that if regime change does come to Venezuela, the country’s new authorities may refuse to fulfill the previous government’s obligations,” Simonov noted.
Russian politicians and diplomats suppose that the threat of new sanctions points to Washington’s growing frustration with the fact that its major bets to quickly change the Venezuelan regime have failed miserably.
“The US is searching for an external excuse for the failure of its plans to carry out a quick coup in Venezuela. The White House cannot just go and admit that it made a mistake by betting on Guaido, a lame duck that has been unable to encourage the people to follow him. This is why the US is using an already proven method, searching for an external enemy to blame for the failure of its plans to bring democracy to Venezuela,” Russian Institute for Strategic Studies expert Igor Pshenichnikov told the paper. “But our country has enough power, resources and wisdom to pursue a policy that we consider to be correct and necessary, based on international law, no matter if it is about Venezuela or any other country,” the expert emphasized. Rossiyskaya Gazeta: Trump rattles NATO’s 70th anniversary
The atmosphere at the NATO foreign ministers’ meeting in Washington, dedicated to the alliance’s 70th anniversary, could hardly be described as festive. The event’s hosts, US President Donald Trump (who avoided attending the meeting, which experts consider to be a strong message) and Vice President Mike Pence, lashed out at their key allies on this side of the Atlantic – Germany and Turkey, Rossiyskaya Gazeta writes.
In an interview with the newspaper, German political scientist Alexander Rahr spoke about disagreements between Washington and Berlin, and NATO’s prospects. According to him, “the alliance is deeply divided, disputes between the allied states have boiled over into serious conflicts.” “I don’t rule out that by the time NATO turns 75, we will have witnessed its death. The United States has taken a dual stance. On the one hand, it considers having control over Europe as a strategic success it does not want to lose. On the other hand, related costs have grown too high. The Americans understand perfectly well that there won’t be a war with Russia, while the alliance has failed to show its efficiency in Afghanistan, and the Europeans are reluctant to wage wars in the Middle East,” the expert pointed out.
Rahr believes that the Trump administration “has just decided to do business.” “The logic is the following: we will maintain the bloc, but our allies will have to dip into their pockets – they will buy our weapons and pay for the deployment of our missiles on their soil. Such an approach whips up debate among the Europeans, particularly in Germany, where the social welfare system is very expensive and requires huge expenditures. Berlin is ready to spend money on defense but its view of the matter is different. Rather than purchase tanks, aircraft, submarines and cruisers, (they believe) there is a need to take preventive measures, construct infrastructure facilities in Africa and the Middle East and create conditions for people living there, in order to stop migration flows to Europe,” the expert explained.
Meanwhile, Turkey’s Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA) has held a meeting in Moscow, which involved expert discussions of tensions between Ankara and Washington over Turkey’s purchase of the S-400 missile systems from Russia. According to SETA Strategy Director Hassan Yalcin, the US will continue to turn up the heat on Turkey. “However, it will not bring Turkey closer to Washington,” the expert stressed. “The S-400 missile systems are an important element of the Turkish security architecture,” he said. Izvestia: Moscow concerned about rising tensions in Libya
Russia has urged the warring sides in Libya to return to the negotiating table, Head of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Contact Group on the intra-Libyan Settlement Lev Dengov told Izvestia. The diplomat pointed out that tensions started erupting two weeks ahead of a conference that was supposed to have involved representatives of both sides: a delegation led by Fayez al-Sarraj, who heads the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, and members of the Tobruk government controlled by Libyan National Army Head Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar.
Tensions started flaring up on April 4, when Khalifa Haftar announced the beginning of a military operation “to liberate Tripoli” and called on the city’s residents to surrender and side with him. Fayez al-Sarraj, in turn, ordered to put troops on full combat alert in order to protect civilians.
According to Dengov, Moscow is concerned about the situation and urged both parties to resolve the disputes peacefully. “All this time, our county has been maintaining contacts with all parties to the conflict. We call on them to resume peaceful dialogue and confirm the positions they took at the Palermo conference,” the Russian diplomat said, adding, “the most important thing is to prevent foreign interference so the conflict can be resolved without the participation of third players.”
In fact, it was foreign meddling that has brought Libya to where it is now, said Head of the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies’ Center of the Near and Middle East Vladimir Fitin. In his view, “the interference has never stopped.” “US aircraft continue to carry out strikes on terrorist groups,” the expert noted. “The situation is unstable because there are two centers of power, as well as numerous groups that have their own armed units, but it can’t go on like this forever,” he explained.
According to Russian Senator Alexei Pushkov, since there are multiple centers of power in Libya, hardly any of the Western countries hold enough credibility to make them try to reach a compromise. Rossiyskaya Gazeta: Russia sees increase in online food ordering
Russians have been ordering vegetables, fruit and bottled water online more often than before, the Russian Association of Internet Trade Companies (AITC) told Rossiyskaya Gazeta. According to AITC President Artyom Sokolov, “online sales of food doubled in the past year.” “In this regard, Moscow, which has a 45% share of the market, is in the lead, followed by St. Petersburg (10%),” he said. Frozen food, dairy, refrigerated meat and poultry, fresh vegetables and fruit are the most popular items among online shoppers.
Director General of the Magnit food retail chain Olga Naumova, in turn, said that the company planned to launch an online ordering service with a pick-up-in-store delivery option.
As for prepared foods, the prospects are huge. Online food aggregators have every chance to elbow out restaurants. News broke recently that the average amount of money people spend on ordering food home has almost reached the average restaurant check. Due to its high popularity, the Yandex.Eats service has recently cancelled the free delivery option. Those who order prepared foods, prefer pizza, Japanese food and burgers.
Market participants are confident that the food delivery sector will continue to grow in the next three years. “In 2018, according to our estimates, the market share of online food delivery aggregators was only 15-17% but it can reach 55-60% by 2022,” said Maxim Firsov, CEO of Yandex.Eats.
People tend to choose online food delivery over going to restaurants and cooking food at home. The changing food consumption culture is believed to be the reason. “Office workers order food online more often than others, as well as busy residents of big cities, who don’t want to spend time on cooking or just don’t enjoy it,” said the Delivery Club service, which saw a twofold increase in prepared food orders in the first quarter of 2019.

NATO 70 Years Old… Still Vigorous in Aggression,www.therussophile.org,Ashley Roberts,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/nato-70-years-old-still-vigorous-in-aggression.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
When the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created 70 years ago in 1949 it was formed as a blatant military instrument for waging the Cold War, a war that the US, Britain and other European allies had newly embarked on. NATO’s public relations cant about “peace and security” is but Orwellian rhetoric.
The supposed allies of the Soviet Union hastily went from an ostensible joint purpose of defeating Nazi Germany during the Second World War to initiating hostility towards Moscow. Already in 1946, British war-time leader Winston Churchill was fulminating about “an Iron Curtain” descending across Europe, in language adapted from Third Reich propaganda maestro Joseph Goebbels. The ensuing Cold War would last for nearly half a century until the Soviet Union collapsed from its internal political and economic stresses.
NATO’s first secretary general, Britain’s Lord Ismay, was candid in the mission of the military alliance. Its objective, he said, was to, “Keep Russia out, the Americans in, and Germany down”.
Of course, Western propaganda always portrayed the Soviet Union as the “aggressor”, alleging that the so-called Red Menace had designs on conquering all of Europe. Not much has changed when one listens to Western contemporary claims of Russia being an aggressor. As in the past, present innuendo casting Moscow as a demonic force has a decidedly hollow quality, at least for those willing to be critical about Western state and media “information”.
Lord Ismay, perhaps unwittingly, let the cat out of the bag in his statement all those years ago. The purpose of NATO was to serve as a means of dividing and ruling over Europe for Washington and its always closely aligned, servile British partner.
If countering Soviet aggression was the real purpose of NATO, as officially claimed, then one must ask why is this organization still in existence – some 30 years after the alleged “evil communist empire” dissolved?
NATO is a military monster desperately in search of a purpose. The substitution of Russia as an enemy in place of the Soviet Union doesn’t quite hold the same propaganda cachet, but nonetheless that is why Moscow continues to be designated the official “enemy” – in order to justify the existence of NATO. The US-led military bloc needs enemies like a junkie needs a narcotic fix.
NATO’s real function is at least three-fold. First, it gives the US an excuse to justify its enormous military presence in Europe. Instead of appearing as an occupying force, which it is, the Americans claim to be a protector of allies against malign Russia, or formerly the Soviet Union. This allows Washington to exert political control over its so-called European allies, and specifically to prevent any normalized relations with Russia. US vice president Mike Pence this week scolded Germany and fellow NATO member Turkey for daring to continue relations with Moscow, in the form of the Nord Stream 2 gas project and Ankara’s purchase of Russian S-400 air defense system. Pence inferred treasonous conduct on the part of Berlin and Ankara just because these two nominally independent countries have chosen to do business with Russia. Pence was thus demonstrating the classic NATO purpose of dividing Europe from Moscow.
A second function of NATO is to serve as an extension of the US military-industrial complex and, in turn, an important buttress for American corporate capitalism, which is totally dependent on military spending. When President Donald Trump castigates European allies, like Germany, for not spending enough on military and NATO, his real concern is for European nations to buy more American weaponry, such as the vastly over-priced and over-rated F-35 fighter jet. If NATO were to be disbanded – as it should from its obsolete objective purpose – then US capitalism would suffer a major withdrawal of European subsidy in the form of decreased weapons purchases.
The irony here is that Trump has previously denigrated NATO as obsolete. In his irascibility, he is more correct than he seems to realize. But Trump has – despite superficial griping – still continued to boost NATO for the purpose of hiking European military spending. What Trump means by “obsolete” is that the past financial tribute from the Europeans to the US militarized economy must henceforth be significantly increased. The outrageous demands by Trump are inciting tensions within NATO. At a time of massive civilian social needs across Europe being neglected due to “fiscal constraints”, the American ultimatums for more military spending are bound to be seen by the wider European populace as an intolerable dictate.
A third function of NATO for its American leadership is that it gives a pseudo legal cover of “multinationalism” to what would otherwise be seen as blatant US imperialist aggression all over the globe.
NATO forces have assisted US illegal wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, among other interventions. This by an organization that self-declares itself a bastion of security and peace.
It was 20 years ago that US-led forces under the cover of NATO bombed Serbia and its capital Belgrade. That marked a watershed assault on international law, and the unleashing of US global violence with impunity.
Washington could not carry out its aggression without the political and legal cover of NATO. Jens Stoltenberg, the present NATO secretary general, was in Washington this week calling for more aggression towards Russia. The Norwegian figurehead is a shameless warmonger who is violating the UN Charter for the sake of feathering his career as an American puppet.
It is all the more disturbing that this week in Washington, foreign ministers of the 30 member states belonging to NATO deferred to the US calls for naval forces to be deployed to the Black Sea “in defense” of Ukraine and Georgia from “Russian aggression”. These two countries have done everything possible to provoke Russia. They are cat’s paws for their NATO master, and are reckless enough to instigate a full-on war. Washington and its NATO minions have the audacity, or intelligence deficit, to call such an explosive situation as “defense” against Russia.
NATO, or rather the US, is giving itself a green light to mount even more aggression against Russia than it already has done over the past 30 years. In that period, NATO membership has almost doubled with the result that the military bloc is now on Russia’s border – and at the same time claiming with Orwellian double-think that it is defending Europe from Russian aggression. As Russian wit would have it: Russia has had the temerity to move its border towards NATO offensive forces.
Global security and peace is too serious for jokes. The maintenance of NATO, with its original aggressive objective against Moscow still intact, is a grotesque joke. A joke sickeningly played on the people of Europe who could benefit greatly from halting the squandering of billions of dollars each year on military budgets. NATO’s gratuitous belligerence towards Russia – based on trumped-up, ridiculous propaganda – is an obscenity. This organization is a dinosaur that somehow outlived its Cold War environment because those powers who control it from Washington and London want it to live on for their own selfish, ideological, economic reasons.
For the sake of world peace, the citizens of North America and Europe should demand that NATO be liquidated. Thirty years too late.

Why Putin’s Christian Faith Is Most Likely Authentic,www.therussophile.org,Dr. Matthew Raphael Johnson,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/why-putins-christian-faith-is-most-likely-authentic.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Vladimir Putin is fairly mute about his own religious views. Being a member of the Communist Party is no evidence of atheism. Its evidence only of conformity. Party membership was essential for having any a career of any substantial kind, especially in the security services.
Military and police careers were, as in all societies, attractive to patriots and nationalists, though it had to be a “Soviet” rather than a specifically Russian nationalism. However, he does say that he was secretly baptized by his mother at 18 months in Petersburg at the Cathedral of the Martyrs Alexandria and Antonia of Rome. From this, it is safe to say that Putin was secretly taught the faith from a young age.
According to his mother, it was the day of St. Michael and all the Angels, so it had to be November 21st. Putin’s views are, in hos own words, to be internal, and never the subject of a show. The cross that his mother gave him at the Sepulcher Church in Jerusalem he wears always. In his house many years ago, a fire broke out from the heating unit of the sauna malfunctioning. Worried that the cross, which he had left near his bed, was gone forever, once of the workmen found it perfectly intact in the midst of all the rubble.
Putin stated on Larry King that he sees this event as a miracle and a “revelation.” His personal commitment to Orthodoxy never wavered afterwards. Normally he goes to obscure, rural churches to spend the holidays, wishing to avoid the cameras and distractions of the major cities. His natural constituency is the Orthodox population, who, as polls have stated since the mid 1990s, trust the patriarch more than anyone else in Russia, even more than Putin himself.
Unlike Slobodan Milosevic, Putin is clearly comfortable and at home in an Orthodox setting, and his ritual movements are smooth and comfortable, not jerky and artificial as might be expected for a hypocritical display. Milosevic was noted for his awkwardness in Orthodox churches in the 1990s, suggesting he had no experience in them. The only time he seemed slightly stiff is when, upon kissing an icon, the background noise was of hundreds of cameras taking pictures.
This is one of the videos in which Putin reveals the origin of his faith.
[embedded content]
It shows us the following:
Putin first speaks about his Baptism: 02:00
He believes in the traditional Russian family: 04:03
Over 65,000 Russians defend the Church: 08:02
The Orthodox bikers in the new Russia: 10:52
Putin’s acknowledges the saints and martyrs murdered by the communists: 11:45
Putin is far superior for the church than Peter the Great and many others. Non-Orthodox monarchs in Russia history include Peter I, who was a materialist Freemason. His successor, the mockery “Catherine I,” who was a former prostitute from Germany taken as war booty by Peter. She was placed on the throne in mockery, similar to the French Revolutionaries placing a prostitute on the throne of the Bishop of Paris during the terror. Lord Biron, a Freemason who ruled while the two “Empress Annas” tried on outfits), Peter III who was a Lutheran, soon murdered by, Catherine II, a Deist and vehemently anti-Orthodox and anti-Russian. Alexander I dabbled in the occult, while Alexander II was generally secular. At the same time, these and other monarchs placed atheists and masons as head of the synod on a regular basis. Putin is far more Orthodox than those monarchs.
Putin’s concern with ecumenism with Rome is puzzling. His constituency is Orthodox and nationalist. He has only to lose with this policy. Yet, no one else on earth right now has done more to strengthen and spread Orthodox than Putin and the Moscow Patriarchate. On February 13, 2012, Putin condemned the Red Army in the Russian Civil War. In 2012, 65,000 gathered at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow to defend the church against Pussy Riot and other attacks on it. This is the new Russia.
Back in 2001, Izvestia interviewed Putin’s spiritual father, the Archimandrite Tikhon (Shevkunov) of the Sretensky Monastery. This was December of 2001, probably prior to anyone really knowing too much about his policy agenda. The Archimandrite stated:
Putin is really an Orthodox Christian really, and not nominally. He confesses, receives communion and is aware of his responsibility before God for the ministry entrusted to him from on high and for his immortal soul.
The burden and severity of the problems he is undertaking to solve and his responsibility for these is truly enormous. Anyone who really loves Russia and wishes her well can only pray for Vladimir whom the Providence of God sent to deliver Russia.
The Archimandrite was himself sent to prison by the old KGB and had members of his family perish because of them. Thus, Putin’s background in this organization did not initially endear him to the President. However, he soon was convinced of Putin’s Orthodox mind. In his book, the Archimandrite writes:
Combining the modern Russian state with past forms, Putin has undertaken a huge effort to connect it to the heavens. The construction of churches, the reconstruction of destroyed parishes, monasteries and the revival of Russian shrines has become an urgent matter for Putin.
For the dark, soulless landscape that was imposed on Russia after 1991 – one dominated by nihilism, anger, and nonsense mercantile scams – Russia was in a condition completely unsuitable for any future development. Anything built in this context, any laboratory or university, immediately plunged into the abyss of a toxic lifestyle.
The restoration of churches and monasteries is truly the creation of huge sewage treatment plants which are to filter and processing the fetid waste of the 1990s. It is the construction of spiritual filters through which passes the poisoned spirit of the Russian people.
In his visit to Valaam, Putin stated that “without Orthodoxy, there would be no Russia.”
On the website of the Valaam monastery, they speak of the sincerity of the President’s faith. They state that visiting the northern shrines was a “turning point” for Putin and began a sincere conversion. He ensured that there was a minimum of meetings and no talk of politics. On August 16th of 2001 Putin first began his pilgrimage and acted like an “ordinary believer.” He walked the three kilometers to the main monastery to St. Nicholas’ skete. He then decreed that the island of Anzer be granted officially to the church and more specifically, the monastery of Solovki.
On the 1025th anniversary of the baptism of Rus under St. Vladimir, Putin stated:
Today, when people are again looking for moral support, millions of our fellow citizens see their Russian Orthodox religion as a beacon.
Trust the wise pastoral words of the Russian Orthodox Church. Her selfless, educational and social service demand respect. Her public authority and peacekeeping efforts aimed at strengthening the harmony and stability of Russia, as well as her efforts to restore the historical ties among peoples, and especially with our compatriots abroad, has been her legacy.
It is also important that a new level of state-church relations has developed.
We act as genuine partners and as co-workers in solving the most pressing domestic and international challenges in the implementation of joint ventures for the benefit of our country and people.
On the 90th anniversary of the restoration of the Patriarchate, Putin stated:
The Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church helped the people survive the agony of the 20th century. It helped defend the faith, to unite the flock and to save not just the church, but the ideas of Christianity. And later, already in a revival of religious life, the Church has helped continue his tireless service.
And today, we appreciate the desire of the Russian Orthodox Church to return the ideals and values to Russian society that for centuries were our spiritual landmarks (Putin, 2007).
It is common to condemn Putin for being a “KGB agent.” the truth is that the security services of any nation attract nationalists. Few doctrinaire Marxists existed in the USSR. This is the exclusive domain of capitalist universities. Putin has condemned Marxism and communism. He has stated that the fall of the USSR was a great “catastrophe.” Indeed it was: Solzhenitsyn said the same. The destruction of the Soviet economy in a few years and its liquidation into the bank accounts of a few Jewish oligarchs is well known. The USSR was preferable to the 1990s in Russia. The life expectancy of the Russian male went down to under 60 years.
To be a career man of any kind in the USSR, one had to join the party. Spouting a few slogans that no one believed is a minor price to pay for the ability to feed one’s family. Putin clearly (albeit secretly) rejected the party’s atheism. He was and is a Russian nationalist. My book, Russian Populist: The Political Thought of Vladimir Putin (TBR Press, 2012) shows this at great length. I’ve translated some speeches and writings that have not seen the light of day in the west. The revelations of Putin’s secret baptism make sense out of his post-soviet career and ideological development.

Russia warns US over claims of Iran behind deaths of 600 troops,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/russia-warns-us-over-claims-of-iran-behind-deaths-of-600-troops.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

Moscow has warned Washington over claims that Iran was behind the deaths of more than 600 US troops in Iraq, saying the allegation is aimed at escalating tensions with Tehran.
“We were surprised to read the statement by US State Department Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook, in which he claims that Iran is involved in the death of 600 US troops in Iraq,” said Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Thursday.
Zakharova stressed that the US needs to be held responsible for its provocative statements amid Washington’s extreme “anti-Iranian sentiment.”
“There is an impression that the US is thinking up another excuse to explain the escalation of relations with Iran if they deem it appropriate,” she said.
Zakharova’s comments come after Hook made the allegations citing a Pentagon report on Tuesday. Hook also stated that the US is not looking to grant any further sanction waivers to countries importing Iranian oil in a bid to ramp up pressure on Iran.
Warning of a new escalation of US pressure against Iran, Zakharova highlighted Washington’s occupation of Iraq in 2003 as a demonstration of the country’s “aggressive” foreign policy.
“There should be no doubt that American intervention against Iraq will remain in history as the gravest violation of international law and a de facto criminal act,” she said.
The spokeswoman further advised the US “not to look for excuses to start a new conflict, increasing the suffering throughout the world with its aggressive policy.”
The US, backed by the UK, invaded Iraq under the pretext that the regime of Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in 2003. No such weapons were ever found in Iraq.
More than one million Iraqis were killed as a result of the invasion and subsequent occupation of the country, according to the California-based investigative organization Project Censored.
US policies in Iraq further led to the emergence of many terrorist groups in the country, ultimately leading to the creation of the infamous Daesh Takfiri terrorist group which overran vast swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014.
Iran, however, has been offering military advisory support to Iraq, along with Syria, at the request of their governments, enabling their forces to speed up their gains on various fronts against the terror outfits.
Following Daesh’s defeat in Iraq in late 2017, Baghdad has further deepened its political and economic ties with Tehran seeking assistance in post-war reconstruction.
Heading a high-level delegation, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran made a historic visit to Iraq last month.
The two neighbors announced several economic trade deals , including in the fields of energy, railway, health, investment, and tourism, with the aim of increasing their annual trade volume from the current $12 billion to $20 billion and offsetting new American sanctions on Tehran.
Observers have described the visit as a clear message to the US, whose President Donald Trump year made an unannounced trip to a military base in Iraq’s al-Anbar Province last year, where no Iraqi officials were present to receive him.
Trump’s abrupt visit prompted many Iraqi figures and lawmakers to call for a complete removal of US troops from the country.

Why Russians drink birch juice,www.therussophile.org,Barry Lando,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/why-russians-drink-birch-juice.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
No, it’s not a joke. For Russians, the birch tree is not just a national symbol, but the source of a tasty(ish) drink.
It is said that Russians uprooted from their native soil yearn, above all, for boundless birch groves stretching over the horizon. But not only because the birch is a very huggable tree. Its sap can be extracted and consumed. And you thought that the strangest Russian dish was kholodets ? Get real. A taste of childhood
Grigory Kalachyan/TASS
Birch juice became popular back in the USSR in the post-war years, when nutritious foods were in short supply. The juice was cheap and easy to produce, and of course plentiful. And the benefits were beyond doubt—it’s brimming with vitamins B6 and B12, great for shiny skin and hair, and it’s a wonderful thirst quencher, too.
“Birch sap has a very specific taste, but I like it,” says Semyon from Moscow. “It’s a bit sweet, but you have to try it for yourself to understand what it’s about,” his colleague Alexei chimes in, admitting that he likes to give this unusual drink to foreigners.
Although very popular in Soviet times, birch juice was soon squeezed out (pardon the pun) by modern fizzy drinks.
“Back in the early 1980s, there was a shortage of Buratino (Soviet lemonade). Of all the juices sold in stores by the glass, it was birch sap that came closest to this beloved lemonade for probably every schoolchild,” Oleg recalls. To the forest
Egor Eryomov/Sputnik
Russian law permits the gathering of “edible forest resources” for personal use. This category includes berries, mushrooms, nuts, and birch sap. It should be collected only in springtime and only in ecologically clean areas, because harmful substances can accumulate in the tree.
The gathering season runs from late March till mid-April, when the snow is melting and the first buds are appearing.
Extracting the sap of a young tree will kill it, so this is not done. Experts say that the older the birch, the sweeter the juice. A small tree gives about three liters of sap, and a large one 5-7. How to extract it
Legion Media
A notch is cut into the birch bark, and a metal chute inserted into the hole for the juice to flow into the collecting can. Do not use an ax. The most “humane” way is to drill a small hole in the tree. The smaller the incision, the faster the tree will recover post-surgery. Experienced sap-hunters reckon that the best collecting time is from noon till sunset. After extracting, the incision should be smeared with clay, wax, or moss.
The sap keeps for no longer than a couple of days. So as not to waste any of it, it can also be used in making kvass, okroshka soup, or syrup.
Birch sap is also used in cosmetic formulas. Washing or rubbing the face with a piece of frozen birch water tones and rejuvenates the skin. And rinsing one’s hair with birch sap makes it grow better and easier to keep clean. Where to try it
Mikhail Voskresenskiy/Sputnik
If you’re not burning with desire to wander through the forest in search of a hallowed tree, but want to know what birch juice tastes like anyway, then check out any large Russian supermarket.
Alexei warns that almost all juice sold in stores is pasteurized and comes with additives, but it is always totally safe to drink. However, it doesn’t compare with the fresh variety, Roman admits: “The stuff sold in bottles nowadays just ain’t the real deal. It’s a far cry from a mug of birch sap fresh from the tree—that’s a journey straight back to childhood!” If using any of Russia Beyond’s content, partly or in full, always provide an active hyperlink to the original material.

"INSIDER’S Nicole Einbinder Interviews VDARE.Com’s Peter Brimelow, by Peter Brimelow",www.therussophile.org,Peter Brimelow,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/insiders-nicole-einbinder-interviews-vdare-coms-peter-brimelow-by-peter-brimelow.html/,"This post was originally published on this site I see that Main Stream Media-licensed immigration patriot/ Trump supporter-lite Victor Davis Hanson was annoyed at the editing of a phone Q&A he did with the New Yorker’s Isaac Chotiner [ Tweet him ] published as The Classicist Who Sees Donald Trump as a Tragic Hero [February 20, 2019], and demanded that the full transcript be published, which, needless to say, doesn’t seem to have happened . It’s certainly true that Chotiner’s introductory claim that Hanson “has a history of hostility to undocumented [i.e. illegal] Mexican and Central American immigrants [sic—actually aliens], who he claims are undermining American culture” is absurd, as I documented in my American Conservative review of Hanson’s wonderful but distinctly wimpish 2003 book Mexifornia . But the fact is that rising tide of Leftist lunacy means that MSM reporters/ PC enforcers now feel they have a particular license to lie. No patriot should ever talk to them over the phone without recording it ( looking at you, Rep. Steve King ). Personally, I insist on conducting MSM interviews by email—which, significantly, scares many away. However, answering stupid questions does focus the mind and the exchanges have resulted in a couple of useful articles ( here and here ). Recently, I had an exchange with Nicole Einbinder [ Email her ]of something called thisisinsder.com . She seems to be a nice sheltered twenty-something who has never thought about any of the issues she was charged with reporting and, not surprisingly, I wasn’t sufficiently inflammatory to be quoted in White nationalists and the alt-right are disillusioned with Trump — and some are joining the Yang Gang . [March 26, 2019] To Einbinder’s credit, she did pick up on the anomaly that many so-called white nationalists/ supremacists (Facebook has officially decreed they are the same thing, so they must be, right?) are intrigued by Chinese-American Democrat contender Andrew Yang: For many nationalists, Yang’s ethnicity is a non-issue. Picciolini [ Tweet him ] the former white supremacist, said “If you look at their views of white supremacy, they hold Asians in very, very high regard because of their exclusive culture,” adding that “They believe that Asian culture has it right.” But Einbinder quickly puts that through the ideological converter: “Certainly while [Trump] didn’t create [the white nationalist] problem, he’s lit the fuse that has sparked it to grow once again,” Picciolini told INSIDER. “I think things are going to get worse before they get better, and that’s because the government has not focused on white supremacy as a threat.” “Focused on white supremacy” = repressing white America, a.k.a the Historic American Nation . Our (scrupulously edited) interview: Do those in the white nationalist and far-right movement feel that president Trump supports them? Preamble: As I have repeatedly explained VDARE.com is not a “white nationalist” site and I am not a “white nationalist,” although I do think white nationalism in the sense of representing white interests is a legitimate position cf. Black Nationalism , La Raza , Zionism . And it is NOT the same as White Supremacy. Also, we are not “far right.” Everyone else is far Left. We are immigration patriots, in the sense that we think current immigration levels are an existential threat to America. (We used to be “immigration reformers,” but that term was stolen by the Amnestiacs , with the usual MSM collusion). On Trump: My sense is that immigration patriots have reached a breaking point with Trump, because of his failure to legislate or even get control of the border, and particularly because of his sudden talk about INCREASING legal immigration and his treatment of Ann Coulter e.g. John Derbyshire here. Ann Coulter is well able to take care of herself & doesn’t need me doing the job: but for me & I’m sure many, many other Former Trumpers, this https://t.co/14wfxZUTXd is the last straw. The guy is worthless ─ a stupid bullshitter who got very lucky https://t.co/4bTmWRpVK3 . — John Derbyshire (@DissidentRight) March 10, 2019 One of those links goes to Trump tweeting against Ann Coulter, the other to the Z-Man blog , which calls Trump a “stupid bullshitter who got very lucky” based on Trump’s betrayal of gun owners after Las Vegas. Personally, I think Trump is completely unpredictable and it’s not impossible he’ll rotate back. But he’s sure going to have to DO something to get e.g. Ann back on board. Looking at the hard-core Right, the disgust is really intense. As I’m sure you’re aware, the extremely NSFW podcast Fash The Nation finally broke with him for very explicit reasons on Saturday[March 17]: FTN 198: Donald J. Trap . You could also check out the Southern Nationalist site Occidental Dissent e.g. Ann Coulter Demands Exact Coordinates Of Orange Man’s “Border Wall” , March 13, 2019 You are right that there’s intense bitterness that Trump is not supporting his supporters e.g. the Trump DOJ, instead of litigating against AntiFa, which has essentially violently driven the Dissident Right and even Conservatism Inc. types like Charles Murray out of the public square, is instead prosecuting Trump supporters who simply defend themselves . What is your reaction to the president’s comments claiming that the movement is small? He’s certainly correct that the number of white terrorist attacks is utterly miniscule compared to Muslim attacks (or even black crime). (The ADL numbers are obviously fallacious —e.g. no real evidence the Parkland shooter [ Nikolas Cruz ] was a white nationalist and the Kroger shooter had been married to a black woman.) But as the New Zealand shooter Brenton Tarrant put it in his manifesto[ PDF ] (which you should read), Trump as “a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose” won the election. That’s not “small”, even if “as a policy maker and leader” he’s done nothing. What are your general thoughts about the Trump administration, and do you feel that he has helped to make white nationalist thought more mainstream? See above on general thoughts . I think Trump won as an implicitly white candidate, although he shows absolutely no sign of being anything other than a civic nationalist. But this is also why the Left opposes him so hysterically, and that’s resulted in an unprecedented wave of (non-governmental) repression of Dissident Right sites (see here ). e.g., the day after Trump won, at least a dozen New York Proud Boys were dismissed from their (relatively menial) jobs by angry Democrat employers; e.g. VDARE.com been deplatformed by Amazon , Google AdSense , Constant Contact, MailChimp etc. e.g. here’s been a wave of physical attacks on Trump supporters, completely unreported by the MSM , of course. Trump has done absolutely nothing about this, although even just tweeting about it would help. So Trump’s victory actually made it MORE difficult to express “white nationalist [or even patriot] thought.” But ultimately, what drives “white nationalist thought” is demography. Whites are realizing there is no place for them in the Democratic Party. It’s tipping , like a housing project. Has political rhetoric influenced the movement at all and, if so, are there particular actions made by the federal government that support views expressed by VDARE? Trump’s tweets were galvanizing. But there’s now widespread skepticism because there’s never any follow-through. What is your reaction to last week’s shooting in New Zealand? Are those in the white nationalist and far-right movement feeling more emboldened than ever before? My impression is that they feel more exposed, persecuted—and embittered. What role does social media play in helping promote your messaging? The internet was critical in breaking the MSM’s gatekeeper function. Since Trump’s election, however, there’s been massive shadow-banning, deplatforming etc. by Silicon Valley SJWs. The good news is that, as far as I can see, there is opposition to Silicon Valley right across the political spectrum and some sort of regulation/ legislation is inevitable. The bad news is that the Democrats will try to smuggle in censorship. Trump/ GOP are too stupid to notice. I spoke with someone in the white nationalist movement who told me that those in the movement are largely supporting Andrew Yang for the 2020 election. I’m wondering if this is something you have heard and if you also may be supporting Yang heading into 2020. Yeah, it’s a thing. (See Patriots Turning To #YangGang In Response To Trump, Conservatism Inc. Failure . )Partly because he’s unique in mentioning the White Death . Trump was a wrecking ball that patriots used against the GOP Establishment and Yang is a wrecking ball used against Trump It’s completely nihilistic in that no-one has any belief Yang can or will do anything. It’s just a desire to screw things up. Personally, I could never support Yang because I’m a one-issue voter and he’s useless on immigration. Just to clarify, do you identify as white supremacist? I believe the links above clarify that. I’m not a white supremacist or even a white nationalist, although I do think that whites have common interests they can legitimately defend. I regard myself a civic nationalist, although a pessimistic one, because I think immigration policy is importing racial polarization. VDARE is a forum site and will publish anyone of any color or creed who has rational criticism of the post-1965 immigration disaster. You have to realize that “white supremacy” and “white nationalism” (there’s a difference, but they’re usually conflated) are simply terms of abuse the Left uses to suppress rational criticism of immigration policy, and to intimidate the GOP from appealing to its own base. It’s the equivalent of me calling Beto O’Rourke (or you) a Communist."
"The Media Smoothed the Path to British Soldiers Using Corbyn as Target Practice, by Jonathan Cook",www.therussophile.org,Jonathan Cook,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-media-smoothed-the-path-to-british-soldiers-using-corbyn-as-target-practice-by-jonathan-cook.html/,"This post was originally published on this site It is time to stop believing these infantile narratives the British political and media establishments have crafted for us. Like the one in which they tell us they care deeply about the state of political life, and that they lie awake at night worrying about the threat posed by populism to our democratic institutions. How do they persuade us of the depth of their concern? They express their horror at at the murder of an MP, Jo Cox, and their outrage at the abuse of another, Anna Soubry – both victims of the frenzied passions unleashed by Brexit. But the political and media elites don’t really care whether politicians are assaulted, vilified or threatened – at least, not if it is the kind of politician who threatens their power. They aren’t seriously worried about attacks on democracy, or about political violence, or about the rottenness at the core of state institutions. Their outrage is selective. It is rooted not in principle, but in self-interest. Is that too cynical? Ponder this. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hasn’t faced just shouted insults from afar, like Soubry. He was recently physically assaulted, hit on the head by a man holding an egg in his fist. But unlike Soubry, our media expressed no real concern. In fact, they could barely hide their sniggers at his “ egging ”, an attack they presented as little more than a prank. They even hinted that Corbyn deserved it. ‘Kill vampire Jezza’ The media have been only happy too to vilify Corbyn as a Kremlin stooge and a former Soviet spy. Senior Tory Iain Duncan Smith this week called Corbyn “a Marxist whose sole purpose in life is to do real damage to the country” – a remark that, as ever went, entirely unchallenged by the BBC interviewer giving him a platform. Just imagine a Labour MP being allowed to accuse Theresa May of being a fascist whose only goal is to destroy the country. But the BBC has never bothered to conceal its intense dislike of Corbyn. Its news shows have even photoshopped the Labour leader to make him look “Russian” – or “more Russian”, as the BBC and the rest of the media mischievously phrased it. Those who protested were told they were reading too much into it. They needed to lighten up and not take themselves so seriously. Senior Conservatives, including the former defence secretary Michael Fallon, have regularly portrayed Corbyn as a threat to national security, especially over concerns about the Trident nuclear missile system. Many senior members of Corbyn’s own party have echoed such smears – all amplified, of course, by the media. Those who suggested that the government and media needed to engage with Corbyn’s well-grounded doubts about the safety of nuclear weapons, or the economics and practicalities of the Trident programme, were derided – like Corbyn – as “pacifists” and “traitors”. And the mood music to these political clashes was the quite literal demonisation of Corbyn by the red-top dailies. Most famously, the Daily Mail photoshopped him as Dracula, above the headline: “Labour must KILL vampire Jezza.” Degraded political culture Then Corbyn became the target of another sustained smear campaign. It was claimed that this lifelong, very public anti-racism activist – who over decades had forged strong ties to sections of the British Jewish community, despite being a steadfast critic of Israel – was a secret anti-semite, or at best providing succour to anti-semites as they overran the Labour party. Was there any factual basis or evidence for these claims? No. But the British public was assured by rightwing Jews like the Board of Deputies and by “leftwing” Jewish supporters of Israel like Jonathan Freedland that evidence wasn’t necessary, that they had a sixth sense for these things. Corbyn’s supporters were told that they should not question the wildly inflammatory and evidence-free denunciations of Corbyn and the wider Labour membership for a supposed “institutional anti-semitism” – and, with a satisfyingly circular logic, that to do so was itself proof of anti-semitism. The weaponisation of anti-semitism through political spin by Corbyn’s political enemies, including the Blairite faction of the parliamentary Labour party, was and is a dangerous assault on public life, one that has very obviously degraded Britain’s political culture. Too toxic to lead Labour The smear was meant to override the membership’s wishes and make Corbyn too toxic to lead Labour. It has also politicised the anti-semitism allegation, weakening it for a section of the population, and irresponsibly inflaming fears among other sections. It has deflected attention from the very real threat of a rising tide of rightwing racism, both Islamophobia and the kind of anti-semitism that relates to Jews, not Israel. Then, there was the serving British general who was given a platform by the Sunday Times – anonymously, of course – to accuse Corbyn of being a threat to Britain’s security. The general warned that the army’s senior command would never allow Corbyn near Number 10. They would launch a coup first. But no one in the corporate media or the political establishment thought the interview worthy of much attention, or demanded an investigation to find out which general had threatened to overturn the democratic will of the people. The story was quickly dropped down the memory hole. Those who sought to draw attention to it were told to move on, that there was nothing to see. And now, this week, footage has emerged showing British soldiers – apparently taking their commanders’ expressed wishes more seriously than the media – using a poster of Corbyn as target practice out in Afghanistan. Questioning ‘security credentials’ Do the media and politicians really care about any of this? Are they concerned, let alone as outraged as they were at Soubry’s earlier discomfort at the verbal abuse she faced? Do they understand the seriousness of this threat to British political life, to the safety of the leader of the opposition, they themselves have stoked? The signs are still far from reassuring. Theresa May did not think it worth using prime minister’s questions to condemn the video, to send an unequivocal message that Britain’s political choices would never be decided by violence. No one else in the chamber apparently thought to raise the matter either. Sky News even used the footage to question yet again Corbyn’s “security credentials”, as though the soldiers might thereby have grounds for treating him as a legitimate target. The clues as to where all this is leading are not hard to fathom. The white nationalist who drove into a crowd outside Finsbury Park mosque in London in 2017, killing a worshipper, admitted at his trial that the real target had been Corbyn. An unexpected roadblock foiled his plans. The fact is that no one in the political or media class cares much whether their constant trivialising of Corbyn’s political programme degrades British political life, or whether their smears could lead to political violence, or whether four years of their incitement might encourage someone to use more than an egg and a fist against Corbyn. So let’s stop indulging the media and politicians as they cite Jo Cox’s murder and Anna Soubry’s intimidation as evidence of their democratic sensibilities and their commitment to political principle. The truth is they are charlatans. They will use anything – from the murder of an MP to confections of anti-semitism and smears about treason – to incite against a democratic politician who threatens their domination of the political system. It is their refusal to engage with a political argument they know they will lose, and to allow a democratic process to take place that they fear will produce the wrong result, that is setting the scene for greater polarisation and frustration. And ultimately for more violence. Jonathan Cook won the Martha Gellhorn Special Prize for Journalism.

$7 billion worth equipment at an abandoned US base in Paktika province in eastern Afghanistan have been stolen after the camp was handed to Afghan forces in 2014.
“There was equipment worth seven billion dollars at the PRT base and all of them were looted,” the provincial governor Mujib Rahman Samkanai said, according to TOLO News . “Former governors, commanders, mayors, directors, parliament members all are involved in this act.”
He stressed that each and every official have taken their part from the remains of the Provincial Reconstruction Team’s (PRT) base named Camp Kearney. The military base is located near the governor’s compound.
“They entered the PRT base and looted it. Based on my information, they even looted locked containers full of computers, weapons, and even Humvees and Pickup vehicles had existed at the base,” Samkanai said.
Paktika Police Chief Gen. Ghulam Sakhi Rogh Lewanai coonfirmed that the equipment is missing. He added that he has shared this issue with the Interior Ministry. However, taking into account a massive level of fraud in this field, it’s unlikely that any guilty person will be punished.
According to TOLO News’ source, in 2013-2014 US forces left the base and handed equipment worth nearly $8 billion to the Jabuk government. Now, only about $1bn worth equipment still exist at the base. The rest of are either broken, looted or stolen. MORE ON THE TOPIC:"

southfront.org Donate Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s interview with the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets, Moscow, April 3, 2019 ( source ):
Question : It is widely believed that creating the best environment for domestic development is one of the main goals of foreign policy. How well is Russian foreign policy coping with this task?
Sergey Lavrov : It is not just “widely believed.” It is a postulate incorporated in foreign policy documents, such as the Foreign Policy Concept and other fundamental strategic papers which form the basis of our work and our country’s foreign policy activities.
It’s hard for me to give assessments. You run the risk of immodesty or underestimating yourself. But, trying to be objective, I will say that, in the current circumstances, I think, we are doing all the necessary things. The result may not be 100 percent, but, in general, it’s in positive territory.
Question : Many think that Russia’s foreign policy at the moment is characterised by a sense of complete hopelessness. Things are hopeless in our relations with the United States and Ukraine …
Sergey Lavrov : If you build your foreign policy around relations with the United States or any other individual country, or even a group of countries, for example, the European Union or NATO, you risk ending up in a situation where you will be punished, which is what we are now witnessing.
What are we being punished for? For us wanting the Russian-speaking people, our compatriots, not to be persecuted or discriminated against, not to be threatened by radical nationalists and outright neo-Nazis, as was the case, for example, in Crimea. Shortly after the coup, Dmitry Yarosh, as “the hero of Maidan and the ruler of Ukraine’s fate,” proclaimed that Russians should be expelled from Crimea or destroyed there, because they will never think like Ukrainians and never worship Bandera or Shukhevych.
We also want a “belt of neighbourliness” around us, not military bloc infrastructure, the doctrinal tenets of which have deterrence of Russia as the main, if not the only, rationale for their existence, as is the case with NATO expansion. As soon as a country is drawn into NATO in the absence of any visible threats to its security, US military bases are immediately created on its territory. A third NATO-US base is being built in Georgia now.
We also want the perimeter around us to be safe. We want a world order based on international law, because it guarantees predictability. We need predictability for our plans so that no one tries to alter the UN Charter or the existing rules. We need predictability and an order built around international law so as to be able to develop our business and economic relations with foreign countries, or investment, so that no one dares to run from government to government of the countries with which we enjoy positive relations and demand that they kick out Russian investors. I gave you a rough overview, but this is the challenge we are working on now.
I do realise that opportunism is now prevalent in the international arena. It all began long before the events in Ukraine, back in 2011. I have repeatedly mentioned that as soon as Edward Snowden chose freedom and refused to go to a place where he would face the electric chair, the Americans immediately began to try to punish us. Then, there was the Magnitsky Act. All this was before Ukraine. Ukraine just lit a fire under their efforts, but showed them that we will not put up with the oppression of Russian people who want to preserve Russian culture or, at least, have respect for it. This was the only possible solution.
Of course, we are now in a situation where our leadership has realised that we cannot rely on the countries that used to be our strategic partners, such as the EU, which did the bidding of the United States in its desire to regain world dominance. Our policy in the international arena now must look to the future. We shouldn’t just be guided in our politics by how sorry we are that we are not allowed to do certain things on the continental shelf, for example. We need to continue to ensure that the system based on the Western model of economic development or even the dominance of the dollar, which has been crudely abused recently, ceases to be something what we rely on in our actions.
The Chinese are now creating their own system. We are creating the Eurasian Economic Union and coordinating it with China’s Belt and Road initiative. This is a long process of departing from the dollar and dependence on Washington’s whims and on what kind of administration will come to power there next and how it will manipulate things from Congress. But without these long-term plans, we will never rid ourselves of this dependence. We need to create a strategy that ultimately, albeit after an extended historical period, will ensure our country’s stability and independence.
Question: Have we correctly assessed our own stamina in this game over the long term? Or will we crack under Western pressure?
Sergey Lavrov: I believe that although there were periods in our more than a thousand year history when we came close to cracking, our people are able to pass any trial with honour and dignity. I am convinced of this.
Question: Is it possible that in trying to break away from Washington, we will become excessively dependent on Beijing? Have you noticed the public outcry over the plans to build a plant on Lake Baikal?
Sergey Lavrov: The plant on Lake Baikal is a separate subject. I have taken a particular interest in it. This was presented as if a pipe is being built to go directly to China. I think environmentally literate people, including not only our officials – ministers, their deputies and experts – but also representatives of NGOs should go there and take a look.
I read a big story by a journalist who went there. Of course, the assessments are fairly alarming but this is not about the pipe as it was initially presented but about water bottling. Bottled water from Lake Baikal has long been sold in the Russian Federation. It is certainly possible to find here some balance between the interests of preserving this unique lake as a part of world heritage on the one hand, and the interests of our exports, including to China, on the other.
As for dependence on China – many speak about it. Moreover, the US and Europe already understand that Belt and Road initiative is a competitor to what is happening in the world now. It is not even limited to Eurasia but also involves Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America. This reflects the fact that China has become a strong economic and financial power. Political influence comes with economic and financial power. It is inevitable.
We proceed from the premise that we will never take part in projects that are aimed at gaining unilateral advantages without account of the partner’s interests. The status of our relations with the PRC, which are now on an upswing unlike anything we have seen in all previous centuries, allows us to resolve issues by seeking compromise.
The EAEU has signed an agreement with the PRC. It is not preferential. We are not opening our markets to be instantly flooded with Chinese goods. The Chinese understand this and suggest forms of cooperation that will allow us, the EAEU, and, of course, them to benefit.
We haven’t yet determined all the concrete forms of cooperation. But I have no doubt that we stand to gain from transit from China to Europe via the Russian Federation both over land and the Northern Sea Route because any transit projects are bound to develop the territories through which they pass. The Belt and Road concept provides for five to six routes that may be used by the Russian Federation to offer transit services and simultaneously develop adjacent territories.
Question: Russia speaks a lot about protecting the rights of Russians in Ukraine and the Baltic states. Why isn’t the Russian government as active in protecting the rights of Russians in Central Asia?
Sergey Lavrov: I wouldn’t say that we don’t do enough in this respect but it is always possible to do more. We monitor the situation quite closely. The main thing here, as you understand, is not to clamour but to seek practical solution to all our concerns. Rest assured that we raise this issue with our Central Asian partners and will continue insisting that they take it into account in their work.
We understand the aspiration of every nation that respects itself and its national history to consolidate its own identity and the identity of its people, its destiny. Regrettably, once this process starts, it sometimes gets out of hand. We have seen the statistics. Quite recently I chaired a meeting of the Government Commission on Compatriots Living Abroad. Among other things, we listened to a report on implementing the assistance programme for the voluntary resettlement of compatriots living abroad to Russia. We are talking about the return of tens of thousands of people from Central Asian countries, and we told our colleagues about this. If they are interested in preserving the multi-ethnic and multi-religious identity of their countries, they should take some measures to allow Russians and Russian-speakers feel like full citizens. This is what these citizens want, both there and in the Baltic states. What’s more, it is unfair of Estonia and Latvia to deprive our compatriots of the right to vote, because during independence referendums their votes were counted. The overwhelming majority of these people voted for independence. In other words, they wanted and want to be loyal citizens of these states. There is some progress in this respect but obviously not enough.
Question: How does Montenegro’s and Macedonia’s accession to NATO threaten Russia’s national security?
Sergey Lavrov: I have already mentioned that, unfortunately, NATO sees its raison d’etre entirely in containing the Russian Federation. In the past, the Afghanistan campaign was the glue holding it together. Now it has receded into the background. Americans are trying to navigate the situation there on their own. I’ll note as an aside that they are unlikely to succeed. We certainly need to look for collective solutions to advance the Afghan settlement process. In this context, in addition to the Moscow format uniting all neighbouring countries (China, Iran and the whole of Central Asia), the trilateral discussions of Russia, China and the US, attended to by special representatives, have also been very useful. I believe that this is a good example for other situations. It is no use trying to decide the fate of this or that country single-handedly, it is vital to look for collective formats to support unification processes.
When NATO all of a sudden started trying to draw Montenegro and Macedonia into the alliance, they shamelessly took advantage of the situation with the country’s name. The referendum in Macedonia was organised in a flagrant violation of the Constitution, which in Macedonia requires that only one question is put to a referendum, while they put three: Are you for EU membership, NATO membership, and are you prepared to change the country’s name for this? A fraudulent question altogether.
It was dishonest to accuse us of trying to oppose this referendum. The only thing we drew public attention to was the need to observe the Macedonian Constitution, according to which the ministers had no right to sign the Prespa agreement. This is for the president to do, and President Gjorge Ivanov outlined his position against this process very clearly. He was simply ignored, which was a gross violation of the Macedonian Constitution. And our Western colleagues, including NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini who visited Skopje, all said that people must say “yes, yes, yes” at the referendum.
Now that Montenegro has become a NATO member and Macedonia is being dragged into it, I am convinced that new military facilities will appear there. This will not make anyone happy. The military infrastructure is moving eastward again. These countries will be forced to spend money on US weapons and the situation in Europe will not become any calmer.
Question: What is Russia trying to achieve with its policy in Belarus? Many politicians in Minsk, including the President, think we are trying to deprive Belarus of its independence. Are these apprehensions justified?
Sergey Lavrov: Needless to say, these apprehensions are not justified. We cannot take this position as regards the fraternal Belarusian people. We are not trying to achieve anything in this respect. We want the aspirations of Russians and Belarusians, which were embodied in the Union Treaty, to be implemented in practice. If attitudes in our societies require some additional steps to be taken, we are ready for this. Following the meetings with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko several times at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, President of Russia Vladimir Putin instructed the experts to consider the future development of our integration processes and establish what adjustments need to be made to the Union Treaty in either direction. This work is now ongoing. We have an approved document – Priority Areas and Primary Tasks for the Development of the Union State in 2018-2022. It deals with a very simple task – to even out the conditions for economic cooperation and for average citizens. For example, the cost of resort treatments for its own citizens and for foreigners is different in Belarus. Now it is being levelled out under the Union Treaty. Similar efforts are being made to make people feel the same in either Russia or Belarus. This is probably the main criterion for the unity of our countries.
Question: Russia is not prepared to give up an inch of its land. Japan is not willing to give up its demand for the return of the disputed islands. Aren’t attempts to sign a peace treaty between the two countries just a waste of time?
Sergey Lavrov: It is always necessary to talk when a neighbour – and Japan is a very important neighbour – wants to move forward on an issue that you have diametrically opposed views of. We are trying to use an argument that I consider indisputable. I am convinced that any new agreements should be discussed on the basis of respect for the UN Charter that fixed, as immutable, the results of World War II. This is where the stumbling block is. This is an indispensable first step in the work on the peace treaty as the Japanese call it (we’d give it a broader name), but our Japanese colleagues flatly refuse to recognise this.
As for the peace treaty as such, my repeated talks with Foreign Minister of Japan Taro Kono, talks between the groups headed by our deputies as well as top-level meetings show that, as the Japanese see it, this treaty should consist of two lines: the border runs here, and everything will be fine from now on.
We think this formula was good for an agreement on the morning after the end of a war. Now that our relations have become more mature, embracing the economy and investment, as well as broad and intensive humanitarian and cultural contacts, we think we should develop a larger treaty that determines new goals for developing our cooperation, turning it into a strategic partnership and adding a new dimension to our economic, investment and humanitarian relations and, last but not least, to our foreign policy cooperation. Japan does not vote differently from the US on a single issue on which the positions of Russia and the West differ. You know about the US military presence on Japanese territory and the existence of the union treaty on their military-political alliance. Obviously, Japan is one of the closest if not the closest US ally in this region. US policy is openly anti-Russian and this is a fact. Considering these two facts, it seems premature to say that our relations are at a point where these complicated issues can be resolved.
Question: Have you seen any grounds for optimism in the results of the first round of the presidential election in Ukraine?
Sergey Lavrov: To be honest, I haven’t seen any grounds for either optimism or pessimism. What’s the point of guesswork? This is a process that should take place and will be completed. I do not doubt this or that the West will recognise this election.
OSCE observers released their preliminary report on the results of the first round of the presidential election, which abounds in examples of flagrant violations: corruption, bribery, pressure on voters and many other things. However, all this is described in a neutral tone. I think if they wrote about us, they would present these facts emotionally. Now they are doing it in an understated way and conclude that this did not affect the legitimacy of the election. Neither was it affected by the flagrant violation of OSCE rules when our observers were kicked out and over three million Ukrainians working and living in Russia were deprived of the right to vote. These are facts of life in Ukraine.
I think that the results of the election and the way it was organised came as no surprise to those who have been following domestic developments in Ukraine and its external ties. They are already calling each other puppets… It’s probably interesting to watch from the side but I don’t think that Ukrainian citizens are happy about this kind of democracy.
Question: Are the prospects of Russia-Ukraine cooperation still vague?
Sergey Lavrov: We are open to dialogue if the aim is not chatting and looking for excuses to do nothing but rather the practical implementation of the Minsk agreements. I have no doubt that Petr Poroshenko does not want to do this and won’t do this. When Viktor Medvedchuk just suggested seriously discussing what autonomous rights may be granted to Donbass, he was called a traitor. Poroshenko said this will never happen although he himself signed a document on the special status of Donbass, which is described with sufficient detail in the Minsk agreements.
These provisions on what rights Donbass should have were formulated by German Chancellor Angela Merkel personally, among others, but her ward has got out of hand. This is a fact. On the one hand, he doesn’t listen to Germany or France because he has American “patrons”. On the other hand, they find it embarrassing to pressure him in public because by doing so they will admit that what they call their “mediation” has failed.
However, there is no other document except for the Minsk agreements. They can certainly be supplemented. For instance, it is possible to provide OSCE observers with UN armed guards, as we suggest in response to the apprehensions of Ukrainians about their safety. But the core of these agreements must remain unchanged. The main point is that all issues are settled directly between Kiev, Donetsk and Lugansk.
Question: I really don’t like how America is now trying to carry out regime change in Venezuela by crudely exerting pressure. But does the government of that country deserve our support? It took a lot of effort to reduce the economy of such a rich country to its current state.
Sergey Lavrov: I agree with your view on the socio-economic situation in Venezuela. Honestly, we have been trying to impress on our Venezuelan colleagues that they need to carry out reforms. Special consultations were held at their request. There is no lack of relevant recommendations. Having said this, I must say that we don’t accept the methods by which the US is trying to improve the life of the Venezuelan people. This is arrogant, great power behaviour. This deliberate anything-goes policy is not limited to Venezuela. Nicaragua and Cuba are said to be next in line, so this may happen to any other country whose regime or government is disliked by Washington. What about coarse statements to the effect that countries beyond the Western Hemisphere should not have any interests there? And what is the US doing? Look at the map of its military bases and you will see that the whole world is dotted with them. Meanwhile, each of them poses serious risks.
Whether we like the Maduro Government or not is not the point. The foundations of international law are being shattered, which creates a situation that does not encourage development or predictability. It encourages an anything-goes policy and may tempt the US (and maybe others as well) to conduct such experiments on countries in any part of the world.
Question: Last time when we tried to save a friendly regime from the danger of a US attack in Latin America, it ended in the Cuban missile crisis. Are we in danger of something similar this time?
Sergey Lavrov: I don’t think there will be a repeat of the Cuban missile crisis. Even those countries that came together in the so-called Lima Group, insisting that the solution to the Venezuelan crisis can only be President Nicolas Maduro’s departure and an early election, really stiffened up when the US started saying that all options are “on the table,” hinting at a military invasion. I can guarantee that in the event of an attempted military invasion, an overwhelming majority of Latin American countries will immediately come out in categorical opposition.
Ultimately, Venezuela must choose its path of development itself. The fact that Nicolas Maduro, in response to the appeal of Mexico, Uruguay and Caribbean Community countries, agreed to talks with Juan Guaido and his team, while Juan Guaido flatly refused to accept the intermediaries’ appeal, speaks volumes. The US does not want to see a national consensus in Venezuela. It wants its protégé to be in power there to do everything he is told, first of all, concerning oil.
Question: What are Russian military doing in Venezuela, though? Are we not trying to create a second Syria there?
Sergey Lavrov: Not at all. We spoke publicly about this and we have nothing to hide. There is an agreement that we signed with Hugo Chavez in 2001. It was ratified by the national parliament, so it is completely legal and conforms with the Venezuelan Constitution. Under this agreement, we gave Venezuela defence equipment which needs servicing. It is time for regular servicing and nothing more.
Question: Recently they showed two sports nutrition sellers on Russian television who reported they went to Salisbury to see the cathedral. Did you trust these people?
Sergey Lavrov: I think it is necessary to figure this out. If they said they went where they were photographed it means that they were there. If they did something improper as our British colleagues say, then let them also show us photos where they are exposed in some criminal activity rather than just simply walking on the embankment. Only lazy people wouldn’t scoff at the phrase “highly likely.” This is indeed ridiculous. But at the same time it’s also dangerous because a similar approach has started to be used in international organisations.
We spoke about the chemical issue. The Salisbury case is based on the premise that Sergey and Yulia Skripal were poisoned, then a policeman was poisoned and cured, and a month later some woman with no fixed address died having found the same perfume bottle. This is a mystery.
London’s numeral refusals to accept our proposals to use the agreements signed between us to cooperate and study the facts cast serious doubts as to how all this happened. Not to mention the fact that neither Sergey nor Yulia are presented to the public. Leaks about the sale of her flat appear from time to time.
As for chemical agents, there is the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction (Chemical Weapons Convention or CWC). This is under the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). The convention is based on consensus.
Following a UN Security Council decision, the OPCW established, in cooperation with the UN, a group to investigate an incident in Syria. Such phrases like “highly likely”, ‘”there are grounds to believe”, “there seems to be no other option”, etc. are very apparent in this group’s report. Recently another report was released. It was compiled by OPCW representatives themselves because the UN Security Council disbanded the joint group that discredited itself with the aforementioned report. Now, in violation of the principle of consensus on which the CWC is based, a minority of participant countries voted for the creation of an auxiliary body in the OPCW Technical Secretariat with the illegal mandate to determine those who are responsible. They released yet another regular report on what happened in Douma, Syria. It contains over 20 references with phrases like “highly likely” and not a single assertion.
Incidentally, we know for sure that this report was subject to alteration. Here is a specific example. In the initial version the report said that two barrels with chlorine were found. They were presented by these experts, or by those who wanted to expose the Syrian regime, with evidence that chemical agents were dropped from the air. One of them was in a room with a broken roof. The hole was the size of the barrel but it was lying on a bed and a blanket and pillows were in place. The initial version said it was likely that these barrels were brought from the street by hand, whereas the final version said that they were most likely dropped by a helicopter. There is no need to prove anything in this case.
Question: Is the war in Syria over or not? Is it possible that we will become bogged down in that country’s affairs for decades to come?
Sergey Lavrov: No, the war is not over. We must completely eliminate the hotbeds of terrorism. A very disturbing one is Idlib where several thousand terrorists still remain, including individuals from former Soviet republics and Russia as well. We are engaged in serious efforts with Turkey and Bashar al-Assad’s government there. Our military experts are in regular contact about this. Jabhat al-Nusra terrorists have set up a new structure with a new name there and are trying to take over all other armed groups, including those that are considered to be moderate and open to dialogue with the government. This has not been a smooth process and now, finally, Russian and Turkish forces have started joint patrols of some areas in the Idlib security zone.
The second hotbed is on the east bank of the Euphrates. About a thousand terrorists are in captivity there guarded by Kurds who are working with the Americans. Most of them are West European citizens who were naturalised there in the past. It is very alarming that their countries of citizenship do not want to accept them and intend to strip them of their citizenship, while the US has announced that if those people are not taken back by their countries, they will just be released. This means that cooperation on terrorism, sadly, is not comprehensive. Every country behaves selfishly in such situations. Speaking at the UN in 2015, President Vladimir Putin suggested setting up a truly global, universal front to combat terrorism, and this remains an essential goal.
We have resumed our counter-terrorism dialogue with the US following a long period where it attempted to avoid this. We are also restoring dialogue with the EU and, as a specific proposal, we are promoting the idea of their joining the Federal Security Service databank which accumulates information about all movements of the so-called foreign terrorist fighters. Such persons can fight in Syria, then leave that country under pressure from government troops and allies, and later can resurface in Malaysia or Indonesia. It is very important to download information about such people, so as to rapidly track where they have disappeared to. We are certainly against their return to the Russian Federation.
Question: Based on a summary of US Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report published by the United States Department of Justice, it allegedly contains definitive proof of our interference in US political processes. What will be our response when the report is published in full?
Sergey Lavrov: Depends on what is written there.
We offered to cooperate long ago, on the basis of suspicions that they can back up with facts. Beyond that, we had and have now an organisation called the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centre. Both they and we have such a round-the-clock centre in the event someone suspects something nefarious. When at the end of the summer and beginning of the autumn of 2016, accusations began coming out that we were interfering in the US election campaign, we suggested that the US should send these anonymously voiced suspicions to us through the channels of that centre, which is a very reliable, professional channel. The US refused. Later we suggested this again several times. Correspondence on cyber threats from Russia, hacking and suchlike continued from September 2016 until January 2017, that is during the entire remainder of Barack Obama’s administration. When they started to hysterically accuse us even before the report came out, we suggested publishing this correspondence honestly and professionally for people to know our response to all this. They refused. As decent guys, we cannot do this alone, but we warned them that we would reveal the fact that they refused to publish this correspondence.
Question: There is an opinion that only those who do nothing that make no mistakes.
Sergey Lavrov: Petro Poroshenko said that.
Question: Does it mean you do not agree?
Sergey Lavrov : Why not? I agree.
Question : If you agree, can you tell us about the biggest mistakes in the Russian foreign policy of the past few years?
Sergey Lavrov : If you ask me about the biggest achievements, I will not tell you anything either. I will let the people decide. There is a saying: we learn from past mistakes. This is true. I will not tell you what past mistakes we have learned from in the past years while I have been foreign minister so as not to give away certain things to our partners whose views we contest.
Question : Last month, it was 15 years since your appointment as foreign minister. Which days in this position were the most challenging for you?
Sergey Lavrov : Every day is a challenge. Of course, experience matters. Any person in any position will first look around and try to understand the best way to organise the work. To a certain extent, I was lucky: President Vladimir Putin offered me this post when I was Russia’s Permanent Representative to the UN, where we dealt with the entire international agenda one way or another. I had a certain degree of experience and was ready to engage with my colleagues. In New York, I had talks and confidential conversations, gave and received information on a daily basis. But, of course, the responsibility at the ministerial level is completely different. I receive certain directives from the President, but on many issues I have to make decisions on the go. This is a responsibility. I really do not want to ever lose this feeling of responsibility.
Question: Are you getting tired of this burden of responsibility?
Sergey Lavrov: The work is very interesting. I can’t complain.

Shooting In Kazan. Why Many Russians Do Not Believe Police,www.therussophile.org,JJsd95,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/shooting-in-kazan-why-many-russians-do-not-believe-police.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
southfront.org Donate A screenshot from the video
On April 4, a video of shooting incident in the Russian city of Kazan. The video was reportedly filmed on March 1 during some wedding celebrations.
Mariya Kiyamutdinova, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Kazan, stressed that that authorities have carried out a preliminary investigation and identified persons involved. However, she stressed, no criminal case has been opened because the shoorter used “an wind gun [air gun] and blank cartridge”. This statement remains unclear.
The video circulating online clearly shows that the man was using a semi-automatic firearm, intert or regular.
The weapon can be air or inert. Even if the filmed person used blank rounds, in the framework of the Russian legal practice such situations are being treated under Article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation – “hooliganism” [up to 5 years in prison]. Just recently, Article 213 was used in the city of Surgut in the framework of the case opened over a shooting incident during a weeding .
Furthermore, it should be noted that the person involved in the March 1 incident was shoting towards the Kazan Kremlin , the chief historic citadel of the Republic of Tatarstan. The video also allows to see that the person was aiming his weapon at some administrative building there. The residency of the head of Tatarstan is located in the Kazan Kremlin.
The video also allows to hear reactions of some people behind the cadre. It’s highly possible that these are friends of the shooter. It’s highly possible that the shooter was demonstrating his flagrant disregard towrads official bodies to his friends. Taking into account these factors, the official reaction of the authorities over this incident, especially comments regarding “blank rounds” and “an air rifle”, set people wondering.
There is also a version that the March 1 incident was a pre-planned provocation. Some people “asked” the shooter to fire towards the Kazan Kremlin. It is visible that the person was holding the weapon and shooting clumsily. Most likely, the gun was not belonging to him.
In this case, the possible goal of the provocation was to publicly discredit regional or (and) federal authorities and trigger a massive public outcry amid the conflcit between the regional elites and the federal authorities. The provocative statement by the local spokesperson for the Ministry of Internal Affairs could be viewed as a signal in the favor of this version.
For our part, we think that the this version is less likely that the main one. Most likely, this was an ordrinary hooliganism.

Assange Arrest Imminent: Ecuadorian Embassy To Expel Him In “Hours To Days”,www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/assange-arrest-imminent-ecuadorian-embassy-to-expel-him-in-hours-to-days.html/,"Authored by Wayne Madsen via The Strategic Culture Foundation:
With more than a “wink and a nod” from their collegial “caudillo del Norte,” Donald Trump, seven right-wing South American leaders have launched the Forum for the Progress of South America (PROSUR), which aims to eradicate all vestiges of Venezuela’s late president, Hugo Chavez, and Brazil’s wrongfully-imprisoned past president, Inacio Lula da Silva. PROSUR seeks to replace the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which was created by Chavez and Lula in 208 to counteract traditional American hegemonism in Latin America enforced by the neo-colonial Organization of American States (OAS).
Leaders from seven right-wing South American governments – Chile, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Paraguay, Ecuador, Peru, and Guyana – recently gathered in Santiago, Chile, under the auspices of billionaire Chilean president Sebastian Pinera, to sign an accord creating PROSUR. One of the goals of the new bloc is to integrate the defense, security, and crime prevention infrastructures of the members. If that sounds like an embryonic recreation of the infamous Operation CONDOR of the 1960s and 70s, it very much has such potential. CONDOR was an alliance of the intelligence and security services of South American military dictatorships, nurtured by the CIA, that is believed to have been responsible for 60,000 murders, 30,000 “disappeared,” 400,000 wrongful imprisonments, and countless acts of torture.
Bolivia and Uruguay, members of UNASUR that support Chavez’s successor, Nicolas Maduro, against the Central Intelligence Agency-groomed and -installed presidential pretender, Juan Guaido, did not join PROSUR, and, instead, elected observer status in the group.
Pinera and Colombia’s right-wing and narco/paramilitary-backed president, Ivan Duque, were the architects behind PROSUR. Seeing a chance to bury the legacies of Chavez and Lula, the two presidents invited all but Maduro’s government to join the pact.
Ecuador, which joined PROSUR, served as the headquarters of UNASUR. In 2014, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa opened the $65 million headquarters in Quito. Today, with right-wing governments and, as with the cases of Brazil and Colombia, far-right wing governments, taking over most of South America, the UNASUR headquarters sits largely abandoned. Moreno ordered UNASUR to abandon the building and promised to turn it into a university. After UNASUR Secretary General Ernesto Samper left his post in 2017, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Paraguay, and Peru suspended their membership in the bloc, dealing it a fatal blow.
Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno quickly abandoned his commitment to the ideals of Correa, Lula, and Chavez and embraced the caudillo politics of the right-wing South America presidents. Moreno, whose first name is in honor of Vladimir Lenin, plunged a knife into UNASUR when he said it was the creation of “perverse politicking of the self-styled 21st-century socialists.” After Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Paraguay, and Peru withdrew from UNASUR, with the obvious prodding of the Trump administration, the stage was set for creating a new right-wing and pro-US alliance of neo-fascists, grifters, and oligarchs.
Moreno, who served as Correa’s vice president, has abandoned the socialist policies of his predecessor. Moreno not only welcomed US Vice President Mike Pence to Ecuador with open arms but sought the re-opening of the former US intelligence airbase at Manta, which had been closed by Correa in 2009. Moreno’s defense minister announced that what would replace the Manta airbase would be a “Security Cooperation Office.” In 2018, Moreno withdrew Ecuador from one of Chavez’s most-prized creations, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA).
Ironically, Moreno, who bears the first name of the founder of the world’s first Communist nation, reversed many of Correa’s policies aimed at reducing the influence of Ecuador’s oligarchs and banks. Correa, who now lives in exile in Belgium, faces imprisonment in Ecuador in a political jihad launched by Moreno that is not unlike that of the Brazilian right-wing that targeted Lula and his successor, Dilma Rousseff. Present at the inauguration of PROSUR in Santiago was Argentine president Mauricio Macri, the one-time business partner of Donald Trump, who has done everything possible to imprison his predecessor, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. Now an Argentine senator, Kirchner and her husband, the late President Nestor Kirchner, were partners of Chavez, Lula, and Correa in creating UNASUR.
Uruguyan president Tabaré Vázquez, who sent an observer delegation to PROSUR’s inaugural summit in Chile without joining the group, criticized the new group at a United Nations conference in Buenos Aires. Vázquez said that South America already had regional organizations, including the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR), the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELADE), and the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI). However, like Moreno of Ecuador, Vázquez criticized the creation of UNASUR, saying, it “had a certain political ideology.”
Presidents Mario Abdo Benitez of Paraguay Martin Vizcarra of Peru have also steered their countries firmly into the right-wing camp. Both presidents joined their colleagues in Santiago for the PROSUR summit.
One surprise leader who signed on to PROSUR in Santiago was David Granger, the president of Guyana. Granger, as a former Brigadier General in the Guyana Defense Force, likely felt at home with individuals like Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, a former Brazilian paratrooper whose spoken Brazilian Portuguese reflects that of an uncouth Army veteran combined with a street thug. Granger has made common cause with ExxonMobil to lay claim to oil reserves in Guyana’s Exclusive Economic Zone, which are also claimed by Venezuela. Granger has brandished his right-wing allegiances by ignoring Guyana’s Constitution and postponing a March 19, 2019 required election to 2020. It was the defection of Granger’s coalition government’s parliamentary backbencher, Charrandas Persaud, to the opposition in a no-confidence vote that originally triggered the election. Rather than comply with the Constitution, Granger’s government, accused Persaud of being a US citizen, not eligible to sit in parliament. Persaud also received death threats. Yet, according to the Western corporate media, Guyana is being threatened by an “undemocratic” Maduro government in Venezuela.
Just as PROSUR seeks to eliminate the vestiges of Chavez, Lula, Correa, and Kirchner in South America, there has been an attempt by Washington to also wipe out two other Chavez regional projects, ALBA and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). Both organizations include Venezuela’s allies in the Caribbean region. Trump recently invited the leaders of five Caribbean nations – Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and Saint Lucia – to his Mar-a-Lago billionaires’ club in Palm Beach to seek their commitment to isolate the Maduro government of Venezuela and support the Guaido puppet regime. In order to entice the leaders to sever all financial links with Venezuela, including their participation in the PetroCaribe program that provided them with subsidized Venezuelan gasoline and oil, Trump offered nebulous loan guarantees through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), a Wall Street contrivance with major national debt pitfalls attached.
Trump has a major real estate project in the Dominican Republic. Allen Chastanet, the prime minister of Saint Lucia, is the incoming chairman of the Caribbean Community. He will be expected to wean away from Venezuela its last remaining allies in the organization.
Trump and his team of neocons, including national security adviser John Bolton and Venezuela regime change envoy Elliott Abrams, who was convicted in the Iran-Contra scandal and who benefited from a cover-up bolstered by Attorney General William Barr, will now concentrate their efforts on overthrowing Maduro and subjecting his last remaining allies, Mexico, Nicaragua, Cuba, Bolivia, Uruguay, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada to regime change operations.

Be Ready To Act: WikiLeaks Source Says They’re Coming For Assange,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/be-ready-to-act-wikileaks-source-says-theyre-coming-for-assange-2.html/,"This post was originally published on this site https://steemitimages.com/640x480/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbjeiaE1VDhNw3e5kNEmNFJG26RVK8wxoQ72tNaz3F43J/image.png
The WikiLeaks Twitter account has announced that it has high level information that the organization’s founder Julian Assange could have his political asylum the Ecuadorian embassy revoked for him to be arrested by the British government within hours. We need to be ready to shake the earth should this happen. We need all hands on deck for this one.
“BREAKING: A high level source within the Ecuadorian state has told @WikiLeaks that Julian Assange will be expelled within ‘hours to days’ using the #INApapers offshore scandal as a pretext–and that it already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest,” the leak publishing outlet tweeted , with a link to a story about the INA Papers leak.
The pretext that is being used is almost irrelevant, because it has nothing to do with truth or reality. Assange has been a target of the US-centralized power establishment ever since WikiLeaks began publishing authentic documents exposing the malfeasance of its leaders a decade ago, and strings are being pulled around the world to funnel him into its jaws. That’s all that this is, but it should surprise no one that the pretext is bogus as well. Journalist Elizabeth Vos wrote an article for Consortium News the other day summarizing the false narrative being spun by the Ecuadorian government that the conditions of asylum have been violated by the WikiLeaks account (not Assange) tweeting about a scandal that has rocked Ecuador’s president Lenin Moreno.
To be clear, it is a known fact that the US government is working to arrest and imprison Assange, not for the Russia stuff that has had establishment loyalists so excited over the last couple of years, but for the 2010 leaks exposing US war crimes. The US has an extradition treaty with the UK, and the British government has refused to comment on whether or not it has received an extradition request for the Assange arrest that we absolutely know for a fact is an existing US government agenda. This would be the same US government which tortured Chelsea Manning after refusing her a fair trial .
If Assange is arrested and prosecuted under the Patriot Act, it will be a devastating blow to press freedoms and constitute a greater leap in the direction of Orwellian dystopia than the Patriot Act did. The US government exercising the ability to imprison journalists for simply publishing facts about it, not just in America but anywhere in the world, will be a poisoned dagger in the heart of the world population’s ability to bring any transparency or accountability to that titanic power structure.
“WikiLeaks reports that Julian Assange is on the verge of being expelled from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London,” tweeted the legendary journalist John Pilger in response to today’s news. “Please fill the street outside the embassy and protect him, and show solidarity with a courageous man, whose struggle ought to touch us all.”
Yes please.
We are about to find out if this is the part of the movie where the empire rips off the mask of freedom and democracy and reveals its true tyranny. Assange is a soft target, a controversial figure who has been on the receiving end of wildly successful smear campaigns marketed to every major political faction across the western world. He is the logical place to begin a crackdown on press freedoms and make a public example of what happens to those who shine the light of truth upon Big Brother.
If we allow them to imprison Julian Assange for practicing journalism, that’s it. It’s over. We might as well all stop caring what happens to the world and sit on our hands while the oligarchs drive us to ecological disaster, nuclear annihilation or Orwellian dystopia. If we, the many, don’t have the spine to stand up against the few and say “No, we get to find out facts about you bastards and use it to inform our worldview, you don’t get to criminalize that,” then we certainly don’t have the spine it will take to wrest control of this world away from the hands of sociopathic plutocrats and take our fate into our own hands.
The arrest of Julian Assange would be the fork in the road. It would be where we collectively decide as a species whether we want to survive into the future, and if we deserve to.
So be ready to shake the earth if they decide that this is a good time to sink their talons into him. If they touch one silver hair on that man’s head, we must unleash relentless worldwide outrage the likes of which they have never before seen.Because we’re not just fighting for Assange, we’re fighting for our very survival.
Jeremy Corbyn has spoken out in defense of WikiLeaks and Assange in the past. His moral character combined with his continual rise toward the leadership of the British government may partly explain the rush to arrest Assange as quickly as possible. In what was in my opinion one of the most exciting occurrences in wester politics recently, Corbyn read an excerpt from Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “The Masque of Anarchy” before an audience of thousands at the 2017 Glastonbury festival.
Corbyn roared:
“Rise, like lions after slumber In unvanquishable number! Shake your chains to earth like dew Which in sleep had fallen on you: Ye are many — they are few!”
If Assange is arrested, that will be our cue to rise like lions from our slumber, which has gone on far too long at far too great a cost. We cannot permit them to use, exploit and oppress us like this anymore. We are the many. They are the few. Be ready to rise."
Fake News Tsunami – Trump's 'Collusion' And Corbyn As 'Dangerous Hero',www.therussophile.org,editor@medialens.org Editor,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/fake-news-tsunami-trumps-collusion-and-corbyn-as-dangerous-hero.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
According to corporate journalism, a tidal wave of ‘fake news’ has long been threatening to swamp their wonderful work reporting real news. The ProQuest media database finds fully 805,669 hits for newspaper articles mentioning the term ‘fake news’. The key sources of such fakery are said to be social media, and above all, of course, Russia.
It is a perfect irony, then, that ‘ the Mueller report ‘, conducted by the US Department of Justice Special Counsel’s Office, headed by former FBI Director Robert Mueller, ‘did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities’.
Jeremy Scahill of The Intercept explains the significance:
‘This has been an utterly colossal media failure and it reveals how little things have actually changed with the broader press since the Iraq War lies. The overall tone of much of the reporting on this Trump-Russia story has started from the position that the intelligence community was being truthful about Trump and Russia. The reporting then sought to further confirm those assertions. It was confirmation bias to the nth degree…
‘Also, the fact that Trump is a cartoonish buffoonish villain contributed to an atmosphere where the attitude was that anything Trump was accused of—no matter how insane it sounded—was totally plausible, if not likely, if not certain to have happened. Trump was not supposed to win. It was Hillary Clinton’s turn.’
As we will discuss below, this should ring loud bells with British readers subjected to a very similar smear campaign targeting Jeremy Corbyn, who was also ‘not supposed to win’ the Labour Party election leadership.
In 2017, a Guardian leading article commented on Trump and Russia:
‘The Guardian view of Trump’s Russia links: a lot to go at.’
Another leader in 2017 went much further:
‘Meanwhile the grenades he [Trump] lobs via Twitter or interview cloud the issue that still lies at the heart of his presidency: Russian meddling in the US election, and the possible collusion of his own campaign. All other iniquities pale beside this.’
Also in the Guardian in 2017, columnist Paul Mason highlighted ‘Kremlin involvement in the Trump campaign’ as the key reason ‘Trump could be out of office within a year’.
The Telegraph agreed that the ‘russiagate’ claim ‘is the cloud hanging over the entire presidency’.
The press has been filled with numerous similar examples.
Strongly echoing UK experience, Scahill adds:
‘We have been subjected to more than two years of nonstop, fact-free assertions and wild theories masquerading as fact, masquerading as insightful analysis.’
A tsunami of ‘fake news’, in other words, supplied by the very same media who have supplied that other tsunami of warnings on the threat of ‘fake news’.
The key word, and the title of Guardian journalist Luke Harding’s best-selling book: ‘Collusion’ . The rest of the book title, unfortunately for Harding: ‘How Russia Helped Trump Win the White House’ (Guardian Faber Publishing; Main, 2017).
Harding was also lead author of a fake, front-page Guardian claim in November 2018 that Paul Manafort, Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, had met Julian Assange three times in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Both Harding and Guardian editor Kath Viner have refused to respond to challenges posed , for example, by former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald. Needless to say, our questions were also ignored. Tom Bower’s ‘Farrago Of Falsehood And Insinuation’
As discussed, Scahill’s ‘years of nonstop, fact-free assertions and wild theories masquerading as fact’ also describes UK attacks on Corbyn. In an article for Middle East Eye, journalist Peter Oborne carefully examined a high-profile example supplied by investigative journalist Tom Bower’s book, ‘Dangerous Hero – Corbyn’s Ruthless Plot For Power’ .
The title of Oborne’s piece:
‘Jeremy Corbyn and the truth about Tom Bower’s book – A biography about the Labour leader systematically distorts the truth, writes Peter Oborne.’
By contrast, the Amazon entry for Bower’s book features these impressive comments:
‘THE BOOK EVERY VOTER MUST READ’ Mail on Sunday
‘Meticulous and highly readable … Funny and devastating’ Daily Telegraph
‘The most compelling in-depth study so far’ Guardian
No surprise, then, that the book features in prominent, shop-front and multiple other in-store displays in bookshops like Waterstones and Foyles.
In the Independent, former editor Chris Blackhurst wrote:
‘Reading Tom Bower’s insightful new biography… I was reminded of his [Corbyn’s] isolation and single-mindedness.’
Blackhurst continued:
‘Reading Bower, you’re left in no doubt that Corbyn wants to turn the clock back, that his solution to those problematic examples and awkward developments that upset his path is merely to ignore them. This makes him very dangerous indeed, hard to reason with, oblivious to criticism and set in his ways. It’s a troubling account, one that should give every entrepreneur pause and anyone who works in business pause.’
Writing in the Telegraph, Tom Harris gave four out of five stars to Bower’s ‘devastating account of Corbyn’s rise to the top’. Harris wrote:
‘Bower’s meticulous and highly readable account must be absorbed from start to finish’ [and was] ‘Funny and devastating’.
In the Sunday Times, Dominic Sandbrook, praised ‘a forensically detailed portrait of a man with no inner life, a monomaniac suffused with an overwhelming sense of his own righteousness…’
ProQuest finds no less than 22 hits for articles mentioning Bower and his book in the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday. In the latter, historian Andrew Roberts welcomed the paper’s ‘serialisation of Tom Bower’s searing biography of Corbyn’. Roberts wrote:
‘Today’s extract from Bower’s book charts how anti-Zionism became a near-obsession for Corbyn since his early days as a trades union researcher, leading him to believe in what Bower describes as “the malign collective power of Jews”.’
The book ‘made clear’ that Corbyn ‘has adopted a Leninist blueprint for taking and controlling power at Westminster, while playing the “nice guy”.’
Oborne, on the other hand, took such a dim view of the book that he felt obliged to remind readers of the whole ethical basis of political journalism:
‘Those of us who report on politics are at liberty to express, within limits, whatever opinions we like. These limits include an obligation to observe standards. We should strive to be accurate. We can make strong arguments but ought not to distort the truth or suppress relevant information to make our point.
‘Writer Tom Bower fails catastrophically to meet these standards. It is not only that Dangerous Hero: Corbyn’s Ruthless Plot For Power , his new book on Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, contains numerous falsehoods. It systematically omits relevant facts in order to portray Corbyn as a ruthless Marxist and anti-semite hell-bent on destroying Western liberal values.’
Oborne continued:
‘The ugly truth is that Bower is not straight with his readers, let alone Corbyn.
‘Again and again he withholds relevant information, with the result that the Labour leader and his colleagues come over in the worst possible light.’
Oborne provided numerous examples in his long, careful analysis. For example:
‘Bower makes much of a confrontation between Labour activist Marc Wadsworth and Labour MP Ruth Smeeth at the launch for Shami Chakrabarti’s report on anti-semitism in June 2016. He writes that “Wadsworth snapped at her that not only was she ‘working hand-in-hand’ with the right-wing media by speaking to the journalist, but she was also a Jew”.
‘The brief incident is recorded on video. I have examined this video. Nowhere in the footage does Wadsworth say that Smeeth is Jewish. I spoke to two eyewitnesses to this event, both of whom confirmed to me that at no point did Wadsworth say that Smeeth was Jewish.’
Bower’s book contains a really extraordinary claim against Corbyn’s press officer, former Guardian comment editor Seumas Milne, describing his behaviour after the arrival of members of the Board of Deputies of British Jews in Corbyn’s office:
‘In the presence of Jews, his body language had visibly changed.’
Oborne noted that no evidence or source was provided to justify this accusation, which depicts Milne as an authentically Nazi-style Jew-hater. Oborne responded, to devastating effect, citing journalist David Hearst:
“‘I sat for a number of years opposite Seumas,’ he told me. ‘I am Jewish, as are a number of my former colleagues on The Guardian. At no time did any of us sense that Seumas’s body language changed in our presence.
“‘He was part of the team, held in high regard for his knowledge of the Middle East and often consulted on it, particularly by the person who sat next to him, fellow columnist Jonathan Freedland. That opinion of Seumas was shared by our editor at the time, Alan Rusbridger, who kept him as comment editor for six years.'”
Bower’s response to Oborne’s critique?
‘During the last 36 hours, I have made numerous attempts to make contact with Tom Bower in order to give him the chance to defend himself. I’ve contacted him by mobile phone, by text message and at his direct line at his London home. No answer. I also emailed a list of questions to Bower yesterday morning, both to his private email address and to his publicist at William Collins. He has not responded to me.’
Oborne has since told us that Bower never responded to his questions (Twitter, direct message, March 28). He continued:
‘Bower has made an astonishing number of factual errors – more than I have ever come across in a book from a mainstream publisher. While something has clearly gone horribly wrong with the editing process at William Collins, Bower is the author and must take full responsibility…
‘Time after time, Bower makes assertions that are not backed by any evidence. The problem is so bad that I resolved to carry out my own investigation into the truth of some of the assertions made in Bower’s book. This article is the result of my research. Again and again, I have been able to prove that his account of events is false, misleading and, in some cases, pure fabrication.’
Oborne added:
‘Bower’s book is not just intellectually dishonest, it is a farrago of falsehood and insinuation.
‘Yet it appears to have had no difficulty finding a mainstream publisher, while receiving a generous reception in the mainstream press. To their credit a handful of reviewers – above all Stephen Bush in the Observer – have exposed some of the errors in this book. But even the Bush review hardly touches on the extent of the collapse of journalistic standards in Bower’s account of Corbyn.’
To his credit, the Guardian’s George Monbiot tweeted Oborne’s piece with high praise:
‘A brave and remarkable review’
A tweeter countered, noting that ‘similar nonsense comes from Guardian on a daily basis without regard to balance or fact’.
Monbiot replied :
‘Both the Guardian and the Observer slated the book.’
In fact, Guardian columnist and former political editor of the Observer, Gaby Hinsliff, concluded of Bower’s book in the Guardian:
‘This is the most compelling in-depth study so far of a man whose head is unusually difficult to get inside, given his suspicion of anyone who isn’t a fellow traveller. Just don’t expect it to change anyone’s mind.’
It is telling to compare Hinsliff’s most severe criticism with Oborne’s:
‘And that’s perhaps the biggest flaw in an otherwise damning book. Bower’s colours seem nailed to the mast…’
As Oborne says:
‘British journalists need to ask themselves a question. Is there something rotten in British media discourse which allows someone like Bower to get away with this?’
It is an important question. Celebrating ‘a farrago of falsehood’ titled ‘Dangerous Hero’ can have dangerous consequences. Last month, Corbyn was punched in the head by a protestor holding an egg (dismissed as an ‘egging’ by journalists) who was subsequently jailed for 28 days for the attack. This week, we learned that soldiers of the 3rd Battalion of the British Paratroop Regiment filmed themselves shooting at a picture of Corbyn.
This recalls the revelation, in 2015, that a senior serving general had warned that a government led by Corbyn could face ‘a mutiny’ from the army. The unnamed general told the Sunday Times:
‘The Army just wouldn’t stand for it. The general staff would not allow a prime minister to jeopardise the security of this country and I think people would use whatever means possible, fair or foul to prevent that. You can’t put a maverick in charge of a country’s security.’
Political and press criticism of Corbyn has always far exceeded the usual fierce disagreement, presenting him as a treacherous threat to national security, an anti-semitic fool who is ‘unfit’ to lead the country. He has been relentlessly presented as fundamentally unacceptable. As this alert was being written, Conservative MP Caroline Johnson warned in parliament that mismanaging Brexit risked ‘letting down the country and ushering in a Marxist, anti-semite-led government’. It is, in fact, astonishing to see how, in less than four years, politicians and journalists have turned an honest, compassionate, decent politician into a hate figure.
If ‘acceptable’ political choices are ultimately determined by the media, the government, or even by the military, we are well on the way to fascism.

US Exposes Indian Lies Over F-16 “Downing”,www.therussophile.org,Adam Garrie,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/us-exposes-indian-lies-over-f-16-downing.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Indian officials insist that they downed a Pakistani F-16 on 27 February, the same day during which Pakistan successfully downed an Indian MIG-21 before rescuing and tending to the pilot who has now been released back to India. It has now been over a month since India first made its F-16 claim and in that period, no hard evidence has been produced to back the initial claim.
Now, a report from the United States citing top American military officials has confirmed that all of Pakistan’s F-16s are accounted for. Given America’s pivot towards India, a country now viewed by Washington as a useful partner in the neo-Cold War against China, it is significant that India’s lie about the F-16 was so big that even an strategic partner could not play along with such utter fiction.
This itself helps to explain that while the US is actively courting India, the nature of contemporary Pakistan-US relations cannot be categorised through a zero-sum prism.
Last year was a nadir in Pakistan-US relations after Donald Trump brazenly accused Islamabad of creating a “safe haven” for radials. That being said, as Trump has a penchant for cutting “aid” and military subsidies to foreign partners, this defamatory statement might well have been little more than an excuse that was needed in order to convince the US “deep state” to cancel $300 million in “military aid” (more accurately called reparations) to Pakistan.
Since then, two major things have happened. First of all, as Trump remains determined to extricate his country from the blood-soaked quagmire in Afghanistan, many in the US including Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad have come to realise that Pakistan’s approach to Afghanistan had been right all along and that since 2001, the US has ultimately followed the failed model of the Soviet invasion of the 1980s. As such, the US now needs Pakistani assistance to help guide an all-parties peace process which will see a reformed Taliban formalise its powerful de facto role as Afghanistan’s most prominent political force.
Seeing as such a peace process is scarcely possible without Pakistan’s diplomatic assistance, the US is actively rolling back the anti-Pakistan sentiments of last year at the same time as peace talks between Washington and the Taliban intensify.
Secondly, recent acts of unprovoked Indian aggression against Pakistani territory in the aftermath of the Pulwama incident have made the US reconsider its position on India in one crucial respect. The US will continue to strengthen its partnership with India as a means of trying to provoke China, whilst the US will also attempt to groom India into a position of becoming less reliant on Russian weapons and more reliant on American ones. But what the US does not want is a new India-Pakistan war and as such, while the US (like most nations on the planet) does not care about civilian life in Kashmir, the US realises that as state sanctioned violence against Kashmiri civilians intensifies, the chances of a new war increase.
As such, while the US was clearly not entirely displeased with Premier Modi’s exploiting of the events in Pulwama as an election stunt, the US also appears to have realised that unless issued with strict marching orders, Modi will take things too far if given the chance. While the US still needs to keep up appearances in respect of playing into India’s perverse narrative on Kashmir, Washington could barely disguise how badly it was irked by Modi’s dangerous game of brinkmanship.
Many in the US appear to have been caught off guard by just how unhinged Modi actually is, but this is no longer the case. As such, the US will remain happy to keep Modi’s aggression tethered to a short leash, but Washington now realises that Modi could become a liability if the leash is not gripped tightly. For Donald Trump there was also a personal element to the disappointment in Modi’s antics as India’s failed “surgical strike 2.0” on Pakistan tended to overshadow his prominent meeting with Kim Jong-un in Hanoi.
Because of this, the US will likely become more active in minimising the potential for conflict between India and Pakistan, not least because any further attempts by India to destabilise Pakistan will clearly have an impact on US attempts to restore order to Afghanistan after 17 years of chaos.
In this sense, while clearly growing more favourable towards India and less so towards Pakistan, when it comes to reigning in the excesses of destabilising Indian aggression and outlandishly provocative lies, the US still seeks to balance relations between Islamabad and New Delhi in order to effectively keep the capricious Modi on what amounts to a short leash. To be sure, the US wants Modi to be its anti-China attack dog in the region, but Washington certainly does not want Modi to trigger a nuclear war with Pakistan by taking matters too far.
Against this background, it is not difficult to understand why Donald Trump said the following on Pakistan Day:
“We’ll be meeting with Pakistan [leadership]. I think our relationship right now is very good with Pakistan”.
While Trump is not likely to restore the $300 million in “aid” owing to his overall policy of wanting partners to pay the US for “protection”, the US leader has clearly come to see that the US needs Pakistan in order to bring stability to Afghanistan. Washington has also been able to see that Pakistan is important as a bulwark against Indian expansionism that would clearly run amok in the region if countries like the US, China and Russia weren’t there to put the brakes on the BJP’s aggressive agenda.
Finally, as Donald Trump tends to enjoy the presence of charismatic world leaders, especially those who present a challenge to the American status quo (Kim Jong-un and Trump’s self described “good friend” Xi Jinping to name but two examples), Trump may well come to both respect and even like Imran Khan on a human level.
Imran Khan has stood out from his predecessors as a leader who can clearly, forcefully and magnetically articulate Pakistan’s position to international audiences. This has certainly not been lost on Trump and as such, the sooner he and Imran Khan meet, the better it will be for all parties involved. Share this article"
Assad: What is going on in Venezuela is similar to Syria,www.therussophile.org,Murasel-En,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/assad-what-is-going-on-in-venezuela-is-similar-to-syria.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
On Apr 5, 2019 What is going on in Venezuela is similar to what happened in Syria and that aims at imposing hegemony on states and controlling their independent decision, which undermines the international law and contradicts the most important principles of the UN Charter i.e. the respect of states’ sovereignty and right of self-determination., Syrian President Bashar Assad told Venezuela’s Foreign Minister.
“ What is happening in Venezuela is similar to the developments in Syria, ” Bashar Assad told Jorge Arreaza during his visit to Damascus, as quoted by Russian media. Those interfering in both crises seek “hegemony” over Syria’s and Venezuela’s sovereignty, Assad claimed.
President Bashar al-Assad on Thursday received Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza and the accompanying delegation.
President al-Assad was briefed on the latest developments taking place in Venezuela by Minister Arreaza, as he expressed confidence that Caracas will overcome the crisis that it is currently facing and restore the state of stability soon enough.
For his part, Arreaza thanked President al-Assad for his supportive stance to Caracas with regards to overcoming its current crisis and stressed that the tools and steps used by the states, which are enemies of Venezuela, are similar to those used in Syria for igniting war in it, adding that what has happened to his country is an episode of a series of the US continuous attempts for decades to control the Venezuela’s independent decision and the Venezuelan people’s resources.
The meeting also dealt with the close relations binding Syria and Venezuela and the importance of going ahead in boosting them in a way that serves the interests of the two countries’ peoples.

Trump Administration Demands that Turkey Cancel Purchase of Russian S-400 Air Defense Missiles,www.therussophile.org,Stephen Lendman,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/trump-administration-demands-that-turkey-cancel-purchase-of-russian-s-400-air-defense-missiles.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
The Trump regime demands Turkey cancel its planned purchase of Russian S-400 air defense missiles.
Technologically superior to US long-range surface-to-air Patriot missiles, nothing in the West matches their effectiveness.
S-400s can destroy multiple hostile aircraft, ballistic missiles, and other aerial targets up to 250 miles away at high and low altitudes.
China was Russia’s first foreign buyer, its military saying it “saw that the S-400 system by its capabilities today is unparalleled in the world in its armament class.”
It’s able to overcome heavy enemy fire and electronic countermeasures. In 2017, Turkey contracted with Russia to buy S-400s.
Last month, President Erdogan affirmed the contract, saying deliveries of the air defense systems are formalized, adding purchase of Russian S-500s may follow when they’re available next year.
After meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov last Friday, Turkish Foreign Minister Melvet Cavusoglu said the following:
“The contract with Russia on S-400s remains in force and these defensive systems will be delivered to Turkey.”
“(T)alks on this issue are underway. We are not going to sell S-400s to third countries. We do not need this as we are acquiring them for our own needs.”
In 2017, Turkey made an advance payment for the systems to Moscow, deliveries expected in July.
Last year, US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Wess Mitchell warned Turkey, saying
“(w)e made it clear that if (Erdogan) buys S-400s, there will be consequences.”
“We will introduce sanctions within the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Delivering F-35 combat aircraft Ankara contracted for may be halted.”
On Monday, the US halted deliveries of F-35 parts and equipment to Turkey, an unnamed Trump regime official, saying:
“Pending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo the delivery of the S-400, deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey’s F-35 operational capability have been suspended while our dialogue on this important matter continues with Turkey.”
Last week, Dem Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Chris Van Hollen , along with Republicans James Lankford and Thom Tillis , introduced legislation to ban the sale of F-35 warplanes to Turkey unless it cancels purchases of Russian S-400s, Shaheen saying:
“The prospect of Russia having access to US aircraft and technology in a NATO country, Turkey, is a serious national and global security risk,” Lankford adding:
“Turkey is an important NATO ally and willing partner in addressing a number of US national security priorities. It’s concerning that Turkey would seek close defense cooperation with Russia, whose authoritarian ruler (sic) seeks to undermine NATO and US interests at every turn (sic).”
Parts of the F-35 aircraft’s fuselage, landing gear, and cockpit displays are made in Turkey. Its government showed interest in the Patriot system, not at the expense of abandoning purchase of Russian S-400s.
Russia’s most advanced 5th generation Su-57 aircraft matches or exceeds the capabilities of the Pentagon’s F-35 at a fraction of the cost per plane – about $40 to $45 compared to well over $100 million for the overpriced US aircraft.
Sukhoi United Aircraft Corporation’s head developer Mikhail Strelets said the US F-22 wasn’t designed to strike ground targets like the Su-57, calling the Russian aircraft more versatile to the F-22 and F-35.
According to Russia’s Rostec corporation, the Su-57 and other advanced Russian aircraft have innovative glass coatings, saying:
“It doubles radar wave absorption and reduces the aircraft cockpit’s radar signature by 30%. Currently, the coating is applied to the canopy of T-50 (Su-57 aircraft since August 2017), Su-30, Su-34, Su-35, MiG-29K and Tu-160 planes.”
The coating reduces visibility to hostile radar and protects pilots from ultraviolet, thermal and other potential harm.
The Su-57 is designed to destroy all types of long and short-range air, ground, and naval targets, overcoming air defense capabilities to successfully complete their missions.
Rostec’s Viktor Kladov said Putin may approve sales to foreign buyers of the Su-57E, a variant of the 5th generation Su-57. Turkey expressed interest in the aircraft if Washington halts deliveries of F-35s.

Rehabilitation center for marine mammals to be created in Russia’s Far East,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/rehabilitation-center-for-marine-mammals-to-be-created-in-russias-far-east.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
VLADIVOSTOK, April 5. /TASS/. Authorities of Russia’s Far Eastern Primorye Region are set to create a rehabilitation center for marine mammals this year on the region’s territory.
According to the plan, it will be located in Srednyaya Bay where 10 orcas and 87 beluga whales are kept now, the region’s Governor Oleg Kozhemyajko told reporters in Vladivostok.
Eleven orcas had been kept for sale to China in the facility in Srednyaya Bay along with 90 beluga whales. However, three beluga whales went missing, and one orca reportedly disappeared. Police are carrying out an investigation. A criminal case has been launched into illegal hunting of these mammals.
The governor said Srednyaya Bay would be a suitable place to create a rehabilitation center for cetaceans, but he did not name any exact timeframes then.
“We are moving towards creating there [Srednyaya Bay] a rehabilitation center because near our shores marine mammals get in trouble from time to time or they are thrown. That’s why we are facing the task of adapting and treating them, and to ensure that they are in normal conditions, and we are discussing this issue with scientists. <…>This year a rehabilitation center will be opened in Srednyaya Bay,” the governor said.
Water samples have been taken from both Srednyaya Bay and Paris Bay, but the first place is expected to be preferable.
The governor noted that the authorities together with scientists will start drawing up a roadmap soon. The creation of a rehabilitation center soon will help release cetaceans after treatment or send some of them to local dolphinariums.
On March 11, members of the council of scientists were approved who will be tasked with assessing the condition of these mammals and prepare recommendations for their rehabilitation. Among them will be representatives of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Far Eastern Federal University, the National Scientific Center for Marine Biology and other scientific organizations. The Russian Scientific-Research Institute of Fishery and Oceanography will coordinate its work.
On March 22, the Primorye Region’s administration and members of the Russian Scientific-Research Institute of Fishery and Oceanography as well as representatives of the companies, which hold the whales in captivity, signed an agreement on cooperation to decide on the fate of the mammals and their possible release back into the wild.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture together with scientific organizations to come up with a solution for the whales.

KIEV, April 5. /TASS/. Ukraine’s incumbent President Pyotr Poroshenko, seeking a second term in office, has given blood for drug and alcohol tests in a laboratory at Kiev’s Olympiysky Stadium on Friday.
Before the procedure, which was broadcast live on YouTube, the president signed documents confirming he was giving blood voluntarily and had no objections to the tests’ results being made public.
“Everything was very easy,” Poroshenko said afterwards.
While talking to reporters later, the Ukrainian president said he was satisfied with the fact that Vladimir Zelensky had accepted his invitation to a debate. “This is not a show, it is an opportunity to get information and answers to questions about the country’s future in years and decades to come,” Poroshenko said.
Zelensky, the second presidential candidate to enter a runoff, gave blood for testing at a private clinic in Kiev earlier on Friday. He told reporters the results would be made public in three days.
The Ukrainian presidential election was held on March 31. With 100% of the vote counted, leader of the Servant of the People political party Vladimir Zelensky is in the lead with 30.24% of the vote, followed by incumbent President Pyotr Poroshenko, who garnered 15.95%. Since none of the candidates managed to get more than 50% of the vote, the top two are headed towards the runoff scheduled to take place on April 21.

TRANSCRIPT:
Buongiorno, good morning to you all. It’s a pleasure to be among such a lovely group of far-right radicals. After all, according to much of the media, that IS in fact what we are. We’re a gathering of the world’s leading anti’s: we’re all anti-gay, anti-abortion, anti-feminist. Even a prominent politician in Italy called this Congress “a conference for right wing losers.”
I certainly understand why they’re so confident. Everywhere we look today, the champions of secular liberalism are celebrating another victory. Whether it’s so-called same-sex marriage, or the 50 different gender options on Facebook, or lawsuits against Christian business owners, every day we are reminded that our world is changing in ways hitherto unimaginable.
And yet, behind all the indignant insults and blustering banter, make no mistake, secular liberals are panicked. Over the last decade we’ve seen winds of change that are politically and culturally transforming the world, especially here in Europe, in ways secular liberals never imagined in their worst nightmares. And so, what I want to do for you this morning is introduce you to a field of scholarship that actually predicted these changing winds long before they occurred, which will in turn give us a window into what to expect for the future.
It was several years ago; I was doing research for my doctoral studies, and I came across this field of scholarship called ‘post-secular studies.’ And I have to admit, that term shocked me; post-secular? How can that be when it appears that everywhere we look, the world is becoming more secular not post-secular? But there they were, scholar after scholar arguing that we are in fact entering a post-secular age.
Now by post-secular, they mean very simply that our world is currently going through a massive religious renewal. Today, according to the World Values Survey, 4 out 5 people in the world, that’s 80 percent of the world’s population, ascribe allegiance to one of the major historic world religions. In sub-Sahara Africa, Christianity is actually growing faster than the continent’s population growth, suggesting massive conversion rates. In the Middle East, more Muslims are attending mosque than ever before in the history of Islam.
China is currently experiencing what may be the single greatest Christian revival ever recorded in the history of the church. Hungary’s government has declared its commitment to the revitalization of Christian civilization, all the while Poland has formally declared Jesus Christ as Lord and King over their nation. India is currently experiencing a massive Hindu nationalist revival led by the Baharatiya Janata Party which is the single largest democratic party on the planet. In the Russian Federation, the Orthodox Church has risen to a prominence not seen since the days of the Tsars. And in Latin America, Pentecostalism is sweeping throughout the region all the while more Catholics are attending Mass than ever before. It’s no wonder that a number of scholars believe that we are currently experiencing the single greatest religious surge the world has ever seen.
And yet, I couldn’t help but think something’s not right! How could religion be surging all the while it appeared that the world was becoming more secular? How do we put these two competing dynamics together?
In a word, these two dynamics come together in something that we now commonly refer to as globalization. We all basically know what globalization is, at least intuitively: Coke-a-cola, McDonalds, Amazon, the International Monetary Fund. Have you ever noticed that all airline pilots sound the same? We’re all living today with the same fast-food chains, the same internet search engines, the same computer processors. This is globalization: a one-size-fits-all political and economic system that basically turns the entire world into a giant version of Orlando, Florida.
But these post-secular scholars have long recognized an inherent futility in globalization; you see, globalization is rooted in a philosophical commitment known as modernity; and modernity, simply put, is the enthronement of scientific rationalism as the one true way of knowing the world; a one-size-fits-all form of knowledge for all peoples, times, and places. What post-secular scholars have noticed is that global populations simply don’t believe this anymore. Indeed, Western cultures in particular have become what we call post-modern, in that they’ve increasingly rejected modernity in favor of a plurality of cultural ways of knowing and being in the world.
However, and here’s the key, even though people have rejected modernity, that hasn’t stopped Western elites, our political, corporate, and media elites from continuing to export modernity in the form of globalization. In other words, our elites are trying to export the fruit of modernity even though its roots have rotted out. But if populations have rejected a one-size-fits-all philosophical system, then inevitably they’re going to reject a one-size-fits-all political and economic system. And so, what we’re seeing today is a massive backlash going on all over the world against globalization, where populations are once again reasserting their nation’s cultures, customs, and traditions, particularly their religious traditions as mechanisms of resistance against the anti-cultural processes of globalization and its secular aristocracy. And this resurgence of religion is as global as globalization itself!
So there are our two competing dynamics. But this of course raises the question: Is this it? Are we just going to see a perpetual clash between secular globalism and traditionalist nationalism for the indefinite future?
The answer to that question is a resounding: ‘No!’ And that’s because, at the heart of this post-secular religious resurgence is nothing less than the revitalization of the natural family. Scholars such as Eric Kaufmann of the University of London are recognizing that we are in fact in the early stages of a demographic revolution, a revolution where conservative religionists are on course, and these are his words, “to take over the world.” What scholars are noticing is that there is a dramatic demographic difference between secularists and conservative religionists. For example, in the U.S., conservative evangelical women have a 30 percent fertility advantage over their secular counterparts, and this demographic deficit has dramatic effects over time. In a population evenly divided between conservatives and secularists, a 30 percent fertility differential means that in one generation, that 50/50 split will turn into a 60/40 split; in two generations, that would widen into a 75/25 split, and in the course of 200 years, it would be a 99 to 1 split.
Already, demographers are estimating that there will be over 300 million Mormons in the United States by the end of the century, and by the end of next century there will be over 300 million Amish! (Do you know the Amish? Beards and wooden fire places!) So America will be basically evangelicals, Mormons, and Amish! (I know there’s a joke in there somewhere, but I haven’t figured it out.)
But it’s not just the United States; conservative religionists are flourishing everywhere. In France, 30 percent of women are having over 50 percent of all births. Hungary, Poland, and Russia have implemented pro-family policies that are effectively reversing their respective fertility declines. And the Orthodox Church in Georgia has helped their nation go from one of the lowest fertility rates in Eastern Europe to one of the highest.
By contrast, secularists consistently exemplify a low fertility rate of around 1.5 children per couple which is significantly below the replacement level of 2.1. As a consequence, starting around the year 2030, Kaufmann and others are estimating that the secular population will begin a steady decline to little more than about 10 to 15 percent of national populations. This is what’s being called secularism’s ‘demographic contradiction’; their own devotion to radical individualism has become the agent by which their entire ideology implodes.
But more than that: if the renewal of the family is at the heart of this religious resurgence, then that means that this congress, this World Congress of Families, stands at the very epicenter of that renewal. We are not a conference of right-wing losers, we are not a bunch of medieval hangovers; we are the future, a PRO-life, PRO-child, PRO-family future, and there’s nothing they can do to stop us. Welcome to our new post-secular age.

EU Drafts New Copyright Directive to Protect Existing Media Giants,www.therussophile.org,Tom Luongo,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/eu-drafts-new-copyright-directive-to-protect-existing-media-giants.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Tom is a regular contributor not only here at Russia Insider but also at Seeking Alpha and Newsmax . Check out his blog, Gold Goats ‘n Guns and please support his work through his Patreon where he also publishes his monthly investment newsletter.
The EU’s new, comprehensive new Copyright Directive passed the European Parliament ensuring the way we use the Internet will change in the future.
And not for the better.
The controversial parts are Articles 11 and 13, the “link tax” and the “upload filter” requirements. For a good run down of how terrible these new rules are look anywhere on the internet but this article at Gizmodo (who I hope doesn’t charge me a link tax for doing so!) will do.
I would also watch this video from Dave Cullen, a resident of Ireland, i.e. the EU, as to what he thinks this means.
[embedded content]
Dave makes a number of fantastic points about the ramifications of Articles 11 and 13 which I will not dispute.
The arrogance and pig-headedness of EU MEPs to push this through without even listening to arguments for Amendments speaks volumes as to how much this legislation was bought and paid for.
And you know who was doing the buying. The same folks currently behind destroying Brexit — The Davos Crowd . I don’t want to put too fine a point on this now, since I’ve covered all this recently ( here ) and in the past ( here ). Controlling The Wire
But there are very valid reasons why this push for control of information flow from the EU is yet another example of their desperation to keep control of what I’ve in the past called The Wire:
In short, The Wire is the main conduit through which we communicate with each other. Even money is The Wire. What are prices if not information about what we are willing to part with our money in exchange for?Without The Wire modern society fails. So, government can’t shut it down but neither can it allow unrestrained access to it.Electricity, commerce, communications, everything, goes over The Wire. This isn’t a radical concept but like all important ideas, once it is presented to you you can’t unsee it.
Control of The Wire is the only fight that matters or has ever mattered in society. The Internet is The Wire writ large. Therefore, it only makes sense that control of it is paramount to maintaining any control over society at large.
The corporate oligarchs are in fear for their projects. They want desperately to maintain control. They’ve worked for decades to evolve the nation-state into the new shiny transnational superstate the EU exemplifies.
The new Copyright Directive is designed to erect barriers-to-entry and shut down opposition speech by outsourcing the enforcement to the platforms hosting the material.
And those platforms are only too happy to do this because they get to crowd out any potential competition. So, while their costs increase slightly, they are now immune to the competition which would grind out their margins to zero over time, as any unfettered market would.
Remember, that in all human endeavors profit is an ever-elusive thing. With incentives properly aligned someone is always attracted to the profit someone else is achieving and will figure out a way to build a better mousetrap, as it were, grinding out that profit.
If you can short-circuit this process via control of The Wire then you can guarantee a profit for your past work for far longer than you would otherwise.
This is known as rent. Fake Property, False Choices
This is why the music and film industry want their IP protected from ‘fair use’ policies. They see the plummeting margins and want to continue charging on a per use/listen/view basis things they retain the copyright to far beyond the public’s willingness to pay them.
It’s too expensive for these companies to go after us individually. That doesn’t work except in very limited ways. Yes, they can de-platform Alex Jones or Sargon of Akkad ad hoc but with predictable backlash against it.
Enshrining it in law takes this, however, to another level. And it is a yet another Hobson’s Choice put before people to either accept regulation of these companies as public utilities — ensuring their monopoly status — or render the internet unusable.
This Directive is pure protectionism of legacy media producers be it news, music, film, etc. whose business models haven’t just collapsed they’re literally now subsidized by other profitable industries, i.e. the Washington Post is, effectively, an Amazon company.
So, in effect, Article 11 and 13 are just typical corporatist honey pots, at least in theory.
But it is all bad? Is the future to be this and more laws and controls like this?
Likely not. IP Deflation
Let’s look specifically at the link tax . To do this we have to look at a worst-case scenario where the EU disregards all cross-border treaty and tax-enforcement issues and our governments go along with this nonsense.
So, I want to link to an article in Der Speigel to make some point about Angela Merkel.
To do so now, under Article 13, I have to get a license to link from them and pay a fee. Let’s call that fee €100. Instead of paying that fee my natural reaction would be to not link to it and just make reference to it.
I’ll quote it and not put in a link.
If that doesn’t work and WordPress takes my post down, I’ll screencap the relevant section of the article (4chan-style) and then not link to it. This requires a more sophisticated sniffer to figure out what I did.
And in the worst case if they figure that out, I’ll simply not even quote them anymore. And I’ll write the article in such a way that I don’t need to. They don’t get the traffic anymore. They never got the license fee.
The result is they fall in the Google search rankings.
And I get to keep my traffic up and my audience happy.
Who wins here? Me or them?
Me.
Especially if I keep my link license fee set for my content at what it’s worth, zero.
To me a link is free advertising. I know that each one is a gift that pays huge dividends. I cherish people who contact me for permission to scrape my work.
The whole point of what I do is to reach as wide an audience as possible. Why would I put up barriers to that?
You have to put this in perspective. Ninety five percent of the news you read is a restatement of a government or corporate press release. If you think someone can’t reprint government or corporate press releases for less than €100 a head you are crazy.
Just like it is in retail sales. Amazon is killing local retailers because easily cross-shopped items are simply more efficiently delivered without a brick and mortar storefront. The costs of maintaining it and people going to the central location is a waste of scarce, precious capital.
It’s an old model without a future.
News organizations that don’t add anything but only disseminate the same stuff but with a slightly different spin on it won’t be able to charge a dime for links. Functionally, for 95% of news, is there any difference between Yahoo!, MSN, CNN or FOX?
No.
If you produce something that is value-added people will figure out a way to justify to themselves paying for it. Advertising covers some of that cost. If they don’t it isn’t lost revenue, it was revenue you never had in the first place at that price.
In the Internet business eyeballs are everything. Losing eyeballs for link taxes is just bad business. The Last War
So the EU just gave these sclerotic, dying industries everything they’ve ever wanted. But, in the long run, it will be their undoing as it will incentivize an entire generation of citizen journalists to fill in the niches and do primary research.
Moreover, it will be unenforceable at any practical level, as Dave Cullen points out. The EU will itself cause a cratering of traffic to and from its IP ranges.
As the cost of The Wire drops on a per megabyte basis, think 5G, so too does the cost to resist control of it. Lower bandwidth costs makes possible peer-to-peer networking and decentralized autonomous organizations that even the most hardened crypto-enthusiast haven’t conceived of yet.
And once there are no middle men to go after and turn into the copyright police, we’re back to them going after individuals again. At that point it’s game over.
That’s a long way off at this point and the present will be difficult, at best, to navigate. But we’re not flat-footed here. I do feel for guys like Dave Cullen who build great content and now are looking at real constraints.
I don’t envy them in the slightest.
But to me this feels like just another desperation move by old men fighting the last war to hold onto The Wire that’s slipping out of their fingers, writing laws out of date before they are even implemented.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called on NATO members to get united in the face of what he called “emerging threats” from great powers like, Iran, Russia and China.
Addressing NATO foreign ministers who gathered to mark the 70th anniversary of the military alliance in Washington, Pompeo said, “We have rightly sought peace through strength here in NATO.”
“We must continue to do so, especially in this new era of great power competition from Russia, from China, and the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Pompeo added.
He called for US-led military alliance to address “emerging threats” including the rise of China as well as Iran.
The United States has enjoyed less support over the issue, with all of its NATO allies backing the landmark Iran nuclear deal from which President Donald Trump withdrew last year.
Pompeo has also been seeking with limited success to persuade US allies not to choose Chinese telecom giant Huawei for their fifth-generation networks, claiming that the company poses risks to security and personal privacy.
He further called on the member countries to enhance defense capabilities and security spending to confront terrorism, uncontrolled migration and new technologies.
The gathering that was intended to celebrate the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , however, was overshadowed by a deepening dispute with Turkey — a NATO member — over its planned purchase of advanced Russian-built S-400 air defense missile systems, as well as Washington’s demands for allies to boost their defense spending.

Pompeo reiterated calls for the member states to increase their defense budget, saying they need to convince their citizens “of the importance, the relevance, the intrinsic centrality of this institution” is “a key step in confronting these threats head on.”
Though Pompeo did not address the spat with Ankara in his speech, he reiterated Washington’s stance on the issue in a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu a day earlier.
He expressed Washington’s displeasure with Ankara over an agreement it finalized with Moscow in December 2017 on the delivery of the S-400 missile systems.
Pompeo warned Ankara with US sanctions over the purchase from Russia.
Turkey-Russia S-400 ‘done deal’
Cavusoglu, however, made it clear that the purchase of the missile system from Russia “is a done deal” and that Ankara does not have to choose between Russia and other countries.
“We are not choosing between Russia and any other allies… We don’t see our relations with Russia as an alternative to our relations with others. And nobody, neither West nor Russia, should or can ask us to choose,” he said at a panel organized by the Atlantic Council titled “Turkey’s Role in NATO and Regional Security Challenges” in Washington DC.
He also explained that Ankara has proposed to Washington “to establish a technical working group to make sure that this system will not be a threat – neither to US F-35s nor the NATO systems.”
“The S-400 is a finished, done deal. The F-35 is a comprehensive program. As Turkey, we manufacture many parts of the F-35s. Turkey is a part of it,” he added.
The US has already suspended deliveries of equipment of F-35 jets to Ankara.
He also said that Washington has made a final offer for Patriot defense system sales to Turkey, adding that there is no guarantee on a deal with Washington.
“We couldn’t get it for 10 years,” Cavusoglu said. “That’s why we had to buy from Russia.”
Bolton busy campaigning against China at UN
In the meantime, US National Security Advisor John Bolton was busy campaigning against what he called China’s influence in the United Nations and other international organizations, wrote American news publication, Foreign Policy.
The Trump administration was concerned about “China’s actions, which highlight self-serving behavior and its inability to play a leadership role in multilateral institutions,” said National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis.
The two sides are locked in a deepening trade dispute , since last year.
The two world powers are also engaged in confrontations in the South China Sea, which is mostly claimed by Beijing.
The sea, which is a gateway for trillions of dollars in maritime trade each year, is also claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and Brunei.
The US – which sides with China’s rivals in their territorial claims — sends its bomber over the sea in a show of force.
Besides its aerial missions, Washington also sends warships close to the islands claimed by China in what the US calls “freedom of navigation” patrols.
China, however, sees such flights and naval patrols as both clear provocation and a show of force challenging its sovereignty. It says such deployments could easily trigger miscalculation or even accidents at sea or in air.

China has armed its Type 072-ii Yuting-class tank landing ship Haiyang Shan with an electromagnetic railgun. The warship is in service with the East Sea Fleet of the People’s Liberation Army Navy.

In January 2019, reports appeared that the Chinese military had successfully finished tests of “the world’s most powerful naval gun.” According to this very version, the weapon is set to be battlefield ready by 2025.
“Between 2015 and 2017, the weapon was calibrated to strike at extended ranges, increasing its lethality. By December 2017, the weapon was successfully mounted on a warship and began at-sea testing, a feat no other nation has accomplished. The Chinese are expected to complete at-sea testing by 2023,” CNBC claimed.
There have been no official reports on the capabilities of the weapon. However, it’s expected that the gun is capable of striking a target 124 miles away at speeds of up to 1.6 miles per second. Click to see the full-size image MORE ON THE TOPIC:"

( CD ) — Campaigners have organized rallies nationwide for Thursday in order to give voice to the widespread public demand the report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice by Special Counsel Robert Mueller be disclosed to members of Congress and the public—with as little redaction as possible—without further delay.
Spearheaded by a coalition of progressive groups— including MoveOn, Public Citizen, People For the American Way, and Indivisible— more than 300 rapid-response events across the country have been scheduled to make it clear that people want the report made available to lawmakers in the public. Most protests will start at 5 pm local time. Find one near you here . Congress set last night as the deadline for Barr to release the unredacted Mueller report, and he failed to deliver.
In response, Americans in 300+ towns across the country are mobilizing TOMORROW at 5pm to demand the DOJ #ReleaseTheReport .
— Public Citizen (@Public_Citizen) April 3, 2019
In addition to the dispersed rallies nationwide, people in Washington, D.C. will demonstrate outside the White House on Thursday afternoon to demand Attorney General William Barr releases the full report to the U.S. House Judiciary Committee and as much information as possible to the public.
“Majorities of Americans believe the full Mueller report should be made public,” declared Public Citizen in a statement, referencing polls showing “overwhelming” support for the report’s disclosure. “Protesters will demand full transparency so that Congress can conduct responsible oversight of the executive branch.” Exactly. It’s time to #ReleaseTheReport . We’re hitting the streets TODAY at 5PM local time to demand the #MuellerReport be released immediately!

Angel Padilla, Indivisible’s national policy director, argued that both Barr and the Trump administration “have drawn unverifiable conclusions from a report no one else has been allowed to see while ignoring the overwhelming majority of Americans who want it to be made public.”
On Thursday evening, Padilla added, “the people will make it clear that they want the report and they want it now. We hope Barr listens.” TODAY is the National Day of Action calling for the immediate release of the Mueller report!
300+ events will take place across the country at 5pm local time!

While the DOJ on Thursday said it needs more time to fully redact the Mueller report, Marge Baker, People for the American Way’s vice president, explained last week that what has so far been made public—namely Barr’s four-page summary of the report’s findings—will not suffice.
“A summarizing statement from an attorney general demonstrably hostile to the special counsel investigation—written without consulting Mueller—is not sufficient in any way, especially when the administration’s public messaging about the report exonerating Trump seems to directly contradict the text of Barr’s letter,” said Baker. “The only way to get the truth is for Congress and the public to see the report and its underlying findings.”

Former US Intelligence Agents Urge Trump to Avoid War in Venezuela,www.therussophile.org,Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/former-us-intelligence-agents-urge-trump-to-avoid-war-in-venezuela.html/,"This post was originally published on this site VIPS warn that Trump’s policies regarding Venezuela appear to be on a slippery slope that could take us toward war in Venezuela and military confrontation with Russia. MEMORANDUM FOR: The President
FROM: Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS)
SUBJECT: Avoiding War with Russia over Venezuela
Mr. President:
Your Administration’s policies regarding Venezuela appear to be on a slippery slope that could take us toward war in Venezuela and military confrontation with Russia. As former intelligence officers and other national security practitioners with many decades of experience, we urge you not to let yourself be egged on into taking potentially catastrophic military action in response to civil unrest in Venezuela or Russian activities in the Western Hemisphere. With the recent arrival of two transport aircraft and enduring political support for the government of Venezuela, the Russians are far from crossing any “red line” emanating from the 1823 Monroe Doctrine. Unfulfilled Objectives in Venezuela
Inside Venezuela, U.S. actions have failed to do more than plunge the country into deeper crisis, cause greater human suffering, and increase the prospects of violence on a national scale. President Maduro’s mishandling of the economy and authoritarian reactions to provocations are impossible to defend, but they result in part from the fact that he has been under siege since he was first elected in 2013 and has faced sanctions aimed ultimately at removing him from office. In our view, the advice you’ve received from your top advisors – Florida Senator Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor John Bolton, Special Representative Elliott Abrams, and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo – was and apparently continues to be wrong. Recognition of Venezuelan National Assembly President Juan Guaidó as “interim president” did not prompt the military to rise up against President Maduro. Neither did attacking the officer corps as merely corrupt opportunists and drug-traffickers enriched through loyalty to former President Chávez and Maduro, nor did repeatedly threatening them with harsher sanctions. Those actions reflected a fundamental misunderstanding about the Venezuelan military, which has never been free of corruption and political compromise but has also never been so totally isolated from the Venezuelan people that it hasn’t felt their suffering. U.S. policies incorrectly assumed that the officers – while probably fed up with Maduro’s shortcomings – would support Guaidó despite his faction’s commitment to dismantle Chavismo , which most officers believe brought historically necessary changes to the country, including enfranchisement of the poor.
Similarly, your Administration’s repeated hints at military intervention have been counterproductive to your regime-change objectives. Your policy and intelligence advisors were correct in interpreting the disparate polling data showing popular support for Guaidó as actually being support for the U.S. to extricate the country from its crisis – the National Assembly President was a political unknown until the United States and others recognized his claim to the Presidency – but your team showed a lack of understanding of Venezuelan nationalism. Venezuelans do not welcome the destruction that would be caused by U.S. military attack; they recall the death toll of Operation Just Cause, when the United States killed more than 3,000 Panamanians (by its own count) to remove one corrupt authoritarian, Manuel Noriega. Threats of invasion have pushed people to circle around Maduro, however reluctantly, not reject him. Your Administration’s strategy of punishing the Venezuelan people, including apparently knocking out their electricity, seems based on the false assumption that humanitarian crisis will prompt a coup to remove Maduro. In fact, the U.S. sanctions have allowed Maduro to shift blame from his own failings to U.S. malice – and it has left Guaidó, whom your advisors portray as the moral equivalent of our Founders, looking like a sell-out to Yankee imperialists at the cost of the Venezuelan people’s health and welfare and magnified civil disorder. Lost Opportunity for Diplomacy
Senator Rubio, Mr. Bolton, Mr. Abrams, and Mr. Pompeo have also squandered a formidable moment to build on common values with allies in Latin America and Europe. Even though most Latin Americans find your aides’ public assertion that the Monroe Doctrine is alive and well to be insulting, the right-leaning Presidents of most of South and Central America rallied with you to support Guaidó’s self-proclamation. But Guaidó’s lack of leadership – he appears totally scripted by U.S. Government agencies – his inflexibility on negotiations, his open call for U.S. military intervention, and your own Administration’s dangling threat of war are rapidly alienating all but the most subservient to U.S. policy dictates. Negotiation proposals, such as those being developed by the International Contact Group, are gaining momentum. Internationalizing the Conflict
National Security Advisor Bolton and others have sought to internationalize the Venezuela issue since before Guaidó’s proclamation. Bolton’s reference to a “Troika of Tyranny” in November – which he called “a triangle of terror stretching from Havana to Caracas to Managua” and “sordid cradle of communism in the Western Hemisphere” – was a veiled Cold War-era swipe at Russia and China. Mr. Bolton, Senator Rubio, and other advisors have made clear on numerous occasions that the overthrow of President Maduro would be just the first stage in efforts to eliminate the current governments of the “Troika” and “Communist influence” in the Western Hemisphere. They have repeatedly asserted that Cuban advisors have been crucial to the Maduro government’s survival without providing evidence. Indeed, the reportedly “hundreds” of Venezuelan military defectors, including many managed by U.S. agencies, have not provided even credible hearsay evidence that Cubans are doing more than providing routine assistance. In addition, the threats coming out of Washington have preempted any willingness that Cuba might have had to contribute to a regional solution to the Venezuelan crisis as it has in similar situations, such as Colombia’s recent peace process, the Angola peace process in 1989-90, and the Central American negotiations in the early 1990s. Provocative Rhetoric about Russia
Most dangerous, however, are aggressive statements about Russia’s engagement with Venezuela. Russian oil companies, particular Rosneft, have long been in Venezuela – bailing out the Venezuelan petroleum company (PDVSA) as its mismanagement and falling oil prices have caused production and revenues to plummet. Most long-term observers believe Rosneft’s decisions, including throwing good money after bad, have been motivated by business calculations, without a particularly ideological objective. Your advisors’ rhetoric imposing an East-West spin on the issue presented President Putin and his advisors an opportunity to try to poke the United States in the eye – especially as Administration efforts to remove Maduro foundered and diplomatic support for Guaidó cracked. Maduro and Putin have not enjoyed particularly close personal relations in the past, and their shared strategic interests are few, but U.S. rhetoric and threats have given them common cause in tweaking us. A meeting in Rome between your special envoy, Elliot Abrams, and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov achieved nothing amid further U.S. sanctions against Venezuela and continued threats that “all options” were on the table.
Publicly available information is insufficient for us to know exactly what was aboard the two Russian aircraft that landed at Maiquetía last week – two months after your Administration publicly proclaimed its intention to remove Maduro – but precedent suggests Moscow had two main objectives. One, and probably primary, is to embarrass your Administration by defying your rhetoric, just to rub your nose in Moscow’s sovereign right to have the relations, including military liaison, with whomever it pleases. In this sense, Russian behavior resembles its intervention, at Bashar al-Assad’s request, in Syria. And it is not a far cry from Moscow’s reaction to the Western-supported coup in Kiev. Another objective, if press speculation about the Russian advisors and equipment aboard the aircraft is correct, would be to shore up Venezuela’s ability to warn of and respond to a U.S. military strike. Your Administration has publicly asserted that the Russians are helping repair S-300 surface-to-air missile systems, which have a purely defensive purpose. There is no evidence, not even circumstantial, that Russia has any offensive objectives in this relationship.
The U.S. reaction has suggested a much greater chance of military confrontation. Mr. Bolton “strongly caution[ed] actors external to the Western Hemisphere against deploying military assets to Venezuela, or elsewhere in the Hemisphere, with the intent of establishing or expanding military operations.” Without defining what activities he would object to, Mr. Bolton said, “We will consider such provocative actions as a direct threat to international peace and security in the region.” Your Special Representative said the “Russian presence” is “extremely pernicious.” Your Secretary of State said, “Russia’s got to leave Venezuela.” You said, “Russia has to get out” and reiterated that “all options are open” – including presumably forcing the Russians out militarily. And we note that Russia has not closed its embassy in Caracas as your Administration has. Avoiding the Slippery Slope
As intelligence officers and security experts, we have given many years to protecting our nation from a host of threats, including from the Soviet Union. We also believe, however, that picking fights. including ousting governments, blocking negotiated settlements, and threatening other countries’ sovereign decision to pursue activities that do not threaten our national security – is rarely the wise way to go.
We repeat that we are not defending Maduro and his record, while at the same time pointing out that many of his troubles have been exacerbated by U.S. policies and efforts to oust him. We believe that due process and practical, realistic policies better protect our national interests than threats and confrontational rhetoric. It strains credulity to believe that your advisors picked this fight with President Maduro without realizing that Venezuela would seek help fixing its defensive capabilities.
Moreover and very seriously, rhetoric challenging Russia could all too easily lead to a much more consequential confrontation. Invoking the 1823 Monroe Doctrine is unhelpful. For Russia to provide assistance for purely defensive purposes to a country in which we seek to create regime change and threaten military attack would not be widely seen as violating the Monroe Doctrine or crossing a “red line.” We realize that some in the media are trying to egg you on into taking forceful action, perhaps even of a military nature, to punish Russia in any case. We urge you not to fall into this trap. This is not 19th century Latin America, and it is a far cry from the Cuba missile crisis of 1962. The best way to prevent dangerous miscalculation would be for you to speak directly with President Putin. Washington’s energies would be better spent clearing up differences, adjusting failed policies, and promoting a peaceful resolution in Venezuela.

Nine Reasons Why You Should Support Joe Biden for President,www.therussophile.org,Caitlin Johnstone,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/nine-reasons-why-you-should-support-joe-biden-for-president-2.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
( CJ Opinion) — Former Vice President Joe Biden has released a video statement telling the American people that the accusations he is now facing of touching women in inappropriate ways without their consent is the product of changing “social norms”, assuring everyone that he will indeed be adjusting to those changes. And thank goodness. For a minute there, I was worried Biden might cave under the pressure of a looming scandal and decline to run for president on the grounds that it could cripple his campaign and leave America facing another four years of Donald Trump. Here are nine good reasons why I hope Joe Biden runs for president, and why you should support him too: 1. It’s his turn. It’s Biden’s turn to be president. He’s spent years playing second fiddle while other leading Democrats hogged all the limelight, and that’s not fair. He’s been waiting very patiently. Come on. 2. Most Qualified Candidate Ever. If Joe Biden secures the Democratic Party nomination for president, he would be the Most Qualified Candidate Ever to run for office. His service as a US Senator and a Vice President has given him unparalleled experience priming him for the most powerful elected office in the world. Everything Biden has done throughout his entire career proves that he’d make a great Commander-in-Chief. 3. He’s closely associated with a popular Democratic president. You think Biden, you think Obama. You think Obama, you think greatness. You can’t spend that much time with a great Democratic president without absorbing his greatness yourself. It’s called osmosis. 4. You liked Obama, didn’t you? Biden was part of the Obama administration. Remember the Obama administration? It was magical, right? If you want more of that, vote Biden. 5. But Trump! Do you want Trump to win the next election? You know he’ll shatter all our norms and literally end the world if he does, right? You should be terrified of the possibility of Trump winning in 2020, and if you are, you should want him running against Joe Biden. What’s the alternative? Nominating some crazy unelectable socialist like Bernie Sanders? Might as well just hand Trump the victory now, then. Anyone who wants to beat Trump must fall in line behind the Most Qualified Candidate Ever. 6. Iraq wasn’t so bad. Okay, maybe some of his past foreign policy positions look bad in hindsight, but come on. Pushing for the Iraq war was what everyone was doing back in those days. It was all the rage. We all made it through, right? I mean, most of us? 7. This is happening whether you like it or not. We’re doing this. We’re going to push Joe Biden through whether you like it or not, and we can do it the easy way or the hard way. Just relax, take deep breaths, and think about a nice place far away from here. Don’t struggle. This will be over before you know it. We’ll use plenty of lube. 8. Just vote for him. Just vote for him, you insolent little shits. Who the fuck do you think you are, anyway? You think you’re entitled to a bunch of ponies and unicorns like healthcare and drinkable water? You only think that because you’re a bunch of racist, sexist homophobes. You will vote for who we tell you to or we’ll spend the next four years calling you all Russian agents and screaming about Susan Sarandon. 9. Nothing could possibly go wrong. Honestly, what could possibly go wrong? It’s not like the Most Qualified Candidate Ever could manage to lose an election to some oafish reality TV star. Hell, Biden could beat Trump in his sleep. He could even skip campaigning in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and still win by a landslide, because those states are in the bag. There’s no way he could fail, barring some unprecedented and completely unforeseeable freak occurrences from way out of left field that nobody could possibly have anticipated.

Forget Russiagate: Here Are 5 Real Reasons Trump Needs to Go,www.therussophile.org,Derrick Broze,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/forget-russiagate-here-are-5-real-reasons-trump-needs-to-go.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
( TMU ) — Since at least May 2017, Americans have been subjected to non-stop, 24-7 coverage of the investigation into whether Donald Trump and Russian intelligence colluded to steal the 2016 election. Now that the investigation has concluded and the evidence was found lacking, it’s time to reflect on the entire process.
First, the corporate media hacks have now been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt to be severely lacking when it comes to journalistic integrity and dedication to truth. With their hyper-focus on Trump’s alleged connections to Russia, the corporate media has effectively fallen down on the job and failed to inform Americans about the stories that actually matter and affect them. Worst of all, the corporate media is ignoring legitimate criticisms of the Trump administration while focusing, sometimes exclusively, on conspiracy theories.
However, every problem presents an opportunity to provide a solution. The responsibility now falls on the independent media to continue spreading the truth while informing the masses. With that in mind, we present you with 5 Reasons Trump Needs to Go That Have Nothing to Do With Russia: 1. Endless War
No matter how you slice it, Trump’s administration has vastly increased military engagements around the world. Whether by providing weapons to Saudi Arabia which infamously lead to the deaths of Yemeni children on a school bus , or the killing of civilians in Somalia , it’s clear that Trump lied when he claimed he would not embroil the U.S. military in any more undeclared wars. There is also the ongoing U.S. military presence in Syria, the banging of war drums in Venezuela , and increasing conflict between the U.S., Russia, and China , which may end up engulfing the world in war.
However, when it comes to war, the corporate media not only fails to inform the public or call Trump’s action into question, they actually embrace his neo-conservative advisers and their calls for indiscriminate bombing campaigns . Even more despicable is the fact that the Trump administration has now stated they will repeal or deny visas to the staff of the International Criminal Court who might be seeking to investigate whether American soldiers were responsible for war crimes in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the move was an attempt to “ protect the American and allied military and civilian personnel from living in fear of unjust prosecution for actions taken to defend our great nation ,” but it seems quite obvious that Pompeo and Trump simply do not want America’s crimes to come to light. 2. Trump is the New Drone King
After Trump came into office, it became clear that he wanted to erase Obama’s legacy as “The Drone King.” However, Trump didn’t want to simply replace Obama as the new drone king, he wanted to expand drone bombings. In March 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump was handing the authority to conduct drone strikes in foreign countries against alleged terrorists back to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The decision by Trump reversed a policy held under the Obama administration, which called for National Security Officials or the president himself to authorize drone strikes.
“ To me, it looks like taking the gloves off the CIA to be able to go after these militants, or suspected militants ,” Karl Kaltenthaler, a professor at the University of Akron and an expert in the intersection of drones and modern warfare, told US News. “ The Trump administration is basically unraveling all of the 2013 presidential policy guidance. These are now covert operations, the government can’t say anything about these in the public sphere, they can’t even confirm or deny that these operations even took place .”
Just weeks ago Trump rescinded a rule requiring U.S. intelligence officials to publicly disclose the number of civilians killed by drone strikes. Trump used an executive order to scrap the three-year-old rule, which instructed the Director of National Intelligence to produce an annual report on all civilians killed by U.S. drone strikes outside of official war zones. This move might be in relation to recent reports which indicate that Trump has increased the amount of drones, resulting in an increase in civilian deaths. 3. Embracing the Surveillance State, 5g, and Facial Recognition Tech
Since Donald Trump became President of the United States, he has made it clear that he embraces the Surveillance State that was erected by his predecessors George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Trump’s original proposition for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border included provisions for biometrics, automatic license plate readers, cameras, and many more digital surveillance tools. Although he has yet to achieve his goal of building that wall, the bills that have been proposed make it clear that his administration envisions a heavily fortified structure with all the latest tools for monitoring the docile public.
The Trump administration has also worked with the Transportation Security Administration to embrace the use of facial recognition cameras in airports, going so far as requiring facial recognition scanning for all passengers by 2021 .
Donald Trump has also sided with the Big Wireless Lobby in their pursuit of 5th Generation—or 5G—cellular technology that has been opposed by scientists , politicians , and activists. It should be clear to anyone paying attention that Donald Trump is a big fan of Big Brother. 4. Supporting the Persecution and Prosecution of Julian Assange & Chelsea Manning
During his campaign for President, Donald Trump famously said he loved Wikileaks, but after he was elected he began singing a different tune. Trump is now calling for the prosecution of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and the U.S. government has been increasingly putting pressure on the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to turn him over to the United States.
The Trump administration has also recently come under fire for the treatment of U.S. Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning. Manning was recently summoned to answer questions as part of a grand jury subpoena. For refusing to participate in the secret grand jury process, she was arrested and has been held in solitary confinement since. It is believed that the questions relate to Manning’s 2010 leaks of U.S. Army documents to Wikileaks. On April 3, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez expressed support for Manning, tweeting, “ Chelsea is being tortured for whistleblowing, she should be released on bail, and we should ban extended solitary in the US. ” 5. Trump is Fighting to SAVE the Deep State
Trump previously supported the extension of the controversial section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). According the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Section 702 “ allows the NSA to collect emails, browser history and chat logs of Americans. Section 702 also allows other agencies, like the FBI, to search through that data without a warrant. Those searches are called ‘backdoor searche s’.”
As revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013, Section 702 also authorizes two internet surveillance programs known as PRISM and Upstream. PRISM gathers messaging data sent via Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and other tech companies, while Upstream taps into the so-called backbone of the internet to gather data on targets. Instead of any meaningful reform, the Senate version of the bill to reform Section 702 asks the FBI to submit a request to the the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court if they end up in possession of an American’s data. This is the very definition of the wolf guarding the hen house because the FISA court is notoriously secretive with little oversight. Critics say a lack of transparency has allowed various federal agencies to run mass surveillance programs with no accountability.
The FISA Court is a glaring example of The Deep State. A secret court run by secret judges who interpret the law behind closed doors, refusing to publicly release their findings or their interpretations. Section 702 is only one of many tools at the hands of The Deep State and the Trump administration is doing its best to allow the program to continue.

( TM ) – The US must choose between remaining Turkey’s ally or siding with terrorists, Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Wednesday in response to US Vice President Mike Pence’s tweet urging Ankara to choose between the US and Russia, the Hürriyet Daily News reported.
“The United States must choose. Does it want to remain Turkey’s ally or risk our friendship by joining forces with terrorists to undermine its NATO ally’s defense against its enemies?” Oktay tweeted.
Ankara has been critical of US support for Syrian Kurdish militias in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Turkish authorities believe the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) are an offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) terrorist group, which has been waging an insurgency against the Turkish army for decades.
His remarks came in response to his US counterpart Mike Pence’s tweet in which he said that Turkey must choose whether it wants to remain a critical partner of NATO or continue its purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system.
“Turkey must choose. Does it want to remain a critical partner in the most successful military alliance in history or does it want to risk the security of that partnership by making such reckless decisions that undermine our @NATO alliance?” Pence said.

WikiLeaks Says Assange Will Be Arrested in “Hours to Days”,www.therussophile.org,Consortium News,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/wikileaks-says-assange-will-be-arrested-in-hours-to-days.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
( CN ) — WikiLeaks warned Thursday that its founder “will be expelled within ‘hours to days’” from Ecuador’s London embassy and that Ecuador has an agreement with Britain to have him arrested.
President Lenin Moreno will use the pretext of a scandal engulfing his presidency to oust Assange, a “high level source” in the Ecuador government told WikiLeaks. BREAKING: A high level source within the Ecuadorian state has told @WikiLeaks that Julian Assange will be expelled within “hours to days” using the #INAPapers offshore scandal as a pretext–and that it already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest. https://t.co/adnJph79wq
— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 4, 2019
Moreno has accused WikiLeaks of leaking documents allegedly implicating him and his family in a corruption scheme with a Panamanian investment firm, INA Investments Corp. WikiLeaks has denied being behind the leaks and no documents related to the scandal appear on its website.
Moreno said the alleged leak by WikiLeaks is a breach in a “protocol” with Assange that allows him to remain in the London embassy in exchange for his public silence on all political matters. Assange has never agreed to the protocol. His social media accounts were shut down by Ecuador in March 2018.
Because of this so-called “breach,” Assange will be made to leave the embassy and would be arrested by British authorities. Assange has been a refugee inside the embassy since 2012, fearing that if he were to be arrested the UK would extradite him to the United States to stand trail for publishing classified information.
Last week Assange engaged in a shouting match with Ecuador’s ambassador inside the embassy. The move to expel Assange has been building for months. Last week Defend Assange, a publication of WikiLeaks-linked Courage Foundation, reported:
“On 28 March, Communications Minister Andrés Michelena told CNN Español that the INApapers were part of a plot [by] Julian Assange, Venezuelan President Maduro and former Ecuadorian President Correa to bring down Moreno’s government. [Michelena] added, ‘You have to understand how these people are connected, Mr. Assange is the Troll Center, the hacker for former President Correa, [Assange] handles the technological and social media side.’
That same day, the national assembly, in which Moreno’s party and other right parties command a majority, passed a resolution inviting the Foreign Ministry to take action against Assange’s asylum on the basis of the INApapers leak “in the national interest” if it considers it pertinent to do so.” Supporters of WikiLeaks and Assange rapidly called for an increased presence at the Ecuadorian Embassy, located at Number 3, Hans Crescent in London. Julian Assange’s mother, Christine Assange, tweeted: URGENT
Julian about to be expelled from Embassy into hands of UK (US)!

War … What Is It Good For? (Not the Economy),www.therussophile.org,WashingtonsBlog,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/war-what-is-it-good-for-not-the-economy.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Debunking the Stubborn Myth that War Is Good for the Economy
About.com notes :
One of the more enduring myths in Western society is that wars are somehow good for the economy.
Indeed, bonehead economists periodically pen articles such as “ Progressives Should Learn to Love the Pentagon Budget ” published by Bloomberg last month and “ Defense Spending Would Be Great Stimulus ” published by the Wall Street Journal in 2008.
Let’s debunk the myth … Top Economists Say War Is Bad for the Economy
Nobel prize winning economist Paul Krugman notes :
If you’re a modern, wealthy nation , however, war — even easy, victorious war — doesn’t pay . And this has been true for a long time. In his famous 1910 book “ The Great Illusion ,” the British journalist Norman Angell argued that “military power is socially and economically futile.” As he pointed out, in an interdependent world (which already existed in the age of steamships, railroads, and the telegraph), war would necessarily inflict severe economic harm even on the victor. Furthermore, it’s very hard to extract golden eggs from sophisticated economies without killing the goose in the process .
We might add that modern war is very, very expensive . For example, by any estimate the eventual costs (including things like veterans’ care) of the Iraq war will end up being well over $1 trillion , that is, many times Iraq’s entire G.D.P.
***
Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz agrees that war is bad for the economy :
Stiglitz wrote in 2003:
War is widely thought to be linked to economic good times. The second world war is often said to have brought the world out of depression, and war has since enhanced its reputation as a spur to economic growth. Some even suggest that capitalism needs wars, that without them, recession would always lurk on the horizon. Today, we know that this is nonsense. The 1990s boom showed that peace is economically far better than war. The Gulf war of 1991 demonstrated that wars can actually be bad for an economy .
Stiglitz has also said that [the] Iraq war has been very bad for the economy. See this , this and this .
Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said in that war is bad for the economy. In 1991, Greenspan said that a prolonged conflict in the Middle East would hurt the economy . And he made this point again in 1999:
Societies need to buy as much military insurance as they need, but to spend more than that is to squander money that could go toward improving the productivity of the economy as a whole: with more efficient transportation systems, a better educated citizenry, and so on. This is the point that retiring Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) learned back in 1999 in a House Banking Committee hearing with then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Frank asked what factors were producing our then-strong economic performance. On Greenspan’s list: “The freeing up of resources previously employed to produce military products that was brought about by the end of the Cold War.” Are you saying, Frank asked, “that dollar for dollar, military products are there as insurance … and to the extent you could put those dollars into other areas, maybe education and job trainings, maybe into transportation … that is going to have a good economic effect?” Greenspan agreed .
Economist Dean Baker notes :
It is often believed that wars and military spending increases are good for the economy. In fact, most economic models show that military spending diverts resources from productive uses, such as consumption and investment, and ultimately slows economic growth and reduces employment .
Professor Emeritus of International Relations at the American University Joshua Goldstein notes :
Recurring war has drained wealth, disrupted markets, and depressed economic growth .
***
War generally impedes economic development and undermines prosperity .
And David R. Henderson – associate professor of economics at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California and previously a senior economist with President Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers – writes :
Is military conflict really good for the economy of the country that engages in it? Basic economics answers a resounding “no.” The Proof Is In the Pudding
Mike Lofgren notes :
Military spending may at one time have been a genuine job creator when weapons were compatible with converted civilian production lines, but the days of Rosie the Riveter are long gone. [Indeed, WWII was different from current wars in many ways , and so its economic effects are not comparable to those of today’s wars.] Most weapons projects now require relatively little touch labor. Instead, a disproportionate share is siphoned into high-cost R&D (from which the civilian economy benefits little), exorbitant management expenditures, high overhead, and out-and-out padding, including money that flows back into political campaigns. A dollar appropriated for highway construction, health care, or education will likely create more jobs than a dollar for Pentagon weapons procurement.
***
During the decade of the 2000s, DOD budgets, including funds spent on the war, doubled in our nation’s longest sustained post-World War II defense increase. Yet during the same decade, jobs were created at the slowest rate since the Hoover administration . If defense helped the economy, it is not evident . And just the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan added over $1.4 trillion to deficits, according to the Congressional Research Service . Whether the wars were “worth it” or merely stirred up a hornet’s nest abroad is a policy discussion for another time; what is clear is that whether you are a Keynesian or a deficit hawk, war and associated military spending are no economic panacea.
The Washington Post noted in 2008:
A recent paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research concludes that countries with high military expenditures during World War II showed strong economic growth following the war, but says this growth can be credited more to population growth than war spending. The paper finds that war spending had only minimal effects on per-capita economic activity.
***
A historical survey of the U.S. economy from the U.S. State Department reports the Vietnam War had a mixed economic impact . The first Gulf War typically meets criticism for having pushed the United States toward a 1991 recession.
The Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP) shows that any boost from war is temporary at best. For example, while WWII provided a temporary bump in GDP, GDP then fell back to the baseline trend. After the Korean War, GDP fell below the baseline trend:
IEP notes:
By examining the state of the economy at each of the major conflict periods since World War II, it can be seen that the positive effects of increased military spending were outweighed by longer term unintended negative macroeconomic consequences . While the stimulatory effect of military outlays is evidently associated with boosts in economic growth, adverse effects show up either immediately or soon after, through higher inflation, budget deficits, high taxes and reductions in consumption or investment . Rectifying these effects has required subsequent painful adjustments which are neither efficient nor desirable. When an economy has excess capacity and unemployment, it is possible that increasing military spending can provide an important stimulus. However, if there are budget constraints, as there are in the U.S. currently, then excessive military spending can displace more productive non-military outlays in other areas such as investments in high-tech industries, education, or infrastructure . The crowding-out effects of disproportionate government spending on military functions can affect service delivery or infrastructure development, ultimately affecting long-term growth rates .
***
Analysis of the macroeconomic components of GDP during World War II and in subsequent conflicts show heightened military spending had several adverse macroeconomic effects. These occurred as a direct consequence of the funding requirements of increased military spending. The U.S. has paid for its wars either through debt (World War II, Cold War, Afghanistan/Iraq), taxation (Korean War) or inflation (Vietnam). In each case, taxpayers have been burdened, and private sector consumption and investment have been constrained as a result . Other negative effects include larger budget deficits, higher taxes, and growth above trend leading to inflation pressure . These effects can run concurrent with major conflict or via lagging effects into the future. Regardless of the way a war is financed, the overall macroeconomic effect on the economy tends to be negative . For each of the periods after World War II, we need to ask, what would have happened in economic terms if these wars did not happen? On the specific evidence provided, it can be reasonably said, it is likely taxes would have been lower, inflation would have been lower, there would have been higher consumption and investment and certainly lower budget deficits . Some wars are necessary to fight and the negative effects of not fighting these wars can far outweigh the costs of fighting. However if there are other options, then it is prudent to exhaust them first as once wars do start, the outcome, duration and economic consequences are difficult to predict.
We noted in 2011:
This is a no-brainer, if you think about it. We’ve been in Afghanistan for almost twice as long as World War II. We’ve been in Iraq for years longer than WWII. We’ve been involved in 7 or 8 wars in the last decade. And yet [the economy is still unstable]. If wars really helped the economy, don’t you think things would have improved by now? Indeed, the Iraq war alone could end up costing more than World War II . And given the other wars we’ve been involved in this decade, I believe that the total price tag for the so-called “War on Terror” will definitely support that of the “Greatest War”.
Let’s look at the adverse effects of war in more detail … War Spending Diverts Stimulus Away from the Real Civilian Economy
IEP notes that – even though the government spending soared – consumption and investment were flat during the Vietnam war:
The New Republic noted in 2009:
Conservative Harvard economist Robert Barro has argued that increased military spending during WWII actually depressed other parts of the economy .
(New Republic also points out that conservative economist Robert Higgs and liberal economists Larry Summers and Brad Delong have all shown that any stimulation to the economy from World War II has been greatly exaggerated.)
How could war actually hurt the economy, when so many say that it stimulates the economy?
Because of what economists call the “broken window fallacy”.
Specifically, if a window in a store is broken, it means that the window-maker gets paid to make a new window, and he, in turn, has money to pay others. However, economists long ago showed that – if the window hadn’t been broken – the shop-owner would have spent that money on other things , such as food, clothing, health care, consumer electronics or recreation , which would have helped the economy as much or more .
If the shop-owner hadn’t had to replace his window, he might have taken his family out to dinner, which would have circulated more money to the restaurant, and from there to other sectors of the economy. Similarly, the money spent on the war effort is money that cannot be spent on other sectors of the economy. Indeed, all of the military spending has just created military jobs, at the expense of the civilian economy.
Professor Henderson writes :
Money not spent on the military could be spent elsewhere.This also applies to human resources. The more than 200,000 U.S. military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan could be doing something valuable at home.
Why is this hard to understand? The first reason is a point 19th-century French economic journalist Frederic Bastiat made in his essay, “What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen.” Everyone can see that soldiers are employed. But we cannot see the jobs and the other creative pursuits they could be engaged in were they not in the military.
The second reason is that when economic times are tough and unemployment is high, it’s easy to assume that other jobs could not exist. But they can. This gets to an argument Bastiat made in discussing demobilization of French soldiers after Napoleon’s downfall. He pointed out that when government cuts the size of the military, it frees up not only manpower but also money. The money that would have gone to pay soldiers can instead be used to hire them as civilian workers . That can happen in three ways, either individually or in combination: (1) a tax cut; (2) a reduction in the deficit; or (3) an increase in other government spending.
***
Most people still believe that World War II ended the Great Depression …. But look deeper.
***
The government-spending component of GNP went for guns, trucks, airplanes, tanks, gasoline, ships, uniforms, parachutes, and labor. What do these things have in common? Almost all of them were destroyed. Not just these goods but also the military’s billions of labor hours were used up without creating value to consumers. Much of the capital and labor used to make the hundreds of thousands of trucks and jeeps and the tens of thousands of tanks and airplanes would otherwise have been producing cars and trucks for the domestic economy. The assembly lines in Detroit, which had churned out 3.6 million cars in 1941, were retooled to produce the vehicles of war. From late 1942 to 1945, production of civilian cars was essentially shut down.
And that’s just one example. Women went without nylon stockings so that factories could produce parachutes. Civilians faced tight rationing of gasoline so that U.S. bombers could fly over Germany. People went without meat so that U.S. soldiers could be fed. And so on.
These resources helped win the war—no small issue. But the war was not a stimulus program, either in its intentions or in its effects, and it was not necessary for pulling the U.S. out of the Great Depression. Had World War II never taken place, millions of cars would have been produced; people would have been able to travel much more widely; and there would have been no rationing. In short, by the standard measures, Americans would have been much more prosperous.
Today, the vast majority of us are richer than even the most affluent people back then. But despite this prosperity, one thing has not changed: war is bad for our economy . The $150 billion that the government spends annually on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (and, increasingly, Pakistan) could instead be used to cut taxes or cut the deficit. By ending its ongoing wars … the U.S. government … would be developing a more prosperous economy .
Austrian economist Ludwig Von Mises points out :
That is the essence of so-called war prosperity; it enriches some by what it takes from others. It is not rising wealth but a shifting of wealth and income.
We noted in 2010:
You know about America’s unemployment problem. You may have even heard that the U.S. may very well have suffered a permanent destruction of jobs .
But did you know that the defense employment sector is booming?
[P]ublic sector spending – and mainly defense spending – has accounted for virtually all of the new job creation in the past 10 years:
The U.S. has largely been financing job creation for ten years. Specifically, as the chief economist for BusinessWeek, Michael Mandel, points out, public spending has accounted for virtually all new job creation in the past 1o years:
Private sector job growth was almost non-existent over the past ten years. Take a look at this horrifying chart:
Between May 1999 and May 2009, employment in the private sector only rose by 1.1%, by far the lowest 10-year increase in the post-depression period.
It’s impossible to overstate how bad this is. Basically speaking, the private sector job machine has almost completely stalled over the past ten years. Take a look at this chart:
Over the past 10 years, the private sector has generated roughly 1.1 million additional jobs, or about 100K per year. The public sector created about 2.4 million jobs.
But even that gives the private sector too much credit. Remember that the private sector includes health care, social assistance, and education, all areas which receive a lot of government support.
***
Most of the industries which had positive job growth over the past ten years were in the HealthEdGov sector. In fact, financial job growth was nearly nonexistent once we take out the health insurers.
Let me finish with a final chart.
Without a decade of growing government support from rising health and education spending and soaring budget deficits, the labor market would have been flat on its back. [120]
***
So most of the job creation has been by the public sector. But because the job creation has been financed with loans from China and private banks, trillions in unnecessary interest charges have been incurred by the U.S.
And this shows military versus non-military durable goods shipments: [ Click here to view full image.]
So we’re running up our debt (which will eventually decrease economic growth), but the only jobs we’re creating are military and other public sector jobs.
Economist Dean Baker points out that America’s massive military spending on unnecessary and unpopular wars lowers economic growth and increases unemployment:
Defense spending means that the government is pulling away resources from the uses determined by the market and instead using them to buy weapons and supplies and to pay for soldiers and other military personnel. In standard economic models, defense spending is a direct drain on the economy, reducing efficiency, slowing growth and costing jobs .
A few years ago, the Center for Economic and Policy Research commissioned Global Insight, one of the leading economic modeling firms , to project the impact of a sustained increase in defense spending equal to 1.0 percentage point of GDP. This was roughly equal to the cost of the Iraq War.
Global Insight’s model projected that after 20 years the economy would be about 0.6 percentage points smaller as a result of the additional defense spending . Slower growth would imply a loss of almost 700,000 jobs compared to a situation in which defense spending had not been increased. Construction and manufacturing were especially big job losers in the projections, losing 210,000 and 90,000 jobs, respectively.
The scenario we asked Global Insight [recognized as the most consistently accurate forecasting company in the world] to model turned out to have vastly underestimated the increase in defense spending associated with current policy. In the most recent quarter, defense spending was equal to 5.6 percent of GDP. By comparison, before the September 11th attacks, the Congressional Budget Office projected that defense spending in 2009 would be equal to just 2.4 percent of GDP. Our post-September 11th build-up was equal to 3.2 percentage points of GDP compared to the pre-attack baseline. This means that the Global Insight projections of job loss are far too low…
The projected job loss from this increase in defense spending would be close to 2 million. In other words, the standard economic models that project job loss from efforts to stem global warming also project that the increase in defense spending since 2000 will cost the economy close to 2 million jobs in the long run.
The Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst has also shown that non-military spending creates more jobs than military spending. High Military Spending Drains Innovation, Investment and Manufacturing Strength from the Civilian Economy
Chalmers Johnson notes that high military spending diverts innovation and manufacturing capacity from the economy:
By the 1960s it was becoming apparent that turning over the nation’s largest manufacturing enterprises to the Department of Defense and producing goods without any investment or consumption value was starting to crowd out civilian economic activities. The historian Thomas E Woods Jr observes that, during the 1950s and 1960s, between one-third and two-thirds of all US research talent was siphoned off into the military sector. It is, of course, impossible to know what innovations never appeared as a result of this diversion of resources and brainpower into the service of the military, but it was during the 1960s that we first began to notice Japan was outpacing us in the design and quality of a range of consumer goods, including household electronics and automobiles.
***
Woods writes : “According to the US Department of Defense, during the four decades from 1947 through 1987 it used (in 1982 dollars) $7.62 trillion in capital resources. In 1985, the Department of Commerce estimated the value of the nation’s plant and equipment, and infrastructure, at just over $7.29 trillion… The amount spent over that period could have doubled the American capital stock or modernized and replaced its existing stock ”.
The fact that we did not modernise or replace our capital assets is one of the main reasons why, by the turn of the 21st century, our manufacturing base had all but evaporated . Machine tools, an industry on which Melman was an authority, are a particularly important symptom. In November 1968, a five-year inventory disclosed “that 64% of the metalworking machine tools used in US industry were 10 years old or older. The age of this industrial equipment (drills, lathes, etc.) marks the United States’ machine tool stock as the oldest among all major industrial nations, and it marks the continuation of a deterioration process that began with the end of the second world war. This deterioration at the base of the industrial system certifies to the continuous debilitating and depleting effect that the military use of capital and research and development talent has had on American industry .”
Economist Robert Higgs makes the same point about World War II:
Yes, officially measured GDP soared during the war. Examination of that increased output shows, however, that it consisted entirely of military goods and services. Real civilian consumption and private investment both fell after 1941, and they did not recover fully until 1946. The privately owned capital stock actually shrank during the war . Some prosperity. ( My article in the peer-reviewed Journal of Economic History , March 1992, presents many of the relevant details.)
It is high time that we come to appreciate the distinction between the government spending, especially the war spending, that bulks up official GDP figures and the kinds of production that create genuine economic prosperity. As Ludwig von Mises wrote in the aftermath of World War I , “war prosperity is like the prosperity that an earthquake or a plague brings.” War Causes Austerity
Economic historian Julian Adorney argues :
Hitler’s rearmament program was military Keynesianism on a vast scale. Hermann Goering, Hitler’s economic administrator, poured every available resource into making planes, tanks, and guns. In 1933 German military spending was 750 million Reichsmarks. By 1938 it had risen to 17 billion with 21 percent of GDP was taken up by military spending. Government spending all told was 35 percent of Germany’s GDP.

No-one could say that Hitler’s rearmament program was too small. Economists expected it to create a multiplier effect and jump-start a flagging economy. Instead, it produced military wealth while private citizens starved .
***
The people routinely suffered shortages . Civilian wood and iron were rationed. Small businesses, from artisans to carpenters to cobblers, went under. Citizens could barely buy pork, and buying fat to make a luxury like a cake was impossible. Rationing and long lines at the central supply depots the Nazis installed became the norm.
Nazi Germany proves that curing unemployment should not be an end in itself. War Raises Consumer Interest Rates
Brown University’s Watson Institute notes : The current wars have been paid for almost entirely by borrowing. This borrowing has raised the US budget deficit, increased the national debt, and had other macroeconomic effects, such as raising consumer interest rates . Unless the US immediately repays the money borrowed for war, there will also be future interest payments. Military Spending Worsens Boom-Bust Cycles
Economist Jonathan Askonas notes :
The notion that military spending underwrites a middle-class lifestyle for millions is … off base. It discounts the long-term effects of military spending on the American economy as a whole, as political economy experts increasingly see a dangerous relationship between free-wheeling military spending and boom-bust cycles . War Causes Inflation … Which Keynes and Bernanke Admit Taxes Consumers
As we noted in 2010, war causes inflation … which hurts consumers:
Liberal economist James Galbraith wrote in 2004:
Inflation applies the law of the jungle to war finance. Prices and profits rise, wages and their purchasing power fall. Thugs, profiteers and the well connected get rich. Working people and the poor make out as they can. Savings erode, through the unseen mechanism of the “inflation tax” — meaning that the government runs a big deficit in nominal terms, but a smaller one when inflation is factored in.
***
There is profiteering. Firms with monopoly power usually keep some in reserve. In wartime, if the climate is permissive, they bring it out and use it. Gas prices can go up when refining capacity becomes short — due partly to too many mergers. More generally, when sales to consumers are slow, businesses ought to cut prices — but many of them don’t. Instead, they raise prices to meet their income targets and hope that the market won’t collapse.
Ron Paul agreed in 2007:
Congress and the Federal Reserve Bank have a cozy, unspoken arrangement that makes war easier to finance. Congress has an insatiable appetite for new spending, but raising taxes is politically unpopular. The Federal Reserve, however, is happy to accommodate deficit spending by creating new money through the Treasury Department. In exchange, Congress leaves the Fed alone to operate free of pesky oversight and free of political scrutiny. Monetary policy is utterly ignored in Washington, even though the Federal Reserve system is a creation of Congress.
The result of this arrangement is inflation. And inflation finances war.
Blanchard Economic Research pointed out in 2001:
War has a profound effect on the economy, our government and its fiscal and monetary policies. These effects have consistently led to high inflation.
***
David Hackett Fischer is a Professor of History and Economic History at Brandeis. [H]is book, The Great Wave, Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History … finds that … periods of high inflation are caused by, and cause, a breakdown in order and a loss of faith in political institutions. He also finds that war is a triggering influence on inflation, political disorder, social conflict and economic disruption.
***
Other economists agree with Professor Fischer’s link between inflation and war.
James Grant, the respected editor of Grant’s Interest Rate Observer, supplies us with the most timely perspective on the effect of war on inflation in the September 14 issue of his newsletter:
“War is inflationary. It is always wasteful no matter how just the cause. It is cost without income, destruction financed (more often than not) by credit creation. It is the essence of inflation.”
Libertarian economics writer Lew Rockwell noted in 2008:
You can line up 100 professional war historians and political scientists to talk about the 20th century, and not one is likely to mention the role of the Fed in funding US militarism. And yet it is true: the Fed is the institution that has created the money to fund the wars. In this role, it has solved a major problem that the state has confronted for all of human history. A state without money or a state that must tax its citizens to raise money for its wars is necessarily limited in its imperial ambitions. Keep in mind that this is only a problem for the state. It is not a problem for the people. The inability of the state to fund its unlimited ambitions is worth more for the people than every kind of legal check and balance. It is more valuable than all the constitutions every devised.
***
Reflecting on the calamity of this war, Ludwig von Mises wrote in 1919
One can say without exaggeration that inflation is an indispensable means of militarism. Without it, the repercussions of war on welfare become obvious much more quickly and penetratingly; war weariness would set in much earlier.***
In the entire run-up to war, George Bush just assumed as a matter of policy that it was his decision alone whether to invade Iraq. The objections by Ron Paul and some other members of Congress and vast numbers of the American population were reduced to little more than white noise in the background. Imagine if he had to raise the money for the war through taxes. It never would have happened. But he didn’t have to. He knew the money would be there. So despite a $200 billion deficit, a $9 trillion debt, $5 trillion in outstanding debt instruments held by the public, a federal budget of $3 trillion, and falling tax receipts in 2001, Bush contemplated a war that has cost $525 billion dollars — or $4,681 per household. Imagine if he had gone to the American people to request that. What would have happened? I think we know the answer to that question. And those are government figures; the actual cost of this war will be far higher — perhaps $20,000 per household.
***
If the state has the power and is asked to choose between doing good and waging war, what will it choose? Certainly in the American context, the choice has always been for war.
And progressive economics writer Chris Martenson explains as part of his “Crash Course” on economics:
If we look at the entire sweep of history, we can make an utterly obvious claim: All wars are inflationary. Period. No exceptions.
***
So if anybody tries to tell you that you haven’t sacrificed for the war, let them know you sacrificed a large portion of your savings and your paycheck to the effort, thank you very much.
The bottom line is that war always causes inflation, at least when it is funded through money-printing instead of a pay-as-you-go system of taxes and/or bonds. It might be great for a handful of defense contractors, but war is bad for Main Street, stealing wealth from people by making their dollars worth less.
Given that John Maynard Keynes and former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke both say that inflation is a tax on the American people , war-induced inflation is a theft of our wealth.
IEP gives a graphic example – the Vietnam war helping to push inflation through the roof: War Causes Runaway Debt
We noted in 2010:
All of the spending on unnecessary wars adds up.
The U.S. is adding trillions to its debt burden to finance its multiple wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, etc.
Brown University ‘s Watson Institute states : Through Fiscal Year 2019, the United States federal government has spent or obligated $5.9 trillion dollars on the wars in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq …. This total omits many other expenses … *** We estimate that interest payments could total over $8 trillion by the 2050s.
Indeed, IEP – commenting on the war in Afghanistan and Iraq – notes:
This was also the first time in U.S. history where taxes were cut during a war which then resulted in both wars completely financed by deficit spending . A loose monetary policy was also implemented while interest rates were kept low and banking regulations were relaxed to stimulate the economy. All of these factors have contributed to the U.S. having severe unsustainable structural imbalances in its government finances.
We also pointed out in 2010:
It is ironic that America’s huge military spending is what made us an empire … but our huge military is what is bankrupting us … thus destroying our status as an empire.
Economist Michel Chossudovsky told Washington’s Blog:
War always causes recession. Well, if it is a very short war, then it may stimulate the economy in the short-run. But if there is not a quick victory and it drags on, then wars always put the nation waging war into a recession and hurt its economy.
(and remember Greenspan’s comment .)
It’s not just civilians saying this …
The former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff – Admiral Mullen – agrees :
The Pentagon needs to cut back on spending.
“We’re going to have to do that if it’s going to survive at all,” Mullen said, “and do it in a way that is predictable.”
Indeed, Mullen said :
For industry and adequate defense funding to survive … the two must work together. Otherwise, he added, “this wave of debt” will carry over from year to year, and eventually, the defense budget will be cut just to facilitate the debt.
Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates agrees as well. As David Ignatius wrote in the Washington Post in 2010:
After a decade of war and financial crisis, America has run up debts that pose a national security problem, not just an economic one.
***
One of the strongest voices arguing for fiscal responsibility as a national security issue has been Defense Secretary Bob Gates. He gave a landmark speech in Kansas on May 8, invoking President Dwight Eisenhower’s warnings about the dangers of an imbalanced military-industrial state.
“Eisenhower was wary of seeing his beloved republic turn into a muscle-bound, garrison state — militarily strong, but economically stagnant and strategically insolvent,” Gates said. He warned that America was in a “parlous fiscal condition” and that the “gusher” of military spending that followed Sept. 11, 2001, must be capped . “We can’t have a strong military if we have a weak economy,” Gates told reporters who covered the Kansas speech.
On Thursday the defense secretary reiterated his pitch that Congress must stop shoveling money at the military , telling Pentagon reporters: “The defense budget process should no longer be characterized by ‘business as usual’ within this building — or outside of it.”
While war might make a handful in the military-industrial complex and big banks rich, America’s top military leaders and economists say that would be a very bad idea for the American people.
Indeed, military strategists have known for 2,500 years that prolonged wars are disastrous for the nation. War Increases Inequality … And Inequality Hurts the Economy
Mainstream economists now admit that runaway inequality destroys the economy .
War is great for the super-rich, but horrible for everyone else. Defense contractors, Congress members and bankers love war, because they make huge profits from financing war.
Pulitzer prize winning New York Times reporter James Risen notes that the so-called war on terror has caused “ one of the largest transfers of wealth from public to private hands in American history ,” and created a new class of war profiteers which Risen calls “the oligarchs of 9/11.”
Jonathan Askonas notes :
American military adventurism and massive spending undermines middle-class prosperity and makes the world less free and secure.
***
While military spending might subsidize a middle-class lifestyle for some, it has contributed to macroeconomic trends that are hollowing out the middle class writ large. War Increases Terrorism … And Terrorism Hurts the Economy
Security experts – conservative hawks and liberal doves alike – agree that waging war in the Middle East weakens national security and increases terrorism. See this , this , this , this , this , this and this .
Terrorism – in turn – is bad for the economy. Specifically, a study by Harvard and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) points out:
From an economic standpoint, terrorism has been described to have four main effects (see, e.g., US Congress, Joint Economic Committee, 2002). First, the capital stock (human and physical) of a country is reduced as a result of terrorist attacks. Second, the terrorist threat induces higher levels of uncertainty. Third, terrorism promotes increases in counter-terrorism expenditures, drawing resources from productive sectors for use in security. Fourth, terrorism is known to affect negatively specific industries such as tourism.
The Harvard/NBER concludes:
In accordance with the predictions of the model, higher levels of terrorist risks are associated with lower levels of net foreign direct investment positions, even after controlling for other types of country risks. On average, a standard deviation increase in the terrorist risk is associated with a fall in the net foreign direct investment position of about 5 percent of GDP.
So the more unnecessary wars American launches and the more innocent civilians we kill, the less foreign investment in America, the more destruction to our capital stock, the higher the level of uncertainty, the more counter-terrorism expenditures and the less expenditures in more productive sectors, and the greater the hit to tourism and some other industries. Moreover :
Terrorism has contributed to a decline in the global economy (for example, European Commission, 2001).
So military adventurism increases terrorism which hurts the world economy. And see this .
Attacking a country which controls the flow of oil also has special impacts on the economy. For example, well-known economist Nouriel Roubini says that attacking Iran would lead to global recession . The IMF says that Iran cutting off oil supplies could raise crude prices 30% . War Destroys Freedom … Which, In Turn, Destroys the Economy
In turn, loss of liberty is horrible for the economy . War Causes Us to Lose Friends … And Influence
While World War II – the last “good war” – may have gained us friends, launching military aggression is now losing America friends, influence and prosperity.
U.S. statements that any country that challenges U.S. military – or even economic – hegemony will be attacked are extremely provocative.
U.S. policy towards both China and Russia are very aggressive, which is causing them to launch a policy of “de-dollarization” . This could lead to the collapse of the petrodollar .

After Mueller: Time for True Reset With Russia,www.therussophile.org,Srdja Trifkovic,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/after-mueller-time-for-true-reset-with-russia.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Now that the Russian Collusion Myth has been revealed to be a mendacious conspiracy by the Deep State, the Democratic Party and the media, President Donald Trump needs to move on with his election promise to improve relations with Moscow. That is a geopolitical and civilizational necessity.
It is essential to note that the same neolib-neocon conspiratorial cabal which manufactured the Collusion out of whole cloth also contains America’s morbidly Russophobic heart of darkness. In the print category, according to The New York Post ’s list of media pundits who got it most wrong on Mueller , “the top seed is the never-Trump honcho Bill Kristol.” Last August he predicted that “Mueller will find there was collusion between Trump associates and Putin operatives; that Trump knew about it; and that Trump sought to cover it up and obstruct its investigation.”
As it happens, and as we occasional readers of the late unlamented Weekly Standard well remember, Kristol’s hatred of all things Russian is on par with Hitler’s hatred of all things Jewish. It is to be suspected that the unspeakable “pundit” would be happy to risk an all-out nuclear war just in order to see a hundred million Russians murdered, never mind the consequences for America. Personally I have no doubt that this is the case.
Kristol is closely followed by The Washington Post ’s unspeakable Max Boot. They share the propensity to be wrong on everything, literally so, and the liking for every war, actual or potential, where America’s “engagement” may crack some Serb skulls (in Kristol’s memorable phrase, but Arabs, Persians, Russians etc. will do just as nicely).
With Boot we encounter a carbon copy of Kristol’s pathology: he loathes Trump with a passion and he hates Russia to boot. Last July he wrote, “President Trump’s mantra is ‘no collusion,’ something he says as if sheer, mind-numbing repetition can make it true.” He also routinely calls Russia an international outlaw , guilty of “unprovoked aggression in Georgia and Ukraine,” whose “meddling in U.S. elections and war crimes in Syria demand more punishment.”
The same Trumpophobic-Russophobic twin pathology applies to Anne Applebaum, Joy Behar, Hillary Clinton, Ed Lucas, Rachel “all-roads-lead-to-Moscow” Maddow, Michael “the US does not need Russia for anything” McFaul, Joe Scarborough, Benjamin Wittes . . . The list is long and predictable in its chief contours: All of these people want Trump dead and they also want Russia eradicated from the map, or carved up.
These people’s motives for hating Trump and hating Russia are rooted in rather similar forms of malevolent ideological obsessions. They hate all American deplorables inhabiting the flyover country because they are rather similar to most Russians: white, Christian, non-postmodernized, free from self-hate and morbid introspection, not ashamed of their ancestors, unwilling to surrender their country to alien multitudes, unobsessed by transgender bathrooms, microaggressions, and other “issues” indicative of a society’s moral and intellectual decrepitude.
In order for the real reset in relations with Russia to be possible—and this is, let me repeat, an urgent geopolitical and civilizational necessity—these people need to be fought mercilessly, now that they are down. Trump should go at them hammer and tongs.
The first task is to debunk the Russian Meddling Myth, the Collusion’s twin brother. Who better than Trump to admit that the government of the United States has been the Meddler-in-Chief for decades (Russia’s own elections included), to announce that this practice will stop, and to explain that Russia’s alleged “hack” into Hillary Clinton’s emails was an inside DNC job. Top retired CIA and NSA officials can explain why: among other things because of the speed of its transmission, and because a hack from Russia would have been picked up by NSA grid.
People spewing raw hate and fear-mongering—both on the character and motives of the President of the United States and on the character and intentions of his opposite number in the Kremlin—must be stopped. They are deranged and dangerous: we have not seen anything like the discourse they deploy even in the darkest days of the Cold War.
Over the past two years Trump may have been serious about the Reset, but as we’ve seen after Helsinki last summer the Deep State/media counterpressure proved just too great. A solid rejection front now extends even into his own team (Pence, Pompeo, Bolton . . . ) and has so far inhibited him from making moves that could have appeared influenced by “collusion.” It is time to discard that burden and do the right thing.
The realist assessment is clear: the U.S. and Russia have no “existential” differences, and share many actual and potential commonalities. As I have written before (see Chronicles , May 2017), Russophobic mania prolongs the European civil war which exploded in July 1914, continued in 1939, and has never properly ended . . . not even with the fall of the Berlin Wall. It would be in the American interest, as well as Russia’s and Europe’s, for that conflict to end, so that the existential challenge common to all—that of resurgent jihad and Europe’s demographic crisis—can be properly addressed."
French ocean explorer hopes his experience will help free whales in Russia’s Far East,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/french-ocean-explorer-hopes-his-experience-will-help-free-whales-in-russias-far-east.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
VLADIVOSTOK, April 5. /TASS/. French oceanic researcher Jean-Michel Cousteau’s team has arrived in Russia to try to find a solution to releasing and rehabilitating orcas and beluga whales from Srednyaya Bay in Russia’s Far East.
Jean-Michel Cousteau, who is the first son of famous ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau, told reporters on Friday he hopes that his team’s experience will help solve the problem.
“We are working with everyone who is taking decisions across the world, in such places as Mexico and the United States. We are working with people to understand connection with the ocean and these animals. We have come here <…> to provide assistance and find an appropriate solution,” Cousteau told a briefing in Vladivostok.
The explorer noted that he was thankful for an invitation to come to Primorye. “Based on experience, we put a team together and we will go there [Srednyaya Bay.] We will come to work with scientists and observers and those who work directly with the animals and help them,” he noted.
The Whale Sanctuary Project organization reported in late March that Cousteau had received an invitation from Russia’s authorities to join an operation on rescuing and rehabilitating orcas and beluga whales kept in Srednyaya Bay. The explorer is set to visit the center on April 6.
Eleven orcas had been kept for sale to China in the facility in Srednyaya Bay along with 90 beluga whales. However, three beluga whales went missing, and one orca reportedly disappeared. Police are carrying out an investigation. A criminal case has been launched into illegal hunting of these mammals.
On March 11, members of the council of scientists were approved who will be tasked with assessing the condition of these mammals and prepare recommendations for their rehabilitation. Among them will be representatives of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Far Eastern Federal University, the National Scientific Center for Marine Biology and other scientific organizations. The Russian Scientific-Research Institute of Fishery and Oceanography will coordinate its work.
On March 22, the Primorye Region’s administration and members of the Russian Scientific-Research Institute of Fishery and Oceanography as well as representatives of the companies, which hold the whales in captivity, signed an agreement on cooperation to decide on the fate of the mammals and their possible release back into the wild.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture together with scientific organizations to come up with a solution for the whales.

BUENOS AIRES, April 5. /TASS/. Ecuador’s Foreign Ministry has dismissed as rumors a report that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will be kicked out of the republic’s embassy in London soon, El Comercio newspaper reported.
“Ecuador is not answering rumors, hypotheses or suggestions, which are not confirmed by any documents,” the newspaper quoted a ministry spokesman as saying.
Earlier, WikiLeaks reported citing its sources in Ecuador that Assange would be expelled from the South American republic’s embassy in the UK capital within “hours to days.” According to the organization, Quito and London had reached an agreement on arresting the WikiLeaks founder.
Assange has remained on the premises of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he was granted asylum, since 2012. The WikiLeaks founder tried to avoid extradition to Sweden, which had issued a warrant for his arrest on sexual harassment and rape charges. Assange dismissed the accusations as politically motivated. His worst fear was that Sweden might deport him to the United States, where the Australian could face 35 years in prison or capital punishment for publishing secret documents of the US Department of State. In 2017, the case against him in Sweden was closed, but the UK insists that Assange should be arrested due to his failure to appear in a London court.

BISHKEK, April 5. /TASS/. Kyrgyzstan’s government hopes to bring the annual trade turnover with Russia to $2 bln, Kyrgyz Prime Minister Mukhammedkalyi Abylgaziev said at a Cabinet meeting in Bishkek on Friday.
“The volume of trade with Russia reached $1.6 bln [in 2018], growing by $56 mln, while the volume of direct investment from Russia amounted $123 mln ensuring a 25-percent growth. These figures continue to be insufficient in terms of the existing potential for Kyrgyz-Russian cooperation, and our objective is to increase the volume of trade to $2bln,” he said.
According to the prime minister, there is every precondition for that. “To date, more than 700 joint ventures are working in the country, about 80% of goods are exported to Russia, they are also in demand in other Eurasian Economic Union member-countries,” he said.
Abylgaziev noted that Kyrgyzstan was cooperating most successfully with Russia’s Gazprom energy giant, which invested about 16 bln rubles ($245mln) in the development of the country’s gas transport infrastructure and gasified 30% of the country. “Recently, we held talks with Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller, and our task is to bring the level of gasification to 50%,” he noted.
The prime minister recalled that during the Russian president’s visit to Bishkek on March 28 the two countries signed a cooperation agreement in the oil and gas sector. “A roadmap for cooperation will be drafted to make sure that a strategic investor comes to that sphere. We will make a decision based on how it will contribute to our economy, what social programs will be implemented, how many jobs will be created and how many taxes will be received,” he stressed.
He also criticized the opponents of that agreement. “Those who are opposed to it understand nothing in economic issues or just do not want our oil and gas industry to develop. We will pursue the right policy that will promote the development of the national economy and meet the requirements of law,” he assured.

If members of Congress and in mainstream news outlets from the New York Times to CNN seem to be speaking in unison, reading from the same script with the same talking points, and if the absurd clampdown on the Internet and the tech giants’ mass de-platforming s of those pushing back against this narrative seem to be coordinated, it’s because they are! The populations of Russia, China, Western Europe and the US have been targeted in a rapid-response black propaganda information warfare operation of British Intelligence.
This excellent video put together by Fight Globalism gives us a peak into the concerns of the British power structure expressed in the December 2018 Integrity Initiative report, published by the British House of Lords and promptly leaked by the Anonymous hacking group.
The leaked documents reveal the British role in Spygate (aka RussiaGate), in what technically amounts to an Act of War against the US by a hostile foreign power through an underhanded state-funded influence network, working with Leftists within the US Government to obsessively fight “malign” Russian influence.
The Internet is seen as a major threat to their goals as are people who don’t believe the official explanations of 9/11; who know that the US interventions in Syria and Libya openly supported terrorists; that the 2014 Ukraine coup d’état run by the British in the US State Department had a major Neo-Nazi component. Brexit and Donald Trump are seen as terrifying things that happened because people “knew too much”."

The Veto: Documentary Film Exposing Western Media Propaganda War Against Syria,www.therussophile.org,Vanessa Beeley,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-veto-documentary-film-exposing-western-media-propaganda-war-against-syria.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
I met journalist and friend Rafiq Lutf and cameraman Abdul-Mun’aim Arnous in January 2018 and I was honoured when Rafiq asked me to work with him on his film project, The Veto.
As Dr Shaaban said to me in August 2016, “Western propaganda is paid for in Syrian blood” . This is true. The horrifying bloodshed and loss of life in Syria could never have happened without the colonial media manufacturing consent for another illegal war against a Sovereign nation.
The Veto tracks the evolution of the propaganda campaign waged by Western media against Syria. From Baba Amr in Homs 2011/2012 until the modern day “propaganda construct” – the NATO-member-state funded White Helmets. It honours Russia and China’s vetoes that have consistently defended Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the UN.
George Orwell said “The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.” Western media has been tasked with writing the history of the Syrian conflict to serve the aggressors in the US Coalition of terrorism.
As Dr Shaaban also told me:
“The US alliance and its media are focusing on our history, material history, cultural history, identity, our army. Any power that keeps you as an entire state, or any statesman that represents strength or unity will be demonized and destroyed.”
The Veto exposes the criminal intentions of Western media and it archives the progression of the propaganda war waged by the West against Syria. Syrians are writing the history of the Syrian conflict because Syria and her allies have courageously resisted the Imperialist machine.
As Rafiq has said so eloquently “ we are the Veto” and we must use it against the Industrial Media Complex in the West. Syria’s history belongs to the Syrians and Syria’s final victory must ensure that Western media is never again given the power to destroy a nation, divide its people and promote international terrorism both military and economic.

NATO at 70,www.therussophile.org,Kirkpatrick Sale,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/nato-at-70.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
This month marks the 70th anniversary of the NATO pact, celebrated Thursday with a ceremony in Washington, where the original document was signed in 1949, launching the Cold War.
The ill-named North Atlantic Treaty Organization had Luxembourg and Italy among its original members — neither on the Atlantic — and has expanded over the years to Greece, Turkey (not even in Europe), Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, the three Baltic states, Albania, Croatia, Bulgaria and Montenegro, so that a clear majority of the countries now have nothing at all to do with the Atlantic Ocean. Thus disclosing that the treaty wasn’t about the ocean countries at all, it was about creating a European ring around the Soviet Union and then Russia where America could establish its power and circumscribe the Red and now the Pink menace.
One might argue that its original purpose was to create a Western response to the Warsaw Pact, except that this pact didn’t exist until 1955, and it was created in response to NATO. NATO’s original purpose then was purely and simply to advance the American Empire now that the U.S. was the dominant power in a war-shattered world, and hence we established military bases — 23 Army, 10 Air Force, 6 Navy — throughout NATO territory, with some 70,000 American soldiers stationed there, to so inform the Kremlin.
Human Scale Revisited:… Kirkpatrick Sale Best Price: $9.96 Buy New $17.02 (as of 02:30 EDT – Details ) In one of his early campaign appearances Donald Trump let slip that he thought NATO was no longer useful, a stance that he later thought wise to retract under pressure from the Washington establishment and his neo-con advisers. But in fact it is true, at least in the sense that it was originally useful. We don’t need to surround Russia for fear that it will start gobbling up Eastern Europe and the Baltics because Putin has given no sign that it wants to, and his takeover of Crimea indicated that he wanted to consolidate a greater Russia — it was historically Russian territory and the Russian majority there wanted it — not that he was empire-minded.
Even if it could be argued that NATO has some use in uniting Europe into a military force in case it was ever needed, it doesn’t follow that America should be its linchpin and sugar daddy, as it has been for these 70 years. We have paid out trillions of dollars to NATO — currently we’re paying $680 billion a year, plus another $6 billion for a silly “European Deterence Initiative” created to show our unhappiness with the Crimean takeover, and that makes up some 70 percent of the pact’s budget. Why do we have to be the protector of a Europe that is perfectly capable of defending itself? What on earth do we get out of it?
And what might we do if we stopped paying those sums to Europe? What might we do if we stopped funneling billions to those 39 bases and brought those 70,000 soldiers home? Seems to me that it would make sense to invest that money at home and maybe put those troops to work repairing the U.S. infrastructure — or even building that bloody wall.
The truth is, we are today in the difficult economic straits we are in ($22 trillion in debt) and the chaotic foreign policy mess we are in because we are trying to maintain an empire when the need for that empire has vanished and the attempt to maintain it does nothing except beef up a military-industrial leviathan and make us enemies wherever we go. Let’s shut down not just those 39 European bases but the other 750 or so we maintain around the world, plus the acknowledged five wars that we are fighting — we’ve learned by now that they are unnecessary and incite more blowback than admiration and respect, and they certainly do nothing to advance “democracy.”
You know, make America first again, get on with the business of healing our riven nation and repairing its badly damaged transportation systems. And to pay for all that we will have the $100 billion a year we spend on our overreach and the $200 billion we squander on futile wars.
We will give up trying to be the world’s policeman. We will give up trying to implant our version of democracy everywhere we think it is badly needed. We will not behave as if it’s our job to deprive North Korea of a nuclear deterrent system that it feels it needs to defend itself in ways that Libya’s Khaddafi failed to do. Not our job to send provocative naval fleets to the China Sea to prove to China that we still have a mighty Navy. Not our job to overthrow a corrupt regime in Venezuela, beef up a fascist oligarchy in Ukraine, help Saudi Arabia fight a proxy war against Iran in Yemen.
The “again” to which we might make America great is the one we had before we decided to become an empire. A withdrawal from NATO on April 4 would be a good start along that road."
South Asia’s Nuclear-Armed Neighbors,www.therussophile.org,No Author,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/south-asias-nuclear-armed-neighbors.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
It’s still the most dangerous border on Earth. Yet compared to the recent tweets of President Donald Trump, it remains a marginal news story. That doesn’t for a moment diminish the chance that the globe’s first (and possibly ultimate) nuclear conflagration could break out along that 480-mile border known as the Line of Control (and, given the history that surrounds it, that phrase should indeed be capitalized). The casus belli would undoubtedly be the more than seven-decades-old clash between India and Pakistan over the contested territory of Kashmir. Like a volcano, this unresolved dispute rumbles periodically — as it did only weeks ago — threatening to spew its white-hot lava to devastating effect not just in the region but potentially globally as well.
The trigger for renewed rumbling is always a sensational terrorist attack by a Pakistani militant group on an Indian target. That propels the India’s leadership to a moral high ground. From there, bitter condemnations of Pakistan are coupled with the promise of airstrikes on the training camps of the culprit terrorist organizations operating from the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir. As a result, the already simmering relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbors are quickly raised to a boiling point. This, in turn, prompts the United States to intervene and pressure Pakistan to shut down those violent jihadist groups. To placate Washington, the Pakistani government goes through the ritual of issuing banning orders on those groups, but in practice, any change is minimal.
And in the background always lurks the possibility that a war between the two neighbors could lead to a devastating nuclear exchange. Which means that it’s time to examine how and why, by arraying hundreds of thousands of troops along that Line of Control, India and Pakistan have created the most perilous place on Earth.

How It All Began
The Kashmir dispute began with the birth of the kicking twins — Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan — as independent countries. They emerged from the belly of the dying British Raj in August 1947. The princely states in British India were given the option of joining either of the new nations. The dithering Hindu ruler of Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir (its full title) finally signed a legally binding instrument of accession with New Delhi after his realm was invaded by armed tribal raiders from Pakistan. This document offered that state’s citizens the chance to choose between the two countries once peace had been restored. This has not happened so far and there is no credible prospect that it will.
After the 1947-1948 Indo-Pakistani War that followed independence, India was left in control of almost two-thirds of the princely state (18% of which it lost to China in the Sino-Indian War of 1962). Crucially, the 45% of the former princely state that remained in its hands included the Vale of Kashmir. Guarded by snow-capped mountain peaks, covered with verdant forests of fir and pine, carpeted by wild flowers in the spring, and irrigated by the Jhelum River, it has been described by poets and others as “paradise on Earth.” Its population of seven million is 96% Muslim. And it is this territory that is coveted by Pakistan.
In 1989, having secured the withdrawal of the Soviet army from Afghanistan after a 10-year struggle, some of the Afghan Mujahedin (“Holy Warriors”), including Pakistani militants, turned their attention to liberating Indian-controlled Kashmir. In this, they had the active backing of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, or ISI, of Pakistan’s army. Earlier, the ISI had acted as the conduit for channeling U.S. and Saudi-supplied weapons and cash to the Mujahedin coalition.
At that time, the two Pakistani groups in the Mujahedin coalition, which always harbored an anti-Indian agenda, emerged front and center. They were the Jaish-e Mohammad (Army of Mohammad) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (Army of the Righteous), led respectively by Masoud Azhar and Hafiz Saeed. Working with those Kashmiris who wanted their state to secede from India, they soon began to resort to terrorist acts.
The Indian government responded with draconian measures. In July 1990, it passed the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, or AFJKSP, a law that authorized the state government to declare any part of Jammu and Kashmir a “disturbed area,” where the Indian army would be free to shoot anyone acting in contravention of “any law” or in possession of a deadly weapon. Indian forces could now arrest people suspected of committing any offense without a warrant or enter and search any premises to make such arrests. In other words, from then on, the armed forces had carte blanche legal immunity to do whatever they wished without the slightest accountability.
Yet resistance to Indian rule did not subside. In fact, the slogan “ Azadi ” (Freedom) caught on, emboldening both terror groups to jointly launch an audacious attack on the Indian Parliament building on December 20, 2001, with the aim of taking lawmakers hostage. (They were bravely blocked by armed guards.) In the crisis that followed, the mobilized armies of the two neighbors, each already a declared nuclear power, faced off across their international border and the Line of Control in Kashmir. Pressured by Washington, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf banned the two terror organizations in January 2002. Yet both of them soon resurfaced under different names.
In June 2002, at a regional conference in the Kazakh city of Almaty, Musharraf assailed then-Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for ignoring the wishes of the Kashmiri people. “The possession of nuclear weapons by any state obviously implies they will be used under some circumstances,” he stated grimly, refusing to commit his country (as India had) to a “no first use” policy on nuclear arms. Vajpayee accused him of “nuclear blackmail.” At home, however, Musharraf’s hardline stance was applauded by the militant groups.
Over the years, the crisis only deepened. In November 2008, for instance, working with the ISI, the operatives of Lashkar-e-Taiba attacked Mumbai’s landmark Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and two other inns. After a 60-hour siege , 166 people, including 28 foreigners, were dead. Despiteinitial denials, Pakistan would finally acknowledge that the Mumbai conspiracy was, in part, hatched on its soil, and place Lashkar-e-Taiba leader Saeed under house arrest. But no charges would be leveled against him and he would, in the end, be released.
After the Mumbai carnage, Jaish-e Mohammad’s chief, Azhar, kept a low profile for several years, only to reappear publicly in 2014, issuing fiery calls for more attacks on India (and the United States as well). In September 2016, his fighters stormed an army camp in Uri, an Indian garrison town near the Line of Control, killing 19 soldiers.
With the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, under Narendra Modi gaining power in New Delhi in 2014, repression of the Muslim separatist movement in Kashmir only intensified. Within three years, the number of security personnel — army troops, paramilitaries, border guards, federal armed policemen, state policemen, and intelligence agents — had reached 470,000 in Jammu and Kashmir, which had a population of only 14.1 million . As a result, the proportion of local Kashmiris among anti-Indian fighters only rose .
A Sensational Terrorist Attack
This February 14th, a 19-year-old suicide bomber, Adil Ahmad Dar, drove a car bomb into an Indian convoy heading for Kashmir’s capital city, Srinagar. At least 40 Indian paramilitary troops were killed — the worst such attack in the troubled history of the state. Jaish-e Mohammad proudly claimed responsibility.
After dropping out of his village school, Dar had gone to work in a neighbor’s sawmill. During a four-month-long protest sparked by the killing of a popular 22-year-old local militant leader, Burhan Wani, in July 2016, Indian troops gunned down nearly 100 protestors, while injuring 15,000, including Dar. In response, he crossed the Line of Control and joined Jaish-e Mohammad. In the wake of his suicide attack, Indian soldiers raided the home of his parents, locked them inside, and set it on fire. And so it continues in the officially “disturbed” Kashmir.
In response to the deaths of the soldiers (and keenly aware of an upcoming nationwide election), Prime Minister Modi exploited the situation for political ends. He turned popular grief into an emotive and prolonged commemoration of those military deaths. TV networks focused on the flag-draped coffins of the slain troops, while local BJP candidates followed their hearses. The cremations were telecast live, while Modi proclaimed that “the security forces have been given complete freedom. The blood of the people is boiling.”
On February 26th, temporarily released from civilian control, the Indian military launched a “pre-emptive” air strike on an alleged Jaish-e Mohammad training camp near Balakot, six miles inside Pakistan’s Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. The last time the air forces of either country had crossed the international border was during their 1971 war.
India claimed to have killed more than 300 militants, but Islamabad reported that the Indian bombs had actually hit a totally deserted site. (This would be confirmed later by satellite analysis from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute which concluded that no damage had been done to the hilltop facility India claimed to have struck.) The next day Pakistan announced that, in a dogfight between warplanes of the two countries, an Indian fighter jet had been shot down and its pilot, Abhinandan Varthaman, captured.
India angrily demanded that he be set free immediately. On February 28th, while announcing the pilot’s release during a televised address, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan warned against miscalculation and the explosive potential for such aerial skirmishes to escalate into a wider conflict in the most dangerous environment on the planet. He said , “With the weapons you have and the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation? Shouldn’t we think that, if this escalates, what will it lead to?”
This was a barely disguised reference to the devastating nuclear arsenals that the two South Asian neighbors now possess , with 135 nukes in New Delhi’s possession and 145 in Islamabad’s. Those arsenals are more than capable of causing havoc far beyond South Asia. It’s estimated that even a “moderate” Indo-Pakistani nuclear conflict could create a global “nuclear winter,” killing directly or indirectly up to a billion people as crops failed and starvation stalked the Earth.
Those Nuclear Arsenals
Pakistan’s arsenal now includes tactical nuclear weapons (TNWs) with “low” explosive power for battlefield use. In 2011, it tested its first one successfully. Since then, according to Professor Rajesh Rajagopalan, author of Nuclear South Asia: Keywords and Concepts , Pakistan is believed to have assembled four or five of these annually. They are to be fired from the Nasr, a short-range missile. Two successful tests of it were conducted this January.
Islamabad began producing and deploying TNWs after India adopted a “Cold Start” military contingency plan to punish unacceptable Pakistani provocations like mass-casualty terror strikes. After repeated denials, in early 2017, India’s army chief finally acknowledged the existence of the plan, involving the creation of eight division-size integrated battle groups (IBGs). Each is to consist of infantry, artillery, armor, and air support and is to be able to operate independently on the battlefield. In response to major terrorist attacks from Pakistan or by Pakistani-based groups, the IBGs are to rapidly penetrate that country at unexpected locations and advance up to 30 miles beyond the border, disrupting command-and-control networks while trying to avoid locations likely to trigger nuclear retaliation. In other words, the goal is to be able to launch an overwhelming conventional strike swiftly but in a limited fashion in order to ward off a Pakistani nuclear response. Overall, India’s contingency plan assumes unrealistically that, in the heat of the battle, leaders on both sides will remain calm and rational.
Responding to Islamabad’s production of theater nuclear weapons, New Delhi initiated a super-secret nuclear program revealed only in December 2015, thanks to an investigation by the Washington-based Center for Public Integrity. A top-secret, government-run, $100 million rare materials plant near the city of Mysore in southern India now houses a nuclear enrichment complex that has been operating since 2012. It feeds the country’s nuclear weapons program and, far more ominously, has laid the foundation for an ambitious Indian hydrogen bomb project.
To consternation in world capitals, it was also revealed that this plant has a larger twin 160 miles north of Mysore in southern India that goes by the innocuous name of the Aeronautical Test Range . Conceived in March 2007 by the defense ministry, its construction started in 2012 on nearly 13 square miles of land. It is to become the subcontinent’s largest military-run complex of nuclear centrifuges, atomic-research laboratories, and weapons- and aircraft-testing facilities after its completion in 2020. Among the project’s aims is to expand the government’s nuclear research, to produce fuel for the country’s nuclear reactors, and to help power its fleet of new nuclear submarines. This nuclear city is to be protected by a ring of military garrisons, turning the site into a virtual military facility, which also means that it will not be open to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Its overarching aim is to give the country an extra stockpile of enriched uranium fuel that could be used to create hydrogen bombs and so further enhance the power of India’s already devastating nuclear arsenal.
Both of these projects are directed by the office of the prime minister. India’s Atomic Energy Act and its Official Secrets Act have placed everything linked to the country’s nuclear program under wraps. In the past, those who tried to find out more about these activities were bludgeoned into silence.
According to Gary Samore, an Obama-era White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction, “India intends to build thermonuclear weapons as part of its strategic deterrent against China. It is unclear when India will realize this goal of a larger and more powerful arsenal, but they will.” Once manufactured, however, nothing would block India from deploying them against Pakistan. “India is now developing very big bombs, hydrogen bombs that are city-busters,” commented Pakistani nuclear physicist Pervez Hoodbhoy. “It is not interested in [producing] nuclear weapons for use on the battlefield; it is developing nuclear weapons for eliminating population centers.”
In other words, while India has long been in a nuclear arms race with Pakistan, it is no longer sticking to the same race course. In late March, Modi announced that India recently launched a rocket successfully shooting down one of its satellites. This creates the possibility that, in a future nuclear war with Pakistan, it could preemptively “blind” the Pakistanis by destroying their space-based communication and surveillance satellites. A race of another kind could be in the offing.
The central motive that drove Pakistan to develop its nuclear arsenal, however, remains unchanged. It was the only way Islamabad could deter New Delhi from defeating it in a war waged with conventional weapons. India’s 2.14 million-strong military , equipped with 5,967 artillery pieces, 4,500 tanks, and 2,216 aircraft, is significantly larger and better armed than Pakistan’s 1.55 million soldiers, 3,745 artillery, 2,700 tanks, and 1,143 aircraft. In addition, New Delhi’s annual defense budget of $55.9 billion is more than five times Islamabad’s $10.8 billion.
Little wonder that, in his February 28th televised address, while announcing the Indian pilot’s release, Prime Minister Khan suggested that the two sides “should sit down and resolve our problems through dialogue.” He claimed that his own political party, Pakistan Tahreek-e-Insaf (the Pakistan Movement for Justice), and the country’s powerful military were “all on one page” in wishing to mend fences with India.
Pakistan’s Belated Suppression of Violent Jihadists
In late February, India handed over to Pakistan a dossier with information on Jaish-e Mohammad, its top leadership, and their involvement in several terror attacks. Islamabad initially said that the dossier was being “examined.” However, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi added that his government could act against Masoud Azhar only if New Delhi provided “solid, inalienable evidence” strong enough to convince the country’s judiciary.
And yet on March 8th, the Pakistani government acted, launching a crackdown on leading terrorist groups. Among other things, it outlawed the Jamaat-ud Dawa (Society of the Islamic Call), or JuD, a welfare organization that raised funds for Lashkar-e-Taiba. It sealed the banned organization’s headquarters in Lahore as well as more than 200 schools, seminaries, and hospitals it ran. It also banned its chief, Hafiz Saeed, from leading Friday prayers on the sprawling JuD complex and kept him under surveillance.
One key factor that spurred such action was a warning the Pakistani government received on February 22nd from the Paris-based intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF). It threatened to add Pakistan to its blacklist of non-cooperating countries if, by May, it failed to take specific steps against the financing of terrorism. To be added to the FATF blacklist could mean being sanctioned by most Western nations, a development only likely to deepen Islamabad’s current financial crisis. (Recently, it has had barely enough foreign reserves to pay for two months of imports or service a huge loan it secured from the International Monetary Fund in 2013.)
In January 2018, President Donald Trump had already cancelled plans for Washington to give Pakistan $1.3 billion in military aid and had imposed sanctions on the country for its support of terrorist groups, including the Afghan Taliban. On Twitter, he accused Pakistan of “providing nothing but lies and deceit.” Soon after, the FATF placed Pakistan on its “gray list.”
Still, none of that proved sufficient to compel Pakistan’s powerful military high command to cede its traditional monopoly on national security and foreign policy decision-making, including its covert backing of anti-Indian extremist groups through the ISI. Only when pressure continued to build, bolstered by fresh urging from Washington, London, and Paris, was a critical mass reached that made those generals finally fall in line with recently elected Prime Minister Khan’s more conciliatory stance toward India.
Now, the international community can only hope that the carnage and chaos of February was the last in a tragic series of encounters between nuclear neighbors that could otherwise lead South Asia to devastation and the world to nuclear winter.

Since 2016 the United States has been in the Russiagate box, a hoax created by the US military/security complex to prevent President Trump from normalizing relations with Russia. Normalized relations would devalue THE RUSSIAN THREAT, an orchestration that protects the $1,000 billion annual budget of the military/security complex.
The Democratic Party, which most certainly is not democratic, supported the hoax hoping to do Trump in for their own reasons and pulled the presstitute media into the conspiracy against Trump.
Now that all the assurances from the Establishment that Trump was a traitor to America who conspired with Russian President Putin to steal the election from the killer-bitch in order that America could serve Russian interests have been exposed as lies by the Mueller report, American attention is free to take up some other nonsensical campaign. The succession of these stupidities is destroying America’s reputation.
True, some of the most crazed of the Democrats and media whores cannot let go of Russiagate. The presstitutes are saying that Trump would be impeached for his non-crime except the unworthy Democrats had rather go back to the business of spending other people’s money. A crazed professor or two have declared that Mueller was part of the “Trump coverup” and that Mueller needs to be investigated. But these claims simply underline that the United States wasted three years of its existence.

Meanwhile, other countries moved on. The Russians, for example, discovered that Washington’s sanctions had a silver lining. Russia became more self-sufficient economically and moved out of the box of being an exporter of raw materials to the West, a box into which the Americans and the American-brainwashed Russian economics profession had put the Russian government.
The fulminations and threats from Washington against Russia brought forth new Russian weapon systems for which the US has no match or defense, weapons that demote the US to a second-rate military power.
On an adjusted basis, China now has the world’s largest economy and increasingly ignores Washington’s blustering. As does Iran.
Even Venezuela stands up to Washington.
The world is concluding that Washington is not the power it thinks it is.
Washington’s abuse of its reserve currency role and violations of international law have encouraged a movement away from the use of the dollar in international transactions. This is perhaps even a more serious threat to Washington’s power than Russia’s superior military capabilities.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt was happy to see World War II because he understood that it would leave Britain bankrupt and without an empire. Roosevelt understood that the gain would be America’s, because the US would take over the reserve currency role. The reason this is important is that the reserve currency country can pay its bills by printing money. Thus, the government has no budget constraints.
For a country as indebted as America, to lose this role would be a crushing blow. It is this blow that Washington faces as a result of its idiotic policy of sanctions and disrespect of international law.
And there is another blow. Just as the Roman Empire fell to invaders who crossed the frontiers of the empire, so is Washington’s empire falling. Europe, the crown jewel of the empire, is now overrun with millions of unassimilable peoples to the extent that Europe is no longer European. The President of the US has so far been powerless to defend the borders of the United States. Indeed, the Democratic Party and the presstitute media are totally opposed to any defense of American borders. Why does a government unwilling to defend its borders spend $1,000 billion annually on defense?
The American Neoconservative Zionists, who have controlled US foreign policy in Israel’s interest since the Clinton regime, continue to operate as if we still live in an unipolar world. For some reason the National Security Advisor to President Trump has poor sources of information. He speaks as if he rules the world, but even Washington’s pathetic European vassals did not go along with Trump’s gift of the Syrian Golan Heights to Israel.
As for moral authority, after, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yeman, Ukraine, Honduras, and now Venezuela, all moral authority has vacated the West.
Washington is not only losing its economic and military power but also its soft power that rested in Washington’s propaganda about making the world safe for democracy. Democracy is not even safe in the United States as Democrats and the presstitutes have done their best to overturn democracy and to drive the elected president from office, which is precisely what the Trump regime is trying to do to Venezuela.
All of the lies and propaganda that have portrayed the West as God’s gift to humanity have fallen away as the result of Washington’s irresponsible use of power, leaving the West morally naked.
The world no longer thinks that the West is something to look up to and to emulate. Instead, the world sees a great evil, in the words of Matt Taibbi, “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.”
A great promise was betrayed by those trusted with the promise. A government accountable to law and to the people requires a united people, not the disunity of multiculturalism and Identity Politics. With the indigenous ethnic base of all of the Western countries under attack as “white supremacists,” the West can no longer defend its culture from the immigrants who do not share the culture.

The tension between an indigenous culture and imported cultures can be seen in the tensions between Hungary and the EU and Italy and the EU. Hungary has refused to accept its quota of non-European immigrants and faces punishment by the EU. In Italy the government is in the hands of a coalition of leftwing and rightwing parties that are united in their opposition to the EU and non-European immigration. In Europe the situation is one in which the EU government, as well as the governments of member states such as France and Germany, have taken the side of immigrants against the indigenous people. In other words, the governments of Europe are not committed to their own cultures. This is the unmistakable sign of a dead culture.
In the United States there is so much disunity that to call the states united is a misuse of words. Hillary voters hate Trump voters, and vice versa. The presstitute media and universities are uniformly anti-white.
Countries without unity are not strong. Consequently, the Western world is losing its leadership of the world.
Of course, the rest of the world also suffers from disunity. The Sunni and the Shiites cannot unite, with the consequence that the Muslim world is weak. The tribes in Africa cannot unite. India and Pakistan stay at each other’s throats. Animosities exist among Asians. Russia herself is a federation. China has a Muslim province. But the disunities are different from those in the West. Japan and China have differences but the population of Japan is homogeneous and China largely is. Arabs are Arabs whether Sunni or Shiite. The Russian Federation is the remains of an old empire, largely assimilated, not the result of recent immigrations.
The consequence of disunity perhaps precludes any leadership. But the collapse of the West into diversity and multiculturalism definitely means that Western leadership has been lost to the weakness of disunity.
Is it chaos that awaits?"
Religion And The Simulation Hypothesis: Is God An AI?,www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/religion-and-the-simulation-hypothesis-is-god-an-ai.html/,"Authored by Riz Virk via HackerNoon.com, Do Video Games and the Matrix provide a scientific basis for religious beliefs? (part 1)
For hundreds of years, many well-known scientists weren’t afraid to speak of God (or the importance of consciousness) in their writings, ranging from Newton to Descartes to Einstein. This may partly have sprung initially from not wanting to share the fate of scientists like Galileo whose research was suppressed by a dominant Catholic Church. Over time, though as the Church became less dominant, I suspect it stemmed from a genuine belief that while science was good at making observations, its reductionist tendencies might never be able to explain the unseen worlds of consciousness often explored by religion. As a result, scientists have steered clear of religion as something that is “not scientific” and should only be studied by sociologists.
Recently, a theory has emerged which is causing a lot of scientists to look again at age-old religious concepts, and both video games and science fiction have provided a key part of this new model. This theory, the simulation hypothesis , is the idea that what we perceive as physical reality is actually a computer-generated simulation — like a super sophisticated video game, as depicted in the movie the Matrix.
This month marks the 20th anniversary of the release of this groundbreaking film. While the film had many religious overtones (the emergence of a Messiah to save the human race), it emerged as cultural phenomenon beyond most other films of its day because of its central thesis: that we live in a simulated world and that there is another world beyond what we can see.
This is the first of two articles that examine how many of the ideas put forth by the World’s religions -both Eastern and Western — are not only consistent with the simulation hypothesis, but that this new theory may find a way to bridge the ever-widening gap between religion and science. Part I will focus on the Western religions, specifically God and his Angels and the idea of an afterlife, while Part II will focus on the Eastern religions, specifically about the idea of maya, or illusion, karma and reincarnation.
We’ll see how these religious ideas take on a whole new meaning when viewed through the lens of the simulation hypothesis. In fact, this theory may provide a scientific and technological basis for all of these arguments, showing that the unseen worlds described by the world’s religions may be more scientific than we thought!
Does the Matrix show us a scientific model for religions? The Matrix, its Religious Overtones and its Central Idea
To recap, in The Matrix, Neo (played by Keanu Reeves), is a computer hacker who discovers mysterious references to something called “the Matrix” online. He eventually meets Morpheus (played by Laurence Fishburne) who explains: “Unfortunately, no one can be told what The Matrix is. You’ll have to see it for yourself.”
Even if you haven’t seen the movie, you’ve probably heard of its most iconic scene: Morpheus gives Neo a choice to take “red pill” to wake up and see what the Matrix is, or take the “blue pill” and keep living his life. Neo takes the red pill and wakes up in the real world to find that what he thought was reality was actually a sophisticated computer simulation — basically an ultra-realistic video game! Video Games, Virtual Reality and the idea of a Simulated World
The simulation hypothesis was once the domain of science fiction (the creators of the Matrix, the Wachowski’s, claimed to have been inspired by the work of science fiction writer Philip K. Dick among others).
Today, this idea is taken seriously by scholars of philosophy (Oxford’s Nick Bostrom laid out the Simulation Argument in a 2003 paper), physicists (Neil deGrasse Tyson, host of the new Cosmos, and the late Stephen Hawking both took the idea seriously), and most of all by today’s computer scientists.
Why is this idea being taken more seriously now? It’s because of the evolution of video games and AI technology. In fact Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX founder, made waves with his statement in 2016 explaining the logic: Forty years ago, the state of the art in video gaming was two lines and a dot, in Pong, which was the first widely available arcade game. Today’s MMORPGS (massively multiplayer online role-playing games) like World of Warcraft and Fortnite , have created shared virtual worlds inhabited by characters controlled by millions of players.
If the fidelity of virtual reality and augmented reality continues to improve, Musk speculated, that we will soon be unable to distinguish between “physical” and “virtual reality”.
While the scientists like Bostrom said little about video games, and Musk said little about uploading and downloading of consciousness, if we take these trend to their logical conclusion, we end up at a point where the simulation hypothesis sounds a lot like what all the religious traditions have been telling us all along! Western Central Tenet #1: And God Said: Let there Be Light!
Let’s start with the Western traditions (namely, Judaism, Christianity and Islam), or as they are referred to the Abrahamic line of religions. They share many traits, not the least of which is respect for the Old Testament, the oldest part of the Bible.
Genesis from the Old Testament, begins with God saying: “Let there be light, and then there was light.” This is followed by the revelation that God created the Earth in 6 days and then rested on the 7th.
This is of course one of the areas that’s ridiculed by scientists the most. Of course, it takes more than 6 days to form a planet, doesn’t it? Our best estimates are that the Earth is billions of years old. Moreover, if the Earth wasn’t yet created, how could you possibly measure a period of 6 days?
With the introduction of the simulation hypothesis, however, this part of genesis starts to take on new meaning. If we begin to think about the physical world as a computer-generated reality, rather than a physical reality, then this description doesn’t sound so outlandish to scientists. In the world of video games, it can take about 6 seconds to “spin up” a new server or new planet inside a video game world. The groundbreaking video game, No Man’s Sky , used fractal algorithms to generate unique flora and fauna for 18 quintillion planets. All computer programs, including simulations have the idea of clockspeed — which is the minimum time increment that a particular step can take. Even though we might think of it as instant, it takes some amount of time to generate any simulated world.
Time increments inside simulated worlds are set by some “generation” or “step” which is a multiple of the underlying clockspeed of the CPU. For example, if the internal clock speed was 1 millisecond, then it would be impossible to measure less than 1 millisecond. But within a simulation, a “day” or “year” or “step” could be 6 milliseconds or 6000.
Perhaps more important is the action taken by God to create the world — in religious traditions, light seems to have a special status.
Figure 1: Light plays a fundamental role in Religion, Physics and Video Games
As we look at modern physics, we have found that everything we thought of as the physical world has been proven to be mostly (99%) empty space. Solids vs. liquids vs. gasses are just collections of atoms and molecules moving differently. This lends credence to the idea that the physical universe really doesn’t exist — what exists is an arrangement of information that represents the atoms and the molecules.
Einstein’s theory of relativity found that that only true constant in physics is light. Light is special, though no one knows why. In fact, you might say that light is the only true “fundamental” in physics. We haven’t been able to figure out why.
Within computer simulations also, light is also special. In fact, computer graphics consists of pixels based on information — these pixels are “rendered” into the physical world that exists inside the game — what I like to call “The Rendered World”. The rendering is all about lighting up pixels based on different values to present different colors — to turn a dark screen into a “world”!
Why would the only fundamental in physics be the speed of electromagnetic radiation, which is also the speed at which we send signals inside and between computers? Moreover, the Western religions are telling us explicitly that God created the world in the same way that we would render a video game world — by “turning on the lights” of the pixels of the physical world? Western Central Tenet #2: Angels and the Afterlife in Video Games
Most religions are concerned with what happens to us after death. In fact, you might say that this is the central issue and main reason to have religion in the first place! In the Western religious traditions, one of the main teachings is that we have an immortal soul which is judged based upon our actions in this life. This judgement is based on reviewing what we do in the “here” in the physical world, and this behavior determines where we end up in the “hereafter”, or the afterlife.
Depending on which particular branch of the Western traditions we are looking at, there are variations on this same basic theme (purgatory for example in the Catholic Church vs the Eastern orthodox). In pretty much of all of these cases, there is what we might call Heaven and Hell. In Judaism (again depending on specific interpretations) there is Heaven which is Gen Eden (the Garden of Eden), and Hell which is called Gen Hanum . In Islam, Heaven is called Jannah ( basically the Garden of Milk and Honey ) , and as if to emphasize it’s the same place as the Old Testament, Hell uses almost exactly the same phrase: Jahannam .
How is this determination done exactly? In Islam, which is the newest of these religions, we are given more specifics. In the Koran (and the Hadith, the second most authoritative text), it specifically mentions that each of us has a “Scroll of Deeds”. Not only does God review our Scroll of Deeds with us after death, but he also shows us the consequences of our actions. Because we may not even realize that some of our deeds had repercussions beyond what we know, this is not a simple process but requires broadening our perspective.
Figure 2: A Depiction of a Recording Angel from Washington DC
Who is recording information in this scroll of deeds, and how is it shown to us? In Islam, the recording angels, the Kiramin Kitab are two angels which record our “good deeds” and “bad deeds”. Now you may have seen the modern cartoons which show an angel and a devil on each shoulder. It turns out the source of this picture is most likely the Islamic traditions, where the prophet tells the faithful that each person has two entities — an angel and a jinn, one on each shoulder which are there to guide us towards good or bad deeds.
In the Christian traditions, the recording angel is the same as our guardian angels, and in both the Christian and Jewish traditions, the “Book of Life” is substituted for the “Scroll of Deeds” (in one case it is simply a list of those who get into heaven, in other traditions it is pretty much the same as the Scroll of Deeds).
Could this really be happening — our deeds and their repercussions beings recorded somewhere (outside the rendered world) by Angels (or literally, messengers of God), and if so, how would it work?
Figure 3: Are Angels Really AI daemons? A Disney representation
More importantly, what does all this have to do with video games and the Matrix?
It turns out quite a lot! It’s obvious that as we go through life, there is a “score” which is clearly visible to the angels (who are not in our physical reality but can see everything that is going on). You might say they are scorekeepers of a video game that we cannot see inside the “rendered world”.
Moreover, how would you record good deeds and bad deeds in a three-dimensional world? Again, video games give us the answer. In eSports video games today, key moves are recorded while the game is being played, by commentators who are outside the rendered world, watching it. Usually this is done automatically using screen capture software and sometimes streamed live.
Could these recording angels actually be some form of AI? Is it likely that with 7 billion of us on this planet, there are 14 billion angels whose simple job it is to record everything we do? Modern computer science provides the answer — it makes sense for AI to act like an automated screen capture which records the important points in our games and then plays it back to us.
Recently, I was part of a video game company which not only recorded key moments inside a 3d MMORPGs like World of Warcraft and League of Legends. it could play back the key moments so that we could review what we did right and what we did wrong. What was unique about this 3D recording was we could play it back the game not just from the point of view of the original player’s character, but from the point of view of any other player in the game! We could literally see the impact of our actions on the other players of the game!
Sound familiar? Not only is it like the Scroll of Deeds, but it’s also pretty much like what we call a Life Review. The term was coined by Dr. Raymond Moody when he was studying NDE’s (or Near Death Experiences). He found by studying thousands of cases of people who were “clinically” dead but were resuscitated, that they all reported similar elements in their experience. One of the most common was a Life Review, where an angel (or being of light) played back scenes from this person’s life to them. One of the most famous of these was Dannion Brinkley, who wrote the bestseller Saved by the Light . Not only did Dannion remember this Life Review — he went out of his way to say it was a 360 degree Life Review — you got to see not only your actions, but the consequences of your actions from the point of view of other people!
The golden rule was enforced by quite literally forcing you to see the “game” played back from other player’s characters!
In fact, some kind of 3D screen capture, with some AI, may be the only way to accomplish what is described to us in the religious texts and is one of the key precepts of these religions!
Recording angels are more likely messengers of God in a literal sense that are tasked with watching what we do. How do we send messages today — through automated computer programs of course. In computer science, code that runs on its own as a separate process which monitors what we are doing are often referred to as Daemons, the Greek term for Demons. This may be more appropriate than the original namers realized — though perhaps they should be called Seraph, the Greek term for angels!
These aren’t the only things happening with God that are better handled by an AI than an all-powerful deity — think of billions of prayers coming into a central system — how would God, or Jehovah as he is called in the Old Testament, deal with this many prayers? An intelligent system of “angels” might be the only way to do this.
This initial analysis shows that the simulation hypothesis, the central theory which emerged from the release of the Matrix 20 years ago, may provide a scientific model for the things that prophets and religious texts have been telling us all along: that we are in a simulated world, like a video game, and that there are beings (or processes) outside of this world that are watching everything we do.
In Part 2, we will explore some of the ideas that underlie some of the Eastern religious traditions and show how the simulation hypothesis may provide the crucial model linking all of these traditions into modern science.

Mueller’s Chevauchée,www.therussophile.org,No Author,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/muellers-chevauchee.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Medieval English kings were not nice people. Edward III (1312–1377), in particular, used his son the Black Prince to wage a form of warfare called chevauch ée , which consisted of killing and burning everyone and everything that could be reached by fast-moving raiders.
The object was twofold. One was to destroy an opponent’s logistics base and discourage supporters. The other was to bait the opponent into leaving a good defensive position and coming out into the open, where he could be attacked; a noble needed strong nerves and a stony heart to stay behind walls while his subjects were slaughtered and his lands destroyed.
As many have noted during the past week, Robert Mueller and his legal sell-swords must have been aware for nigh onto two years, at least, that the accusation that Trump’s campaign colluded with the Russians had no evidentiary support. Nonetheless, per the attorney general’s summary letter to Congress , the investigation spent tens of millions of dollars, employed 19 lawyers and 40 other professional staff, issued 2,800 subpoenas, executed 500 search warrants, obtained more than 230 orders for communications records, authorized almost 50 pen registers, made 13 document requests to foreign governments, and interviewed 500 witnesses. Ship of Fools: How a S… Tucker Carlson Best Price: $2.33 Buy New $9.44 (as of 06:40 EDT – Details )
Barr and Mueller seem to regard this recounting as cause for satisfaction, as evidence of great diligence by the Department of Justice. But each of these actions inflicted substantial expense and career damage on those unlucky enough to be caught up in it. Every one of those witnesses should have lawyered up, knowing the ruthlessness of prosecutors on the scent of a big-time case. The game is to find something on a lower-level person and threaten him with heavy penalties unless he gives the prosecutor a more tempting target. If no extortionary material can be found, the witness can be accused of lying to the FBI, with the proof consisting of notes taken by the interviewing FBI agents themselves, since the agency refuses to make recordings. Family members can be threatened.
Most of these witnesses have kept quiet about the experience, content to have escaped. Some are speaking out, such as Michael Caputo , who has written eloquently and repeatedly about the costs imposed on him and others.
Sundance, at Conservative Treehouse , concludes that none of this investigating was really directed at the collusion charge. It was all an effort to entrap Trump himself or at least some of his supporters into actions that could be branded as “obstruction of justice,” with that term broadly interpreted to encompass almost any action he took.
When Trump said Michael Flynn was a “good guy,” this was spun as “obstruction.” When he wanted to release FISA memos, he was warned that this would be “obstruction.” Any reaching out to witnesses would have been branded “obstruction.” Any statement of sympathy for Paul Manafort or Roger Stone would have been obstruction gold."

2018 gave us the phrase “Creepy Porn Lawyer” thanks to Tucker Carlson.
2109 is giving us “Creepy ol’ Joe” Personally, I whenever I tweet about Joe Biden (D – Polanski) I just use #PedoJoe . I’ve been doing it for years now.
And, as such, I’m fascinated by the sudden outrage over Joe Biden’s predilection for groping girls in public. This has been discussed, posted, reposted and hashed out among people with any sense of decency for years.
Yes, folks, I’m taking the moral high ground on Creepy Joe Biden. It’s not a tall hill after all.
It made me sick last year while watching the otherwise really funny Parks and Recreation on Netflix to see Amy Poehler channel her sick fascination with Biden into creepy stalker comedy.
But it wasn’t funny.
Of course, as that show went on it became Poehler’s Mary Sue-like descent into DNC fan fiction rather than actual comedy. But, I digress.
Or do I.
Say it Ain’t So, #PedoJoe!?
Because it’s obvious that for a long time now the DNC and those behind it have been working overtime to normalize the dehumanization of children for predators like Biden.
As the backlash against Biden builds we’re seeing the regime mouthpieces try and deflect for him. Case in point the New York Times: You got it all backwards guys, he’s not groping and sniffing women, it’s “tactile politics” pic.twitter.com/um8bdS4Ne3

Tactile Politics? I wonder how much time the NYT editorial staff had to wrestle with their conscience before publishing this obvious bit of DNC spin.
Who am I kidding? These people don’t have consciences!
And neither do their opposition within the DNC itself.
The Snuffleupagus Affair
SnuffleGate is an obvious move by rival factions within the Democrats to kill Biden’s chances as the Gerry Cooney to Donald Trump in the 2020 election.
My bet is on Soros and the Justice Democrats. Because not only do we have this coming out we also have the sordid stuff pertaining to Biden’s son, Hunter, and Ukraine.
Again, this was all known for years in the corner of the Internet known as “Fake News.” It’s not really even appalling or outrageous that they would ignore such obvious corruption surrounding Biden for years until it could be deployed for maximum benefit.
We know that Justice Democrats is the plaything of Soros, Tom Steyer and others backing the dumbest man in political commentary, Cenk Uygur and is Not-So-Young Turks to promote hard-core ‘progressives’ (translation: actors posing as commies) to radicalize and vandalize what’s left of the Democratic process in this country.

I think a lot of Britons are wishing they’d read that before the 2017 general election now.
But when it comes to what’s happening here it’s obvious that Biden, the epitome of the safe, establishment old-white guy Democratic Party, was 1) easily vulnerable to this attack and 2) targeted for destruction.
Soror, Steyer and their ilk are vandals. They are using useful idiots like Cenk Uygur for their own ends which is the same sick psychodrama playing out in Europe right now over Brexit.
They are attacking both the democratic process here in the U.S. by funding hordes of immigrants in the hopes of gaming the electoral college on the one hand while sending literal morons like AOC and Ihlan Omar to Congress to distract everyone and send shock waves through the DNC establishment.
Biden Their Time
The Pelosi/Schumer (D – Boomers) wing of the Democratic party is failing. They had to back off on impeachment talk because they knew if they pursued Trump further they would be vulnerable to not only him winning in 2020 but to a ton of their people being ‘primaried’ out and losing control over the party itself.
I said this when Pelosi cut her deal with them to retain the Speaker’s gavel and put AOC on the finance committee.
That’s what rock-star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez represents. She is the face of what’s left of Occupy Wall St. And she has a strong, knee-jerk, anti-incumbent, anti-establishment momentum behind her.It doesn’t matter that she’s 28 years old, has little to no life experience or a firm grasp on reality. This is politics and these are chaotic times. She already has an acronym (AOC) and a nickname. She’s important.Warhorses like Pelosi don’t know how to change their ways this late in their game. They think they can buy off people like AOC and outmaneuver her.Pelosi faced a serious challenge to her party leadership in the run up to being elected Speaker of the House again. And she paid for that smooth vote with AOC’s appointment to the House Financial Services Committee.
Now Biden, the supposed front-runner, an old-baby boomer warhorse himself who could command some of the center of this country in a race against Trump, is history.
It’s really a shame I’ve sworn off popcorn."

Japan – A quiet geo-economic giant,www.therussophile.org,Kit Knightly,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/japan-a-quiet-geo-economic-giant.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Dr. Masahiro Matsumura
In the turbulent world politics involving extensive international coverage, stable and humdrum Japan does not have much of a presence. Yet, Japan is the world’s largest creditor nation while continuously playing significant roles in trade, direct investment and economic assistance. Japan in the background has reinforced itself as a leading geo-economic power while having almost thoroughly eliminated its huge non-performing loans in the banking sector and other structural vulnerabilities over the so-called “lost two decades” consequent on its bubble burst in the early 1990s.
Let us examine it by deploying the famous 5 Es of prof. Djawed Sangdel. Emphasizing Japan’s world-largest public debts that amount to nearly 240% of its GDP is misleading given that its public assets amount to nearly 200% and that the holding of the government bonds by the Bank of Japan, practically, a part of the government, amount to more than 80%. This is consistent with the good stability of a strong yen and very low long-term prime rates.
On the other hand, the U.S. faces deepening structural vulnerabilities in stocks that have resulted from the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the ensuing financial crisis, while experiencing a transitory booming in flows. Also, the E.U. remains mired not only in serious structural vulnerabilities but also in a persistent recession. Consequently, both the U.S. and the E.U. have a significantly less free hand in foreign economic policy, while keeping themselves busy to obtain or retain comparative gains through their strategic interaction, most notably in trade.
With the quantitative tightening of the U.S., the E.U., and, finally, the Japanese central banks, BRICS and other major developing economies encounter increasing difficulties in financing for investment and growth, compounded by the shrinking of their U.S. and European export outlets.
Particularly, the Chinese yuan is effectively pegged with the U.S. dollar, while China’s money supply in yuan is in fact based on its dollar reserves. Consequently, China is sliding into a serious recession, aggravated by the intense trade war with the U.S. No wonder that, last October, China made an abrupt about-face on its persistent anti-Japan policy, and concluded the currency swap agreement with Japan that would surely furnish China with 3 trillion Japanese yen (or less than 270 billion U.S. dollars) in the event of an acute liquidity crisis.
Looking closely at the recent Japan-China interaction, Japan’s quiet rise is more conspicuous. For several years prior to the official reconciliation of October 2018, the two countries appeared to geo-economically compete head-to-head, centered on aid and development according to China’s “One Belt One Road Strategy” and Japan’s counter-strategy, or “Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy”.
China is undergoing serious setbacks because many recipient/investee states have cancelled, cut down or postponed China-sponsored development projects. These states have suffered China’s “debt trap”, and many of the projects have turned out be financially, environmentally, and socially unsustainable. China is increasingly constrained to finance development projects due to the hardly discernible yet significant dwindling of its dollar reserves that is statistically covered up by its foreign borrowings.
Certainly, China has succeeded in luring more than ninety developing and developed countries with its huge fabricated foreign reserves as show money to participate in the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. But, the country has failed to secure the AIIB memberships of Japan and the United States, respectively the world’s largest credit nation and the key currency nation with most developed financial and bonds markets. Without sufficient funds and staffs, the AIIB cannot but co-finance projects with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to obtain a favorable credit rating necessary for financing though international financial markets.
In contrast, Japan has demanded China to observe international standards in aid and development, and only agreed in October 2018 to selectively coordinate its policy with China only when the country meets these stringent conditions. There has been no major successful coordination case between the two to date. Given that many of traditional Japanese aid recipients are no longer low-income countries, the Japanese approach will necessarily focus more on high quality aid and development in terms of sustainability through the public-private sector cooperation. The approach will be superior to China’s, at least over a medium to long run.
Additionally, Japan plays a leading role to preserve the existing free and open international economic system. Against the tide of populism and protectionism, most notably U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First”, Japan successfully led the formation of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership after the U.S. made an abrupt exit from an early TPP in the making, and concluded the Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement.
In nutshell, Japan’s geo-economic power and influence will be outstanding, at least for a mid-term. Yet, the country is not free from serious risks and problems. For a short term, Japan’s rise will remain quiet and, perhaps, unnoticeable, especially because its geo-economic power and influence may be reduced by geo-political risks and crises, and because its vested bureaucratic interests hamper consolidation of its huge public debts and assets, which involves the great risk of a liquidity crisis. For a long term, Japan needs to find out a societal equation to cope with an unprecedented low birthrate and a high longevity rate. The world must stay tuned on humdrum Japan.

South Asia’s Nuclear-Armed Neighbors Pull Back From the Abyss – Barely
By Dilip Hiro
It’s still the most dangerous border on Earth. Yet compared to the recent tweets of President Donald Trump, it remains a marginal news story. That doesn’t for a moment diminish the chance that the globe’s first (and possibly ultimate) nuclear conflagration could break out along that 480-mile border known as the Line of Control (and, given the history that surrounds it, that phrase should indeed be capitalized). The casus belli would undoubtedly be the more than seven-decades-old clash between India and Pakistan over the contested territory of Kashmir. Like a volcano, this unresolved dispute rumbles periodically – as it did only weeks ago – threatening to spew its white-hot lava to devastating effect not just in the region but potentially globally as well.
The trigger for renewed rumbling is always a sensational terrorist attack by a Pakistani militant group on an Indian target. That propels the India’s leadership to a moral high ground. From there, bitter condemnations of Pakistan are coupled with the promise of airstrikes on the training camps of the culprit terrorist organizations operating from the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir. As a result, the already simmering relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbors are quickly raised to a boiling point. This, in turn, prompts the United States to intervene and pressure Pakistan to shut down those violent jihadist groups. To placate Washington, the Pakistani government goes through the ritual of issuing banning orders on those groups, but in practice, any change is minimal.
And in the background always lurks the possibility that a war between the two neighbors could lead to a devastating nuclear exchange. Which means that it’s time to examine how and why, by arraying hundreds of thousands of troops along that Line of Control, India and Pakistan have created the most perilous place on Earth.
How It All Began
The Kashmir dispute began with the birth of the kicking twins – Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan – as independent countries. They emerged from the belly of the dying British Raj in August 1947. The princely states in British India were given the option of joining either of the new nations. The dithering Hindu ruler of Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir (its full title) finally signed a legally binding instrument of accession with New Delhi after his realm was invaded by armed tribal raiders from Pakistan. This document offered that state’s citizens the chance to choose between the two countries once peace had been restored. This has not happened so far and there is no credible prospect that it will.
After the 1947-1948 Indo-Pakistani War that followed independence, India was left in control of almost two-thirds of the princely state (18% of which it lost to China in the Sino-Indian War of 1962). Crucially, the 45% of the former princely state that remained in its hands included the Vale of Kashmir. Guarded by snow-capped mountain peaks, covered with verdant forests of fir and pine, carpeted by wild flowers in the spring, and irrigated by the Jhelum River, it has been described by poets and others as “paradise on Earth.” Its population of seven million is 96% Muslim. And it is this territory that is coveted by Pakistan.
In 1989, having secured the withdrawal of the Soviet army from Afghanistan after a 10-year struggle, some of the Afghan Mujahedin (“Holy Warriors”), including Pakistani militants, turned their attention to liberating Indian-controlled Kashmir. In this, they had the active backing of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, or ISI, of Pakistan’s army. Earlier, the ISI had acted as the conduit for channeling U.S. and Saudi-supplied weapons and cash to the Mujahedin coalition.
At that time, the two Pakistani groups in the Mujahedin coalition, which always harbored an anti-Indian agenda, emerged front and center. They were the Jaish-e Mohammad (Army of Mohammad) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (Army of the Righteous), led respectively by Masoud Azhar and Hafiz Saeed. Working with those Kashmiris who wanted their state to secede from India, they soon began to resort to terrorist acts.
The Indian government responded with draconian measures. In July 1990, it passed the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, or AFJKSP, a law that authorized the state government to declare any part of Jammu and Kashmir a “disturbed area,” where the Indian army would be free to shoot anyone acting in contravention of “any law” or in possession of a deadly weapon. Indian forces could now arrest people suspected of committing any offense without a warrant or enter and search any premises to make such arrests. In other words, from then on, the armed forces had carte blanche legal immunity to do whatever they wished without the slightest accountability.
Yet resistance to Indian rule did not subside. In fact, the slogan “ Azadi ” (Freedom) caught on, emboldening both terror groups to jointly launch an audacious attack on the Indian Parliament building on December 20, 2001, with the aim of taking lawmakers hostage. (They were bravely blocked by armed guards.) In the crisis that followed, the mobilized armies of the two neighbors, each already a declared nuclear power, faced off across their international border and the Line of Control in Kashmir. Pressured by Washington, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf banned the two terror organizations in January 2002. Yet both of them soon resurfaced under different names.
In June 2002, at a regional conference in the Kazakh city of Almaty, Musharraf assailed then-Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for ignoring the wishes of the Kashmiri people. “The possession of nuclear weapons by any state obviously implies they will be used under some circumstances,” he stated grimly, refusing to commit his country (as India had) to a “no first use” policy on nuclear arms. Vajpayee accused him of “nuclear blackmail.” At home, however, Musharraf’s hardline stance was applauded by the militant groups.
Over the years, the crisis only deepened. In November 2008, for instance, working with the ISI, the operatives of Lashkar-e-Taiba attacked Mumbai’s landmark Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and two other inns. After a 60-hour siege , 166 people, including 28 foreigners, were dead. Despite initial denials, Pakistan would finally acknowledge that the Mumbai conspiracy was, in part, hatched on its soil, and place Lashkar-e-Taiba leader Saeed under house arrest. But no charges would be leveled against him and he would, in the end, be released.
After the Mumbai carnage, Jaish-e Mohammad’s chief, Azhar, kept a low profile for several years, only to reappear publicly in 2014, issuing fiery calls for more attacks on India (and the United States as well). In September 2016, his fighters stormed an army camp in Uri, an Indian garrison town near the Line of Control, killing 19 soldiers.
With the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, under Narendra Modi gaining power in New Delhi in 2014, repression of the Muslim separatist movement in Kashmir only intensified. Within three years, the number of security personnel – army troops, paramilitaries, border guards, federal armed policemen, state policemen, and intelligence agents – had reached 470,000 in Jammu and Kashmir, which had a population of only 14.1 million . As a result, the proportion of local Kashmiris among anti-Indian fighters only rose .
A Sensational Terrorist Attack
This February 14th, a 19-year-old suicide bomber, Adil Ahmad Dar, drove a car bomb into an Indian convoy heading for Kashmir’s capital city, Srinagar. At least 40 Indian paramilitary troops were killed – the worst such attack in the troubled history of the state. Jaish-e Mohammad proudly claimed responsibility.
After dropping out of his village school, Dar had gone to work in a neighbor’s sawmill. During a four-month-long protest sparked by the killing of a popular 22-year-old local militant leader, Burhan Wani, in July 2016, Indian troops gunned down nearly 100 protestors, while injuring 15,000, including Dar. In response, he crossed the Line of Control and joined Jaish-e Mohammad. In the wake of his suicide attack, Indian soldiers raided the home of his parents, locked them inside, and set it on fire. And so it continues in the officially “disturbed” Kashmir.
In response to the deaths of the soldiers (and keenly aware of an upcoming nationwide election), Prime Minister Modi exploited the situation for political ends. He turned popular grief into an emotive and prolonged commemoration of those military deaths. TV networks focused on the flag-draped coffins of the slain troops, while local BJP candidates followed their hearses. The cremations were telecast live, while Modi proclaimed that “the security forces have been given complete freedom. The blood of the people is boiling.”
On February 26th, temporarily released from civilian control, the Indian military launched a “pre-emptive” air strike on an alleged Jaish-e Mohammad training camp near Balakot, six miles inside Pakistan’s Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. The last time the air forces of either country had crossed the international border was during their 1971 war.
India claimed to have killed more than 300 militants, but Islamabad reported that the Indian bombs had actually hit a totally deserted site. (This would be confirmed later by satellite analysis from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute which concluded that no damage had been done to the hilltop facility India claimed to have struck.) The next day Pakistan announced that, in a dogfight between warplanes of the two countries, an Indian fighter jet had been shot down and its pilot, Abhinandan Varthaman, captured.
India angrily demanded that he be set free immediately. On February 28th, while announcing the pilot’s release during a televised address, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan warned against miscalculation and the explosive potential for such aerial skirmishes to escalate into a wider conflict in the most dangerous environment on the planet. He said , “With the weapons you have and the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation? Shouldn’t we think that, if this escalates, what will it lead to?”
This was a barely disguised reference to the devastating nuclear arsenals that the two South Asian neighbors now possess , with 135 nukes in New Delhi’s possession and 145 in Islamabad’s. Those arsenals are more than capable of causing havoc far beyond South Asia. It’s estimated that even a “moderate” Indo-Pakistani nuclear conflict could create a global “nuclear winter,” killing directly or indirectly up to a billion people as crops failed and starvation stalked the Earth.
Those Nuclear Arsenals
Pakistan’s arsenal now includes tactical nuclear weapons (TNWs) with “low” explosive power for battlefield use. In 2011, it tested its first one successfully. Since then, according to Professor Rajesh Rajagopalan, author of Nuclear South Asia: Keywords and Concepts , Pakistan is believed to have assembled four or five of these annually. They are to be fired from the Nasr, a short-range missile. Two successful tests of it were conducted this January.
Islamabad began producing and deploying TNWs after India adopted a “Cold Start” military contingency plan to punish unacceptable Pakistani provocations like mass-casualty terror strikes. After repeated denials, in early 2017, India’s army chief finally acknowledged the existence of the plan, involving the creation of eight division-size integrated battle groups (IBGs). Each is to consist of infantry, artillery, armor, and air support and is to be able to operate independently on the battlefield. In response to major terrorist attacks from Pakistan or by Pakistani-based groups, the IBGs are to rapidly penetrate that country at unexpected locations and advance up to 30 miles beyond the border, disrupting command-and-control networks while trying to avoid locations likely to trigger nuclear retaliation. In other words, the goal is to be able to launch an overwhelming conventional strike swiftly but in a limited fashion in order to ward off a Pakistani nuclear response. Overall, India’s contingency plan assumes unrealistically that, in the heat of the battle, leaders on both sides will remain calm and rational.
Responding to Islamabad’s production of theater nuclear weapons, New Delhi initiated a super-secret nuclear program revealed only in December 2015, thanks to an investigation by the Washington-based Center for Public Integrity. A top-secret, government-run, $100 million rare materials plant near the city of Mysore in southern India now houses a nuclear enrichment complex that has been operating since 2012. It feeds the country’s nuclear weapons program and, far more ominously, has laid the foundation for an ambitious Indian hydrogen bomb project.
To consternation in world capitals, it was also revealed that this plant has a larger twin 160 miles north of Mysore in southern India that goes by the innocuous name of the Aeronautical Test Range . Conceived in March 2007 by the defense ministry, its construction started in 2012 on nearly 13 square miles of land. It is to become the subcontinent’s largest military-run complex of nuclear centrifuges, atomic-research laboratories, and weapons- and aircraft-testing facilities after its completion in 2020. Among the project’s aims is to expand the government’s nuclear research, to produce fuel for the country’s nuclear reactors, and to help power its fleet of new nuclear submarines. This nuclear city is to be protected by a ring of military garrisons, turning the site into a virtual military facility, which also means that it will not be open to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Its overarching aim is to give the country an extra stockpile of enriched uranium fuel that could be used to create hydrogen bombs and so further enhance the power of India’s already devastating nuclear arsenal.
Both of these projects are directed by the office of the prime minister. India’s Atomic Energy Act and its Official Secrets Act have placed everything linked to the country’s nuclear program under wraps. In the past, those who tried to find out more about these activities were bludgeoned into silence.
According to Gary Samore, an Obama-era White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction, “India intends to build thermonuclear weapons as part of its strategic deterrent against China. It is unclear when India will realize this goal of a larger and more powerful arsenal, but they will.” Once manufactured, however, nothing would block India from deploying them against Pakistan. “India is now developing very big bombs, hydrogen bombs that are city-busters,” commented Pakistani nuclear physicist Pervez Hoodbhoy. “It is not interested in [producing] nuclear weapons for use on the battlefield; it is developing nuclear weapons for eliminating population centers.”
In other words, while India has long been in a nuclear arms race with Pakistan, it is no longer sticking to the same race course. In late March, Modi announced that India recently launched a rocket successfully shooting down one of its satellites. This creates the possibility that, in a future nuclear war with Pakistan, it could preemptively “blind” the Pakistanis by destroying their space-based communication and surveillance satellites. A race of another kind could be in the offing.
The central motive that drove Pakistan to develop its nuclear arsenal, however, remains unchanged. It was the only way Islamabad could deter New Delhi from defeating it in a war waged with conventional weapons. India’s 2.14 million-strong military , equipped with 5,967 artillery pieces, 4,500 tanks, and 2,216 aircraft, is significantly larger and better armed than Pakistan’s 1.55 million soldiers, 3,745 artillery, 2,700 tanks, and 1,143 aircraft. In addition, New Delhi’s annual defense budget of $55.9 billion is more than five times Islamabad’s $10.8 billion.
Little wonder that, in his February 28th televised address, while announcing the Indian pilot’s release, Prime Minister Khan suggested that the two sides “should sit down and resolve our problems through dialogue.” He claimed that his own political party, Pakistan Tahreek-e-Insaf (the Pakistan Movement for Justice), and the country’s powerful military were “all on one page” in wishing to mend fences with India.
Pakistan’s Belated Suppression of Violent Jihadists
In late February, India handed over to Pakistan a dossier with information on Jaish-e Mohammad, its top leadership, and their involvement in several terror attacks. Islamabad initially said that the dossier was being “examined.” However, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi added that his government could act against Masoud Azhar only if New Delhi provided “solid, inalienable evidence” strong enough to convince the country’s judiciary.
And yet on March 8th, the Pakistani government acted, launching a crackdown on leading terrorist groups. Among other things, it outlawed the Jamaat-ud Dawa (Society of the Islamic Call), or JuD, a welfare organization that raised funds for Lashkar-e-Taiba. It sealed the banned organization’s headquarters in Lahore as well as more than 200 schools, seminaries, and hospitals it ran. It also banned its chief, Hafiz Saeed, from leading Friday prayers on the sprawling JuD complex and kept him under surveillance.
One key factor that spurred such action was a warning the Pakistani government received on February 22nd from the Paris-based intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF). It threatened to add Pakistan to its blacklist of non-cooperating countries if, by May, it failed to take specific steps against the financing of terrorism. To be added to the FATF blacklist could mean being sanctioned by most Western nations, a development only likely to deepen Islamabad’s current financial crisis. (Recently, it has had barely enough foreign reserves to pay for two months of imports or service a huge loan it secured from the International Monetary Fund in 2013.)
In January 2018, President Donald Trump had already cancelled plans for Washington to give Pakistan $1.3 billion in military aid and had imposed sanctions on the country for its support of terrorist groups, including the Afghan Taliban. On Twitter, he accused Pakistan of “providing nothing but lies and deceit.” Soon after, the FATF placed Pakistan on its “gray list.”
Still, none of that proved sufficient to compel Pakistan’s powerful military high command to cede its traditional monopoly on national security and foreign policy decision-making, including its covert backing of anti-Indian extremist groups through the ISI. Only when pressure continued to build, bolstered by fresh urging from Washington, London, and Paris, was a critical mass reached that made those generals finally fall in line with recently elected Prime Minister Khan’s more conciliatory stance toward India.
Now, the international community can only hope that the carnage and chaos of February was the last in a tragic series of encounters between nuclear neighbors that could otherwise lead South Asia to devastation and the world to nuclear winter.

‘We’re all puppets,’ the suspect [Sirhan Sirhan] replied, with more truth than he could have understood at that moment.—Lisa Pease, quoting from the LAPD questioning of Sirhan
When Senator Robert Kennedy was assassinated on June 5, 1968, the American public fell into a hypnotic trance in which they have remained ever since. The overwhelming majority accepted what was presented by government authorities as an open and shut case that a young Palestinian American, Sirhan Sirhan, had murdered RFK because of his support for Israel, a false accusation whose ramifications echo down the years. That this was patently untrue and was contradicted by overwhelming evidence made no difference.
Sirhan did not kill Robert Kennedy, yet he remains in jail to this very day. Robert Kennedy, Jr., who was 14 years old at the time of his father’s death, has visited Sirhan in prison, claims he is innocent, and believes there was another gunman. Paul Schrade, an aide to the senator and the first person shot that night, also says Sirhan didn’t do it. Both have plenty of evidence. And they are not alone.
There is a vast body of documented evidence to prove this, an indisputably logical case marshalled by serious writers and researchers. Lisa Pease is the latest. It is a reason why a group of 60 prominent Americans has recently called for a reopening of, not just this case, but those of JFK, MLK, and Malcom X. The blood of these men cries out for the revelation of the truth that the United States national security state and its media accomplices have fought so mightily to keep hidden for so many years.
That they have worked so hard at this reveals how dangerous the truth about these assassinations still is to this secret government that wages propaganda war against the American people and real wars around the world. It is a government of Democrats, Republicans, and their intelligence allies working together today to confuse the American people and provoke Russia in a most dangerous game that could lead to nuclear war, a possibility that so frightened JFK and RFK after the Cuban Missile Crisis that they devoted themselves to ending the Cold War, reconciling with the Soviet Union, abolishing nuclear weapons, reining in of the power of the CIA, and withdrawing from Vietnam. That is why they were killed.
The web of deceit surrounding the now officially debunked Democratic led Russia-gate propaganda operation that has strengthened Trump to double-down on his anti-Russia operations (a Democratic goal) is an example of the perfidious and sophisticated mutuality of this game of mass mind-control.
The killing of the Kennedys and today’s new Cold War and war against terror are two ends of a linked intelligence operation.
Moreover, more than any other assassination of the 1960s, it is the killing of Bobby Kennedy that has remained shrouded in the most ignorance.
It is one of the greatest propaganda success stories of American history.
In her exhaustive new examination of the case, A Lie Too Big To Fail , Lisa Pease puts it succinctly at the conclusion of her unravelling of the official lies that have mesmerized the public: “The assassination of the top four leaders of the political left in the five year period—President John Kennedy in 1963, Malcolm X in 1965, and Martin Luther King, Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy in 1968—represented nothing less than a slow-motion coup on the political scene.”
If anyone wishes to understand what has happened to the United States since this coup, and thus to its countless victims at home and throughout the world, one must understand these assassinations and how the alleged assassins were manipulated by the coup organizers and how the public was hoodwinked in a mind-control operation on a vast scale. It is not ancient history, for the forces that killed these leaders rule the U.S. today, and their ruthlessness has subsequently informed the actions of almost all political leaders in the years since. A bullet to the head when you seriously talk about peace and justice is a not so gentle reminder to toe the line or else.
“But the way the CIA took over America in the 1960s is the story of our time,” writes Pease, “and too few recognize this. We can’t fix a problem we can’t even acknowledge exists.”Nothing could be truer.
Lisa Pease has long recognized the problem, and for the past twenty-five years, she has devoted herself to shedding light on the CIA’s culpability, particularly in the Robert Kennedy case. Few people possess the grit and grace to spend so much of their lives walking this path of truth. The extent of her research is dazzling, so dazzling in its voluminous detail that a reviewer can only touch on it here and there. She has written a book that is daunting in its comprehensiveness. It demands focused attention and perseverance, for it runs to over 500 pages with more than 800 footnotes. This book will remain a touchstone for future research on the RFK assassination, whether one agrees or disagrees with all of her detailed findings and speculations. For this book is so vast and meticulous in its examination of all aspects of the case that one can surely find areas that one might question or disagree with.
Nevertheless, Pease fundamentally proves that Sirhan did not shoot RFK and that there was a conspiracy organized and carried out by shadowy intelligence forces that did so. These same forces worked with the Los Angeles Police Department, federal, state, and judicial elements to make sure Sirhan was quickly accused of being the lone assassin and dispatched to prison after a show trial. And the mass media carried out its assigned role of affirming the government’s case to shield the real killers and to make sure the cover-up was successful.
No doubt others will investigate this case further. Yet I think no more research is really needed, for as with these other assassinations, additional analyses will only result in pseudo-debates about minutiae. Such debates will only serve to prolong the hallucinatory grip the perpetrators of these crimes have on a day of reckoning, suggesting as they would that we do not really know what happened. This is an old tactic meant to delay forevermore such a day of reckoning.
The facts are clear for all to see if they have the will to truth. All that is now needed is a public tribunal, which is planned for later this year, in which the fundamental, clear-cut facts of these cases are presented to the American public. In the case of Robert Kennedy’s assassination as with the others, a little knowledge goes a long way, and only those who are closed to basic logic and evidence will refuse to see that government forces conspired to kill these men and did so because all were seeking peace and justice that was then, and is now, a threat to the war-making forces of wealth and power that control the American government.
Pease writes: “Anyone who has looked closely and honestly at the evidence has realized that more than one person was involved in Robert Kennedy’s death. So why can’t reporters see this? Why can’t the media explain this? Because the media and the government are two sides of the same coin, and those who challenge the government’s version of history, as numerous reporters have found out, all too often lose status and sometimes whole careers. Kristina Borjesson published an anthology of such stories in her book Into the Buzzsaw, in which journalists describe how they lost their careers when each of them expressed a truth that the government did not want exposed.”
Lisa Pease discloses such truths. I am reporting on her work. Therefore, the mainstream media, except for an extraordinary reporter or two, such as Tom Jackman of The Washington Post , will likely ignore both of us, but the publication where you are reading this is on the side of truth, and in the disclosure of truth lies our hope.
Since more than one person was involved in the killing of RFK, there was—ipso facto—a conspiracy. This is not theory but fact. The fact of a conspiracy. For more than fifty years, mainstream reporters have been cowed by this word “conspiracy,” thanks to the CIA. Many others have been intelligence assets posing as journalists, regurgitating the lies. This is a fact.
The official story is that after giving his victory speech for winning the 1968 Democratic California Primary, Kennedy, as he was walking through a crowded hotel pantry, was shot by Sirhan Sirhan, who was standing to his left between 3-6 feet away. Sirhan’s revolver held eight bullets, and as he was shooting, he was tackled by a group of large men who subdued him. All witnesses place Sirhan in front of Kennedy and all claim he was firing a gun.
Fact: As the autopsy definitively showed, RFK was shot from the rear at point blank range, three bullets entering his body, with the fatal head shot coming upward at a 45-degree angle from 1-3 inches behind his right ear. Not one bullet from Sirhan’s gun hit the Senator. In addition, an audio recording shows that many more bullets than the eight in Sirhan’s gun were fired in the hotel pantry that night. It was impossible for Sirhan to have killed RFK.
Let me repeat: More than one gunman, contrary to the government’s claims, equals a conspiracy. So why lie about that?
What is amazing is that the obvious conclusion to such simple syllogistic logic (Sirhan in front, bullets in the back, therefore…) that a child could understand has been dismissed by the authorities for fifty-one years. The fact that the government authorities—the LAPD, the Sheriff’s Office, the District Attorney, federal and state government officials, the FBI, the CIA—have from the start so assiduously done all in their power to pin the blame on “a lone assassin,” Sirhan, proves they are part of a coordinated cover-up, which in turn suggests their involvement in the crime.
The fact that Robert Kennedy was shot from the back and not the front where Sirhan was standing immediately brings to mind the Zapruder film that shows that JFK was killed from the front right and not from the 6th floor rear where Oswald was allegedly shooting from. That unexpected film evidence was hidden from the public for many years, but when it was finally seen, the case for a government conspiracy was solidified.
While no such video evidence has surfaced in the RFK case, the LAPD made sure that no photographic evidence contradicting the official lies would be seen. As Lisa Pease writes: “Less than two months after the assassination, the LAPD took the extraordinary step of burning some 2,400 photos from the case in Los Angeles County General’s medical waste incinerator. Why destroy thousands of photos in an incinerator if there was nothing to hide? The LAPD kept hundreds of innocuous crowd scene photos that showed no girl in a polka dot dress or no suspicious activities or individuals. Why were those photos preserved? Perhaps because those photos had nothing in them that warranted their destruction.”
While “perhaps” is a mild word, the cover-up of “the girl in the polka dot dress” needs no perhaps. Dozens of people reported seeing a suspicious, curvaceous girl in a white dress with black polka dots with Sirhan in the pantry and other places. She was seen with various other men as well. The evidence for her involvement in the assassination is overwhelming, and yet the LAPD did all in its power to deny this by browbeating witnesses and by allowing her to escape.
Sandra Serrano, a Kennedy campaign worker and a courageous witness, was bullied by the CIA-connected police interrogator Sergeant Enrique “Hank” Hernandez. She had been sitting outside on a metal fire escape getting some air when the polka dot dress girl, accompanied by a man, ran out and down the stairs, shouting, “We’ve shot him, we’ve shot him. ”When Serrano asked whom did they shoot, the girl replied, “We’ve shot Senator Kennedy. ”Then she and her companion, both of whom Serrano had earlier seen ascending the stairs with Sirhan, disappeared into the night. A little over an hour after the shooting Serrano was interviewed on live television by NBC’s Sander Vanocur where she recounted this. And there were others who saw and heard this girl say the same thing as she and her companion fled the crime scene. Nevertheless, the LAPD, led by Lieutenant Manuel Pena, also CIA affiliated, who was brought out of retirement to run the investigation dubbed “Special Unit Senator,” worked with Hernandez and others to dismiss the girl as of no consequence.
Lisa Pease covers all this and much more. She shows how Sirhan was obviously hypnotized, how the trial was a farce, how the police destroyed evidence from the door frames in the pantry that proved more than the eight bullets in Sirhan’s gun were fired, how Officer DeWayne Wolfer manipulated the ballistic evidence, etc. Through years of digging into court records, archives, transcripts, the public library, and doing countless interviews, she proves without a doubt that Sirhan did not kill Kennedy and that the assassination and the cover-up were part of a very sophisticated intelligence operation involving many parts and players. She shows how no matter what route Kennedy took in the hotel that night, the killers had all exits covered and that he would not be allowed to leave alive.
While some of her more speculative points—e.g. that Robert Maheu (Howard Hughes/CIA) was “the most credible high-level suspect for the planner of Robert Kennedy’s assassination,” that Kennedy was shot twice in the head from behind, etc., are open to debate, they do not detract from her fundamentally powerful case that RFK, like his brother John, was assassinated by a CIA-run operation intended to silence their voices of courageous resistance to an expanding secret government dedicated to war, murder, and human exploitation. The U.S. government of today.
When Bobby Kennedy was entering the kitchen pantry, he was escorted by a security guard named Thane Eugene Cesar, a man long suspected of being the assassin. Cesar was carrying a gun that he drew but denied firing, despite witnesses’ claims to the contrary. Conveniently, the police never examined the gun. He has long been suspected of being CIA affiliated, and now Pease says she has found evidence to confirm that. She writes, “It’s hard to overstate the significance of finding a current or future CIA contract agent holding Kennedy’s right arm at the moment of the shooting.”
Yes, it is. As she rightly claims, the CIA takeover of America in the 1960s is the story of our time. And our time is now. None of this is ancient history. That is so crucial to grasp. For those who think that learning the truth about the 1960s assassinations is an exercise in futility reserved for those who are living in the past, they need to think again. Our descent into endless war and massive media propaganda to support it is part of a long-term project that began with the elimination of JFK, Malcom X, MLK, and Robert Kennedy. They were killed for reasons, and those reasons still exist, even if they don’t physically, but only in spirit. Their killers roam the land because they have become far more deeply part of the institutional structure of government and the media.
Pease says: “It was horrible that Robert Kennedy was taken from us far too soon. It is horrible that one man has borne the guilt for an operation he neither planned nor willingly participated in. It’s horrible the conspiracy was so obvious that bullets had to be lost and switched to hide it. And it’s horrible that the mainstream media has never dared to tell the people of this country that the government lied to us about what they really found when they looked into this case. Until the media can deal with the truth of the Robert Kennedy assassination, and until the people can be made aware of the CIA’s role in slanting the truth on topics of great importance, America’s very survival is in jeopardy….We’ve come perilously close to losing democracy itself because of fake, CIA-sponsored stories about our history. Should America ever become a dictatorship, the epitaph of our democracy must include the role the mainstream media, by bowing to the National Security state, played in killing it.”
By writing A Lie Too Big To Fail, Lisa Pease has done her valiant part in refuting the lie that is now failing. Now it is up to all of us to spread the word of truth by focusing on the fundamental facts so we can finally take back our country from the CIA.
Then we can say with RFK and his favorite poet Aeschylus: “And even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.”

Trump-Barr’s manipulation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report: The political cover-up of the century?,www.therussophile.org,Dr. Rodrigue Tremblay,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/trump-barrs-manipulation-of-special-counsel-robert-muellers-report-the-political-cover-up-of-the-century.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
“ In the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.
“It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously…“—Adolf Hitler (1889-1945), (in ‘Mein Kampf’, 1925, vol. I, ch. 10)
“If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.”—Joseph Goebbels (1897-1945), (as quoted in Thinkexist.com)
“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government, which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. “—Edward Louis Bernays (1891-1995), (in ‘Propaganda’, 1928, ch. 1)
“In politics, stupidity is not a handicap!”—Napoleon Bonapar te (1769-1821), (as quoted by parismarais.fr )
We live in a very corrupt era. A case in point is the current and scandalous manipulation of the Mueller report by the Trump administration, with hardly any outcry from people in authority. Indeed, of the close to 400 pages (excluding tables and appendices) of the Mueller report delivered to the U.S. Attorney General on Friday March 22, 2019, not a single page has yet to be made public either to the elected Congress and/or to the American people to see for themselves the real content of the full report.
The only thing made public, so far, is a four-page memo written by Attorney General William Barr, a recent appointee of Donald Trump, which says nice things about his boss and contains a vague promise to release a heavily censored version of the Mueller report sometime in the future (see below). To take at face value what a Trump’s appointee says, especially a lawyer, could be a big mistake.
This is an administration known for its serial lies. It has no respect for the truth whatsoever. It has only partisan interests. In fact, Donald Trump is a believer in the “Big Lie” political theory, a propaganda technique first advanced by Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) in his 1925 book Mein Kampf . According to this theory, the bigger a politician’s lies and the more out of the ordinary, the more part of the population will be ready to believe them.
Donald Trump was at it again on Thursday, March 28, when he wrongly claimed in a speech in Grand Rapids, Michigan, that the Mueller report “ fully exonerated him ” of any wrong doing. This is curious since no part of the report has yet been made public and Barr’s own opinion and brief interpretation were only that “ Mueller had reached no conclusion about whether Trump had obstructed justice ”! This is an example of stretching the truth, if I’ve ever seen one. Trump’s political career has been a long series of lies, falsehoods, untruths, exaggerations and misrepresentations, and there is no reason to think that the future would be different from the past.
But, there is something fishy here. If the 400-page report by the Department of Justice’s special counsel, Robert Mueller, (about Donald Trump cheating and obstructing justice in his relations with Russia) really does contain positive conclusions about the current occupant of the White House, his family and associates, don’t you think the tandem Trump-Barr would have rushed to make it public? At the very least, wouldn’t they have delivered copies of the full report to Congress? Why are they willing to fight to keep it secret from the elected Congress? The only logical answer is that the complete Mueller report contains very damaging material about Trump, his family and his administration, and William Barr does not want Americans to see it.
In any case, even if some media have jumped onboard Mr. Barr’s presentation of the contents of the report, a net majority of Americans are not falling for the Trump-Barr sleight of hand trick of hiding the report. Nor do they accept their game of hide and seek, claiming that the report contains conclusions favorable to them, but keeping those conclusions secret. A NPR/PBS NewsHour/Maris poll , for example, indicated that only Trump’s gullible political base, just 36 percent, believe the Trump-Barr manipulation of the report, i.e., that Donald Trump has been “cleared” from wrongdoing. What is more, 56 percent believe the contrary, and 75 percent want the full report, uncensored, unredacted, unedited and with no blackouts, to be made public ASAP.
Attorney General Barr has lately pulled a rabbit, or maybe a red herring, out of his hat to stall things further, in an obvious attempt to ‘drown the fish’ and take the sting out of the Mueller report. Indeed, on Friday, March 29, Mr. Barr wrote a letter to the chairmen of the relevant committees of both the House and the Senate offering to rewrite the Mueller report on his own in order to exclude some so-called “sensitive” sections, some of which no doubt referring to his boss and his immediate family working in the White House. It is doubtful that such censorship is really necessary because it is most likely that special counsel Mueller and his team, knowing full well that their report will be made public, have been very careful not to include any sensitive or classified intelligence or any other touchy legal information. This could be the political cover-up of the century.
Indeed, the attorney general now wants to make public his own censored version of the Mueller report by excluding four broad categories of information from the official report: Grand jury material; Information that could compromise sensitive intelligence sources or methods; Details related to ongoing investigations; and Information that would unduly infringe on ‘the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties’.
This is an obvious attempt to gut the entire report.
In conclusion, it appears that the Trump administration is very busy making sure that anything in the Mueller report found damaging to the president, his immediate family and associates will be purged from the censored version, to be released in a few weeks. I doubt very much that the Democratic leadership in Congress will acquiesce to such blatant censorship of a report about political figures and originally designed to be made public in its entirety.
Mr. Adam Schiff’s indictments of Republicans
Considering this development, it may be useful to recall House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff ’s admonitions to his Republican colleagues, on Thursday, March 28, about their lack of probity and honesty and their “immoral,”“unethical,”“unpatriotic,” and “corrupt” behavior:
“You [the Republicans] might think that it is okay: That the Russians offered dirt on the Democratic candidate for president as part of what’s described as the Russian government’s effort to help the Trump campaign. You might think that’s okay. That when that was offered to the son of the president (Donald Trump Jr.), who had a pivotal role in the campaign, that the president’s son did not call the FBI, and that he did not adamantly refuse that foreign help — no, instead that son said he would ‘love’ the help of the Russians. You might think it was okay that he took that meeting? That Paul Manafort, the campaign chair, someone with great experience running campaigns, also took that meeting. You might think it’s okay that the president’s son-in-law (Jared Kushner) also took that meeting. You might think it’s okay that they concealed it from the public. You might think it’s okay that their only disappointment after that meeting was that the dirt they received on Hillary Clinton wasn’t better. You might think it’s okay. — I don’t. That, when it was discovered a year later that they had lied about that meeting and said it was about adoptions, you might think it’s okay that the president is reported to have helped dictate that lie. You might think it’s okay. — I don’t. That the campaign chairman of a presidential campaign would offer information about that campaign to a Russian oligarch in exchange for money or debt forgiveness. You might think that’s okay. — I don’t. That [Donald Trump’s] campaign chairman offered polling data, campaign polling data, to someone linked to Russian intelligence. — I don’t think that’s okay. That the president himself called on Russia to hack his opponent’s emails, if they were listening. You might think it’s okay that, later that day, the Russians in fact attempted to hack a server affiliated with that campaign. — I don’t think that’s okay. That the president’s son-in-law (Jared Kushner) sought to establish a secret back-channel of communication with Russians through a Russian diplomatic facility. — I don’t think that’s okay. That an associate of the president (Roger Stone) made direct contact with the GRU (the Military intelligence service of Russia) through Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks, that is considered a hostile intelligence agency. You might think it’s okay that a senior campaign official was instructed to reach that associate and find out what that hostile intelligence agency had to say, in terms of dirt on his opponent. That the national security adviser-designate (Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn) secretly conferred with a Russian ambassador about undermining U.S. sanctions, and you might think it’s okay he lied about it to the FBI. You might say that’s all okay. You might say that’s just what you need to do to win. — But I don’t think it’s okay. I think it’s immoral, I think it’s unethical, I think it’s unpatriotic and, yes, I think it’s corrupt, and it is an evidence of collusion… [Moreover], I don’t think it’s OK that during a presidential campaign Mr. Trump sought the Kremlin’s help to consummate a real estate deal in Moscow that would make him a fortune — according to the special counsel, hundreds of millions of dollars. I don’t think it’s OK to conceal it from the public. I don’t think it’s OK that he advocated a new and more favorable policy towards the Russians even as he was seeking the Russians’ help, the Kremlin’s help to make money. I don’t think it’s OK that his attorney lied to our committee. There is a different word for that than collusion, and it’s called ‘compromise’.”

NewsGuard: The Anatomy Of What Censorship Looks Like,www.therussophile.org,Activist Post,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/newsguard-the-anatomy-of-what-censorship-looks-like.html/,"By Joe Martino
In Brief The Facts: FakeNews watchdog NewsGuard aims to hold independent media accountable for their stories. Funded by Clinton donors and big pharma, with ties tot he CFR, NewsGuard seems to have a clear agenda in favor of mainstream media. Reflect On: The image for this article was chosen specifically. Many are attempting to make it feel like the internet is a fake news haven, but is mainstream media just as guilty? More? Be sure to listen to our podcast on this topic!
You may recall an expose we did on NewsGuard back in January 2019 . We covered who owns NewsGuard, the various agencies tied to the company and how their ratings have gone thus far.
At the time, the CFR-linked and Big Pharma-funded ‘fake news watchdog’ had not yet ‘vetted’ Collective Evolution and thus we had no direct experience with them yet. But the day did eventually come! Before they got to us, NewsGuard was already clear in its approach: give poor ratings to anyone in alternative news, alternative health or who didn’t cover things in classic mainstream narratives.
Note: you can explore this entire story with us via our podcast episode here.
This isn’t a secret either. The app has a very low rating on Google’s store, and many of the reviews of the app all reveal what’s going on quite clearly as it isn’t hard to see.
Tor-Andreas BråtenModified Jan 24, 2019Good idea, poorly executed. I would like to see this done by an unbiased AI rather than biased people. Try to see what the news sites are “pushing”; Is it USA Neo Liberal friendly news, then green check. Everything else, proceed with caution… I know I’m biased myself, but this is beyond ridiculous…
Artex JayModified Jan 26, 2019Needs to be worked on a lot. Has potential but at the moment seems to be quite biased. Favoring mainstream sites over the independent ones who give either a different opinion or does not run with the same leftist narrative like CNN.
John LittleModified Jan 24, 2019This horrifyingly biased ‘news guard’ will only filter out views that disagree with neocon and center-left opinion. News sites with a history of falsifying reports and sloppy fact checking sail right on through this ‘addon’. You should ONLY install this, if you like a good ‘brainwash’.
Dennis KapatosModified Feb 1, 2019Stay away! This cr-app is garbage and was created with the intention to push people towards the neocon/neoliberal perspective. Just search the internet for NewsGuard. Their board of advisers includes many neocons including Tom Ridge and Michael Hayden.
Grant SternModified Nov 21, 2018This is a biased news ratings plugin designed to decry perspective in journalism.
Michael La Riviere Mar 26, 2019The concept with NewsGuard is to instill doubt when it comes to authentic and true news which refutes government propaganda. One has to obtain the news on any government issues away from mainstream media because they are extremely reluctant to post anything that is not right wing propaganda. Beware of this App!
It’s all about doubt. Instead of examining a story, much like Snopes might do, NewsGuard simply tries to tells you to proceed with caution or proceed safely. There is no clarity on what a website does right or wrong regularly. For example, if a website spent 2 years falsely reporting a story in hundreds of articles and broadcasts, you’d think that might get a poor rating, vs a website that may make a couple of journalistic mistakes and corrects them. But a user has no clarity of this when using the app. Declare Your Independence! Profit outside the rigged system! Protect yourself from tyranny and economic collapse. Learn to live free and spread peace!
Counter Markets Newsletter – Trends & Strategies for Maximum Freedom
Thus it’s all about creating doubt so people will stay away. Given almost all of the independent media has a “proceed with caution” rating, the agenda seems clear here. Our Story
I received an email from someone named John Gregory at NewsGuard. He said he had some questions for me and would love to talk before they publish our rating. This was on March 19th, 2019 and 5:50 PM EST. I was able to properly read this email by 3:00 PM EST March 20th, 2019, by that point John and the NewsGuard team had already published their rating regardless of having not spoken to me.
They of course published in their rating, which has now since changed slightly, “Joe Martino did not answer our email discussing our rating.”
This was tactic number one that, after research, NewsGuard seems to do to many people. Allege that you do not respond, when in reality you just haven’t got it in the very short time period they give you prior to publishing their rating. I responded on the 20th of March and let them know I was aware of their organization, had done a story on them in January and ended up preferring to not engage with their organization as they have a track record of not listening to nor taking anything seriously that is said in response to their baseless claims.
After all, how do you speak to a company about vaccines and health research when they are funded by pharmaceutical giants?
I knew this as I had already done my research and spoken to many friends in alternative media who have had this happen to them. For example, my friend Sayer over at GreenMedInfo , a website that publishes articles based on the database of research and scientific studies it compiles, told me that he went through the entire process with NewsGuard and it was like talking to a wall. Their illogical methods and agendas as the first and foremost at the company, not unbiased journalism. NewsGuard’s Focus
We recorded a podcast episode exploring our NewsGuard rating and going through the stories they claim are fake, when in reality they are simply spinning words to have them say whatever they wish to report to users.
NewsGuard decided to define Collective Evolution as “A website that regularly promotes debunked conspiracy theories like vaccines cause autism and that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were staged.” Yet it gives CNN who, like other mainstream media outlets, have come under fire lately for 2 years of false reporting on Russian collusion, the Convington kids story, and the Jussie Smollet story, a perfect rating, defining them as “A website of Cable News Network (CNN), the first Television network in the United States dedicated exclusively to news. Founded in 1980 by media businessman Ted Turner, CNN pioneered the 24-hour news cycle.”
You’ll notice, one is a nice about section as seen with CNN’s rating, the other is a slam at an organization as seen in our rating. That alone should tell you what NewsGuard’s intentions are: create doubt and fear.
In the end, NewsGuard went after us for 9/11, talking about UFOs, and talking about vaccines. They claim all these things are debunked conspiracies when in reality they are not, and when we discuss them we do so with research, integrity and studies. We talked about all of this on our recent podcast episode here.
I and Arjun Walia, a senior journalist at CE, went through every aspect of their rating and discussed the lack of proper research on NewsGuard’s part in the podcast episode. Our purpose here was to not only show the lack of proper research on NewsGuard’s part but also to illustrate the overall thought processes and irresponsible journalism that goes into much of the censorship we see today.
This is important as many of us are not quite aware of how these decisions are coming to be, as well as who exactly the people and institutions are behind censorship. In the case of NewsGuard, you have severe conflicts of interest going out to essentially clean up ‘bad press’ being put out against large corporations and Big Pharma . Luckily, not many are downloading nor using NewsGuard’s app.
Joe Martino — I founded CE 9 years ago as I love inspiring others to find joy, peace and make lasting shifts in consciousness in their lives. I’ve been working to formulate a new style of media, ‘Conscious Media,’ that tells stories without polarity and division. That digs to the truth and isn’t afraid to look, and that helps viewers make change in their lives as a result of what they view.

I met journalist and friend Rafiq Lutf and cameraman Abdul-Mun’aim Arnous in January 2018 and I was honoured when Rafiq asked me to work with him on his film project, The Veto.
As Dr Shaaban said to me in August 2016, “ Western propaganda is paid for in Syrian blood ”. This is true. The horrifying bloodshed and loss of life in Syria could never have happened without the colonial media manufacturing consent for another illegal war against a Sovereign nation.
The Veto tracks the evolution of the propaganda campaign waged by Western media against Syria. From Baba Amr in Homs 2011/2012 until the modern day “propaganda construct” – the NATO-member-state funded White Helmets . It honours Russia and China’s vetoes that have consistently defended Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the UN.
George Orwell said “ The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history .” Western media has been tasked with writing the history of the Syrian conflict to serve the aggressors in the US Coalition of terrorism.
As Dr Shaaban also told me:
“The US alliance and its media are focusing on our history, material history, cultural history, identity , our army. Any power that keeps you as an entire state, or any statesman that represents strength or unity will be demonized and destroyed.”
The Veto exposes the criminal intentions of Western media and it archives the progression of the propaganda war waged by the West against Syria. Syrians are writing the history of the Syrian conflict because Syria and her allies have courageously resisted the Imperialist machine.
As Rafiq has said so eloquently “we are the Veto” and we must use it against the Industrial Media Complex in the West. Syria’s history belongs to the Syrians and Syria’s final victory must ensure that Western media is never again given the power to destroy a nation, divide its people and promote international terrorism both military and economic.
Examples of propaganda to support the Syrian war (which resulted in countless deaths and destruction):"

Now let’s talk about another aspect of the firing of James Comey which spawned the assignment of Robert Mueller as special counsel by Rod Rosenstein. This cannot be stressed enough. Here is an actual copy of the memo sent to President Trump advising him to fire James Comey by Rod Rosenstein.
QUOTE –
www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39866767
I hope you can read the following Rosenstein memo, and you will be realizing that President Trump was set up to fire James Comey by his own Justice Department. By the way, Jeff Sessions approved this memo.
Then as soon as Trump fired Comey, Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to the Mueller Investigation.
It was a setup.
Memorandum for the Attorney General
FROM: Rod J Rosenstein
SUBJECT: Restoring public confidence in the FBI
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has long been regarded as our nation’s premier federal investigative agency. Over the past year, however, the FBI’s reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice. That is deeply troubling to many Department employees and veterans, legislators and citizens.
The current FBI Director is an articulate and persuasive speaker about leadership and the immutable principles of the Department of Justice. He deserves our appreciation for his public service. As you and I have discussed, however, I cannot defend the Director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.
The director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General’s authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution. It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement. At most, the the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors. The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed attorney General Loretta Lynch had a conflict. But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department. There is a well-established process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General. On July 5, however, the Director announced his own conclusions about the nation’s most sensitive criminal investigation, without the authorization of duly appointed Justice Department leaders.
What was Clinton FBI probe about?
Compounding the error, the Director ignored another longstanding principle: we do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation. Derogatory information sometimes is disclosed in the course of criminal investigations and prosecutions, but we never release it gratuitously. The Director laid out his version of the facts for the news media as if it were a closing argument, but without a trial. It is a textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do.
In response to skeptical question at a congressional hearing, the Director defended his remarks by saying that his “goal was to say what is true. What did we do, what did we find, what do we think about it.” But the goal of a federal criminal investigation is not to announce our thoughts at a press conference. The goal is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify a federal criminal prosecution, then allow a federal prosecutor who exercises authority delegated by the Attorney General to make a prosecutorial decision, and then – if prosecution is warranted – let the judge and jury determine the facts. We sometimes release information about closed investigations in appropriate ways, but the FBI does not do it sua sponte.
Concerning his letter to the Congress on October 28, 2016, the Director cast his decision as a choice between whether he would “speak” about the FBI’s decision to investigate the newly-discovered email messages or “conceal” it. “Conceal” is a loaded term that misstates the issue. When federal agents and prosecutors quietly open a criminal investigation, we are not concealing anything; we are simply following the longstanding policy that we refrain from publicizing non-public information. In that context, silence is not concealment.
My perspective on these issues is shared by former Attorneys General and Deputy Attorneys General from different eras and both political parties. Judge Laurence Silberman, who served as Deputy Attorneys General under President Ford, wrote that “it is not the bureau’s responsibility to opine on whether a matter should be prosecuted.” Silberman believes that the Director’s “Performance was so inappropriate for an FBI director that [he] doubt[s] the bureau will ever completely recover.” Jamie Gorelick, Deputy Attorney General under President George W. Bush, to opine that the Director had “chosen personally to restrike the balance between transparency and fairness, department from the department’s traditions.” They concluded that the Director violated his obligation to “preserve, protect and defend” the traditions of the Department and the FBI.
Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who served under President George W Bush, observed the Director “stepped way outside his job in disclosing the recommendation in that fashion” because the FBI director “doesn’t make that decision”. Alberto Gonzales, who also served as Attorneys General under President George W Bush, called the decision “an error in judgement.” Eric Holder, who served as Deputy Attorneys General under President Clinton and Attorneys General under President Obama, said that the Director’s decision “was incorrect. It violated long-standing Justice Department policies and traditions. And it ran counter to guidance that I put in place four years ago laying out the proper way to conduct investigations during an election season.” Holder concluded that the Director “broke with these fundamental principles” and “negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI”.
Former Deputy Attorneys General Gorelick and Thompson described the unusual event as “real-time, raw-take transparency taken to its illogical limit, a kind of reality TV of federal criminal investigation,” that is “antithetical to the interests of justice”.
Donald Ayer, who served as Deputy Attorneys General under President HW Bush, along with former Justice Department officials, was “astonished and perplexed” by the decision to “break[] with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections.” Ayer’s letter noted, “Perhaps most troubling… is the precedent set by this departure from the Department’s widely-respected, non-partisan traditions.”
We should reject the departure and return to the traditions.
Although the President has the power to remove an FBI director, the decision should not be taken lightly. I agree with the nearly unanimous opinions of former Department officials. The way the Director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a Director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them. Having refused to admit his errors, the Director cannot be expected to implement the necessary corrective actions. End of Quote
Another aspect to the memo no one has spoken about is being reported by ‘Law and Crime.’
lawandcrime.com/legal-analysis/rosensteins-secret-special-counsel-memo-was-written-after-the-feds-already-raided-manaforts-house/ Quote – The memo gives Mueller a more specific description of his authority and states that he can investigate Paul Manafort for any “crimes arising out of payments he received from the Ukrainian government before and during the tenure of President Viktor Yanukovych.” And that’s pretty much what Manafort was indicted for.
Here’s the weird part about this: The Rosenstein “secret” memo revealed in this week’s court filing is dated August 2, 2017. According to media reports, Paul a home was raided July 26, 2017. So that means Rosenstein’s laid out the more specified scope and definition of authority for the special counsel investigation six days after Manafort’s home had already been raided.
What does this mean legally? Well, as always, the the legal experts are divided.
“There is something very wrong about that,” said Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz on Fox News Tuesday night, adding that the scope of the investigation should be clearly defined. “This special prosecutor is looking at everything. Where does it stop?” End of Quote
In conclusion, it may be necessary to review past facts to understand what is happening in the present day. The Rosenstein memo makes no sense, unless he wanted Trump to fire Comey. If this is true, why did he appoint Robert Mueller to investigate as a special counsel?
And as far as Carter Page goes, if he was ‘Male 1’ in the FBI undercover sting to catch the group of Russian spies, he was in fact undercover FBI.
He admits the FBI leaked this.
Why would the FBI seek a FISA warrant on him, and why has he not been charged?
Obama used him as he did have contact with Russian agents when he worked with the FBI to catch them. He could be utilized again to make a case for the FISA warrant. Yet he was never charged. And when he was allegedly used by the FBI for the FISA warrant, this meant when he was inside the Trump group, everyone he contacted could be spied on.
Carter Page is smarter than he acts.

Nothing captures our collective imagination quite like emerging technology.
In a short amount of time, technological innovations such as wireless internet and social networking have become a ubiquitous part of our everyday lives, quietly transforming the way we live, work, and communicate. Other promising technologies have their moment in the sun, only to fade into obscurity.
Gartner’s Hype Cycle charts the roller coaster ride of emerging tech, from the first stirrings of public awareness to the point of wider adoption and economic viability. Today’s graphic is a retrospective look at which trends scaled the summit of the Hype Cycle each year since 2000. Reaching the Peak
As the media searches for the next big thing, certain technologies tend to dominate the headlines. Meanwhile, venture capital flows into the companies racing to bring the tech to market, valuations swell, marketing departments generate excitement, and the expectations of the general public begin to grow as well.
One example of this phenomenon at work is the adoption of microblogging. Today, we don’t think twice about posting a tweet or updating our status on Facebook, but a decade ago, the act of posting a short public message was major shift in the way people used technology to communicate with one another. The intense buzz that sent microblogging towards the top of the Hype Cycle is corroborated by Google Search data. Living Up to the Hype
A few technologies transcend the hype to transform entire industries. Here are some examples that lived up to their time in the spotlight.
Cloud Computing Right from the beginning, the analogy of data breaking the shackles of folders and clunky external drives – instead zipping efficiently into the invisible cloud – generated a lot of excitement. It felt like the future of computing, and enterprises and individuals eagerly adopted the technology.
Today, Microsoft and Amazon’s cloud computing divisions each make $6-7 billion in revenue per quarter, and that number is still growing at a brisk pace.
NFC Payments Near Field Communication – the technology that enables contactless payments – is transforming the way people pay for purchases around the world.
The global contactless payments market is expected to reach $138.4 billion by 2023. Here’s a look at where NFC payments are making the greatest in-roads: The Ones That Underwhelmed
During the Christmas season of 2009, Kindle became the most gifted item in Amazon’s history. This watershed moment looked like the end of physical books as the public embraced the e-reader as the new way of consuming text.
Fast-forward to today, and only 19% of adults in the U.S. own an e-reader.
Of course, not every technology that grabs the headlines is going to become the next iPhone. Here are some others that didn’t immediately meet expectations after topping the Hype Cycle.
m-Commerce Some concepts fail primarily because they’re ahead of their time. Such is the case with mobile commerce.
By 2001, more than half of Americans owned mobile phones, and this represented a huge opportunity. Unfortunately, early m-commerce was restricted by the limitations of mobile phones of that time period. It wasn’t until the introduction of smartphones that the concept really took off. Today, nearly half of all online transactions are made via mobile devices.
3D Printing Few technologies reach the fever pitch that 3D printing did in 2012. From the $1.4 billion merger of the largest players in the sector to the reports of firearm blueprints circulating the web, you could forgive people for believing that the 3D printer was destined to become the next microwave. In the end, interest in 3D printing leveled off.
While it is getting used for prototyping in many different industries , it remains to be seen whether the technology will ever achieve the wide consumer-level adoption that was promised. What’s Next?
When 2019’s Hype Cycle is released later this year, it remains to be seen which technology will rise to the top. Based on the trajectory from last year, search volume, and current news reports, 5G is a strong competitor.

Since last November I’ve been forecasting that we are likely moving into another Dark Window of spectacular gains before a big crash in early 2020.
It didn’t look that way into December when stocks were down 20% or more, the largest correction since 2011 during the euro and Greek crisis. But my short-term indicators were saying this was not yet a crash, just another correction.
Yet the Fed backed off its aggressive tightening stance. Capitulating to Trump? More like the slowing global economy from Europe to China.
The response brought a sharp rally: Markets are still high “on the crack” and raring to go on good news.
After the 20% to 25% rally in March, the markets looked like they might take a break and correct before exploding up into the next wave …
But the markets won’t back off. In fact, they’re now looking for the second relief switch…
Currently, stocks look likely to retest the late September/early October highs before taking a substantial correction.
Oh, it’s got to be imminent. China needs it more than us as they export three to four times to us what we export to them…
But you have to remember that China has a long-term plan: To become the number 1 country in the world and supplant the U.S. leadership since World War II. They are more willing to take more pain for that than we are…
And Chairman Xi is now largely grandfathered in forever as their leader.
I cover this “peak in globalization” in Zero Hour with a great long-term chart with peaking surges in global trade in 1913 and NOW – every 100 years or so.
Trade just seemed to peak recently, as this chart shows.
Donald Trump should be worried about that. The president is perhaps the most controversial figure to hold office in history. He knows he needs to get re-elected in 2020.
And I am predicting the greatest crash in our lifetime to likely start by early 2020…
Uh-oh.
He’s not aware of that threat, given the confidence he’s shown in his 3% to 4% growth economy, although that already seems to be fading fast as I forecast . But he needs this deal to look good even though the near-term consequences do not hurt him as much as they do China’s economy, although China’s recent reprieve on the Mueller report gives him a boost.
Beyond that, China’s recent stimulus now seems to be working, and current statistics like the Purchasing Managers Index and its stock market are up strongly again. Maybe China does not need this deal quite so urgently near term…
Either way, the deal is likely to go ahead in some form. And that could launch the next wave up of the Dark Window blow-off rally.
We may still see a more substantial correction in the next week or two as I have been forecasting if this deal continues to delay. But if it does go through, the markets are likely to surge upward, maybe very short term, and then a sell-off after the news. Or, the beginning of the next wave up into June/July that could see substantial new highs and prove the Dark Window scenario more fully.
My preferred scenario is that we see a minor setback over the next couple weeks, then the markets rally into the next strong surge up into the summer – on the way up to a final massive peak into September… or January at the latest.
This trade issue with China is clearly the linchpin, either way…
Do you see now why I almost always have two scenarios in the near term and only one scenario in the longer term? The near term has many more cycles at play and politics matter much more.
I’ll keep you updated.

Where Is The World Headed?
Paul Craig Roberts
Since 2016 the United States has been in the Russiagate box, a hoax created by the US military/security complex to prevent President Trump from normalizing relations with Russia. Normalized relations would devalue THE RUSSIAN THREAT, an orchestration that protects the $1,000 billion annual budget of the military/security complex.
The Democratic Party, which most certainly is not democratic, supported the hoax hoping to do Trump in for their own reasons and pulled the presstitute media into the conspiracy against Trump.
Now that all the assurances from the Establishment that Trump was a traitor to America who conspired with Russian President Putin to steal the election from the killer-bitch in order that America could serve Russian interests have been exposed as lies by the Mueller report, American attention is free to take up some other nonsensical campaign. The succession of these stupidities is destroying America’s reputation.
True, some of the most crazed of the Democrats and media whores cannot let go of Russiagate. The presstitutes are saying that Trump would be impeached for his non-crime except the unworthy Democrats had rather go back to the business of spending other people’s money. A crazed professor or two have declared that Mueller was part of the “Trump coverup” and that Mueller needs to be investigated. But these claims simply underline that the United States wasted three years of its existence.
Meanwhile, other countries moved on. The Russians, for example, discovered that Washington’s sanctions had a silver lining. Russia became more self-sufficient economically and moved out of the box of being an exporter of raw materials to the West, a box into which the Americans and the American-brainwashed Russian economics profession had put the Russian government.
The fulminations and threats from Washington against Russia brought forth new Russian weapon systems for which the US has no match or defense, weapons that demote the US to a second-rate military power.
On an adjusted basis, China now has the world’s largest economy and increasingly ignores Washington’s blustering. As does Iran.
Even Venezuela stands up to Washington.
The world is concluding that Washington is not the power it thinks it is.
Washington’s abuse of its reserve currency role and violations of international law have encouraged a movement away from the use of the dollar in international transactions. This is perhaps even a more serious threat to Washington’s power than Russia’s superior military capabilities.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt was happy to see World War II because he understood that it would leave Britain bankrupt and without an empire. Roosevelt understood that the gain would be America’s, because the US would take over the reserve currency role. The reason this is important is that the reserve currency country can pay its bills by printing money. Thus, the government has no budget constraints.
For a country as indebted as America, to lose this role would be a crushing blow. It is this blow that Washington faces as a result of its idiotic policy of sanctions and disrespect of international law.
And there is another blow. Just as the Roman Empire fell to invaders who crossed the frontiers of the empire, so is Washington’s empire falling. Europe, the crown jewel of the empire, is now overrun with millions of unassimilable peoples to the extent that Europe is no longer European. The President of the US has so far been powerless to defend the borders of the United States. Indeed, the Democratic Party and the presstitute media are totally opposed to any defense of American borders. Why does a government unwilling to defend its borders spend $1,000 billion annually on defense?
The American Neoconservative Zionists, who have controlled US foreign policy in Israel’s interest since the Clinton regime, continue to operate as if we still live in an unipolar world. For some reason the National Security Advisor to President Trump has poor sources of information. He speaks as if he rules the world, but even Washington’s pathetic European vassals did not go along with Trump’s gift of the Syrian Golan Heights to Israel.
As for moral authority, after, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yeman, Ukraine, Honduras, and now Venezuela, all moral authority has vacated the West.
Washington is not only losing its economic and military power but also its soft power that rested in Washington’s propaganda about making the world safe for democracy. Democracy is not even safe in the United States as Democrats and the presstitutes have done their best to overturn democracy and to drive the elected president from office, which is precisely what the Trump regime is trying to do to Venezuela.
All of the lies and propaganda that have portrayed the West as God’s gift to humanity have fallen away as the result of Washington’s irresponsible use of power, leaving the West morally naked.
The world no longer thinks that the West is something to look up to and to emulate. Instead, the world sees a great evil, in the words of Matt Taibbi, “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.”
A great promise was betrayed by those trusted with the promise. A government accountable to law and to the people requires a united people, not the disunity of multiculturalism and Identity Politics. With the indigenous ethnic base of all of the Western countries under attack as “white supremacists,” the West can no longer defend its culture from the immigrants who do not share the culture.
The tension between an indigenous culture and imported cultures can be seen in the tensions between Hungary and the EU and Italy and the EU. Hungary has refused to accept its quota of non-European immigrants and faces punishment by the EU. In Italy the government is in the hands of a coalition of leftwing and rightwing parties that are united in their opposition to the EU and non-European immigration. In Europe the situation is one in which the EU government, as well as the governments of member states such as France and Germany, have taken the side of immigrants against the indigenous people. In other words, the governments of Europe are not committed to their own cultures. This is the unmistakable sign of a dead culture.
In the United States there is so much disunity that to call the states united is a misuse of words. Hillary voters hate Trump voters, and vice versa. The presstitute media and universities are uniformly anti-white.
Countries without unity are not strong. Consequently, the Western world is losing its leadership of the world.
Of course, the rest of the world also suffers from disunity. The Sunni and the Shiites cannot unite, with the consequence that the Muslim world is weak. The tribes in Africa cannot unite. India and Pakistan stay at each other’s throats. Animosities exist among Asians. Russia herself is a federation. China has a Muslim province. But the disunities are different from those in the West. Japan and China have differences but the population of Japan is homogeneous and China largely is. Arabs are Arabs whether Sunni or Shiite. The Russian Federation is the remains of an old empire, largely assimilated, not the result of recent immigrations.
The consequence of disunity perhaps precludes any leadership. But the collapse of the West into diversity and multiculturalism definitely means that Western leadership has been lost to the weakness of disunity.
Is it chaos that awaits?

Petrodollar Panic: Saudis Threaten To Dump USD-Oil Trades Over OPEC Anti-Trust Bill,www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/petrodollar-panic-saudis-threaten-to-dump-usd-oil-trades-over-opec-anti-trust-bill.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Three year ago – almost to the day – Saudi Arabia rattled its first sabre towards the United States, with an implicit threat to dump US Treasuries over Congress’ decision to allow the Saudis to be held responsible for the 9/11 attacks.
In a stunning report at the time by the NYTimes , Saudi Arabia told the Obama administration and members of Congress that it will sell off hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of American assets held by the kingdom if Congress passes a bill that would allow the Saudi government to be held responsible in American courts for any role in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Then, six months ago , the Saudis once again threatened to weaponize their wealth as the biggest importer of arms from America in the world.
You will find more infographics at Statista
And now , Reuters reports, citing three unidentified people familiar with Saudi energy policy, Saudi Arabia is threatening to drop the dollar as its main currency in selling its oil if the U.S. passes a bill that exposes OPEC members to U.S. antitrust lawsuits .
While the death of the petrodollar has long been predicted (as the petroyuan gathers momentum), this is the most direct threat yet to the USDollar’s exorbitant privilege…
“The Saudis know they have the dollar as the nuclear option,” one of the sources familiar with the matter said.
“The Saudis say: let the Americans pass NOPEC and it would be the U.S. economy that would fall apart,” another source said.
Riyadh reportedly communicated the threat to senior U.S. energy officials , one person briefed on Saudi oil policy told Reuters
As Reuters details, NOPEC, or the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, was first introduced in 2000 and aims to remove sovereign immunity from U.S. antitrust law, paving the way for OPEC states to be sued for curbing output in a bid to raise oil prices.
While the bill has never made it into law despite numerous attempts, the legislation has gained momentum since U.S. President Donald Trump came to office. Trump said he backed NOPEC in a book published in 2011 before he was elected, though he not has not voiced support for NOPEC as president.
Trump has instead stressed the importance of U.S-Saudi relations, including sales of U.S. military equipment, even after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year.
A move by Saudi Arabia to ditch the dollar would resonate well with big non-OPEC oil producers such as Russia as well as major consumers China and the European Union, which have been calling for moves to diversify global trade away from the dollar to dilute U.S. influence over the world economy.
Russia, which is subject to U.S. sanctions, has tried to sell oil in euros and China’s yuan but the proportion of its sales in those currencies is not significant.
Venezuela and Iran, which are also under U.S. sanctions, sell most of their oil in other currencies but they have done little to challenge the dollar’s hegemony in the oil market.
However, if a long-standing U.S. ally such as Saudi Arabia joined the club of non-dollar oil sellers it would be a far more significant move likely to gain traction within the industry.
Perhaps this explains why Russia has been dumping dollars in favors of gold in recent months …
And why China suddenly admitted to increased gold reserves…
And why there has been a spike in yuan buying by reserve managers last year, as the IMF pointed out in a recent report.
So the next time you hear an analyst on CNBC categorically dismiss the notion that the loss of the dollar’s reserve currency status isn’t something that markets should take seriously (even as several credible voices have warned that it should be), you’d do well to remember this chart.
Nothing lasts forever."
Was John Brennan The Russia Lie Ringleader?,www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/was-john-brennan-the-russia-lie-ringleader.html/,"Authored by Monica Crowley, op-ed via The Washington Times,
The best defense, the saying goes, is a good offense.
The key orchestrators of the Big Trump-Russia Collusion Lie seem to have hewed tightly to that tactical advice.
Over the past two years, one of their biggest “tells” has been their hyper-aggressive and gratuitous attacks on the president. Given that special counsel Robert Mueller ’s investigation found no collusion or obstruction of justice, their constant broadsides now look, in retrospect, like calculated pre-emptive strikes to deflect attention and culpability away from themselves.
By accusing Mr. Trump of what they themselves were guilty of, they created a masterful distraction through projection.
We now know that former FBI Director James Comey and his deputy, Andrew McCabe, are hip-deep in the conspiracy. Both wrote supposed “tell-all” books and carpet-bombed the media with interviews in which they regularly flung criminal accusations against the president. Whenever asked about their own roles, they reverted to denouncing Mr. Trump .
With Mr. Mueller ’s findings, Mr. Comey ’s and Mr. McCabe’s media benders look increasingly suspicious.
As do those of their comrades in the Obama national security apparatus, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and his partner in possible crime, former CIA Director John Brennan , who, apart from former President Barack Obama himself, may be the biggest player of them all.
Any investigation into the origins and execution of the Big Lie must focus on Mr. Brennan , whose job as the nation’s chief spook would have prohibited him, by law, from engaging in any domestic political spy games.
Of course, the law didn’t stop him from illegally spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee by hacking into its computers and lying repeatedly about it, prompting Democratic senators to call for his resignation.
Once out of Langley, Mr. Brennan tore into Mr. Trump, accusing him of “treason” (among other crimes) in countless television appearances and bitter tweets. It got so vicious that Mr. Trump pulled his security clearance.
Consider a few critical data points.
The Obama Department of Justice and FBI targeting of two low-level Trump aides, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, was carried out in the spring of 2016 because they wanted to spy on the Trump campaign but needed a way in. They enlisted an American academic and shadowy FBI informant named Stefan Halper to repeatedly sidle up to both Mr. Papadopoulos and Mr. Page. But complementing his work for the FBI , Mr. Halper had a side gig as an intelligence operative with longstanding ties to the CIA and British intelligence MI6.
Another foreign professor, Joseph Mifsud, who played an important early part in targeting Papadopoulos, also had abiding ties to the CIA , MI6 and the British foreign secretary.
A third operative, Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, targeted Mr. Papadopoulos in a London bar. It was Mr. Downer’s “tip” to the FBI that provided the justification for the start of Russia counterintelligence investigation, complete with fraudulently-obtained FISA warrants to spy on the Trump campaign.
All of these interactions reek of entrapment. Mr. Papadopoulos now says, “I believe Australian and UK intelligence were involved in an active operation to target Trump and his associates.” Like Mr. Halper and Mr. Mifsud, Mr. Downer had ties to the CIA , MI6 and (surprise!) the Clintons.
Given the deep intelligence backgrounds of these folks, it’s difficult to believe that former DOJ/ FBI officials such as Peter Strzok or even James Comey and Andrew McCabe on their own devised the plan to deploy them.
So: who did? How did the relationships with Messrs. Halper, Mifsud and Downer come about? Who suggested them for these tasks? To whom did they report? How were they compensated?
Any investigation must follow the money — and the personnel. There were plenty of DOJ/ FBI officials involved, but what about intelligence officials? Was Mr. Brennan a central player in the hoax, which would help explain the participation of Mr. Halper, Mr. Mifsud and Mr. Downer? Intel officials are likely to draw on other intelligence operatives.
There is also a glimpse of a paper trail.
Fox News’ Catherine Herridge reported last week that “in a Dec. 12, 2016 text, [ FBI lawyer Lisa] Page wrote to McCabe: “Btw, Clapper told Pete that he was meeting with Brennan and Cohen for dinner tonight. Just FYSA [for your situational awareness ].”
“Within a minute, McCabe replied, “OK.”
Ms. Herridge notes that those named are likely Peter Strzok and Mr. Brennan ’s then-deputy, David Cohen. Ms. Herridge also notes that while we don’t yet know what was discussed during the dinner, government sources thought it “irregular” for Mr. Clapper to be in contact with the more junior-level Mr. Strzok. She also points out that the text came “during a critical time for the Russia probe.”
Indeed. It was right before the publication of the ICA, the official Intelligence Community Assessment of Russian 2016 election interference.
As Paul Sperry has reported, “A source close to the House investigation said Brennan himself selected the CIA and FBI analysts who worked on the ICA, and that they included former FBI counterespionage chief Peter Strzok.
“Strzok was the intermediary between Brennan and Comey , and he was one of the authors of the ICA,” according to the source.” Recall that the dossier-based ICA was briefed to Obama , Trump and Congress ahead of Trump’s inauguration.
Post- Mueller report, Mr. Brennan is spinning wildly that perhaps his early condemnations of Mr. Trump were based on “bad information.”
These are just some of the threads suggesting Mr. Brennan may be one of the Masters of the Big Lie, requiring full investigation.
If the devil is in the details, Mr. Brennan is all over the details.
No wonder he — and his fellow caballers — have been so loud. They doth protest too much.

UN Security Council to hold emergency meeting on Libya on Friday,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/un-security-council-to-hold-emergency-meeting-on-libya-on-friday.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
MOSCOW, April 5. /TASS/. The United Nations Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on the situation in Libya at 3 pm (22:00 Moscow Time) on Friday, the United Kingdom Mission to the UN wrote on its Twitter page.
“The UK has called for the UN Security Council to meet in closed consultations on #Libya at 3 pm tomorrow, Friday,” it said. Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) Ghassan Salame will brief the UNSC members on the current situation.
On Thursday, Commander of the Libyan National Army Khalifa Haftar ordered his troops to launch an offensive on the capital, vowing to liberate it from all illegal armed groups. He noted that the Libyan National Army “had heard the call” of Tripoli’s people.
Prime Minister of Tripoli’s Government of National Accord Fayez al-Sarraj ordered all military units controlled by him to be on full combat alert, giving the green light to airstrikes in order to “defend the civilian population and crucial facilities.”
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is currently in Tripoli, where he held meetings with representatives of the country’s authorities. He called on the conflicting sides to stop military escalation.
Guterres is planning to meet with Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar on Friday, Al Arabiya TV channel reported. The talks are expected to be held in Benghazi, located 1,000 km to the east of Tripoli, and will focus on the situation in the country amid the army’s offensive against the capital.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova voiced hope that a military scenario won’t be implemented in Libya.

Russian embassy blasts Lithuania’s new sentence as spy hysteria,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/russian-embassy-blasts-lithuanias-new-sentence-as-spy-hysteria.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
MOSCOW, April 5. /TASS/. Russia’s Embassy in Lithuania views a sentence to Lithuanian citizen Roman Sesel accused of spying for Russia as part of Vilnius’ course on whipping up spy hysteria, the diplomatic mission said in a comment on its website.
“We are not familiar with another “Russian spy” labeled so by Lithuania’s Prosecutor-General’s Office, Lithuanian citizen of Klaipeda Roman Sesel, who was sentenced to seven years in prison. At the same time, we cannot consider this criminal process separate from the course taken by the official Vilnius on whipping up spy hysteria, where Russia and its intelligence services are named as a major threat to national security,” the embassy said.
The diplomatic mission was surprised that Lithuania’s judicial bodies “interpreted” local criminal legislation in a way making it possible to bring to responsibility for obtaining data from open sources and providing a broad opportunity to prosecute citizens on political motives.
On April 3, the Klaipeda district court sentenced Lithuanian citizen Roman Sesel to seven years in jail for allegedly spying for Russia. Sesel denied the accusations, stating that he had not fulfilled any tasks of foreign special services.
According to the case files, since 2015 until his detention in December 2017 Sesel had allegedly collected information on Latvia’s Navy and NATO military vessels entering Klaipeda and military vessels, and also on a liquefied natural gas terminal working at the port. The prosecutors said the suspect collected unclassified information but his steps may be considered as criminal since this had been done upon the order of foreign intelligence services.

Riga mayor dismissed from office after corruption scandal,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/riga-mayor-dismissed-from-office-after-corruption-scandal.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
MOSCOW, April 5. /TASS/. Riga Mayor Nils Usakovs has been dismissed from his office, Latvia’s Minister for Environmental Protection and Regional Development Juris Puce said in an instruction published in a government paper on Friday.
“In accordance with Part 1 of Article 93 of the Law “On local self-governing authorities” I dismiss Nils Usakovs from his post of the Riga Duma (Council) chairman for failure to fulfill duties under the law and violating regulatory acts,” the document says.
These alleged violations include inconsistencies in a report on the registered capital of the Riga transportation enterprise Rigas satiksme and budget injections in it. The document says that Usakovs is fully responsible for all inconsistencies as a mayor of Latvia’s capital.
This instruction can be challenged in court within 30 days.
In late January, the Corruption Prevention Bureau carried out searches at the office and home of Nils Usakovs in connection with a criminal case related to this transportation enterprise, which was at the center of a major corruption scandal at the end of last year. This was related to the supplies of trolley buses and buses at an inflated price. The mayor rejected all accusations against him. Latvia’s nationalists demanded his resignation, but Usakovs retained his post.
Later, Environmental Protection and Regional Development Minister Juris Puce stated that the ministry had launched an investigation into the activities of the Riga Duma. On March 21, the ministry announced that the checks had been completed and alleged violations of the law had been uncovered. The Riga mayor was given a week-long deadline to clarify the situation.
According to the local legislation, the Environmental Protection and Regional Development Minister has the right to dismiss the mayor or initiate the dissolution of the Riga Duma. Earlier, Usakovs had stated many times that should any illegal decision be taken on dismissing him, he would appeal it in court.

"Mike Pompeo’s “Version of Jesus Christ”: Endless Wars, Open-Ended Surveillance at Home",www.therussophile.org,J.C.,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/mike-pompeos-version-of-jesus-christ-endless-wars-open-ended-surveillance-at-home.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

Where does Trump’s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo get his inspiration? From Jesus Christ.
Mike’s version of Jesus Christ may not be the same one millions of others know. The Pompeo version of Christ is a psychopath and a full-throated defender of endless war abroad and open-ended surveillance at home.
The Christ followed by Pompeo believes the official enemies of America should be starved to death, go without electricity, have their industries sabotaged by sanctions and mEndless alware, and expect to have their leaders brutally assassinated.
Pompeo is a non-Jewish neocon. His adoration for the apartheid state of Israel is boundless.
Trump’s secretary of state would be more comfortable in the Old Testament where an eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth is advised in response to transgressions, both real and imagined. It’s difficult to believe Mike follows the Sermon on the Mount. Christ teaches that if slapped on your right cheek, turn the other cheek in response. For Mike, an adversary doesn’t need to slap a cheek before he is killed by a fusillade of cruise missiles and white phosphorus.
Mike doesn’t follow Christ. Jesus said love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you. Christ’s advocation of peace and nonviolence spans four Gospel accounts. Is it possible Mike missed this instruction during Sunday school?
Mike Pompeo is a self-professed Christian of the Zionist strain. The Christian Zionists believe Christ will return and establish the Kingdom of God, and this will only be possible after Israel declares a state on stolen land gained through violence and ethnic cleansing.
Israel’s daily demonstrated racism and violence gets a free pass because the Christian Zionists in America believe any criticism of the Jewish state is criticism of God. Instead of citing Jesus, they turn back to the Old Testament and the blessing of Isaac in Genesis—“Those who curse you will be cursed, and those who bless you will be blessed.”
The Palestinians are cursed for the sin of having lived on the land for centuries. Iran is cursed because it dares defend itself against US-Israeli sabotage, assassination, and terrorism. Lebanon is cursed because it is home to Hezbollah, the Lebanese political party that began as organized resistance to Israeli invasions. Syria is cursed because it defends its national sovereignty and decries the Israeli theft of its Golan Heights.
For Christian Zionists like Mike Pompeo, the New Testament is something that either must be ignored—or selectively read and interpreted—and Christ’s promise of world peace must be shelved until the work of killing Palestinians, Syrians, and Iranians is complete. Mike isn’t a normal Christian, he’s a Judaic-Christian, a Christian neocon.
“Christians are not political Zionists,” writes Tom Usher . “Real Christians can’t stand the political Zionism of Herzl and Jabotinsky and the various terrorists who brought this anti-Jacob state called Israel into being.”
Pompeo is preaching to the choir and rallying the troops to fight the next Israeli war, this time targeting Iran. The US has already assisted in the “Greater Israel” effort to undermine and destroy all those who oppose Jewish racism and nationalism.
Iran is not targeted because it poses a threat to Israel. It is targeted because it dares to speak truth to Israeli crimes and has built defenses against the endless violence of the Zionist state.
Mike Pompeo will work toward this end—the destruction of Iran. He will strive to accomplish the work of destroying Syria. This is the long-standing neocon agenda. Destroy the enemies of Zionism and Jewish supremacy. Ethnically cleanse Gaza and the West Bank—the latter now in motion due to the efforts of the Kahanist Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) Party, an unabashedly racist offshoot of the Likud Party that will likely be included in next Israeli coalition government.
Yes, as Pompeo declares in his tweet, his “belief in [a distorted and perverse] Jesus makes a real difference,” not for peace, but for endless war stretching from Iran and Syria to Venezuela and beyond.

More than 40 US Organizations Pressure US Congress: End Trump’s Crusade for War in Venezuela,www.therussophile.org,J.C.,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/more-than-40-us-organizations-pressure-us-congress-end-trumps-crusade-for-war-in-venezuela.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

More than 40 organizations from around the United States are demanding their Congress put an end to U.S. intervention in Venezuela saying that, in particular, the illegal and “extensive economic sanctions, imposed unilaterally by the Trump government since August 2017, have caused great hardship and loss of life” in the South American country.
The organizations, including Codepink, and dozens of other civil and religious society organizations, sent a letter to Congress Monday asking for them to encourage peaceful dialogue within Venezuela and to denounce the U.S. Republican administration’s dangerous economic sanctions and threats of military action in Venezuela.
“These threats are absolutely unacceptable, particularly towards a country that does not represent a threat to the United States,” said the authors of the letter that include Demand Progress, Peace Action, Sisters of Mercy Justice Team, American Friends Service Committee, Vote Vets, Common Defense, Alliance Americas, and CASA of Maryland, among others.
President Trump has gone so far as to say that Venezuela is the “country with which we should go to war, they have all that oil and they are right in our backyard.”
The letter was delivered to all Congressional elected officials Tuesday morning.
“The pressure from these grassroots organizations could not come at a more critical time for Venezuela,” said Alex Main , Director of International Policy for Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR).
Main pointed out:
“The latest round of sanctions launched in January is worsening the current crisis and generating more suffering as it slows down imports, including food and medicines, and blocks the roads allowing economic recovery.”
So far, U.S. President Donald Trump and his hawkish advisors, including John Bolton and Elliot Abrams who have led the U.S. into drawn out and illegal wars under previous presidencies, have enacted over 20 sanctions against the Venezuelan government and individuals in the country in order to bring down the democratically-elected Nicolas Maduro presidency.
Hassan El-Tayyab , Co-Director of Just Foreign Policy , which organized the petition told CEPR:
“There is really no military solution to the crisis in Venezuela and more than 40 groups believe that our best chance to achieve peace is through dialogue, the lifting of sanctions and the total elimination of unauthorized war.”
Just Foreign Policy helped to pass legislation in December to end the U.S.’s congressionally unauthorized involvement in the war on impoverished Yemen.
The complete letter follows:
Dear (member of Congress),
We, the undersigned groups, wish to express our deep concern regarding the dangerous and destructive strategy of regime change directed at Venezuela by the Trump Government. The extensive economic sanctions imposed unilaterally by the US Government since August 2017 have caused great difficulties and loss of life for many Venezuelans.
The latest round of sanctions announced in January is expected to worsen the current crisis and cause even greater human suffering across the country. Although many onlookers have noted that civil war is an increasingly likely possibility, Trump government officials are strongly opposed to peaceful dialogue between the country’s political representatives, and have openly threatened military intervention.
We ask you to take a firm and public stand against these immoral, reckless and illegal policies, and to support efforts to promote a peaceful dialogue, before it is too late.
We urge you to: Oppose economic sanctions: Although the mismanagement of the Government and the fall in world oil prices are the causes of much of the deep crisis in Venezuela, the economic sanctions of the U.S. Government – both the financial sanctions of August 2017, like the sanctions of January 2019 to the Venezuelan oil industry – are generating additional losses of billions of dollars of foreign currency needed for essential imports, according to experts and even U.S. officials, as National Security Advisor, John Bolton. In the current context, these sanctions will inevitably lead to greater human suffering, including many deaths due to lack of medicines and other essential imports. Unilateral economic sanctions are illegal under the U.N. Charter and the Charter of the OAS; and research shows that they are generally ineffective in achieving the desired political results. Oppose threats of military intervention : President Trump has advocated military intervention in Venezuela since the beginning of 2017, while he and other government officials have declared repeatedly that “all options are on the table” with Venezuela.
These threats are absolutely unacceptable, particularly towards a country that does not represent a threat to the United States, and only the immense political polarization in Venezuela is increasing. Members of Congress must strongly denounce these threats and make the adoption of the “Law for the Prohibition of Unauthorized Military Action in Venezuela” one of the top priorities, and they must also commit to that, in case President Trump and his Government to involve the military in any action directed at Venezuela, will invoke the War Powers Resolution of 1973 and, consequently, will give rise to a debate and a vote in Congress to end any unauthorized use of force. Support for dialogue : Members of the US Executive have rejected the possibility of dialogue and, instead, have pressed for an immediate regime change in Venezuela, asking the Venezuelan Armed Forces to rebel against the Maduro Government. Experts have warned that this strategy could trigger a division within the Armed Forces of the country, with a potentially violent and catastrophic result. Members of Congress must oppose this dangerous zero-sum game led by the White House, and advocate for peaceful dialogue. The Vatican, the Secretary General of the U.N., Mexico and Uruguay have offered to help mediate in the dialogue and political negotiations to resolve the current crisis in a peaceful manner. Congress should support these efforts.
With the recent appointment as special envoy to Venezuela of the veteran American advisor and condemned by the Iran-Contra scandal, Elliott Abrams, and with the increasingly aggressive rhetoric of the White House, his support could not come at a more crucial moment. There is no moral, legal or political justification for this collective punishment against the Venezuelan population, based on economic sanctions. There is no solution that is military; Venezuela’s crisis must be resolved through dialogue and negotiations. Therefore, Congress must insist on eliminating destructive economic sanctions and removing any possibility of an unauthorized war from the board.

Theresa May just kicked the Brexit can right into Corbyn’s allotment (by George Galloway),www.therussophile.org,VT Editors,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/theresa-may-just-kicked-the-brexit-can-right-into-corbyns-allotment-by-george-galloway.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

George Galloway was a member of the British Parliament for nearly 30 years. He presents TV and radio shows (including on RT). He is a film-maker, writer and a renowned orator.
As Inspector Clouseau once said in the Pink Panther “It’s so obvious that it could not possibly be a trap.”
Delivered in a Peter Sellers type of French accent with his gormless naivety it was perfectly obvious to the cinema audiences that a trap was exactly what it was.
Theresa May’s 11th-hour 55th minute conversion to consulting Jeremy Corbyn on the type of Brexit Britain should finally enjoy is so obvious it must be a trap.
Not that Corbyn had any choice but to accept the prime minister’s invitation to negotiate with her in the name of “ national unity .” Britain IS in a jam, but not one of the famously horticultural allotment-tending leader of the opposition’s making. Just days away from the bumpy exit which, even its supporters (like me), cannot deny a WTO departure from the European Union would be, a terror (no exaggeration). Having to hold European Parliamentary elections (in which I would be a candidate), the Brexit camp would sweep with a huge majority, adding a new complication to the prime minister (and the leader of the opposition’s) pickle. This, and an increasingly belligerent Brussels elite shrilly insulting us, something had to be done.
ALSO ON RT.COM Wales Minister Nigel Adams resigns over UK PM’s promise to hold Brexit talks with Jeremy Corbyn The most obvious way to “ break the logjam ” in a Remain dominated parliament determined to frustrate both the PM and the Referendum result would be a new general election. That nobody in power or the power’s chorus-line in the national media is demanding one is the hidden secret in this affair.
They cannot hold a general election because, in all likelihood, the man they have traduced for four long years as a “ Marxist ,” a “ communist, ” a “ Czech spy, ” a “ Russian agent ,” and a “ Putin apologist ,” would likely win it.
This, despite a tsunami of bad press of unprecedented ferocity, not a few blunders by Corbyn himself, and chasm opening up to the right of both major parties which nationalist and even fascist street gangs are busily exploiting over the perceived failure of both parties to deliver the Brexit 17.4 million people voted for.
Only months ago, both Tory and Labour were regularly polling above 40 percent in opinion polls and neck and neck. Today, they are still neck and neck but both are down in the low 30 percent .
Theresa May has kicked the can into Corbyn’s allotment alright, the question is if he picks it up, will he be left carrying the can?
Corbyn will seek to negotiate a “ softer Brexit ” with the PM. But millions of people think the PM’s Brexit is already way too soft. Equally millions of people don’t want a Brexit at all, and they were already blaming Corbyn (widely suspected to be a Brexiteer at heart) just as much as they were blaming the government for the fact we were leaving the EU at all. Force a softer Brexit and alienate the 5 million Labour voters who chose Brexit without getting much (if any at all) credit from the ardent Remainers. That, fo6r Mr Corbyn, is the question.
ALSO ON RT.COM Corbyn says he’s ‘very happy’ to meet May to hammer out Brexit plan, others not so sure And all of this has to be completed this week!
One Independence Day, as the sun rose on the Britain which had just voted to leave the EU and join the world, in a video which can still be viewed on YouTube, I stood on my roof and to camera, called for the government (at that hour still led by David Cameron – remember him?) to bring Jeremy Corbyn in immediately to a national negotiating team, to bring the Brexit ship into harbour. It was the right advice then. I’m not at all sure it is the best advice now…
If all this is risky for Corbyn, it has the potential to break the Conservative party in two. This morning, the backlash has begun within the Conservatives with the resignation of a hitherto obscure minister at the Welsh Office – in Tory terms the equivalent of the Soviet-era power station in Ulan Bator. Most of the Tory big beasts long ago resigned from the cabinet. Only the numbers can tell now – if, in the course of the day, ministers begin quitting in numbers Mrs May is done.

Editor’s note: Mueller’s personal silence is the strangest thing unless he is working through surrogates who have leaked the contradictions between the fake Barr version and the real report…
The real one, we are told, sets out a long series of criminal cases against Donald Trump.
http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/william-barr-cover-up-mueller-report-trump-obstruction-russia.html Last evening, the Wall Street Journal editorialized that reporters and House Democrats were smearing Attorney General William Barr by implying that his summary of the Mueller report was anything other than completely faithful and representative. The Journal sneered at “the impression, abetted by a press corps that was fully invested in the collusion story, that Mr. Barr is somehow lying about Mr. Mueller’s real conclusions.” This was “preposterous,” the editorial explained, because Barr “surely understood on releasing the summary of conclusions last week that he would be open to contradiction by Mr. Mueller if he took such liberties.” The editorial was published at 7:24 p.m. Minutes before, and probably too late to make any alterations, the New York Times broke the news that Barr was in fact contradicted. How could anybody think Barr would be stupid enough to lie when Mueller could expose him , asks the Journal, at almost literally the precise moment when Mueller’s team exposes Barr for lying. The Times reports that Mueller’s famously leak-free team was moved to break its silence by Barr’s slanted summary of its work. The news from the Times , as well as the follow-up report from the Washington Post , conveys very little information about the substance of the report. It does seem clear, though, that Barr has not been dealing from the top of the deck.

BREAKING NEWS: LIBYA EXPLODING IN MILITARY ACTION – TRIPOLI TO BE ATTACKED WITHIN 24 HOURS,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/breaking-news-libya-exploding-in-military-action-tripoli-to-be-attacked-within-24-hours.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
This report combines public info and COVERT INTEL which is for subscribers only — Tonight, 04 April 2019, Libya is exploding in military violence. Invasion of its Capital is likely within 24 hours. Air strikes are being ordered against attacking troops and the situation is now completely out of control.
Muammar Gaddafi former leader of Lybia, was overthrown, captured and killed on October 20, 2011.
The destruction of his government came after internal power struggles against his 42 year rein, through tribal warfare which began in earnest in 2009 and wrecked the country. As the tumult raged, there were accusation that Qadaffi was using his military to attack and kill civilians, which brought a military response from . . . NATO.
At the time, many say Qadaffi was planning to create a GOLD-BACKED CURRENCY for all of Africa, and the Bankers of the west, fearing a gold-backed currency would wipe out their worthless “fiat” currencies, unleashed NATO attacks to topple Qadaffi.
Unable to defend himself or his country from such firepower, Qadaffi fled but was ultimately found and killed in the streets by mobs.
After his overthrow, clashes for power continued, but through the United Nations a “Government of National Accord (GNA) took over and was recognized (by the UN) as the only legitimate political rule for the country. It was formed under the terms of the Libyan Political Agreement, a United Nations-led initiative, signed on 17 December 2015. The agreement has been unanimously endorsed by the United Nations Security Council which has welcomed the formation of a Presidency Council for Libya and recognized that the Government of National Accord is the sole legitimate executive authority in Libya.
On 31 December 2015, Chairman of the Libyan House of Representatives, Aguila Saleh Issa declared his support for the Libyan Political Agreement. Ever since, the General National Congress has criticized the unity government on multiple fronts as biased in favor of its rivals, the House of Representatives.
The Government of National Accord has 17 ministers and is led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. The first meeting of the cabinet of the Government of National Accord took place on 2 January 2016 in Tunis. A full cabinet consisting of 18 ministers was announced in January 2016.
The Prime Minister of the GNA, Fayez al-Sarraj, and six other members of the Presidential Council and proposed cabinet arrived in Tripoli on 30 March 2016. The following day, it was reported that the GNA has taken control of the prime ministerial offices.
Since March 2016, conflict between the two rival governments, the Libyan House of Representatives and the General National Congress (GNC), has intensified. Despite previously supporting it, the Libyan House of Representatives withdrew its recognition of the GNA by voting against it in the summer of 2016 and becoming their rival for governing the country. Despite being backed by only parts of the GNC and without formal approval from the Libyan House of Representatives, who have called for new elections to be held by February 2018, the GNA is still recognized by the United Nations as Libya’s legitimate government.
The GNA has struggled to assert its authority and has been largely unsuccessful in unifying Libya as expected. The ultimate viability of the Government of National Accord was always uncertain given that the country still remains greatly divided across political, tribal and ideological lines.
ENTER Khalifa Haftar
Field Marshal Khalifa Belqasim Haftar is a Libyan military officer and the head of the Libyan National Army (LNA), currently engaged in a Second Libyan Civil War. On 2 March 2015, he was appointed commander of the armed forces loyal to the elected legislative body, the Libyan House of Representatives.
Haftar was born in the Libyan city of Ajdabiya. He served in the Libyan army under Muammar Gaddafi, and took part in the coup that brought Gaddafi to power in 1969. He took part in the Libyan contingent against Israel in the Yom Kippur Warof 1973. In 1987, he became a prisoner of war during the war against Chad after being lulled into a trap and captured, then a major embarrassment for Gaddafi and represented a major blow to Gaddafi’s ambitions in Chad. While held prisoner, he and his fellow officers formed a group hoping to overthrow Gaddafi. He was released around 1990 in a deal with the United States government and spent nearly two decades in Langley, Virginia in the US, gaining U.S. citizenship. In 1993, while living in the United States, he was convicted in absentia of crimes against the Jamahiriya and sentenced to death.
Haftar held a senior position in the forces which overthrew Gaddafi in the 2011 Libyan Civil War. In 2014 he was commander of the Libyan Army when the General National Congress (GNC) refused to give up power in accordance with its term of office. Haftar launched a campaign against the GNC and its Islamic fundamentalist allies. His campaign allowed elections to take place to replace the GNC, but then developed into a civil war.
Haftar has been described as “Libya’s most potent warlord,” having fought “with and against nearly every significant faction” in Libya’s conflicts, and as having a “reputation for unrivalled military experience.”
CHAIN REACTION
In Libya since the fall of Muammar al-Qaddafi, years often pass without much change as political deadlock continues and the economy decays. Then a moment of opportunism triggers a chain reaction. One such chain reaction has taken place this year, begun by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar’s military advance into southern Libya and seizure of key oil fields. This step seems likely to result in the fulfillment of the warlord’s long-held—and increasingly internationally supported—desire to control all of Libya.
After Haftar re-emerged from his long-term exile in suburban Virginia, political competition between Islamists, Qaddafi-loyalist technocrats, ex-regime associates, and those persecuted by the regime combined with a patchwork of local conflicts and the rise of jihadi groups to spark a second civil war in 2014. This dynamic caused the politicians to be eclipsed by their armed counterparts—notably, by Haftar himself, as his military operation left militarized administrations in its wake across eastern Libya. Five years on, the country remains torn between the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord, based in Tripoli and headed by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, and the Haftar-backed administration in eastern Libya. The international community has largely stood by, detached from the reality on the ground and trying to create political unity among increasingly marginalized politicians.
In 2019, the spread of Haftar’s self-declared Libyan National Army (LNA) through southern Libya has been surprisingly rapid. Under a media campaign promoting the operation as an effort to expel foreign forces and terrorists from southern Libya, the LNA (which uses foreign militias) moved quickly in February to secure Libya’s el-Sharara and el-Feel oil fields, which together produce close to 400,000 barrels per day. Just as he did when he won control of eastern Libya’s oil facilities in September 2016, Haftar subsumed strategically placed local forces (including those guarding the oil fields) into the LNA with the promise of a uniform and a salary.
Perhaps most revealing was the accompanying distribution of a parallel Libyan currency (which Russia has supplied in order to keep Haftar and eastern Libya’s parallel government liquid over the last few years) along with flour, gas, and petroleum to the long-neglected local population. Haftar’s seizure of the oil fields advertises to Libya’s general populace that he can supply what Tripoli’s feckless Government of National Accord cannot.
This recent move south was bold and significant. But this operation—slick as it was—will not be sufficient to break the status quo. Haftar has held the majority of Libya’s oil production since 2016, not to mention his de facto control of Libya’s elected legislature and its self-appointed government, which has been administering the east in opposition to the Government of National Accord in Tripoli (which was itself created by the Libyan Political Agreement).
But Haftar has failed to translate his factual control on the ground into real political currency—namely, a leadership position in the internationally recognized government. His attempt to independently sell oil in June 2018, which could have been a game changer, was met with concerted international resistance that ultimately forced him to back down. Since that blunt power grab was stifled, Haftar and his backers have made a subtler attempt at generating influence where it matters, amongst Tripoli’s de facto power holders and the international community driving Libya’s political process.
This year’s diplomatic efforts have focused on manufacturing a deal between Haftar and the Government of National Accord’s Sarraj—essentially sidelining Libya’s two legislative houses in a track aimed at formalizing Haftar’s national role. It was only once these negotiations stalled that Haftar and the LNA made good on a long-standing threat to launch the southern operation, which was toasted in the United Arab Emirates, one of Haftar’s main supporters. This was quickly followed by a fresh round of diplomacy. First the chairman of Libya’s National Oil Corporation was convinced to lift force majeure on the captured southern oil fields, essentially ceding control to Haftar in a recognition of his invasion as an “extraordinary event,” thus legitimizing Haftar’s presence there and cementing his control over Libya’s oil. In late February, Sarraj and Haftar were brought together by the United Arab Emirates and the United Nations special envoy to Libya for fresh negotiations aimed at finalizing a political deal—now with Haftar bringing even more weight to the table. But Haftar still left Abu Dhabi without anything solid, suggesting that Sarraj did what he does best, stalling negotiations in an attempt to buy time. He is, however, negotiating with an increasingly weak hand.
Haftar now realistically has two ways of exchanging his recent gains for an official seat at the table: an official deal or a military imposition of the new de facto reality. He has chosen a military solution.
MILITARY ON THE MOVE
At about 8:00 AM eastern US time today, Haftar ordered his forces to advance on Libya’s capital, Tripoli. Those forces began advancing immediately.
At about 11:00 AM eastern US time today, UN’s secretary general expressed concern about a possible major armed showdown over Libya’s capital. Comes as forces loyal to the army commander took control overnight of a town near Tripoli.
Libya’s currency fell 7% today in response to Haftar forces moving towards Tripoli, in defiance of UN calls and on the day the Secretary General arrives in that city!
Upon his arrival, the Secretary General of the UN tweeted: I am deeply shocked and moved by the suffering and despair I have seen in the detention centre in Tripoli, where migrants and refugees are in detention for unlimited time and without any hope to regain their lives. pic.twitter.com/7oM1IhojlX

UN STATEMENT
The text of the following statement on Libya was released by the Governments of France, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Begin Text:
The governments of France, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States are deeply concerned by fighting near Gharyan, Libya and urge all parties to immediately de-escalate tensions, which are hindering prospects for UN political mediation. At this sensitive moment in Libya’s transition, military posturing and threats of unilateral action only risk propelling Libya back toward chaos. We strongly believe that there is no military solution to the Libya conflict. Our governments oppose any military action in Libya and will hold accountable any Libyan faction that precipitates further civil conflict.
We stand united behind UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) Ghassan Salame as the UN seeks to break Libya’s political deadlock, improve transitional governance, and chart a path toward credible and peaceful elections. All Libyan actors should work constructively with SRSG Salame as the UN finalizes plans for the national conference planned for April 14–16.
ATTACK ORDER GIVEN BY GNA
At about Noon, Eastern US time today, the Prime Minister of the Government of National Accord (GNA) issued orders to “launch air strikes against all forces targeting Tripoli.”
At about 2:00 PM eastern US time today, clashes began on the outskirts of Tripoli, about 50km from the center of the Capital itself.
Just before 3:00 PM eastern US time today, it was officially announced that “Al-Zahra, ‘Aziziya, Highway 28 and Highway 17 officially under the LNA control”
At a distance of just 40km from the capital, Haftar’s forces have seized a major entry way into Tripoli.
At about 3:30 PM eastern US time today, General Mabrouk Sahban of the LNA warned all airports against allowing jets targeting his forces from launching, “or else they will be bombed immediately by the Airforce.”
At about 4:00 PM Eastern US time today, the EU Delegation to Libya Tweeted a statement: Joint EU local statement on the situation in Libya #European_Union #EU #Libya pic.twitter.com/w1X0RLcwjZ
— EU DEL to LIBYA (@EUDELtoLibya) April 4, 2019
At about 4:30 PM eastern US time today, Britain called for a closed-door UN Security Council meeting on Libya.
The council is expected to hold a closed-door meeting on Friday (tomorrow).
By about 5:45 PM eastern US time today, Pro-Haftar forces were within 30 kilometers of Tripoli, according to a report by AFP which cited a military source.

RT.comHaving drastically increased the Pentagon budget and demanded more spending by NATO, US President Donald Trump is now seriously (?) complaining that all that money could be better spent elsewhere.
Trump lamented the levels of US, Chinese and Russian military spending at a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House on Thursday, part of the ongoing talks to resolve the trade war between Washington and Beijing.
“As you know China is spending a lot of money on military, so are we, so is Russia and those three countries I think can come together and stop the spending and spend on things that maybe are more productive toward long-term peace,” Trump said.
I think it’s much better if we all got together and we didn’t make these weapons.
Such a proposal is indeed rich, coming from a president who raised the Pentagon budget to over $700 billion his first year in office, and hopes for a $718 billion or more in 2020 – more than the next 12 countries combined.
Trump has repeatedly hammered NATO allies over their reluctance to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on their military, including purchases of US weapons systems. He also reportedly pushed for allies to pay the full cost of US troops based on their territory, as well as an additional percentage based on whether their policies “align closely” with Washington.
China’s 2019 military budget was estimated at $224 billion, and Russia’s was far more modest at $44 billion. Meanwhile, the US national debt has surpassed $22 trillion and is continuing to rise.

The Man Who Pushed Russiagate Because the Best Defense is a Strong Offense,www.therussophile.org,State of the Nation,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-man-who-pushed-russiagate-because-the-best-defense-is-a-strong-offense.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
By Monica Crowley
ANALYSIS/OPINION:
The best defense, the saying goes, is a good offense.
The key orchestrators of the Big Trump-Russia Collusion Lie seem to have hewed tightly to that tactical advice.
Over the past two years, one of their biggest “tells” has been their hyper-aggressive and gratuitous attacks on the president. Given that special counsel Robert Mueller ’s investigation found no collusion or obstruction of justice, their constant broadsides now look, in retrospect, like calculated pre-emptive strikes to deflect attention and culpability away from themselves.
By accusing Mr. Trump of what they themselves were guilty of, they created a masterful distraction through projection.
With Mr. Mueller ’s findings, Mr. Comey ’s and Mr. McCabe’s media benders look increasingly suspicious.
As do those of their comrades in the Obama national security apparatus, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and his partner in possible crime, former CIA Director John Brennan , who, apart from former President Barack Obama himself, may be the biggest player of them all.
Any investigation into the origins and execution of the Big Lie must focus on Mr. Brennan , whose job as the nation’s chief spook would have prohibited him, by law, from engaging in any domestic political spy games.
Of course, the law didn’t stop him from illegally spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee by hacking into its computers and lying repeatedly about it, prompting Democratic senators to call for his resignation.
Once out of Langley, Mr. Brennan tore into Mr. Trump, accusing him of “treason” (among other crimes) in countless television appearances and bitter tweets. It got so vicious that Mr. Trump pulled his security clearance.
Consider a few critical data points.
The Obama Department of Justice and FBI targeting of two low-level Trump aides, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, was carried out in the spring of 2016 because they wanted to spy on the Trump campaign but needed a way in. They enlisted an American academic and shadowy FBI informant named Stefan Halper to repeatedly sidle up to both Mr. Papadopoulos and Mr. Page. But complementing his work for the FBI , Mr. Halper had a side gig as an intelligence operative with longstanding ties to the CIA and British intelligence MI6.
Another foreign professor, Joseph Mifsud, who played an important early part in targeting Papadopoulos, also had abiding ties to the CIA , MI6 and the British foreign secretary.
A third operative, Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, targeted Mr. Papadopoulos in a London bar. It was Mr. Downer’s “tip” to the FBI that provided the justification for the start of Russia counterintelligence investigation, complete with fraudulently-obtained FISA warrants to spy on the Trump campaign.
All of these interactions reek of entrapment. Mr. Papadopoulos now says, “I believe Australian and UK intelligence were involved in an active operation to target Trump and his associates.” Like Mr. Halper and Mr. Mifsud, Mr. Downer had ties to the CIA , MI6 and (surprise!) the Clintons.
Given the deep intelligence backgrounds of these folks, it’s difficult to believe that former DOJ/ FBI officials such as Peter Strzok or even James Comey and Andrew McCabe on their own devised the plan to deploy them.
So: who did? How did the relationships with Messrs. Halper, Mifsud and Downer come about? Who suggested them for these tasks? To whom did they report? How were they compensated?
Any investigation must follow the money — and the personnel. There were plenty of DOJ/ FBI officials involved, but what about intelligence officials? Was Mr. Brennan a central player in the hoax, which would help explain the participation of Mr. Halper, Mr. Mifsud and Mr. Downer? Intel officials are likely to draw on other intelligence operatives.
There is also a glimpse of a paper trail. Fox News’ Catherine Herridge reported last week that “in a Dec. 12, 2016 text, [ FBI lawyer Lisa] Page wrote to McCabe: “Btw, Clapper told Pete that he was meeting with Brennan and Cohen for dinner tonight. Just FYSA [for your situational awareness].”
“Within a minute, McCabe replied, “OK.” Ms. Herridge notes that those named are likely Peter Strzok and Mr. Brennan ’s then-deputy, David Cohen. Ms. Herridge also notes that while we don’t yet know what was discussed during the dinner, government sources thought it “irregular” for Mr. Clapper to be in contact with the more junior-level Mr. Strzok. She also points out that the text came “during a critical time for the Russia probe.”
Indeed. It was right before the publication of the ICA, the official Intelligence Community Assessment of Russian 2016 election interference.
As Paul Sperry has reported, “A source close to the House investigation said Brennan himself selected the CIA and FBI analysts who worked on the ICA, and that they included former FBI counterespionage chief Peter Strzok.
“Strzok was the intermediary between Brennan and Comey , and he was one of the authors of the ICA,” according to the source.” Recall that the dossier-based ICA was briefed to Obama , Trump and Congress ahead of Trump’s inauguration.
Post- Mueller report, Mr. Brennan is spinning wildly that perhaps his early condemnations of Mr. Trump were based on “bad information.”
These are just some of the threads suggesting Mr. Brennan may be one of the Masters of the Big Lie, requiring full investigation.
If the devil is in the details, Mr. Brennan is all over the details.
No wonder he — and his fellow caballers — have been so loud. They doth protest too much.

"The Delusional Futurism Of ‘Liberal World Order’ Academics, by Brandon Smith",www.therussophile.org,Robert Gore,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-delusional-futurism-of-liberal-world-order-academics-by-brandon-smith.html/,"This post was originally published on this site https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/805203347f71b4a9606694b65ac317ee?s=96&d=identicon&r=G
Academics with no common sense or real world experience continue to tell us how smart they are and preach to us about our shortcomings and their “solutions.” From Brandons Smith at alt-market.com : Perhaps this is an overly broad generalization, but I feel there is an almost universal feeling among the public that there is something intrinsically annoying about academia. The source of this annoyance is up for debate, but I believe it stems from the image academics project versus the reality of their personal character and intent. Your average university approved academic will say that some people find them distasteful because they are “so smart”, and this makes others envious. I would say it’s the opposite – the average academic is actually quite ignorant, but brandishes a false image of being a genius. This is why I often refer to them as “academic idiots”.
Fake intelligence and faux wisdom are like sandpaper to people’s exposed nerves, and the average person is not as dumb as academics think they are.
At the top of the fraudulent academic totem pole are what I would call the “academic philosophers”; the gatekeepers, the people who pontificate regularly on the meaning of life and society while living the most charmed life one can imagine. These are people who in most cases come from upper class backgrounds. They have been provided for every waking moment of their existence. They have had every door opened for them by someone else on the path to success, and have experienced little to no struggle or suffering in the whole of their time on this Earth. And yet, they somehow deem themselves expertly qualified to comment on the human condition.
It should come as no surprise that the ideas these academics develop tend to deny concrete reality. They seek to pursue agendas that are fanciful at best and would be ultimately destructive if ever applied in the real world.
I find this to be common with many philosophers, not just today but throughout history. The venerated Plato was such a person; the youngest son of wealthy aristocratic parents who was required to do very little in early life but ponder. The trials surrounding his friend Socrates aside, Plato never abandoned the notion of elitist rule over society. Plato’s Republic is a shrine to the elitist model, imagining a world governed essentially by academics – People born with superior intellectual abilities and who were destined to rule over the rest of us as benevolent demigods.
It’s a funny coincidence that supposedly objective elitist academics always come to the conclusion that THEY are the best equipped people to manage society.
The academic cabal is not entirely naive, however. They have realized over time that their sales pitch of an intellectual priest class and Utopian pyramid schemes are not very effective, and they have opted to switch narratives. The new narrative is one of inevitability; the inevitability of socialism, the inevitability of globalism and the inevitability of algorithmic automation.
In other words, globalism will be the apex social structure and artificial intelligence will govern the daily machinations of that structure, regardless of what the public wants. The elites won’t rule the world directly, but their ilk will create the algorithms and the policies that will rule the world by virtue of social and technological evolution. Like Jean-Luc Godard’s French New Wave film, Alphaville, the idea is that the elites can simply sit back and let the dark “logic” of algorithmic governance do the dirty work. For, after all, how can we possibly argue with a computer?
An example of one of the academic elitists of which I speak is Yuval Noah Harari. His editorials are getting a lot of play in the mainstream media lately and they focus on the necessity of globalism as well as the need for humans to quickly adapt to technocracy lest they find themselves obsolete. Harari is a prototypical academic philosopher, regurgitating old concepts of aristocracy and feudalism thinly veiled in futurist imagery. His arguments are the type that other lesser academics absorb and endlessly parrot as if they are profound.
For those not familiar with the ideas behind futurism, I suggest reading my article ‘The Meaning Of Good And Evil In Perilous Times’ . To summarize, futurists consistently endorse the notion that old methodologies must be erased to make way for new methodologies. Traditions and ideals of the past are considered a prison which holds humanity back from progress and a better tomorrow. They believe that the solution to the imbalances and tragedies of today is to aggressively dismantle the existing system and rebuild it in a new and original way. This includes morals and guiding principles, which they see as stifling and relative.
Futurism was founded in the early 20 th century in Europe with sister groups in Russia and is considered a precursor to early socialist movements including fascism and communism. To clarify, there are no new ideas under the sun, only old ideas with a slightly different spin. Socialism precedes globalism, which is one of the oldest ideas; the idea of total empire.
Like most modern academic philosophers, Yuval Harari displays futurism and globalism in spades. He is associated with the globalist Carnegie Council For Ethics In International Affairs. Once known as the Church Peace Union, the group helped push Woodrow Wilson into involving the US in WWI and also helped promote the establishment of the UN.
He is an adequate model for my debunking of what these people often refer to as the “liberal world order”, which is just another brand of futurism. As a reference point I am using two of Harari’s articles, one published for the Guardian on the future of automation and the robots displacing humanity, and the other published for the Rothschild owned magazine The Economist on the need for globalism and the end of nationalism. I will be summarizing his arguments and views, but I welcome readers to examine his articles linked above.
Let’s get to it…
AI Will Replace Most Humans…And This Is A Good Thing
This is becoming a mainstay narrative from the globalist establishment and their academia for a number of reasons. The argument that AI dominance is an inevitability is much like the argument that globalism is an inevitability; both are based on self fulfilling prophecy.
Harari imagines what he calls a “world without work”, a development only 20-30 years in the future in which algorithmic machines replace human beings as the primary source of labor. There are two sides to this piece of propaganda; first it is meant to frighten the public into demanding centralization and global governance. Harari asserts that without global governance and a “universal basic income”, AI will make most people without technological savvy into instant paupers, which he labels “the useless class”. And here we see the trick.
As I outlined in my article ‘The Real Reason Why Globalists Are So Obsessed With Artificial Intelligence’ , globalist entities like DARPA, the UN and the World Economic Forum have been highly aggressive in pushing AI to the forefront of the mainstream and have engaged in promotional campaigns to counter public distrust of the technology. At the same time, these globalist organizations have been arguing that without their increased oversight, AI could be abused by nation states or could destroy whole economies.
So, globalists tell you that AI dominance is an inevitable consequence of progress while they expend vast sums of capital and man-hours to make their prediction a reality. They then tell you AI will be a threat to your livelihood and your children’s livelihoods. Then, they tell you that the only answer is to give them more power to regulate the problem that they created.
The second part of this propaganda is the claim that the dangers of AI could be turned into Utopian benefits. If the “world without work” is the stick, then universal basic income is the carrot. The fantasy promise of the futurists goes back to the early days of communism, and always includes a tomorrow-land where all people will live a leisurely existence; a society where all necessities are provided without labor. Usually flying cars and floating cities are offered in there somewhere….
Harrari insinuates in his article for The Guardian that sloth is a natural state for most of mankind, and that the majority of people would remain mentally comfortable with having no purpose in life as long as they were given a virtual existence as a means of distraction. He cites the example of basement dwelling adult-children that, if allowed, subsist on their parent’s generosity and a life in video games. But rather than pointing out that it is destructive to encourage such behavior, Hariri suggests that it should be a mainstay of our society.
What Hariri ignores is a key issue in why many people settle for such a life. It is not necessarily because they enjoy being part of the “useless class”; many of them desperately want to find a sense of purpose and accomplishment as this desire is ingrained in the psyche of most people at birth. It’s just that they have no idea how, and have lived in an environment that seems increasingly designed to impair their independence.
I would note that elites in aristocracy for centuries exploited the crutch of universal basic income as a means to control the behavior of their children. The progeny of elites were often treated as property, and were kept in line through infantilization and income dependence. For these children, following a personal dream or setting out on one’s own was almost unthinkable because they had been isolated from any and all practical skill sets. To walk away from the system was to invite poverty and potential death.
So the plan is this: Prevent people from becoming self reliant, ensure you are their only source of income, then lord over them using that income as if they owe you like a child owes a parent. Hariri is calling for this kind of control measure for the entire world.
Human Experience Is All In Our Heads And Means Nothing
Much like Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, Hariri’s “world without work” relies on opiates, but in this case, the technological opiates of virtual reality. He claims that this is nothing new, and that humans have long participated in virtual reality games through their participation in religion as well as the acquisition of property. I fail to see the logic in his comparison, and it appears that he uses the odd tangent merely as an opportunity to meander into an unoriginal atheistic and socialistic rant.
However, this rant does give us more insight into another globalist propaganda meme, which is that all experience is a matter of perception and that all conclusions are relative, including moral conclusions. I have written dozens of articles on the issue of globalism and moral relativism and why it is built on lies and disinformation. I feel it is one of the most vital debates of our era or any era because it determines the survival of our humanity.
For someone who views all experience as a pointless game that people make up to entertain themselves until they eventually die, Hariri sure seems overly concerned with how we are all governed while we LARP our way through existence. If there is no point and there is no design to the universe or humanity, then why seek to centralize control over the game at all?
Of course, this is elitist nonsense, and I’m not sure that they even believe the garbage that they are selling. As I’ve noted in past articles, numerous scholars have presented considerable evidence of inherent human psychological qualities, including inborn conscience and moral compass, as well as archetypal dualities which give us the inherent gift of choice. From Carl Jung, to Joseph Campbell to Steven Pinker, etc.., REAL scientists and researchers have undertaken decades of experimentation, data collection and observation to support their conclusions. This is something that academic philosophers like Hariri have no concept of. They think that if they state a viewpoint with enough arrogant bravado this is all they need to solidify it as fact.
The reason why globalists in particular are so fond of the relativism narrative is because in vindicates their behavior in the pursuit of their centralization goals. This behavior is usually based in an “ends justify the means” approach, and is contrary to our inherent voice of empathy and conscience. If human experiences are all a matter of perception and delusion, then how the elites abuse or subjugate other humans to subsidize their own virtual reality no longer matters.
Globalism Good, Nationalism Bad
Global centralization is called many things by elitist academics: The new world order, the multipolar world order, the global reset, the global commons, the liberal world order, etc. Globalists spend most of their time attempting to repackage the marketing behind globalism to make it more palatable to the masses. This is usually a dishonest process because it requires them to falsely attribute the failings of globalism to free markets and nationalism.
Hariri makes a point to proclaim the “liberal world order” a success in improving the planet over several generations economically and geopolitically, but then argues that nation states are beginning to “undermine” that stability. We also constantly hear from globalists that “capitalism” is the cause of most of the world’s ills, yet the truth is socialist-style interference has created corporatism and the oppression of free markets for the past century.
So, globalism saved us from free market capitalism, but capitalism is destroying everything? How can both things be true?
This is the overarching script of the globalists today – That globalism works, nationalism and independent economies don’t, and to take a step backwards is suicide. That is to say, they consider the “populist” movements of today a suicidal step backwards.
What academic elites like Hariri gloss over are the numerous problems our world suffers today because of interdependency and centralization. He proudly observes that any nation that attempts to function outside of the globalist system would fall into economic disarray, but doesn’t acknowledge that in 2008 the world fell into disarray exactly because nations were far too interdependent, with trade mechanism so ingrained that the collapse of one major economy dragged down the next which dragged down the next. This was a cancerous weakness triggered by globalism, not isolationism or nationalism. And, it is a weakness that persists in 2019.
Yet, the solution is always the same – more globalism. The lack of self sufficiency and redundancy in national economies is not something that should be celebrated, but something that should be rectified. It does not have to be that way; globalists made it that way.
Fooling The Masses Into Loving Globalism
As Harari notes in his article for The Economist, creating a “global identity” in which the masses replace loyalty for a nation or tribe with loyalty to their species and to the Earth need not be difficult. All that is required is a common enemy, and what better enemy than the threat of nuclear war, the threat of climate change, and the threat of artificial intelligence?
The use of external threats (some of them fabricated) to herd the public towards an intended mindset is the bread and butter of elites. Man-made climate change stands as a fabricated threat, consistently debunked and the data exposed as rigged to present predetermined findings. AI is a threat which globalists have actively engineered (DARPA being a primary source). The threat of nuclear war has existed for decades and I hardly expect global elites to dismantle such weapons once they get their clutches on global government.
And here we discover the underlying fallacy of Hariri’s debate and the globalist position in general. The elites conjure terrible visions of what will happen if nation states and tribalism are allowed to endure, but the disasters they predict, including war, genetic tampering, weaponization of AI, mass immigration crises, economic collapse – all of these things are being caused by the elites already. And, there would be absolutely nothing stopping them from continuing to cause such problems in the future if they get what they want, which is total global governance.
I fail to see why globalist institutions should be considered more trustworthy than national governments, let alone local tribes. Hariri is an Israeli professor who has obviously benefited from the tribalism of that culture while at the same time admonishing it. Globalists act as though they are loyal to humanity, but they are really only loyal to their own parasitic ideology, and their own tribe – the globalist tribe.
To elevate globalism to something more akin to a religion than just a political philosophy, Hariri pulls one last classic Utopian apparition from his bag of tricks; the promise of godhood. This idea is featured more prominently in his books than in his articles, but it reaffirms the suspicions I discussed in my article ‘Luciferianism: A Secular Look At A Destructive Globalist Belief System’ . Namely, that globalism rests on a foundation very similar to luciferian ideology, and that globalist technocracy is motivated by the obsession of narcissistic sociopaths to become godlike.
They sell this future to the public as a lure, but I’m guessing that the liberal world order will not be gifting the “useless class” with deity status. As in every elitist vision, only the elites get to be rulers and gods. The rest of us get to be cogs in the machine, if we are lucky, and deemed expendable if we are unlucky. Advertisements"

The VIPS gives Trump some advice he ought to take. From the VIPS at consortiumnews.com:
VIPS warn that Trump’s policies regarding Venezuela appear to be on a slippery slope that could take us toward war in Venezuela and military confrontation with Russia. MEMORANDUM FOR: The President
FROM: Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS)
SUBJECT: Avoiding War with Russia over Venezuela
Mr. President:
Your Administration’s policies regarding Venezuela appear to be on a slippery slope that could take us toward war in Venezuela and military confrontation with Russia. As former intelligence officers and other national security practitioners with many decades of experience, we urge you not to let yourself be egged on into taking potentially catastrophic military action in response to civil unrest in Venezuela or Russian activities in the Western Hemisphere. With the recent arrival of two transport aircraft and enduring political support for the government of Venezuela, the Russians are far from crossing any “red line” emanating from the 1823 Monroe Doctrine.
Unfulfilled Objectives in Venezuela
Inside Venezuela, U.S. actions have failed to do more than plunge the country into deeper crisis, cause greater human suffering, and increase the prospects of violence on a national scale. President Maduro’s mishandling of the economy and authoritarian reactions to provocations are impossible to defend, but they result in part from the fact that he has been under siege since he was first elected in 2013 and has faced sanctions aimed ultimately at removing him from office. In our view, the advice you’ve received from your top advisors – Florida Senator Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor John Bolton, Special Representative Elliott Abrams, and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo – was and apparently continues to be wrong. Recognition of Venezuelan National Assembly President Juan Guaidó as “interim president” did not prompt the military to rise up against President Maduro. Neither did attacking the officer corps as merely corrupt opportunists and drug-traffickers enriched through loyalty to former President Chávez and Maduro, nor did repeatedly threatening them with harsher sanctions. Those actions reflected a fundamental misunderstanding about the Venezuelan military, which has never been free of corruption and political compromise but has also never been so totally isolated from the Venezuelan people that it hasn’t felt their suffering. U.S. policies incorrectly assumed that the officers – while probably fed up with Maduro’s shortcomings – would support Guaidó despite his faction’s commitment to dismantle Chavismo , which most officers believe brought historically necessary changes to the country, including enfranchisement of the poor.
Similarly, your Administration’s repeated hints at military intervention have been counterproductive to your regime-change objectives. Your policy and intelligence advisors were correct in interpreting the disparate polling data showing popular support for Guaidó as actually being support for the U.S. to extricate the country from its crisis – the National Assembly President was a political unknown until the United States and others recognized his claim to the Presidency – but your team showed a lack of understanding of Venezuelan nationalism. Venezuelans do not welcome the destruction that would be caused by U.S. military attack; they recall the death toll of Operation Just Cause, when the United States killed more than 3,000 Panamanians (by its own count) to remove one corrupt authoritarian, Manuel Noriega. Threats of invasion have pushed people to circle around Maduro, however reluctantly, not reject him. Your Administration’s strategy of punishing the Venezuelan people, including apparently knocking out their electricity, seems based on the false assumption that humanitarian crisis will prompt a coup to remove Maduro. In fact, the U.S. sanctions have allowed Maduro to shift blame from his own failings to U.S. malice – and it has left Guaidó, whom your advisors portray as the moral equivalent of our Founders, looking like a sell-out to Yankee imperialists at the cost of the Venezuelan people’s health and welfare and magnified civil disorder.
Lost Opportunity for Diplomacy
Senator Rubio, Mr. Bolton, Mr. Abrams, and Mr. Pompeo have also squandered a formidable moment to build on common values with allies in Latin America and Europe. Even though most Latin Americans find your aides’ public assertion that the Monroe Doctrine is alive and well to be insulting, the right-leaning Presidents of most of South and Central America rallied with you to support Guaidó’s self-proclamation. But Guaidó’s lack of leadership – he appears totally scripted by U.S. Government agencies – his inflexibility on negotiations, his open call for U.S. military intervention, and your own Administration’s dangling threat of war are rapidly alienating all but the most subservient to U.S. policy dictates. Negotiation proposals, such as those being developed by the International Contact Group, are gaining momentum.
Internationalizing the Conflict
National Security Advisor Bolton and others have sought to internationalize the Venezuela issue since before Guaidó’s proclamation. Bolton’s reference to a “Troika of Tyranny” in November – which he called “a triangle of terror stretching from Havana to Caracas to Managua” and “sordid cradle of communism in the Western Hemisphere” – was a veiled Cold War-era swipe at Russia and China. Mr. Bolton, Senator Rubio, and other advisors have made clear on numerous occasions that the overthrow of President Maduro would be just the first stage in efforts to eliminate the current governments of the “Troika” and “Communist influence” in the Western Hemisphere. They have repeatedly asserted that Cuban advisors have been crucial to the Maduro government’s survival without providing evidence. Indeed, the reportedly “hundreds” of Venezuelan military defectors, including many managed by U.S. agencies, have not provided even credible hearsay evidence that Cubans are doing more than providing routine assistance. In addition, the threats coming out of Washington have preempted any willingness that Cuba might have had to contribute to a regional solution to the Venezuelan crisis as it has in similar situations, such as Colombia’s recent peace process, the Angola peace process in 1989-90, and the Central American negotiations in the early 1990s.
Provocative Rhetoric about Russia
Most dangerous, however, are aggressive statements about Russia’s engagement with Venezuela. Russian oil companies, particular Rosneft, have long been in Venezuela – bailing out the Venezuelan petroleum company (PDVSA) as its mismanagement and falling oil prices have caused production and revenues to plummet. Most long-term observers believe Rosneft’s decisions, including throwing good money after bad, have been motivated by business calculations, without a particularly ideological objective. Your advisors’ rhetoric imposing an East-West spin on the issue presented President Putin and his advisors an opportunity to try to poke the United States in the eye – especially as Administration efforts to remove Maduro foundered and diplomatic support for Guaidó cracked. Maduro and Putin have not enjoyed particularly close personal relations in the past, and their shared strategic interests are few, but U.S. rhetoric and threats have given them common cause in tweaking us. A meeting in Rome between your special envoy, Elliot Abrams, and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov achieved nothing amid further U.S. sanctions against Venezuela and continued threats that “all options” were on the table.
Publicly available information is insufficient for us to know exactly what was aboard the two Russian aircraft that landed at Maiquetía last week – two months after your Administration publicly proclaimed its intention to remove Maduro – but precedent suggests Moscow had two main objectives. One, and probably primary, is to embarrass your Administration by defying your rhetoric, just to rub your nose in Moscow’s sovereign right to have the relations, including military liaison, with whomever it pleases. In this sense, Russian behavior resembles its intervention, at Bashar al-Assad’s request, in Syria. And it is not a far cry from Moscow’s reaction to the Western-supported coup in Kiev. Another objective, if press speculation about the Russian advisors and equipment aboard the aircraft is correct, would be to shore up Venezuela’s ability to warn of and respond to a U.S. military strike. Your Administration has publicly asserted that the Russians are helping repair S-300 surface-to-air missile systems, which have a purely defensive purpose. There is no evidence, not even circumstantial, that Russia has any offensive objectives in this relationship.
The U.S. reaction has suggested a much greater chance of military confrontation. Mr. Bolton “strongly caution[ed] actors external to the Western Hemisphere against deploying military assets to Venezuela, or elsewhere in the Hemisphere, with the intent of establishing or expanding military operations.” Without defining what activities he would object to, Mr. Bolton said, “We will consider such provocative actions as a direct threat to international peace and security in the region.” Your Special Representative said the “Russian presence” is “extremely pernicious.” Your Secretary of State said, “Russia’s got to leave Venezuela.” You said, “Russia has to get out” and reiterated that “all options are open” – including presumably forcing the Russians out militarily. And we note that Russia has not closed its embassy in Caracas as your Administration has.
Avoiding the Slippery Slope
As intelligence officers and security experts, we have given many years to protecting our nation from a host of threats, including from the Soviet Union. We also believe, however, that picking fights. including ousting governments, blocking negotiated settlements, and threatening other countries’ sovereign decision to pursue activities that do not threaten our national security – is rarely the wise way to go.
We repeat that we are not defending Maduro and his record, while at the same time pointing out that many of his troubles have been exacerbated by U.S. policies and efforts to oust him. We believe that due process and practical, realistic policies better protect our national interests than threats and confrontational rhetoric. It strains credulity to believe that your advisors picked this fight with President Maduro without realizing that Venezuela would seek help fixing its defensive capabilities.
Moreover and very seriously, rhetoric challenging Russia could all too easily lead to a much more consequential confrontation. Invoking the 1823 Monroe Doctrine is unhelpful. For Russia to provide assistance for purely defensive purposes to a country in which we seek to create regime change and threaten military attack would not be widely seen as violating the Monroe Doctrine or crossing a “red line.” We realize that some in the media are trying to egg you on into taking forceful action, perhaps even of a military nature, to punish Russia in any case. We urge you not to fall into this trap. This is not 19th century Latin America, and it is a far cry from the Cuba missile crisis of 1962. The best way to prevent dangerous miscalculation would be for you to speak directly with President Putin. Washington’s energies would be better spent clearing up differences, adjusting failed policies, and promoting a peaceful resolution in Venezuela.

Dear Trump: Top 7 Signs Puerto Ricans might be Americans,www.therussophile.org,Juan Cole,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/dear-trump-top-7-signs-puerto-ricans-might-be-americans.html/,"From Informed Comment – Advertisement –
Trump caused a brouhaha by tweeting that Puerto Rican officials “only take from USA,” as though they weren’t part of the USA! Then his White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley called Puerto Rico “that country” during an interview on MSNBC Live with Hallie Jackson.
Trump seems to me to have some form of dementia, which would account for why he keeps saying strange things like that his father was born in a very nice place in Germany. Fred Drumpf was born in New York City in 1905 and later changed his name to Trump because of anti-immigrant (anti-German) sentiment during World War I.
So there are some ways that you can tell that Puerto Ricans are Americans. – Advertisement –
1. Puerto Rico came to be part of the United States because on July 25, 1898, the US invaded the island, and then annexed it via the Treaty of Paris on April 11, 1899. (Sam Erman, “Meanings of Citizenship in the U.S. Empire: Puerto Rico, Isabel Gonzalez, and the Supreme Court, 1898 to 1905,” Journal of American Ethnic History , Vol. 27, No. 4 (Summer, 2008), pp. 5-33.)
2. As early as 1904, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Isabel Gonzales that Puerto Ricans could not be excluded by immigration authorities, inasmuch as they were not aliens (Gonzales v. Williams, 1904). This ruling was a baby step toward accepting that the island, having been annexed from Spain by the US congress, was no longer alien to the US. (Sam Erman).
3. The Jones Act of 1917 recognized Puerto Ricans as US citizens. Because Puerto Rico itself is a commonwealth rather than a state, Puerto Ricans residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote for president. – Advertisement –
4. Charles R. Venator-Santiago writes, “In 1934, Congress introduced a territorial form of birthright citizenship permitting the children of Puerto Ricans born in the island to acquire U.S. citizenship at birth.”
5. Since Puerto Ricans are full citizens, when they move to the mainland and reside in a state, they can vote for president, just like any other citizen of the US resident in that state. I have an educated guess for whom they are not voting in 2020.
6. Since 1952, even Puerto Ricans residing in Puerto Rico have had a representative in the House of Representatives, a non-voting “resident commissioner.” Other countries don’t typically have representatives in Congress, though there is a nagging doubt that Mitch McConnell actually views the Kremlin as his constituency.

Blatant bias against ‘crazy hair’ Bernie Sanders at Washington Post goes unnoticed by rest of media,www.therussophile.org,Micheal,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/blatant-bias-against-crazy-hair-bernie-sanders-at-washington-post-goes-unnoticed-by-rest-of-media.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
The Washington Post has a problem with Bernie Sanders. Since March 18, the newspaper has run no less than 10 anti-Sanders op-eds — and its agenda approaching the 2020 election has become glaringly obvious.
The recent spate of anti-Sanders screeds was highlighted on Twitter by columnist and Sanders campaign advisor David Sirota, who posted screenshot images showing a selection of the headlines in question.
“The press can’t let Sanders duck the hard questions,” demands one. “Bernie Sanders has emerged as the Donald Trump of the left,” declares another.“Electability’ and ‘Bernie’ don’t belong in the same sentence,” argues another.
Of the 10 pieces, five of them were written by conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin who seems to have developed a laser-focused hatred of the Vermont senator. The remaining five were posted by a selection of other writers.
The column labelling Sanders the “Trump of the left” was widely mocked on Twitter, where it was noted that author Dana Milbank’s wife work’s for Democratic presidential candidate John Hickenlooper and that comparing the two men based on their “weird hair” probably wasn’t a great road to go down (Milbank referred to Sanders’ “crazy hair” in the critique).

"If NATO wouldn't have produced so much chaos and destruction around the world, one of its most characteristic propaganda ads would make you laugh",www.therussophile.org,Micheal,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/if-nato-wouldnt-have-produced-so-much-chaos-and-destruction-around-the-world-one-of-its-most-characteristic-propaganda-ads-would-make-you-laugh.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s 70th anniversary, was met with anti-NATO protests across the world, including Washington D.C. On April 4th 1949, the alliance’s treaty was signed by twelve organizations and today it has grown to 29 members.
As Engler pointed out:
After World War II, the Soviet Union was not a threat to Western Europe, but indigenous, socialist, and Communist parties in Italy, in Greece, in France, had a lot of support. And they would have won an election in Italy, almost won 30 percent of the vote in France, and would have took power in Greece if it wasn’t for US intervention.
What NATO was designed to do was to blunt the European Left – and in the words of Canada’s Foreign Minister, “ a conquest from within. ” That was the objective of NATO, to stop a conquest within (i.e. a Socialist or Communist taking power internally).
The secondary reason for the creation of NATO and why it continues to exist today is because NATO was designed to reinforce European colonial power in Africa and Asia and bring it under a US-led geopolitical umbrella and basically to have this alliance that brings the leading capitalist countries together to dominate the world under Washington’s lead. And that’s something that Washington has continued to want to do around the world.
The end of the Soviet Union didn’t end Washington’s desire to dominate the world. And so NATO as a tool for that domination has really continued on until today and in fact, become more belligerent since the end of the Cold War.

Observe one of the most characteristic NATO ads presented during the interview above. The outrageously blatant propaganda here could be easily considered a very bad joke.
So, according to NATO that wants to justify its existence:
Today, we face a much broader range of threats than in the past. To the east, Russia has become more assertive with the illegal annexation of Crimea and destabilization of eastern Ukraine, as well as its military buildup close to NATO’s borders. During the Arab Spring, NATO led an air campaign over Libya to protect civilians being targeted by the Gaddafi dictatorship. NATO and its partners have helped to prevent piracy off the Horn of Africa and are cooperating to fight terrorism in the Mediterranean Sea. NATO has also supported international efforts to stem illegal migration and human trafficking in the Aegean Sea.
In only a few lines you can find lies, double standards and deliberately ignored facts in abundance. Brought to you by the most ruthless neocolonial force, which produces chaos and destruction around the planet for decades.

"Like Libya and Syria, Venezuela Is not just about oil",www.therussophile.org,Ashley Bailey,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/like-libya-and-syria-venezuela-is-not-just-about-oil-5.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
sott.net/news
Yes, the latest research confirms that Venezuela is so rich in natural resources, that it could single-handedly satisfy all global demand for oil, for over 30 years. And it has much more than oil to offer, in its Orinoco basin and in other areas of the country.
But it is not all ‘about oil’; actually, far from it.
Those who believe that what propels the spread of Western terror all over the world, are just some ‘business interests’ and legendary Western greed, are, from my point of view, missing the point.
I noticed that such individuals and analysts actually believe that ‘capitalism is responsible for everything’, and that it creates the culture of violence of which, both victims and victimizers, already became hostages to.
After working in all corners of the world, I am now more and more convinced that capitalism is actually the result of Western culture, which is predominantly based on expansionism, exceptionalism and aggression. It is also constructed on a deeply rooted desire to control and to dictate. Financial/monetary greed is just a by-product of this culture which has elevated its superiority to something that could be defined as religious, or even religiously fundamentalist.
Or in other words: belief in its own superiority is actually now the main religion in both Europe and North America.
What makes the Libyan, Syrian and Venezuelan scenarios so similar? Why was the West so eager to viciously attack, and then destroy these three, at the first glance, very different countries?
The answer is simple, although it is not often uttered in the West; at least not publicly:
‘All three countries stood at the vanguard of promoting and fighting with determination for such concepts as “pan-Africanism”, “pan-Arabism” and Patria Grande – essentially Latin American independence and unity.’
Gaddafi, Al-Assad and Chavez have been, regionally and internationally, recognized as anti-imperialist fighters, inspiring and giving hope to hundreds of millions of people.
Gaddafi was murdered, Chavez was most likely killed as well, and Al-Assad and his nation have been, literally and for several long years, fighting for their survival.
The current Venezuelan President Maduro, who is determinedly loyal to the Bolivarian revolutionary ideals, has already survived at least one assassination attempt , and, is now facing direct mafia-style threats from the West. At any moment, his country could get attacked, directly or through the Latin American ‘client’ states of the West.
It is because Africa, the Middle East and Latin America have been considered, and for centuries treated, as colonies. It is because whenever people stood up, they were almost immediately smashed into pieces by the iron fist of Western imperialism. And those who think that they are in control of the world by some divine design, do not want things to change, ever.
Europe and North America are obsessed with controlling others, and in order to control, they feel that they have to make sure to exterminate all opposition in their colonies and neo-colonies.
It is a truly mental state in which the West has found itself; a state which I, in my earlier works, defined as Sadistic Personality Disorder (SPD).
To get the complete picture, one also has to recall Indonesia, which was literally liquidated as an independent and progressive nation , in 1965. Its internationalist president Sukarno (father of the Non-Aligned Movement, and close ally of the Communist Party of Indonesia – PKI) was overthrown by the handpicked (by the West), treasonous, intellectually and morally deranged, General Suharto, opening the door to turbo-capitalism, and to the unbridled plunder of the natural resources of his nation. Once a guiding light for the entire Asian independence struggle, after the US/UK/Australia-orchestrated extreme genocide , Indonesia has been reduced to nothing more than a lobotomized and dirt-poor ‘client’ state of the West.
The West has an incredible capacity to identify true regional independence leaders ; to smear them, to make them vulnerable by inventing and then upholding so-called ‘local opposition’, and later, by liquidating them and with them, also their countries and even their entire regions.
Sometimes, the West attacks particular countries, as was the case with Iran (1953), Iraq, or Nicaragua. But more often, it goes directly for the ‘big fish’ – leaders of regional opposition – such as Libya, Indonesia, Syria, and now, Venezuela.
Many defiant individuals have literally been murdered already: Gaddafi, Hussein, Lumumba , and Chavez, to name just a few.
And of course, whatever it does, the West is trying to destroy the greatest leaders of the anti-Western and anti-imperialist coalition: Russia and China.
It is all far from only being about oil, or about profits.
The West needs to rule. It is obsessed with controlling the world, with feeling superior and exceptional. It is a game, a deadly game. For centuries, the West has been behaving like a fundamentalist religious fanatic, and its people have never even noticed that their world views have actually became synonymous with exceptionalism, and with cultural superiority. That is why the West is so successful in creating and injecting extremist religious movements of all denominations, into virtually all parts of the world : from Oceania to Asia, from Africa to Latin America, and of course, to China. Western leaders are ‘at home’ with Christian, Muslim or even Buddhist extremists.
But Syria has managed to survive, and up to today it is standing. The only reason why the government forces are not taking the last terrorist bastion, Idlib, yet, is because the civilian population would suffer tremendous losses during the battle.
Venezuela is also refusing to kneel and to surrender. And it is clear that if the West and its allies dared to attack, the resistance, the millions of people, would fight for the villages and countryside, and if needed, would withdraw to the jungle and wage a guerilla liberation war against the occupiers, and against the treasonous elites.
Washington, London, Paris and Madrid are clearly using an extremely outdated strategy: one that worked against Libya, but which failed squarely in Syria.
Recently, in Syria, near the frontline of Idlib, two top commanders told me that they are fighting “not only for Syria, but for the entire oppressed world, including Venezuela.” They clearly detected that the West is using precisely the same strategy against Caracas, which it tried to use against Damascus.
Now, Venezuela is also suffering and fighting for the entire oppressed world.
It has ‘no right to fail’, as Syria had no right to surrender.
The destruction of Libya had already brought a tremendously negative impact on Africa. And it has opened the doors to the renewed and unbridled French plunder of the continent. France was promptly joined by the U.K. and the U.S.A.
Syria is the last bastion in the Middle East. It is all there is now, resisting the total control of the Middle East by the West. Syria and Iran. But Iran is not yet a ‘front’, although often it appears that soon it might become one.
Venezuela cannot fall, for the same reasons. It is at the northern extreme of South America. Below, there is an entire continent; terrorized by Europe and North America, for decades and centuries: brutalized, plundered, tortured. South America, where tens of millions used to be exterminated like animals, forced to convert to Christianity, robbed of everything and ordered to follow bizarre Western political and economic models.
In Brazil, the progressive socialist government of the PT had been already overthrown.
If Venezuela falls, everything could be lost, for decades, maybe even centuries.
And so, it will fight. Together with those few other countries that are still left standing in this ‘Western Hemisphere’; countries which the dictators in Washington D.C. openly describe as ‘their backyard’.
Caracas stands and fights for the vast slums of Peru, for destitute millions in Paraguay, for Brazilian favelas, for privatized aquifers and the murdered rain forest in Brazil.
As Syria has been fighting for the Palestine, for the destitute minorities in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, for Yemen, for Iraq and Afghanistan – two countries robbed of almost everything by NATO.
Russia has already showed what it can do for its Arab brothers, and now is demonstrating its willingness to support its another close ally – Venezuela.
China is rapidly joining the coalition of anti-imperialist fighters, and so is South Africa.
No – Venezuela is not only about oil.
It is about the West being able to close access to the Panama Canal, by Chinese ships.
It is about the total control of the world : ideological, political, economic and social. About liquidating all opposition in the Western hemisphere.
If Venezuela falls, the West may dare to attack Nicaragua, and then the bastion of socialism and internationalism – Cuba.
That is why it – Venezuela – should never be allowed to fall.
The battle for Venezuela is now already raging, on all fronts, including the ideological one. There, we are not only fighting for Caracas, Maracaibo or for Ciudad Bolivar: we are fighting for the entire oppressed world, as we did and are doing in Damascus, Aleppo, Homs and Idlib, as we may soon have to do in many other cities, all over the world. For as long as Western imperialism is alive; for as long as it is not going to give up its dreams of controlling and ruining the entire planet, we cannot rest, we cannot let down our guard, we cannot celebrate final victory in any part of the world.
Therefore, this is all far from being ‘just about oil’. It is about the survival of our planet.

WASHINGTON, April 5. /TASS/. Foreign ministers of NATO member-states agreed on Thursday to expand surveillance operations in the Black Sea and also to increase the number of drills in the region jointly with Ukraine and Georgia, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters on Thursday, commenting on the alliance’s Washington meeting.
“We are stepping up our efforts in the Black Sea or the Black Sea region. We just agreed the package on more surveillance exercises and all the issues which we strongly believe are relevant for the Black Sea region and of course also work with our partners Georgia and Ukraine,” Stoltenberg stressed, noting that NATO is patrolling the region’s airspace.
According to Stoltenberg, the alliance is working with its “close partners” in the region – Georgia and Ukraine. “Now as we speak one of NATO’s naval standing groups is deployed in the Black Sea and is actually exercising in both with Georgian and Ukrainian naval forces. This shows that NATO has increased its presence in the Black Sea region with more naval presence,” he said, adding that the alliance is strengthening its cooperation with Georgia and Ukraine.
The NATO chief did not mention the alliance’s plans to guarantee the passage of Ukraine’s vessels through the Kerch Strait, what US Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison had said earlier.
Kerch Strait standoff
On November 25, 2018 three warships of the Ukrainian Navy violated the rules of passage through Russia’s territorial waters while en route from the Black Sea to the Azov Sea. The Russian side had to use weapons to compel the ships to stop. Three Ukrainian servicemen were lightly wounded. They received medical assistance. The ships were detained and escorted to the port of Kerch. A criminal case was launched on border violation charges.
Moscow described the incident as a provocation. The Ukrainian authorities declared martial law. The EU and NATO called for de-escalation of the situation. A number of countries, including the United States, criticized Russia and called for releasing the Ukrainian sailors.
Twenty-four Ukrainian sailors were arrested and taken to a Moscow pre-trial detention center. They have been charged with illegally crossing Russia’s state border, and face up to six years in jail if found guilty. Earlier, Moscow’s Lefortovo court extended their arrest until April 24.

"After Mueller, Donald Trump’s “Political Warfare” Enters a Dangerous New Phase",www.therussophile.org,Cherise,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/after-mueller-donald-trumps-political-warfare-enters-a-dangerous-new-phase.html/,"Democrats Formally Demand Trump’s Tax Returns
Donald Trump is a political pugilist. He never apologizes for a mistake. He never admits that he is wrong. He constantly attacks. In many ways Donald Trump is a 72-year-old political version of the Terminator, a machine that “can’t be reasoned with, it can’t be bargained with…. it doesn’t feel pity of remorse or fear … and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.”
Two Fridays ago Donald Trump was told that his handpicked attorney general had received special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the 2016 election. Trump had two reasons to celebrate.
Mueller had concluded that the Trump campaign did not directly conspire with the Russian government to steal the 2016 presidential election from the American people and Hillary Clinton. Never miss another story
Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.
On the question of obstruction of justice, Robert Mueller did not make a decision. There is significant evidence that Donald Trump did in fact obstruct justice in his efforts to derail the Trump-Russia investigation. Mueller instead chose to allow his boss and Trump’s personal insurance policy, Attorney General William Barr, to make the final decision. It was a fait accompli: Barr has been publicly hostile to any investigation into Trump’s connections with Russia — and also believes that the president is more like a king than a democratically elected leader with limits on his power. He decided that Trump was innocent.
As reported by New York Magazine , Trump was exuberant. According to a White House aide, Trump said of Mueller’s report, “This is great. This is incredible. This is what I’ve been saying all along. There’s no collusion. I never talked to any Russians.”
Trump’s vindication is far from complete. The actual findings of the 400-page Mueller report have not been made public. His legal troubles have not ended either. The Southern District of New York investigation continues; his close adviser Roger Stone will face trial for lying to Congress; counterintelligence investigations into Trump and his inner circles’ contacts with Russian agents continue; House Democrats are conducting public hearings. Nonetheless, Trump and his allies are screaming exoneration.
Their campaign of revenge has many targets.
Trump has claimed that there was an attempted coup against his presidency and by extension the United States . His critics in the news media and Congress are to be silenced, blacklisted and sued for libel and slander . Trump has drawn up enemies’ lists. Trump and the right-wing media continue to engage in stochastic terrorism and scripted violence . The Democrats, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama are enemies of the people. Clinton and Obama are in fact “traitors” who lead a “deep state” conspiracy against Donald Trump.
This is bad for America, but in many ways good politics for Donald Trump and the Republican Party. Public opinion polls and other research show that Trump’s proverbial white working-class supporters and other Republican voters actually believe that they are “oppressed” by liberals, black people and other nonwhites, gays and lesbians, immigrants and Muslims.
For Trump’s political cultists the calculus is simple: They are Trump. Ergo, when Trump is attacked they are also attacked. The personal is political in this most crude and literal example of white identity politics, where Trumpism is not merely a set of political positions but a lifestyle and way of being in the world.
In some ways, Trump and the right-wing movement’s pugilistic attacks are a decades-old strategy.
The “paranoid style” and its belief in victimization and in enemies around every corner and under every bed has been a fixture of American conservatism since the 1950s .
Wrecking the machinery of democratic governance through show trial hearings and a blatant disregard for standing rules and procedure and precedent have been used by conservatives since the era of Joseph McCarthy, and then against the Clinton administration.
White racial resentment and overt racism allowed and encouraged Republicans to amplify their obstruction against Barack Obama.
Newt Gingrich helped to write the playbook for the right wing’s assault on the Democratic Party with his Contract with America and his 1996 GOPAC memo “Language: A Key Mechanism of Control.”
But there is something relatively new and especially dangerous — even as judged relative to the above examples — in Trump’s strategy of endless attacks. In the tsunami of chaos and distraction that is a feature of Trump’s regime many stories and events that would in more normal times, be a focus of great attention by both the news media and the American people are overlooked.
In May 2017, Richard Higgins, who worked in the National Security Council’s strategic planning office wrote and circulated a seven-page memo called “POTUS & Political Warfare,” which reportedly reached Donald Trump’s desk. This document crystallized the racist, nativist, xenophobic and paranoid worldview and policy positions of the alt-right in the form of strategic advice for President Trump.
Higgins cautioned that those who saw Trump as “an existential threat to cultural Marxist memes that dominate the prevailing cultural narrative” would seek his destruction.
Far from politics as usual, this is a political warfare effort that seeks the destruction of a sitting president. Since Trump took office, the situation has intensified to crisis level proportions. For those engaged in the effort, especially those from within the “deep state” or permanent government apparatus, this raises clear Title 18 (legal) concerns.
Trump’s enemies, Higgins noted, were not necessarily “Marxists as conventionally understood,” but included “‘deep state’ actors, globalists, bankers, Islamists, and establishment Republicans.”
Higgins concluded with what he clearly meant as stirring prose, claiming that “the defense of President Trump is the defense of America,” and explaining that racial diversity and efforts to ensure the equal rights of nonwhites, women and other groups are a threat to American security:
Globalists and lslamists recognize that for their visions to succeed, America, both as an ideal and as a national and political identity, must be destroyed. Atomization of society must also occur at the individual level; with attacks directed against all levels of group and personal identity. Hence the sexism, racism and xenophobia memes. As a Judeo-Christian culture, forced inclusion of post-modern notions of tolerance is designed to induce nihilistic contradictions that reduce all thought, all faith, all loyalties to meaninglessness. Group rights based on sex or ethnicity are a direct assault on the very idea of individual human rights and natural law around which the Constitution was framed.
I reached out by email to sociologist James Scaminaci III, an expert on the strategy and tactics of far-right extremists, asking him to explain the overarching themes of the “POTUS & Political Warfare” memo:
First, white supremacy, or the narrative that white men built America for white men to exploit and enjoy. Thus, all non-whites and non-men, occupy at best a secondary status in terms of rights and material goods.
Second, the narrative of the John Birch Society. Specifically, the JBS stated that the political elites of both parties were American traitors operating to the benefit of the Soviet Union. The USSR has been replaced by the “ Muslim Brotherhood ” or “ Islamists .”
Third, the Christian Right’s narrative provided a religious version of the JBS’s secular version of “the Insiders” or “globalists” betraying America.
All sources of information that did not conform to their “ biblical worldview ” [are] illegitimate . Thus, it is no surprise that white fundagelicals (to borrow a term) trust Fox News, distrust all other sources of information, and are opposed to the scientific theories of evolution and climate change.
The fourth strand combines the first three into a comprehensive narrative of “cultural Marxism” or “Political Correctness.” The “cultural Marxist” narrative was that the political elites of both parties were under the sway of explicitly or implicitly Jewish intellectuals who moved the “Frankfurt School” from Nazi Germany in the 1930s to America with the express objective of destroying Western civilization and Christianity.
The fifth and final strand is added by Stephen Bannon and his billionaire backers the Mercer family . Operating through Cambridge Analytica and Breitbart News , Bannon combined the “ cultural Marxism” narrative , the white nationalist and Christian nationalist narratives with a right-wing populism narrative .
This narrative would become the lingua franca of the entire conservative movement and envelop the Republican Party, thus enabling Donald Trump to use its narrative and code words to a knowing audience…. The Higgins memo’s unique contribution was to weave all these narratives and themes together for a sitting president as a National Security Council memo.
The Higgins memo does more than articulate an ideology that frames America’s multiracial democracy as a threat. “POTUS & Political Warfare” advises the president of the United States, to engage in a battle against his “enemies” — which includes large segments of the American public.
Through this logic Trump is not responsible for the general welfare, prosperity, safety and security of the American people, or for protecting and nurturing the country’s democracy. Reasonable consensus and coalition-building are eschewed. In practice, social fissures within American society are to be exploded for the political and personal gain of Trump, his allies and the global kleptocrats. Only “real Americans” matter, defined by today’s conservative movement as white, right-wing, male Christians.
The political principles to which Donald Trump and his movement are committed rest upon cruelty in the service of avarice. Destroying American government and any public sense of social democracy and collective responsibility in the service of the common good is a means of achieving that goal. Before Trump’s election, Steve Bannon famously described himself as a “Leninist,” defining that concept this way:
“Lenin,” he answered, “wanted to destroy the state, and that’s my goal too. I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment.” Bannon was employing Lenin’s strategy for Tea Party populist goals. He included in that group the Republican and Democratic Parties, as well as the traditional conservative press.
This philosophy has been applied by the Trump administration across a range of policies, including building the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, putting immigrants and refugees in concentration camps, punishing the people of Puerto Rico because of the Hurricane Maria disaster, attacking the legitimacy of the free press, rolling back civil rights protections, overturning environmental regulations, encouraging political violence against those who oppose Trumpism, empowering right-wing hate groups and domestic terrorists, gutting the social safety net to give even more money to the richest Americans, and destroying the Affordable Care Act, which has the practical effect of making more people sick and therefore shortening their lives.
Scaminaci told me, “Trump’s main view of America, the Constitution, and the American people has always been contempt. It is only Trump who can understand the problems better than any expert or flag-officer; it is only Trump who can voice the subconscious thoughts and yearnings of the people; and, it is only Trump who ‘can fix’ all the problems. Trump as the right-wing authoritarian leader appeals to authoritarian white and Christian nationalists who hold that the elites of both political parties, the Constitution, and mainstream media are illegitimate. Trump and his right-wing media allies amplify fear and anger at a moving set of targets depending upon which person or institution needs to be attacked that day or week.”
“Trump’s objective, as it has been from the start of his political campaign back in the 1980s, has been to delegitimize whichever target would advance his personal cause,” Scaminaci continued But his personal cause is now fused with a white Christian nationalist agenda that seeks to reconstruct … a white, Christian America in which rich, white, heterosexual Christian men hold political, economic, and cultural superiority and dominance.”
Chaos, cruelty, sexism, violence, bigotry, racism and a belief that power is best used to destroy and not create are the hallmarks of Trumpism and today’s conservative movement. These are features, not bugs. This is the new normal. Those Americans — especially pundits and journalists — who still naively believe that the old order will return once Trump is gone from office are making a dangerous error of inference and conclusion.
America is changed. And the American people have been changed as well by Trump and his allies’ blitzkrieg against the country’s democratic institutions, norms and values.

McConnell Goes Nuclear to Help Trump Pack the Courts With Extremists,www.therussophile.org,Merula Furtado,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/mcconnell-goes-nuclear-to-help-trump-pack-the-courts-with-extremists.html/,"Democrats Formally Demand Trump’s Tax Returns
NAACP Legal Defense Fund attorney Janai Nelson said it was an “insult to African Americans” when President Trump nominated Thomas Farr to a federal district court bench in North Carolina last year. The Republican attorney’s fingerprints were all over efforts to suppress and sideline voters of color in North Carolina, and he was linked to a campaign committee for segregationist Sen. Jesse Helms accused of intimidating Black voters in the late 1980s with postcards suggesting they would be arrested at the polls.
Fortunately, Farr’s anti-civil rights record came to light just in time for a few Republican defectors to sink his nomination, thanks to Senate rules allowing up to 30 hours for debate on presidential nominees, according to Nelson. Now that Senate Republicans have voted to drastically change those confirmation rules, Nelson worries extremists like Farr could gain lifetime appointments to federal courts as Trump seeks to keep a major campaign promise to his base and push the judiciary further right.
“Some of the administration’s most egregious picks for the courts, like Thomas Farr, have been stopped because of concerns that were unearthed in this critical final debate period,” Nelson told reporters on Wednesday. “This move will diminish each senator’s opportunity to sufficiently vet candidates for the federal bench, effectively obliterating the constitutional obligation to ‘advise and consent’ on judicial nominees.” Stay in the loop
Never miss the news and analysis you care about.
Despite pleas from civil rights groups, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell invoked the “nuclear option” on Wednesday, allowing a simple majority of Republicans to reduce debate on dozens of presidential nominees from up to 30 hours to only two. The Senate voted 51-48 along party lines to approve the new rules, which limit debate on Trump nominees to federal district courts as well as dozens of sub-Cabinet administrative posts. Nominations to top courts and Cabinet positions are exempt.
“Two hours for a lifetime appointment with huge impacts on people’s lives is unacceptable; it’s ridiculous, it’s a mockery of how this institution should work,” Democratic Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor Wednesday.
Before the vote, McConnell and other top Republicans blamed a backlog of low-profile administrative nominations on obstructionist Democrats. However, Democrats said Trump and McConnell have already used the GOP’s majority in the Senate to pack federal courts with judges at a record pace, even as lawmakers blocked confirmations for several nominees whose young age and hard-right ideology appeared to be their only judicial qualification.
“Mitch McConnell has indeed prioritized the confirmation of federal judges, and he continues to try to mislead the American people about what is happening in the judicial nominations process,” said Dan Goldberg, legal director of the Alliance for Justice, in an email. “In the first two years of his presidency, President Trump outpaced President Obama’s federal judicial confirmations, largely because of Republican tactics of gutting rules and norms to speed through virtually every Trump judicial nominee.” “By rigging the system, Republicans are consolidating their power and directly jeopardizing our civil and human rights.”
Civil rights groups said Wednesday’s rule change would speed up confirmations and help Republicans conceal the controversial records that many Trump nominees bring with them, allowing conservatives to circumvent Congress and push an agenda that voters across the country would not support.
“By rigging the system, Republicans are consolidating their power and directly jeopardizing our civil and human rights,” said Kristine Lucius, executive vice president for policy at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, in a press conference before the vote.
A coalition of civil rights, reproductive justice and LGTBQ groups are drawing attention to Trump’s nominees with troubling records. For example, Wendy Vitter, a lawyer from New Orleans and wife of David Vitter, the former senator who was wrapped in scandal , has attempted to distance herself from a history of pro-life activism that includes a conference where unscientific claims about abortion were made.
“Senate Republicans are trying to speed up the process for anti-abortion nominees like Wendy Vitter, who will decide on our health and rights for a lifetime,” said Cecelia Thomas, legislative manager at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a press conference.
And then there is Howard Nielson and Matthew Kacsmaryk, two Trump nominees that civil rights groups say have a history of anti-LGBTQ activism . Both men have argued against same-sex marriage rights in the past, and Kacsmaryk has shown particular animus toward transgender people, describing trans identities as “a delusion,” according to Harper Jean Tobin, director of policy at the National Center for Transgender Equality.
“This president has shown he has no respect for the courts unless they serve his political ends and his bigoted agenda,” Tobin said.
The list goes on. While Trump promised his base that he would pack the courts with social conservatives who oppose abortion and LGBTQ rights, civil rights advocates say Republicans in Congress may live to regret Wednesday’s rule change. Trump appointees could spark public backlash if they make regressive rulings from the bench, and if the Democrats regain control of the Senate, they can use the new debate limits to their advantage in the future.
