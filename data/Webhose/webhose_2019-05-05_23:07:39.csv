How could my critical thinking be better than Trump’s critical thinking? First, he’s a unquestionable genius.

So, my rational decision is to follow Trump closely, and to support him 100%.
He wakes up every day and every single decision he makes is made to make America great again. Therefore, by definition, all of his decisions are right and further our collective cause of making America great again. I suspect you might not want America to be great again, and I guess that’s your right."
