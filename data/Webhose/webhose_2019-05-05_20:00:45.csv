I can't see such a promise bringing back the black voters who defected from the Democrats to vote for Trump in 2016 or who, like in Wayne County, MI (the home of Detroit), weren't enthusiastic enough about the Democrat candidate to bother voting at all.
A promise to be the third term of the Brown Bathhouse is only going to remind black voters of how much ground they LOST economically during the Obama presidency, so I can't imagine they'll be clamoring for a RETURN of that malaise."

And THAT'S why I've oft-posted on this site that neither Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, nor Beto O'Rourke will be the Democrats' presidential candidate in 2020, even if ALL of them run on being Obama's third term.
Just as Hillary, NOT being bl ck, wasn't able to excite bl ck voters to turn out for her in 2016, so it will be with Biden, Sanders, and O'Rourke, and thus that's why I'm betting the farm at this moment that the 2020 Democrat presidential candidate will be Kamala Harris.

Here's another thing to consider, they have numbers that probably aren't fully appreciated. Millions and millions of ""Americans' no longer have traditional values, they don't value life of the unborn, they don't go to church, they think lying is business as usual, they do not have the values that many people 50 and over have.

As far as whether the PTBs will allow some kind of internecine bloodbath, as I have ALSO oft-posted about this, if the Left goes on the warpath in the manner I have posited, Republican governors and mayors will be well-able to handle any outbreaks of leftist violence in their fiefdoms, by calling out their state National Guard if need be, all they will need is a president who will not interfere with them doing what they have to do to restore law and order in their states, and in Trump, they have such a president.
Which means that it will be up to DEMOCRAT PTBs to decide how much internecine violence they're going to allow in THEIR fiefdoms: would Governor Andrew Cuomo and NYC Mayor De Bolshevik, for example, allow violent lefties to shut down Wall Street and the operations of firms like Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank for an extended period of time unchallenged just to show that they're ""down"" with the leftist cause? I strongly suspect that if they DID, the New York business community, even if much of it is liberal, will be SCREAMING at them, because even in a leftist enclaves like NYC, the libs there STILL want to make a buck, and they won't take kindly to Democrat PTBs that make that impossible for them.
As far as the numbers the Left supposedly has, the vast majority of these people are Pajama Bois and metrosexuals and gender-confused individuals and angry feminazis who would melt like snow on warm ground at the first whiff of grapeshot, and the vast majority of them ALSO have an almost INFANTILE aversion to firearms. Even the Antifa and BlackLivesMatter types have shown absolutely NO inclination to challenge us armed deplorables on our OWN turf because they only go on the warpath in places - our blue enclaves - where they KNOW they will face no pushback of consequence for their violence and where the deck is totally stacked in their favor, and in a Trump second term, I see absolutely NO reason to believe that this is going to change."
