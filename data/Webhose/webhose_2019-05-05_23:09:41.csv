To the contrary, the regulations callupon the attorney general, William Barr, to receive the confidentialreport and then do two things: First, to notify Congress of theinvestigation’s completion and, second, to provide an explanation for certain specifically enumerated actions. There is no requirement for a Barr-edited version of the Mueller report"""

Periods and 'dick pic' posters ignite feminist firestorm in Pakistan - Breitbart,www.breitbart.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/news/periods-and-dick-pic-posters-ignite-feminist-firestorm-in-pakistan-2/,"Periods and ‘dick pic’ posters ignite feminist firestorm in Pakistan AFP 6 Apr 2019
Lahore (Pakistan) (AFP) –“Anything you can do I can do while bleeding,” read one defiant poster at a recent women’s march in Pakistan, while another demanded: “Keep your dick pics to yourself”. Then came the backlash, including rape and death threats.
The posters were just part of the colourful spectacle as tens of thousands of women took to the streets for the second annual Aurat (Women) march in major cities across Pakistan, marking International Women’s Day on March 8.
But this year the slogans caught the attention of the media, many of whom showcased them online, while a handful of the most provocative went viral — igniting weeks of outrage, with shocked organisers reposting a slew of violent threats.
The uproar has provoked a rare and at times acrimonious debate on women’s rights and cultural values in a conservative Muslim country that has, until now, been largely unconcerned with the global #MeToo movement.
Celebrities and television personalities have weighed in, and a retaliatory “Men’s March” was even organised in Karachi, though reports suggest just two showed up.
One Karachi cleric, offended by a poster that announced “My body, my choice”, used twisted logic to claim that men, also, have agency over their bodies — therefore they have a right to sex with whomever they want.
“My body my choice … your body your choice … Then men’s body men’s choice … They can climb onto anyone they want,” he argues in a video which swiftly went viral, with tens of thousands of views.
Many of the informal group of activists behind the march said they had expected a reaction, but were taken aback by its ferocity.
“The level to which they took offence, to the point of giving death threats to people who were the organisers … is too much,” says Lubaina Rajbhoy, a graphic designer whose posters evoking Communist revolutions became emblematic of the march.
The backlash against the slogans, Rajbhoy said, “shows a height of intolerance in our country, which again is one of the purposes of the march”.
–‘Equal rights for all’–
Women have long fought for basic rights in Pakistan, where activists say men commit “pervasive and intractable” violence against them.
Much of society lives under a patriarchal, outdated code of so-called “honour” that systemises the oppression of women who defy tradition by, for example, choosing their own husband or working outside the home.
Hundreds of women are killed by men in Pakistan each year for “honour”.
As with women’s movements elsewhere, the uproar was partly fuelled by fears “feminism” means hatred of men —“which is not true at all”, says organiser Leena Ghani.
“We are asking for … equal rights for all,” she said. “To be honest, everyone is affected by patriarchy.”
But the signs also invoked what many saw as the encroachment of elitist and Western cultural values on a post-colonial, Islamic society.
The slogan “Keep your dick pics to yourself” drew particular fire, with many angered more by the explicit language than by the spectre of sexual harassment it raised.
Posters invoking menstruation provoked disgust in a country where sex education is almost non-existent and reproductive rights lacking.
And signs promoting divorce and a woman’s rights in marriage were perceived as an attack on Pakistan’s social structure, in which traditional marriages play a central role.
Ride-sharing app Careem caught part of the backlash when it released a lighthearted ad two weeks later showing a runaway bride, the caption reading: “If you want to run away from your wedding, book a Careem bike!”
Critics filed a legal petition against the ad, calling it an “unethical promotional campaign”.
Television host Madiha Masood was among those publicly criticising the march, suggesting it was a project driven by foreign powers — a common conspiracy theory in Pakistan.
“I will not encourage my daughter to depict inappropriate hand gestures, hold a cigarette in her fingers and say, ‘My time has come’. I’m very sorry, I wouldn’t want such a daughter,” she told AFP.
Another high-profile critic was Pakistani feminist icon and poet Kishwar Naheed, who reportedly said she believes feminists should keep their culture and traditions in mind so as not to go astray like “jihadis”— much to the surprise of many who had looked to her for inspiration.
For the marchers, criticism of the posters is a distraction — though the designer Rajbhoy noted the controversy is now being broadcast to women all over the country.
“It’s important for them to see that … there is this group of women that are actually coming out of their homes and marching, and perhaps they wish to participate in it in the future.”

Aggressive Steps Needed to Free Venezuela from Socialists,westernfreepress.com,Howard Levine,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://westernfreepress.com/aggressive-steps-needed-to-free-venezuela-from-socialists/,"Aggressive Steps Needed to Free Venezuela from Socialists Arm Venezuelans to Take Their Country Back - That is REAL Humanitarian Aid By Howard Levine 0 0
News reports of Russia and China sending in equipment and soldiers to Venezuela should be cause for great concern in the United States. The Venezuelans starving to death should be even more concerned. Keep Russia and China Out of the Western Hemisphere
Supposedly, the Russian troops are there to maintain the equipment that they accompanied. It is very likely that the equipment is designed to entrench and protect the socialists Russia is allied with . The Russians probably want to avoid direct military action. However, being in Venezuela puts them directly in the path of forces that want to free Venezuela of its illegitimate socialist government.
The situation is similar to Grenada when the US led an invasion to liberate the country from Russian supported socialists. There are some differences Venezuela has traveled a large distance down the socialist cesspool of societal collapse, it is a bigger country, and there are more socialist supporting soldiers to fight in order to overthrow the government. Foreign Socialist Soldiers only Encourage Venezuelan Socialists
The biggest danger of Russian and Chinese troops being present is that it fortifies the resolve of the socialist government. They and their supporters are encouraged to retain power. Regardless of how many Venezuelans starve, the socialists and their Russian supporters will have enough food to survive. Having the Russians there also gives the socialists hope that a foreign invasion will not get them killed or imprisoned. That is a big problem. Without fear of life, limb, and freedom, the socialists and their supporters in Venezuela have no incentive to give up. They will not welcome a legitimate government that will restore freedom. Active Military Engagement by the United States is Overdue
It is absolutely critical to save the Venezuelan people, advance the cause of liberty, and protect the US sphere of influence that significant direct action take place. Socialists must fear for their lives and give up power to the legitimate government. Massive US military intervention is needed. It must be clear that supporting socialism in Venezuela is a good way to get killed, injured, or imprisoned. Here are some steps that the United States should take to end this crisis quickly and minimize the possibility that it will get out of control. Supply arms and ammunition instead of humanitarian aid
Give the Venezuelan people a chance to take their food from their socialist oppressors. That is better than hoping bits and pieces of food get past Venezuelan army check points. Soldiers who know they are doing something wrong will be less likely to continue doing it if the people they are starving to death shoot back at them.
This is the most important initial step to take. It is more effective than failed attempts at humanitarian aid. It is also the least risky for the United States. Trade Policy
Additional economic sanctions could be placed on Russia and China. Send in US military advisers
Provide Venezuelan freedom fighters with training, some leadership support, and forward observers for calling in air strikes. Start air attacks
Attack socialist leaders in Venezuela and military forces supporting the socialists. These attacks should be devastating and scare the socialists into surrendering or kill as many of them as possible. This will make it easier for free Venezuelans supplied with arms to take their country back. Have military units ready to deploy
Prepare to control key infrastructure, communication centers, and military bases. With any luck, air strikes and support of Venezuelan freedom fighters will be sufficient, but, even if direct US military involvement on the ground is needed, the freedom fighters must get the help they need to throw off the yoke of socialism.
Failure would be a loss for the Venezuelans and for the prestige of the United States. Our prestige is important because it affects our credibility and our ability to quickly and easily resolve issues in our favor in the future. Fear of American resolve will save American lives in the future by making evil people more reluctant to work against American interests. Impose an air/sea/land blockade of Venezuela
Prevent additional Russian or Chinese support from aiding the socialists. Seize ships and shoot down planes as needed to enforce the blockade. Block any reinforcements by land as well. Make it clear that any foreign nationals may leave the country. Of course, as with Grenada, nobody can take any military equipment out and foreign nationals will be searched before being allowed to leave.
To the extent possible, this should done without much fanfare. Challenge Russia and China where they Overreach
Be prepared to take military actions against the Russians and Chinese if they escalate their support for the Maduro regime.
Russia is illegally occupying the Crimea and Ukraine. Russia is also interfering in Syria. The Chinese are interfering with freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.
One or two islands that China manufactured in the South China Sea could be discreetly demolished as freedom of the seas exercises.
Diplomatic statements to set the record straight is important and may avoid problems. However, Russia and China need to realize that we will challenge them in what they perceive to be their spheres of influence if they challenge us in ours. They are unlikely to respond just to words not backed by military action. Reinforce Our Allies Near Russia and China
We should reinforce the Baltic States with US combat units to show the Russians that they cannot intimidate the US or its allies.
We should directly supply Taiwan with military sales to strengthen its military as a message to China that they do not intimidate the US or its allies.
Protect Our Neighborhood Stop Russian and Chinese Misadventures in Their Tracks
The point is simply this: Venezuela is in our back yard and run by Socialists who are starving their population. We cannot let Russia and China continue to prop up the Socialists in Venezuela. They oppress the people by refusing to give up power to legitimate Venezuelan political leaders.
The Russian and Chinese governments need to be slapped down hard in this situation, or we will have them making mischief for us everywhere in the world. We already have problems with Ukraine and the South China Sea. Not responding to a challenge in our own hemisphere will lead to US forces being stretched too thinly. It will also lead other countries to lose faith in the United States and try to cut deals with the Russians and Chinese.
Decisive action now with willing Venezuelan allies can save American lives and protect American allies by discouraging military misadventures by our enemies in the future. 2 shares"
Who Controls America’s Courts? Creeping Sharia . . .,westernfreepress.com,Janet Levy,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://westernfreepress.com/who-controls-americas-courts-creeping-sharia/,"Who Controls America’s Courts? Creeping Sharia . . . By Janet Levy 0 0
There have been multiple cases of court decisions rendered under sharia in America over the past 2-3 decades.
Recall the 2009 case of a New Jersey woman who was initially denied a restraining order after she was raped by her Moroccan Muslim husband. The family court judge ruled that the husband was operating under his Islamic belief that a wife is required to satisfy her husband’s sexual desires at all times. However, under New Jersey law, coerced sex between married couples is called “rape.” Fortunately, the appellate court overruled the decision and the woman eventually obtained an order of restraint.
In 1996, in Hosain v. Malik, a Maryland district court enforced a Pakistani sharia custody order and granted full custody to the father, even though U.S. law requires the court to consider the well-being of the child and the father was an abusive alcoholic. The appellate court ruled that in Pakistani culture, the well being of the child is believed to be “facilitated by adherence to Islamic teachings” and the child returned to Pakistan with her father.
Keeping these cases in mind, think about the beginning of tomorrow’s trial of Somali Muslim “refugee” police officer, Mohammed Noor, accused of murdering 40 year old Australian-American, Justine Damond. In 2017, she had called 911 to report the possible assault of a woman in her apartment alley. When the pajama-clad, unarmed Damond approached the police car, Officer Noor reached across his partner and shot her in cold blood.
According to a local Twin Cities contact, the judge in this case will be restricting courtroom and viewing access and include a mere handful of seats for members of the CAIR-controlled media.
With the state’s top law man – Keith Hakim Ellison – in charge, could Mohammed Noor be found NOT GUILTY or receive a mere slap on the wrist?
Today, Minnesota is essentially a sharia state and Noor could easily be characterized as a victim of Islamofauxbia. We’ve seen this play out before.
Stay tuned for more news on what could easily turn out to be yet another orchestrated CAIR/MB action; this time to exonerate a murderer.

Green New Deal as a Means to Advance U.N. Agenda 21,westernfreepress.com,Nancy Thorner,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://westernfreepress.com/green-new-deal-as-a-means-to-advance-u-n-agenda-21/,"Green New Deal as a Means to Advance U.N. Agenda 21 By Nancy Thorner 0 0 Few Americans realize that a dangerous United Nations program is being stealthily enacted in our nation’s cities and certainly our country, with the full cooperation of those in our highest positions of authority. It is so complicated and difficult to believe that many simply dismiss it, considering it just a conspiracy theory. But even a cursory investigation reveals it is very real and the evidence is easily attained.
This intrusive, all-encompassing plan that could eventually affect every aspect of our lives is known as “United Nations Agenda 21.” It’s pure communistic in nature. We all must fight against it if we are to remain a free people and nation. The Green New Deal happens to represent the boldest tactic yet toward the full implementation of Agenda 21 here in this nation.
The specific plan, United Nations Agenda 21 Sustainable Development , was a product of The Rio Conference held at Rio de Janeiro from June 3 – 14, 1992. It was to be implemented worldwide in order to inventory and control all land, all water, all minerals, all plants, all animals, all construction, all means of production, all energy , all education, all information, and all human beings in the world. As such Agenda 21 marked a new beginning for the U.N., a decisive point of departure for the world organization .
Project 21 contained twenty-seven principles warning against a mode of growth that was leading to the extinction of life on earth. Based on two fundamental ideas, development and environment, Project 21 was introduced as a cooperative task and challenge for world nations toward this goal: to establish the basic principles that must govern the conduct of nations and peoples towards each other and the Earth to ensure a secure and sustainable future.
U.S. signs on to Agenda 21
One hundred nations attended the 1992 Rio Education on Environment and Development. According to the UN information Center , all nations in attendance agreed to the document. Representing the U.S.A. was President George H. Bush (1989 – 1993), who allowed an outside entity (the U.N.) to collaborate and dictate an agenda which is already affecting our entire country and our citizens. In a news conference given in Rio de Janeiro on June 13, 1992, Bush’s opening statement included the following remarks prior to questions taken from reporters :
“Let’s me be clear on one fundamental point. The United States fully intends to be the world’s preeminent leader in protecting the global environment. We have been that for many years. We will remain so. We believe that environment and development, the two subjects of this Conference, can and should go hand in hand. A growing economy creates the resources necessary for environmental protection and environmental protection makes growth sustainable over the long term.”
First called a “suggestion” for “voluntary action”, not long after its introduction at The Rio Conference (also known as the “Earth Summit”), Nancy Pelosi introduced a resolution of support for the plan in Congress calling it a “comprehensive blueprint for the reorganization of human society.”
Presidents Clinton and Obama promote Agenda 21
With the defeat of G.H. Bush, newly elected Bill Clinton in 1993 ordered the establishment of the President’s Council for Sustainable Development , with the express purpose of enforcing the Agenda 21 blueprint into nearly every agency of the federal government to assure it became the law of the land. A year later in 1994, the American Planning Association issued a newsletter supporting Agenda 21’s ideas as a “comprehensive blueprint” for local planning.
The main weapon used by Clinton for his call for action was the threat of Environmental Armageddon, particularly manifested through the charge of manmade global warming, later to becoming “climate change.” It didn’t matter if true science refused to cooperate in the scheme, as actual global temperatures are not rising and there continues to be no evidence of any appreciable manmade effects on the climate. But has truth ever been important to scare mongers? Paul Watson of Green Peace declared: “It doesn’t matter what is true, it only matters what people believe is true.”
President Barack Obama endorsed Clinton’s efforts to have what was originally a voluntary effort for world leaders to comply to Agenda 21. Obama, believing climate change constituted an economic and security threat to the nation , signed on to the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 which pledged its nearly 200 participants to work to stem global warming. Accordingly, on Sept. 21, 2016, Obama instructed federal agencies to consider climate change when drawing up their national security plans. On the same day the National Intelligence Council (NIC) backed Obama with a report saying climate change is “almost certain to have significant direct and indirect social, economic, political, and security implications [and] pose significant national security challenges for the United States over the next two decades.”
President Trump as a stumbling block
President Trump momentarily stymied the U.N movement to advance Agenda 21 worldwide in a White House Rose Garden event on June 2, 2017, and was harshly condemned, when pulling out of the Paris Accords. President Trump has many times spoken of climate change as “a total and very expensive hoax.” On March 28, 2017 Trump declared the costs of complying with government regulations designed to limit climate change posed a greater threat to national security than did the changes themselves. Additionally, Trump rescinded Obama’s 2016 national security memorandum and many of Obama’s other climate-related directives. Trump’s aim was to end “regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production, constrain economic growth and prevent job creation.”
As to the Paris Accords, Dr. Bjorn Lomberg had the following to say in an article by Ed Hiserodt in the March 4, 2019 edition of New American:
“Even if we assume all promises (determined contributions of those signing on to the Paris Accords) are fulfilled by 2030, and continue to fulfill them until the end of the century, and there is non ‘CO2 leakage’ to non-committed nations, the entirety of the Paris promises will reduce temperature rise by just 0.7 degree C (0.306 degrees F) by 2100.
And even if Americans did stop producing CO2, Earth’s CO2 levels would continue to rise because China, India, and other countries are building coal-fired plants by the dozen, which will like more than offset any reductions Americans make.”
Green New Deal of AOC
Enter the Green New Deal, the boldest tactic yet, as proposed by AOC when the Democrat Socialists took control of the House in the 2018 midterms. The origins and the purpose of the Green New Deal are not unlike the positive-sounding objectives of Agenda 21: to protect the environment and make a better life for all of us.
In that the forces behind Agenda 21 were becoming both impatient and scared because after 27 years Agenda 21 had not yet been realized, coupled with growing apprehensive that people around the world were starting to wise up to the real nature of Agenda 21, permitted the clock of deception to be removed to reveal the true goals of the Green New Deal, socialism and global control as a way to advance Agenda 21. Still undetermined, however, is whether through congressional action the Green New Deal could be enacted into law. Presently the most ambitious climate change and clean energy policies are coming from states.
If Illinoisans like the Green New Deal championed by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortex, they will like what Illinoisans have in store for them. Illinois’s general assembly is weighing a bill — the Clean Energy Jobs Act (SB 2132/ HB 3624) — that sets an aggressive target of decarbonizing the state’s energy by 2030 and running the state completely on renewable energy by 2050. That includes deploying more than 40 million solar panels and 2,500 wind turbines alongside $20 billion in new infrastructure over the next decade. Its central goals are 100 percent carbon-free electricity production by 2030 and 100 percent renewable everything across the state by 2050. That means the 2050 goal also precludes nuclear energy!
Broadly, the Green Energy Jobs Act aligns with the Green New Deal. While the Green New Deal resolution is just that — a resolution — in Illinois the rubber might actually meet the road. According to Emily Melbye, chief of staff for State Rep. Ann Williams, a sponsor of the Clean Energy Jobs Act, “This bill is far more comprehensive [than the Green New Deal] and positions Illinois as a leader in the clean energy economy.”
Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, New Jersey, Washington State, Massachusetts, Colorado, Maine, Michigan, and Washington, DC, have commitments or are considering legislation that would put them on a path toward 100 percent clean energy.
Local community sustainable and energy policies
It isn’t only states who are determined to convert to 100 percent renewable energy. There is a direct link between U.N. Agenda 21, as introduced to the world at the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, and groups who are trying to gain control over local development and energy policies, perhaps even in your community or city? As far back as 1994 the American Planning Association issued a newsletter supporting Agenda 21’s ideas as a “comprehensive blueprint” for local planning.
In this recent article by Steve Goreham , a policy advisor to The Heartland Institute, a speaker, author, and researcher on environmental issues as well as an engineer and business executive, he writes: 100% percent renewable by 2050 – Is the Mayor of Porkopolis Smarter than a fifth Grader? , Goreham writes:
“Mayors in more than 100 US cities have announced plans to transition their electrical power systems to 100 percent renewable by 2050. They propose replacement of traditional coal, natural gas, and nuclear generating stations with wind, solar, and wood-fired stations. But none of these mayors has a plausible idea of how to meet their commitment.”
Words of Wisdom
Friedrich August von Hayek (1899-1992) Nobel Laureate of Economic Sciences, left this warning for humanity:
“Ever since the beginning of modern science, the best minds have recognized that “the range of acknowledged ignorance will grow with the advance of science.” Unfortunately, the popular effect of this scientific advance has been a belief, seemingly shared by many scientists, that the range of our ignorance is steadily diminishing and that we can therefore aim at more comprehensive and deliberate control of all human activities. It is for this reason that those intoxicated by the advance of knowledge so often become the enemies of freedom.”
As more American city, county, and state governments are duped by the global warming fanatics (alarmists) into initiating new harsh laws and removing individual freedoms, the public can no longer afford to yawn and ignore U.N. Agenda 21 and all its tentacles into our lives. 102 shares"

"On border, volunteer doctors struggle to provide stopgap care to immigrants",www.tucsonsentinel.com,Anna Maria Barry-Jester,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/nationworld/report/040619_border_docs/,"Posted Apr 6, 2019, 6:30 pm Anna Maria Barry-Jester Kaiser Health News
EL PASO, Texas — It wasn’t the rash covering Meliza’s feet and legs that worried Dr. José Manuel de la Rosa. What concerned him were the deep bruises beneath. They were a sign she could be experiencing something far more serious than an allergic reaction.
Meliza’s mom, Magdalena, told the doctor it started with one little bump. Then two. In no time, the 5-year-old’s legs were swollen and red from the knees down.
De la Rosa noticed a bandage-covered cotton ball in the crook of Meliza’s elbow, a remnant of having blood drawn. During their time at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility, Meliza had been sent to a hospital, Magdalena explained, cradling the child with her 5-foot frame. They had run tests, but she had no way to get the results. Through tears, she begged for help. “My daughter is my life,” she told him in Spanish.
The doctor would see nearly a dozen patients that March evening at his makeshift clinic inside a warehouse near the El Paso airport. That week, similar ad hoc community clinics would treat hundreds of people, some with routine colds and viruses, others with upper-respiratory infections or gaping wounds. Like Meliza, all were migrants, mostly from Central America, a river of families arriving each day, many frightened and exhausted after days spent in government detention.
De la Rosa, an El Paso pediatrician, is one of dozens of doctors volunteering on the U.S.-Mexico border as the flow of migrants crossing without papers and asking for asylum climbs to a six-year high. Unlike previous waves of immigration, these are not single men from Mexico looking to blend in and find work. Most are families, fleeing gang violence, political instability or dire poverty.
President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency on the southern border to free up billions of dollars in funding to construct a wall as a means of stemming the tide of asylum seekers. On Friday, Trump visited Calexico, Calif., to tour a section of recently upgraded fencing, saying that keeping migrants out of the U.S. was the solution for overcrowded ports of entry.
But the federal government isn’t covering the cost of the humanitarian crisis unfolding in border communities like El Paso.
In the absence of a coordinated federal response, nonprofit organizations across the 1,900-mile stretch have stepped in to provide food, shelter and medical care. Border cities like El Paso, San Diego and McAllen, Texas, are used to relying on local charities for some level of migrant care. But not in the massive numbers and sustained duration they’re seeing now. As the months drag on, the work is taking a financial and emotional toll. Nonprofit operators are drawing on donations, financial reserves and the generosity of medical volunteers to meet demand. Some worry this “new normal” is simply not sustainable.

“The care we are providing we could never have foreseen, or imagined spending what we are spending,” said Ana Melgoza, vice president of external affairs for San Ysidro Health, a community health system providing care for migrants crossing into San Diego. She said her clinic has spent nearly $250,000 on such care since November. An Emotional And Financial Toll
In October, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency drastically changed how it handles migrant releases from its detention facilities. Families seeking asylum no longer would get help coordinating travel to live with relatives or sponsors while claims were processed. Since the policy shift, thousands of migrants have found themselves in border cities without money, food or a way to communicate with family. From Dec. 21 to March 21, 107,000 people were released from ICE detention to await immigration hearings.
In El Paso, which has seen a 1,689% increase in border apprehensions of migrants traveling with family members compared with last year, volunteer doctors are staffing a network of clinics. Kids with coughs and colds, diarrhea and vomiting are common. Some migrants have severe blisters on their feet that need cleaning, or diabetes that’s out of control because, they say, their insulin was thrown away by border patrol agents.
For de la Rosa, this is just the latest work in a career tied to border health. Born and raised in El Paso, he has served on the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission since President George Bush appointed him in 2003. He was founding dean of the city’s Paul L. Foster School of Medicine when it opened a decade ago as one of the few programs in the country that require all students to take courses in “medical Spanish,” designed to bolster communication with Spanish-speaking patients.
As he entered the warehouse-turned-shelter that evening in late March, he pulled off his signature bow tie and draped a stethoscope around his neck. He thinks it’s a gift to be able to help people who would otherwise have no way to get care. “Sometimes I don’t know if I’m doing it for me or for them,” he said. “It is so fulfilling.”
But cases like Meliza’s are frustrating. (She and other patients are referred to by their first or middle names in this story because of their concerns that speaking to the news media could affect their asylum cases.)
After passing an initial screening to claim asylum, Meliza and her mother had been taken to the warehouse, where volunteers gave them food and a bed, and helped arrange travel to South Carolina, where they could live with a family member as their asylum claim proceeds.
Meliza’s rash began while they were in detention, Magdalena told de la Rosa, and four days in, she was sent to a hospital. But they were released from custody before getting the test results. De la Rosa called the hospital, hoping the labs would offer clues as to whether the girl might have leukemia; Henoch-Schonlein purpura, a disorder that can cause kidney damage; or just an allergic reaction. The hospital asked de la Rosa for a privacy waiver from the mother, but by the time he could return to the shelter for her signature, she had boarded a bus for South Carolina. That would be the last he saw of her. ‘The Best We Can Do’
Dr. Carlos Gutierrez, another El Paso pediatrician, is also desperate for communication with the doctors who work inside the detention facilities. When people are released with complicated health issues — like a man who recently showed up with a flesh-eating bacterial infection and a wound so big they could see his bone — the volunteer doctors often have to start from scratch, trying to determine what a patient has and what treatment they’ve been given.
For most of the past five months, Gutierrez has used the lunch break from his private pediatric clinic to see migrants. He works in one of several hotels being rented out by Annunciation House, a nonprofit that runs the area’s main shelter network. Support TucsonSentinel.com today , because a smarter Tucson is a better Tucson.
The organization, which is funded through donations from religious organizations and individuals, has dug deep, spending more than $1 million on hotels in the past four or five months, its executive director said at a city council meeting. It struggles to accommodate everyone — Annunciation House recently scrambled to open a temporary shelter so that 150 people wouldn’t have to sleep in a city park.
On his way to the hotel, Gutierrez reviewed the day’s text message from the organization’s director outlining how many refugees would be arriving that day: 510.
The first patients to his “clinic”— a hotel room bathroom — were 9-year-old twins from Guatemala. They were traveling with their mother, Mirian, who said she fled her hometown after local men threatened to kidnap one daughter if she didn’t pay protection money to operate her tortilla stand.
Mirian and her daughters had crossed a small river to reach what she believed was New Mexico, she said, imagining that the authorities they surrendered to would be like the U.S. tourists she’d met in her hometown. “There, when the tourists arrive, they are so nice. Even doctors come to help us,” she said in Spanish.
But it was not a warm welcome. During the six days they spent in custody, one of her daughters contracted bronchitis, she told Gutierrez. They were healthy when they entered, she said, but sleeping on cold concrete floors and eating skimpy ham and cheese sandwiches broke them down. “They treat you like you’re trash,” she said.
Mirian showed Gutierrez an inhaler she had been given in the detention facility and asked what it was for. Her other daughter had developed a deep cough and needed attention, she said. After examining both girls, Gutierrez showed Mirian how to use the inhaler. The girls would be fine, he told her, but with their lungs as congested as they were, it might be weeks before they recovered.
“I mean, this is the best we can do,” Gutierrez said, after prescribing an antibiotic to a little girl with an ear infection. “We could be doing it better. But when they are in our care, nobody is dying.” Necessary Work
More than two dozen people have died while in immigration custody under the Trump administration, according to a recent NBC News analysis . The government says it added nurses and doctors to its facilities after two children died in December. Immigration authorities are now taking 60 children a day to the hospital and doing medical screens for every child under 18, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said during a March news conference .
But many people still have serious needs upon release. When Gutierrez and his colleagues started these clinics, they were meant to temporarily fill a gap caused by the change in government policy. Asked if he thinks the volunteer work is sustainable, he shook his head and sighed. “I’m so tired.”
The financial model — relying on donations and volunteers — also has its limits. Asylum seekers generally don’t qualify for social services, including Medicaid, before they have been granted asylum. In California, negotiations are underway to make some of the $5 million in emergency funds the state is spending at the border available to reimburse clinics for care, according to the office of state Sen. Toni Atkins. Physicians in Texas and Arizona were not aware of similar conversations in their states.
Dr. Blanca Garcia, another El Paso pediatrician, has been volunteering a few days a week since October. Like many of the doctors, she cites a moral and financial argument for providing care to the migrants, who are in the country legally once they apply for asylum. These are vulnerable people who might not otherwise seek care, and for every diagnosis of strep throat, she is likely preventing an expensive emergency room visit, she said.
Still, there are limitations to what they can provide.
Cristian, 21, and his 5-month-old baby, Gretel, arrived at an El Paso shelter in a former assisted living facility early one afternoon. He’d never been alone this long with his daughter, he said. His wife — a minor — had been separated from them at the border, put in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services. Cristian didn’t know when she might be released.
While in detention, he had spent several nights with Gretel on a concrete floor in a room with more than a hundred other men, he said. He asked a guard for a better sleeping situation. Instead of receiving help, he said, he was punished by being forced to sit and stare at a wall for over an hour as Gretel cried in his arms.
Still breastfeeding before she was separated from her mother, she would suck on his nose and at his shirt. He was worried that she wasn’t getting enough to eat, and that the formula he was giving her wasn’t as good for her as breast milk. Dr. Garcia told him the baby looked healthy.
Still, Cristian was anxious, and grew increasingly distressed as he recounted their history.
“Will the baby be OK?” he asked in Spanish. Sponsorships available Support TucsonSentinel.com & let thousands of daily readers knowyour business cares about creating a HEALTHIER, MORE INFORMED Tucson

DHS employees warned not to disclose 'nonpublic information' in leaked memo,www.tucsonsentinel.com,Paul Ingram,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/040519_dhs_leak_memo/,"Posted Apr 5, 2019, 3:07 pm Paul Ingram TucsonSentinel.com
A senior member of the Department of Homeland Security warned employees not to disclose ""nonpublic information,"" and said they could face criminal, civil or administrative consequences for leaking, in an email sent out Thursday that was quickly leaked to TucsonSentinel.com and others.
In the email, first published by BuzzFeedNews, and also independently provided to TucsonSentinel.com by a departmental source, Chip Fulghum, the deputy undersecretary for management at DHS, told federal employees that ""we serve the public, and our loyalties must prioritize that purpose above all others.""
""A violation of the public trust might arise, for example, if DHS personnel disclose nonpublic information or use it for their own personal benefit, such as for monetary gain, or for the private gain of others,"" he said.
""Unauthorized disclosure or use of sensitive and protected nonpublic information derived from your position or gained in the performance of your DHS duties, regardless of whether you personally gain, can be a misuse of position,"" Fulghum said.
Fulghum defined ""nonpublic information"" in his memo, noting that this would include ""information you know or should have known has not been made available to the general public,"" as well as information that is ""designated as confidential,"" and would not be made public ""even upon a request.""
This would include information that DHS might withhold in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, as well as information that the department would disclose, ""but which is not yet public.""
The staffer at DHS who leaked the memo to TucsonSentinel.com requested anonymity to protect their job.
As part of his memo, Fulghum outlined the duties that DHS personnel had under whistleblower protections, noting that disclosures of information, including classified information and information protected by the Privacy Act, are only protected ""if they are made to the Office of Special Counsel, an Inspector General office, or to Congress, and only if the information is handled in a manner that is consistent with applicable law,"" he said. Support TucsonSentinel.com today , because a smarter Tucson is a better Tucson.
""In order to avoid or mitigate consequences, DHS personnel are reminded to notify their supervisor promptly about any inadvertent use or disclosure of nonpublic information,"" Fulghum wrote.
On Wednesday, the agency also sent out a request for volunteers to help ""frontline"" agencies — including Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement — deal with the thousands of families and children traveling without parents or guardians, who have come to the U.S. seeking asylum from three Central American countries and Mexico."
Nabor Pacheco served as Pima County's first Mexican-American sheriff,www.tucsonsentinel.com,Tom Prezelski,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/040519_sheriff_history/,"Posted Apr 5, 2019, 1:00 pm Tom Prezelski TucsonSentinel.com
We in Pima County proudly embrace our Mexican-American heritage, though this comes with an inconsistency. Since the very beginning, Mexican-Americans have been prominent in local politics, but have largely been underrepresented in elected office. As an example, of the 34 individuals who have served as sheriff since Pima County was organized in 1865, only one, a man named Nabor Pacheco, who was first elected in 1904, has been of Mexican descent. He was also the first, and, thus far the only sheriff who was a native of Pima County.
Pacheco was born in Tucson in 1863. Though his parents were immigrants from Sonora, his extended family was prominent and well-established locally, with roots going back to the 1790s. His father, Refugio, was a successful farmer who served a term on the Board of Supervisors from 1871 until his death in 1873.
Once old enough to inherit the farm, Nabor Pacheco continued the success of the family business and expanded into real-estate. He soon became prominent in community affairs as a volunteer firefighter and a founder of the Alianza Hispano-Americana, an organization that advocated for the interests of the Mexican-American community. He was active in the Republican Party and served on a bipartisan committee that advocated for the coinage of silver, a contentious issue which was more popular among Democrats.
In 1896, the City Council appointed Pacheco as an officer in Tucson’s small police force, where he quickly gained a reputation as “capable and efficient.” In 1900, he secured the Republican nomination for one of Pima County’s two constables and was elected to two two-year terms. As constable, he led the manhunt for an errant telegraph operator who was implicated in the grisly 1903 train wreck at Esmond Station. Nabor Pacheco and others Pacheco was overwhelmingly nominated for Sheriff over an unknown opponent at the Pima County Republican convention in October 1904. A month later, he was narrowly elected largely on the strength of the Mexican-American vote in Tucson.
As sheriff, Pacheco’s most reliable deputy was “Jack,” a dog who began to follow him around during his days as a policeman. Jack “jumped in and helped” during arrests and “had become so accustomed to the court house that he acted as if the building was his.”
Though times were changing, Pacheco’s job still called on him to perform his duties like the hard-riding, gun-slinging sheriffs of yore. He personally pursued a robbery suspect to El Paso, and traveled to Globe to nab a bank president who was wanted for fraud. However, he did take steps to modernize the office.
Though he did much of his work on horseback, he seems to have been the first sheriff to regularly use an automobile. The remote mining camp at Silver Bell had recently boomed, and Pacheco posted a sturdy deputy with a reputation as a marksman there. Despite this, the camp was so rough that Pacheco had to travel there himself on occasion to help maintain the peace, particularly on paydays, or to take miscreants back to Tucson. Pacheco made the trip by car, along a new road which was described as the best road in Pima County. The trip was reported to take about three hours.
One duty that Pacheco found particularly distasteful was presiding over executions. During his service as sheriff, he held two public hangings, both within a month of each other in 1908, prompting him to comment: Sponsorships available Support TucsonSentinel.com & let thousands of daily readers knowyour business cares about creating a HEALTHIER, MORE INFORMED Tucson
“It seems to me that Arizona is behind the states of the east in this respect. There they take the men to the state penitentiary and the thing is done quietly by the warden and his assistants. There is none of this disgusting and unavoidable lack of privacy which turns a hanging into a morbid holiday and kills a convict while hundreds of men and boys stare and gape at him.”
Pacheco lobbied to remove this responsibility from “inexperienced” county officials and to have executions performed in private at the territorial prison. Thanks to his efforts, Pima County had seen its last public hanging.
The sheriff had been easily reelected in 1906, earning the support of even the stridently Democratic Arizona Daily Star. However, in 1908, his once solid support in the Mexican-American community was starting to crack thanks to efforts by newly resurgent Democrats. Pacheco did not seek the nomination that year.
Upon stepping down as sheriff, Pacheco was appointed Tucson’s city marshal and chief of police (the terms were interchangeable). Pacheco personally conducted a series of raids against opium, gambling and prostitution as a part of a larger effort to show federal officials that Arizona was sufficiently civilized for statehood. Though praised for his energy, Pacheco quickly became a target of controversy. First, his son was implicated in the murder of a prostitute. Then, he found himself in a strange feud with the mayor. Nonetheless, his reputation remained intact and he retained the support of the Council. However, later that year, he lost his post after Democrats swept the city elections. He returned to his life as a gentleman farmer, managing land holdings as far away as Arivaca.
Still active in politics and business, Pacheco died unexpectedly at his home in Tucson in 1920. The fate of Jack is unrecorded. - 30 -"
Man dies at immigration detention facility in Florence,www.tucsonsentinel.com,Paul Ingram,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/040519_ice_detainee_death/,"Posted Apr 5, 2019, 12:21 pm Paul Ingram TucsonSentinel.com
A Mexican man died at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Florence, Ariz., on Wednesday.
Abel Reyes-Clemente, 54, was was found unconscious and not breathing, officials said. He had been transferred to ICE custody at the Florence Service Processing Center in February after serving time at the Maricopa County Jail for a misdemeanor conviction of driving under the influence. ICE said that Reyes had been deported five times, most recently in 2008.
On April 1, Reyes was put under medical observation after he showed ""signs and symptoms"" of the flu, officials said.
Two days later, at 6:12 a.m. Wednesday, employees at the facility found Reyes ""unresponsive and not breathing,"" and they alerted the ICE Health Service Corps medical staff. ICE employees began life-saving efforts and called paramedics, who arrived and attempted to revive Reyes, and contacted doctors at the Mountain Vista Medical Center in Mesa. At 6:33 a.m., doctors at the Mountain Vista Medical Center declared Reyes dead.
An autopsy is pending to determine the official cause of death, officials said.
The agency said that ""consistent with the agency’s protocols, the appropriate state health and local law enforcement agencies have been advised about the death."" The Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General and the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility has also been contacted, officials said.
The Mexican consulate has also been advised of Reyes' death, they said.

Three years ago, two independent health experts reviewed the circumstances surrounding the deaths of 18 immigrants held in detention by U.S. immigration authorities, and found that ""subpar care"" contributed to at least seven deaths.
In a report published by Human Rights Watch, the group said that it reviewed a series of reports created by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement regarding the deaths of detainees from 2012 to 2015 at facilities across the country, including four deaths at one maintained by a private company in Eloy, Arizona. This included reviews of reports from ICE's own Office of Detention Oversight, the group found that officials had violated their own policies in some cases, and that in others delays in care had contributed to the deaths of immigrants.
Last year, the group updated their report and reiterated their findings that ""inadequate medical care contributed or led to the person’s death,"" after reviewing 15 detainee deaths from December 2015 to April 2017. In 2017 alone, 12 people died in ICE custody at detention facilities nationwide, including those managed by ICE and private-prison companies managed under an ICE contract.
ICE also faces a lawsuit after a 19-month old toddler died in March 2018 from a series of complications at a facility in Dilley, Texas. That lawsuit unraveled a ""middleman"" contract between the city of Eloy, about 20 miles southwest of Florence, and ICE as the City of Eloy was included in the $40 million lawsuit.
ICE said that all detainees ""receive medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, and access to daily sick call and 24-hour emergency care.""
""Pursuant to our commitment to the welfare of those in the agency’s custody, ICE annually spends more than $269 million on the spectrum of healthcare services provided to detainees,"" the agency said. - 30 -"
FactCheck: Trump wrong on Mexico's migrant apprehensions,www.tucsonsentinel.com,Lori Robertson,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/nationworld/report/040519_trump_migrants/,"Posted Apr 5, 2019, 12:07 pm Lori Robertson FactCheck.org
In fiscal year 2018, Mexico apprehended 110,000 migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, and over the previous four fiscal years the total was more than 500,000. Yet, President Donald Trump said that for the “first time” in “decades” Mexico “has been starting to apprehend a lot of people at their southern border coming in” from those countries.
The Mexico apprehension figures were compiled by the Migration Policy Institute from Mexican government reports . This chart, published by MPI in March , compares apprehensions by the U.S. and Mexico of migrants from the three so-called Northern Triangle countries.
Ariel G. Ruiz Soto , an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told us MPI looked at apprehension and deportation statistics to see if there had been a noticeable change in Mexico under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1.
So far, according to statistics through February, there has been a slight decrease in those figures compared with the same time periods in the last two years of the previous administration, but, Ruiz Soto said, “the trends looked similar overall.” Apprehensions at Mexico’s southern border would be included in the Mexican government’s overall figures.
Trump, however, claimed in remarks before a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that this week marked “the first time, really, in decades” that Mexico “has been starting to apprehend a lot of people at their southern border.”
The president made his remarks when asked about his calls to close the U.S.-Mexico border.
Trump, April 2: And I’m ready to close it, if I have to close it. Mexico, as you know, as of yesterday, has been starting to apprehend a lot of people at their southern border coming in from Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador. And they’ve — they’re really apprehending thousands of people. And it’s the first time, really, in decades that this has taken place. And it should have taken place a long time ago. …
But Mexico is now stopping people coming — very easy for them to do — stopping people coming in through Mexico. Let’s see if they keep it done, if — if they keep doing that.

“Mexico has consistently been apprehending and deporting people in large numbers since the implementation of the Southern Border Program in 2014,” Rachel Schmidtke , program associate for migration at the Mexico Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, told us.
Then-Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto implemented the Southern Border Program on July 7, 2014, with the goals of improving border security and migration flows, such as through temporary visitor and worker permits, and protecting migrants, including by providing medical care.
A 2017 analysis of the program by Luis Alfredo Arriola Vega, a visiting scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy’s Mexico Center at Rice University, found there were many criticisms of the program, particularly regarding its goal of protecting migrants. Deportations “considerably increased,” the report noted, but the containment efforts “made routes more dangerous for people heading north.”
“Diverse sources … agree in pointing out that PFS [Programa Frontera Sur, or Southern Border Program] effectively hardened Mexican migration policy because of the consequences associated with increased control at or near the southern border,” Arriola Vega wrote.
We asked the White House press office for an explanation of Trump’s remarks, but we didn’t get a response. Ruiz Soto told us Trump might be referring to two arrest operations in Mexico on April 1. The Mexican newspaper El Universo reported that Mexican immigration authorities detained 338 migrants traveling in buses and 150 people on foot in the Mexican state of Chiapas, which borders Guatemala. Most of those detained were from Central American countries.
But, again, Trump’s claim “that this is the first time in decades that Mexico is apprehending people in these numbers is false,” Schmidtke told us.
“What has changed recently,” she said, “is that the number of Central American migrants entering Mexico through its southern border has increased, and in January and February of 2019 the National Migration Institute of Mexico began offering members of caravans a ‘fast-track’ humanitarian visa which allowed migrants to enter and travel freely in Mexico and afforded them certain protections.”
But the Mexican government stopped issuing those humanitarian visas in February. On March 28, the Associated Press reported that Mexico’s interior secretary said the country would launch a “containment” plan for migrants at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the narrowest part of southern Mexico.
Associated Press, March 28: Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez Cordero said the situation is complicated by a caravan of roughly 2,500 migrants heading north and fears of a much larger “mother caravan” possibly forming in Honduras.
“We are going to locate our migration installations, of Federal Police and civil protection, harmoniously and with collaboration among all the federal government agencies in such a way that we have containment in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,” she said in comments a day after meeting with U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen. “It’s going to be a big change.” Support TucsonSentinel.com today , because a smarter Tucson is a better Tucson.
Schmidtke told us: “It’s unclear what they mean yet by ‘containment,’ but it’s clear Mexico is beginning to succumb to some pressure for the United States to increase their enforcement strategies.” - 30 -"
