Magic Leaves the Lakers,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/magic-johnson-quits-president-los-angeles-lakers.html,"Today in Brexit: Theresa May Finally Won a Vote in Parliament—for Something the EU Will Reject Tomorrow Los Angeles Lakers great Magic Johnson announced Tuesday he was leaving his job as Los Angeles Lakers team president just over two years after taking the reins to revive an iconic franchise that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2013, the fourth longest dry spell in the NBA. The move to leave the team appeared to come totally out of the blue, as the Laker Hall of Famer addressed the media in an impromptu press conference ahead of the team’s season finale against the Portland Trailblazers. “I want to go back to having fun. I want to go back being who I was before taking on this job,” Magic said getting emotional at times. “I was happier when I wasn’t the president.” Magic told reporters that the public announcement came before he had even told Lakers owner Jeanie Buss. During his remarks, Magic came back to the theme that he had “more fun” outside of his current role, particularly when he “was able to be the big brother or ambassador to everybody.” The Lakers had gotten dinged by the league for Magic’s interactions with league stars that opposing teams said amounted to tampering. During his farewell, Magic repeatedly brought up his frustration with not being able to act as an elder statesman of the game whiles he was in the Lakers front office. “What I didn’t like was the backstabbing and the whispering,” Magic said without elaborating. “I have a great life outside of this. I was like: what am I doing? I’m going to go back to that.” Magic leaves a franchise very much in transition, but still far from a finished winning product. Despite the addition of LeBron James this past offseason, the young team sputtered under the new weight of expectations and failed to make the playoffs. “We’re halfway there with LeBron coming,” Magic said of the team’s progress. “I think this summer with that other star coming this team is really going to be in a position to contend for a championship with the growth of the young players.”"

Forms From the Future: Do you really need a human to do that job?,slate.com,Rose Eveleth,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/forms-from-future-request-a-human.html,"What Kinds of Bureaucracy Will We Be Complaining About in the Future? At many large companies, before you can get a new computer or server or device, you have to fill out a form that tells the company not just why you need the item but who will pay for it and who is responsible for it. But as the sorts of work that humans and machines do collapse down even further, that might change. Let’s say you’re a manager at a big box store or a fast-food franchise or even a hospital . You might also need to fill out paperwork justifying your request for an actual person to pull boxes from a shelf, check people out at a store, deliver medication, or make a hamburger . How long do you think you’ll need this human for, and who is responsible for her safety? Do you really need a human? Or could a machine do the same job for longer and for cheaper? Trying to quantify the projected length of a person’s working life can be traced back to the early 1900s in the United States. Nineteenth-century life insurance companies relied on mortality tables provided by cities and churches to calculate their policies and payouts. In the early 1900s, AT&T became one of the first huge companies to adopt the idea of a “service life” for its machinery—keeping track of things like telephone poles and vehicles and gear and trying to predict when they might fail. Today, the concept of a “service life” for a piece of equipment is commonplace, but at the time it was relatively unusual. “These graphs allowed them to predict the lives of their machinery,” says Dan Bouk, a historian and the author of How Our Days Became Numbered . They meant that the company could replace things before they were run into the ground and failed. Then, in 1927, the opportunity arose to apply the same thinking to people. The late 1920s saw the rise of pensions beyond the military in the United States. Which meant that huge companies like AT&T suddenly had an incentive to predict how much work they were getting out of their employees and how much they might be expected to pay them back once they retired. Just like with their telephone poles, vehicles, and gear, AT&T began collecting data on everything from employment tenure to wages. The company designed tables to better understand its workforce, “which they can use to predict what the service life of their various employees will be,” Bouk says. With this data, it was able to offer retirement to workers who might not have been thinking about it but who the company predicted would no longer provide enough work or efficiency to be worth employing. Today, the conflation of service life and human life is less about pensions and more about mitigating other kinds of financial risks. Gone are the days when many workers spent their entire professional career at a single company. In a world where Amazon has patented (although doesn’t seem to have actually developed) a cage to protect humans from their robotic co-workers , companies looking to get more work for less money (and trouble) are turning to machines that won’t complain or get sick or unionize. Machines usually have a higher upfront cost, but they don’t require health care or safe working conditions. The new calculation goes like this: “How likely is this machine going to be more expensive to maintain in the future compared to how likely is this worker to negotiate for better wages,” Bouk says. In a world where the value of humans has been boiled down to their ability to work, the future of asking for human additions to your office might look a lot like the way you apply for a laptop today. You’ll be asked to justify exactly why you need a human, and perhaps even use the company’s predetermined tables for what the service life of that human worker might be. How many shifts can your checkout human work before you have to provide them with health care? How many burgers can a human fry cook make before it’s statistically likely that they’ll injure themselves on some piece of kitchen equipment? How many times can your warehouse human lift a box? And perhaps your contracts will be determined by that algorithm the same way service life estimates were used to predict when a machine would become obsolete—at the end of your service life, you’re let go from the company, off to find a new job where you have to compete once again with the machines.

On-demand PrEP: Is the 2-1-1 Truvada model safe?,slate.com,Matthew Terrell,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/prep-on-demand-211-truvada-hiv-sex-safety.html,"“Born This Way” Is the Standard Story for Queer People. But for Many of Us, That Story Is a Lie. An Australian man recently made headlines as the seventh reported case, worldwide, of a failure of PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis), the groundbreaking drug regimen shown to be 99 percent effective at preventing HIV infection with daily adherence. While understandably disconcerting for users, PrEP failures are major news because they are so rare—and Truvada (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine), the drug used for PrEP, is unquestionably one of the best tools we have for stopping the spread of HIV. One notable detail of this case is that the individual, Steve Spencer (who is already undetectable and noninfectious with treatment and still an advocate for PrEP ), was following what is known as an “on-demand” version of the regimen. This prescribed schedule is also known as event-driven PrEP, or PrEP 2-1-1. Essentially, when someone knows they are going to have condomless anal sex, they take a double dosage of PrEP between 2–24 hours before the encounter, and then a single pill each over the following two days. Official guidelines in Europe and Australia allow the on-demand approach, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved it. Even so, some American doctors and health centers are already recommending the regimen to gay and bisexual men. While we don’t know the specific circumstances that precipitated Spencer’s seroconversion, it’s fair to ask: Is on-demand PrEP safe? And if so, who should consider using it? To the first question, the short answer is that research shows on-demand PrEP offering significant protection against HIV with proper usage—and it is certainly better than no PrEP at all. But researchers and doctors disagree about whether it matches the effectiveness of the daily pill approach in practice. Interest in on-demand PrEP began to grow in popularity among gay and bi men in the wake of a 2015 European study called IPERGAY . Subjects chosen because they already engaged in unprotected anal sex were told to take PrEP as-needed around sexual encounters on the 2-1-1 dosing schedule. In case of multiple consecutive episodes of sexual intercourse, participants were instructed to take one pill per day until the last instance of sexual intercourse in a given string, and then to take the final two post-exposure pills. Of the 414 subjects in the study, there were 16 cases of new HIV transmission: Two in the group taking PrEP and 14 in the placebo group, suggesting an 86 percent reduction in the incidence of HIV. Vitally, both transmissions in the group taking PrEP had stopped using PrEP many months prior to the time of transmission and were both still sexually active—in other words, they were not protected. Another ongoing study from Europe called Prevenir has found even better results. This study, now in its third year, divides 1,435 subjects into daily and on-demand PrEP use (there is no placebo group) and has thus far found no HIV transmissions in either cohort. This suggests that on-demand PrEP can be as effective as daily PrEP use and has led the study’s authors to conclude that both dosing regimens could be recommended to the public. These studies have led some American PrEP users and prescribers to experiment with the on-demand “disco dosing” schedule. But it’s worth being aware of the nuances of the science before trying it yourself. The original IPERGAY study has been criticized for perceived flaws, and some health advocates fear that doctors and users may be overestimating the efficacy of on-demand dosing. In particular, the major criticism of IPERGAY is that many of the subjects were having sex so often that they were essentially maintaining consistent levels of the drug in their body. The average subject in IPERGAY had five sexual encounters per month, which means on the 2-1-1 schema they took PrEP half the days each month. The question is: Can this data be extrapolated to someone who, say, has sex once per month and doesn’t have any consistent levels of the drug in his body? Statistically speaking, it’s possible. A sub-study presented at the 9th International AIDS Society Conference in 2017 analyzed the original IPERGAY data of subjects who had three or fewer sexual encounters a month, and thus took fewer pills. Because there were no transmissions in this group (remember, the two HIV infections were in subjects who hadn’t taken their PrEP in months), it was concluded that the efficacy rate remained consistent across casual and regular on-demand PrEP users. Combine this with the Prevenir study, which showed no transmissions, and the data points to on-demand PrEP being highly effective. But not all health professionals are rushing to recommend on-demand PrEP to their patients. According to Dr. Antonio Urbina at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, the results of IPERGAY and Prevenir seem to contradict medical understanding of how PrEP interacts with human tissue. But there are studies that assess PrEP users when they have varying levels of the drug in their body. The purpose of these tissue studies is to measure how long PrEP requires, and how many doses of PrEP are necessary, to reach maximal levels of saturation, and thus protection from HIV infection. These studies show it takes much longer than the “up to two hours before a sexual encounter” dosing schedule of on-demand PrEP to reach the safest levels. “To reach [maximal] protective levels of PrEP, you need to take it for one week for anal/rectal sexual encounters, and 21 days for cervical/vaginal sex,” says Urbina. Additionally, there are variables that can influence the effectiveness of on-demand PrEP in ways statistical models can’t take into account. In terms of sex acts, “there are degrees of risk,” says Urbina. “The highest risk is receptive anal sex [bottoming] with ejaculation.” Oral sex or penetrative anal (topping) are less dangerous. Other risk factors include having other sexually transmitted infections, which can put you at greater risk of contracting HIV, receiving semen from someone with a high viral load (i.e., bottoming for someone who just contracted HIV, and doesn’t know it, and is shedding the virus at high levels), or having rough sex that may cause tears in tissues and increase the likelihood of transmission. Beyond specific acts, some sexual situations are inherently riskier, and with those the maximal efficacy rate of daily PrEP taken for a longer period of time would be preferable. For example, if a patient was going into a situation where he might have multiple sexual encounters (possibly with internal ejaculation), like a sex party or gay cruise, Urbina would advise the patient to start PrEP as early as possible as a daily pill, and continue a month after coming back. But even that may not be ideal: Urbina says there still is not enough evidence to support “vacation dosing,” where PrEP is taken during a set period when subjects know they will be having risky sex. This is why Urbina tends to push his patients toward daily adherence to PrEP. “The choreography of of 2-1-1 is hard, because sex is often spontaneous,” he says. “Daily PrEP is preferred because it is good for any surprise sexual encounters you may have.” “But I do like studies of alternative models,” he adds. Indeed, Urbina acknowledges that even if it may not provide optimal protection, there are patients who might benefit from on-demand PrEP. For example, it’s a good option for older patients who may have other medical issues (such as kidney problems) exacerbated by constant PrEP use, but still need protection for a handful of sexual encounters every year. For others the reason may be financial, given that a 30-day supply of the drug runs on the order of $1,500 a month absent any state sponsorship, insurance coverage, or copay assistance . And of course, there are always people who don’t like to take a daily pill, often because they are very sensitive to side effects, but still have risky sexual encounters that merit PrEP. (It’s worth noting that these patients might then repeatedly experience the common start-up side effects of diarrhea and nausea that usually fade after a week of daily use.) For any of these groups, 2-1-1 PrEP is better than nothing. But what about everyone else? While studies of on-demand PrEP suggest it works effectively, there are many variables in the messiness of sex that arguably render it less dependable than the daily approach. For the majority or PrEP users, the safest, most confident approach remains swallowing that one blue pill a day."
New trailer for Disney's Lion King looks like a nature documentary (VIDEO).,slate.com,Marissa Martinelli,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/disney-lion-king-trailer-live-action-cgi.html,"The Title-Deciding Instant Replay Ruling in Monday’s NCAA Final Was Totally Insane The special effects in the new trailer for Disney’s remake of The Lion King are nothing short of dazzling. Every beetle wing, every clod of dirt, every strand of fur is rendered in immaculate detail, raising the question: Are we sure these aren’t just, like, real lions who’ve been trained to sing and dance? At any moment it feels as though David Attenborough will chime in to explain that hakuna matata means “no worries for the rest of your days.” Director Jon Favreau has pulled off this trick before with the hyper-realistic animation of The Jungle Book . But this isn’t The Jungle Book , it’s The Lion King , and there’s no real, human actor playing Mowgli to ground the special effects in reality. Fortunately, the animators make it easy to distinguish between, for example, Scar and Mufasa, even though they’re lacking the expressive faces of their 2D-animated counterparts.

Scientists capture first-ever image of a black hole with the Event Horizon Telescope.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/black-hole-photographed-first-time.html,"Why You Don’t Need to Worry About That New Drug-Resistant Super Fungus In what is being heralded as a momentous and long-awaited development in scientists’ search to understand some of the most mysterious aspects of our universe, astronomers for the first time have captured a photo of a black hole, an international consortium of scientists announced in simultaneous press conferences around the world Wednesday. OK, it’s not exactly a photo of a black hole. As remnants of collapsed stars, black holes are so dense that their gravitational forces prevent all matter and even light from escaping, which means that they cannot themselves be photographed, as they are unseeable . So this photo doesn’t tell astronomers everything they would like to know about the objects. But it does show the halo of super-heated dust and gas that swirls around the black hole at near the speed of light before being sucked in (or, more technically, it shows the effects the black hole’s gravity has on that matter, as the gravity warps the shape of space-time itself, deflecting light and creating a shadow). Beyond producing a cool-looking image, the data will help scientists learn about how gravity and light contort just at the black hole’s edge. According to the Guardian , they have already learned about the nature of the light’s bend just at the black hole’s event horizon—the point after which no light can escape. And the photo appears to confirm some of their understanding as to how the physics would work: The particles on one side of the disk appear brighter because they are being shot in our direction as the disk of gas and dust rotates. This particular black hole is an extremely massive one—it has a mass of about 6.5 billion of our suns.* It sits at the center of the galaxy Messier 87, roughly 55 million light-years away, which means the image is actually of the black hole 55 million years ago. Despite its enormous size, scientists had worried we would not be able to create a telescope powerful enough to see something so far away. The breakthrough came when a group of more than 200 scientists collaborated across eight of the planet’s most powerful radio telescopes, making up the Event Horizon Telescope. They waited for a clear sky to happen simultaneously in all eight locations around the world, syncing up each telescope with absolute precision using atomic clocks and supercomputers, and combining and comparing observations from each different telescope. According to the Guardian, the photo was taken in April 2017, and one reason for the delay was that collaborators in Antarctica had to wait until the end of Antarctic winter to send over their data. The image now represents the strongest evidence yet for the existence of black holes—something first theorized by Albert Einstein (the detection in 2016 of gravitational waves made by two colliding black holes was another particularly exciting piece of evidence). Scientists are hoping that the data taken by the EHT will prove fertile for more discovery. In the meantime, if you’re disappointed by the blurriness of the image, you might not have to wait until the next multi-continent scientific endeavor: According to NBC News , one of the major goals for the group is to use the data to make sharper images.
Correction, April 10, 2019: This post originally misstated the mass of the black hole. It is 6.5 billion times that of the sun, not 6.5 million times."

We need to admit that the black hole photo isn’t very good.,slate.com,Heather Schwedel,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/black-hole-photo-just-isnt-very-good.html,"Stem Cell Therapy Is Being Marketed to Autistic Kids. It Shouldn’t Be. It’s like the universe had a royal baby: That’s how excited everyone is for this first glimpse of a black hole , which astronomers announced Wednesday morning in D.C. The image is based on data from radio telescopes all over the world, so it’s not technically even a picture of a black hole. Black holes are, scientifically speaking, unseeable. So it’s really confusing that everyone’s acting like we have a picture of one. This is actually a composite that shows the shadow of a black hole. This may or may not account for why the black hole looks different from how scientists and Hollywood have previously imagined it: It appears as a blurry circle of fire, not unlike, as Twitter users have pointed out, a bright orange doughnut. Also a hoop earring, the letter O made of neon, a SpaghettiO, the bagel emoji, etc. I mean, it’s a circle—it could be anything! Because of the importance of this achievement—by all accounts, it’s a major breakthrough—the image of the black hole will be practically inescapable in the news and on social media certainly today, and perhaps for the rest of this week.

"Wisconsin Supreme Court race: Lisa Neubauer loses to Brian Hagedorn, ensuring Republican dominance.",slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/wisconsin-supreme-court-neubauer-concedes-hagedorn-republican.html,"Today in Brexit: Theresa May Finally Won a Vote in Parliament—for Something the EU Will Reject Tomorrow On Wednesday, progressive Lisa Neubauer conceded last week’s Wisconsin Supreme Court race to Brian Hagedorn, a staunch Republican, ensuring that the state Supreme Court will have an entrenched conservative majority until at least August 2023. The political fallout from this result is hard to overstate: The conservative majority on the state judiciary is likely to rubber-stamp the gerrymandered Republican Legislature’s extreme power grabs while approving gerrymandered maps after next year’s census. This one race essentially guarantees that conservatives will dominate the toss-up state’s politics for years to come, no matter how Wisconsin’s voters actually cast their ballots. Both candidates currently serve on the state appeals court. Hagedorn defeated Neubauer by about 6,000 votes out of 1.2 million cast. Neubauer declined to request a recount. Hagedorn will replace the liberal Justice Shirley Abrahamson, increasing the Republican justices’ majority from 4–3 to 5–2. To win a majority now, Democrats will need to defeat Republican Justice Daniel Kelly in 2020, then oust Republican Chief Justice Patience D. Roggensack in 2023. Neubauer was widely expected to win Abrahamson’s seat easily after Rebecca Dallet, a liberal, won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court by a huge margin in 2018. Her opponent, Hagedorn, lost support after local media reported that he gave paid speeches to the anti-LGBTQ law firm Alliance Defending Freedom as an appeals court judge ; claimed that a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down sodomy laws could lead to the legalization of bestiality; serves on the board of an academy that expels students and fires teachers for being gay; wrote that gay pride month is “homosexual propaganda” that creates “a hostile work environment for Christians”; and labeled Planned Parenthood a “wicked organization.” Hagedorn also represented Scott Walker when the former GOP governor refused to defend a state law granting hospital visitation rights to same-sex couples. In response to this anti-LGBTQ record, the Wisconsin Realtors Association withdrew its endorsement of Hagedorn. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which funnels money to conservative judicial candidates through the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, also pulled its financial backing of his campaign. In the last week of the campaign, however, the Republican State Leadership Committee spent $1.2 million boosting Hagedorn, a late infusion of cash that appears to have pushed him over the top. (The National Democratic Redistricting Committee spent $350,000 supporting Neubauer, though Democratic leaders, including 2020 hopefuls , were almost entirely absent from the campaign.) The race was Wisconsin’s most expensive state Supreme Court election in a decade, with candidates and outside groups spending more than $6 million combined. There are a few obvious consequences of Hagedorn’s victory. Because conservatives will now hold the Wisconsin Supreme Court until at least August 2023, there is little chance that the majority will rein in the GOP-dominated State Assembly. The conservative justices will probably approve legislative Republicans’ 2018 power grab , when lawmakers weakened incoming Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ ability to enact progressive reforms. Moreover, the court will likely allow legislators to create another partisan gerrymander after the 2020 census that entrenches GOP power for the following decade. Evers can veto Republicans’ map, but without Democratic control of either legislative chamber, he will only have so much power to limit GOP dominance. And the current gerrymander ensures that Republicans will maintain their stranglehold on the assembly through the next round of redistricting. Neubauer’s unexpected loss proves, once again, that Republican leaders simply care more about judicial elections than Democrats. After huge victories in Wisconsin’s 2018 races, liberals failed to turn out for Neubauer in sufficient numbers. Their apathy ensured that the Wisconsin Supreme Court will remain in arch-conservative hands for at least four more years."

I clicked on the event titled “RE,” and in the event details box was a message from Mrs. Sandrine Nzi, who desperately needed my help in donating her late husband’s money to start an orphanage. A noble cause, I’m sure, but I deleted the invite. (Mrs. Nzi, if you’re reading this and you really do want me to manage your funds, please get in touch again. You apparently already know my email.) A couple months later, I started getting spam messages via Google Hangouts. Unlike Mrs. Nzi’s message, these were less wholesome.Leonarda, Dmitriy, Satish, Joana, and Alyce were all cam girls who’d started group chats with several dozen people, inviting us to watch their feeds. These chats popped up in my Gmail window in the middle of the day, sometimes with NSFW photos. Thankfully, I work from home, but I imagine if I did have co-workers, they’d have questions about what I was up to on my screen. The spammers in these chats were persistent; in Leonarda’s, for instance, a user named Jose kept sending links to various cam girls’ Snapchat accounts, one of which included a gay slur. Sometimes, other recipients of the spam chats responded. Jim seemed eager to have gotten attention from a cam girl: “Tell you what Kimberly if you want let’s meet up,” he replied to the other 46 people in the chat. I was desperate to stop the constant pings. But despite my best efforts, I could not figure out how. I tried to leave the chat, but I didn’t see an option to do so, nor did I see a way to just block the spammy account. A Google rep later told me that in each chat’s settings, there is a “leave conversation” option—good news, though it’s confusing why I didn’t see it when I initially received the chat—and explained how to block the spammers. After exchanging several emails with this helpful rep, it appeared that the only way I could block my spammer was to send them a chat invite—not exactly what I wanted.* There was also no way to just block the spammy account. Finally, I found a solution: I removed every other person from one of the chats I was in. To keep it from happening again, I looked into changing my settings for Hangouts invitations. But there was no way to prevent it. If a user has your phone number or email address, Hangouts allows you to choose between two options: They can send you invitations or contact you directly. While there is a setting to block invitations from “everyone else,” a spammer who has your email or number can still send you invites.* Because I am hopelessly dependent on Google products, I tried to Google search my way to a solution. What I found instead were folks on Reddit, Google’s support site, and an Android message board describing the same problems with Hangouts and Calendar. On Quora , a guy named Brad said he even got a call through Hangouts that he suspected was a sexy spammer. These aren’t the only Google products spammers have also exploited to run their schemes: Redditors posted about location sharing requests they received on Google Maps for Android from “You Have Received a Free Prize,” which sounds like the digital equivalent of free candy from an unmarked white van. Luckily, Google’s weeded out that problem: In October, it announced it was disabling Nearby , the feature that enabled these spammy notifications. My Calendar and Hangouts spammers are on the vanguard of an arms race. The hive mind, alas, provided no good solutions to preventing Hangouts spam. But there is a small tweak you can make to mitigate Calendar spam: In your settings, deselect “automatically add events from Gmail to my calendar” so that any spam invitations won’t autopopulate amongst the things you actually have scheduled. Still, that doesn’t stop the spammy messages from appearing in your email inbox. A Google spokesperson told me that the company is “deeply committed to protecting our users from spam across our services,” pointing out that the company has options for users to report spam in Calendar and Maps and to block users on Hangouts . But even Hangouts’ blocking function only works once you’ve accepted chat requests. It won’t stop new spammers’ invitations from popping up. To be fair to Google, spam is not a straightforward problem to solve. It’s done a phenomenal job of relegating business deals from Nigerian princes and extremely wealthy widows to my Gmail spam box while making sure emails with legitimate offers still get to me. Google told me its spam filter has a 99.9 percent accuracy rate, no small feat given how spam prevention is like whack-a-mole. A 2010 paper presented at a spam conference called this a “mutual evolution of spammers and spam filters.” For instance, spammers used to send messages with all text in a photo because filter bots can’t read photos—this is the idea behind CAPTCHA. But then developers wised up to that strategy and blocked all messages their filters couldn’t read. To the casual observer, it seems inconceivable that spam could be worth it. Why put so much effort into something so obviously fake? But it turns out spam’s actually quite profitable. A 2008 study in which researchers sent out their own spam found that the “conversion rate” for penis enlargement ads—that is, the number of people who fall for messages and give spammers their credit card number—was 0.00001 percent. That sounds tiny, but it resulted in $2,731.88 worth of purchases over a month. The researchers estimated that if they’d scaled up the number of bots they used, they could make upward of $9,500 a month. (Lucky for those spammed in this study, they received an error message after clicking on the “checkout” button on the researchers’ fake website.) In some strange way, I admire the forward-thinking spirit of my Calendar and Hangouts spammers. They’re on the vanguard of this arms race. Rather than joining the crowded market of email scammers, I imagine the folks who run Calendar, Hangouts, and Maps bots are seeking out new challenges, with potentially big rewards. Good luck to them, but I’m still not clicking their invites.

Correction, April 12, 2019: This article originally misstated that there’s no setting to block invitations from users you don’t know. There is a function to block invitations from people who do not have your phone number or email address. The article also said incorrectly that there is no way to leave conversations or block users you don’t know. A Google rep later told the author that there is a way to block spammers, but it appears the only way she could block her spammer was to send them a chat invite."
The new bipartisan tax-filing bill is a win for TurboTax lobbyists.,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/turbotax-bipartisan-tax-filing-bill-win-for-lobbyists-ron-wyden.html,"We Need to Admit That the Black Hole Photo Isn’t Very Good Policy wonks have long argued that the government could make it radically easier and cheaper for most Americans to complete their tax returns each year by using one neat trick: Just have the IRS fill out the forms for them. Instead of making people slog through the spring ritual of firing up TurboTax or trudging to H&R Block, the feds would send everybody a prewritten return including all of their financial information and what they owe. Taxpayers could then choose to either approve it and go on with their lives or reject the return and complete one themselves. This idea might sound a bit like sci-fi. But many countries —Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Chile, and Spain, among them—already have this system in place. The U.S. could do it too for people with simple tax situations, since the IRS already gets our earning info directly from our employers and banks. (That’s how they check to make sure people aren’t cheating.) In the past, Democrats and Republicans have introduced legislation that would make this kind of free and easy filing system—which would likely save Americans billions of dollars and untold hours of tedium—a reality. But their efforts have been defeated thanks to intense lobbying by a coalition of tax preparation companies, which want to defend their bottom lines, and anti-tax conservative groups, which want to ensure that filing remains as much of a headache as possible. And now, depending on whom you ask, it appears that Congress might be poised to snuff out the dream of bringing Nordic-style, zero-hassle tax filing to the U.S. for good. On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed the Taxpayer First Act , an expansive, bipartisan reform bill designed to modernize different aspects of the IRS. (It was introduced by Rep. John Lewis of Georgia—as in, the civil rights hero.) Its companion in the Senate has backing from both Democrats and Republicans as well. But consumer advocates claim the legislation would effectively ban the IRS from creating any sort of a free online filing system that could compete with software like TurboTax. At least one key Democrat, citing the IRS’s own lawyers, has said that’s not the case, however. Here’s what the controversy—which ProPublica’s Justin Elliott first reported on —is about. Since 2002, the IRS has teamed up with a nonprofit industry group made up of tax software companies to provide a free online filing system for middle and low-income households. It’s called the Free File Program. People are currently eligible if they make less than $66,000. And under the agreement that governs the effort, the IRS isn’t allowed to offer its own competing free service. Currently, the government and the tax prep industry have to re-up their deal every few years. The Taxpayer First Act would effectively write the agreement into permanent law, including the part that bars the IRS from creating an alternative while the Free File program is running. Activist groups—including the National Consumer Law Center, U.S. PIRG, and Consumer Action— have argued that this would not only bar the government from creating its own no-cost product that could compete with the likes of TurboTax, but also prevent the IRS from implementing a return-free, no-sweat system like the ones that exist in Europe. But Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, says that’s not the case. On Wednesday, he announced that the IRS’s chief counsel had told him that the Taxpayer First Act would not preempt the government from developing its own public filing program. Confirmed to me by @IRSnews this morning: IRS has the authority to set up a public program allowing taxpayers to file their returns directly for free. I'll block any legislation that would change that. https://t.co/xn8cTNe35k — Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) April 10, 2019 When I asked Wyden’s staff to explain the IRS’s legal reasoning, I was told that under the current Free File agreement, the government has the right to terminate the program and create its own product, as long as it gives the industry a year’s notice. Since the Taxpayer First Act basically sets the terms of that deal in stone, the IRS believes the government would still have the right to shut the program down. Wyden has a good deal of credibility on this issue: He’s long been an advocate of simplifying tax filing, and he introduced a bipartisan bill in 2011 that would have created a return-free system. But his assurance hasn’t assuaged the concerns of consumer groups. Mandi Matlock, who is a counsel to the National Consumer Law Center, told me her group’s interpretation of the bill “hasn’t changed”—in part because its text says the government “shall continue to operate” the current Free File P rogram. In their reading, that would prevent the government from terminating it. What to make of all this? At best, the situation seems ambiguous. If Wyden wanted to clarify the situation, he could demand an amendment specifying that the IRS still had the right to create its own free tax-filing system to go up against private companies. When I asked Wyden’s office if that would be a potential solution, they responded, “Senator Wyden wants to work with his colleagues on a path forward and ensure it’s clear.” (I also asked the Free File Alliance, the industry group that works with the government, about its interpretation of the bill, but haven’t heard back). To some extent, this is all missing the forest for the trees. By any reasonable standard, the Free File Program has been a flop, and there’s no particular reason to enshrine it in federal law, especially if it might put limits on the IRS’s ability to create something better. Americans sent in 154 million tax returns in 2018. Just 2.5 million, or 1.6 percent, were submitted via Free File. That stat comes from the National Taxpayer Advocate, which recently published a blog post titled “The Free File Program Is Failing to Achieve Its Objectives and Should be Substantially Improved or Eliminated.” Part of the problem is that Free File has basically zero marketing budget. (“The IRS does not promote or advertise Free File, outside of placing it on its website,” the post notes). But it also apparently has a buggy interface. What Free File lacks in actual, demonstrable success, it makes up for mostly in lobbying support. As ProPublica has documented , tax prep companies like Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, and H&R Block are a force on Capitol Hill. Last year, they spent $6.6 billion trying to influence lawmakers. Over the last two elections, they gave $16,000 to House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neal, a Democrat who calls himself a “longtime champion” of Free File. Democrats do have good reasons to support parts of the Taxpayer First Act. For instance, the bill would bar the IRS from using private debt collectors to pursue low-income Americans who end up in arrears. (Really, the IRS shouldn’t be using private debt collectors at all, since aggressively hiring them as contractors is less cost-effective than having public servants handle collections.) But even if the bill has upsides, and may be less damaging than some of its critics fear, it still seems like a win for lobbying clout over basic, good government."
Watching Game of Thrones was a thrill. Now it’s an obligation.,slate.com,Dan Kois,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-final-season-dread.html,"On Sunday, the final season of Game of Thrones premieres on HBO. The six episodes of this eighth season culminate in the hotly anticipated series finale, which will air May 19. Must I watch them? Much to my surprise, I don’t want to. As the promotional blitz for this final season has overrun us all, I have found that where I once felt excitement for the valedictory beats of a cultural behemoth, I now feel dread. Dread! Dread like what the Army of the North will feel when they face down the white walkers and … ugh . You know. Must I watch them? I dread them! Why do I feel this dread? Well, in part, it’s because I feel fairly certain that the final episodes will be bad. The series has definitely trended in that direction in recent years, and that was while all avenues were still open to Game of Thrones. Now the show must attempt to wrap up an enormous, complicated, long-running story avidly followed by millions in a manner that is both artistically successful and narratively satisfying, a nearly impossible task. (Arguably it’s only been accomplished by two people in human history .) If the past 10 years have taught us anything, it’s that the actual pleasure of watching the end of a prestige television series cannot match the anticipation of doing so. So must I watch these six episodes, given that they will be bad? I’m sure they’ll have stirring scenes in them and fun surprises. The Mountain will get his comeuppance at the Hound’s big hands, I’m sure. But they’re also gonna blow it. They’ll pack far too much into too short a time, desperately attempting to wrap up as many loose ends as possible. They’ll also nevertheless leave too many of those loose ends dangling. Tyrion will do something stupidly out of character. The big battle will look kind of fake. Cersei’s story will be mishandled, or Arya’s, or Sansa’s, or more likely all three of them. Somewhere in Episode 4 they’ll introduce some new character, and I’ll be like, “Who the hell is that?” and it’ll turn out that he’s not new, he was important for one scene in, like, Season 2, which first aired 100 years ago. I’ll need the internet to explain what’s cool about that. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

The show’s canvas is so large, the skein of as-yet-unresolved story threads so tangled, that the likelihood of any of us actually being happy about the way the series ends is essentially nil. And yet! I must give up six Sunday nights for these episodes. Several of these episodes will be as long as an hour and 20 minutes, the precise running time of the Academy Award–winning motion picture Ida —a movie that, as it happens, features a better version of the best death scene in Game of Thrones . Must I watch? In some respects, of course, I do not must watch them. America is, for now, a free country, and I am a grown adult. At the exact moment the premiere of Game of Thrones begins, TCM will be an hour into an airing of Gone With the Wind . I also own a number of books and board games. So I could do any of those things instead. I can’t hang out with my wife or any of my friends, because they will all be watching Game of Thrones . My kids don’t watch the show; I guess I could make them stay up late and hang out with me. As it happens, because of my job, I do must watch the show. For example, the morning after the premiere airs, I am scheduled to record a podcast about the episode. I guess I could just skip it, although that would really leave Sam in the lurch. But the real question I’m asking here isn’t “Must I watch Game of Thrones ?” but “Must we watch Game of Thrones ?” All of us. Must we? It’s not like we won’t watch. To won’t watch is unthinkable. Not only because the human hunger for narrative is so depthless that to never know what ends up happening in this imaginary kingdom would be awful. (There’s always Wikipedia, a great way to learn what happens in cultural products we do not actually intend to experience .) But at this point we’ve sunk upward of 70 hours into this show, most of us, not counting all the time we’ve spent leaving virtual flowers on virtual graves and talking with actual friends at actual watercoolers. And whether or not this is the last show we all watch together , it’s definitely a show we’re all watching together. And so when something happens, as it surely will, many somethings over and over during the next six weeks—exciting things, dumb things—it would be agony not to be watching along with everyone else, our wives and friends and co-workers. It would be agony to miss it. So we must watch. (Some of us have never watched. That was indisputably the right move. Continue not watching. Undoubtedly you’re also not reading. Great. The we in this blog post does not refer to you, and this blog post is not for you.) I remember, when NBC launched the catchphrase “must-see TV” to describe its Thursday night offerings, thinking what an odd phrase that was. In a way it seemed the reductio ad absurdum of all marketing, the secret message that all advertising wishes it had the authority to deliver: not will you consume our product but you must, in fact, consume our product . Not the interrogative but the imperative. Corporations dream of achieving that level of urgency in consumers, whether it’s explicit or implicit in their messaging. Game of Thrones has achieved it. It is must-see. We must see it. Even those of us who must not see it will see it, on billboards and on Oreos and on the internet . Yes, we must watch Game of Thrones . It will fly in on wings of dragons and incinerate us all, Sundays at 9, 8 Central. "
"Lakers, LeBron and free agency: An easy job.",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/lakers-lebron-james-magic-johnson-free-agents.html,"White House Wanted ICE to Arrest Undocumented Immigrants and Then Release Them in Sanctuary Cities as a Lesson Magic Johnson resigned his job running the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night because, more or less, he thought it was too much of a hassle . The Wall Street Journal has since summed up why Magic’s time with the team, which failed to make the playoffs or even achieve a winning record this season despite having LeBron James on it, was such a disaster:
All the Lakers had to do was construct a team around him that followed the wisdom of the NBA’s crowd. They went contrarian instead. After the series of puzzling moves that overshadowed their signing of LeBron James, Johnson went on national television to defend himself.
“Everybody’s talking about ‘the Lakers don’t have shooting,’” he said in July. “Oh, we got shooting.”
They did not. The Lakers finished the season with a 3-point shooting percentage that ranked 29th of the league’s 30 teams. The Journal gets at what the worst part of this season was for Lakers fans, and really all NBA fans: Not that the Lakers struggled but that they did so in a fashion that was totally predictable even to total boneheads such as myself , surrounding James with declining players that no other team wanted, most egregiously two guards (Rajon Rondo and Lance Stephenson) who can’t shoot. It was an entirely avoidable fiasco that took place while teams like the Milwaukee Bucks and Indiana Pacers—which are located in cities that are not warm-weather capitals of celebrity and luxury lifestyle—recruited useful free agent role players with whom they subsequently won many more games than the team in L.A. did. And it deprived society of the chance to see LeBron James, who despite being old by sports standards (34) is still very good , in the playoffs in Los Angeles, which, regardless of whether you root for the Lakers, would have been a compelling event. In this way Magic didn’t just let his team down, he let America down. The good news: Whereas most teams need to balance the urge to “win now” against the need to plan for the future, James is 1) already signed with the Lakers for at least two more years and 2) a far better player, when he’s at his best, than anyone else the Lakers could add. The team has a much, much better chance of winning a championship in the next two or three years—while James is still in his late prime—than it will after he leaves or retires. James’ unique current combination of age and immense skill has blessed the team with the rare freedom not to worry, like every other team in every sport has to these days, about playing extra-dimensional prospect-and-asset management chess , and to instead to just get the guys who are obviously good at basketball at this exact moment. And they are actually set up just fine to do that. The Lakers currently have room under the salary cap to add another star alongside James, and there are a number of stars who will be available this summer as free agents. They also still have a smattering of low-salaried young players filling out their roster who, though they have some flaws, are talented and improving. Really, all the Lakers need to do is sign the first guy on this list of overall top free agents who’s willing to play for them, then sign as many of the free agents on this list of leading three-point shooters as they can before their money runs out. Of course, the team basically had the same freedom and obvious needs last off-season too, and messed it up thanks to familial and organizational dysfunction and Magic’s too-clever “flexibility” plan . A nation—nay, a world —of basketball fans can only now hope that dumb lightning doesn’t strike twice. Support our journalism

Kim Kardashian plans to become a lawyer. Can she really do it without a college degree?,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/kim-kardashian-lawyer-no-college-legal-explainer.html,"Most Americans Encounter “Diversity” in Their Workplaces—Which May Explain Why American Social Life Isn’t That Diverse In a Vogue profile published on Wednesday, Kim Kardashian revealed she’s studying to become a lawyer and aims to take the California bar in 2022. She will not go to law school. This plan, the magazine notes, is not a unique Kardashian scheme but rather a perfectly legal alternative to the typical American lawyer’s career path in some states. But is skipping law school actually something that noncelebrities do? And, more important, is it a good idea? The short answer is that very few people forgo a JD on their path to the law—but, in my view, more should. California, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington allow aspiring lawyers to study under an apprentice for several years, then take the bar exam alongside law school graduates. If they pass, they can work as fully credentialed lawyers in the state. Individuals who choose this route in California must study in a law office for four years, at least 18 hours a week, and pass a “ baby bar ” after the first year. They must pay a $150 fee to start, followed by a biannual payment to the California bar of $30. The full cost rarely exceeds more than a few thousand dollars , compared with more than $150,000 for three years at many California law schools. Why does this program exist? It’s actually a carryover from an earlier period in American history, when all aspiring lawyers “read law” rather than attend school, then took an exam to gain admission to the bar. Many celebrated attorneys of the 18 th century, including John Adams, John Marshall, and Abraham Lincoln, followed this route. In fact, the first Supreme Court justice to hold a law degree was Benjamin Robbins Curtis, who joined in 1851 (and was not one of its leading lights). The practice of “reading law” began to fade in the 1870s when law schools emerged as a more standardized alternative. The last justice to join the Supreme Court without holding a JD, the widely respected Robert H. Jackson, was appointed in 1941. Even though “reading law” remains a possibility in some states today, this route does have some major drawbacks. First, it can be difficult for would-be apprentices to find a mentor willing to work with them closely over several years. Second, the bar exam pass rate for apprentices is quite low— 28 percent in 2013 , compared with a 73 percent pass rate for graduates of an American Bar Association–accredited law school. Third, those apprentices who do pass the bar won’t be able to practice in most other states. If you graduate from law school, take the bar in one state, then move somewhere else, you can usually either transfer your exam scores or, at worst, take the bar in your new state of residence. But if you do not hold a JD, most states won’t let you practice, even if you take the bar. Put simply, if you “read law” in California, you’d better intend to practice in California exclusively. Despite these problems, I strongly support programs like California’s, and I wish more states would allow them. Law school is an exorbitant racket that condemns countless students to years, even decades, of crushing student debt. Many young lawyers fear they can only pay off this debt by entering big law, then wind up spending years in a corporate practice that is soulless at best and immoral at worst. Too many American attorneys are sucked into this vicious circle. Some burn out after toiling under abusive bosses who demand endless hours of draining, unfulfilling labor. Others adapt and rationalize their unsavory work by taking on the occasional pro bono case. No wonder American lawyers struggle with sky-high rates of substance abuse and depression . Kardashian is not going to fix this nightmare. But apprenticeships do offer a much cheaper path for law-curious Americans who don’t wish to spend a large chunk of their careers paying off a mountain of student debt. If Kardashian inspires more people to “read law” in the states that permit it, she’ll deserve credit for challenging the law school monopoly, even just a little. "
William Barr accidentally concedes his reason for withholding the Mueller report is baloney.,slate.com,Jeremy Stahl,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/william-barr-testimony-mueller-report-baloney-watergate.html,"William Barr Accidentally Concedes His Reason for Withholding the Mueller Report Is Baloney Slate 6 days ago Jeremy Stahl © Provided by The Slate Group LLC Attorney General William Barr said something he shouldn’t have. Whoops. Mandel Ngan/Getty Images William Barr testified before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Wednesday and made headlines for promising to investigate former Obama officials who began the counter-intelligence probes into members of President Trump’s 2016 campaign.
There was a lesser noticed moment of his testimony, though, that should have perked up the ears of House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler if he was listening.
During questioning from Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, Barr acknowledged that there was precedent for releasing the entire unredacted Mueller report to Congress. This contradicts what he has said repeatedly over the course of two days of testimony, in which he has been adamant that there is no way around rules governing grand jury secrecy.
The exchange in question came roughly midway through the two-hour testimony. Capito was attempting to solicit a response from Barr explaining how crazy it would be for Congress to receive grand jury information. Here’s the key portion :
Capito: We hear a cry on Capitol Hill to release the entire report. I just want to reemphasize what you stated [..] that would be a very unprecedented and damaging to just put the whole thing out there and an unreasonable request. Am I stating that correctly.
Barr: I don’t know if it would be unprecedented since I’m not really sure what happened in the Watergate situation. I know the report came out 50 years later, I think.
At this point, Capito attempted to steer the conversation back on course, Barr stuttered for a moment, and then returned to her line of argument. “It’s essentially unprecedented, I would say,” he concluded.
“Essentially unprecedented” is not “ unprecedented .” And Barr, the incredibly smart Washington lawyer that he is, noted the perfect precedent: Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski’s cooperation and sharing of confidential grand jury materials with the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate inquiry.
In that case, which Barr brought up, a “Road Map” for impeachment from the Watergate grand jury itself was released publicly last October after 44 years of being sealed by the court. However, that Road Map—with all of the secret grand jury material that it included—was sent at the time of the Watergate investigation directly to Congress for consideration.
As Jaworski wrote in his memoir, the decision to send the report to the judiciary committee at the time was “without legal precedent, but it seemed to be legally proper—if we prepared the information properly.”
Indeed, after Watergate, sending grand jury materials to Congress for the purposes of an impeachment inquiry is no longer without precedent. This is, in fact, the precise precedent that should guide Barr.
Unfortunately, the attorney general has repeatedly said he won’t be following that precedent. Instead, he has claimed—again contrary to the precedent he himself cited—that there’s likely no way around the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) against revealing grand jury information.
In testimony before a House appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday, for example, Barr said that Nadler would have to “ go to court ” if he wanted access to the full prosecutorial report. On Wednesday before the Senate appropriations subcommittee, he hedged a bit and said he would try to work with the judiciary committees in both houses of Congress to see what he could give them. But he also emphasized multiple times that he would not be able to work around 6(e).
“The category that I think is the most inflexible under the law right now is the grand jury material,” Barr told the Senate subcommittee.
The attorney general added that he didn’t think that there was any request Nadler could make that would be covered by one of the multiple exceptions to 6(e). “If someone shows me and makes a persuasive argument that it’s covered, then I’m willing to listen to that, but I don’t see it,” he said.
The statute in question, however, states that exceptions be made for any “judicial proceeding.” A district court that ruled just last week on the issue of grand jury secrecy in another case stated that the Watergate precedents still held and that grand jury information could be released to Congress in connection with an impeachment inquiry, which would constitute a “judicial proceeding.”
In accidentally revealing his legal knowledge of the governing precedent, Barr showed how hollow his position of withholding the full report from Congress is.

New Zealand Parliament Passes Ban on Semi-Automatic Weapons by 119-1 Vote,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/new-zealand-parliament-passes-semi-automatic-weapons-ban-by-119-1-vote.html,"Trump Says Voters Don’t Care About Seeing His Tax Returns. He Couldn’t Be More Wrong. Less than a month after a deadly mosque shooting by a white nationalist, New Zealand passed a law Wednesday banning the most types of semiautomatic weapons. Parliament voted 119-1 to make permanent what were temporary restrictions imposed in the aftermath of the shooting that killed 50 people in the city of Christchurch. The law covers military-style semiautomatic weapons, like the AR-15 , which used in the Christchurch attack as well as in a number of mass shootings in the U.S., including the Parkland school shooting last year. The rapid legislative change came not just in response to the tragic shooting, but the fact that the weapons used were bought legally and then modified. “I can recall very vividly the moment I knew that we would need to be here, doing what we are doing right now,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. “I could not fathom how weapons that could cause such destruction and large-scale death could have been obtained legally in this country.” The sole parliamentarian to oppose tightening the country’s gun laws was David Seymour of the right wing ACT Party. In an opinion piece , he criticized the speed at which the changes were made, and made a number of arguments that ought to be familiar to Americans who have heard it all before. “By banning all semi-automatic weapons, the Prime Minister made legal owners of such weapons pay a cost for something they had not done,” Seymour wrote. “Right now, there’s no reason to be confident the ban will make it harder for determined bad people to access dangerous weapons.” The changes to the country’s gun laws garnered widespread support, however, and did take into consideration the views of the country’s many remote rural communities. “Experts studying New Zealand gun laws say such changes had been recommended to Parliament several times but always met with opposition,” the Washington Post reports . “Four inquiries on gun laws have been undertaken by the New Zealand government in recent years, including one after a 1990 mass shooting that killed 13.” The government has established a buyback program that will run until Sept. 30, giving gun owners a five-plus month amnesty during which they can hand over any weapons covered by the ban."
Former Obama counsel Craig expects to be indicted for mischaracterizing work with Manafort in Ukraine.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/greg-craig-manafort-white-house-counsel-indicted-charged-fara-foreign-agent-ukraine.html,"Trump Says Voters Don’t Care About Seeing His Tax Returns. He Couldn’t Be More Wrong. Prominent Democratic attorney and former Obama White House counsel Gregory Craig expects to be indicted in the coming days in relation to his work with lobbyist Paul Manafort in Ukraine in 2012, his lawyers said Wednesday. Craig, who also worked in the Clinton White House, is facing charges for his work at the law firm Skadden Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, where he was a partner at the time. The firm was hired by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to review his Justice Ministry’s prosecution of a chief rival, Yulia ­Tymoshenko, which led to her being imprisoned by the regime. Skadden produced a 187-page report on the case and claimed it was an independent analysis while failing to disclose the firm was being paid by the Ukrainian government to produce it. Manafort and other lobbyists working for the Yanukovych regime spread the Skadden report widely in an effort to sanitize their guy in the face of criticism of the conviction and his record more generally. When the Justice Department queried the firm in 2012 to see whether its work on behalf of Yanukovych required it to register as a foreign agent, Craig responded in a in September 2013 letter to the DOJ saying he “in no way serving as an agent for Ukraine.” The DOJ agreed at the time, but when the Mueller investigation led to a deep dive into years of murky work by Paul Manafort in Ukraine, Craig’s characterization of his work came under renewed scrutiny by prosecutors. “Skadden in January reached a settlement with the Justice Department, admitting it should have registered for its work in 2012 and 2013, and agreed to turn over the $4.6 million in fees it made for the report in exchange for facing no criminal charges,” the Washington Post notes . “In its settlement, Skadden agreed that DOJ’s 2014 finding that the firm did not need to register came after DOJ relied on ‘false and misleading oral and written statements’ made by Craig.”"

We Asked a Professor Who Tracks Golf Bird Calls. Guava Island , a top-secret music film starring Donald Glover and Rihanna, will be released for free on Amazon Prime on Saturday morning as part of the festivities surrounding Glover’s headline slot (as Childish Gambino, the stage name he uses for his music career) Friday night at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Vanity Fair reports . The movie, written by Glover’s brother Stephen Glover and directed by Glover’s Atlanta and “This Is America” collaborator Hiro Murai , was secretly filmed in Havana last summer during a gap between Glover’s Solo: A Star Wars Story publicity tour and a fall concert tour as Childish Gambino. Said to be inspired by both City of God and Purple Rain , the hour-long, music-driven movie is a thriller in which Glover’s character attempts to throw a festival on an island, presumably the sort of island where one might find guava. Rihanna plays Glover’s love interest, and Black Panther ’s Letitia Wright is also featured.

Conan O'Brien: Andy Richter's Sports Blast is a model for digital journalism in the 21st century.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/andy-richter-sports-blast-conan-obrien-andres-du-bouchet.html,"Sports! TBS Part of our country’s decades-long jocks vs. nerds hangover is a tradition of jokes in which the comedian makes a point of not knowing anything about sports, often involving the use of the word “ sportsball .” The first time Conan ’s Andy Richter presented a segment called “Andy Richter’s Sports Blast” about a year ago, it was squarely in the middle of that stream: Richter did an impersonation of a brash, jock-gone-to-seed sports commentator who somehow knows nothing about sports, and although it had a few touches of absurdist humor, it mostly made jokes at the expense of people who care about sports from the perspective of a sports outsider. But over subsequent “Andy Richter’s Sports Blast” segments, the show’s writers layered in more and more jokes about, basically, television production: chyrons for subsegments like the “Wall of Basketballs” start invading the screen at the wrong moment, Conan O’Brien and Richter get caught in a loop telling each other “back to you!” and the recorded voice yelling “Sports!” gets more and more insistent. On Wednesday, the “Sports Blast” segment finally achieved its final form: That is a goddamned symphony. O’Brien and Richter intro Sports Blast with a sort of Oscar-presenter-banter delivery where every line is a little late, and Richter has turned down the ex-jock vibes from the segment’s initial run in favor of just playing someone with no idea what to do in front of a television camera. And adding Andrés du Bouchet as greenscreen correspondent Trey Triplethird III (!) is a stroke of genius. This isn’t just the best version of “Andy Richter’s Sports Blast,” it’s a model for what journalism could someday become. Because although it’s condescending to treat sports contemptuously, the tire fire currently raging in most other fields of human endeavor deserves nothing better. Let’s all pivot to Sports Blast!

"Julian Assange Arrested in London, Faces Extradition to U.S. in Connection With Leak of Iraq War Secrets",slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-arrested.html,"Mueller’s “Thirteen Angry Democrats” Deep State Operation Is About to Take Down … Obama’s White House Counsel? WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested by British police early Thursday at the Ecuadorian Embassy that has sheltered him for the past seven years from extradition requests. The embassy had withdrawn Assange’s asylum status, leaving him to vulnerable to arrest by U.K. authorities who were complying with an extradition request from the U.S., according to British and American authorities. Assange now faces charges in the U.S. “in connection with a federal charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion for agreeing to break a password to a classified US government computer,” according to the Justice Department . The charges relate to his role in the 2010 publication of a trove of Iraq War documents and diplomatic cables leaked by Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning—what the DOJ called in its press release “one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States.” In a court document unsealed Thursday by federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia, prosecutors allege Assange “engaged in a conspiracy” with Manning by helping her crack a password stored on Defense Department computers connected to a network only used for classified documents and classified communication. The DOJ also said in the press release that Assange urged Manning to find more documents for him to publish. Assange is charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion and faces a maximum of five years in prison. In the U.K., Assange faces charges of “failing to surrender to the court” for extradition stemming from a 2012 rape inquiry in Sweden, which has since been closed without formal charges against Assange. According to the Guardian , the Swedish news site Expressen is reporting that a lawyer who represents one of Assange’s accusers in Sweden has submitted a request to have the preliminary investigation into the case resumed. Assange pleaded not guilty to the charges of skipping bail, according to the BBC . He faces up to a year in prison in the U.K. Assange has been under investigation in the U.S. for potentially more severe crimes, such as espionage, the publication of sensitive government documents, and coordination with Russia. WikiLeaks released thousands of stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and from John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, during the run-up to the 2016 election in what some have considered an act that may have swayed the outcome of the election. Intelligence officials later determined that Russian hackers, under the supervision of the Russian government, had obtained the emails. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation found that Russian military intelligence officers had discussed releasing those emails to WikiLeaks at a time that would do the most damage to Clinton’s campaign. But Assange’s potential extradition appears related only to the charges stemming from the 2010 leak of Iraq War secrets. Manning served seven years of a 35-year sentence in prison on espionage and other charges until President Obama commuted her sentence in January 2017, but WikiLeaks itself was saved by First Amendment press protections. (Manning was jailed again last month for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks and Assange.) Since the leak, the Department of Justice had continued to weigh the possibility of charging Assange. Although the Obama administration decided to avoid setting a precedent that could curtail press freedoms, the Trump administration, which has been more zealous about prosecuting leaks and appeared to have set up the argument that WikiLeaks is not a journalistic organization, is now charging Assange for his alleged role in helping Manning steal the documents, not for publishing them—a notable difference for those concerned about press freedoms. In November, a court filing for a separate case accidentally revealed that Assange had been charged under seal. A judge in the Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Thursday found Assange guilty of breaching bail and referred him to Crown Court for sentencing, calling him a “narcissist who cannot get beyond his own selfish interest.” His extradition hearing is scheduled for May 2. U.S. officials confirmed to the Washington Post that extradition papers have already been prepared. Carlos Poveda, Assange’s lawyer in Ecuador, told ABC News that he believed the arrest violated international conventions on human rights. Earlier this month, Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno accused WikiLeaks of leaking personal information about him and intercepting phone calls and private conversations, according to the Associated Press . After Assange’s arrest Thursday, Moreno released a video statement in which he denounced “the discourteous and aggressive behavior of Mr. Julian Assange” and explained that his behavior and “the hostile and threatening declarations of its allied organization, against Ecuador, and especially the transgression of international treaties” had led to the country’s decision to withdraw asylum. He specifically cited the leaking of documents from the Vatican in January in his condemnation of WikiLeaks’ meddling in other states’ affairs. Assange’s relationship with the Ecuadorian government had long been reported to be rocky , and for almost a year there had been talk of the government withdrawing asylum. In response to the news, WikiLeaks has reasserted on Twitter that Assange was acting as a journalist and is being unfairly persecuted. “This man is a son, a father, a brother,” WikiLeaks said on Twitter . “He has won dozens of journalism awards. He’s been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year since 2010. Powerful actors, including CIA, are engaged in a sophisticated effort to dehumanise, delegitimize and imprison him.”"
Louisiana church fires: Deputy sheriff's son arrested for alleged arsons of historically black churches.,slate.com,Aaron Mak,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/louisiana-historically-black-church-fires-arrest-arson.html,"For the Anti-Abortion Far Right, Six-Week Bans Are Just the Beginning Louisiana authorities arrested 21-year-old Holden Matthews on Wednesday night in connection with a series of three fires allegedly set at historically black churches in St. Landry Parish over the course of 10 days. Matthews, the son of a St. Landry Parish deputy sheriff, faces charges of simple arson for each fire. Police allege Matthews struck St. Mary Baptist in Port Barre on March 26, the Greater Union Baptist Church on April 2, and Mount Pleasant Baptist in Opelousas on April 4. The fires brought down walls and reduced much of the churches’ interiors to rubble, though no one was hurt. Investigators say they found “ suspicious elements ” in each case. They have declined to identify a motive. The FBI and the ATF have been assisting local law enforcement in the investigation . There was also a fourth fire, which investigators believe had been “intentionally set,” at a predominantly white church in a parish three hours away on March 31, but it is unclear whether this case is connected with the others. St. Landry is a rural area in Louisiana with a population that is 56 percent white and 41 percent black. The pastor at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, the Rev. Gerald Toussaint, told the New York Times that relations between black and white people in the parish were generally good. Pastors in the area have reportedly taken to installing security cameras and sleeping in their churches, or in cars outside their churches, as precautionary measures. The NAACP released a statement on the fires, which read in part, “The spike in church burnings in Southern states is a reflection of the emboldened racial rhetoric and tension spreading across the country.” Black churches have long been the target of racist domestic terrorism in the form of bombings, arson, and armed assaults. Based on the most recent data available, hate crimes in the U.S. have been on the rise in recent years. The FBI reported 7,175 hate crimes in 2017, a 17 percent increase from 2016, making it the third year in a row that the number of such incidents has increased. "

Susan Collins for Reelection in Maine, a Key Battleground State On Wednesday, Attorney General William Barr told a congressional committee in vague terms that he planned to investigate whether the FBI engaged in improper “spying” on the 2016 Trump campaign. Barr’s comments seemed like pandering to the conspiratorial remarks his boss, Donald Trump, has made and continues to make about the FBI’s Russia inquiry, which eventually came to be led by Robert Mueller’s special counsel team; the president has characterized that investigation as a “treasonous hoax” perpetrated by “angry Democrats” and highlighted by Barack Obama’s order to wiretap Trump Tower . (There is no evidence that Obama or anyone else wiretapped Trump Tower. I’m sorry I always have to write these tedious parentheticals about things the president says.) In other Mueller news, news reports say that an indictment related to the special counsel’s work is expected to be filed shortly in Washington federal court against an individual named Greg Craig, who was … Barack Obama’s White House counsel. ( Update, 3:45 p.m.: Craig was indeed indicted on Thursday.) The backstory is that Craig, after leaving the White House in 2010, joined the law firm Skadden Arps, where he later was involved in the preparation of a 2012 report about Ukrainian politician Yulia Tymoshenko that was commissioned by a rival politician, Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych also employed Paul Manafort as an adviser, which is how Mueller became interested in Skadden’s report; this January, the firm admitted in a settlement that it had failed to properly disclose its Ukraine work as required by the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The Department of Justice has now charged Craig with two counts of making false statements with the intent of evading FARA requirements. (An attorney for Craig says he is not guilty of any crime.) Will the indictment of Barack Obama’s actual government lawyer because of work done by Republican prosecutor Robert Mueller dissuade Trump and his enablers in right-wing media from continuing to claim that the special counsel investigation was a scam hoax created by Obama loyalists deep inside the government legal apparatus to target Donald Trump for partisan reasons?"

Elizabeth Warren's $6 million shows she's not doomed.,slate.com,Josh Voorhees,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/elizabeth-warren-momentum-fundraising-coverage.html,"Trump Says Voters Don’t Care About Seeing His Tax Returns. He Couldn’t Be More Wrong. Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced on Wednesday that her campaign had raised roughly $6 million during the first three months of 2019—a total that, like nearly everything at this point in the campaign , is largely a matter of perspective. It was middling compared with her rivals’ hauls, but a veritable bonanza when viewed through the lens of what were exceedingly low expectations . To use a technical political science term, then, Warren’s total was fine —enough to keep the lights on for the foreseeable future, but not enough to fundamentally change her current position in the second tier of credible candidates who are bunched up behind the favorites. Fine , however, is all Warren needs right now. Despite the doomsaying about her relatively lackluster showing in the early polls, the reality is that there hasn’t been all that much movement to date for anyone other than Pete Buttigieg ( and even then only if you squint ). There’s Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders way out in front, and then there’s everyone else. Warren’s first-quarter total is unlikely to change that, but it should be enough to fend off the She’s doomed narrative that was threatening to take hold following a New York Times story late last month about her early fundraising struggles. That kind of perception can become a self-fulfilling prophecy—a rough first quarter would have dogged her on the trail while also giving her fans second thoughts about cutting a check to her campaign. More importantly for Warren, her not-bad, not-great fundraising total will allow her to return to what she does best: rolling out bold new policy proposals that have increasingly won her praise from pundits, politicos, and political journalists, including myself . The general mood of the media is impossible to quantify, but there’s been a noticeable burst of opinion writers at mainstream outlets singing her praises and rallying to her defense—in both direct and indirect ways, and often with research to back up their points. This week alone: The Atlantic’s Peter Beinart argued that Warren is suffering from the “double bind” dynamic that makes it difficult for female candidates to be seen as both competent and inspirational. The New York Times’ Jill Filipovic took issue with gendered campaign coverage more broadly, arguing that women like Warren are unfairly seen as “too young and inexperienced right up until they are branded too old and tedious.” And the Washington Post’s David Byler made the case that Warren still has plenty of time to break out—a piece that came just days after a news story in the same paper vouched for Warren’s policy chops. There’s been a similar thing happening on Twitter as well, with journalists like Vox’s Matthew Yglesias singing her policy praises, the Post’s David Weigel touting her as an underrated campaigner, BuzzFeed’s Darren Sands noting her growing support among black women, and FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver dubbing her a “scrappy underdog who is slowly gaining momentum with high-information voters.” Twitter is not the real world, as this week’s saying goes , but it can serve as an early predictor of the coverage to come, which can have a bearing in the real world. Warren’s slow start was due, in part, to her misguided decision to release her DNA ancestry results late last year, which then fed into the unhelpful discussion about her likability and electability, two questions that are at best silly and at worst unfair to any candidate who doesn’t look like past occupants of Oval Office. But there’s some limited evidence that Warren has already started to weather that storm by churning out one big policy proposal after another. According to Northeastern University’s Storybench project —which tracks the tone and content of a small subset of campaign coverage—the five most-read news outlets were fixated on the Cherokee ancestry controversy in their coverage of Warren in February, but devoted far more of their attention to her policy proposals in March. That’s a trend that is likely to continue. Following her fundraising announcement, for instance, Warren unveiled an ambitious new plan Thursday to hike taxes on the largest, most profitable U.S. companies. “The proposal comes,” as Politico put it , “as Warren has established herself as the policy maven of the Democratic presidential primary.” Winning the Policy Primary won’t earn her any delegates, but neither will anything else between now and Iowa.

How Game of Thrones lost interest in Tyrion Lannister.,slate.com,Inkoo Kang,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/tyrion-lannister-game-of-thrones.html,"Is CBS Piping Fake Birds Into Its Masters Coverage? We Asked a Professor Who Tracks Golf Bird Calls. When we last saw Tyrion Lannister on Game of Thrones , in the final episode of Season 7 (nearly a year and a half ago!), he was lingering in the shadows, his shoulders slumped in disappointment as he watched his queen, Daenerys Targaryen, and their ally Jon Snow engage in some rather enthusiastic accidental incest. Sidelined, desexualized, and overcome with worry, Tyrion’s was a position more familiar to the castrated spymaster Varys—not coincidentally the figure the black-sheep Lannister had spent the most time with for the past two seasons as the pair crossed continents in search of Daenerys’ favor. Tyrion once loomed largest among the HBO drama’s approximately 17 million characters, serving as the show’s default protagonist (and garnering the actor who plays him, Peter Dinklage, three Emmy wins, another four nominations, and a Golden Globe). But that brief moment in the finale seemed to confirm the second-banana status of Daenerys’ recently promoted hand. How did the fan favorite—the character most beloved by author George R.R. Martin himself—lose his place in the spotlight? And is Game of Thrones better for that loss? It’s easy to see why Tyrion became the show’s first breakout character. We were always meant to identify with the youngest Lannister, an aristocratic dwarf whose out-of-placeness in Westerosi society made him an underdog hero. Weak but wealthy, smart but softhearted, Tyrion’s ever-variable status was a microcosm of the instability of the Seven Kingdoms. It’s hard to understate how radical the character still is in terms of the representation of little people, as Dinklage—one of the few known actors in the cast upon the show’s debut—threw every ounce of sexual charisma and merlot-dry wit he had at the screen. Above all, Tyrion was instantly worth rooting for on a show that became infamous for its brutality (or, some might rightly argue, its sadism), because he offered hope that just because a person came from this bleak place didn’t mean they had to be of it. He refused to sleep with Sansa after their forced marriage in Season 3. He’s one of the few royals who spares a thought for the common people as fellow human beings. And he slapped Joffrey—more than once!—thus giving the audience what we most craved at the time. But as every nattering no-name whose violent opportunism leads to their bloody downfall can attest, Game of Thrones does not have a lot of character types. The storylines and roles that made Tyrion so beloved were replicated in later seasons, often with far more depth. After setting up his younger brother with a prostitute when they were teens (with the woman posing as the victim of a crime who Tyrion would help “rescue”), Jaime turned out to be the show’s most tragic romantic. And Jaime’s surprisingly tender friendship with his former captor Brienne of Tarth supplanted Tyrion and Bronn’s contentious alliance as the series’ most memorable buddy-comedy pairing. A survive-at-all-costs Cersei has emerged as the Lannister whose death we’ll mourn most (don’t @ me), while bookish Samwell Tarly took over as the nerdy male-audience surrogate who gets with girls far more conventionally attractive than he is. At the end of Season 4, Tyrion accomplishes what he’s seemed destined to do from birth: killing his dick of a dad, Tywin Lannister. Game of Thrones hasn’t given him much to do in the three seasons since. His adventures with Varys abroad turned out to be a wan sequel to his swashbuckling with sellsword Bronn, whose transactional friendship constantly tested the limits of what Tyrion could buy with his family’s money. His long-awaited meeting with Daenerys led to a new role in the fight for the Iron Throne, but his military tactics, which saved King’s Landing from Stannis’ invasion in Season 2’s Battle of the Blackwater, cost the Dothraki queen several crucial allies by Season 7. Meanwhile, botched attempts at levity, like the scene in which Tyrion teaches Grey Worm and Missandei how to make a joke, have only underscored how alarmingly underdeveloped the show’s darker-skinned characters are and always have been. Even Dinklage’s rakish charm is no match for the Daenerys Narrative Prison of Waiting Around Doing Nothing in an Intriguingly Angular but Implausibly Empty Set and Occasionally Visiting Her Dragons (aka the DNPWADNIAIESOVHD).

Dinklage’s ability to sell Tyrion as a boozer and a whorer has always been about as believable as his mushy English accent; he has too intellectual a mien for that. (“I drink and I know things” feels about half right.) The Lannister’s DGAF libertinism has always struck me as that of a poor rich boy putting on an act, like a trust-fund kid who never showers to show everyone how real he is. Still, after his act of patricide, it would have been more fitting to see Tyrion live out the rest of his years as an anonymous barkeep in sunny Dorne, laughing to keep from crying when a traveling troupe of actors reenact his family’s many tragedies as farce. Sure, he’s still got things to teach Dany, like when he reminds her, “Killing and politics aren’t always the same thing.” But if we want modern enlightenment to win out over medieval superstition in the end, Tyrion’s partnership with the seemingly unstoppable Daenerys isn’t going to make the crusade for those values any more suspenseful. At this juncture, it seems like the show might have felt tauter, and no less resonant, if we’d seen as much of the post-Tywin Tyrion as we have of Hot Pie. Game of Thrones once sought to subvert heroic tropes: Ned Stark set up his own execution because he was too much of a Good Guy. Tyrion’s rise on the show fit that project; he wasn’t morally conflicted enough to be an antihero, but he certainly validated, if not glamorized, beta-male softness. But with humanity’s survival at stake, the show has realigned its priorities, and anyone without an army at their disposal is relegated to also-ran. Tyrion’s once-distinct mix of radical empathy and bright-eyed ambition now seems perpetually shrouded in the shadow of Daenerys’ dragons. He’s strived for heroism, but heroism no longer has a place for him. "

My Hungry Cat Is Ruining My Mornings. How Can I Stop Her Pre-Dawn Wailing?,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/cat-hungry-wails-whines-cries-mornings.html,"Dear Beast Mode: I’m Moving Cross-Country With My Cat. Should We Fly or Drive? Dear Beast Mode, I have a 13-year-old cat who has grown increasingly vocal with me as she has aged. She is a food-centric little beast (she’s on a diet to keep her at a reasonable weight), and she is extremely loud before both of her feeding times. On the weekdays, I need to get up at 6:15 a.m., but I love to sleep in on the weekends. This is something Princess doesn’t quite appreciate.Of late, the weekends have become a nonstop cryfest until I wake up, and when I recently locked her out of my room as punishment, she howled for an hour outside and scratched at the door. Am I doing the wrong thing by locking her out of the room when she cries this way? Is there any possible way for her to understand the concept of the weekend? —Early Cat Gets the Whine Dear Early Cat Gets the Whine, Cats don’t have weekends. Now, I know what you are thinking: If that’s the case, then why does Garfield hate Mondays? Garfield creator Jim Davis actually explained this during a 2014 interview :
Garfield does not have a job, Garfield does not go to school, and every day is the same. Nevertheless every Monday is just a reminder that his life is the same old, same old cycling again, and for some reason, even though his life is pretty much the same every day, on Mondays specifically, awful things tend to happen to him physically. It’s a very fun cartoon. Princess doesn’t suffer the same existential misery as Garfield. She has a pretty nice life, and she certainly has no qualms about letting her personal chef know when it’s time to eat. You may not be able to get her to read a calendar, but there are a few steps you can take to quiet things down on weekend mornings. Princess is probably having some trouble adjusting to her new diet. Changing a pet’s behavior usually involves lots of patience. These issues are often deeply ingrained, so quick fixes are rare. Luckily for you and Princess, this particular problem can be solved without needing to address her behavior, and it’s all thanks to robots. “What I would do is purchase a timed feeder,” certified feline behavior consultant Ingrid Johnson tells me. These devices automatically dispense food into a bowl, and Johnson recommends putting one far away from your bedroom on weekends and setting it for Princess’ normal breakfast time. “The cat will hear the feeder pop open and then run to the opposite side of the house to eat. And they didn’t have to wake Mom up to make that happen.” Easy! If you want to spend the money. You can find some models on Amazon for about $40, though it’s possible to spend more than $200 on an automatic feeder. But if you’d rather not invite a cat-feeding robot into your home, there are other ways to wean Princess off her morning schedule. Just keep in mind that it will have to happen gradually. “If the work schedule during the weekdays allows it, she can start inching out her morning feeding schedule,” Johnson says. “For example, do a couple of other things first before feeding the cat. Eat breakfast, drink your morning coffee, get ready for work, and then feed her, so you’re pushing back that time.” This is a simple solution, though Johnson acknowledges that delaying the cat’s breakfast by half an hour might not revolutionize your weekends: “I know for me, personally, that’s not sleeping in.” Princess is probably having some trouble adjusting to her new diet, which may account for the screaming. “Some of it may be habit, just to wake Mom up and get attention,” Johnson says. “But if it’s truly food-related and hunger, then we might be restricting and meal-feeding too strictly.” Talk to your vet about the possibility of leaving food-dispensing toys around the house while you are gone as a way to space out her meals and keep her occupied during the day. It’s also wise to check for any medical issues, as her whining could indicate an underlying issue. “Thyroid disease can make cats hungry and obnoxious,” Johnson says. Otherwise, give that automatic feeder a try. The device may save your weekends. If only there were a machine that could cheer Garfield up. "

Public Enemy No. 1: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was indicted today in London, ending a standoff of nearly seven years at the Ecuadorian Embassy. He was charged not with what he’s best known for—publishing sensitive government documents—but with conspiring with Chelsea Manning to hack the Defense Department computer network. As Fred Kaplan puts it, Assange is “ having his Al Capone moment .” What’s beef? Pete Buttigieg recently denounced Vice President Mike Pence’s history of anti-gay policies, to the surprise of the Pence family and political journos of all stripes, one of whom called these remarks “Trumpy.” But it’s not Trumpy if it’s true.

"Today in Brexit: With deadline extended, Parliament heads out for recess.",slate.com,Joshua Keating,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/today-in-brexit-deadline-extended-parliament-recess.html,"Democratic Leaders Are Absolutely Positive That Everything’s Perfect, Why Do You Ask? Thanks to Wednesday’s compromise in Brussels , the U.K. won’t be crashing out of the European Union on Friday without a Brexit deal. British leaders still have a lot of decisions ahead, and the way forward is no more clear than before. Today in Parliament: There’s one reason for even the most hardline Brexiteer MP to celebrate the six-month extension: It means they get to go on recess ! The recess, which starts tomorrow, might have been canceled if members still needed to hammer out a deal or cope with the fallout of a no-deal Brexit, but for now, they’ll have until April 23 to rest, relax, and plot coups against Theresa May. May returned to London to brief Parliament on the “flextension” the EU had granted and urged her colleagues to “use the opportunity of the Recess to reflect on the decisions that will have to be made swiftly on our return after Easter. And let us then resolve to find a way through this impasse.” The new Brexit deadline is Oct. 31, but under the terms of the extension, it can still happen sooner if Parliament would finally agree to pass May’s withdrawal agreement, which MPs have now rejected three times. May wants this to happen by this summer, so that the U.K. doesn’t have to participate in EU Parliament elections, but preparations for those elections are beginning anyway . Calls for a new referendum on Brexit are also growing now that there’s actually time to organize one before the deadline. During Prime Minister’s Questions, May batted away reports that there’s been little headway in her cross-party talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying the two sides have substantial agreement on whether to keep Britain in a customs union with Europe, Labour’s main condition for supporting the withdrawal agreement and something which Brexiteers vehemently reject. She also refused to rule out asking for yet another extension and rejected one Tory MP’s call for her to resign. The Guardian’s Andrew Sparrow notes that “in the Commons the Brexiter response was close to subdued,” considering the tumult that was supposedly going to break out if Brexit wasn’t delivered. Maybe everyone’s just ready for a break. Today in polls: Several recent polls show Labour now solidly leading the Conservatives. Local elections on May 2 could turn into a referendum on the governing party’s failure to deliver Brexit. Paul Waugh of HuffPost UK suggests that the Liberal Democrats, rather than Labour, could end up being the big winners in that vote. Today in What is Emmanuel Macron’s deal? The French president reportedly annoyed his fellow European leaders during Wednesday night’s dinner/debate in Brussels, when he insisted on speaking last and launched a one-man crusade to prevent the long Brexit extension of nine to 12 months that the other 26 leaders favored. Macron was unconvinced that the May-Corbyn talks would bear fruit and worried that Britain would play the role of spoiler if it stuck around in the EU Parliament too long after declaring its intention to leave. The Guardian reports that German officials were “very irritated” with Macron’s grandstanding. Macron tweeted on Wednesday that the Brexit distraction should be dealt with quickly since “we have a European renaissance to lead,” which is now going to be my default excuse for leaving any meeting that goes too long. Today in Today in Brexit: With the deadline extended and Parliament going on recess, the pace of Brexit news is likely to slow quite a bit, so we’re going to stop publishing this column on a daily basis.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was handed over to British authorities in London early Thursday morning. Once a self-styled freedom of information fighter, love him or hate him, Assange’s legacy has grown far more complicated since the 2016 election when Assange’s WikiLeaks apparatus operated as a clearinghouse for hacked information passed along from Kremlin-linked sources. Hacked DNC and Clinton campaign emails, for instance, were in effect laundered through WikiLeaks and then injected into the bloodstream of the American electorate. Trump knew the value—and potentially the source—of the information leaked to his benefit. But when asked about Assange’s arrest, the president clammed up.“I know nothing about Wikileaks. It’s not my thing,” Trump told reporters. “It’s not my deal in life.” That, of course, is not true. During the campaign, WikiLeaks was candidate Trump’s main squeeze and he its most high profile booster.

I masturbate while I listen to my neighbors having sex. Is that bad?,slate.com,Stoya,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/neighbor-sex-sounds-thin-walls-masturbate-advice.html,"My Wife Cheated—and Let Him Do Something She’d Never Let Me Do Dear How to Do It, I live in an apartment with stereotypical “thin walls” and with frequently noisy neighbors. This isn’t a complaint. I actually enjoy hearing them have sex and commonly masturbate while listening. I recently had a friend over, during which time we overheard the neighbors going at it. My friend commented that it must be so annoying to have neighbors like that, but I confessed that I enjoyed it and would sometimes masturbate to it. My friend was very offended by this—she thought it was a massive invasion of the neighbors’ privacy and equated it to hiding in their closet. My belief is that since the neighbors would understand the limited soundproofing of the building, they then concede the right to auditory privacy when they’re very loud. So as long as I am within the confines of my own apartment and not trying to actively record them or use some sort of sound-enhancing equipment, I have not invaded anyone’s privacy. Have I overstepped, or am I in the clear? —Won’t You Be My Neighbor Stoya : So I kind of just love this letter writer? Rich : Me too. Stoya : I feel like if anything the friend is projecting her own privacy or moral panic. Rich : If we take the reporting here as 100 percent accurate, the friend said “It must be so annoying to have neighbors like that.” Like what? Human? Capable of sexual pleasure and not caring if the people next door know it? I’ve got news for the friend: Those types are everywhere. Her house is surrounded. It’s like Night of the Living Dead , but with fornication. Stoya : Exhibitionists gonna exhibit and voyeurs gonna voye—which is absolutely not a word. Through some lucky happenstance, a pair that likes being loud lives next to someone who likes listening. It’s serendipity. Rich : Yes, a symbiotic relationship, like those fish that clean sharks’ teeth and don’t get eaten. Nature finds a way even in urban development. I feel like the writer, whose side I am on 100 percent, is really economical? Instead of turning on their computer, they’re just using the world around them to get off. Her house is surrounded. It’s like Night of the Living Dead , but with fornication. Stoya : They’re being truly green. Recycling the byproducts of others’ copulation. Rich : Look: Living on top of each other the way urban dwellers do can suck for reasons touched on in this very letter: namely, the lack of privacy. But to put it in perspective for a naysayer: If someone’s baking smells waft into your apartment, you might salivate. You might not be able to help that. If you get turned on from hearing sex that you have absolutely nothing to do with that would be going on with or without you, the same thing might happen. What can you do? Stoya : A delivery guy casually commented on how good the hallway smelled because of someone’s baking like two days ago. So that’s presumably a normal thing? Rich : It’s a totally normal thing. We overlap a lot in these close quarters, and it creates such resentment. Here’s the rare positive thing to come from living on top of one another. If more people were into the sex sounds of their neighbors, a place like New York might actually be friendlier. More people would be relieved, and presumably relaxed, at least. Stoya : We could heal the world with the sounds of sex. On the privacy question, where to draw the line, I can see where a problem might come in here. For instance, if this person were using sound-enhancing equipment, or if they were expressing gratitude to the loud couple, that might be different. Rich : Oh yeah, I agree. Recording it would be messed up, too. It almost has to happen exactly as it’s laid out—something un-ignorable and not conjured by the person who is enjoying it. It seems that this is something the letter writer is at the mercy of, much like weather, and that when their neighbors start to bang, it’s like 77 and sunny with no humidity. I guess the flip side, though, is how much responsibility do the neighbors have here? The person behind the other wall may not be as amused as our letter writer. Stoya : I’m just now, after 15 years of adult apartment sex, realizing that I had neighbors. Oops. Rich : Honestly, that’s the way to do it I think. That is how to do it, precisely, in fact. In big cities, it’s like, just part of the ambience. There are limits on how loud you should be at all hours, like anything else, but that’s it. Really, sometimes I worry I’m not loud enough! And that my neighbors are judging me like, “God, I guess he’s not getting any.” I’m just tender and passionate!!! Stoya : I’m imagining a world where neighbors do welfare checks when they aren’t hearing sex noises. It’s really great: Sex work is totally legal. Condom dispensers are on every street corner. You can get PrEP over the counter at Walgreens. Rich : Utopia. Stoya : This fantasy land rocks. I’m wondering what our writer should do regarding their friend. Rich : I think just don’t share stuff about sex with the friend. She doesn’t get it. Stoya : Simple, yet effective. Rich : Do you think there’s any getting through to her? Stoya : Probably not, or at least not until she’s calmed down. Rich : I think the only other potential issue to entertain briefly is whether our writer should alert the neighbors that they can hear them (or even that they’ve been listening). But like you said, I think they shouldn’t. Don’t disrupt the ecosystem. Stoya : I say absolutely not. If it were me—and let’s be real, it probably has been—I’d feel invaded because they said something. Or uncomfortably seen. Rich : Exactly, and it’d be terrible for the bystander to interfere with sex that’s bringing them so much pleasure by proxy. Stoya : Everything is balanced right now, so many beautiful orgasms are happening, and our writer seems to know what boundaries to stay on the proper side of. Why risk making it weird?"
Every poll shows voters want Trump’s tax returns.,slate.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-tax-returns-voters-polls-show-americans-want-them.html,"President Donald Trump listens during a meeting in the Oval Office on Thursday. Alex Wong/Getty Images President Donald Trump and his apologists have concocted an excuse for his refusal to release his tax returns. They claim that voters, by electing Trump president in 2016, gave him a mandate to keep his returns private. The tax question “ was already litigated during the election ,” acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney declared in a Fox News interview on Sunday. “Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns. They knew that he didn’t. And they elected him anyway.” On Monday, Trump’s deputy press secretary, Hogan Gidley, repeated that Democrats had “ litigated this in 2016 ” and that voters had rejected their arguments. On Wednesday, Trump said the public had cleared him. “I got elected last time with this same issue,” said Trump, “ because, frankly, the people don’t care .” Advertisement Candidates for president should release their taxes regardless of public opinion, because every voter has the right to know whether the country’s most powerful officeholder has financial conflicts of interest. Trump’s vast holdings and his shady business history make that concern all the more apt. But for now, let’s stick to a simpler question: Is it true that voters gave Trump a mandate to hide his tax returns? No, it’s false. Every poll shows that Americans think he should release his returns—and that if he doesn’t, Congress should pry the returns from him. Looking back over the past three years, I found roughly 20 surveys on this subject. In each one, most respondents said Trump should cough up his returns. In 2016, the question was posed in various ways, always with the same result. “Do you think it is necessary for presidential candidates to publicly release their tax returns, or don’t you think that’s necessary?” Necessary , 59 percent to 38 percent. “Do you think it is necessary for Donald Trump to publicly release his tax returns, or don’t you think that is necessary?” Necessary , 59 percent to 37 percent. “Do you think Donald Trump should publicly release his tax returns, or not?” Should , 74 percent to 21 percent. “Do you think Donald Trump should or should not release his tax returns for public review?” Should , 73 percent to 24 percent. Polls taken this year show that little has changed. “Do you think Donald Trump should publicly release his tax returns, or not?” Should , 64 percent to 29 percent. “Do you think Donald Trump should or should not release his tax returns for public review?” Should , 67 percent to 27 percent. “Do you think Donald Trump should or should not release his tax returns to the public?” Should , 56 percent to 27 percent. “Do you think Trump has a responsibility to publicly release his tax returns, or does he not have this responsibility?” Has a responsibility , 64 percent to 32 percent. Advertisement Many people who voted for Trump in 2016 expressly rejected the idea that in doing so they were authorizing him to hide his returns. In an August 2016 Quinnipiac University survey, more than a third of respondents who said they were inclined to vote for Trump also said he should release his returns. In a September 2016 CNN poll, half the people who said they intended to vote for Trump said he should disclose his tax forms. In a May 2016 Washington Post/ABC News poll, Republicans were evenly split on whether Trump should release his returns. In the CNN poll, a slight plurality of Republicans said he should release them. In an August 2016 Quinnipiac survey, 62 percent of Republicans said he should do so. This dissident faction of Trump supporters persists. In a HuffPost/YouGov poll taken a week ago, 28 percent of respondents who voted for Trump said he should release his returns. In a CNN poll taken last month, 37 percent of Republicans and 35 percent of Americans who said they approved of Trump’s job performance also said he should release his taxes. It’s true that during the 2016 campaign, Trump and the Democrats litigated, in a political sense, whether he should produce his tax forms. Voters elected Trump, but they rejected his arguments on that issue. One argument, for instance, was privacy. In June 2016, a CNBC poll asked voters whether Trump “ should release his tax returns because the public has a right to know about his financial affairs,” or whether he “should not release his tax returns because his income and financial affairs are no one’s business but his own.” Thirty-one percent of voters agreed with Trump that it was nobody else’s business. But twice as many, 62 percent, said the public had a right to know . Trump also pleaded that he couldn’t release his returns because they were under audit. In the September 2016 CNN survey, only 33 percent of voters bought that excuse. Most said he was “ trying to hide something .” If Trump thinks Democrats will lose a political fight over his tax forms, he’s mistaken. In January, a Post/ABC poll asked the public whether “Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives should or should not use their congressional authority to obtain and release Trump’s tax returns.” Respondents said the Democrats should do so, 60 percent to 35 percent . In March, a Quinnipiac poll asked, “If President Trump refuses to release his tax returns, do you think that Congress should investigate the situation, or not?” Again, respondents said yes, 57 percent to 38 percent . And in a Politico/Morning Consult poll taken a week ago, 51 percent of Americans endorsed “Democrats’ efforts to obtain President Trump’s tax returns.” Only 36 percent opposed such efforts. Advertisement Trump thinks he can dismiss the congressional push for his tax returns as a partisan ploy. But the public sees a difference between matters such as Russian collusion, which have been investigated, and Trump’s taxes, which haven’t. In the January Post/ABC poll, only 38 percent of respondents said Democrats in the House should investigate whether Trump colluded with Russia, and only 40 percent said House Democrats should start impeachment proceedings. But 60 percent said the Democrats should obtain and release Trump’s tax returns. The White House is correct: Trump’s concealment of his taxes was litigated during the election. But the result of that litigation wasn’t that voters bought Trump’s arguments. The result was that they gave him the job for other reasons, while rejecting his arguments on that issue. They wanted to see his taxes, and they still do. And if he doesn’t hand over his returns, they want Democrats to go get them. "

White House wanted ICE to arrest undocumented immigrants and release them in sanctuary cities.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/white-house-trump-stephen-miller-ice-bus-undocumented-immigrant-sanctuary-cities.html,"For the Anti-Abortion Far Right, Six-Week Bans Are Just the Beginning Here’s a Trump White House immigration gambit that likely will shock, but not surprise you.

The aim? Retaliation, of course, against political enemies and for not treating undocumented families like criminals. The Trump folks tried to make this plan a reality on multiple occasions over the last six months, according to Department of Homeland Security officials and email messages reviewed by The Post.
White House officials first broached the plan in a Nov. 16 email, asking officials at several agencies whether members of the caravan could be arrested at the border and then bused “to small- and mid-sized sanctuary cities,” places where local authorities have refused to hand over illegal immigrants for deportation… The attempt at political retribution raised alarm within ICE, with a top official responding that it was rife with budgetary and liability concerns, and noting that “there are PR risks as well.”
Senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller discussed the proposal with ICE, according to two DHS officials. Matthew Albence, who is ICE’s acting deputy director, immediately questioned the proposal in November and later circulated the idea within his agency when it resurfaced in February, seeking the legal review that ultimately doomed the proposal. “This was just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion,” the White House statement said. It was just a brainstorm!"

Surveys show that more and more couples, particularly younger ones, say the ideal relationship would be egalitarian. Research shows that egalitarian couples who fairly share work and home responsibilities are happier and healthier, and they have better sex. But are egalitarian partnerships possible, especially when U.S. work culture demands all-out devotion and women still carry the load as primary caregivers and household managers? We talk to an expert who studies egalitarian couples, from an Ethiopian immigrant nurse and Uber driver who shared caregiving because he had to, to the “trailing spouse” with big dreams in a military family, to Amy Nelson, founder and CEO of the Riveter, who had to quit her job as a corporate lawyer and enlist the help of family and friends, all in an effort to reach that egalitarian ideal.

"Uber plans global domination, but depends on just five cities for a quarter of its bookings",slate.com,Henry Grabar,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/uber-ipo-nyc-london-risks.html,"It’s More Obvious Than Ever What Republicans Want With Ilhan Omar If you’re thinking of investing in Uber when the company goes public this year, you might want to read the document the company published on Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining the potential of its business—and its risks. Some highlights: • Uber has grown very, very fast. The company notched 5 billion trips between its 2011 launch and September 2017—and another 5 billion in the subsequent 12 months. • The total value of Uber’s gross bookings, which counts all the money taken in by all of Uber’s services, a measure of the company’s scale, was $41.5 billion in 2018. More than 80 percent of that is from ridesharing, with most of the rest coming from Uber Eats. • 91 million people used Uber once a month at the end of 2018. • Uber’s business model isn’t all there: While there’s optimism about elements of the core business , the company lost more than $3 billion on operations in 2018, revenue growth slowed between Q3 and Q4, and there’s a possibility that the company might continue to offer big incentive payments to drivers for quite some time and never reach profitability. But one detail in particular caught my eye. About 24 percent of Uber’s bookings—all the money that customers pay through the app and in cash, including driver earnings—occur in just five cities: New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, and São Paulo. For a company that operates in more than 700 cities, including quite a few giants—Mexico City, Tokyo, Paris, Lagos, Hong Kong, Seoul, and Mumbai, to name a few—that concentration gives Uber a surprising vulnerability at the local level. And they know it. The filing reads:
We experience greater competition in large metropolitan areas than we do in other markets in which we operate, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas…An economic downturn, increased competition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater degree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. This vulnerability casts a new light on, for example, Uber’s 2015 humiliation of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio , when the company fought off the City Council’s proposed vehicle cap. That was a warning to other politicians, and a show of power, but it was also a vital business move. The company’s filing also mentions, as a cautionary tale, what happened afterward : Just three years later, the City Council approved minimum rates for drivers and a cap on the number of new ride-hail vehicles. The company also mentions its regulatory challenges in London and San Francisco. During Uber’s previous skirmishes with cities, I always thought the company’s huge reach and light footprint (very few local employees or inventory) gave them a lot of leverage. They could afford to play hardball with Austin, Texas, one week and San Antonio the next, with little impact on a business distributed so widely. The filing reveals that certain cities actually have a pretty strong negotiating position. So do the company’s drivers in those places. And its rivals. What appears to be a global, decentralized platform is in fact highly dependent on the whims of a few local politicians, drivers’ groups, and taxi cab unions that can engineer big chokepoints for the company—as London Mayor Sadiq Khan must have done when he revoked the company’s license in 2017. (They got it back last year.) Another example of the company’s vulnerability by concentration: 15 percent of the bookings pot comes from trips that begin or end at an airport. That might not be so surprising, since airports tend to be cab trips even for car commuters, and being a long way from town, produce high fares. But airports offer a preview of the changing municipal economics that could be coming for Uber. The airport in Charlotte, North Carolina, for example, made more money in 2017 from parking fees than it did from American Airlines. Parking accounted for more than a quarter of the airport’s revenue. As passengers shift to ride-hailing, airport revenues are declining . Airports are an easy place where public authorities can implement a fee on Uber rides to make up for the lost revenue. That same dynamic is set to play out in cities as well. Congestion pricing, which will soon exist in two of Uber’s biggest markets (New York and London), is just the first way that governments are exerting more fine-grained control over how cities raise money from automobile use. Uber actually fought for congestion pricing in New York, believing that the one-time fee on private cars entering Manhattan would work in its favor. It probably will. But that’s not the only way street pricing enabled by new technology could work: Cities can tax vehicles per mile traveled, or per hour in the congestion zone, or just slap a huge tax on Uber vehicles because they produce a lot of traffic and serve a relatively wealthy clientele. One thing the filing makes clear: It wouldn’t take a global movement to stress the company’s business model. A couple big-city mayors could do that all on their own."
The Southern Baptist Convention’s statement of principles on artificial intelligence.,slate.com,Ruth Graham,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/southern-baptist-convention-artificial-intelligence-evangelical-statement-principles.html,"Stem Cell Therapy Is Being Marketed to Autistic Kids. It Shouldn’t Be. Contemporary Christianity does not have a reputation as a vanguard of technological sophistication, or even enthusiasm. Sure, many churches have embraced smartphones’ abilities to spread their messages , for example. But Christian institutions are not often leading the big conversations about technology and culture. Traditional theist religions have “turned from a creative into a reactive force,” as historian Yuval Noah Harari put it in his 2016 book, Homo Deus . “They now mostly agonize over the technologies, methods and ideas propagated by other movements.” That reputation makes a statement on artificial intelligence released Thursday by the Southern Baptist Convention all the more intriguing. The SBC’s public-policy arm, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, spent nine months researching and writing “ Artificial Intelligence: An Evangelical Statement of Principles ,” and it has been signed by 68 prominent evangelical thinkers. The brief document is intended to respond to the “existential questions” raised by A.I. technology. It takes a strikingly optimistic tone in doing so. “This was created not out of fear, but out of an understanding that [A.I.] is a tool that God has given us,” said Jason Thacker, who headed the project at the ERLC. “Our hope is that for the first time in a really long time, the church can be proactively engaging in issues affecting society, rather than always responding and reacting.” The document opens on a note of hope, describing technology in general as a tool that can aid in the Christian mandate “to engage the world around us with the unchanging gospel message of hope and reconciliation.” In most areas, the document acknowledges both the promise and pitfalls of A.I. A section on bias, for example, states that A.I. is “inherently subject to bias and that these biases must be accounted for, minimized, or removed through continual human oversight and discretion.” Other articles—there are 12 total—address A.I. in arenas including medicine and war. (“Any lethal action conducted or substantially enabled by AI must employ human oversight or review.”) Each article ends with a list of Bible verses backing up its claims. (The first verse listed after the section on privacy is Exodus 20:15: “Thou shalt not steal.”) The document avoids referencing specific technologies because the drafting committee intends it to have a long shelf life as a guide and conversation starter within Christian institutions and beyond. “This is a statement of principles,” Thacker said, “not a statement of applications.” “This is a statement of principles, not a statement of applications.” — Jason Thacker The document does draw some firm lines. Article 1 declares that technology ought not to “be assigned a level of human identity, worth, dignity, or moral agency”—robots are not, and will never be, human. And unsurprisingly, Article 6 states that A.I. should not be used to pursue sexual pleasure and “should not intrude upon or substitute for the biblical expression of sexuality between a husband and wife”: It’s Adam and Eve, not Adam and HAL. Albert Antosca, a visiting scholar at Dartmouth College who has written about religion and technology for Slate , said the document would likely have to be adapted as technology advances. But overall, he said, “they’re making a lot of urgent and sophisticated points here. This doesn’t seem like a reactionary document.” The document’s signatories are a who’s who of mainstream conservative evangelicalism. They include the president of Focus on the Family, Jim Daly; the editor in chief of Christianity Today, Mark Galli; the president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, Gabriel Salguero; theologians Richard Mouw and Wayne Grudem; and many current and former Southern Baptist leaders and pastors. One signatory is a senior manager of technical program management at Amazon, but few others have obvious technological backgrounds; Thacker said that some signers have backgrounds or affiliations in the tech world, but opted to list other credentials. (Another notable imbalance: Just a handful of women signed.) American evangelicals are not the only faith group pondering the intersection of A.I. and religion. The Southern Baptist document appears just a few months after Pope Francis met with the president of Microsoft to discuss the ethical use of A.I., a topic he has raised publicly several times . The Vatican and Microsoft are co-sponsoring a prize for the best doctoral dissertation this year on the topic “artificial intelligence at the service of human life.” Antosca pointed out that the Baptist document has a deeply humanist perspective, emphasizing the distinctness of human life and the definitiveness of death. Elements of that perspective may put it somewhat at odds with organizations like the Christian Transhumanist Association , which ponders the possibility of “transcending” traditional humanity by extending life indefinitely, for example. Russell Moore, the head of the ERLC, has been critical of transhumanism , because of the theological belief that humans can only be fully “perfected” by faith in Jesus. He told a reporter in response to the first-ever Christian Transhumanism Conference in 2018 that “there could no more be a Christian transhumanist society than a carnivorous vegan society. The two are completely contradictory.” But Moore also said Christians shouldn’t be afraid of technology and that they should take such challenges seriously long before they’re a reality. That’s exactly what the new document aims to do."
Georgetown Students Vote to Add Fee for Slavery Reparations to Tuition,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/georgetown-students-reparations-fund-vote.html,"For the Anti-Abortion Far Right, Six-Week Bans Are Just the Beginning Undergraduate students at Georgetown University voted overwhelmingly Thursday in favor of paying an additional fee to go toward reparations for the descendants of slaves sold by Georgetown in the 19 th century, in what would, if approved by the university, be the first time an American university financially addresses its past as a slave-owning institution. The “Reconciliation Contribution” would charge students $27.20 per semester to go toward a fund, directed by a board of students and slave descendants, that would support projects in communities where some descendants of Georgetown’s slaves now live. But a student vote is not a binding measure that sets policy for the larger university, and the administration has not committed to the fund. Instead, the university has said it sees the vote as “valuable insight into student perspectives,” according to NBC News . According to the Georgetown University Student Association Elections Commission, which announced the results on Friday, of the nearly 60 percent of undergraduates who voted, 2,541 supported the measure and 1,304 opposed it. In 1838, two Jesuit priests serving as the university’s presidents sold 272 people enslaved by the Maryland Jesuits. The university was mired in debt at the time, and the profits from the sale—$115,000, or about $3 million today, according to the Washington Post —allowed the university to stay open. Proponents of the measure argued that the sale split apart families and sent some slaves South to horrific conditions on cotton and sugar plantations and that the university’s debt to those enslaved people, and their descendants, should be addressed. In 2016, Georgetown publicly recognized and apologized for its slave-holding past, and the university has since renamed the two buildings named after the Jesuit priests who organized the sale. It also gives preferential admissions (considering them as legacy admissions) to descendants of those 272 slaves. Four students are currently enrolled under that admissions policy, according to the Post. Several Democratic presidential candidates have expressed support for some form of reparations nationally—or at least studying the possibility of reparations—including Elizabeth Warren , Kamala Harris, Julián Castro, Beto O’Rourke, and Pete Buttigieg."
How to scan your Airbnb for hidden cameras.,slate.com,Aaron Mak,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/how-to-scan-airbnb-hidden-camera-apps.html,"Stem Cell Therapy Is Being Marketed to Autistic Kids. It Shouldn’t Be. Over the weekend, news outlets reported that a New Zealand man named Andrew Barker had found a camera, hidden in a smoke detector, in his Airbnb that was livestreaming a feed of the living room. Barker was in Cork, Ireland, on a 14-month trip around Europe with his family when they checked into the rental house. Once they unpacked, Barker, who works in IT security, conducted a scan of the Wi-Fi network and found a camera the owner had not mentioned. He was then able to connect to the camera and view the live feed. The next day, the Barkers notified Airbnb, but he told the media that the company treated the incident like a canceled booking and just temporarily suspended the rooming post after a privacy investigation that the family found unsatisfactory. It wasn’t until Nealie Barker, Andrew’s wife, posted details of the incident on Facebook that Airbnb removed the listing and admitted that the original response “did not meet the high standards we set for ourselves.” This isn’t the first time that an Airbnb guest has discovered hidden recording devices in a rental unit. As Ars Technica reported , a woman found a remote-controlled camera in the living room of an apartment she had been planning to stay in for a month in 2013. She sued both Airbnb and the apartment’s residents, alleging that the camera had filmed her without clothing and recorded intimate conversations she had with her partner. In 2017, Florida police arrested a man for video voyeurism after his Airbnb guests reported finding a camera in the bedroom’s smoke detector. Airbnb’s terms of service dictate that hosts must disclose the presence of cameras to their guests. It’s unclear how common a practice it is for Airbnb hosts to hide cameras in their units, but if you’re particularly worried about prying eyes, there are imperfect ways to search for invasive devices. “Hidden cameras are probably rare but there are steps that an average user can take to increase their chances of finding one if one exists,” Barker wrote in an email to Slate. “Since our incident I will be performing network and ports scans at every accommodation we stay at.” That seems like a good practice. But it also requires some knowledge. When the story hit the internet, lots of people found themselves wondering how, exactly, to scan a network. The good news is that doing network and port scans for suspicious devices on the local Wi-Fi network doesn’t require as much technical knowledge as you might fear. Nor does it require expensive gear. Various apps that can perform the scans for you; Barker recommends Angry IP Scanner , NetworkMapper , and Network Scanner by First Row. In his Ireland Airbnb, Barker used Network Scanner for the network scan and NetworkMapper for the port scan, but most apps have both features. Check to see whether there are inexplicably two smoke detectors in the same room. Network scans generally allow users to view the IP addresses and manufacturers of devices connected to the Wi-Fi. In Barker’s case, the manufacturer of the hidden recording device was literally listed as “IPCAMERA.” Once you have the list, it’s a good idea to work backward. “You should in theory be able to tick off each device found through the scan to a device you are aware of and can physically see,” Barker wrote. If you see a device that looks suspicious, a port scan can help to identify its purpose. The scan will list the different ports for connecting to the device and the services they provide. The services will be listed as short codes; a Google search will generally reveal what the codes mean. For example, the code RDP indicates that users can remotely control the desktop of the computer. The codes RTMP and RTSP are for video streaming. These sorts of scans will only work if your device and the camera are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. If the camera is on a different network, or if it stores the footage on an internal hard drive, you’ll have a harder time finding it. For more details on how the scans work, check out the guide that Barker wrote for travelers after his Airbnb incident. Good old-fashioned sleuthing can also be helpful for finding cameras. Consumer-grade hidden cameras come embedded in a variety of different commonplace objects. Glance through the website for BrickHouse Security or the Amazon search results for the term “hidden camera” and you’ll find fake alarm clocks, USB chargers, buckets, lamps, stuffed animals, and bottles of Mountain Dew ($429–$519 on the website Covert Law Enforcement, if you’re curious) with discreet pinhole cameras. When you enter a room, you should check around to see if anything looks out of place. “These things tend to stand out like a sore thumb,” says Dan Tentler, founder and CEO of Phobos Group, a cybersecurity firm. For example, he recommends checking to see whether there are inexplicably two smoke detectors in the same room. Holding an object in your hands can also help to determine whether it’s fake. “If there’s a can of Mountain Dew randomly sat on the kitchen counter … and you walk up and pick up the can, you’re going to immediately know that it’s a hidden camera,” says Tentler. Look for reflections when you shine a light on objects, which may reveal the presence of a lens. If and when you find such a device, make sure to alert Airbnb or the hotel. You might also want to inform law enforcement, especially if you’re in a state where two-party consent is required for recording. “If you find a camera, take pictures of it,” says Tentler. “Make noise, post pictures of the thing on the internet, on Twitter.” "

Republicans kill Herman Cain's Fed nomination. What about Stephen Moore's?,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/republicans-kill-herman-cain-fed-nomination-stephen-moores.html,"Democrats Slam Trump After He Attacks Ilhan Omar With Graphic, Misleading 9/11 Video In a refreshingly sane turn of events, Herman Cain is now expected to pull himself from consideration for the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors thanks to opposition from Republican lawmakers, according to ABC News . Donald Trump announced last week that he intended to nominate the former Godfather’s Pizza CEO and failed presidential candidate for a seat at the central bank. But the idea has been received poorly on Capitol Hill, where four different GOP senators—Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Cory Gardner of Colorado, and Kevin Cramer of North Dakota— have now announced that they would not vote to confirm him, effectively dooming Cain’s candidacy before it was ever made official. Cain’s brief and abortive Fed bid seems to have been done in by a number of factors, all of which were readily foreseeable from the moment he emerged as a contender. Romney, who briefly faced off against Cain in 2012, focused on the former restaurant exec’s glaring lack of qualifications for the job and close political relationship to Trump (he campaigned for the president in 2016 and runs a political action committee dedicated to re-electing him). “I don’t think Herman Cain will be on the board of the Federal Reserve,” the freshman senator said earlier this week. “It’s important that the board be comprised of people who are academics, economists, and not people who are highly partisan.” (On Thursday, Romney was even more dismissive, joking with reporters that “if Herman Cain were on the Fed, you’d know the interest rate would soon be 9-9-9 .”) Cramer said that he was comfortable with Cain’s resume, but the sexual harassment allegations that capsized his presidential campaign more than seven years ago were a deal breaker. “His showmanship doesn’t bother me, his business experience I think is great, simplifying the tax code is fine by me, but character still does matter,” Cramer said. These are all perfectly good reasons to vote against Cain, a proto-Trumpian political novelty figure who was in fact utterly ill-suited for the Fed. He had no substantive experience with monetary policy and gave every indication that he would serve as a partisan lackey for the president if placed on the board. Cain spent most of his life as a vocal inflation hawk and gold bug, but after word of his potential candidacy emerged, he told reporters he would push the central bank to worry less about inflation, echoing Trump’s own line. But this leaves open an obvious question: If Republicans are willing to oppose Cain on both policy and character grounds, why not Trump’s other nominee, conservative economics commentator Stephen Moore? After all, Moore is toting almost all of the same baggage. He does not have an economics Ph.D. and has admitted that he is “not an expert” on monetary policy. Similar to Cain, he has swung from worrying about hyperinflation and endorsing the gold standard during the Obama years to criticizing the Fed for raising interest rates too quickly and raving about imaginary deflation once Trump entered office, a switch that can only be reasonably explained by his partisan leanings and transparent desire for hard-money policies that will slow the economy when Democrats are in power and soft-money policies that will juice it when Republicans run Washington. He is also, fundamentally, an operative: He ran the conservative Club for Growth in the early 2000s, which was dedicated to electing politicians who would cut taxes and regulations. He also advised Trump on economics, wrote a book hailing his policies, and has earned a paycheck lately by defending Trump as a TV talking head. He has his own tabloid-worthy character issues too: Moore owes more than $75,000 in back taxes and was held in contempt of court after failing to pay more than $300,000 in alimony and child support to his ex-wife. According to court records, the man also talked about having a mistress in front of his own children. Sure, Moore hasn’t been accused of groping women . But if qualifications and character both count at all these days, his nomination should sink too."
Game of Thrones’ end could kill the dream of global community.,slate.com,Kyle Mcauley,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-final-season-communal-viewing.html,"Tiger Woods Might’ve Just Pulled Off His Greatest Win Yet In 2008, David Benioff was promoting his latest novel when New York magazine’s Boris Kachka asked him what he was working on next. Benioff replied , “I’m doing a series at HBO. A crappy way of describing it would be The Sopranos in Middle Earth. I was a huge fantasy geek growing up. I was the Dungeon Master in my D&D game. Actually, most writers I know were the Dungeon Masters.”Benioff would later say that he regretted describing Game of Thrones in relation to the network’s just-ended megahit. Still, the self-described fantasy geek got his wish. He and his collaborator D.B. Weiss have become the biggest Dungeon Masters on Earth. Game of Thrones begins its swan song on Sunday. But you probably knew that, and even if you didn’t, the laments of the series’ many fans have been difficult to ignore . When HBO split the final season in two, viewers complained that the network was dragging things out. Now that the end is a month away, innumerable speculations about how the show will end serve as group therapy for fans grieving the inevitable. The television-watching public does not want Game of Thrones to end—because what would take its place? What fictional world could viewers lose themselves in, knowing others across the (real) world were losing themselves along with them? No matter who winds up victorious in Game of Thrones ’ finale, viewers will lose something precious: that sense that, whether at a bar’s watch party or on projectors in backyards or on the couch with family or alone in front of a touch screen, millions of others are doing the same thing at the same time, connecting viewers with those unseen others as much as to the characters on screen. Thrones ’ meteoric rise has been thoroughly documented . But beyond the ratings, the show has become omnipresent, vaulting past such piddling considerations as whether it’s still any good (eh) and into the fabric of our lives. (The latest “cross-licensed” giveaways from Major League Baseball include a bobblehead that dresses up taciturn pitcher Madison Bumgarner as the melodramatic Jon Snow.) Oversaturation has not dimmed interest: Episodes of the latest season have been pirated more than 1 billion times, notwithstanding the increasingly poor reviews . In personal essays and Quora threads , die-hard fans of George R.R. Martin’s source novels and Day 1 viewers continue to lament the show’s attempts to appeal to a broader viewership—which really is the purest proof that Thrones has become, if not democratic (it’s a show about a ruling class on premium cable, after all), then at least communalistic. No matter who winds up victorious in Game of Thrones ’ finale, viewers will lose something precious. Although Game of Thrones ’ reach has been broadened by the influence of social media, the idea of cultural consumers imagining themselves as an interconnected group is an old one. Social scientist Benedict Anderson argued in 1983 that the daily newspaper and the novel were the cultural technologies that allowed early 19 th -century citizens to group themselves into what he calls “imagined communities,” a feeling that led to the rise of what we now think of as nationalism. The newspaper connected a nation to the wider world, and the novel provided a nation with fictional ones. Game of Thrones ’ great promise was to somehow do both. On the eve of the show’s third-season premiere, Grantland’s Andy Greenwald wrote , “What we thought was an exercise in transforming a book into television may actually have helped turn television into a book.” Where 19 th -century printers had cheap pulp paper, 21 st -century TV networks have the internet. Fan sites and social media have kept Thrones in people’s lives well outside the show’s run. “We’re able to see how far-reaching Game of Thrones is throughout the world, that everyone’s watching the same thing together,” Vanity Fair critic Joanna Robinson told the Ringer’s Alyssa Bereznak . Of course, this isn’t literally everyone in the world— 2017 estimates put HBO’s subscriber base at 142 million, of which about a third is in the U.S. But the weekly flood of Twitter jokes and Instagram memes and Tumblr posts lets viewers think of themselves as part of a massive group, an experience that feels more precious as it becomes rarer. Underneath the laments about the show’s conclusion runs a deep anxiety about that feeling’s potentially permanent disappearance . Hardcore fans hate when their art goes mainstream because it makes them anonymous, and that is exactly what Game of Thrones ’ ascendance has done to its viewership. Like a nation’s imagined community, the show’s global public has found an increasingly intense shared identity—we’ll finish this thing even if they kill every last character we love—even as its numbers have ballooned. Sunday’s millions will watch the premiere as much to divine how the show will end as to discover how the creators will break our hearts with every plot twist and every death. With the shared agony of this masochistic catharsis comes a vast feeling of camaraderie. The sheer vastness of Thrones ’ fan base makes each individual fan more anonymous. Forget trying to stand out with a perfect fan theory or the hottest take. The show has seen every take known to the living and the dead. But anonymity in the face of Thrones ’ ubiquity isn’t a bad thing. In fact, after a disappointing seventh season and nearly two years of waiting, I’m convinced it’s the best remaining thing about the show. It might not measure up to other, more idiosyncratic favorites—I hold an unshakable belief that The Americans is the best series of the 2010s—but it’s a kind of relief to settle into a show that doesn’t feel like it’s targeting you, or that at least hides it well. (Remember that Netflix surveils its users as intensely as any tech giant , and that House of Cards was basically commissioned by an algorithm .) Though the pilot’s near-total reshoots famously left the showrunners wondering if the Starks and the Lannisters would ever make it to air, it seems obvious now that grown-up Lord of the Rings would appeal well outside “the demo.” Set against the proliferation of shows and services aimed at increasingly niche audiences, the insane extravagances of Game of Thrones feel like an embarrassing, rare, and affordable luxury. In our algorithmic age, there’s comfort in the crowd."
Supreme Court to Hear a Case That Could Put Countless Immigrants at Risk of State Arrest,slate.com,Samuel Garcia,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/kansas-v-garcia-supreme-court-undocumented-immigrant-id-theft.html,"The Assange Indictment Is a Shot Across the Bow of Press Freedom By the time many of us have just woken up, Manny, an undocumented immigrant I interviewed in South Texas, has already started his workday. (His name has been changed at his and his wife’s request.) Manny is a painter, and he has to start his work early in the morning to avoid the stifling South Texas heat. Manny has been in the United States for more than a decade, and he has been consistently employed since he arrived. During his time in the United States, he has never been arrested, he has started a family, and he has built a full life. Manny works five days a week at a job that an overwhelming majority of Americans would never even consider. Although he is otherwise law-abiding, he could not avoid breaking the law in order to get his job. When he got that job, he did not have the money to hire an immigration lawyer to help him get a work visa or citizenship. With no knowledge of the U.S. immigration system and no money to pay an attorney, it seemed like Manny only had two realistic options for employment: 1) continue working odd jobs that paid cash, or 2) use another person’s Social Security number to procure employment. But Manny had grown sick of under-the-table cash jobs because it was not uncommon for people to refuse to pay him after his work was complete. With a family to feed, he could no longer rely on odd jobs to make ends meet. So he did what a lot of other undocumented people in his position do: He used someone else’s Social Security number to fill in his I-9 form (a form that deals with employment eligibility verification ). Often the Social Security number used by an undocumented immigrant is one of a family member or close friend. Manny’s story is a common one, and the Supreme Court recently announced it would hear a landmark case centered on situations like his. Next term, the court will hear whether states can use information found in an I-9 to criminally prosecute those in Manny’s position, despite a federal statute that suggests they do not have that authority. The court’s ruling will have an enormous impact on the countless undocumented people in this country who use another person’s Social Security number to procure employment. It’s important to understand that undocumented immigrants in the United States have many ways of getting another person’s Social Security number, and most of those ways actually involve the consent of the person they are taking it from. Often the Social Security number used by an undocumented immigrant is one of a family member or close friend. Even if a person consents to another person using his Social Security number when filling out employment forms, using that Social Security number falsely can be illegal under federal law. Some individual states, however, have also made it a crime to use false Social Security numbers on those forms under their identity theft laws . The looming Supreme Court fight centers on such a state case. In Kansas, Ramiro Garcia, an undocumented immigrant who was working as a line cook, was arrested and convicted by state officials for identity theft after using someone else’s Social Security number to fill out his I-9 form. After appealing all the way up to the Supreme Court of Kansas, Garcia’s conviction was reversed based on the federal statute that seems to govern the form’s uses. The court ruled that the state’s identity theft prosecution “was expressly preempted” by federal law. The court explained that the language in 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(5) , the code that makes it a criminal and civil offense to hire undocumented immigrants, “explicitly prohibited state law enforcement use not only of the I–9 itself but also of the ‘ information contained in’ the I–9 for purposes other than those enumerated” in the statute. The enumerated purposes in that statute were limited to federal criminal prosecutions such as perjury, fraud in connection with identification documents, and visa forgery. State criminal prosecutions for identity theft are not included in those enumerated purposes. Kansas appealed the state Supreme Court’s decision, and last month the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear that appeal. Kansas v. Garcia is now likely to be one of the blockbuster cases of the court’s next term. The case deals with complex issues of federal preemption of state laws and of statutory interpretation. One bottom line, though, is that if the court decides to reverse the Kansas Supreme Court’s decision, it could put countless undocumented immigrants at risk of being prosecuted by state governments. The National Council of La Raza has reported that the majority of undocumented immigrants “pay income taxes using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) or false Social Security numbers.” If Kansas v. Garcia results in a reversal, then millions of undocumented people could have their I-9 forms and the information contained therein used against them in identity theft cases brought by individual states. People who work some of the most demanding manual labor jobs in this country could regress from earning an honest and consistent salary to working odd jobs for low and inconsistent pay. The industries that would be the hardest hit are some of the most integral for everyday American life. For instance, according to Pew , agriculture, food manufacturing, and construction are all industries in which unauthorized immigrants make up more than 10 percent of the workforce. Some argue that an affirmation of the Kansas Supreme Court’s decision will only encourage undocumented immigrants to continue falsifying information on I-9 forms. Others argue that a reversal of the decision will make finding work prohibitively difficult for hardworking immigrants who need to feed their families. Both sides seem to be right from a public policy perspective, which is a symptom of a bigger issue: The current immigration regime in the United States is broken. That is a problem that can’t be fixed by the courts. Support our journalism

Watch the Star Wars Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker trailer (VIDEO).,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/watch-the-star-wars-episode-ix-the-rise-of-skywalker-trailer-video.html,"Tiger Woods Might’ve Just Pulled Off His Greatest Win Yet The first trailer for Star Wars: Episode IX , the final episode of the current Star Wars trilogy, has arrived with a teasing glimpse into the end of the Skywalker saga. Arriving four years after the franchise returned with The Force Awakens , the ninth installment’s triumphant title has been revealed to be The Rise of Skywalker. The film will complete a nine-episode arc that began in 1977 with George Lucas’ original Star Wars film, A New Hope. According to director J.J. Abrams, The Rise of Skywalker is set around a year after the events of The Last Jedi , which ended with the eradication of nearly all of the Resistance and the death of Luke. Episode 9 will reunite new trilogy heroes Finn (John Boyega), Rey (Daisy Ridley), and Poe (Oscar Isaac), who all appear briefly in the teaser, as the Resistance prepares to rise again. The trailer also reveals an ominous glimpse of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), last seen attempting to strike out at Luke after declaring himself the Supreme Leader. Though, as expected, the trailer fails to reveal much in terms of plot, it does include several memorable moments that will stick with us until its release, including a tearful hug between Rey and Leia. As Luke declares in a voice-over at the end of the trailer: “No one’s ever really gone.” Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

Rereading the first-season reviews of Game of Thrones.,slate.com,Inkoo Kang,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-first-season-reviews-critics.html,"Which Game of Thrones God Is the Best to Worship? Game of Thrones might well be the last TV show that we watch together , but the HBO series, which returns Sunday for its eighth and final season, certainly didn’t begin that way. Though eagerly anticipated by fans of George R. R. Martin’s novels (which the author had not believed to be adaptable for the screen), the first season of Game of Thrones was met with lingering snobbery toward the fantasy genre by some critics and enormous pressure to succeed The Sopranos , The Wire , and Deadwood in HBO’s lineage of network-defining critical darlings. Of course, it became something much bigger: a cultural juggernaut that heralded new norms in TV storytelling, inspired countless copycats, and remained singularly epic in both scope and popularity. Did critics see the colossus coming? It’s worth traveling back to a time when Game of Thrones was just another series premiere and revisiting the show’s original reviews from 2011, partly to see if the show’s initial episodes presaged its greatness (and its many faults), and partly to see what reviewers may have missed about its appeal. The show’s chattiness and its confusing tangle of storylines—both cited by critics as unnecessary hurdles for the audience—have become two of the show’s signature lures. Other reviews clocked the show’s chronic mishandling of race and gender issues, while committing faux pas of their own—such as the infamous head-scratcher of a New York Times pan that implied that fantasy is “boy fiction.” (According to HBO, the show’s enormous viewership is roughly evenly split, 55 percent men and 45 percent women.) Here are seven early critical reactions to Game of Thrones , in all their glory and cringe. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

HBO will let us, and the audience will love that.’ ” What the review got wrong: “The sheer amount of dialogue—when the show could do flashbacks to, say, important battles of the past—will be a breaking point for many.” Ginia Bellafante, New York Times Headline: “ A Fantasy World of Strange Feuding Kingdoms ” Extremely early-2010s-y show Game of Thrones is compared to: The Tudors What the review got right: “The series rejects no opportunity to showcase a beheading or to offer a slashed throat close-up.” What the review got wrong: “The true perversion, though, is the sense you get that all of this [sexual] illicitness has been tossed in as a little something for the ladies, out of a justifiable fear, perhaps, that no woman alive would watch otherwise. While I do not doubt that there are women in the world who read books like Mr. Martin’s, I can honestly say that I have never met a single woman who has stood up in indignation at her book club and refused to read the latest from Lorrie Moore unless everyone agreed to The Hobbit first.

South Korean women continue to face societal stigma for having an abortion.,slate.com,Tamara Evdokimova,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/abortion-south-korea-legalized.html,"Big Flightless Bird With Deadly Claws Kills Owner in Florida South Korea’s Constitutional Court overturned a 65-year-old ban on abortion in a 7–2 vote on Thursday. “Criminalizing a woman who undergoes abortion of her own will,” the ruling read, “limits the right of self-determination of the woman.” The court called on the Korean parliament to revise the law by 2020. The abortion ban was adopted in 1953, following the 1950–53 Korean War. Women who terminated their pregnancy could face up to one year in prison or a fine of 2 million won (about $1,750). Doctors who performed abortions risked up to two years in prison, although the Korean government rarely prosecuted medical professionals under this law. Some exceptions have been introduced over the years, permitting abortion in cases of rape and incest, when the mother’s life is at risk, and when there is a high risk of hereditary disorders. Despite these allowances, however, abortion under exceptional circumstances requires spousal consent and is always illegal after 24 weeks. According to the Center for Reproductive Rights , South Korea’s restrictions are on par with those in Poland, Thailand, and Saudi Arabia. In Poland, for example, abortion is legal only in cases of incest, rape, or fetal impairment, and requires parental consent for minors. Similarly, in Thailand, abortion is permitted in cases of rape, fetal impairment, or if the pregnancy endangers a woman’s health. Saudi Arabia requires a woman to obtain parental and/or spousal consent and allows terminations only to save the mother’s life. Overall, countries in North America and Europe and Central and Eastern Asia have the most liberal abortion laws in the world, with South Korea and Poland as the two notable exceptions. The court ruling comes at a time when South Korea’s fertility rates have hit historic lows. In the early 1970s, when exceptions to the abortion ban were first introduced, the fertility rate averaged at 4.1 children per woman. In fact, the Korean government was so worried about its increasing population that it offered men exemptions from mandatory military service in exchange for free vasectomies. By 2015, the average was just 1.2 children per woman, one of the lowest in the world. As early as 2009, the government became concerned with declining birth rates, launching a public campaign to discourage abortion, with subway ads proclaiming that “With abortion, you are aborting the future.” Perhaps in response to the government’s concern or due to other factors, abortion rates in Korea have been steadily falling . In 2008, the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs counted 241,411 abortions, whereas in 2017, the number dropped to only 49,764. Of course, those numbers do not account for the many abortions that go unreported. Beyond health risks associated with illegal abortions, fear of retribution has been a major issue for Korean women, with cases of husbands and boyfriends using women’s secret abortions to blackmail them. About 10 percent of Korean women who had an abortion reported using illegally obtained medications to induce a miscarriage, rather than seeking a medical operation. There’s some concern about the unsanctioned use of abortion medication, however, as women often have no way of knowing if pills they’ve purchased illegally are properly manufactured and safe to use, thus increasing their risk of health complications. Contrary to the conservative stance of their government, the majority of Korean women were in favor of overturning the abortion ban before Thursday’s court ruling. In 2018, 75 percent of women believed that the law punishing women for receiving abortions should be amended.Forty-nine percent wanted to specifically amend the rules surrounding spousal consent. Women’s rights groups in Korea have been pressuring the government to uplift the abortion ban for a few years now. The Constitutional Court has already considered amending the anti-abortion legislation back in 2012, when it split 4–4, leaving the law intact. In 2017, more than 200,000 South Koreans signed a petition calling for the legalization of abortion. When South Korea’s Ministry of Health and Welfare classified abortion as an unethical medical practice, activists staged protests in Seoul, demanding an end to the anti-abortion law. Finally, a gynecologist charged with conducting 69 abortions between 2013 and 2015 brought her case before the Constitutional Court in hopes of overturning the 2012 ruling—this time, it worked. Abortion remains a hush-hush topic in South Korean society: A baby in South Korea is considered to be 1 year old at birth , implying that life begins at conception, and unmarried pregnant women continue to face societal stigma. When the Constitutional Court moved to consider the abortion ban, stories of hardships that South Korean women faced after getting an abortion proliferated in the media. One woman told the Japan Times how a doctor openly judged her—24, unmarried—while performing an abortion and dismissed her physical discomfort during the procedure because she’d already “done everything.” Another remembered taking a traditional Korean brew at 21 in hopes of inducing a miscarriage, enduring extreme pain, and being forced to travel to a clinic to receive an illegal abortion when the herbs failed. While this week’s court ruling is a major victory for women and women’s rights activists in South Korea, the country still has a long way to go when it comes to eliminating cultural stigma and normalizing abortion as a valid choice.

Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker is not as exciting because the franchise never ends.,slate.com,Sam Adams,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/star-wars-nine-skywalker-trailer.html,"Tiger Woods Might’ve Just Pulled Off His Greatest Win Yet “No one’s ever really gone.” When Luke spoke those words to Leia in Star Wars: The Last Jedi , tears sprang to my eyes. The character’s warning to his sister about his imminent death doubled as a farewell to actress Carrie Fisher, who died after filming for the movie was complete. But when I heard those same words in the trailer for The Rise of Skywalker , the ninth and (for now) final installment in the generation-spanning series, my eyes rolled instead of misting up. It was a foregone conclusion that Luke, who died—or whatever it is one calls the disintegration of his corporeal form —would return in the last movie, just as Alec Guinness did after Obi-Wan was struck down in the first Star Wars . But the trailer confirms that despite Fisher’s death, Leia, too, will be back, thanks to unused footage from The Force Awakens . (Director J.J. Abrams reassured fans at Friday’s Star Wars Celebration that she will not appear as an uncanny digital doppelgänger as she did in Rogue One ). And though Disney CEO Robert Iger said that the Star Wars movies will enter “a bit of a hiatus” after the release of The Rise of Skywalker , he also announced that that the first episode of spinoff series The Mandalorian will be available on the company’s streaming service, Disney+, when it launches on Nov. 12, with another, yet-untitled series focusing on Rogue One ’s Cassian Andor to follow in 2021.

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. To paraphrase an old Dan Hicks song , how can we miss Star Wars when it won’t go away? Iger talks about the “hiatus” like it’s a silent moment of respect, but it’s more like a pit stop, a brief pause to kick the tires before getting back on the track and speeding around in circles. If you love Star Wars , as I sometimes do , this ought to be good news. You get a Star Wars , and you get a Star Wars , and you get a Star Wars ! But seeing the first live-action Star Wars TV show listed alongside the likes of High School Musical: The Music: The Series —a title that looks more like an old-school SAT question than a forthcoming Disney+ offering—makes it feels like just another brand extension, about as thrilling as a new variety of Snickers. Part of what made the Star Wars trilogies so exciting was their sheer improbability, but it’s now more difficult to imagine a world in which they stop churning out Star Wars content than one in which it goes on forever. I wish Solo had been better, but there’s a strange kind of relief in its relative failure , which proves that it’s possible for a Star Wars movie to be bad, or at least mediocre, enough to scuttle its clearly prepared-for sequel. When the new trilogy was announced, I was thrilled that my daughter would have a Star Wars to call her own. Now I hope that someday she’ll know a world without Star Wars —at least for long enough that the next time it comes back, it’ll be a surprise and not an inevitability. Support our journalism

"The Trump administration just settled a suit that could reunite 2,700 immigrant families.",slate.com,Dahlia Lithwick,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-administration-settled-central-american-minors-parole-program-lawsuit.html,"Fox’s Wallace Only “Comfortable” Playing Five Seconds of Trump’s “Horrible” Omar Video I n a week that opened with the White House “ cleaning house” at the Department of Homeland Security and ended with the president openly threatening to release detained immigrants into so-called sanctuary cities to “punish” his immigration reform foes, some good news has come in a major legal challenge to another secretive and “tough” immigration policy. On Friday afternoon, the government signed a settlement agreement in a massive class-action suit challenging the Trump administration’s termination of the little-known Central American Minors (CAM) parole program . As a result of that agreement, almost 3,000 vulnerable kids will have a chance to be reunited with their families in the United States. The Obama-era CAM program was created in 2014 , following news of a surge of tens of thousands of unaccompanied children fleeing violence in the Northern Triangle countries El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The initiative, intended to create a safe and lawful alternative to dangerous solo treks through Mexico, allowed lawful immigrants who lived in the U.S. to apply for refugee status on behalf of their children younger than 21 and certain eligible relatives. The secretary of homeland security was given case-by-case discretion to parole in foreign nationals for “urgent humanitarian reasons” or “significant public benefit” for those who perhaps didn’t meet the stringent definition of refugee but nevertheless merited consideration on the grounds of humanitarian relief. These eligibility determinations were made when the minors were still in their home countries so as to avoid dangerous solo travel via Mexico. Humanitarian parole would allow them to spend two years in the United States, without a pathway to citizenship. The program stuttered to a stop almost as soon as Donald Trump took office . In response, a lawsuit was brought in June on behalf of the families of 12 minors whose lives were in limbo as the program languished. The suit , filed by the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), one of the groups that first challenged the Trump administration’s travel ban, was on behalf of the more than 2,700 children who had already applied before the program was terminated but had received no answer. Many of these applicants had already gone through months or years of processing and had already been approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for relocation pending final medical and security checks. But the program was shuttered, first in secret, without any notice to the applicants, and then formally in August of 2017 with an unexplained mass rescission of conditional approval for parole status for nearly 3,000 children. Worse still, the plaintiffs alleged that USCIS had continued to accept money from applicant families—including $400 for DNA tests, $100 or more for medical exams, and $1,400 for each child’s plane ticket—long after the program had been decommissioned. In effect, they argued, the program was still taking applications on its website and accepting payments while rescinding everyone’s conditional approval en masse. This willingness to sign off on a settlement agreement suggests yet again that this border crisis is less about public safety than ugly political signaling. In December, a federal magistrate judge found that the cancellation of the program was illegal under the Administrative Procedure Act, which delineates how federal agencies propose and establish new regulations. Then, early last month, the same federal magistrate judge in San Francisco ordered the administration to restart the processing of CAM applications for those who had already been conditionally approved, finding that the government’s action was causing irreparable harm to the plaintiffs by preventing their children from escaping life-threatening danger. She gave the government until March 21 to begin processing these children at late stages of processing again and explicitly ordered that “DHS may not adopt any policy, procedure, or practice of not processing the beneficiaries or placing their processing on hold en masse” and “must process the beneficiaries in good faith.” On Friday afternoon, the Department of Homeland Security entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, in which USCIS now agrees to process the approximately 2,700 people who had been conditionally approved for parole prior to the CAM parole program’s termination and agrees to process them under the pre-termination standards. That means that, for the families who have been waiting for years to be reunified in the U.S. with children facing horrific danger and violence in Central America, at least the process of attempting to reunify now begins again. For S.A., the plaintiff whose name is on the IRAP lawsuit, that will finally mean the possibility of reunification with her daughter and small grandson. S.A. has lived lawfully in the U.S. since 2001 under a program designed to help citizens of countries experiencing armed conflict. She works for a lice-removal company in San Francisco. Her youngest daughter, who still lives in San Salvador, has been threatened with brutal gang violence. She and her baby son had been cleared in February of 2017 to travel to the United States and had paid nearly $5,000 for their flights, DNA tests, and other processing requirements at that time. Their approval was rescinded when the CAM program was canceled. Similarly situated teens in the lawsuit, fleeing from horrific gang violence and sexual abuse, will now at minimum see their applications processed as promised. For Linda Evarts, the attorney with IRAP who litigated this suit, the agreement with the Trump administration is an unalloyed win for reunification of families: “We are so pleased that after many years apart our clients will finally have the opportunity to reunite with each other in safety. These families belong together here in the United States, and we are hopeful this settlement will allow for their swift reunification.” Given the Trump administration’s current stance that holds that all migrants, but especially those from Central America, are de facto criminals and rapists and gang members, this willingness to sign off on a settlement agreement suggests yet again that this border crisis is less about public safety than ugly political signaling .

Candida auris: How do hospitals stop the spread of drug-resistant superbugs.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/candida-auris-hospitals-superbug-spread-prevention.html,"It’s Time for the Heroic Male Paleontologist Trope to Go Extinct On Saturday, the New York Times published a fascinating and anxiety-inducing article about the rise of an antifungal-resistant yeast called Candida auris in hospitals around the world. Patients with weakened immune systems are particularly susceptible, and once the fungus hits, infection spreads through their bloodstreams and causes fever and chills. Nearly half of people sickened by it die within 90 days, according to the Times, though it’s unclear if they are killed by the pathogen itself or by the diseases and conditions that landed them in the hospital in the first place. C. auris can also survive for weeks outside a patient—on sinks and mattresses, door knobs and bedside tables. To eradicate it after one patient died, a hospital in Brooklyn even “had to rip out some of the ceiling and floor tiles” in his room. How often do hospitals have to take such extreme steps to stop the spread of these drug-resistant superbugs? Fortunately, very rarely, but when they do, the steps required can be expensive and exacting. According to the CDC, hospitals can often manage outbreaks by simply paying more attention to cleaning the environment and equipment around a patient. Medical experts know how to kill pretty much everything we encounter with disinfectants. The hospital’s standard quaternary ammonium compound —a common antimicrobial cleaner that kills many bacteria, fungi, amoebas, and viruses—is used for everyday cleaning and works most of the time. For the viruses (such as noroviruses) and bacteria (such as the very-long-living Clostridioides difficile ) that survive, the hospital can use a bleach-based cleaner or other disinfectant known to kill specific organisms . The concern in infectious outbreaks is generally that we will encounter a strain of a familiar bacteria or fungus that has developed a drug resistance that makes it hard to kill once it’s settled in a patient’s body. Hospitals are, unfortunately, one place a patient is more likely to encounter an antibiotic-resistant strain of something. They are, after all, where a large amount of antibiotics are used. That becomes particularly troublesome when paired with the long life span and sturdiness displayed by hardier microbes such as C. auris and C. difficile. While most pathogens die when left without a host, these can survive for weeks or months. When hospitals know they have encountered an infection that can jump easily from patient to patient, they take crisis-level precautions. They isolate patients and prevent staff who treat them from caring for others. They hold meetings for medical and cleaning staff to train them on the specific rules for the specific microbe. They require visitors and staff to don gloves, gowns, and masks while in the patients’ rooms and become extra vigilant about ensuring no one leaves without washing their hands. (Thorough and careful hand-washing can go a long way to keeping pathogens from running amok.) Depending on the type of contaminant, they may also place patients in a ventilated room that doesn’t allow air to circulate into the rest of the hospital. In extreme circumstances, like this C. auris outbreak, hospitals may be forced to tear apart rooms to get to where the microorganisms may be living. Typically, hospitals are only forced to discard more easily movable objects: infected mattresses or linens (as in a particularly tragic outbreak of Mycobacterium abscessus in a New Orleans pediatric hospital) or tools and other smaller sources of infection. In one case in the 1970s, a green liquid soap used to clean skin for IV insertions had been contaminated with the bacteria Pseudomonas stutzeri . In a much more recent case, the Food and Drug Administration traced two types of fungi, including Aspergillus , the most common cause of fatal fungal infections, to drug vials given to six patients in an experimental study. It’s not unheard of for a hospital to have to tackle plumbing more aggressively. Especially in older buildings, bacteria cling to and flourish in sinks and pipes. When three people died in an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease at the University of Wisconsin’s hospital in Madison last year, the hospital found the bacteria in its pipes and, like others in the same situation, simply pumped chlorine into the water. In other cases, the pipes have to be ripped out for testing and sanitizing. Recently, the staff at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, experimented with reducing the amount of bacteria that can grow in a water system by “literally taking out plumbing and putting it in a different shape .” One of the most extreme responses to an outbreak occurred at that same hospital, during a 2011 outbreak of an antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase , or KPC , a bacterium that can, like C. auris , cause infections in blood streams or wounds, leading to fevers, chills, a bloody cough, and eventually organ failure. Patients began testing positive for serious infections at a rate of around one per week, and standard cleaning failed to stop the spread. The hospital staff tore apart the plumbing in some rooms to remove sink drains where they found the bacteria lurking. They also used a robot to spray hydrogen peroxide in those emptied-out rooms after patients were moved to a separate ICU. (According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this technique has not been tested and proven effective and is therefore only recommended as an extra precaution after scrubbing everything else by hand.) These cleaning and isolation methods eventually worked, but of the 18 patients infected by KPC that year, six died from it. The NIH case showed how techniques more advanced than bleach and isolation can come in handy to tackle outbreaks. A team of NIH researchers used genome sequencing to quickly decipher and trace the genetic code of the bacteria from one patient’s infection to another so that they were able to figure out how it had spread. According to a 2013 study from the case, the technology allowed the staff to determine that all the patients had been infected from one another, not independently, and they were able to pinpoint their areas of weakness. Advanced investigative approaches like this genetic sequencing have allowed hospitals to better track and confront the new and aggressive drug-resistant strains alarming the medical community. The anxiety some medical professionals have about C. auris is valid: It is not acting in a way experts may have expected based on other forms of Candida , and that uncertainty translates into a need for caution. As experts have become more familiar with C. auris , they feel more confident about how to eradicate it from an environment and likely won’t need to take such extreme measures as ripping out parts of the ceiling and walls—a simple bleach cleaning would likely do the trick. The real danger is in human fallibility: If someone fails to designate tasks clearly, a piece of medical equipment may fail to get the thorough disinfecting and sanitizing it needs in a crisis. The environmental services staff—the (sometimes underpaid) people in charge of scrubbing a patient’s room—often aren’t allowed to touch the medical equipment, and that discrepancy can allow germs to sneak through. Some medical equipment, such as X-ray machines, cannot be reserved for just one patient, and hospitals may struggle to eliminate bacteria from such bulky and complex machines. Manufacturers of hospital equipment can accidentally introduce contaminants to their products. And doctors and nurses, who often work long shifts, are susceptible to the kinds of careless mistakes we all make. But still, patients shouldn’t worry toomuch about how their hospital is preparing for these new infections.

On this episode, preschool kids get their first taste of democratic participation when they vote on their class name, and private schools try to display the value of democracy by making kids vote on everything , even the school budget. Does it work, or do kids make terrible decisions? One diagnosis of our modern-day political problems is that too many stupid people are voting for stupid things. There are two proposed fixes: mandate that everyone vote, so as to diminish the power of ignorant and irrational voters; or find ways to disenfranchise misinformed people. This week, we examine both proposals, whether compulsory voting is a solution to the problems of democracy and whether getting rid of democracy altogether can be wise or just. We look at Sudbury Valley School and Brooklyn Free School, democratic schools where people who are thought too ignorant and irrational to vote are given democratic power. Do these schools offer any lessons for our democratic problems? Guest voices include Jill Sheppard, Jason Brennan, Noleca Radway, Jonathan Ho, and alumnae of democratic schools. In the Slate Plus segment, we look at how the compulsory voting system in Australia works, examine whether compulsory voting has consistent policy implications, and consider arguments that it is an infringement on liberty.

"Judge Carlton Reeves: Donald Trump is leading an ""assault on our judiciary.""",slate.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/judge-carlton-reeves-donald-trump-assault-judiciary-scotus.html,"Judge Carlton Reeves. U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi/ Wikimedia In his nine years on the bench, Judge Carlton Reeves has proved to be one of the most eloquent, courageous, and principled jurists in the United States. Reeves, appointed by President Barack Obama to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, has issued a series of pathbreaking decisions protecting the rights of women and minorities. He struck down Mississippi’s same-sex marriage ban; invalidated a law banning abortions after 15 weeks, dismissing its ostensible goal of protecting women’s health as “pure gaslighting”; and threw out a racial gerrymander designed to dilute black citizens’ votes. This last decision so infuriated a conservative appeals court judge that she launched a personal attack on Reeves that is now the subject of a judicial ethics complaint . Advertisement Reeves is not one to mince words or conceal his contempt for injustice. And on Thursday, he delivered an extraordinary speech upon receiving the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in Law. Reeves’ speech is worth reading or listening to in full. The address is a powerful defense of diversity and equality, as well as a grave warning that, as Reeves put it: “We are now eyewitnesses to the third great assault on our judiciary”—one led by President Donald Trump. The first assault, Reeves explained, came during Reconstruction when white supremacists reversed the post–Civil War march of civil rights. Ku Klux Klan members and their allies attempted to assassinate black judges, shot black jurors, and “filled judgeships with former Confederates who had sworn to uphold slavery.” The second came after Brown v. Board of Education , when segregations assailed courts’ efforts to integrate the South, “smearing judges, shrinking judicial power, and scrubbing diversity from courtrooms.” Senators tried to strip courts “of jurisdiction over civil rights claims and impeach judges receptive to those claims.” Judges “who sought to deliver justice” faced “death threats and hate mail. Their pets were poisoned. Their children’s graves were desecrated.” Beginning with President Jimmy Carter, however, “our nation witnessed a revolution, one that dramatically expanded and improved the body of expertise federal courts depend on to find truth. We saw the addition of more black judges, more women judges, more Latina and Latino judges, more Asian-American judges, more Native American and Pacific Islander judges, and more openly LGBTQ judges than ever before.” But “this effort to make our judiciary reflect America was as brief as it was remarkable.” Because now the third assault has begun. Reeves continued:
If you’ve never relied on a court, you may not see the assault. If you’ve never seen a friend or loved one wrongly imprisoned, you may not feel it. If you have never been stopped for Driving While Black, like my friend Judge Robert Wilkins, you might not fear it. But if you know the words of Mississippi’s darkest moments, you can hear it. Advertisement Then, in a remarkable passage, Reeves listed Trump’s litany of condemnations against the judiciary:
When politicians attack courts as “dangerous,” “political,” and guilty of “egregious overreach,” you can hear the Klan’s lawyers, assailing officers of the court across the South. … When the powerful accuse courts of “open[ing] up our country to potential terrorists,” you can hear the Southern Manifesto’s authors, smearing the judiciary for simply upholding the rights of black folk. When lawmakers say “we should get rid of judges,” you can hear segregationist senators, writing bills to strip courts of their power. And when the executive branch calls our courts and their work “stupid,” “horrible,” “ridiculous,” “incompetent,” “a laughingstock,” and a “complete and total disgrace,” you can hear the slurs and threats of executives like George Wallace, echoing into the present. Every single one of these quotes was uttered by Trump. Reeves went on: Advertisement
I know what I heard when a federal judge was called “very biased and unfair” because he is “of Mexican heritage.” When that judge’s ethnicity was said to prevent his issuing “fair rulings.” When that judge was called a “hater” simply because he is Latino. I heard the words of James Eastland, a race-baiting politician, empowered by the falsehood of white supremacy, questioning the judicial temperament of a man solely because of the color of his skin. I heard those words and I did not know if it was 1967 or 2017.
This false seed is being sown across this country, from Mississippi to Virginia. I know, because I am there. The proof is in my mailbox. In countless letters of hatred I’ve been called a “piece of garbage,” “an arrogant pompous piece of sh**,” “a disgrace,” an “asshole …[who] will burn in hell,” and the “embodiment of Satan himself.” One person has even told me that he has “prayed that God will give [me] complete discomfort.” The deliverers of hate who send these messages aim to bully and scare judges who look like me from the judiciary. And so they share an aim with those who used whips and ropes and trees against my ancestors: scrubbing the black experience from our nation’s courts. Reeves then tore into the astonishing lack of diversity among Trump’s judicial nominees:
This attack is heard loudest in the slander of Judge Curiel. But it will be felt through this administration’s judicial nominations, especially those confirmed with the advice and consent of the Senate. Of the Article III judges confirmed under the current administration, 90 percent have been white. Just one of those judges is black. Just two are Hispanic. It’s not just about racial diversity. Barely 25 percent of this administration’s confirmed judges are women. None have been black or Latina. Achieving complete gender equality on the federal bench would require us to confirm only 23 women a year. … Think: in a country where they make up just 30 percent of the population, non-Hispanic white men make up nearly 70 percent of this administration’s confirmed judicial appointees. That’s not what America looks like. That’s not even what the legal profession looks like. …
This administration and a bare majority of the Senate, walking arm-and-arm, are not stumbling unaware towards a homogeneous judiciary. Think of the slurs against Judge Curiel. Think of the nominations to the bench of those who call diversity “code for relaxed standards,” who call transgender children part of “Satan’s plan,” who defend the KKK in online message boards, who led voter suppression efforts for segregationists like Jesse Helms. Think of the pattern of judicial nominees refusing to admit, like generations of nominees before them have, that Brown v. Board was correctly decided. The consequences of this “homogeneous judiciary,” Reeves noted, will be devastating to justice. Advertisement
Defending the judiciary means more than demanding that more women and people of color be appointed to the bench. With no Muslims on the bench, will our judiciary understand the many facets of religious freedom? How can it defend economic opportunity with so few judges who know the taste of a free lunch program or the weight of poverty? How can our judiciary understand the depths of mass incarceration when so few judges have stood with the accused or know them as neighbors, as Sunday School students, as loved ones? Filled only with the experiences of prosecutors and state court judges, of Big Law partners and corporate counsel, of a single religion or sexual orientation, our courts will fail to find the many truths justice must see. We need a judiciary as diverse as our country—as diverse as “We the People.” Reeves then turned to the Supreme Court. “We have as many justices who have graduated from Georgetown Prep,” he pointed out, “as we have justices who have lived as a non-white person. When our Supreme Court captures such a narrow set of perspectives, what truths will it overlook?” Moreover, too many justices have failed to defend the judiciary against Trump’s bigotry. “It is not enough for judges,” Reeves said, “seeing race-based attacks on their brethren, to say they are merely ‘disheartened,’ ” as Justice Neil Gorsuch did , “or to simply affirm their nonpartisan status,” as Chief Justice John Roberts has . “We must do more to defend our bench.” But courts “must do more than denounce and diversify.” Judges must demand “resources they need to find truth. We must expand the reach and power of our courts, offering justice to all who claim the promise of America.” Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has lately moved in the opposite direction . And Trump’s new crop of judges shows no interest in “offering justice to all.” Due to the cynicism and cowardice of senators and judges who kowtow to Trump, this “third great assault on the judiciary” shows no sign of ceasing. But Reeves refuses to stand by and watch the erosion of civil rights in quiet dismay. He has issued a call to arms for all who support a strong, independent, and diverse judiciary: fight for what you believe in before Trump and his allies “close the courthouse doors to those who most need justice.” "
William Barr obliterated the DOJ’s standard for defending laws because Donald Trump asked.,slate.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/william-barr-aca-lawsuit-donald-trump-doj.html,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Attorney General William Barr has faced harsh criticism for his problematic treatment of the Mueller report, which some have suggested appeared to be calculated to benefit the president. But a different action Barr recently took at President Donald Trump’s behest should be equally concerning. Last month, the attorney general announced that the United States will cease defending any portion of the Affordable Care Act in the courts. Instead, the DOJ will join a number of state attorneys general in challenging the constitutionality of the entire ACA, following the effective repeal of the individual mandate by Congress. Advertisement This comes after the DOJ stopped defending the constitutionality of the ACA’s protection of insurance coverage for those with preexisting conditions last year . In taking the position that the entire ACA is constitutionally void, Barr abandoned a long-standing principle that the Department of Justice is duty-bound to defend the constitutionality of federal laws. In the words of one of Barr’s predecessors, such an action by the nation’s chief law enforcement officer may jeopardize the equilibrium of our constitutional system. Barr has all but acknowledged that the arguments against the ACA’s constitutionality, although they were accepted by one trial judge, are far from compelling; in fact, most observers ( including some opponents of the law ) consider them to be extremely weak. But during testimony before Congress this week, Barr stated that he nonetheless feels duty-bound to attack the ACA in the courts because Trump, after failing to convince a majority of the Senate to vote in favor of repealing the ACA, is now eager to see the act nullified by the courts instead. Barr’s decision is at direct odds with a policy upheld for decades by attorneys general in Republican and Democratic administrations. As President Ronald Reagan’s first attorney general, William French Smith, wrote in 1981, the DOJ has “ a duty to defend the constitutionality of an Act of Congress whenever a reasonable argument can be made in its support .” While serving as President Jimmy Carter’s attorney general, Benjamin Civiletti explained that this policy is rooted in the Constitution’s separation of powers. While the courts are charged with protecting “ both the government and the citizenry from unconstitutional action, legislative and Executive [ … ] only the Executive Branch can execute the statutes of the United States, ” including by defending them in the courts. Therefore, “if executive officers were to adopt a policy of ignoring or attacking acts of Congress whenever they believed them to be in conflict with the provisions of the constitution, their conduct in office could jeopardize the equilibrium established within our constitutional system.” Advertisement Prior attorneys general recognized only one extremely narrow exception to this obligation to defend the nation’s laws: when an attorney general concludes that there is no reasonable argument in favor of a federal statute’s constitutionality. As Civiletti put it, where “everything in our constitutional jurisprudence inescapably establishes” that a law is unconstitutional, then the Executive Branch can properly decline to defend or enforce it. Until recently, conservative legal scholars emphasized the narrowness of this exception. Many of them assailed Eric Holder, President Barack Obama’s attorney general, for choosing to end the DOJ’s defense of a portion of the Defense of Marriage Act denying federal government recognition to same-sex marriages. While Holder argued that changes in Supreme Court jurisprudence left no reasonable basis to defend the law , his opponents contended that Holder was being disingenuous and placing ideological concerns above his duty to defend a duly enacted federal law. In fact, conservative legal advocate Edward Whelan continued to assail Holder’s decision to abandon the defense of DOMA even after the law was struck down by the Supreme Court, calling it a “ shameful moment in politicized government lawyering and … a dangerous precedent that deserves condemnation .” Barr’s decision to attack the ACA in court, however, sets a far more dangerous precedent. Unlike Holder, Barr does not even make a pretense of arguing that there is no reasonable argument in favor of the ACA’s constitutionality. Rather, during his recent testimony, Barr explained to Republican Sen. Susan Collins that he acceded to the president’s demand to attack the ACA in the courts because the arguments mounted against the law are “ defensible and reasonable .” Barr’s reasoning turns long-standing DOJ policy on its head, allowing the attorney general to abandon a federal law so long as there is some plausible basis to question its constitutionality—even if there are reasonable, or even compelling, arguments to be made in support of the law’s validity. When pressed, Barr asserted that supporters of the ACA have “ nothing to worry about ” if they are right that the arguments the DOJ is adopting against the ACA’s constitutionality are weak. “I think people should take a deep breath,” Barr said. “If this is such a wacky position that the administration is taking, then there’s nothing to fear. Then the law will be upheld.” Just “[l]et the courts do their job,” the attorney general suggested. But Barr’s argument misses the point. As his predecessor Civiletti observed decades ago, while it is the courts’ constitutional “job” to protect against “unconstitutional action,” the Constitution assigns the executive branch the obligation to faithfully defend the nation’s laws, including before the courts. It is, therefore, in Ed Whelan’s words, shameful for the DOJ to abandon that job. Advertisement Barr’s DOJ is already taking full advantage of its newfound freedom to pick and choose which federal laws to defend in court. Just this week the solicitor general informed House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler that the DOJ has chosen to cease defending the constitutionality of a federal law criminalizing the practice of female genital mutilation and cutting (FGM/C) . Earlier this month, the acting director of the DOJ’s Office on Violence Against Women decried the “horrific crime of” FGM/C,” explaining that “ at least 513,000 women and girls in the United States have suffered or are at risk of becoming victims ” of it. The FBI, ICE , and the State Department have all recently likewise reiterated a commitment to using the full force of the federal government against this heinous practice. But the federal law against FGM/C is largely grounded in Congress’ regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause, which conservative legal scholars and judges have long been intent upon limiting on principles of federalism; the other rationale for the statute—that it implements Congress’ power to enforce an international human rights treaty— is similarly objectionable to strong advocates of federalism . Accordingly, as in the case of the ACA, the DOJ is abandoning its defense of a law against this heinous practice for transparently ideological reasons. Advertisement In explaining his decision to mount a litigation effort against the ACA, Barr stated that he serves the president and other “ stakeholders ” in the executive branch. Therefore, if the president directs him to attack a statute, even one Barr seems to believe will ultimately be upheld in the courts, the attorney general considers himself duty-bound to oblige. This goes to the heart of Barr’s misconception of his role as attorney general. He is the lawyer for the United States, not for Donald Trump. As such, he and the DOJ owe a duty to uphold and defend the laws of the nation, even if the president does not like them, just as he is obligated to disclose facts uncovered by Robert Mueller, even if they are harmful to Donald Trump. Barr’s failure to abide by such foundational principles truly threatens the equilibrium of our constitutional system. "
Participation trophies aren’t new. We’ve been handing them out since World War I.,slate.com,Stefan Fatsis,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/participation-trophy-history-world-war-i.html,"Virginia Gives Hope to Humiliated Losers Everywhere Around the same time, universities began awarding a literal “participation trophy” to a fraternity or other group that had the most members participate in intramural sports. In 1924, the University of Minnesota debuted a “ 30-inch sterling participation trophy ” for “the campus organization having the highest number of participation points.” The idea was to encourage students to do sports—participation as something to be rewarded, because it’s good to exercise, to compete, to try hard, win or lose. The participation trophy was a feature of campus life for decades. Military bases handed out participation trophies during and after World War II. Schools and sports leagues picked up the practice, for individuals and teams. In 1942, each member of the winning team in the Western Division Class B of the Montana state boys’ basketball tournament—Corvallis, which beat Townsend, 50–35—got a miniature gold basketball, while “ all other players received participation trophies.” In 1955, the Ithaca, New York, peewee football program may have introduced the emphasis of playing over winning—hastening our cultural decline—when it gave a participation trophy to the team that used “ the greatest number of players per game for the season.” When David Holder and Billy Lothian of Wayne, New Jersey, were ousted from the 1955 state marbles championship, the local paper reported that they “came back with participation trophies.” “Susan and Dave Win Speech Test,” the Marysville, Ohio, Journal-Tribune headlined in 1956; 11 losers got participation trophies. So did the nonwinners in the 1970 Oneonta, New York, soap box derby, and the 17 members of the swine club and 13 members of the sheep club at the 1977 Lehigh County 4-H Beef Banquet (renamed the Livestock Banquet to account for the addition of swine and sheep). The Amsterdam News in New York recorded what might be the record for participation trophy distribution: 1,840 given to the “youngsters” in an anti-poverty recreation program in Brooklyn. The year? 1966. The headline on that story was “A Thousand Kids Earn Trophies.” The verb undoubtedly would have outraged James Harrison and could have served as a harbinger of the culture war to come. The handing out of participation trophies ratcheted up in the 1990s, coinciding with the growth of pay-for-play in youth sports, efforts to increase and broaden participation among children, and a cultural move to reduce the emphasis on winning. The first person to use “participation trophy” as an epithet might have been Janelle Gerth, the catcher on the 1993 Princeton, Minnesota, high school girls’ softball team, who, after back-to-back sixth-place finishes in the state tournament, “told the team that we’ve got enough participation trophies,” her coach told the St. Cloud Times. It was a short walk from there to the take that participation trophies foster entitlement and diminish achievement. John Powers of the Boston Globe complained in 1993 that “we have become a nation of ‘winners,’ our shelves lined with consolation trophies and certificates of participation.” Powers didn’t use the exact phrase, but a year later the Abbeville, Louisiana, Meridional did : “Participation Trophies Take Away Meaning.” A dad columnist in El Paso, Texas, complained in 1998 that participation trophies were responsible for “giving our children a false sense of accomplishment.” The backlash was in full swing by 2005, when the Wall Street Journal published a trend story on how youth sports leagues were abandoning participation trophies . While youth sports organizations continue to dump it , the participation trophy endures. But much more than a hunk of hardware, it’s a topic of study for its effects on children these days; a talking point for players like Bryce Harper and Kobe Bryant and coaches like Jeff Walz of Louisville’s women’s basketball team (and a sledgehammer point for the Alabama football strength coach); and a proxy for a dopey debate about whether a generation of Americans is spoiled, lazy, and needy. “Police Calm Millennial Protesters by Handing Out Participation Trophies,” a satirical website wrote in 2016 . People believed it . Literal participation trophies or medals are indeed dumb. Not because they send a “ dangerous life message ,” as a high school student wrote in the New York Times, or because they constitute “ child abuse ,” as a local news anchor in Washington said. They’re dumb because they inevitably wind up collecting dust. It’s fine to give a memento to children under the age of, say, 9 who complete a season of a sport or participate in some other competition. Just give them something useful, like a hat or a piece of equipment. Even better, give them something personal. Into middle school, every season, I designed a certificate for my daughter’s girls’ soccer team, the Power. One theme was a faux Instagram account written by our team mascot, Power Bar. The girls then created an actual account for Power Bar. Everyone participated in that. As Torie Bosch wrote in Slate last year, kids aren’t idiots . No one thinks they’re a great athlete—or, 20 years later, that they deserve a promotion—because they got a 4-inch-tall plastic cup for playing soccer in kindergarten. In a simpler time, a trophy for participation was just a trophy for participation. The top finishers in the 1955 soap box derby in San Bernardino, California, got a Schwinn bicycle, baseball equipment, fishing and scuba gear, and cameras. But the race organizers, and the local paper, didn’t want anyone to feel slighted. “ Best of all ,” the local paper wrote (emphasis mine), “each heat winner gets a trophy and both losers in each heat also get participation trophies.” The story was illustrated with photos of both trophies. The headline: “ Everybody Wins .”

Trump reportedly offered pardon to Homeland Security chief if he broke law to block migrants.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-offered-pardon-homeland-security-chief.html,"Notre Dame Cathedral Is on Fire President Donald Trump reportedly told Kevin McAleenan, who is currently the acting Homeland Security secretary, he would pardon him if he were sent to jail for blocking people from entering the United States along the southern border. Several outlets reported that Trump had that conversation with McAleenan last week when they were in Calexico, California. At the time, McAleenan was the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. Trump then named him head of Homeland Security after Kirstjen Nielsen resigned Sunday. Although several outlets have reported the conversation citing anonymous sources, the context of the pardon promise changes a bit depending on who is doing the reporting. CNN, for example, says Trump vowed to “ pardon him if he ever went to jail for denying US entry to migrants .” The New York Times, however, said the pardon promise came as the two were talking about closing the southern border entirely . Everybody does note though that it wasn’t necessarily clear whether Trump was joking. Although Trump had threatened to close the border earlier this month, he later backtracked and said he would give Mexico one year before taking such drastic action . Homeland Security issued a statement that doesn’t quite deny Trump’s promise of a pardon.“At no time has the President indicated, asked, directed or pressured the Acting Secretary to do anything illegal,” the department said in a statement. “Nor would the Acting Secretary take actions that are not in accordance with our responsibility to enforce the law.” Trump also denied that he offered the pardon. “Of course this is not true,” he wrote on Twitter . “Mainstream Media is corrupt and getting worse, if that is possible, every day!” Another Fake Story on @NBCNews that I offered Pardons to Homeland Securiy personnel in case they broke the law regarding illegal immigration and sanctuary cities. Of course this is not true. Mainstream Media is corrupt and getting worse, if that is possible, every day! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2019 Support our journalism

Trump tax returns: Democrats give IRS new deadline of April 23.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-tax-returns-irs-new-deadline-april-23.html,"Notre Dame Cathedral Is on Fire House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal made clear Saturday that Democrats in the House of Representatives are not giving up on their demand to see President Donald Trump’s tax returns . Neal reiterated his demand for Trump’s tax returns, telling IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig in a letter that he has until April 23 to turn over the files. The move amounts to a rebuke of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who had said he wasn’t even sure that Neal had the authority to make the request in the first place. “I expect a reply from the IRS by 5:00 p.m. on April 23, 2019. Please know that if you fail to comply, your failure will be interpreted as a denial of my request,” Neal wrote in the letter that came days after Mnuchin said there was no way the administration could meet the original April 10 deadline. In the letter, Neal pushed back against Mnuchin’s questions about whether lawmakers had the oversight authority to make what the treasury secretary had characterized as “unprecedented” request. “The Committee’s request raises serious issues concerning the constitutional scope of Congressional investigative authority, the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose, and the constitutional rights of American citizens,” Mnuchin wrote . “The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically-motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power.” Neal said he wasn’t buying that rationale. “I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding my request, and the authority of the committee. Those concerns lack merit. Moreover, judicial precedent commands that none of the concerns raised can legitimately be used to deny the committee’s request,” Neal wrote. The hard deadline aspect of Neal’s letter is significant because it seems inevitable the request will turn into a long legal battle . If the administration denied the request then that could set the stage for a subpoena or a lawsuit. So far though, no one has denied the request outright. Neal also spells out in the letter why the request “falls squarely within the Committee’s oversight authority” and said that any questions of the motives behind the demand for documents were unacceptable. “It is not the proper function of the IRS, Treasury, or Justice to question or second guess the motivations of the Committee or its reasonable determinations regarding its need for the requested tax returns and return information,” Neal wrote.

WikiLeaks confirms Julian Assange’s cat is “safe.”,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/wikileaks-confirms-julian-assange-cat-safe.html,"Notre Dame Cathedral Is on Fire WikiLeaks put an end to the mystery. Julian Assange’s cat is safe and sound. “We can confirm that Assange’s cat is safe,” the organization said Saturday in a tweet . “Assange asked his lawyers to rescue him from embassy threats in mid-October. They will be reunited in freedom.” The question about the whereabouts of Assange’s cat had spread like wildfire on social media after he was arrested Thursday in London . Assange got the cat in 2016, purportedly to keep him company as he spent his days inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. The cat gained quite a bit of a following on social media under the moniker, Embassy Cat , described as the master of “counter-purveillance.” In an interview with The New Yorker, Assange had said he called the cat Michi or Cat/stro.

"Donald Glover and Rihanna in Guava Island, reviewed.",slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/donald-glover-rihanna-guava-island-childish-gambino-letitia-wright-reviewed.html,"This isn’t America. Amazon Studios Guava Island , Amazon Prime’s Donald Glover–produced musical film , hit the streaming service Saturday morning, and it isn’t very good. Although the secretive production and limited free-streaming window suggested Glover—musical stage name Childish Gambino—was working on a project like Lemonade, it turns out the main thing Glover took from Beyoncé was the marketing plan. Instead of a coherent piece of art in which sound and image trace and deepen the same thematic paths, Guava Island, in which Glover plays a musician trying to put on a festival against the wishes of a local despot, is a collection of unrelated, mostly previously released songs indifferently stitched together by a hokey narrative. (The complete lack of chemistry between Glover and his costar Rihanna—who doesn’t sing in the movie—doesn’t help.) There’s nothing wrong with reverse-engineering a movie from its music—see, e.g., the greatest musical of all time —and the rustic Cuban locations are lovely, but screenwriter Stephen Glover and director Hiro Murai mostly spend their time making excuses for launching into songs that are unrelated to what’s happening on screen. For example, here’s the awkward monologue Glover has to deliver in order to shoehorn in a new arrangement of his hit “This is America” into Guava Island , which is set on Guava Island, a place that does not exist anywhere, but especially does not exist in America:
This is America. Guava’s no different than any other country. America is a concept. Anywhere where in order to get rich, you have to make someone else richer, is America. The seams show, to put it mildly. You don’t have to have seen The Hollywood Revue of 1929 to appreciate Singin’ in the Rain —in fact, it’s easier if you haven’t!—but it’d be impossible to appreciate Guava Island ’s musique concrète version of “This Is America” without knowing the original music video , a much sharper fusion of sound and image that was also directed by Hiro Murai. It’s unclear why any of the talents involved wanted to stage a less-effective version of something they got right the first time, but whatever their motivations, Guava Island is the very definition of a derivative work. And it’s derived from many works. Advance material for Guava Island namechecked City of God and Purple Rain , but Black Orpheus , The Harder They Come , and even Dancer in the Dark have space on the production’s mood board. The affinities go beyond plot and setting: Cinematographer Christian Sprenger layers film grain and scratches over a sun-faded palette for a 16mm aesthetic, even rounding the corners of the narrow frame to evoke home movie projectors . This was almost certainly done in post-production: The credits say the film was shot digitally, and Spengler managed something similar on Atlanta by making a film print of his episode, then rescanning it . But the effect is slightly marred by a precise, shallow focus that doesn’t quite match Guava Island ’s other low-budget signifiers. And speaking of shallow focus, Guava Island ’s story is full of it. From the animated opening, in which Rihanna explains the suspiciously Lorax-like backstory of the island and her dream of “a new life, free from survival,” to the groanworthy final voiceover, nothing in Guava Island ’s 55-minute runtime stands up to a minute’s thought, despite valiant efforts from supporting actors Letitia Wright and Nonso Anozie. There’s something about the entire project that’s backwards: Murai’s “This Is America” video made Glover’s music sharper and more specific; Guava Island glops up the same music with a half-baked allegory that dulls every note.

"Taylor Swift's website has a countdown clock on it and on April 26, she will reveal our fate.",slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/taylor-swift-website-countdown-clock.html,"A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Apr 13, 2019 at 8:39am PDT The internet has been ablaze with rumors ever since the countdown clock appeared, most of which revolve around the idea that Swift might be releasing new music on the 26 th . But students of history and students of the Assassin’s Creed video game series recognize that the situation is far grimmer than even the lead-up to the release of Reputation . April 26 is the anniversary of the Pazzi’s attack on the Medici outside the Duomo in Florence, making it an apt day for betrayals and treason. And this isn’t the first time a monomaniacal multi-millionaire with a love of gadgets , a passion for revenge , and a stockpile of diamonds has started a ticking clock. For more on this, here’s a crucial scene from the 1971 Cold War documentary Diamonds Are Forever : We could spend the time between now and April 26 trying to dig fallout shelters deep enough to protect us from Taylor Swift’s diamond-powered death laser satellite array. We could spend it trying to raise whatever ransom Swift is planning to demand. We could even try to get Sean Connery to put on the old tuxedo one last time and sneak onto Taylor Swift’s diamond-powered death laser satellite array control center, which if memory serves should be on an unused oil platform somewhere. But these efforts will be futile. True wisdom lies in embracing the arrival of Taylor Swift’s death laser satellites, and living a life of guilt-free hedonism and sin until the scorching red hot light of the pop star’s newest project turns every water molecule in your body into steam at the exact same time.

"SNL: Emma Stone parodies a meticulous parody of Klymaxx's ""Meeting in the Ladies Room.""",slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/snl-klymaxx-meeting-ladies-room-parody-emma-stone-original-video.html,"Is it real, or was it all a wonderful dream? Klymaxx / NBC Say what you will about Saturday Night Live, no one can deny that the current cast and crew have exquisite taste in pop culture detritus. In December, Kyle Mooney and Beck Bennett restaged an entire episode of Full House , and last spring, the show aired a painstaking parody of Oran “Juice” Jones’ creepy video for “The Rain .” And this week, for no apparent reason, SNL meticulouslyrecreated the music video for “Meeting in the Ladies Room,” a truly bizarre single with an even more bizarre music video. Here’s the original, which you will not believe is real but very much is real: Again, that was an actual music video that aired on actual television. (For confirmation that this is a real thing from the 1980s and not a hoax created by Saturday Night Live to justify filming their own version, consult the full page ad on page 9 of the “Friday” section of the Chicago Tribune of May 10, 1985, in which you will find Meeting in the Ladies Room listed as a “Downtown Records Cash Saver.”) Not only was this a real song, it was really on the soundtrack to a real movie, 1985’s Secret Admirer , featuring 2019 supervillain Lori Loughlin: Naturally, there was nothing for Saturday Night Live to do but have the cast and this week’s host Emma Stone faithfully recreate the music video, complete with the amazing “LADIE’S ROOM” neon sign. OK, so the ending isn’t exactly how the original video played out, but Saturday Night Live has still done something invaluable here: They’ve reminded Americans that we belong to a proud culture that, at our civilization’s height, was capable of producing masterpieces like the “Meeting in the Ladies Room” video by Klymaxx. We owe it to the memory of our noble ancestors to create art today that, although it seems unremarkable to us now, will be just as hilarious in 2053 as “Meeting in the Ladies Room” is in 2019. If we don’t, Season 78 of Saturday Night Live is going to be a real drag. "
"SNL Cold Open: Lori Loughlin, Julian Assange, Tekashi 6ix9ine, and Michael Avenatti meet in prison.",slate.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/snl-cold-open-keaton-loughlin-assange-6ix9ine-avenatti.html,"What do you mean these aren’t the Star Wars auditions? NBC Saturday Night Live hires so many talented impressionists that any sketch premise that allows the cast to assemble a collection of faux famous people— celebrity game shows , movie screen tests , Ariana Grande holding a microphone —is almost guaranteed to become a recurring segment. So it is good news for both SNL and civil society in general that this week, the most obvious way for the show to fill a room with celebrities was to set the cold open in prison. Until quite recently, it would have been difficult to imagine circumstances that would put Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti, Full House star Lori Loughlin, and rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine in the same place at the same time. But in the last few months, Loughlin was criminally charged for her involvement in a college admissions cheating scandal , Assange got evicted from London’s Ecuadorian Embassy and now faces extradition, Tekashi 6ix9ine pled guilty to federal racketeering charges , and Avenatti was indicted for what can only be described as a crime spree . It’s a new era for celebrity accountability, which means it’s also a new era for Saturday Night Live celebrity impression sketches: It is a rare treat these days to see Kate McKinnon do an impression without extensive makeup, and Pete Davidson, who rarely gets much to do in sketches, pulls off an entire monologue without breaking. But the star is undoubtedly Michael Keaton as a gum-chewing Assange, strutting around the holding cell boasting about being the “King of Chaos” and the “Scourge of the Cleaning Staff at the Ecuadorian Embassy.” The only thing more fun than playing a Bond villain is playing an incompetent Bond villain, and Keaton is having the time of his life. Most of all, it’s fun to see a group of SNL celebrity impressions bouncing off each other without anyone having to play Jeopardy! It’s going to be complicated to weigh the evils that come from mass incarceration against the benefits we might reap from finally making some famous people follow some of the laws, but one thing is clear: Imprisoning as many rich and powerful people as possible will only make Saturday Night Live funnier.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal filed a formal request for Trump’s tax returns earlier this month for six years of Trump’s tax returns. He made the request to the IRS citing a little-known tax statute from the 1920s.

Tiger Woods wins the 2019 Masters.

That’s a partial list of what’s occurred in Tiger Woods’ life since he last won a major at the 2008 U.S. Open. He’s 43 years old now. And he just won the Masters for the first time in 14 years, his 15 th career major victory. You choose the hyperbole of where this achievement ranks in Masters history, golf history, and sports history. But it’s pretty high in all of those! I did not think he would win heading into Sunday, where play was moved up to the morning to beat afternoon thunderstorms. He’d never won a major without having at least a share of the third-round lead, and he trailed the third-round leader, Francesco Molinari, by two strokes. Molinari, the reigning British Open champion, played the first three rounds like the best player in the world, making only one bogey over 54 holes. And Brooks Koepka, the reigning U.S. Open and PGA Championship winner, trailed Tiger by only one shot entering Sunday. Molinari and Koepka had faced runs from Woods in the previous two major championships and successfully stiff-armed him away. They were not scared of him. Woods’ early-round play on Sunday, as it had been all week, was dicey. He bogeyed the monstrous par-4 fifth hole for the fourth straight day.* He missed a couple putts from inside 10 feet. Molinari hit a fair share of uncharacteristically sloppy shots, but he always found a way to recover. And then the par-3 12th hole happened. Both Molinari and Tony Finau, the third member of the final group, went for the hole and lost their tee shots into the water. Both made double bogey. Koepka, playing in the group ahead, had also put it in the water on 12 for a double bogey. This is the classicAugusta mistake, and Tiger’s main competitors fell for it. Woods, meanwhile, parked his shot in the middle of the green, about 50 feet away, for a two-putt and a share of the lead. Molinari and Woods held each other in sight until the 15th, a par 5 protected in front by water. Tiger, from about 230 yards, put his second shot in the middle of the green—this was one of many moments during Sunday’s final round where I exhaled deeply after dangerously intermittent breathing over the course of several minutes—and two-putted for birdie. Molinari chunked his third into the water and was done. Woods had the lead to himself. Then, on the par-3 16 th , he dropped the dagger. Aside from the 18 th hole celebration, this is the moment we’ll remember from the tournament.

When his birdie putt on 18 missed low, though, Tiger got to walk down the final fairway with a two-stroke lead. He chipped it up and tapped in for a bogey to win by one. The scene, when he tapped in the last putt, was indescribable. Tiger Woods has won the Masters. His 81st PGA TOUR win.His 15th major title. — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) April 14, 2019 Woods was asked after his round where this win ranked among all of his 81 PGA Tour wins and 15 major championships. Is it better than the 1997 Masters, his first major? The 2000 U.S. Open, where he won by 15, in what’s generally considered the greatest four-day performance in the sport’s history? The 2008 U.S. Open, which he won on the 91st hole with one functioning leg? “It’s gotta be up there, right?” he said. Right. Maybe even at the top.
Correction: This story misstated par on the fifth hole. It’s a par 4, not a par 5."

The cassowary, which is similar to an emu, killed 75-year-old Marvin Hajos on Friday near Gainesville. The Alachua County Fire Rescue Department said the bird appears to have attacked Hajos when he fell and likely killed him using its long claws. “It looks like it was accidental. My understanding is that the gentleman was in the vicinity of the bird and at some point fell. When he fell, he was attacked,” Deputy Chief Jeff Taylor told the Gainesville Sun . Although an investigation has been opened, officials said that it looks like the death was accidental. “Initial information indicates that this was a tragic accident for Mr. Hajos,” said Lt. Brett Rhodenizer, a sheriff’s office spokesman, in an email to the paper. “The cassowary involved remains secured on private property at this time.” The San Diego Zoo’s website describes the cassowary as dangerous and points out just what makes this bird that can weigh up to 130 pounds so deadly: “The cassowary is rightfully considered the most dangerous bird in the world! Each 3-toed foot has a dagger-like claw on the inner toe that is up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) long! The cassowary can slice open any predator or potential threat with a single swift kick.” Although people eat cassowaries in New Guinea, those who have the bird in the United States are likely to be hobbyists."

At the rally in his hometown, Buttigieg said he was well aware that his candidacy was more than a little unconventional. “My name is Pete Buttigieg. They call me Mayor Pete,” Buttigieg said to cheers from the crowd that had packed a former factory. “I recognize the audacity of doing this as a Midwestern millennial mayor. More than a little bold—at age 37—to seek the highest office in the land,” he said. “But we live in a moment that compels us each to act.” Buttigieg characterized his campaign as the opposite of President Trump and his slogan while using his hometown’s turnaround as an example of what he can accomplish t. “There’s a long way for us to go. Life here is far from perfect. But we’ve changed our trajectory and shown a path forward for communities like ours. And that’s why I’m here today. To tell a different story than ‘Make America Great Again,’” Buttigieg said . “Because there is a myth being sold to industrial and rural communities: the myth that we can stop the clock and turn it back.” Pete Buttigieg said he's running for president to tell ""a different story than 'Make America Great Again.'""""They're selling an impossible promise to return to a bygone era that was never as great as advertised to begin with."" https://t.co/AtDPVOMJpc pic.twitter.com/kHA9rsIoZq — CBS News (@CBSNews) April 14, 2019 In his speech, Buttigieg characterized his candidacy as more than just a race for the highest office in the land. “The forces of change in our country today are tectonic,” he said . “Forces that help to explain what made this current presidency even possible. That’s why, this time, it’s not just about winning an election—it’s about winning an era.” Buttigieg: ""Until recently this was not exactly what I had in mind, either, for how I was going to spend my 8th year as mayor & my 38th year in this world. But we live in a moment that compels us each to act ... It's not just about winning an election, it's about winning an era."" pic.twitter.com/NfkFzKhbAp — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 14, 2019 Buttigieg has managed to raise $7 million in the first three months of the year, which is less than half of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ $18 million but still more than several national figures running for office, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey. Such a touching moment between Pete Buttigieg and his husband Chasten.

Trump Ilhan Omar video: Fox’s Wallace only “comfortable” playing five seconds of Trump’s “horrible” Omar video.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-ilhan-omar-video-fox-wallace-five-seconds.html,"Notre Dame Cathedral Is on Fire: The Spire Has Collapsed, but the Towers Will Survive White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders went on Fox News Sunday and host Chris Wallace wanted to talk to her about a video that President Donald Trump tweeted attacking Rep. Ilhan Omar. But the video itself is so “horrible” that Wallace refused to play it for more than five seconds on the show . Wallace introduced the video to begin questioning Sanders on Trump’s attack against the freshman lawmaker. But he quickly cut it off. “Now, that was the only five seconds we felt comfortable showing,” Wallace said . “It goes on in a much worse way for about 43 seconds, of her seeming, no question about it, to minimize 9/11, and then horrible images from 911.” Wallace then went on to ask why the president is “comfortable putting out horrible images like that” before asking whether the president isn’t worried about inciting violence against Omar or Muslims in general. Sanders ignored the first question and went straight for the second, vehemently denying the president could be inciting violence. “Certainly nothing could be further from the truth,” Sanders responded. “The president is not trying to incite violence against anybody.” She then went on to characterize Omar’s remarks as “disgusting and abhorrent.”"
Madonna's new album Madame X: The pop star releases a video teasing her next album.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/madonna-madame-x-teaser-new-album-new-persona.html,"Intelligence experts now believe that Madonna’s world tours were cover stories for Madame X’s secret missions. Madonna Pop star Madonna released a first look at her upcoming album and newest persona on social media on Sunday. They’re both called Madame X , and this time around she’s going for a secret agent vibe. In the teaser, over an excerpt from some of her upcoming music, Madonna appears in a variety of costumes that allude to past personae, from an eyepatch and tie ensemble that gives off Mistress Dita vibes to a “Music”-style cowboy hat . She also seems to be very concerned about leaving fingerprints: The video shows her using a vintage typewriter while wearing slippery black leather gloves and playing guitar—steel-stringed!—in lace gloves, complete with soon-to-be-shredded fingertips. Madonna has reinvented herself so many times that virtually any collection of clothing you could put her in would include a few things that look like allusions to her past, but the voiceover suggests the pop star is working on a unified theory of her past alter egos. It turns out she was a spy all along!
I decided to call my record Madame X . Madame X is a secret agent traveling around the world. Changing identities. Bringing light to dark places. Madame X is a dancer. A professor. A head of state. An equestrian. A prisoner. A student. A mother. A child. A teacher. A nun. A singer. A saint. A whore. And a spy in the house of love. I’m Madame X. Sunday’s Instagram tease is the first time Madonna has proclaimed herself Madame X, but she is only the latest in a long line of Mesdames X. Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau didn’t have a choice in the matter—John Singer Sargent named the painting —but Alexandre Bisson’s 1908 play by that name and its many, many adaptations meant that for a while, there was a new Madame X every few years. Bisson’s Madame X wasn’t much of an aspirational figure, though: She is thrown out of her home by her husband and separated from her young son after having an affair. Years later, her son—who doesn’t know her—becomes the Attorney General, then ends up being unknowingly assigned to prosecute her for a murder she committed to protect her son from scandal. But if Madame X the character was not exactly aspirational, Madame X the lead role was something everyone wanted. When melodrama was still a thing, the play was an astonishingly popular text to adapt for the screen: movies were made in 1910 , 1916 , 1918 , 1920 , 1929 , 1931 , 1937 , 1948 , 1952 , 1955 , 1956 , 1966 , and 1981 —and that’s not even counting the stage or radio versions . Pre-Madonna Mesdames X include Oda Nielsen, Dorothy Donnelly, Emilia Márkus, Pauline Frederick, Ruth Chatterton, María Fernanda Ladrón de Guevara, Gladys George, Mara Russell-Tavernan, Gloria Romero, Lale Oraloglu, Kyveli, Lana Turner, and Tuesday Weld. Here’s how Lana Turner announced she was Madame X: Madonna is also not the first Madame X in music, at least with some allowances for spelling. There was also Madam X, the hair metal band behind classic anthem slash adolescence survival guide, “High in High School.” The video starred a very young Peter Dinklage, years before Game of Thrones : Judging from the music in Madonna’s post, her new album is probably not a sonic journey to the days of hair metal, nor will it be supported by a series of videos in which high school students are saved from boredom when Madonna crashes the classroom or dining room and teaches everyone—including the stuffy teacher or parent, possibly also played by Madonna—how to party. On the other hand, the new music sounds pretty good! No release date has been announced yet, but given Madame X’s chameleon-like talent for disguises, we should all keep a careful lookout."
"Trump’s campaign raises $30 million in first quarter, far outpacing Democrats.",slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-campaign-raises-30-million-first-quarter.html,"Notre Dame Cathedral Is on Fire: The Spire Has Collapsed, but the Towers Will Survive President Donald Trump raised more than $30 million for his re-election bid in the first three months of the year, according to his campaign. That means the commander in chief now has $40.8 million of cash on hand , which amounts to a record at this stage of the race and is far higher than any of the Democratic hopefuls. In fact, it is more than the combined total of what the top two candidates raised considering Sen. Bernie Sanders got $18.2 million and Sen. Kamala Harris, $12 million. Trump’s number is even greater when you take into account that the Republican National Committee has raised $45.8 million. The huge number can in part be explained because Trump enjoys the traditional incumbent advantage. But the president also began raising money much earlier than his predecessors.There’s concern within Democratic circles that while Democrats fight among themselves in the primary, Trump will continue building up his war chest to give him a huge advantage once the general campaign starts. That is what the Trump team seems to be hoping for as well with a senior campaign official telling NBC News that after the primary “we expect them to be bruised, battered, and broke.” Trump worked to set up his re-election effort shortly after he moved into the White House and he became the first president to ever file his re-election paperwork on the same day as his inauguration. The president’s fundraising effort is trying to woo big donors, of course, but it is also aiming to obtain small donations from supporters. And the effort appears to be working. Almost 99 percent of donations to Trump in the first quarter were for $200 or less and the average contribution was a mere $34.26. Trump’s reelection campaign has the goal of raising a total of $1 billion for the 2020 contest. Support our journalism

"Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode 1, reviewed.",slate.com,Willa Paskin,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-season-8-premiere-review.html,"This Week’s Worst Person in Westeros: Jon Snow Game of Thrones was once a rapidly expanding universe, a story that added characters, locations, storylines, and complications as if it had no outer limit. New continents popped up in the architectural models of the opening credits; dynastic families with their own convoluted histories were cavalierly introduced; major characters died in gruesome circumstances with jarring frequency, fracturing the story further still. But what once expanded must now contract. Game of Thrones is ending, and though the brutal course of human history never stops, stories do. You don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay in Westeros (at least, not until the prequels ). In the blandly decent first episode of the final season, Game of Thrones started flicking the lights, putting characters in place for whatever comes next, while running through a number of long-awaited reunions and first-time meetings. It was less an episode and more a breadcrumb, leading us to the next breadcrumb, which will lead us to the next one, until said breadcrumbs get scorched by dragons, destroyed by White Walkers, or sliced up in some other internecine dispute—and on and on, until we come to the end. As a critic, I have never felt like I was tilting at windmills more than when I have written about whether Game of Thrones is actually good or not , whether its increasingly slavish devotion to what comes next has undermined the show, and if it has set itself up to disappoint by putting so much pressure on the final outcome. We’re all watching, and no one wants to hear it . Besides, as a person who has also devoted umpteen hours to Game of Thrones , I, too, would very much like to know what happens next. As far as I am concerned, the big extant question about Game of Thrones , the TV show—bigger than all the billions of tiny questions about the arcane cosmology of its universe—is whether or not it will turn out to be a Bad Fan of Game of Thrones , the books. Will it try to provide some kind of morally uplifting narrative closure, or will it end in moral uncertainty? Will the show give us a schmoopy happy ending that completely undermines the ideas that have animated the series, or will it give us a morally gnarly resolution that doesn’t?

For my money, the best scene in the episode (also the only one in which anything really happened) was when Sam told Jon he’s “always been the king of the Seven Kingdoms.” I didn’t love it because it was so rousing, but because it was so messed up. What if, after all of this, Game of Thrones is just a long defense of the idea that blood really should confer power on some people and not others, even when that blood is known to belong to enlightened despots and genocidal pyromaniacs? What if Game of Thrones gives viewers a happy ending it believes is happy, but is actually an advertisement for continued tyranny? The possibility made my blood run colder than the jump-fright provided by that chopped-up ice zombie. Momentum, the idea that we are hurtling toward some conclusion that will explain it all, has been so encoded into the Game of Thrones experience that in the absence of any forward motion, the show is … kind of dull. To zip it up for myself, I turned the episode into another kind of parlor game, ranking all of the episode’s pas de deux, first meetings, long-awaited reunions. This list, obviously, is definitive. 1. Sam and Dany This first encounter was very good because it was very bad. Cheery, friendly princess of the people Dany tries her best to appeal to her boyfriend’s BFF, but fails miserably when she has to reveal to an increasingly distraught Samwell Tarly that she murdered his father and his brother. Ooops. Sam, one of the show’s most reliable barometers of real morality, met Dany and found her wanting. 2. Sansa and Tyrion While I think that “rooting” for anyone to “win” is genuinely antithetical to the entire meaning of the show, I am … totally rooting for Sansa, so I like it when she gets to be wise and embittered and neg Tyrion. 3. Theon and Yara Weirdly, given how generally inscrutable and boring I find the Iron Islands plotline to be, I found this reunion moving. I’m glad Theon is pulling his tattered psyche together in time to go sacrifice himself for the Starks. 4. Arya and the Hound The problem with all of Arya’s encounters with friends and frenemies from her past is that she is so twisted and morally enervated she can’t experience joy or happiness outside the context of bloody revenge. But the Hound is also twisted and morally enervated, so their affectionate show of mutual disdain was fairly satisfying. 5. Arya and Gendry I was not expecting my rom-com banter to come from Arya and Gendry—“I always knew you were just another rich girl”; “You don’t know any other rich girls”—but no complaints. 6. Jon and Arya Should have been moving! Was not! Also downgraded this scene because having two sequences in a row reference Sansa and intelligence is a bad sign for Sansa, whom I am not rooting for except that I am. 7. Dany and Sansa Game of Thrones —despite the sexposition that is somehow still happening —has more interesting, knotty female characters than it does male ones. And yet the groundwork is being laid for the show to devolve into a Dany vs. Sansa catfight, with Jon as the dope between them. Not feeling it. 8. Jon and the Dragon Aka an advertisement for a future theme park ride. 9. Bran and Jon “You’re a man!” Jon tells Bran, who is, in fact, a cardboard statue. 10. Bran and Jaime This was the record-scratch ending of the episode: Bran and Jaime laying eyes on each other for the first time since Jaime tossed Bran out a window, paralyzing him, in the show’s first episode. It would pack more punch if Bran was still Bran, and not a monotonous, all-seeing automaton."

Game of Thrones season eight premiere recap: The Night King can't get here fast enough.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-season-eight-winterfell-recap-where-is-the-night-king.html,"¯\_(ツ)_/¯ HBO Game of Thrones returned for its final season on Sunday night, and although there are still several episodes left for the show to redeem itself, it’s hard to see the season premiere, “Winterfell,” as anything but a step backward. The episode exemplifies one of the most frustrating things about Game of Thrones : Whenever it seems to find its focus and start moving the plot along (see, e.g., “Hardhome” or “The Dragon and the Wolf”), the writers almost immediately plunge back into internecine quarrels between the villains, which, as the show itself keeps reminding us, don’t matter at all in the face of the Night King and his army of the dead. The Season 8 opener wasn’t all jawing and moving pieces on the board around, but many significant moments happened off screen. And it’s never a great sign when an episode’s most thrilling scenes—soldiers encircling a group of wildlings, a majestic dragon in flight, White Walkers on the march—all come during the “Previously On” section. Still, someone’s got to set the dominoes up before they get knocked over, and director David Nutter and screenwriter David Hill do a superb job of establishing a sense of impending conflict in the opening scene. It’s sort of a riff on the “ All Gold Canyon ” chapter of The Ballad of Buster Scruggs : We see a beautiful pastoral landscape—snow on the quiet forest floor, a stream that’s just about to freeze—invaded by a single child, sprinting across the frozen ground. As the camera follows him, more and more of the natural world is replaced by signs of man, until he encounters other people, first individually, then in groups, then in an impassable crowd. The camera finally pulls back as the child climbs a tree, revealing a vast army of the living marching into Winterfell. The shot evokes the end of Ivan the Terrible, Part I , which doesn’t speak well of the mental state of Winterfell’s leadership, and the crane shot from Gone With the Wind , which doesn’t speak well of anyone’s chances against the White Walkers. It’s an extremely efficient machine for producing dread. Unfortunately, that’s one of the last sparks of excitement in the episode. Hill and Nutter seem to know they’re going to have a hard time keeping the audience interested while very little is happening, because they have a character interrupt two other characters’ pointless exchange of formalities with this preview of coming attractions:
We don’t have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon. He’s one of them now. The wall has fallen. The dead march south. But nobody listens, least of all the filmmakers, because there are still 50-odd minutes of the episode to fill, and they’re mostly filled with squabbling. It’s important for Game of Thrones to establish that the fractious human factions in Westeros are ill-prepared to face a unified, disciplined force like the Night King’s army, but eight seasons in, the point has already been made. And “Winterfell” is so dedicated to presenting every conceivable character pairing that it sometimes feels like watching a Punnett square. It finally seems like something is going to happen when fan favorite the Mountain—easily the most likable character south of the wall—moves to interrupt an assignation between two other characters. But it’s a cruel fakeout: Not only does the Mountain not kill anyone, the very next scene is a return to the show’s absolute worst Season 1 tendencies: It’s set in a brothel for no discernable reason besides filling the frame with creamy, unmarred, warm human skin, without a single exposed rib cage or dangling jawbone to keep things decent. There have got to be better ways to evoke the horrors the Night King rides against without this kind of gratuitous exploitation.

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. It’s not until a visit to Last Hearth, the ancestral home of House Umber, that Hill and Nutter find their footing. The lighting is finally as dark as it should be , and after an episode filled with warm hearths and flickering candles, it’s a relief to see a snowy courtyard take on a welcoming blue tint in the freezing night air. The scene takes place shortly after a battle, which strongly suggests that some of the money that paid for hours and hours of incomprehensible human muttering would have been better spent getting the Night King’s victory at Last Hearth on screen. Nevertheless, it’s still stirring to see pools of blood staining the snow red, and it was a smart move, particularly in an episode as grim as “Winterfell,” to reassure the audience that the series isn’t going to spend the entire season wallowing in miserabilism. Better yet, after an episode dedicated to old enemies, Hill and Nutter give the audience a new friend at last, a blue-eyed charmer of perhaps 12 years of age who lives on a wall in the basement of Castle Umber surrounded by a gorgeous spiral of severed limbs. But Game of Thrones didn’t get its reputation for narrative cruelty for no reason, and if you were expecting a happy ending, you probably should have watched Melancholia . Seconds after the show introduces the most promising character in several seasons , he is run through with a flaming sword and dies in the worst way imaginable: warm, surrounded by people who care about him, and miles from the nearest wight or zombie. It makes sense to emphasize human cruelty as the show heads toward its final confrontation between good and evil, but it’s brutal to watch a life end so painfully when it had only just begun. Sadism toward the audience aside, however, the main point of a season premiere on a highly serialized show like Game of Thrones is to provide the heroes with motivation for their battles to come. When the Night King finds out about the atrocity at Last Hearth, his righteous anger should be enough to power an entire season. Let’s just hope the good guys get a little more screen time next week.

Vaccination discussions can’t just be about science-based medicine.,slate.com,Gregory E. Kaebnick,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/vaccination-values-science-based-policy.html,"Police Are Making Tone-Deaf Memes to Build Community Trust Policy debates about scientific topics have an infuriating habit of seeming to disregard the obvious facts. That’s what makes recent developments in the debate about childhood vaccination so tantalizing. With record-high cases of measles around the world generating media attention, the Senate holding hearings about the dangers of the anti-vaccination movement, and Facebook adopting new rules for vaccine-related content , it seems we might be on the verge of squelching vaccine misinformation . Perhaps clear, concise, and evidence-based answers to questions about vaccine safety along with some myth busting can sort everything out after all. But getting the facts right is not the most important part of the debate. When confronted with evidence that the vaccines are safe and effective, opponents find a way to raise doubts . They present their own facts , demand unrealistic evidentiary standards—rock-solid proof of 100 percent safety—and question the integrity of those producing the evidence. Before we can make a meaningful dent in the number of people who refuse to vaccinate their children, we have to accept that “because science” won’t convince anyone. At the end of the day, it’s values—beliefs about what matters, what’s important, what should guide our lives and societies—that are most important. Values are not ignored in the vaccine debate; claims about parents’ rights and harms to children are common. But too often, the pro-vaccination discourse fails to recognize or thoroughly explore the role they play in the discussion, and in parents’ minds. Whether it’s doctors talking to patients, experts writing for the public, public health messages designed to increase the vaccination rate, or ordinary citizens posting on Facebook, just arguing about the facts won’t get at what’s really driving debate. What we see in the debate about vaccines is not unique, of course. Think climate change , for example, where debate focuses on the effects of greenhouse gases (spawning a further debate about what counts as good science). Or genetically modified organisms , where the central issue is consumers’ health. In these debates, too, it’s not enough to explain the facts and debunk the misconceptions. Although measures to slow the spread of misinformation can be helpful, “myth busting” and appeals for “science-based” policymaking usually are not. Some of the better-recognized reasons for this phenomenon are rooted in human psychology. There is an enormous literature on the various cognitive biases that cause people to see and understand the world in ways that may not square with the facts. Confirmation bias—the tendency to accept facts that fit our prior beliefs—is thought to be particularly important in the vaccine debate , but other biases (aversion loss, status quo bias) may also play a role. Such biases are typically regarded with disdain and despair, but the important point is not really that people are bad at thinking. It’s that what they feel strongly about—their values—helps guide them as they navigate the world. There are also social reasons. People can be classified according to the set of basic values that motivate them, and differences across these value sets probably drive some of the disagreement in the science debates. Some people care more than others about cleanliness and purity, for example, and research suggests that they tend to dislike vaccines more strongly. Such concerns, reflecting views about human nature and the relationship of humans to the rest of nature, might lie submerged in political claims about parents’ rights—the simpler political values motivated by the more intricate and obscure values. Because they are in part matters of upbringing and culture, basic value sets are closely connected to personal identity and group allegiance, generating another influence on cognition: Somebody seen as challenging views that define one’s “tribe” is unlikely to get a fair hearing. And finally, social and economic trends have spawned a deep distrust, on both the right and left, of expertise, privilege, and power. And with good reason: The public has legitimate interests in asking challenging, even distrusting, questions about who’s in control of the scientific enterprise. Other, less widely discussed reasons have to do with the very nature of facts. First, as the political theorist Deborah Stone explains in her influential book Policy Paradox: The Art of Political Decision Making , “facts do not exist independent of interpretive lenses, they come clothed in words and numbers.” The point is not that every fact is a changeable social construction; it’s that most interesting phenomena can be described and explained in many contrasting ways, and the descriptions and explanations we end up with can vary according to the questions we’re asking. Whether a vaccine is better described as a well-tested tool for preventing disease or a foreign incursion into the body may hang on whether you’re comparing it to medical interventions or to causes of disease and disability. When vaccine opponents ask about the standards of evidence, they’re not just being obstructionist. What counts as “good enough” evidence is a question of interpretation, influenced by the comparisons that dominate their thinking. Second, the facts about socially important issues are almost always contestable, and how they support moral and political judgments sometimes depends on the weight we give them—which is to say, on the values we attach to them. Which is worse: a low-likelihood but high-impact outcome like an allergic reaction, or a high-likelihood but low-impact outcome like the ouchie your kid will get from the needle? A cost-benefit analysis, that paradigm of policy rationality, might assign equal weight to these outcomes, but must everyone see it that way ? And come to think of it, how “low-impact” is it that you are consciously allowing someone to hurt your child? Some parents are untroubled; others find it very difficult. (Similar questions arise in other debates. If you care about the effect of genetically modified crops on nature, which matters more: that insect resistance can lead to lower herbicide use, or that a plant’s genetic code has been “hacked”?) The result of all this is that, although measures to slow the spread of misinformation can be helpful , “myth busting” and appeals for “science-based” policymaking usually are not. They are often just efforts to shut down one’s opponents in a way likely to be deeply threatening and infuriating to them. At best, they ignore what’s most important. While the debaters dwell on facts, what drives them apart are competing values about (for example) personal liberty, political power, human nature, science and technology, the relationships of individuals to society and of humans to the rest of nature, and the weights assigned to different kinds of harms and benefits, and even to uncertainty. Facts inform policy, but values are the basis. To have a better debate, we need to change how we communicate with the people we’re trying to persuade. The approach we should take will likely vary depending on the relationship and the audience. A doctor-patient interaction is different from a televised debate with a vaccine skeptic, for example, and a vocal and determined vaccine denier is extremely unlikely to be won over. Before an audience of the merely vaccine-hesitant, emphasizing the scientific consensus and correcting misconceptions may yet be helpful, if it’s done just right . In all contexts, though, we should find ways to express and elicit underlying values. There’s helpful advice in the nascent literature on how experts should talk to the public . Some of this advice can come across as vaguely disingenuous and manipulative: Experts can “nudge” people into accepting the facts by framing the conversation appropriately; cognitive biases can be turned in the scientists’ favor; establishing a personal connection with an audience is a first step in winning them over. But the chief points are to stop haranguing people, to address their interests, and to put values up front. Often, it’s helpful to think about what makes for an effective face-to-face conversation. Instead of treating people as criminals , fools , or misfits , how about listening to their concerns , practicing a little modesty, and recognizing that everyone loves their children ? Narratives can play an important role, both as a way of finding out about the other person’s concerns and conveying the importance of vaccination.

Rep. Ilhan Omar says death threats have increased since Trump tweet.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/ilhan-omar-death-threats-trump-tweet-september-11.html,"Why Nancy Pelosi Is So Comfortable Dismissing the Influence of AOC and Her Fellow Lefties Rep. Ilhan Omar, the freshman lawmaker who has been under attack by President Trump based on a speech she made last month about Islamophobia in the wake of Sept. 11, said in a statement Sunday night that she has faced a number of death threats after Trump tweeted a video vilifying her. “Since the President’s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life―many directly referencing or replying to the President’s video,” she said in the statement . “I thank the Capitol Police, the FBI, the House Sergeant at Arms, and the Speaker of the House for their attention to these threats.” The video Trump tweeted cited a speech Omar made to the Council on American Islamic Relations on March 23. “For far too long, we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I’m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,” Omar said in the speech. “CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.” On April 9, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (who at one point was an administrator for a Facebook group that called Islam a “cancer”) tweeted out a clip of her comments condemning her description of the terror attacks as “some people who did something.” The next day, Fox & Friends played that line from the speech, and host Brian Kilmeade wondered aloud if “she’s an American first .” The day after that, the New York Post published a photo from the attacks on its cover , causing a coalition of Yemeni-American bodega owners to announce a boycott of the Post, accusing the tabloid of taking Omar’s words out of context in an effort to “provoke hatred and fear.” And on Friday, Trump tweeted out the offensive video, which spliced images of the burning Twin Towers with Omar’s comments. “We will never forget!” Trump wrote in the tweet. Many Democrats immediately responded with outrage and accused the president of attempting to foment hate and bigotry among his supporters through attacks on the first congresswoman to wear a hijab in office. Others pointed out the irony of the attacks from a president not known for his empathetic behavior in response to the Sept. 11 terror attacks: Trump himself went on a radio show on the day of the attacks and bragged that he now had the tallest building in downtown Manhattan. He also continued to use the tragedy to support Islamophobic conspiracy theories. During his campaign, he falsely claimed he saw “thousands and thousands” of Muslims in Jersey City cheering and celebrating as the World Trade Center collapsed in the attack—a lie he stood by repeatedly . On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she had spoken with officers in charge of security on Capitol Hill to ensure Omar’s safety. “They will continue to monitor and address the threats she faces,” Pelosi said in a statement . She also called for Trump to remove the tweet. “The President’s words weigh a ton, and his hateful and inflammatory rhetoric creates real danger ,” she said. Earlier in the month, a 55-year-old New York man was charged with threatening to kill Omar by “put[ting] a bullet in her…skull.” In response to the criticism, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Sunday defended Trump’s tweet by attempting to redirect the conversation to another conservative attack on Omar: her supposedly anti-Semitic comments . “Certainly the President is wishing no ill will and certainly not violence towards anyone,” Sanders said on ABC’s This Week . “But the President is absolutely and should be calling out the congresswoman for her not only one time but history of anti-Semitic comments.” While the president himself didn’t fully address the pushback, he did attack Pelosi for defending Omar: Before Nancy, who has lost all control of Congress and is getting nothing done, decides to defend her leader, Rep. Omar, she should look at the anti-Semitic, anti-Israel and ungrateful U.S. HATE statements Omar has made. She is out of control, except for her control of Nancy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019 Omar, who in her statement Sunday night also charged that the president’s rhetoric encouraged hateful white nationalists and other right-wing extremists and led to an increase in hate crimes, defended herself on Twitter after Trump’s attack and reiterated her reasons for running for office. “No one person—no matter how corrupt, inept, or vicious—can threaten my unwavering love for America,” she wrote on Twitter. “I stand undeterred to continue fighting for equal opportunity in our pursuit of happiness for all Americans.”"
Reading the redacted Mueller Report: seven things to look for.,slate.com,Richard L. Hasen,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-release-redacted-preview.html,"What Ilhan Omar’s Speech Really Meant Attorney General William Barr has indicated that a redacted version of the Mueller report is likely to be sent to Congress this week and made public. It could come any day now, though a Good Friday release, coinciding with the beginning of Passover, would be the news dump to end all news dumps. ( Update, April 15, 2019, at 12:10 p.m.: On Monday, the Department of Justice announced that it expected to release the report on Thursday morning.) Whenever the report comes, how will we know what to look for? From Barr’s summary released a few weeks ago, we expect the report to focus on both the question of possible “collusion” between Russian agents and Americans as well as whether the president obstructed justice in seeking to prevent a full and fair investigation of possible collusion. Passover begins with asking four questions, and in that spirit, I begin with four questions about possible collusion that I have been anticipating since the Barr summary that I hope we will be able to answer once we get to dig into the report itself. On collusion: 1. To what extent did Americans assist or cooperate with Russians or other foreign agents in hacking Democratic National Committee emails, in trying to break into American voter registration databases, or in efforts to spread “dirt” on President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential election opponent, Hillary Clinton? We know from earlier government reports that Russian agents did all three of these things, but we do not know whether any Americans were involved or might have known at the time of the interference. Barr’s summary of Robert Mueller’s report, meanwhile, stated that Mueller’s investigation “did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” Did members—or affiliates—of the campaign, though, coordinate with any Russian cutouts, such as Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks? 2. Were any of the people involved in this collusion investigation somehow connected to the Trump campaign or the Trump family? Alternatively, to what extent were campaign or family members duped by foreign agents? The Barr summary is very careful to say that there was no finding in Mueller’s report of “coordination,” which it defined in a particular legal way as an “agreement—tacit or express—between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference.” As Ben Steinberg suggests , there’s plenty of room for cooperation short of this legal standard that could be described in the report. For example, Mueller might believe that winks and nods suggested both sides were cooperating but doing so in a subtle enough way to prevent prosecutors from proving an illegal conspiracy. 3. How successful were the hacks into American voter registration databases and other election-connected computers? We have seen conflicting reports of the extent of Russian success in these endeavors, but the details have not been confirmed in an official government report. More importantly, what can be done to prevent such hacking efforts again? 4. If Americans cooperated with Russians in procuring or spreading opposition research, why did Mueller not charge any Americans with any crime in this area? As I explained in an earlier Slate piece , we must learn why Mueller declined to prosecute former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort or Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. for apparently violating laws prohibiting the solicitation of foreign contributions to American campaigns, based on those campaign surrogates’ June 2016 meeting with Russian agents at Trump Tower. As I wrote, “How Mueller answered this question could have profound ramifications for what federal law enforcement will do to stop foreign involvement in the upcoming 2020 elections.” Does Mueller point to new specific evidence Congress might consider in pursuing possible impeachment charges against Trump based upon obstruction? I have two additional—and similarly important—questions on how Mueller judged the issue of potential presidential obstruction of justice: 1. Does Mueller’s report use any language suggesting that a reasonable prosecutor acting in her discretion could have charged Trump with obstruction but for Department of Justice policy against indicting a sitting president? We know Mueller refused to make the call on whether Trump obstructed justice, but we do not know why he made that decision and whether it had to do with the strength of the evidence. All we know is that Mueller’s report says, “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him” and Barr took the subsequent step of exonerating his boss. 2. Does Mueller point to new specific evidence Congress might consider in pursuing possible impeachment charges against Trump based upon obstruction? If Mueller left the issue for Congress, does he do so laying out clear not previously public evidence for possible impeachment, or is there not much more than a judgment call about whether Trump’s publicly known actions rise to the level of impeachable offenses? Finally, there is a remaining question that encompasses the entire probe and how it was ultimately dealt with: To what extent does it look like Barr is trying to protect Trump and Trump’s family, such as Donald Trump Jr.? Despite his expected redactions, has Barr made it possible to evaluate Mueller’s reasoning or the evidence collected? This is a key question. Already Barr has given Trump a great gift by releasing a summary that has allowed Trump to claim his “exoneration” for weeks without anyone being able to raise a counterargument based on the actual evidence collected and analyzed by Mueller. We all are waiting to see if the redaction leaves a credible report, or more reason to be suspicious of Barr and a longer list of questions. We should at least know the answer to this question in a matter of days. Support our journalism

"John Oliver revisits the opioid crisis and casts Bryan Cranston, Michael Keaton as Richard Sackler (VIDEO).",slate.com,Marissa Martinelli,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/john-oliver-opioids-richard-sackler-keaton-cranston-williams.html,"John Oliver Explains Those Irritating Robocalls From Similar Phone Numbers When they eventually make a movie about the Sackler family, casting directors will have four very different options to choose from to play Richard Sackler, thanks to Last Week Tonight . John Oliver revisited the opioid crisis on Sunday, and while he criticized Cardinal Health, McKesson, and AmerisourceBergen, he reserved his most vehement criticism for Purdue Pharma. First, though, Oliver dismissed the idea that pharmaceutical companies can be trusted to regulate themselves when it comes to addictive painkillers. “If the bears in your zoo get out at night and start mauling the other animals, you don’t deputize one of the bears to monitor the situation,” he said. “I know what you’re thinking: But John, I’ve already bought him a little sheriff’s outfit to wear, and I think he’d look great in it . Of course he would, but at the end of the day, bears are gonna bear.” To dramatize how Sackler has responded to opioid addiction, Oliver recruited Michael Keaton, Bryan Cranston, Michael K. Williams, and Richard Kind to read extracts from Sackler’s emails and depositions . Hey, as long as Sackler insists on keeping video of his testimony sealed, you can’t prove he wasn’t sloppily eating a turkey sandwich at the time.

Trump signs executive order extending U.S. military commitment in Somalia.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-somalia-executive-order-military-national-emergency.html,"What Ilhan Omar’s Speech Really Meant Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: The U.S. is committing itself to a long-term stabilization mission in a chronically unstable country. The mission involves training and equipping the local government forces to fight against jihadi insurgents and won’t end until those local forces are capable of fighting on their own. Unfortunately, recruitment is low and the training is slow going, in part because the local U.S.-backed government is weak and commands little public support. Under the pretext of fighting international terrorism, the U.S. is taking on a group that poses little direct threat to the United States, is being drawn into local conflicts unrelated to its ostensible mission, and risks creating more radicalization through civilian casualties. It could be Iraq or Afghanistan (or substitute c ommunist for jihadi and it could be any number of Cold War proxy conflicts), but in this case it’s Somalia. Last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order extending a 2010 declaration of national emergency related to the conflict in Somalia, reiterating that the U.S. remains “strongly committed to Somalia’s stabilization” and that the “situation with respect to Somalia continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.” As I wrote in March , the U.S. military mission in Somalia has expanded dramatically since Trump took office and declared the Horn of Africa nation an “area of active hostilities.” This has included a sharp uptick in drone strikes and special forces raids against the militant group al-Shabaab. Until recently, the Pentagon had claimed, remarkably, that no civilians had been killed in these strikes. On April 5, shortly after the release of an Amnesty International report that investigated five of the dozens of strikes and found evidence of 14 civilian deaths, the military finally acknowledged having caused just two . There have also been reports that Somali officials have used the threat of al-Shabaab —which is nominally affiliated with al-Qaida—to draw U.S. firepower into local conflicts over land and clan rivalries. The U.S. currently has about 500 to 600 military personnel in Somalia, and they may be there for a while. As CNN reports , the U.S. mission “hinges on US Special Operations Forces being able to train an elite Somali army unit capable of defeating al Qaeda-linked militants on the ground.” The hope is that this group, known as Danab, will one day be an elite fighting force of about 3,000 troops capable of operating throughout the country, but right now it’s only about 500. One Pentagon official told CNN that it may take “approximately seven years for the Somalis to absorb all of these forces.” Nearly two decades into the war on terror, critics of U.S. military intervention are accustomed to treating missions like this with skepticism. But in this case, the bigger question is, why isn’t the president more skeptical? Since taking office, Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to reduce U.S. military commitments overseas and a frustration over what he sees as U.S. troops being asked to fight other countries’ wars for them. One wonders whether he even realizes he’s committing U.S. troops to a seven-year mission to prop up the government of Somalia at a time when the country’s own neighbors are desperate to pull their troops out of the conflict . (And extending an Obama administration executive order on top of that!) There’s an inherent contradiction in Trump’s worldview between his isolationist instincts and his commitment to standing out of the military’s way and letting the generals do what they think necessary—unlike the Obama administration’s approach, which he believes was burdensome and legalistic. Left to its own devices, the Pentagon tends to want more troops, more resources, and expanded missions. This dynamic was on view recently in Syria. After declaring victory over ISIS, Trump ordered a full withdrawal of U.S. troops in December. Trump’s advisers and congressional allies eventually talked him down to leaving a peacekeeping force of 200 or even 1,000 troops in the country to protect U.S. allies on the ground and prevent ISIS’s return. This will probably remain the status quo until the next time Trump gets frustrated and tweets about it The fight against al-Shabaab in Somalia has gotten far less attention from media and lawmakers than the fight against ISIS in Syria, and perhaps consequently, Trump appears to have taken little notice of it. And so, the war continues to expand with vague goals, no clear path to victory, and little to no pushback in Washington. "

Notre Dame fire: Authorities blame renovations for massive blaze.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/notre-dame-fire.html,"What Happened While We Were Waiting for the Mueller Report The fire at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris continued to burn into the night Monday, but after a day of fighting the blaze, the smoke began to thin, offering hope that parts of the iconic Gothic structure could be salvaged. The city fire chief announced that the main structure of the church—the two landmark rectangular towers—have been saved, but that two-thirds of the roof along with the spire had been destroyed. The preliminary assessments of the cause of the fire continue to point towards this being an accident associated with renovations being made to the structure. There have been reports of some artifacts, including the Crown of Thorns and the Tunic of St Louis, being recovered from the blaze, but the fate of numerous priceless pieces remains unclear. Smoke rises around the alter in front of the cross inside the Notre Dame Cathedral as a fire continues to burn in Paris, France, April 16, 2019. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/Pool In a speech outside the stricken cathedral Monday evening, French President Emmanuel Macron said “the worst has been avoided.” Macron also pledged to rebuild Notre Dame. “Notre Dame is our history, our imagination, where we’ve lived all our great moments, and is the epicentre of our lives,” Macron said. “It’s the story of our books, our paintings. It’s the cathedral for all French people, even if they have never been.
