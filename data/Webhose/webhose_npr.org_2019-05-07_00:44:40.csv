Swiss Government To End Emergency Reserves Of Coffee : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606967/swiss-government-to-end-emergency-reserves-of-coffee,"Swiss Government To End Emergency Reserves Of Coffee Swiss Government To End Emergency Reserves Of Coffee Embed Embed Heard on Morning Edition
For decades, government officials in Switzerland stockpiled essential staples such as sugar, rice and coffee. The government now says coffee ""is not essential for life.""
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Good morning, I'm Rachel Martin. Time for a little spring cleaning - Switzerland may be taking it a little far. The country announced plans this week to take coffee out of its national pantry. For decades, it's had a national emergency stockpile of essential staples - sugar, rice and coffee, for example. The Swiss consume twice as much as the average American. Now, in a move that defies historic Swiss neutrality, the government says - and I quote - ""coffee is not essential for life."" We, the staff of MORNING EDITION, respectfully disagree.

Beyond Crabgrass: A Look At America's 'Radical Suburbs',www.npr.org,Etelka Lehoczky,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/711902957/beyond-crabgrass-a-look-at-americas-radical-suburbs,"Radical Suburbs Experimental Living on the Fringes of the American City

Paperback, 174 Radical Suburbs Subtitle Experimental Living on the Fringes of the American City Author Amanda Kolson Hurley Think you know the suburbs? Well, it might be time to revisit.
At least, that's what Amanda Kolson Hurley, a senior editor at urban news site CityLab, wants you to do. Kolson Hurley is well-acquainted with suburbia's numerous negative stereotypes — some of them, such as racial segregation and ecological threat, all too valid. But in Radical Suburbs: Experimental Living on the Fringes of the American City , Kolson Hurley sets out to reveal a different side of the vast patchwork of not-quite-urban, not-quite-rural zones in which more than half of Americans live.
Writing with brisk, upbeat directness, Kolson Hurley urges the reader to envision a very different kind of suburb: one that's a mix of ethnic groups and income levels, where you can buy or rent a starter home for a reasonable price. One where you can walk or take public transit to most of the places you need to go. One with a flourishing sense of community, where you participate in your neighborhood association and know the people on your street.
She makes a great case that such a vision is vitally necessary. ""Rising social inequality and demographic shifts — and above all climate change — make it imperative to rethink who and what our suburbs are for,"" she writes. With unapologetic idealism, she looks forward buoyantly to the results of that rethinking, anticipating changes such as creative tax breaks to encourage diversity, improved enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, and an increase in co-housing and other unorthodox — but equitable and eco-friendly — living arrangements. When she knowledgeably describes workable solutions, her enthusiasm is contagious. ""Simple design changes to connect [suburban apartment] developments to nearby commercial areas [have] made residents more than 60 percent more likely to walk rather than drive there,"" she notes. ""Rather than slavishly pursuing new construction ... forward-thinking suburbs could redevelop ... 'grayfields' instead: dead malls, aging strip malls and high-vacancy office parks.""
Kolson Hurley's visions are compelling, but it's less clear whether they're actually achievable. By way of proof, she shows that diverse, sustainable suburbs have been built before. Combing through the history of housing development all over the U.S., she's found a handful of places where political fervor, artistic audacity, social idealism or a combination of the three have fostered vibrantly unique suburban communities. Today, few of those communities still fulfill their original ideals. Even so, their illustrations of what's possible are inspiring, leading the reader to overlook (at least for a while) the implications of their decline.
In Trevose, Pa., there's Concord Park, built by socialists and Quakers in 1954 to challenge housing segregation. Its mix of black and white families — as well as several interracial ones — gave the country a model integrated community at a time when such a thing seemed utterly unimaginable. In Lexington, Mass., there's Five Fields, designed in the early 1950s by proteges of Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius. Its layout harmonizes with existing natural features and promotes neighborly bonding by providing ample common land. And there's Stelton, N.J., founded by anarchists in 1915. In its heyday, collective matters were decided by vote — children included — husbands and wives weren't always legally married and the locals ""sometimes refuse[d] to stand for the national anthem at the movie theater in New Brunswick.""
There's also Economy, Pa., Greenbelt, Md. and Reston, Va. — all places where high ideals were allowed to triumph, however fleetingly, producing ways of life that residents would remember as uniquely stimulating, communal and humane. ""Humane"" is Kolson Hurley's word, an inspired adjective to evoke a sense of what, ultimately, we really need our living spaces to be. Her stories demonstrate what the unfettered human spirit can achieve when it's at its best.
But the overall history of housing in America isn't about the unfettered human spirit at its best; it's about greed and fear and short-sightedness. Those forces have had their way with the little communities Kolson Hurley chronicles. Some have all but vanished, while others have evolved beyond recognition. Meanwhile, she admits, the vast majority of America's suburbs are as inhumane as ever.
But that makes this little book all the more necessary. The communities Kolson Hurley chronicles are welcome reminders that any place, even a suburb, can be radical if you approach it the right way.

The next phase of the heist was caught on camera. The museum's surveillance system recorded the two men working together to carry away the tusk, which The Associated Press reported was five-and-a-half feet long.
Before the perpetrators were charged, the museum's spokesperson Maureen Clark told Alaska Public Media the 100-pound tusk was on display in a classroom at the center.
""People could come up and touch it,"" Clark told Alaska Public Media .
Not anymore.
After stealing the tusk, Elze and Boyd cut it up and sold off the pieces.
In court documents, federal prosecutors put the tusk's worth at somewhere between about $7,000 and $9,000 when it was still intact. But the cost to science is harder to measure.
An indictment issued when the men were charged last year called the tusk a paleontological resource: ""[It] was preserved in or on the earth's crust, and was of paleontological interest and provided information about the history of life on earth.""
Clark told Alaska Public Media the fossil was found during the 1980s on BLM land in the Colville River area up on the North Slope. The woolly mammoth became Alaska's official state fossil in 1986.
According to the National Park Service , mammoths lived during the Pleistocene ice-age, and their remains can be found throughout Russia and Alaska."

""We're driving at rush hour and my sweet guy is screaming and grabbing me and we're just scared to death,"" Walker's mom, Ellen Hughes, now 69, said in a StoryCorps interview recorded in February. ""This is not the guy I know at all.""

""When he was a little boy, an officer got on his back while he was screaming. And he's been handcuffed to gurneys in emergency rooms just for having a seizure and being big,"" she said. Walker is 6-foot-3.
To make matters worse, on this particular visit, Walker bit Ellen. ""I'm sitting there brokenhearted, scared out of my mind, bleeding, and Walker's trying to run away,"" she said. ""And I see, like, five guys on him, and all I think is 'This will not end well. They're gonna kill him.' ""

As Ellen tells it, every time Walker tried to escape at the hospital, Keith would say: ""Walker gets up! Walker sits down! Walker scoots back! Walker lies down!"" And then you said high-fives all around."" And to Ellen's surprise, Walker beamed and high-fived every officer.
Then Keith started singing the opening theme song to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood . At that point, Walker, who had been terrified moments before, felt like the officers were his friends, Ellen said. And people around them watched the joy unfold and wanted to join in.

Suspect Arrested In Louisiana Black Church Arson Cases,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606960/suspect-arrested-in-louisiana-black-church-arson-cases?station=KXJZ_FM,"A suspect has been arrested after fires destroyed three historically black churches over 10 days in St. Landry Parish. Rachel Martin talks to Katie Gagliano, a reporter for The Acadiana Advocate .
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Three historically black churches in the state of Louisiana are gone. Fires burned them to the ground over the course of 10 days. And now a 21-year-old, a parish sheriff deputy's son, has been arrested and charged with arson. Louisiana's Governor John Bel Edwards spoke after the arrest.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JOHN BEL EDWARDS: I don't know what this young man's motive was. I don't know what was in his heart. But I can say it cannot be justified or rationalized. These were evil acts.
MARTIN: We've got Katie Gagliano with us. She's been reporting the story for the Acadiana Advocate.
Katie, first off, can you just tell us more about these congregations? Are they all close together geographically? Do they have a connection to one another besides being historically black congregations?
KATIE GAGLIANO: Yes. Aside from being historically black congregations, they also are located on rural highways. And that was a connecting factor in the case. They are in two neighboring towns. The churches are all within a couple miles - probably about 15 to 20 minutes of one another.
They play very central roles in their communities. All the congregants I spoke to said that their families have attended these churches for generations. Many of the older members have celebrated all of their religious rights in these churches, including christenings, baptisms, marriages. They're - they have a lot of sentimental and emotional value for these communities.
MARTIN: Yeah. So let's talk about the person who's suspected of being responsible for the fires. What do we know about this man who's been arrested?
GAGLIANO: We know from his online activity he has connections to the black metal movement. This is a subset genre of kind of rock, metal music that was connected to several church burnings by people who were part of the movement in Norway in the 1990s. There are some - certain subsets of the genre that are connected to neo-Nazi and white supremacist movements, though we don't have evidence yet that he was connected to any of those subsets.
MARTIN: I mean, it is hard to hear about church burnings in the South and not conjure up stories of the 1960s and the civil rights movement, when black churches were familiar targets for racist attacks. I mean, how are these congregations navigating all of this right now?
GAGLIANO: Well, obviously, you know, when they and when others have heard that these three churches were all historically black, that is something that people think about. You think of a possible bias motive. They're still trying to determine if that was a reason in these fires.
You know, but the church communities are trying to approach this with as much resilience as possible. The pastors have been talking a lot about keeping the focus on love. Especially because we're still trying to determine motive and cause, a lot of the pastors were saying that they didn't want to create fear in their communities more than there already is.
MARTIN: Right. We've actually got some tape of Reverend Gerald Toussaint, one of the pastors of the churches that was burned down. Let's listen.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
GERALD TOUSSAINT: A lot of people want to make it a hate thing. Well, we don't represent hate. We represent love.
MARTIN: Which is really the only way forward through something like this. Katie Gagliano with the Acadiana Advocate.
Katie, thank you so much for sharing your reporting on this. We appreciate it.
GAGLIANO: Thank you for having me.

Christine T. Nguyen /MPR News There may be few occupations considered more romantic than being a lighthouse keeper. Lee Radzak, who will retire Friday after 36 years at the iconic Split Rock Lighthouse on Lake Superior's North Shore, might argue there are few jobs that people misconceive more.
Split Rock's been drawing visitors since the 1920s, when Highway 61 opened. People marvel at the lighthouse standing sentinel on the 160-foot cliff looking out across the breathtaking expanse of Lake Superior.
Lee Radzak moved here in 1983.
""This was a perfect place,"" he said. ""My wife and I just got married a couple of months earlier and we were ripe for a change so it worked out great.""
For lighthouse lovers — and apparently there are a lot — Split Rock seems to evoke solitude, at least based on the questions Radzak has fielded again and again.
""If my wife and I are sitting on the front porch they say, 'do you live here?' Yes. 'Do you live here year round?' Yes. 'Oh, it must be lonely!' "" he said. ""And then you want to say, 'Look behind you. There's 50 people standing there listening to you talk, or climbing the steps to the lighthouse.' ""
Split Rock attracts 160,000 visitors every year, about 2,500 a day during the summer. There are far fewer in winter, but they still come, even when the temperature is below zero and the storms blow so hard the spray coats the buildings with ice.
While people often describe him as the lighthouse keeper, his formal title is historic site manager. Radzak trained as an archaeologist. Split Rock attracted him as an opportunity to focus on one historic site and develop it. There was a lot to learn, starting with the history.
[Lighthouses] represent man's humanity to man and ... that still resonates to people.
Lee Radzak, retiring lighthouse keeper
""As a lighthouse goes, it was kind of a Johnny Come Lately"" he said. ""It wasn't built until 1909.""
""I was fortunate enough that, back in the 1980s and '90s, that the sons and daughters of the original lighthouse keepers that served in the 1910s and '20s were then in their 80s and 90s, and I had a chance to meet and talk with a lot of those folks, the kids that grew up here back in the early days,"" he said.
In those pre-Highway 61 days there was more solitude.
""There were three families that lived here pretty much on their own, other than some boat traffic going up and down the shore,"" he said. ""And 5 miles to the closest town for their mail.""

Christine T. Nguyen /MPR News They lived in the three houses next to the lighthouse. A boat dropped them off in the spring and picked them up in the fall.
""Some of them had really good photographs,"" he said. ""We got the keepers' logs of what the keepers did every day during their time here. So it's a very well-documented site.""
The Minnesota Historical Society took over the lighthouse after the Coast Guard decommissioned it in 1969.
A 7-foot beam visible for 22 miles
At the top of the lighthouse is what Radzak calls Split Rock's crown jewel — a huge Fresnel lens made by French glassworkers.
""Usually the Coast Guard pulls all the working apparatus out of a lighthouse when it is retired,"" he said. ""But we were fortunate that they knew it would be protected by the state of Minnesota so they left it in place and we still have it here now.""
The keepers lit the lens with a kerosene lamp to warn ships away from the rocky shore. The 252 cut-glass prisms in the lens focused the light into a 7-foot beam visible for 22 miles. On days when they couldn't see, they sounded the foghorns. Using a gas-powered air compressor the horns could be heard 5 miles away.
Reportedly they were so loud up close they would knock people to their knees if they were foolish enough to walk in front of them.
Commemorating the SS Edmund Fitzgerald
It was Radzak who, in 1985, began the annual tradition of lighting the lantern on Nov. 10, the anniversary of the sinking of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald, a freighter that sank in Lake Superior in 1975 with the loss of its 29 crew members. It is the one time visitors can enter the lamp room while the light is lit. The staff holds a ceremony called the ""Muster of the Last Watch"" where they ring a ship's bell for every member of the crew lost on the Fitzgerald. There can be huge crowds; Radzak says people come from as far away as the East Coast and Texas.
He thinks lighthouses are popular because they exist on the edge — the edge of land and of water. ""And they represent man's humanity to man and trying to protect the people out on the water and that still resonates to people,"" he said.
""It's huge shoes to fill for sure, for everybody,"" says Karly Fransen, who will fill in as interim manager for the summer season.
Fransen and her family will live in the lighthouse keeper's house. Fransen says she's excited about the summer, but she's not sure if she'll apply for the full position.
""I'm not assuming that I would even be the one that they would choose,"" she said, ""but I'm the only one that gets to have a trial.""
The job will be posted in mid-August. Minnesota Historical Society manager Ben Leonard will lead the search for a replacement.
""Yeah, I think that this job will be probably the hardest job to fill in the historical society,"" he said. ""Because people think about the view, they don't think about the email or the reports or the HR issues, because they aren't romantic.""
Leonard says he's looking for a historian with the patience and skills to manage crowds, harsh weather, and deal with the occasional bear. But even without a formal posting the Historical Society is already getting inquiries about the job."
Big Ag Is Pushing Laws To Restrict Neighbors' Ability To Sue Farms,www.npr.org,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/04/12/712227537/big-ag-is-pushing-laws-to-restrict-neighbors-ability-to-sue-farms,"Enlarge this image Young hogs owned by pork industry giant Smithfield Foods gather around water at a farm in Farmville, N.C.

Gerry Broome/AP Images Every state has a ""right-to-farm"" law on the books to protect farmers from being sued by their neighbors for the routine smells and noise created by farming operations. But this year, the agriculture industry has been pushing in several states to amend those laws so that they will effectively prevent neighbors from suing farms at all — even massive industrial livestock operations.
The push is a response to the millions of dollars awarded so far to five groups of farm neighbors in North Carolina who sued a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods, the biggest pork company in the country, over air pollution -- including the manure particles and intense odors put out by large hog operations. The first of 26 lawsuits against the company, representing nearly 500 plaintiffs, was heard in 2017.
In the past several months, legislators in Utah, Nebraska, Georgia, North Carolina, West Virginia, and Oklahoma have proposed, and in some cases passed, legislation that they say will protect farmers against similar lawsuits. The legislation varies, but several proposals reduce the potential damages that plaintiffs could win in such a suit or limit the distance from the farm a neighbor must live in order to bring a suit. Some do both.
Critics say that these changes to existing right-to-farm laws aren't necessary to protect farmers. ""Our law is already extremely strong [in Georgia]. They're trying to find a solution to a problem that doesn't exist,"" says April Lipscomb, a staff attorney with the Atlanta office of the Southern Environmental Law Center. ""Nuisance lawsuits have not been prevalent in the state.""
The agriculture industry is framing these bills as a necessary response to the threat farmers face from nuisance lawsuits, such as those brought in North Carolina, where since last spring, juries in five cases have awarded plaintiffs in Duplin, Bladen, Pender, and Sampson counties more than $574 million in their lawsuits against pork company Murphy Brown, a subsidiary of Smithfield. The plaintiffs alleged that the company's mismanagement of hog waste degraded their quality of life and reduced their property values. (The plaintiffs' awards have been reduced to comply with a North Carolina law capping punitive damages.)
Farm lobby groups say they must fend off similar outcomes in other states. And state farm bureaus and industry lobby groups have been clear that the North Carolina lawsuits are the impetus behind the expanded right-to-farm proposals.
For instance, the Utah Farm Bureau wrote in a blog post that the state's right-to-farm law should be tightened given that ""in recent years, some have quickly turned to lawsuits to settle realities of production agriculture."" The Georgia Farm Bureau and the Nebraska Farm Bureau also wrote in support of the right-to-farm bills in those states and linked their proposals to the successful North Carolina lawsuits.
And in at least three states, right-to-farm expansions have already passed. West Virginia's governor signed that state's right-to-farm bill into law on March 27. The state senator who sponsored the legislation was clear that nuisance lawsuits ""in other states"" were what motivated him to bring the bill.
Oklahoma's governor signed that state's right-to-farm expansion into law on April 1. The bill's sponsor explicitly linked the bill to the North Carolina verdicts. Oklahomans defeated a ballot initiative to expand the state's right-to-farm law in 2016.
North Carolina also changed its law soon after the first cases against Smithfield went to a jury. In 2017 and 2018 , the legislature twice overrode the governor's veto to pass laws that capped the damages plaintiffs can receive from a nuisance suit and restricted the conditions in which a plaintiff can bring such a suit.
Those two laws fit the profile of right-to-farm bills that have been proposed in other states. In West Virginia, the new right-to-farm law restricts who can bring a nuisance suit to residents living within a half-mile of the farm — despite the fact that the effects of air and water pollution from large-scale farms are evident in a much wider radius. Utah's bill similarly restricts potential plaintiffs to a half-mile radius, while Georgia's bill limits them to a five-mile radius.
And some of the bills cap plaintiffs' potential damages as well. The West Virginia law prohibits punitive damages altogether, restricting damages to compensation for diminished property value. This change is yet another callback to the North Carolina verdicts: The major damages awarded to the plaintiffs in the North Carolina cases were punitive.
Restricting or eliminating punitive damages can make it more difficult for plaintiffs to bring nuisance lawsuits, given that damages awarded may not even cover their legal fees. In one North Carolina verdict , compensatory damages awarded to plaintiffs totaled less than $13,000 per plaintiff. Critics say that eliminating punitive damages is a particular concern in the case of farm nuisance lawsuits, given that those affected by the environmental fallout from large-scale animal farming are disproportionately low-income people of color.
The outcome of North Carolina's changes to its right-to-farm law will be to ""deprive affected neighbors of a meaningful legal recourse"" when faced with the odors and pollution associated with large-scale animal farming, says Will Hendrick, a staff attorney at the Waterkeeper Alliance who is based in North Carolina. The ability to bring nuisance lawsuits was ""a protection afforded under common law, it was a protection that predated our statehood, and it was a protection pursued effectively,"" Hendrick says. ""That same measure of justice will, as a result of this recent legislation, no longer be available to similarly situated North Carolinians.""
These right-to-farm expansions could also be difficult to challenge, says Robert Hensley, legal advocacy senior counsel at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). ""The remedy is probably in the legislature, which is the same place that's passing these laws,"" he says.
When asked why the industry is taking such an aggressive approach in so many states on right-to-farm this year, Kara Shannon, manager of farm animal welfare campaigns at the ASPCA, says that more rural communities are speaking out about the environmental and quality-of-life problems related to large-scale animal agriculture.
""Across the country, we're seeing more rural communities — the people who are actually living next to these CAFOs — really starting to organize,"" she says. In some cases, those communities are ""pass[ing] local ordinances and permitting and trying to get a handle on how this waste is being managed, or what the process looks like to build a new CAFO.""
Rural communities have had several high-profile victories against new industrial farms in recent years, including the efforts of several Kansas communities to stop construction of a Tyson poultry processing plant in the state. Nebraska residents have repeatedly challenged the introduction of large-scale poultry farming in that state that was brought about by Costco's new plant there.
Neighbors of large-scale animal farms, which can house tens of thousands of animals, often complain of odors so powerful they can't use their property, polluted well water, and asthma. The agriculture industry, meanwhile, has pushed for state and federal deregulation of air emissions from such farms. In some states , runoff from farm manure is subject to only limited oversight."

State Department Tried To Dissuade WikiLeaks From Posting U.S. Documents,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712631083/state-department-tried-to-dissuade-wikileaks-from-posting-u-s-documents,"State Department Tried To Dissuade WikiLeaks From Posting U.S. Documents State Department Tried To Dissuade WikiLeaks From Posting U.S. Documents Embed Embed Heard on Morning Edition
In 2010, WikiLeaks posted 250,000 leaked U.S. diplomatic cables. David Greene talks to Harold Koh, the then-legal adviser to the State Department who urged the organization not to publish them.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
All right. And let's go back in that timeline now to November 2010. The publication of 200,000 secret U.S. government documents was imminent. The then-legal adviser at the State Department sent a letter to Julian Assange and his attorney. It said, this release would harm lives, and it asked Assange to stop the publication. The author of that letter is Harold Koh. And he joins us on the phone this morning.
Mr. Koh, thanks for taking the time.
HAROLD KOH: Good to be here.
GREENE: So it sounds like the State Department was scrambling as WikiLeaks was ready to release all of these cables. Can you take me inside? What was happening?
KOH: Well, the cables - many of the cables indicate information that's threatening to human rights activists. You often have cables that say that an embassy official met with somebody in hiding - who is hiding from authorities, and this is what happened.
The request was made to Assange to redact this material so these lives could be protected. He and his colleagues were pretty much contemptuous of this and said, well, you know, let the chips fall where they may.
And so in the couple of days before the release, there was a mad scramble to try to get to all these people and move them. It was an extraordinary performance by dozens or maybe hundreds of State Department officials around the world.
Anyway, we know of nobody who got hurt as a result of the release. But when the release occurred, Assange said, see, no problem. In fact, he was the one who put them in jeopardy, and the State Department people were the ones who saved them.
GREENE: But as I understand it, didn't Assange actually reach out to you saying, give me the names of people who could really be hurt here? Why didn't you take him up on his offer to give him some names of people who were truly at risk?
KOH: I don't think that's actually what happened. The main point here was we quickly realized we were not negotiating with The New York Times or people who had high journalistic standards. And so as a result, we - there were some negotiations back and forth. And they were pretty high-handed about it, which is - we have no notion that there is any valid confidentiality interest in any of these documents. We're just going to dump them out there.
GREENE: But did Assange reach out? I mean, did you feel like there was an opening to talk to him about certain names and protect them?
KOH: There was pretty limited discussion. I think it was through his lawyers largely.
GREENE: I guess I just wonder, wasn't that an opportunity to find a balance? I mean, to protect lives but also protect press freedom, which is something that, you know, the State Department promotes so passionately in other countries.
KOH: I mean, we requested that. It was he who rejected it.
GREENE: And you didn't see an opening to explore it further - I mean, you had become convinced that Julian Assange and WikiLeaks - I mean, in your mind, was not legitimate as a media organization.
KOH: They weren't interested in negotiating. They were interested in revealing. And they were just going to say, we'll do it in the next hour, you know. We'll do it tomorrow if you don't - they weren't actually negotiating with us. And, you know, they'd received documents through some method of cyber intrusion, which we later learned more about.
So as soon as this release occurred, everybody had to go through every single cable that had been sent to see if there was anything there that we would have to then discuss with our foreign government allies so as to try to smooth over relations.
I mean, just imagine if all of your emails of the last year were suddenly put out onto the Web. You'd have to - at a time in which you have other work to do, you have to go back and look at all your old emails to see whether you've inadvertently insulted someone by saying something...
GREENE: Although to be fair, I mean, I don't work in government. Isn't it the point that people who are working on taxpayer money in government - I mean, that all the work you're doing on work emails is stuff that could at some point be made public and available?
KOH: Well, not classified emails. I mean, the classified emails are classified for a reason. And you generate information based on notions of confidentiality. I mean, if you're doing something under what you believe to be is a journalistic privilege, you tell somebody the name of sources that you wouldn't tell otherwise. And your hope and assumption was that it would be protected.
You know, like, I'm all for transparency. I favor transparency. But there are legitimate confidentiality interests that every organization has to respect or they can't do their job. And, you know, if you have somebody like The New York Times or The Washington Post who understands that idea and is ready to figure out a solution and discuss it, that's one thing. But Assange was in a very, very different place.
GREENE: Harold Koh was legal adviser to the State Department. He is now a professor at Yale University.
Thank you so much.

WikiLeaks was already established for posting secret documents from anonymous leakers before its disclosure of U.S. government and military information in 2010. We have a timeline of key disclosures.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
So Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is in British custody and facing charges in the United States. And we're going to look this morning at the timeline that brought us here and also at some of the impact Assange has had on U.S. diplomacy and national security. I want to begin with NPR national security correspondent David Welna. Good morning, David.
DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: Good morning, David.
GREENE: So look back for me. When did the U.S. government actually begin to take notice of WikiLeaks?
WELNA: Well, I'm sure it noticed WikiLeaks 12 years ago, when WikiLeaks posted a U.S. Army manual of standard operating procedures for soldiers who were guarding hundreds of al-Qaida suspects in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But it was 2010 when WikiLeaks really got a lot of attention. That's when it posted a leaked U.S. military video that was shot from an Apache helicopter gunship, and it showed an air attack on more than a dozen people on the ground in Iraq who were clearly not fighting back. And among those killed were two men who worked for the Reuters News Agency.
And that same year, the military court-martialed an Army private - known then as Bradley Manning, who is now known as Chelsea Manning - who was charged with downloading to a personal computer that video and hundreds of thousands more military and diplomatic documents.
GREENE: Well, wasn't that also around the same time that Assange himself was accused of sexual assault and rape in Sweden? And did those accusations slow down the operations at WikiLeaks at all?
WELNA: Yeah, Assange was questioned by police in Stockholm about these sexual assault allegations, which he denied. But that's when the somewhat shining image of Assange in the eyes of some really started to tarnish. And yet, while all that was unfolding, WikiLeaks continued posting hundreds of thousands of previously secret military documents about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
GREENE: And then, of course, we come to 2016 and WikiLeaks, you know, being part of the story of the 2016 presidential election.
WELNA: Right. It was, and WikiLeaks posted some 20,000 emails from leaders of the Democratic National Committee in July of 2016, right around the time of the conventions. And that was a development that Donald Trump, who was then the Republican presidential nominee, cheered.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DONALD TRUMP: WikiLeaks - I love WikiLeaks.
WELNA: And Assange, shortly after that, denied to you, on our air, that Russia was the source of those leaked emails. And then WikiLeaks, a few months later, dumped more documents right before the election from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager. And that's something that she thinks may have contributed to her loss to Trump.
GREENE: All right, a reminder of the timeline here and WikiLeaks and some of the impact. That's NPR national security correspondent David Welna.
David, thank you so much.
WELNA: You're quite welcome, David. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Boeing says it's close to finishing a software update for its troubled 737 Max aircraft. This comes as the company is trying to win back public and government support of the grounded fleet.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Here in Washington today the Federal Aviation Administration is going to meet with airlines and pilots to talk about the troubled Boeing 737 Max airplanes. The planes are still grounded worldwide after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed almost 350 people. As NPR's Russell Lewis reports, these talks come as Boeing says it's close to finishing a software update that may allow the jets to start flying again.
RUSSELL LEWIS, BYLINE: When the 737 Max entered service in 2017, it had a new safety feature. The plane would sense if it was close to entering an aerodynamic stall and force the jet's nose down. But it would do it without any commands from the pilots. That software, called MCAS, played a part in the two accidents. Dennis Tajer flies the 737 for American Airlines and is a spokesman of the Allied Pilots Association.
DENNIS TAJER: We believed it was manageable, but you had to know what was going on. But we're learning more, since the Ethiopian crash, about just how aggressive this system was.
LEWIS: Pilots of both doomed airplanes struggled to pull up before crashing. In a simulated flight of a different version of the 737, a crew demonstrates how difficult it is to control an aircraft when it wants to fly pitched down.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: We're at 300 knots now, fighting. And I am struggling to keep this aircraft flying.
LEWIS: The pilots in this simulation wrestled the plane for several minutes before they eventually gained control. Boeing says it has reprogrammed software on the 737 Max to prevent it from using erroneous data to trigger the MCAS anti-stall system. Here's CEO Dennis Muilenberg speaking yesterday.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DENNIS MUILENBURG: We're taking a comprehensive, disciplined approach and taking the time to make sure that we get it right.
LEWIS: Muilenberg says the company's test pilots have flown 96 flights with this updated software, and more are scheduled in the next few weeks.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MUILENBURG: Yet we know we can always be better. And these recent accidents have intensified our commitment to continuous improvement as we design, build and support the safest airplanes in the sky.
LEWIS: That may be a long process. Neera Jain teaches mechanical engineering at Purdue University. She's not involved with the software redesign. But says Boeing's challenge is it needs to re-engineer its systems so pilots can have confidence and trust in the plane's automation.
NEERA JAIN: We have to do a better and better job of then figuring out how to design those systems in a new way so that they don't just technically do the correct things but that they are also, for lack of a better word, then being transparent to the human. And that's a piece that I think - this is certainly a strong signal that there's a lot more that we have to do.
LEWIS: The FAA's meeting today is with executives and pilots of the three U.S. airlines that fly the 737 Max - Southwest, United and American. The agency says it wants to hear their concerns before it decides when to return the Max to service.

South Korean Court Strikes Down Decades-Old Abortion Ban : NPR,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712281726/south-korean-court-strikes-down-decades-old-abortion-ban,"Enlarge this image Protesters celebrate after listening to a judgment during a rally demanding the abolition of South Korea's abortion law outside of the Constitutional Court in Seoul on Thursday. Lee Jin-man/AP Lee Jin-man/AP Protesters celebrate after listening to a judgment during a rally demanding the abolition of South Korea's abortion law outside of the Constitutional Court in Seoul on Thursday.
Lee Jin-man/AP A euphoric smile spread across the face of an activist, who goes by the name Jisoo, as she announced in a trembling voice, ""It's ruled unconstitutional!""
South Korea's Constitutional Court on Thursday struck down the country's laws prohibiting abortion, a landmark decision challenging the 66-year-old ban that had become increasingly unpopular in recent years.
After the announcement of the ruling, an uproarious cheer and cries of relief broke out from a couple hundred protesters outside the courthouse. A coalition of women's rights activists, legal and medical experts and feminist scholars declared victory, after years of campaigning for the laws' repeal.
Hundreds of others protesters, many from Christian evangelical groups, opposed ending the ban.
South Korea, where Catholics and Protestants outnumber Buddhists , is one of several countries in Asia that either ban abortion outright or limit it — including the heavily Catholic Philippines, predominantly Buddhist Laos and Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
Under Articles 269 and 270 of South Korea's Criminal Act, women who intentionally end pregnancy are punishable with up to a year in prison, and doctors who perform abortion can face up to two years in jail. Only a few exceptions are allowed, such as pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, serious threat to a mother's health, or the expectation that a child will be born with severe deformity.
The Constitutional Court's ruling on Thursday said those laws infringe on the basic rights of pregnant women by essentially forcing pregnancy and childbirth. The decision requires South Korea's legislature to change the law by the end of next year.
Enacted in 1953, the abortion ban went largely unenforced. Abortion was widespread and condoned for decades under government-led ""family planning"" schemes. As recently as 2017, according to the estimate of the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, nearly 50,000 abortions were performed, but only 62 incidents among them led to indictment, and 13 to punishment, according to the prosecutor's office.
Nonetheless, South Korea has been reluctant to reverse or scale back the ban. When a midwife charged with performing an illegal abortion filed an appeal in 2012, the Constitutional Court's 4:4 decision allowed it to stand. Two thirds of the judges are needed to effect a change.
In Thursday's ruling of the nine-judge panel, just two justices endorsed the constitutionality of the law. While recognizing the government's responsibility to protect the right to life of a fetus, the majority said the anti-abortion law ""excessively limits [a] pregnant woman's right to self-determination"" and ""violates the principle of balance by awarding unilateral and absolute superiority to protection of [a] fetus's life.""
The opinion of the South Korea public on abortion has also shifted substantially as the country has gained economic clout. A recent Gallup Korea poll showed that 45 percent of respondents consider abortion murder, compared to 78 percent in 1994. Another poll by Realmeter, a public opinions research company, found in 2017 that 51.9 percent of South Koreans support abolishing the law, up from just 33.6 percent in 2010.
Many activists on both sides outside the Constitutional Court on Thursday acknowledged that the court's ruling opens another chapter of the long fight, as the National Assembly works out the details of legislative and systematic changes.
But even if the assembly doesn't make changes to the current law, it will be automatically nullified in 2021, the court's ruling dictates."

toggle caption Malte Mueller/Getty Images/fStop Talking about controversial topics with your political opposite can feel like an exercise in futility. One tip, experts say, is to establish common ground as quickly as you can.
Malte Mueller/Getty Images/fStop In a deeply divided America, a casual political debate can easily spiral into a shouting match — even if both parties set out to keep things civil. So how can we talk about thorny issues with people who fundamentally disagree with us?
Over the past two months, NPR has been traveling the country for our series Civility Wars to see how Americans are grappling with the idea of civility in polarizing times. During that time, we heard from the new mayor of Charlottesville, Va., on why she's wary of the very idea of civility; we reported on a gathering of political opposites trying to bridge the political divide ; and we talked to two Twitter trolls who admit that their online feuds might be friendlier if they could just meet in person. Often, we heard the same thing: Talking across difference is hard.
As part of the series, we also reached out to four people who've spent a lot of time thinking about how to have more respectful political conversations. Here's what they told us.
Starting the conversation The first tip from our experts is to carefully choose the moment to talk. You can't force someone into a conversation about a contentious topic, says the Rev. Jennifer Bailey, the founder and executive director of Faith Matters Network, an organization that trains leaders and activists on how to create connected communities. Rather than ""demanding a conversation,"" Bailey recommends ""extending an invitation.""
It's also important to avoid making snap judgments about people or writing them off based on their own background or your own assumptions. Bailey encourages people to ""be brave"" and assume others have good intentions.
Another tip is to stay humble, says Karin Tamerius, a former psychiatrist and founder of Smart Politics, a nonprofit that teaches progressives activists how to communicate more effectively with people across the political spectrum. ""While you may be well educated on a topic, you don't necessarily have all the answers.""
Lastly, avoid approaching your conversation from a zero-sum standpoint, says Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, and author of Love Your Enemies: How Decent People Can Save America From the Culture of Contempt . As Brooks suggests, don't view the conversation as an ""I win, you lose"" debate. Rather, consider it an opportunity to understand the other person and the reasons behind that person's position, adds Bailey.
Once you're talking Establish common ground as quickly as you can, our experts advise. ""It's usually around things like values and goals and emotion"" that we can find commonalities, says Tamerius. You can also discuss things you both love, like family or the outdoors. This will build trust and allow you to start connecting.
The experts also agree that asking questions is the most important part of the conversation. Tamerius recommends using open-ended and nonjudgmental questions.
For example, instead of saying, ""How can you possibly overlook all the evidence on climate change?"" you might ask, ""What experiences have shaped your thinking on this issue?""
Also, don't let unwittingly offensive remarks short-circuit the conversation.
""Don't dismiss people just because they use a word or two that seems insensitive to you,"" says Liz Joyner, the founder and CEO of the Village Square, a nonpartisan public educational forum.
""You need to be understanding of the intention behind the word,"" says Joyner. Consider who's speaking and their life experience. ""Give people the space to explain themselves.""
Don't attack someone's personal beliefs either, because as Tamerius explains, we have strong emotional attachments to them.
""We're wired to defend them,"" Tamerius says. ""Our nervous systems treat attacks on our political beliefs the same way they respond to challenges to our physical safety. So if someone attacks my partisan attachments, I'm going to respond pretty much the same [way] I would respond if I were being attacked by a lion.""
When it's your turn to speak, it helps to explain how the issue affects you on a personal level. ""Facts and figures rarely persuade,"" says Joyner. Instead, she recommends ""appealing to [others'] better angels rather than their inner statistician.""
If things aren't going well, our experts all caution against pushing the conversation too far. Tamerius says you should monitor the emotional response of your partner as well as your own to avoid a full-blown fight.
""Be prepared to remove [yourselves] from the conversation before [you] reach a point where you're fully triggered,"" she says. If the conversation is getting heated, try pausing things, and don't return to it until you are both ready.
And if neither of you has changed your views by the end of the conversation, that's fine, says Joyner. Remember, she says, ""your goal isn't to agree; it's to disagree and keep talking."""

""I'm supposed to be a dead man,"" says Bobi Wine, a Ugandan musician turned politician.
His driver Yasin Kawuma was shot dead on Aug. 13. Wine tweeted a graphic picture he said was of the man's dead body. Wine says police were the ones who shot Kawuma, but Wine says he was their real target.
Bobi Wine's real name is Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu. He rose to fame as a musician — first with love songs and dance songs, but more recently turned to political themes in his music. His 2017 song ""Freedom"" has become a rallying cry for the country's opposition.
In the same year, Wine was elected to the country's Parliament as an independent.
He's become a leader in opposing the country's longtime President Yoweri Museveni — in power since 1986. Museveni is known for violently crushing dissent. Human Rights Watch says the government ""continues to violate free association, expression, and assembly rights.""
""We are living in a country where life does not mean a thing,"" Wine tells NPR's Scott Simon.
Wine came into NPR's offices in Washington, D.C. this week. He was walking with a crutch. ""I'm feeling pain in my back, in my shoulders, in various parts of my body. But my spirit is high and I don't think about pain anymore,"" he says. Femi Kuti, Brian Eno And 86 Others Sign Letter Supporting Ugandan Opposition Leader
He was arrested in mid-August after clashes between opposition supporters and supporters of Uganda's ruling party. Security forces accused Wine of fomenting the violence and arrested him. Wine was later released and promptly rearrested and charged with treason, along with 33 others, according to Amnesty International.
Wine says security forces beat him severely and tortured him. He wrote on Facebook that soldiers broke down the door of a hotel room where he had holed up and beat him with an iron bar, then dragged him into a vehicle and continued to beat him.
Wine tells NPR it was the soldiers of the Special Forces Command, a group that guards the president, who ""kicked me, beat me everywhere and did despicable things to me. They squeezed my testicles, they hit me with gun butts, when I screamed they rapped my head again and hit me so hard on the back of the head until I was unconscious.""
Uganda's security minister, Gen. Elly Tumwine, told The Washington Post that Wine and others ""fought with the ones who arrested them, and that's what caused their ailments,"" adding that a ""medical examination found there wasn't much.""
Government spokesperson Ofwono Opondo P'Odel said in a statement that Wine ""is before courts of law in Uganda for treason and inciting violence, and no doubt, his lawyer[s] Bob Amsterdam and others are trying to get him off the hook by employing diversionary tactics in raising the tantalizing, although unproven, allegations of torture.""
President Museveni has called Wine's allegations of torture ""fake news.""
Wine was eventually allowed to leave the country. He came to the U.S. for medical treatment, and held a news conference this week to encourage halting U.S. military aid to Uganda.
He talked more about U.S. aid to Uganda and his plans to return to the country, despite the risks, with Simon on Weekend Edition. Interview Highlights
On asking the U.S. to halt military aid to Uganda
All of us want a peaceful region, and indeed the Ugandan army plays a role and the U.S. government plays a role funding the army. But it's important also for the U.S. to know, especially the U.S. taxpayer, that the money they give the Ugandan military is mainly used to torture Ugandans. I would note that the gun that was used to shoot my driver is an American gun.
On returning to Uganda
Yes, I'm going to go back to Uganda. I don't have another home. Uganda is my home; that is where I was born, and that is where I will be buried. ...
It's dangerous for me, but this is not just about me. There is this lady who just had a baby by C-section. She was beaten so hard that even by the time I left Uganda, she was still passing blood. There's another guy ... the doctors told us he will never be able to walk. There's another lady, I'm not sure if she's still alive.
So many people — hundreds if not thousands — go through this torture. So this cannot be about me. I'm only humbled and privileged to see that my brutalization attracted the eye of the world and I'm trying to use every little time that I still have alive to raise that voice. ...
I'm supposed to be a dead man. It was just a few seconds when I left that seat where I was sitting that my driver was shot. We are living in a country where life does not mean a thing.
I'm not sure whether this is not the last time I'm coming here or to any other country. So I've decided to dedicate every last bit of my life to raise that voice. ...
My children live in Uganda. They are Ugandans. And even when I could get them asylum, there are more than 40 million Ugandans. Eighty-five percent of them are younger than me. I am 36 years old. And we have a demographic of over 85 percent under the age of 35. So it cannot be about my life.
I've said this before and I'll say it again: We have to win back our freedom and dignity or we shall die trying.
On his current political goals
For now, we're sensitizing people to get confident. In the times of terror, we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. Many of our contemporaries are being killed every now and then. So in Uganda we live every day the way it comes. ...
Everybody's advising me not to go back. Everybody thinks it's dangerous to go back. But as one person I cannot leave 40 million people in danger. If my life is a sacrifice that has to be taken for the redemption of our country, so be it.

A Madonna cover this is not. ""We're on the borderline / Caught between the tides of pain and rapture,"" Parker sighs of a pairing in severely dire straits. The sound is almost bacchanalian, suited for luxury and extravagance — with a harpsichord, a reedy breakdown and the conga drums we last heard on ""Patience."" There's a little bit more familiar, psych-y weirdness here, with Parker's voice stretched out like taffy, wrapped around the song's sweet excesses.

Kim Tightens Leadership Over North Korea In Major Government Reshuffle : NPR,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712628100/kim-tightens-leadership-over-north-korea-in-major-government-reshuffle,"Enlarge this image North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un listens during a meeting in February with President Trump at the second U.S.-North Korea summit in Hanoi. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un listens during a meeting in February with President Trump at the second U.S.-North Korea summit in Hanoi.
Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Updated Saturday 9:02 p.m. ET
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signaled his impatience with the United States, saying he was willing to hold a third summit with President Donald Trump, but only if the U.S. comes up with mutually agreeable terms for a deal by the end of this year.
""We of course place importance on resolving problems through dialogue and negotiations,"" Kim told a session of parliament Friday, the Korean Central News Agency reported on Saturday. ""But U.S.-style dialogue of unilaterally pushing its demands doesn't fit us, and we have no interest in it,"" he added.
""Anyway, we will wait for a bold decision from the U.S. with patience till the end of this year,"" Kim continued, ""but I think it will definitely be difficult to get such a good opportunity as the previous summit."" That summit, in Vietnam in February, ended without an agreement.
Kim has repeatedly pledged to give up his nuclear weapons, but insists that it must be done one step at a time, with sanctions relief in exchange for each step. He has rejected the U.S. position that he must denuclearize all at once, before sanctions are lifted.
Pyongyang has also indicated that if the U.S. is unwilling to compromise, it could give up on negotiations, abandon a self-imposed moratorium and go back to testing nuclear bombs and missiles.
Kim made his remarks at a session in Pyongyang of a newly elected parliament — the result of voting last month in which all candidates ran unopposed. Kim further cemented his grip on power at the session with a big reshuffle of the country's leadership.
His other remarks pointed to economic belt-tightening in an attempt to ride out economic sanctions — and perhaps the Trump administration, too – while hanging on to his country's nuclear arsenal.
At the meeting, Kim was re-elected as Chairman of the State Affairs Commission. That means he retains, as expected, his posts as leader of the ruling party, state and military.
He added an extra honorary title though, ""Supreme Representative of all the Korean People,"" apparently for use in ceremonial and diplomatic occasions.
Long-serving officials such as 91-year-old Kim Yong Nam, the titular head of state, and Premier Pak Pong Ju, 80, were either retired or promoted to symbolic posts and replaced by younger officials.
On Wednesday, Kim he told ruling Workers' Party officials to make the country's economy self-sufficient, ""so as to deal a telling blow to the hostile forces who go with bloodshot eyes, miscalculating that sanctions can bring (North Korea) to its knees,"" the official Korean Central News Agency reported.
Politics No Agreement Reached At Second Nuclear Summit Kim's comments and his reshuffle of the leadership appear to have two aims, says Park Hyeong-jung, a North Korea expert at the Korea Institute for National Unification, or KINU , a government think-tank in Seoul.
""One is to double down on economic self-reliance, through strengthened mobilization,"" Park says. ""The second is to reinforce control over society."" He explains that tighter control is necessary because anecdotal evidence out of North Korea suggests the economy is deteriorating under the pressure of sanctions, and citizens feeling the pinch are starting to gripe .
There are fewer merchants and fewer customers, for example, in the ""jangmadang"" or free markets, Park says. And North Korean officials, he adds, are becoming more ""extractive"" and predatory, demanding bigger bribes from merchants as a sort of tax on the markets.
Politics South Korean Leader Looks To Jump-Start U.S.-North Korea Talks After Failed Summit Kim's expectations of tough times ahead seemed to anticipate President Trump's comments to visiting South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Thursday that he was unwilling to ease sanctions on the North, or make big concessions in nuclear negotiations.
Moon's trip to Washington was seen in Seoul as a crucial test of his role as mediator between North Korea and the U.S. South Korea's government had voiced hopes for a ""good-enough deal,"" and an ""early harvest."" In other words, a smaller, interim deal to get the denuclearization ball rolling.
But Trump mostly rebuffed Moon, saying ""at this moment, we're talking about the big deal. The big deal is we have to get rid of the nuclear weapons.""
Trump did leave some wiggle room for incremental progress. ""I'd have to see what the deal is,"" he told reporters. ""There are various smaller deals that maybe could happen.""
Asia President Trump Announces Halt To 'Additional Sanctions' On North Korea ""The question is what Kim can be convinced to give up at a future meeting, in exchange for what he left on the table in Hanoi,"" says Leif-Eric Easley, an international relations expert at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.
Trump and Kim failed to reach a deal in Hanoi in February, Easley says, because North Korea's offer to dismantle its main nuclear facility at Yongbyon was not enough for a comprehensive deal, while Pyongyang's ""asking price — the lifting of key U.N. Security Council resolutions — was unreasonably high.""
Seoul says Moon's next step will be to seek a fourth summit with Kim Jong Un to try to broker a deal.
But whether Kim Jong Un will be interested in another meeting is unclear, says KINU's Park Hyeong-jung.
""Probably, North Korea would assess that South Korea does not have much leverage to change U.S. attitudes,"" he says, as evidenced by Moon's meeting Thursday with Trump, and therefore Moon's usefulness as a broker is questionable."
Edible Archives Project Aims To Revive Hundreds Of Vanishing Indian Rice Strains : The Salt : NPR,www.npr.org,Charukesi Ramadurai,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/04/12/709979787/edible-archives-project-aims-to-revive-hundreds-of-vanishing-indian-rice-strains,"Enlarge this image Some of the 20 different types of rice used during the three-month festival Kochi-Muziris Biennale in India. Chefs served two varieties of rice every day, along with multiple dishes of vegetables and meat or seafood. Salam Olattayil/for NPR Salam Olattayil/for NPR Some of the 20 different types of rice used during the three-month festival Kochi-Muziris Biennale in India. Chefs served two varieties of rice every day, along with multiple dishes of vegetables and meat or seafood.
Salam Olattayil/for NPR Chef Anumitra Ghosh Dastidar fondly remembers her father's love for rice — and his insistence on having specific kinds of rice — with each special meat or fish dish cooked in their kitchen.
She even has memories of him making long road trips from their home in Kolkata, India, to other parts of the state of West Bengal to buy local rice. What motivated him, she says, was not just his interest in food but also nostalgia for his childhood.
Edible Archives was born partly from this recollection, with chef Anurima Ghosh Dastidar as curator, along with chef Prima Kurien and two food writers who were also invited to cook.
India is known to have cultivated thousands of varieties of rice, and references to rice — also combined with vegetables and meat, an ancient precursor to biryani, which came from Persia — have been found in Sangam literature from the 5th century B.C. Even a century ago, communities across India grew their own strains of rice, and consumed them according to the needs of the season or the cuisine.
During the Green Revolution in the 1960s, when machinery replaced manual work and ""high-yield variety"" seeds were promoted, agricultural output increased dramatically, but a few hybrid rice strains took over from hundreds of indigenous ones.
The Edible Archives Project aims to showcase the sheer range of rice varieties grown in India, and throw the spotlight specifically on those which have almost vanished from the country's foodscape or are grown only in small communities.

Courtesy of Edible Archives ""We don't document anything in India, so most of the old rice strains are gone, and the expert knowledge about them too,"" says Jayanthi Somasundaram, whose Spirit of the Earth collective sources and sells several varieties of organic heritage rice, including a few for this project.
Edible Archives formally opened at the Kochi-Muziris Biennale , an art festival that ran from Dec. 12 through March 29 in the south Indian city of Kochi, currently in its fourth edition. At the event, the chefs served two varieties of rice every day, along with multiple dishes of vegetables and meat or seafood. All of this was in what Dastidar calls ""homestyle cooking"" (as opposed to what is passed off in restaurants, especially outside India, as classic Indian cuisine, like butter chicken), using local vegetables such as drumstick ( moringa in vegetable form) and gourds. Writer-chef Priya Bala adds that the idea was also to present not just rice in all its glory, but preserve the dwindling knowledge about cooking methods, as well as revive lost recipes.
To spice things up, the chefs also played with fusion presentations, such as a Korean marinated egg over the aromatic Tulaipanji rice from West Bengal (a hit combination, as it turned out) and the Chicken Pepian, a Guatemalan Maya dish paired with the white, sweetish Chini Atap rice, also from the same Indian state, to complement the robust smokiness of the meat. ""Most importantly, the chefs also explained how pairing works, so as to balance all flavors and fragrances,"" Somasundaram says.
The Salt A Warming Planet Could Zap Nutrition From Rice That Feeds The World In three months, the team cooked with nearly 40 rice varieties from all over India, many of them not familiar to anyone outside the region of cultivation — like the Bahurupi from the state of Odisha or the Kattuyanam from Tamil Nadu. The rice of the day was described on a board at the venue, and on the social media pages of Edible Archives.
Drawing from her own nostalgia, Dastidar says that most Indians have ""an archive of rice memories, which we wanted to bring together."" In the midst of all the cooking and eating, there was also a two-day workshop called ""Recipes of Rice and Remembrance"" that included talks, cooking demonstrations, reminiscences and even songs related to rice.
Speaking of the latter, Bala points out that rice has found a place in Indian culture and literature over the ages, from a Bengali lullaby asking the angel aunties to come and put the baby to sleep, promising them delicious food in return — including three types of rice — to devotional songs from the state of Tamil Nadu that equate rice with prosperity.
The Salt Nepalese Rice Farmers Boost Yields By Sowing Fewer Plants And Cutting Water Indeed, rice has been an important, exceptional part of Indian rituals — from the ceremony during which a baby is first fed mashed rice as solid food , to the turmeric-infused yellow rice showered as blessing at weddings, to the final journey, where rice is an offering to the departed soul. Even the sick are fed kanji or khichuri (loose rice porridge, with or without lentils) as comfort food.
Dastidar has trained in Italian, Japanese and Thai cuisines, and learned how chefs in those countries tend to focus on grains from their own microregions. Much before the Edible Archives idea took shape, Dastidar was experimenting with rice varieties; think Manipuri Black Rice Risotto (a grain with starch content similar to Arborio) at New Delhi's popular restaurant Diva, where she was sous chef for many years.
The Salt In Southern India, The Spirit Of Ramadan Is Served In A Bowl Of Porridge With this experience, she traveled across the country to source the rice for Edible Archives — all of it was bought directly from small farmers or through agriculture collectives and non-governmental organizations who worked with cultivators. The exploratory phase included inputs from experts such as Dr. Debal Deb, who has researched and grown 1,300 varieties of rice at his farm Basudha in Odisha, and organic farmer Syed Ghani Khan, who established a rice museum in Karnataka that is home to more than 850 varieties.

Courtesy of Edible Archives Along with creating a record of cultural connotations and memories, Edible Archives also shared nutritional information about the rice of the day, trying to dispel the myth that rice is just a ""bad carb."" Case in point are two varieties from Tamil Nadu, where rice is the staple: Kattuyanam and Seeraga Samba, the former with a low glycemic index that makes it ideal for diabetics, and the latter highly fibrous and rich in selenium to fight colon and intestinal cancers. The chefs gleaned this information from scientific articles and agricultural journals, as well as from Basudha's in-house magazine.
The Salt 'Khichuri': An Ancient Indian Comfort Dish With A Global Influence In the future, Edible Archives plans to hold pop-up events across the country and eventually abroad. There have already been a few in Indian cities, and one in Paris coming up in June that will focus on cuisine from India's seven northeast states, which are still largely under-explored in terms of tourism, culture and cuisine. The chefs say they mean to keep the dialogue going with talks and lectures ""wherever food and culture meet.""
As Bala puts it, ""we need to continue the celebration of a grain that is sustenance, comfort, nutrition and auspiciousness all at once.""

How Empathy Can Contribute To Violence : Shots - Health News,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/12/712682406/does-empathy-have-a-dark-side,"Enlarge this image Christina Chung for NPR Christina Chung for NPR Empathy seems like a good quality in human beings. Pure and simple.
It allows us to consider the perspective of others — to put ourselves in their shoes and imagine their experiences. From that empathetic vantage point, only good things can come, right?
Not necessarily, according to author Fritz Breithaupt . ""Sometimes we commit atrocities not out of a failure of empathy but rather as a direct consequence of successful, even overly successful, empathy,"" he writes in his forthcoming book The Dark Sides of Empathy .
Listen: The End of Empathy Episode 6 of Invisibilia's Season 5 tells the same story twice in order to examine the questions: Who deserves our empathy? And is there a wrong way to empathize? Listen here.
Breithaupt, who directs the Experimental Humanities Lab at Indiana University, argues that empathy is a morally ambiguous capacity, one that can lead us astray if we don't understand its many sides.
""Empathy is a riddle,"" Breithaupt says. While it can enrich our lives, Breithaupt says our ability to identify with others' feelings can also fuel polarization, spark violence and motivate dysfunctional behavior in relationships, like helicopter parenting.
Breithaupt, who reviews the cultural and scientific history of empathy in his book, explains that empathy is a relatively new concept. The term only emerged in 1909, when it was translated from a German conception of ""feeling yourself into a work of art,"" he says. In the past 40 years, it has risen to prominence as evolutionary biologists started to explore its role in shaping the human brain. Since then, it's become a core psychological concept, and part of what biologists think makes us distinctly human.
Since empathy is baked into our very being, Breithaupt argues that we must be aware of the good and bad it can enable. NPR's Jonathan Lambert spoke with him about empathy's biological and moral dimensions.
The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.
How does science define empathy, and what light does that shed on on more philosophical conceptions of it?
For a while neuroscientists thought there was an empathy center in the brain, some little spot somewhere. They thought we could understand this spot and then understand empathy.
But then they came to a much larger realization: Empathy is not in one place in our brains; it's everywhere. Imaging studies showed that we use every part of the brain both for our own actions, our own feelings, but also for the observation of other people. So basically the whole brain does empathy.
That changes a lot of things. It shows us that empathy affects all our thinking. It's with us every moment.
I think that means that empathy is so important to us that it's something we can't neglect. Yes, we're biologically primed for it, but we also have to cultivate it, and cultivation is something that can [be a] lifelong learning task. It never ends.

Amazon Independent Booksellers So science seems to suggest that empathy is sort of baked into our being. I think most people might assume that's a good thing. Why is it not necessarily?
I'm not going to try to convince you to say that empathy is bad or that we should be against empathy. I think it's fundamental for us. It's absolutely something that we have to understand to know how we operate.
I also think that in most cases empathy does more good than bad things. I want to put it in proportion — there are dark sides to empathy.
People assume that empathy is good because it is good for the recipient of empathy — I'm actually skeptical about this.
Empathy might be a little bit more selfish than many people assume. The empathizer feels less alone, they share experiences, they learn something. So we should ask for whom is [empathy] good? It's actually the empathizer in most cases.
How is empathy good for the empathizer?
Beings without empathy live in their own world. They can't really understand that other beings are out there with minds of their own. But beings with empathy understand that there are all these different minds around [that] have different experiences and different feelings. They can participate in them. Someone with empathy lives more than one life. Of course, sometimes that means that you have to carry the suffering of others, but in many cases their joy becomes your joy. So it's a richer, much more complex life. And in that sense, of course empathy is wonderful for you.
But there's a flip side too, right? In your book you talk about something you call ""vampiristic empathy."" What do you mean by that?
Vampiristic empathy is a form of empathy where people want to manipulate the people they empathize with so that they can, through them, experience the world in such a way that they really enjoy it.
An extreme case of this is helicopter parenting. Helicopter parents are constantly trying to steer their kids in the directions they think are the right directions. Of course they want the best for their children. Very understandable; I have kids and I want what's best for them too.
But I think there's something else seeping in. There's this sort of living along with the kids, imagining how it must be like to have a life that's marked by successes, where obstacles disappear and life can be enjoyed. But that also means that the parents are co-experiencing that life, so they start taking over ... they basically want to use the child almost as a pawn.
In a sense, extreme helicopter parents are robbing their kids of a selfhood so that they can basically project their own self into these kids.
You write that empathy can actually make us more polarized instead of bringing us together. How can that happen?
People imagine that empathy can help resolve tensions in cases of conflict, but very often empathy is exactly that thing that leads to the extremes, that polarizes people even more.
It can happen this way, be it a family feud or something that escalates to a civil war. Humans are very quick to take sides. And when you take one side, you take the perspective of that side. You can see the painful parts of that perspective and empathize with them, and that empathy can fuel seeing the other side as darker and darker or more dubious.
One example of this comes from Northern Ireland, which has a long history of conflict. In the early 2000s school administrators there tried to resolve the conflict between the Catholic and Protestant youth by bringing empathy into the curriculum.
They emphasized that students would learn both sides, and the atrocities committed by one side or the other were always put into context. Students learned this curriculum, but follow-up studies showed that this new generation was more polarized than the one before.
So what this group had internalized was there's always two sides and, in the end, they know their side. So they reorganized this information to empathize with people on their side and withdraw from the other side.
So Northern Ireland had to abandon this project.
The other case is that of terrorists. I think a lot of terrorists may not lack empathy. Rather, they see some plight of a group they identify with — they see them suffering and see it as something horrible, and that becomes more extreme and activates them to become active terrorists.
Are there other downsides to empathy?
[Empathizers] may overextend themselves. If you are a medical doctor who sees a lot of suffering and pain every day, it can very quickly become too much. Something like a third of medical doctors suffer from ""empathy burnout"" that is so severe that it affects their functioning as doctors and their personal life. They become the victim of feeling empathy.
In the end though, doesn't empathy cause more good than harm?
In one sense, yes. Empathy is weakly correlated with altruistic behavior. So there is a connection. I do think empathy can help people help each other, and that makes us human.
My core argument here is that in many cases of altruistic help or humanitarian aid, people actually don't really empathize as much with the person in need. They identify more with the helper, the hero, the person who intervenes even if it's an imaginary helper.
It can be good when it leads to good action, but it can have downsides. For example, if you want the victims to say 'thank you.' You may even want to keep the people you help in that position of inferior victim because it can sustain your feeling of being a hero.
If you want recognition and if that doesn't come, it can turn into resentment. That's an unfortunately common impulse. On the political scale, I think it happened in Germany. In 2015 Germany opened its borders, very laudably, to refugees. Initially there was a wave of huge enthusiasm, and then suddenly a huge drop in enthusiasm and a lot of resentment.
What are your big takeaways about empathy?
I think we can learn to use empathy in a somewhat controlled way. We can learn when to block it, when to not allow empathy to be manipulated and when to fully turn it on.
Yes, we are born with empathy, but it needs constant practice [to know] when to use it and when not to use it. So the dark sides are so important to know because they teach us that in some cases you shouldn't empathize.
But when it's good, we should embrace empathy, because it can lead to such richer, fuller lives.

toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images A Chevron customer pumps gas into his car in 2009 in Greenbrae, Calif. Chevron is acquiring Anadarko Petroleum for $33 billion in cash and stock.
Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Multinational oil giant Chevron will buy the American oil and gas production and exploration company Anadarko Petroleum in a $33 billion cash-and-stock deal that strengthens Chevron's position in the booming Permian Basin.
The deal has been approved by both companies' boards and is expected to be finalized later this year. Anadarko's stock surged on the news. Chevron stock dipped, but analyst Jason Gammel of Jefferies predicts the market's negative reaction will be short-lived.
The deal ""will unlock significant value for shareholders, generating anticipated annual run-rate synergies of approximately $2 billion,"" Chevron CEO Michael Wirth said in a statement.
Environment Trump Signs Executive Orders In Push To Make It Easier To Build Oil And Gas Pipelines Anadarko has sizable natural gas assets in Mozambique and is the largest foreign oil producer in Algeria. It's also a major producer in the Gulf of Mexico.
Perhaps most significantly, buying Anadarko will give Chevron access to valuable acreage in West Texas, in the Permian Basin.
Booming production in that region, powered by a revolution in technology that opened access to shale and other difficult-to-access formations, has turned the U.S. into an oil-exporting nation. Small and midsize companies played a dominant role in the whirlwind expansion of Permian production.
But now large multinationals like Chevron and Exxon Mobil are doubling down on their investments in the region.
Environment And Energy Collaborative In Midst Of An Oil Boom, New Mexico Sets Bold New Climate Goals With the purchase of Anadarko, ""we will now see Chevron emerging as the clear leader among all Permian players, both in terms of production growth and as a cost leader,"" predicts Per Magnus Nysveen, the head of research at Rystad Energy.
""The combined entity will be by far the largest producer in the Permian, which is the fastest growing basin in the world,"" Nysveen says.
Chevron, which has headquarters in California, will ""jump ahead of Shell and BP"" in size after the merger, he notes."

John Moore/Getty Images John Moore/Getty Images A guard escorts a detained immigrant from his ""segregation cell"" back into the general population at the Adelanto Detention Facility in November 2013. Today the privately run ICE facility in Adelanto, Calif., houses nearly 2,000 men and women and has come under sharp criticism by the California attorney general and other investigators for health and safety problems.
John Moore/Getty Images It's Saturday morning and the women of the Contreras family are busy in Montclair, Calif., making pupusas, tamales and tacos. They're working to replace the income of José Contreras, who has been held since last June at Southern California's Adelanto ICE Processing Center , a privately run immigration detention center.
José's daughter, Giselle, drives around in an aging minivan collecting food orders. First a hospital, then a car wash, then a local bank.
Giselle's father crossed from Guatemala more than two decades ago, without authorization to enter the U.S. He worked in construction until agents picked him up and brought him to Adelanto.
National DHS Watchdog Finds 'Significant' Health And Safety Risks For Immigrants At ICE Center Giselle says her father languished there for three months without his diabetes medication. Now, she says, the guards give it to him at odd times during the day and night. And, she says, ICE agents took his eyeglasses so he can't read legal documents or write letters.
""My aunt tried to take in glasses for him but they don't allow for us to give them anything,"" Giselle tells me as she steers the minivan. ""They tell us that they give them everything they need."" When I ask if her father has glasses now, she says, ""No, he doesn't. He doesn't have glasses.""
Maria Contreras, José's sister, makes papusas and other food for sale in Southern California — to help support the family while José is in detention at the ICE Adelanto Processing Center. He has been held there for months without his glasses or requested counseling for depression, she says, and doesn't get his diabetes medication when he needs it. Sarah Varney/Kaiser Health News Sarah Varney/Kaiser Health News Giselle says her father, who is 60 years old, is terrified of being deported, and she says the regimented world inside Adelanto is driving him into a deep depression. ""His conversations now have become shorter,"" she says. ""He doesn't talk to us and ask, 'How's your day? How you been?' He's always looking down at the ground; he doesn't want to make eye contact for the same reason that he's so depressed.""
José's sister, Maria Contreras, visits her brother every Saturday. She has urged him to see a psychologist at Adelanto, but he tells her that even though he filled out a medical request, he doesn't get any help. ""No response, or anything,"" Maria says.
National Big Money As Private Immigrant Jails Boom National ICE Failed to Hold Detention Center Contractors Accountable, Report Finds Adelanto sits on a desolate stretch of road in the high desert about an hour north of the city of Riverside. Nearly 2,000 men and women are held here. Some arrived recently during the surge in border crossings. Others lived in the U.S. — undocumented and undetected — for years. In the visiting room, where detainees are brought in wearing blue, orange or red baggy pants and tops, a sign on the wall reads, ""Don't give up hope.""
José Contreras with his family, in happier times. He came to the U.S. from Guatemala without authorization more than two decades ago and worked in construction until agents picked him up and took him to Adelanto. Sarah Varney/Kaiser Health News Sarah Varney/Kaiser Health News The facility — run by a federal contractor, GEO Group , a for-profit company based in Boca Raton, Fla., that runs private prisons — has a troubled past. During an unannounced visit last year, federal inspectors from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General found ""nooses"" made out of bedsheets in 15 out of 20 cells. The inspectors found that guards overlooked the nooses even though a detainee had died by suicide using a bedsheet in 2017 and several others had attempted suicide using a similar method. The government audit concluded GEO Group guards improperly handcuffed and shackled detainees, unnecessarily placed detainees in solitary confinement and failed to provide adequate medical care.
A separate investigation of Adelanto and other immigration detention facilities in California released in February by state Attorney General Xavier Becerra found similar health and safety problems and concluded that detainees were treated like prisoners, some kept in their cells for 22 hours a day, even though they have not been charged with a crime. A state law passed in 2017 directs the state to inspect and report on the treatment of immigrant detainees held in California.
The alleged cases documented in the most recent report by Disability Rights California, a watchdog group with legal oversight to protect people with disabilities in the Golden State, are grim: detainees slitting their wrists; discontinued medication for depression; and ignored requests for wheelchairs and walkers. At least one detainee said that guards pepper-sprayed him when he did not stand up and a second time while he tried to hang himself.
In a written statement, GEO Group says it ""strongly disputes the claims"" in the report and that the remedies recommended by Disability Rights California ""were already in place.""
""We are deeply committed,"" the company says, ""to delivering high-quality, culturally responsive services in safe and humane environments."" An ICE spokesperson says, in an emailed statement, that GEO Group's Adelanto facility is in ""full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.""
But Mario, who was inside Adelanto for six months in 2018, says the report describes his own experiences there. ""What's happening is all those claims that have been made against GEO and the staff in the medical department are finally being backed up by reports,"" Mario says.
He asked us not to use his last name since he is out on bond and still fighting deportation. Mario is now 32; he crossed the border with his parents without documentation when he was 5.
Embedded A Remote Town, A Closed-Off Courtroom, And A Father Facing Deportation National Detained Fathers Turn To Hunger Strike In 2017, he was convicted of a misdemeanor and ICE agents picked him up at his home in Ontario, Calif. At the time, Mario was seeing a therapist for depression and taking medication. It took three weeks to get back on antidepressants, he says, and the sessions with the psychologists at Adelanto were only cursory.
""They keep their actual sessions to five to 10 minutes,"" he says. ""It's basically like a quick check-in. They just ask you, 'How are you? Do you have any suicidal thoughts? When is your next court date?' It's one of those things that I feel is basically done just to say, 'All right, we did it.' ""
Mario is gay and lived in a room with three other men, including a gay man from Mexico who was seeking asylum. The two men became close friends.
""He was persecuted in Mexico because of being gay,"" Mario says. Months of detention ""and not getting any mental health care really took a toll on him. And that's when he cut himself. He cut his wrist with a razor blade that we get to shave. And after that he was placed in solitary confinement for about a week.""
Mario says when his friend came back to their room, he was taking some sort of medication. ""After that, all he did was sleep,"" Mario says. ""When the food was ready I'd go call him: 'OK, it's time to eat.' ""
Other detainees and immigration lawyers described a similar pattern, of GEO psychiatrists prescribing antipsychotic medications that make people sleep much of the time. It's one of the reasons people were reluctant to seek help, Mario says. But also, like other detainees, he was worried about being labeled as depressed.
""I couldn't express whenever I was extremely feeling sad or depressed or anxious because I was afraid that would be used against me in court,"" he explains.
Judges cannot use mental health conditions to deny legal status to a detainee, according to immigration attorneys.
Last month , long after GEO Group says the company addressed any problems detailed in the Disability Rights California report, detainees in Adelanto staged a hunger strike. The detainees gave an attorney a handwritten note, which was released by the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, an advocacy group.
Chief among their demands was speedier access to good medical care."

Trump Threatens To Send Detained Immigrants To 'Sanctuary Cities',www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712760676/trump-threatens-to-send-detained-immigrants-to-sanctuary-cities,"Enlarge this image President Trump told reporters that he is considering sending immigrants in the country illegally to ""sanctuary cities"" as retribution against Democrats, an idea his administration said had been rejected after reports emerged Thursday night. Alex Wong/Getty Alex Wong/Getty Images President Trump told reporters that he is considering sending immigrants in the country illegally to ""sanctuary cities"" as retribution against Democrats, an idea his administration said had been rejected after reports emerged Thursday night.
Alex Wong/Getty Images Updated Saturday 8:47 p.m. ET
President Trump confirmed reports that he is strongly considering sending detained immigrants in the country illegally to ""sanctuary cities"" to try to punish Democrats who have opposed his stringent immigration proposals. The comments came hours after White House and Homeland Security officials said the idea had been scrapped.
""We'll bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it, whether it's a state or whatever it might be,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.
Then he went on to mention California. ""We'll give them more people. We can give them a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply, and let's see if they're so happy. They say, 'We have open arms,' "" Trump said.
The president took to Twitter earlier in the day to say that Democrats have been unwilling to change immigration laws, prompting his administration to consider ""placing"" such immigrants there.
....The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy – so this should make them very happy!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2019 He returned to the issue again on Saturday, calling on Democrats to change the nation's immigration laws. ""If not, Sanctuary Cities must immediately ACT to take care of the Illegal Immigrants,"" he tweeted .
The president's comments follow a Washington Post report on Thursday that White House officials had been considering such a move ""to retaliate against President Trump's political adversaries.""
Trump aides had reportedly proposed such a transfer twice — last November, as a migrant caravan seeking asylum in the U.S. approached the country's border with Mexico, and again in February during a fight with Congress over funding for his border wall following a 35-day government shutdown that eventually resulted in his declaring a national emergency to obtain the funds.
Politics McConnell's 2020 Plan: Cast GOP As 'Firewall' Against Socialism Also according to the Post, the White House argued to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that its plan was designed to find a solution to a lack of detention space along with ""political retribution"" against Democrats. But ICE lawyers ""rejected the idea as inappropriate and rebuffed the administration.""
""Sanctuary cities"" are places where local law enforcement limit cooperation with federal immigration officials, as a way to protect immigrants who are in the United States illegally from being deported.
One of the cities Trump had reportedly hoped to target was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco district. When asked by reporters on Friday morning about the Post 's report, prior to Trump's tweet confirmation, she said she wasn't aware of it but that such an idea was disrespectful to the country.
""I don't know anything about it,"" Pelosi said, ""but, again, it's just another notion that is unworthy of the presidency of the United States and disrespectful of the challenges that we face as a country, as a people, to address who we are: a nation of immigrants.""
Politics Democratic Candidates Are Releasing Tax Returns, Answering Big Questions For Voters UnidosUS, a Latino civil rights organization that was formerly known as the National Council of La Raza, said in a statement that Trump's threats were ""beyond reprehensible.""
""It seems that not only is President Trump attempting to utilize human beings, who have already experienced a traumatic situation, as tools to get back at political foes, but as a vehicle to further divide communities by stoking racial tensions,"" UnidosUS President and CEO Janet Murguia said in a statement.

How Much Did WikiLeaks Damage U.S. National Security? : NPR,www.npr.org,Greg Myre,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712659290/how-much-did-wikileaks-damage-u-s-national-security,"Enlarge this image WikiLeaks has made multiple disclosures over the past decade, including one in March 2017 when the group released what it said were CIA technical documents on a range of spying techniques. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images WikiLeaks has made multiple disclosures over the past decade, including one in March 2017 when the group released what it said were CIA technical documents on a range of spying techniques.
Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images To its supporters, the WikiLeaks disclosures have revealed a wealth of important information that the U.S. government wanted to keep hidden, particularly in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
This included abuses by the military and a video that showed a U.S. helicopter attack in Iraq on suspected militants. Those killed turned out to be unarmed civilians and journalists.
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, now under arrest in Britain, has often argued that no one has been harmed by the WikiLeaks disclosures.
National Security Julian Assange Arrested, Faces U.S. Charges Related To 2010 WikiLeaks Releases But many in the national security community say the leaks were harmful to a broad range of people. However, they generally say the damage was limited and has faded since the first big WikiLeaks dump in 2010, which included hundreds of thousands of classified documents from the U.S. military and the State Department.
National Security 12 Years Of Disruption: A WikiLeaks Timeline Chelsea Manning, a former Army private, spent seven years in prison for leaking the documents to WikiLeaks in 2010. Manning, who was freed two years ago, was taken back into custody last month when she refused to testify before a grand jury in a case involving WikiLeaks and Assange.
P.J. Crowley , the State Department spokesman when the WikiLeaks story erupted in 2010, said those most at risk were civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq who were secretly passing information to the U.S. military.
""A number of people went into hiding, a number of people had to move, particularly those civilians in war zones who had told U.S. soldiers about movements of the Taliban and al-Qaida,"" he said. ""No doubt some of those people were harmed when their identities were compromised.""
WikiLeaks has made multiple disclosures over the past decade, including one in March 2017 when the group released what it said were CIA technical documents on a range of spying techniques.
This revealed ways that a state-of-the art television could serve as a listening device even when it was turned off.
Larry Pfeiffer , the CIA chief of staff from 2006 to 2009, said these kinds of breaches can impose long-term costs, though they can be difficult to quantify.
""It informs the potential enemies of a technique we use, that they can now develop countermeasures against,"" Pfeiffer said.
This also forces the spy agency to go back to the drawing board, he added.
""Once invalidated, it now creates situations where the U.S. intelligence community is going to have to expend resources and going to have to spend both dollars and people to develop new methods,"" said Pfeiffer, who now heads the Michael V. Hayden Center for Intelligence at George Mason University.
On the diplomatic front, WikiLeaks shared many examples of U.S. diplomats writing in unflattering terms about foreign leaders, causing the U.S. embarrassment.
But more importantly, said Scott Anderson , a former State Department lawyer who served in Iraq in 2012 and 2013, some of these countries have vulnerable opposition leaders and human rights activists who were quietly in contact with U.S. diplomats. These private, sensitive discussions suddenly became public with the WikiLeaks dumps.
""That can really chill the ability of those American personnel to build those sorts of relationships and have frank conversations with their contacts,"" said Anderson, now at the Brookings Institution.
Anderson notes that the U.S. still has a program to issue visas to Afghans and Iraqis to the U.S. in return for the help they provided — and in recognition of the danger they face.
Crowley pointed to the impact of leaks that upset former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
""We had an ambassador in Libya, and we had to remove him from his post because he was directly threatened by Moammar Gadhafi's thugs,"" Crowley said.
Some countries, Crowley added, took a much more relaxed approach to the disclosures, even when they were criticized in the documents.
""One foreign minister told the U.S. secretary of state, 'You know, don't worry about it. You should see what we report about you,' "" Crowley recalled.
Many of the assessments today are similar to the one offered nine years ago by Bob Gates, who served as defense secretary when the WikiLeaks disclosures took place.
""The fact is, governments deal with the United States because it's in their interest. Not because they like us, not because they trust us and not because they believe we can keep secrets,"" Gates said. ""Is this embarrassing? Yes. Is it awkward? Yes. Consequences for U.S. foreign policy? I think fairly modest.""

He spoke to Fresh Air in 2016 about the story behind the title of his hit sit-com Everybody Loves Raymond.
Television Ray Romano Gets Deep, Dark And Angsty For Martin Scorsese's 'Vinyl' Hear The Original Interview in for Terry Gross. Comic, actor and writer Ray Romano has been plying his craft for a long time and is still finding new ways to challenge himself. He's most famous as the star of the CBS sitcom ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" one of the most successful recent examples of the old-fashioned multi-camera TV sitcom. But he's also challenged himself as an actor, starring in such dramatic roles as a man with a midlife crisis in TNT's ""Men Of A Certain Age,"" a photographer on the autism spectrum in NBC's ""Parenthood"" and a record promoter in HBO's ""Vinyl.""
Terry Gross spoke to Ray Romano in 2016, the year ""Vinyl"" premiered. This year, Ray Romano returned to the format that got him started - stand-up comedy in a Netflix special called ""Ray Romano: Right Here, Around the Corner."" It was his first stand-up special in 23 years. Here he is on the topic of being a father of a 16-year-old son.
(SOUNDBITE OF COMEDY SPECIAL, ""RAY ROMANO: RIGHT HERE, AROUND THE CORNER"")
RAY ROMANO: And now he drives. Why do we give 16-year-olds licenses? My son doesn't care about anything. He called me today like, hey, Dad, I'm in the car. Yeah, I don't know. I guess I'm out of gas right now.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: What do you mean you don't know, Joe? Are you moving?
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Is the car moving? I'm not moving. I'm not moving. I put my foot on the pedal, I'm not going anywhere right now. All right. Well, all right. Where are you, Joe? And he's very calm, now, he's la-de-da (ph). I'm here. I'm on the 101. The 101 is a five-lane highway.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Nothing. So I assume, like anybody would, oh, you're on the side of the road, now? No, I'm in the middle lane right now.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: What do you mean, Joe? Where's the urgency? I swear to you, this is the exchange 'cause I'm panicking now. What's the traffic like? Well, behind me, it's bad. But it's moving in front of me.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: I'm going to kick your ass, Joe, 'cause you need fear. You need fear in your life.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: And my wife tries to spin it. You know, whatever he does, she puts the spin on it. Well, he doesn't panic. He's Zen. He's a very Zen-like boy, like astronauts. Maybe he'll be an astronaut one day. Oh, you think so? Really? I don't want to burst your bubble, but if he can't interpret the gas gauge on a Mazda...
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: ...No, he ain't getting in a space shuttle, I'll tell you right now. Give that up.
BIANCULLI: It was 24 years ago, in 1995, when David Letterman gave Ray Romano his big break by inviting him to do stand-up on ""The Late Show."" A week later, Ray got a call from Letterman's production company, saying they were interested in creating a sitcom around him, which turned out to be the show ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" Here's that 1995 stand-up routine from Romano's original appearance on ""Letterman.""
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN"")
ROMANO: I have a 3-year-old daughter and twin 2-year-old boys.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Wow. Thank you. Single people are here.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Single people are like, yay, twins. Parents - oh, that could have been us. Oh, my God.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: I'll tell you. You know, it doesn't matter if you laugh or not. I'm just happy to be out of the house right now. I'll be honest with you.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: I will be honest. You know, it's horrible. I make little excuses now just to get out of my house for a few minutes. I'll do anything. Anybody, do you need anything? Anything at all, anything?
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Anything from the motor vehicle bureau? How about that?
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: Can I register something? It's on my way. I'm going that way. I'm just going to go apply for jury duty, that's all. Let me out.
 So when David Letterman had you on the show for the first time in 1995, and he...
ROMANO: Yeah.
GROSS: ...Was so taken with your comedy that he wanted to build a sitcom around you, you must have been shocked.
ROMANO: Yeah. They called my house, by the way. I lived in Queens. I was in a small house in Queens. And it was a Saturday. First of all, who's calling your house - what executive producer from the show is calling you at your house, and not your manager or agent, and on a Saturday?
And here's where I was. I was - I had been doing stand-up for 11 years. I did Johnny Carson in 1991. I did Leno a couple times. I did every stand-up show they had, ""Evening At The Improv,"" the MTV - all those shows. I had my own HBO half-hour, and I loved doing it. I loved doing stand-up.
I was happy to be doing what I loved, but I was - I kind of reached a plateau, I guess, of where I was going to go. And if that's all I did for the rest of my career, you know, it's - it doesn't suck to be doing what you love to do. And Letterman, after I'd done my Letterman set, I kind of thought, well, that was a really good set. So let's see if it had - you know, maybe somebody? And it was Letterman. It was Letterman who was watching from 20 feet away.
And they called me. And I remember my wife saying, Rob Burnett's on the phone. I was in the backyard. I don't know what I was doing. I was hosing off the kids. And I picked the phone up. I was kind of surprised. And he said, listen, Dave liked what he saw. And so we just want to - we just want to say, I just want to tell you that we're interested. So let's see what happens.
Just know, don't - before you sign anything else with anybody else, we're interested. And then, right away - I told them right there, nobody's - there is nobody else. You know, if you're interested, I'm interested. And sure enough, we signed a deal. And here I am.
GROSS: (Laughter) You know, in watching back your appearance - your last appearance on the Letterman show, you started to tear up. Your voice cracked on that.
ROMANO: Yeah, I did.
GROSS: You got very emotional because he had, you know, giving you the green light to have a sitcom. I mean, he really changed your life so profoundly. That show was so successful.
ROMANO: Yeah. Yeah, I'm getting emotional now when I think about it. But yeah, it's true. Look; there are many things that happened in my life. There are many milestones. There are many things that got me to where I am but none more so than the five minutes I did on ""Letterman"" that night. And then I did - you know, for the next 20 years, I was on his show at least once - sometimes twice. And then - so for him - when he was retiring, it was something. I mean, it changed my life. It changed my children's life. I mean, I'd still like to think we'd be the same people. I think I am - but so many more opportunities. So just to see him go away into - yeah. I mean, it all kind of welled up in me.
I'll tell you one little story. I'm kind - I'm a kind of superstitious guy - and sometimes too superstitious. But the night that I did the first ""Letterman,"" he was doing a bit about - it was springtime, so he was doing a bit about cutting your pants - summer-izing (ph) your pants. And he took someone from the audience, and he cut their pants into shorts. And then he took Paul Schaefer, and he cut Paul Schaefer's pants into shorts. And then Mel Gibson was the first guest. And he took Mel Gibson's, and he cut his. And then he said, well, I've got to do mine. And he cut his own pants into shorts.
So I was backstage, and I'm watching this. And you know - so I'm talking with my manager (unintelligible). And we're like - and I'm like, should I - do I cut my pants? Do I go out with my pants? And they're like, you've got to do it (laughter). And one of the one of the writers - producers came over with, like, scissors and says, well, you've got to go out - when they introduce you, you've got to go out with your pants cut. And I - we literally were - I had the scissors in my hand. I'm making a big deal out of this, and I probably shouldn't.
But I had the scissors in my hand, and we were ready to cut my pants into shorts. So when Dave Letterman announces this new comic - Ray Romano, here he is - and I walk out, you're going to see my bare calves and knees and I'm part of the joke. And at the last second, I thought, I'm not going to do it. I'm going to just - I don't want to assume I'm part of the clique. I'm part of - you know, I'm the - they don't even know who I am. And now I'm going to go out and be in on the joke. And I don't know. It's too presumptuous; it's too whatever. So I decided not to.
And I went out, and I had the - what I thought was probably one of my best TV sets. And it turned into this - and I still believe had I cut those pants into shorts, the dynamic - something's different. Maybe I have a good set, but there's something. And who knows whether or not all of this happens if I cut my pants into shorts?
GROSS: Well, that's really interesting.
ROMANO: (Laughter).
GROSS: You know what? I'm - here's part of the - how the dynamic might have been different. It would have not only been that, like, you were in on the joke - you know, a part of the clique or whatever. But the audience's first reaction to you would've been like - oh, he's got bony legs or something like that, or, like, doesn't he look funny in those foolish looking shorts that used to be pants a few minutes ago.
ROMANO: Yes, it's distracting. It's distracting.
GROSS: And it takes away from thinking - oh, it's a new comic. I wonder what he's going to talk about.
ROMANO: I don't know if you're kidding or not, but I think...
GROSS: No, I'm not kidding.
ROMANO: ...You're absolutely right.
GROSS: No, I mean that sincerely. Like, it would've...
ROMANO: Well, good. You're...
GROSS: ...Been so off-topic to distract people into thinking about, like, your bony legs and laughing at that when you had, like, genuine comedy to deliver.
ROMANO: Well, I want to say two things. One, I have - my bottom half of my legs are...
GROSS: I didn't mean to assume about your legs (laughter).
ROMANO: ...Fantastic. But that might have been distracting - that they're too good looking. But...
GROSS: Get a load of those gams.
ROMANO: ...I believe that, you know?
GROSS: Yeah.
ROMANO: I have told this story to other people. And they're like, you would have been fine. Don't worry about it. And then what - a little end to this story is when ""Raymond"" was going off the air - when the last episode was airing, I appeared on ""Letterman"" that night. And so to bring it full circle, I cut my pants into shorts on that episode just 'cause, you know, what I didn't do 10 years ago, I did for the last episode, yeah.
GROSS: Oh, that's funny. Yeah.
ROMANO: Yeah. So that was cool.
GROSS: That's great.
ROMANO: But I believe those kind of things. I'm like, who knows what would have happened, the whole trickle-down effect? Who knows?
GROSS: Yeah.
BIANCULLI: Ray Romano speaking to Terry Gross in 2016 - more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONNY ROLLINS AND TOMMY FLANAGAN'S ""H.S."")
 2016 interview with comic actor and writer Ray Romano. His first stand-up comedy special in 23 years, ""Ray Romano: Right Here, Around The Corner,"" is now on Netflix.
 So when you started on ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" the show was - it was kind of billed as like very loosely based on your life - you know, a married man, father of three kids - a daughter and two twin boys and whose parents lived very nearby and who are always kind of showing up and visiting a little too long. And (laughter)...
ROMANO: Yes.
GROSS: ...You know, it's kind of interfering with the married life of this couple.
Did you have a long talk with your family before the show started and say - you know, to say - hey, people are going to be making assumptions about who you really are based on the characters in the sitcom. Some of those assumptions will be true; some of them will be false. Some of the portrayals are going to be more negative than the way I really feel about you. Or you know, like, what kind of (laughter) - what kind of heart-to-heart did you have?
ROMANO: Well, I didn't have a talk before. But I had a couple of talks during (laughter). First of all, let me just say that, you know, I - thank God for Phil Rosenthal, who - you know, they hooked me up with Phil Rosenthal, who wrote the pilot script. And we talked about our families together. And Phil took his parents and my parents and kind of melded them together to become those parents. So it wasn't an exact portrayal of every - down to, you know, the nitty-gritty of my family.
But the only real issue was maybe the brother character 'cause my brother is a New York police officer - or was then at that time. And he actually coined the phrase - I don't know how many people know this. But the title ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" it's - I mean, I guess most people do, but some still don't. It's said sarcastically in the pilot - in the pilot episode.
And this is a quote from my brother, my real-life brother, who was a police officer. And he would come in and - in real life, he would come over. And he'd see - what? - I got an award, or I got something for stand-up comedy. And he would jokingly, kind of tongue-in-cheek he'd say, well, look at Raymond. Raymond gets awards when he goes to work. You know, when I go to work, people shoot at me.
GROSS: (Laughter).
ROMANO: People spit at me. When Raymond goes, everybody loves Raymond. So I told this story to Phil. And Phil said, oh, that's - we have to use that. We have to use that as the title. And I said, well, please don't. And he said, well, let's just use it as the working title. And then we'll change it when - you know, when it comes time to go to pilot. And of course, Les Moonves, the head of CBS, fell in love with the title. And he would not - I tried desperately to change that title.
GROSS: Why?
ROMANO: Nobody wants (laughter) that. It's just asking for trouble.
GROSS: People taking it at face value, thinking that you think that everybody loves you.
ROMANO: Well, even if they don't take it at face value, to this day - to this day, someone will start an article with, well, not everybody loves Raymond, and this and that.
GROSS: (Laughter).
ROMANO: And yeah, but as far as my family, my brother, who was this tough street cop and a real good cop and really dedicated - and the way Brad Garrett was being portrayed - was portraying him - was slightly goofy. And my mother used to say to me, why - why do they have to make him so goofy? Why did - and I'm - Ma, it's just - it's fictional. It's nothing, you know.
But my brother then became - first of all, he loved what Brad Garrett, the character that he became. And - and we did a couple episodes to show what a good cop he was and what a good soul he was. And my brother was very into that. And he met Brad. And he told Brad that he's proud that he's portraying him.
And not only that, my brother was single at the - at the time, or some point at the time. And he became a little mini - mini celebrity. So I think he was more than happy to be portrayed in this - you know, in any TV show.
GROSS: So what was it like when you started on ""Everybody Loves Raymond""? You're the star of this network sitcom. And I don't think you'd ever really had an acting job before. (Laughter).
ROMANO: No.
GROSS: So everybody's relying on you to be really great in this, and you're, like, not experienced.
ROMANO: No, I had - the one experience I had was getting fired from a sitcom. I got fired from ""NewsRadio."" I don't know if you remember the show ""NewsRadio.""
GROSS: I do remember the show.
ROMANO: Yeah, I was - I was in the original cast. I was - I was hired for the original cast. And on day two of rehearsal for the pilot, I got - I got let go (laughter). Or they went in another direction is what - is what they told us. And I - and I deserved to be fired, I think.
And, you know, I can - I can say now - and even then I kind of knew I was out of my league. I was - I wasn't ready. It just - it didn't feel right. I had a great audition. I - the showrunner saw me, saw my HBO special and asked for me to come in and read. And I had a great audition. He was cracking up. And he just wanted to hire me right there. And he did.
And then I performed for the network. And then at the table read, I could feel I wasn't quite getting it. And then during rehearsal I could feel it also. I was just stiff. I just - I just wasn't ready. And I got let go. I got fired. And then five months later, I want to say, is when I did my ""Letterman"" spot. And the following year is when ""Raymond"" came.
But I was stiff in the beginning of ""Raymond,"" too. They got an acting coach for me. HBO was also one of the producers, along with Worldwide Pants. And somebody from HBO said, listen, we want to hire an acting coach for you. What do you think? And I said, all right, you know. They said, yeah because, you know, it's a little different than stand-up. When you talk, people talk back to you now. I go, oh, yeah, that's - OK, let's see how I can find out how to do that.
BIANCULLI: Ray Romano speaking to Terry Gross in 2016. SCOTT JOPLIN'S ""STOPTIME RAG"")
 2016 interview with comic, actor and writer Ray Romano. His current Netflix special, ""Ray Romano: Right Here, Around The Corner,"" is his first stand-up comedy special in 23 years. Here's a taste.
(SOUNDBITE OF COMEDY SPECIAL, ""RAY ROMANO: RIGHT HERE, AROUND THE CORNER"")
ROMANO: You know, the other day, my wife got all of us together, all the men. And she passed a new ordinance in the house, new law. She said, I'm not answering any stupid questions. She goes, from now on, if you ask me a question that you should know the answer, I'm just walking away.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: And I was like, whatever. You know, I don't want to show fear in front of my kids.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: I'm not going to show fear. I have an image for the boys. I didn't think about it. I let her go. And then the next day, I really didn't think about it till I couldn't find my sweatpants. I couldn't find my sweatpants. And I was walking up to ask her, and then I stopped myself. And I go, oh, no, is this one of those?
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: And then I thought, I can't live like this.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: And I just - I, look, I said, whatever happens, happens. I said, I can't find my sweatpants. And she looked. And she didn't say anything for a second. And then I got to admit, my heart started beating a little faster.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: And then finally she just goes, check the dryer. They're probably in the dryer. I go, OK. I walked away and went, I got away. I got away. It worked. She scared me. I got away with it. And then I thought, I can't ask her where the dryer is.
(LAUGHTER)
ROMANO: I got to find that dryer. I got to - we got the boys. You know, we all talked about it. Nobody knew. Nobody really knew. We all went in separate directions.
 What was it like for you when you first became famous? It's probably something that you wanted for yourself. But the experience of it might have been very different than what you were expecting.
ROMANO: You know, when you say famous, I guess the first time anyone ever recognized me - I was telling my wife about this the other day that I remember exactly when ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" started. I remember the first person. I was - we had gone back to Queens. It was during a hiatus weekend. I went to a gas station, and I was pumping my gas. And a woman said, hey, aren't you on that show? And I said, yeah, I am. Thank you, you know. And that was it.
And then, you know, it was still a long ways off before I ever had to worry about being somewhere - and not that I have to worry. I mean, nobody is, you know, I'm not Justin Bieber. My fans can't - I can outrun my fans. Put it that way. But yeah. But it's - I want to say strange, but it's not - it doesn't really affect my life too much really. I mean, yes, it does. I - here's what I say. Before I thought my cab driver hated me, and now I think my limo driver hates me.
GROSS: (Laughter).
ROMANO: I think it's all the same, yeah. And this is maybe a negative way to look at it, but I'm just as neurotic if I had never gotten famous or rich. I think I would be equally neurotic because I was neurotic before, and I'm neurotic now. And I'm - I think I'm just as happy as I was then.
GROSS: So a question of ""Men Of A Certain Age,"" in which you played 1 of 3 men dealing with middle age, men who'd been friends since college. And you co-created the show. So a lot of people, when they reach middle age, just try to act like they're not. You know, like, people want to seem like they're young forever, whether that means, like, getting surgery or just dressing a certain way or behaving a certain way.
And so I think it's great that you decided to, you know, write a show about men who are middle aged and really examine in both dramatic and comic way the range of some of those experiences of reaching midlife. And I'd be interested in hearing, like, why you decided to do it and to do something that had, you know, at least as much, if not more, drama in it than comedy.
ROMANO: Well, when ""Raymond"" ended, I was at first very excited - not very excited for it to end, but excited that I was going to, I guess, see what life was like. It was a bit of a cool feeling in the beginning because now you're - all of a sudden, you've got all this time. And you've got this money and this fame now. And - but it was like coming out of a submarine. It was like, what is this now? My kids are teenagers. And I live here. I live in LA.
It was kind of an odd, new feeling. I finally talked with my friend, Mike Royce, who was also a writer on ""Raymond."" And he said he's got the same feeling. And, you know, it's kind of this this weird, where am I, what am I doing now? What's, you know, where's my next passion and purpose? Am I at a part - a time in my life where I accomplished what I wanted to? And we said, let's write about it we.
That's what ""Raymond"" was. ""Raymond"" was writing about what you know. Let's do that. We're not going to do a sitcom, of course. Let's do a single camera and write about it. And that's where ""Men Of A Certain Age"" came out of. And we won a Peabody Award, and then they canceled us. And I have to give credit to TNT because they put us on the air. So I'm not blaming them, but it ultimately didn't find the right home, I don't think. We still miss it. I still miss that show. It was a passion of both of ours.
GROSS: Ray Romano, it's been great to talk with you. Thank you so much.
ROMANO: Well, I appreciate it very much. Thank you, too.

Remembering Oscar-Nominated Character Actor Seymour Cassel,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712673652/remembering-oscar-nominated-character-actor-seymour-cassel,"Cassel, who died April 7, performed as a child during matinees of his mom's burlesque shows and went on to appear in movies directed by John Cassavetes and Wes Anderson. Originally broadcast in 2006.
DAVID BIANCULLI, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, editor of the website TV Worth Watching, sitting in for Terry Gross. Actor Seymour Cassel, a character actor familiar to fans of the movies of John Cassavetes and Wes Anderson, died last Sunday at age 84. His first screen appearance was a small, uncredited role in the first film Cassavetes ever directed, in ""Shadows,"" in 1958. More than 50 years later, Cassel appeared in an episode of the HBO musical comedy series, ""Flight Of The Conchords,"" and kept working until very recently.
Terry Gross spoke with him in 2006. Overall, Cassel amassed more than 200 acting credits. His later work involved independent films, including Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" In the 1992 film ""In The Soup,"" he starred opposite Steve Buscemi. Buscemi played an aspiring writer with a massively clunky screenplay, and Cassel played the shady character willing to act as the film's finance guy.

CASSEL: (As Joe) Bobby Azaro from Queens.

CASSEL: (As Joe, laughter) Guess what?
TUCCI: (As Gregoire) What?
CASSEL: (As Joe) We just developed a mutual friend, Angelica Peena (ph).
JENNIFER BEALS: (As Angelica Pena) Pena.
CASSEL: (As Joe) Pena - what's the difference?
TUCCI: (As Gregoire) My wife?
CASSEL: (As Joe) Point is, you owe her 3,500.
TUCCI: (As Gregoire) Supposed to be 3,000 - 3,000.
BEALS: (As Angelica Pena) Three thousand.

TUCCI: (As Gregoire) We can work something out.
CASSEL: (As Joe) I'll send someone by. (Laughter) Happy New Year.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
TERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Seymour Cassel, welcome to FRESH AIR. This was kind of like your - your comeback film. Did you and Buscemi hit it off right away?
CASSEL: Yes, we did. I mean, I started in this business a long time ago. And in New York, I used to follow people down the street and imitate their walks. And so I can do Steve's walk, you know...
GROSS: (Laughter).
CASSEL: And I - and it sometimes drives people crazy, and sometimes they say, that's not the way I walk. And believe me. I'm pretty good at it. But we hit it off well. I didn't really know him or know his work. But Steve, I think I'd seen him in one or two films in some small parts. And it was a great discovery for me. He's an actor that reacts. And by that, I mean he listens, and you see him enjoying you.
GROSS: I assume that Steve Buscemi was a fan of yours before casting you. Did he already know you before meeting you? Did he already know your work...
CASSEL: He knew my work.
GROSS: ...Before meeting you in ""In The Soup.""
CASSEL: He's a big John Cassavetes fan.
GROSS: Yeah, I figured. So before we talk about your work with Cassavetes, I want to talk about your your early - and I mean very early show business career. Although, career is probably not exactly the right word. Your mother was in burlesque on the Minsky circuit when you were...
CASSEL: Yes.
GROSS: ...A child. And it sounds like you toured with her when you were...
CASSEL: I toured with her, yeah.
GROSS: ...When you were very young. What was her act like?
CASSEL: Well, she was a chorus girl. Then she became a specialty act. And if you know burlesque, Minsky had the main theater here. And he had roadshows. And you'd go from New York to Baltimore to D.C., Kansas City, Mo., St. Louis, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Buffalo, Boston. But I got to get on stage when I was about 3 1/2. And I'd do the matinees in a little checkered suit and - with the baggy pants comics. And I could only work a matinee.
And I loved that world - you know, to me, the life on a train and then coming back to New York City and - you know, and had some downtime here. And I wasn't in school yet. And when I had to go to school, I was not very happy about that.
GROSS: So your mother had a specialty act. Does that mean a specialty strip act?
CASSEL: That's right.
GROSS: So what was her specialty?
CASSEL: Oh, she - she tried dancing with the feathers for a while - you know, the big feather fans. And then she tried a balloon once. But it was just natural for me backstage, you know, chorus girls getting dressed, getting undressed. And hi, Seymour, how are you? And hi, Rosie, how are you? You know, you're just - I learned very early that this was my world. And I was going to learn how to live in it.
GROSS: Now, your mother got married when you were young to - and your stepfather won a casino in a crap game. This must have been...
CASSEL: That's not true. He said that.
GROSS: That's not - I keep reading this every place. So what...
CASSEL: Well, it's true...
GROSS: What happened?
CASSEL: ...That's what I was told. I was 9. And I was living in - on 42nd with his mother and sister. He was a master sergeant in the Air Force during World War II, I guess. He'd been in 17 1/2 years. And we lived down in Fort Myers, Fla. We lived in Miami Beach. I remember the end of the war riding in a car with him and him saying, remember this day. A great man died today. And that was Franklin Roosevelt. And then, you know, we lived in Birmingham, Ala. And then the next thing I know, they were going to Panama.
And that's what he told me, that he won it in a crap game. I later figured out, I got a feeling that he did a little business with some guys in Brooklyn and in the Bronx, you know. I mean, where else would - because we lived in a club - we had the whole corner on Ancon in Panama City. Ancon is the first little town in the Canal Zone. And he also had card games for the officers from the Canal Zone. So he was - he was a busy guy. And I'm not sure what he did, but I'm sure some of it was a little illegal. But he made it work.
GROSS: So you were - you were - you were a pretty streetwise kid.
CASSEL: Oh, totally. And I'm still a streetwise guy. I mean, when people start to talk trash with me, I say, you don't know I've been there. Snoop Dogg, I did a movie with him. And he started with me. And he said, where'd you learn that? And I said, well, between 42nd Street and New York, Snoop, I was doing no good and rapping before you ever started.
GROSS: Cassavetes has been such an influence on independent filmmaking. I mean, he's probably one of the most influential filmmakers in the world of independent film. And he was improvising in movies before that became a popular thing to do. What was his approach to getting the actors to improvise a scene? What were you given before the scene, and how would you work it?
CASSEL: Well, John, with ""Shadows"" we would do an improvisation. And John would see where the actors' tendencies and their instincts would take them. Then he would write, you know. But with ""Shadows,"" we would just rehearse it again and again and improvise it again and do it.
Once he started writing and wrote ""Too Late Blues"" and wrote ""Faces,"" you know, there was very - actually, the only improvisation in ""Faces"" is the songs I make up with the girls in - that I pick up at the Whiskey A Go Go, you know, where I say, put on the red meat, mama, don't want no taters, no onions - because we had no money for music. So John knew that I could kind of make up songs. I'd been doing it, you know, in the late '50s.
But when you get to know an actor and, you know, their instincts as well as John knew mine and Gazzara and, you know, and Gena, he could lead you. You can always add something to a scene because your instincts are to embellish it somewhat to contribute to the text. And ideas come to you, and you try them. And if they're good, you keep them. If they're not, you just eliminate them.
GROSS: You had a pretty major part in ""Faces."" You don't come into the film until around two-thirds of the way in. But then it's a pretty important part. ""Faces"" is about - it's basically about a middle-aged, middle-class, very unhappy couple.
So the husband in the couple goes off with Gena Rowlands, who plays a prostitute in it. And his wife goes to the Whiskey A Go Go with her girlfriends. They pick you you up or you pick them up. And you end up going to bed with the wife of this unhappy couple. And she's so miserable by the time, you know, later on about, like, what her life has become that she tries to overdose on sleeping pills.
CASSEL: Yes.
GROSS: And then you try to revive her.
CASSEL: I do revive her.
GROSS: Successfully.
CASSEL: Yes.
GROSS: And then I want to play the scene that happens right after that, after you've stuck your fingers down her throat to revive her...
CASSEL: Yeah.
GROSS: ...And kind of slapped...
CASSEL: To make her throw up, yeah.
GROSS: ...Her awake. You're talking with her, and here's part of that scene.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""FACES"")
CASSEL: (As Chet) I like you. I caused you a lot of pain and a lot of grief, and I almost killed you. And I prayed, man, oh, I prayed to God. God, please, dear God, don't let anything happen to her 'cause I love her so much, and I'll do anything you say, God. And, man, I don't even believe in him, you know? But, I mean, it doesn't matter. We protect ourselves. So when you're taught ethics and values and honesty and I'm a nice guy and you're a nice guy and this and that, you know, I mean, it just doesn't matter. Nobody cares. Nobody has the time to be vulnerable to each other, so we just go on. You know, I mean, right away our armor comes out like a shield and goes around us, and we become like mechanical men. (Laughing) And I called you a mechanical woman. All you got to do is, I'm so mechanical. Honey, it's absolutely ludicrous how mechanical a person can be. (Imitating robot) I am the sexiest guy in the world. (Imitating robot) I have blond hair. (Imitating robot) I can get all the women I want. (Laughing) You're waking up, aren't you?
LYNN CARLIN: (As Maria, laughing) Uh-huh.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
GROSS: That's Seymour Cassel in a scene from John Cassavetes' movie ""Faces."" Seymour Cassel, tell us a little bit about making that scene.
CASSEL: We were shooting it, and John - as I say to her the dialogue, you know, you think you're mechanical, honey. I'm so mechanical. Look, and I smoke a cigarette mechanically. And John said to me off camera, do the - do a mechanical man. So I did that (imitating robot) you know, kind of a - look at this, honey. And but that's the relationship you have with a director that knows you, that trusts you, that you respect. And you will try anything for him because you know he won't let you look foolish.
BIANCULLI: Seymour Cassel speaking to Terry Gross in 2006. He died last Sunday at age 84. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to Terry's 2006 interview with character actor Seymour Cassel. He first became noticed for his roles in films by John Cassavetes. He died last Sunday at age 84.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
GROSS: There's so many, like, myths and legends about, you know, the Cassavetes movies and the people who made them and their adventures together making movies and their adventures together off the set. The impression I always get is that there's a lot of, like, partying and drinking that everybody making the movies did together.
CASSEL: Well, in the '50s, that's what people did. Dope wasn't around. Only up in Harlem could you get a nickel - a matchbox of marijuana. But - so we drank, and it was a social - socially accepted. And people drank highballs and cocktails, and every bar had a piano bar with a pianist who sang and, you know, and entertained.
And then there were joints like Jilly's that Sinatra hung out at and made famous. But there was the Five Spot and Basin Street and, you know, Birdland. And then, you know, 52nd street, I mean, you could stand outside at 16 years old and hear Billie Holiday sing because they always had the door open in the summer. And then, you know - all those clubs.
GROSS: Did any of the partying and drinking interfere with the moviemaking?
CASSEL: No. No. If you got too drunk, we - you know, we would wrap. But, I mean, we didn't drink that much when we worked. We would wait till afterward. John had a basketball court built on his house on Woodrow Wilson. And we'd finished shooting the older actors - Marley, you know, and Dorothy Gulliver.
And some would tire maybe around 3:30 in the morning, at 3. And we'd go out there, put the lights on, you know, take a couple of six-packs of beer and play basketball and beat the hell out of each other. It didn't bother anybody because Frank Zappa lived right next door, and he had a recording studio there. So who the hell were we bothering?
GROSS: John Cassavetes died in '89 of cirrhosis of the liver. What impact did that have on you? Were you still close then?
CASSEL: That - it still has an impact on me. I think of him almost every day. I mean, it was the older brother I never had, and it was the closest male friend that I ever had. And he was extremely influential in how - in creating my career and guiding it and - by loving me as much as he does or did. Yeah, that was the closest person in my life ever 'cause I never knew my father. And my mother, I only knew until I was about 12, and I went back to live with my godmother.
So John became a really - very close person in my life. And we were like - he had lost a brother - excuse me - very young before I met him of a heart attack and misdiagnosed and - so to me, it was the older brother I never had. And I don't know what I was to him, but I know that he loved me. And I love him very much. I mean...
GROSS: Now, I understand that you gave up drinking after he died.
CASSEL: I did. Well, I did it just - when I saw how bad he was, I quit. I quit everything. It was 20 something years ago. But...
GROSS: Your comeback wasn't long after that. Were the two connected?
CASSEL: Well, probably - people were less fearful of me because I was crazy. I mean, people would have one foot in Dan Tana's in LA and one foot inside the door and one out. What's Seymour going to do now? I got to see it, but I don't want to be here when he does it. I mean, I...
GROSS: What were you doing? What were you doing...
CASSEL: Anything I wanted. I was - you know, when I would get a little drunk, I would just be funny and stupid. And that's what people do when they - they either get stupid and mean, or they get funny and stupid. I chose to be funny. Mean was not something I liked to be.
GROSS: So you gave up drinking, and...
CASSEL: Yes.
GROSS: ...That's when you started to make your comeback. You said people were afraid to work with you before that.
CASSEL: I was unpredictable.
GROSS: And I think it was largely, like, independent filmmakers that you made your comeback with. You know, your first film was ""In The Soup"" that co-starred Steve Buscemi. Wes Anderson, for example, has cast you in three movies - ""Rushmore""...
CASSEL: ""Rushmore.""
GROSS: ...""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou."" How did he first approach you?
CASSEL: He was at Sundance when we won - he had a short called ""Bottle Rocket."" And what impressed me most was his knowledge of film. And I liked the script, and I liked the part. And so after that, he insisted I be in ""The Royal Tenenbaums.""
I didn't want to do ""Life Aquatic."" I was doing another movie. He said, you got to be in this movie. You got to be. And I had to fly to Rome. And then he looks at me, and he said, can we shave your head? I said, Wes, who the hell do you think you are? I'm shooting another movie.
GROSS: (Laughter).
CASSEL: I have already established my hair. He says, well, you could wear a wig. I said, for Christ sake, Wes, you're not the only filmmaker in the world, you know? I'm - why don't I wear a wig here? He said, well, no, the character has to be bald. I said, then do the skullcap. And that was miserable. It's 2 1/2 to 3 hours to put that on.
GROSS: Your new movie ""Lonesome Jim"" - you play the father in a nuclear family - husband, wife, two sons. And I'm thinking that must be very exotic to you, in a way, because you never really had that kind of nuclear family. Well, I guess maybe you had it as an adult, but you certainly didn't have it as a boy. Does the idea of, like, a real nuclear family seem somewhat exotic to you?
CASSEL: Well, it - I thought being as crazy as I was and knowing that very early - I was my own source of entertainment. When I had my own family - and I still do it with my grandchildren - I created the craziness that my kids grew up around in LA - The Rolling Stones, you know, and Jimi Hendrix and Cassavetes and all this. And their father was a bit crazy, but he loved them very much because it was what I never had. And I was grateful to have it.
Playing a straight family and a guy like that - people suppress themselves, and they get comfortable with a specific way of life. And they don't take chances anymore. And I've - I just knew from 3, 4, 5, 6 years old that life is a chance, and everything you do in it is. And, you know, I wasn't going to climb up the side of a tenement until I was sure I could make it.
You know, and then we'd go up that brick that sticks out on the edge of a - on 42nd Street - on those buildings. We'd go up to the roof. There were only about three of us that could do that when I was, you know, 8. And a new kid would move in, and we'd, you know, say, hey, can you climb? Yes. Come on. Try - he'd get stuck a floor and a half up, and we got to call the firetrucks to come and rescue him, you know? But, I mean, that's - that was kids here. So I was always an adventurer, you know?
And to play this character that I played in ""Lonesome Jim"" - to play Don - I met the guy, and I met his wife. And to play someone like that - it was tough for me to be that quiet, you know? And I understood who he was. And it's just the safe way, and I've never done anything safe.
GROSS: Well, Seymour Cassel, thank you so much.
CASSEL: Thank you.

Israeli Election Results: Will Netanyahu Shift Further Right? : NPR,www.npr.org,Larry Kaplow,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/711987101/analysis-does-netanyahus-win-maintain-status-quo-or-push-israel-further-right,"Embed Embed Transcript
A decade under Netanyahu has seen the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict become more remote. Religious Jewish lawmakers hold more sway over law and society as they block initiatives to expand LGBT rights and allow for secular marriage ceremonies. And democracy has been put to the test with a new law that could weaken the standing of non-Jewish citizens and Netanyahu himself saying the country is the nation state ""not of all its citizens, but only the Jewish people.""
Now the question is, what Netanyahu will do with his new term? Here's what to watch.
Coalition building
It's a little in the weeds, but the process for putting together a government in Israel can lead a prime minister as much as the prime minister might try to lead the process. To be prime minister, you have to put together a majority coalition with at least 61 seats in the 120-seat parliament.
Netanyahu's strength doesn't come from getting many more votes than his main challenger, retired Gen. Benny Gantz. The Likud has 36 seats while Gantz's party has 35. (The Labor Party, once Israel's center-left powerhouse of Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, dropped to six seats.) After A Decade Of Netanyahu, Hopes Fade For A Palestinian State
But the bulk of the remaining field comprises ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and nationalist parties that want to expand Israeli settlements in occupied West Bank territory, home to 2.8 million Palestinians.
Netanyahu will likely have a few weeks to put together this coalition. Centrist leaders have vowed not to join his government (and Netanyahu hasn't offered). So he's looking to the right-wing parties in his outgoing government and he'll have to give their leaders cabinet ministries and assure them he will look out for their issues.
Moves against Palestinian statehood
When Netanyahu wanted to close his deal with voters last weekend, he reached out to the right, not the center. He said he would annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank — land Israel captured in 1967. This would firm up Israel's unilateral hold on them and dig the country into a position that could preclude any Palestinian state.
We'll see soon how serious this is. President Trump has vowed to propose a peace plan in the coming weeks or months and he says it will require both sides to make concessions.
Palestinians say the United States is far too biased in favor of Israel and they have refused to work with Trump's peace team since the U.S. backed Israel's claim to the city of Jerusalem and moved the U.S. Embassy there. Opinion: Trump's Recognition Of Israel's Claim To Golan Only Creates New Problems
David Makovsky, director of the Project on Arab-Israel Relations at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told NPR Netanyahu would likely hold off on annexation as a favor to Trump, pending the peace proposal. But if the Palestinians are seen as rejecting the plan, he says, Netanyahu would seek a green light from Trump for annexation of select settlements as a ""consequence.""
Israel might just annex small areas at first, but that would be enough to be ""breaking that taboo,"" Makovsky said.
Israel would likely point to the divided Palestinian leadership and accuse them of scuttling Trump's plan. But annexation would draw a big outcry from the Palestinians and governments around the world, which hold that the West Bank should be resolved by peace talks.
The pending charges
Israel's attorney general has signaled that he's preparing to file corruption charges against Netanyahu. Under their system, Netanyahu's lawyers can get a hearing to try to prevent that — which could take place this summer.
An indictment could also push Netanyahu to the right. The indictment itself doesn't force him from office, but Netanyahu will need to keep his coalition or may even ask his allies to pass laws allowing him to delay the case while in office. They'll ask for things in return, like maybe the annexation of West Bank settlements.
Netanyahu will be under major pressure to give in to their demands. His expected government would only have a narrow parliamentary majority and defectors could prompt a new election.
When Gantz and his party conceded the election this week, they said they would fight Netanyahu in parliament and, one party leader said, ""in 2020.""
The Iran threat
Throughout the last decade, Netanyahu has focused on Iran and its nuclear program as Israel's biggest threat.
He helped talk Trump into pulling the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal. Most analysts and even Trump administration officials say Iran is abiding by the terms of the deal — which offered sanctions relief in exchange for limits on Iran's nuclear program. But Trump and Netanyahu say the deal isn't tough enough and Netanyahu says Iran is secretly planning to work on nuclear weapons despite the deal.
""He feels he has some unfinished business on a matter of great importance to Israel's national security, maybe even sees it as kind of his destiny,"" former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Daniel Shapiro told NPR. He says Netanyahu might see the next two years, while Trump's in office, as a chance to strike a ""definitive blow that would end the Iran nuclear program."" He says that it might not be a military blow — but could be.
The Trump effect
Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were in office during previous Netanyahu terms as prime minister and they tried to rein in his hard-line tendencies. Knowing that Israelis value their country's relations with the U.S., Netanyahu had to listen.
Trump nearly always backs Netanyahu and has given him a series of wins: Moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights, taking tough steps against Iran. Netanyahu's campaign featured photos of him and the president — just as Trump's will likely do.
But Netanyahu could restrain himself from taking radical moves on the big issues he faces. For all his rhetoric and his move to the right, he generally avoids making moves where he can't be confident of the outcome. When making war — like against Hamas in Gaza — he does so where he knows Israel will face little cost.
""He's been more of a status quo-maintenance politician for many years, now faced with some momentous decisions,"" Shapiro said.

'New York Post' Criticized For 9/11 Photo Paired With Ilhan Omar Quote : NPR,www.npr.org,Sasha Ingber,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712643034/new-york-post-denounced-for-publishing-sept-11-photo-with-rep-ilhan-omar-words,"Enlarge this image Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., attends a Youth Climate Strike on March 15 in Washington. On Thursday, the New York Post drew criticism after featuring a partial Quote: by Omar with an image from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Tom Brenner/Getty Images Tom Brenner/Getty Images Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., attends a Youth Climate Strike on March 15 in Washington. On Thursday, the New York Post drew criticism after featuring a partial Quote: by Omar with an image from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Tom Brenner/Getty Images The New York Post is facing a barrage of criticism after its cover on Thursday featured an image of the World Trade Center, burning in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, below a terse Quote: by one of the first Muslim women serving in Congress.
""Rep. Ilhan Omar: 9/11 was 'Some people did something,' "" the cover read . A caption underneath added, ""Here's your something ... 2,977 people dead by terrorism.""
The Quote: came from a speech Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., gave last month. She was speaking at a banquet hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, discussing how terrorism has led to a rise in Islamophobia.
National Minnesota Congresswoman Ignites Debate On Israel And Anti-Semitism ""Far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,"" she told the crowd. ""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties."" (The Sept. 11 attacks occurred in 2001. CAIR was was founded in 1994.)
Days after the banquet, critics zeroed in on her description of the terrorist attacks, inciting outrage that bore resemblance to the condemnation she received after making remarks about Israel .
On Fox & Friends , co-host Brian Kilmeade told viewers, ""You have to wonder if [Omar] is an American first.""
""This woman is a disgrace,"" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted .
This is ugly pic.twitter.com/R2XVyS4dq8
— Harry Siegel (@harrysiegel) April 11, 2019 Rep. Dan Crenshaw , R-Texas, a former Navy SEAL who lost an eye in a bombing in Afghanistan, said it was ""unbelievable."" ""You described an act of terrorism on American soil that killed thousands of innocent lives as 'some people did something.' It's still unbelievable,"" he later wrote on Twitter .
Rep. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., and assistant speaker in the House, told MSNBC , ""Those statements were not only hurtful to me, but extremely hurtful to everyone that was personally impacted by those terrorist attacks.""
But the Post 's incendiary cover, released at a time when owner Rupert Murdoch and Fox have come under intense scrutiny , has made it the target of a different strain of anger.
""Their intention was to be inflammatory, to generate sales at the expense of dividing our country,"" Hassan Shibly, head of CAIR's Florida chapter, tells NPR.
""Far too many people have tried to blame, even retaliate, against Muslim communities when we are victims of that attack just like all Americans,"" Shibly says.
Omar continues to receive death threats, he says. ""Obviously the first hijab-wearing, American Muslim woman [in Congress] is going to be the first target,"" he says. ""People's deep-seated hatred for the Muslim community is now being projected onto her.""
Joseph Azam, one of Murdoch's former top executives, described the newspaper cover as ""the virulent anti-Muslim bigotry being put out by various parts of the Murdoch empire."" Azam recently told NPR he left his post because he was sickened by the coverage of Muslims, race and immigration in Murdoch's outlets. ""They are going to get ppl killed - is that the goal?"" Azam tweeted Thursday.
House colleagues came to Omar's aid. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., tweeted, ""The NY Post knows exactly what it's doing - taking Quote: s out of context and evoking painful imagery to spread hate and endangering the life of Rep. Omar. Shame on them, and shame on Rupert Murdoch.""
Media Former Murdoch Executive Says He Quit Over Fox's Anti-Muslim Rhetoric Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,‏ D-N.Y., called the cover ""horrifying"" and ""hateful,"" before adding that Omar co-sponsored the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. She told reporters that the wrath against Omar was ""not a normal level of political debate or rhetoric.""
The New York Post did not immediately respond to NPR's requests for comment.
On Friday, Omar herself Quote: d words uttered in the wake of Sept. 11 by former President George W. Bush, adding, ""Was Bush downplaying the terrorist attack?""
The newspaper cover wasn't the first time Omar was linked to the Sept. 11 attacks. A poster at a winter event sponsored by the Republican Party of West Virginia showed a photo of the congresswoman, wearing a hijab, beneath a photo of the twin towers engulfed by flames.
National Sign Falsely Linking Muslim Congresswoman To Sept. 11 Sparks Outrage In West Virginia A group called ACT for America, which had set up a table near that poster, describes itself as a national security organization and is labeled as an anti-Muslim hate group, promoted the Post cover on Twitter. It called Omar's rhetoric ""dangerous.""
According to a 2018 Pew Research Center estimate , Muslims made up about 3.45 million people in the United States in 2017, slightly more than 1 percent of the total population."

Now in its 19th year, the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is more than a music festival, or even a lifestyle. It's a capital-M moment that seems to stop the world. (And not entirely because Beyoncé willed it so last year.) Beyond the experience of bearing witness to celebrities of the A- and D-lists as they drench themselves in sweat and dust while gorging on trendy cuisine and novelty cocktails, Coachella's influence extends far beyond the festival grounds of Indio, California.
Even Coachella seems to be aware of this: For the first time ever, it's doubling down on its festival streams by showcasing both weekends of the festival. Emergent K-pop group BLACKPINK is set to broadcast its message of sensory-overload pop music in Times Square this weekend. Childish Gambino and Rihanna premiered a new film, and with the aid of Amazon and YouTube, will premiere it globally this weekend for free.
For those looking to avoid the hefty price tag of a festival pass — or reluctant to experience Coachella anywhere but on a couch — we've got you covered. The only catch: You'll need to watch it live on YouTube , as Coachella does not make its sets available after the fact as on-demand videos.
So, without further ado, here are 10 Coachella 2019 acts worth planning your weekend around, in chronological order. And if you're the adventurous sort, you can scan and skip between a whopping 83 live performances across three channels at youtube.com/user/coachella/coachellalive . 10 Coachella Sets We're Watching This Weekend Kacey Musgraves Jason Kempin/Getty Images for for Essential B Jason Kempin/Getty Images for for Essential B

"American Businesses Stayed Quiet On Chinese Hackers, Amid Concerns For Profits : NPR",www.npr.org,Laura Sullivan,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/711779130/as-china-hacked-u-s-businesses-turned-a-blind-eye,"Enlarge this image Top government leaders told NPR that federal agencies are years behind where they could have been if Chinese cybertheft had been openly addressed earlier. Bill Hinton Photography/Getty Images Bill Hinton Photography/Getty Images Top government leaders told NPR that federal agencies are years behind where they could have been if Chinese cybertheft had been openly addressed earlier.
Bill Hinton Photography/Getty Images Technology theft and other unfair business practices originating from China are costing the American economy more than $57 billion a year, White House officials believe, and they expect that figure to grow.
Yet an investigation by NPR and the PBS television show Frontline into why three successive administrations failed to stop cyberhacking from China found an unlikely obstacle for the government — the victims themselves.
About This Story This story is part of a joint investigation with the PBS series Frontline , which includes an upcoming documentary, Trump's Trade War , scheduled to air May 7, 2019, on PBS.
In dozens of interviews with U.S. government and business representatives, officials involved in commerce with China said hacking and theft were an open secret for almost two decades, allowed to quietly continue because U.S. companies had too much money at stake to make waves.
Wendy Cutler, who was a veteran negotiator at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, says it wasn't just that U.S. businesses were hesitant to come forward in specific cases. She says businesses didn't want the trade office to take ""any strong action.""
""We are not as effective if we don't have the U.S. business community supporting us,"" she says. ""Looking back on it, in retrospect, I think we probably should have been more active and more responsive. We kind of lost the big picture of what was really happening.""
None of the dozens of companies or organizations that NPR reached out to that have been victims of theft or corporate espionage originating from China would go on the record.
And for its part, the Chinese government officially denied to NPR and Frontline that it has been involved in such practices.

Here she delivers a 2015 speech at the Asia Society in Hong Kong.
Bruce Yan/South China Morning Post via Getty Images But that's not what former U.S. Attorney David Hickton found. When he took over in the Western District of Pennsylvania in 2010, he says, he was inundated with calls from companies saying they suspected China might be inside their computer systems.
""I literally received an avalanche of concern and complaints from companies and organizations who said, 'We are losing our technology — drip, drip, drip,' "" he says.
Hickton opened an investigation and quickly set his sights on a special unit of the Chinese military — a secretive group known as Unit 61398. Investigators were able to watch as the unit's officers, sitting in an office building in Shanghai, broke into the computer systems of American companies at night, stopped for an hour break at China's lunchtime and then continued in the Chinese afternoon.
""They were really using a large rake — think of a rake [like] you rake leaves in the fall,"" he says. ""They were taking everything ... personal information, strategic plans, organizational charts. Then they just figured out later how they were going to use it.""
But when Hickton went to the companies, eager for them to become plaintiffs, he ran into a problem. None of the companies wanted any part of it. Hickton says they had too much money on the line in China.
""What we were tone-deaf to is [that] we seemed to think we could just walk in and wave the flag of the USA,"" Hickton says, ""and it just didn't work.""
Even today, five years later, Hickton still won't name most of the companies involved — and they have never come forward.
Eventually he was able to convince five largely local companies and the steelworkers union to come forward, mostly, he says, because he grew up in Pittsburgh and went to school with a lot of the managers.

Alex Wong/Getty Images ""I knew these people,"" Hickton says. ""They trusted me. ... We couldn't ask them to be patriotic at the expense of engendering a shareholder case.""
But, he says, he could have included hundreds — or even thousands — more.
""We've made a terrible mistake by being so secretive about our cyberwork,"" he says. ""We have not fairly told the people we represent what the threats are.""
Government and business leaders interviewed by NPR and Frontline said individual companies were making millions of dollars in China over the past decade and a half and didn't want to hurt short-term profits by coming forward. They demanded secrecy, even in the face of outright theft.
But now the impact of that secrecy is coming to light, they say. Companies are facing hundreds of millions of dollars in future losses from the theft, and U.S. officials say they are years behind trying to tackle the problem.
Michael Wessel, commissioner on the U.S. government's U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, says it wasn't supposed to be this way. U.S. officials had high hopes when China officially joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.
""There was a honeymoon period in the first six or seven years, a desire to try [to] make things work,"" Wessel says.
But, he says, starting around 2006, businesses began coming to him saying that China had stolen their designs or ideas or had pressured them into partnerships and taken their technology.
National Security Charges Against Chinese Hackers Are Now Common. Why Don't They Deter Cyberattacks? National Security In China's Push For High-Tech, Hackers Target Cutting-Edge U.S. Firms National Security Justice Department Charges Chinese Hackers In Bid To Curtail Cyber-Theft Just like with Hickton, Wessel says, they wouldn't come forward publicly.
""The business community wanted the administration to come in hard without anyone's fingerprints being on the reasoning behind it,"" he says. ""They wanted the profits, but they also didn't want the possible retribution.""
Wessel says that was never going to work. While nothing in the original trade agreements specifically mentions cybertheft, the U.S. could have brought criminal cases forward, enacted sanctions or opened investigations under rules set up by the World Trade Organization — if a company would let it.
Court cases and documents from recent years offer a clue into what experts believe has really been going on. The Chinese government has been accused of stealing everything from vacuum cleaner designs to solar panel technology to the blueprints of Boeing's C-17 aircraft.
Hackers from China, often with ties to the government, have been accused of breaking into gas companies, steel companies and chemical companies. Not long ago, Chinese government companies were indicted for stealing the secret chemical makeup of the color white from DuPont. China developed its J-20 fighter plane, a plane similar to Lockheed Martin's F-22 Raptor, shortly after a Chinese national was indicted for stealing technical data from Lockheed Martin, including the plans for the Raptor.
Chinese hacking made occasional headlines, but none really grabbed Americans' attention. There was one exception.
In 2010, Google went public in announcing that it had been hacked by the Chinese government. Thirty-four other American companies that were also part of the hack stayed silent. Most have kept it a secret to this day.

The tech giant's accusation that year that it had been hacked by China cast light on a problem few companies discuss: the pervasive threat from Chinese-based cybertheft.
Vincent Thian/AP NPR tracked down 11 of the total 35 companies. All of them either did not respond to NPR's request or declined to comment.
A former top Google official who was closely involved in managing the hack told NPR that Google was ""infuriated"" that no other company would come forward, leaving Google to challenge China alone.
""[We] wanted to out all of the companies by name,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition their name not be used because they did not have permission from Google to speak about the incident. ""One of the companies we called, said 'Oh, yeah, we've been tracking this for months.' It was unbelievable. The legal department talked us out of it.""
""We felt like we stood up and did the right thing,"" the former official said. ""It felt like Helm's Deep, the battle from The Lord of the Rings in which you're impossibly surrounded and severely outnumbered.""
They just all hid under a rock and pretended it didn't happen.
James McGregor, a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, on U.S. businesses reacting to Chinese hacking
James McGregor, a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, who was there at the time, says the companies kept even business organizations like his from speaking out.
""What they should have done is held a press conference and say, 'We 35 businesses have been hacked,' and you would have put it right back on China,"" says McGregor. ""Instead, they just all hid under a rock and pretended it didn't happen.""
McGregor says their silence left little room for punishment, and worse, he says, it hid the extent of the problem.
Across the ocean, cybersleuth Dmitri Alperovitch was sitting at his desk at a security company in Atlanta when Google called looking for backup. He says when he took a look, he was stunned.
""I knew pretty much right away this is something very different,"" says Alperovitch, who is co-founder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. ""For the first time we were facing a nation-state and intelligence service that was breaking into companies — not governments, not militaries, but private sector organizations.""
But, he says, U.S. government officials were nowhere to be seen.
""They did not even publicly concur with the attributions that Google had made at the time,"" he says.

Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, said he was stunned after Google announced it was hacked by China. Here he speaks during the Milken Institute Global Conference in California on May 1, 2017.
Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images Obama administration officials say they did not turn a blind eye to the Google hack or cybertheft from China.
The administration was struggling with other important priorities, such as North Korea, Iran, the economy and climate change, says Evan Medeiros, Obama's top China specialist and then a staffer at the National Security Council.
""Direct confrontation with China does not usually result in lasting solutions,"" Medeiros says, noting that President Obama secured an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping to halt the attacks and put together a regional trade agreement — the Trans-Pacific Partnership — to add pressure.
But neither measure lasted.
""Hindsight is always 20/20,"" he says. ""I wish that we had spent more time ... finding creative ways to punish them for creating a nonlevel playing field.""
Without those punishments, the attacks continued.
In the year after the Google hack, Alperovitch uncovered two more serious intrusions that, he says, involved thousands of American companies.
In the fall of 2011, he went to the White House to warn officials about what he had found. He sat down in the Situation Room with a half-dozen top administration leaders.
""The most surprising thing to me was the lack of surprise,"" Alperovitch says. ""I got the distinct impression that none of this was news. When I pressed them on why they were not taking stronger action against China, their response was, 'We have a multifaceted relationship with China.' ""

During the visit, the two leaders announced an agreement to halt cyberattacks.
Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images Alperovitch says White House officials told him that some of the same companies that were being victimized by China also wanted to continue doing business in China.
""They didn't want to take any action that would jeopardize that billions of dollars of trade we were doing at the time,"" he says.
Ask McGregor, the American business representative, how companies can complain about China's behavior to the U.S. government while simultaneously preventing the government from taking strong action, and his answer is blunt.
""Companies were afraid of China,"" he says. ""American business companies' incentives are to make money.""
McGregor today advises dozens of American companies in China, and he says they are confronting a new reality. China is no longer an up-and-comer — it's a true competitor and quickly closing in on America's high-tech sector. McGregor says company leaders are beginning to ask whether years of theft and hacking have given China an edge that the United States will no longer be able to stay in front of.
And U.S. government officials are asking whether federal agencies will be able to catch up on enforcement.
Top government leaders told NPR that federal agencies are years behind where they could have been if the theft had been openly addressed.
Even at the Defense Department, as late as 2014, cybertheft from China was not one of the Pentagon's top priorities.
""Our intelligence agencies were looking at the Middle East, at the Russians,"" says Air Force Brig. Gen. Robert Spalding, a China expert who worked for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Council.
He says he had never given the issue of Chinese cybertheft much thought. But then, in the fall of 2014, he loaded a confidential briefing into his computer. It was case after case in which the Chinese government had stolen the product designs from almost a dozen high-tech American companies, in a couple of cases almost putting them out of business.
""It immediately changed my conception, my view of the world,"" he says. ""I realized I did not know how the world worked.""

Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images Spalding says he made it his mission to get the word out to other government agencies. But even in 2015, he says, he was met mostly with a shrug.
He says he went to the departments of Commerce and the Treasury, as well as the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. State Department.
""The two responses we got were, 'Oh my gosh, this is really, really bad.' And the second one is, 'That's not my job,'"" Spalding says. ""That was almost the universal answer we got every time we went to a senior leader. Bad problem but not my problem.""
Spalding, who retired from the Air Force last year, says in the final years under Obama and now under President Trump, agencies are finally starting to take some action. The Justice Department is bringing criminal cases, the trade representative's office is investigating China's dealings and both administrations have brought concerns to the Chinese directly.
But, Spalding says, it may have come 10 years too late.
""We all missed it,"" he says. ""We have to understand the problem and get to work on it."""
Power In The White House Is Growing With Acting Agency And Cabinet Department Heads : NPR,www.npr.org,Kelsey Snell,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862452/power-in-the-white-house-is-growing-with-acting-agency-and-cabinet-department-he,"Power In The White House Is Growing With Acting Agency And Cabinet Department Heads Power In The White House Is Growing With Acting Agency And Cabinet Department Heads Embed Embed
With so many acting cabinet secretaries who do not need Senate confirmation many Republican Senators are concerned the Trump administration is weakening their advice and consent Constitutional role.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The Senate's vote this week to confirm former oil lobbyist David Bernhardt for interior secretary means there's one less temp in President Trump's cabinet. It brings the number of acting heads of agencies and Cabinet departments from 13 to 12. More than any other president, Trump has used short-term appointments to keep the government running. NPR's Kelsey Snell reports that all that churn means the power in the White House is growing as the checks and balances of the Senate start to vanish.
KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: The Constitution is pretty clear about how the top jobs in federal government are supposed to be filled. It's right there in Article II, Section 2. The president shall nominate, and the Senate shall give advice and consent. Senator Lamar Alexander says it's a critical job with real consequences.
LAMAR ALEXANDER: But when it breaks down, we actually give the president more power because he can appoint all these acting people and ignore the United States Senate, which is just the reverse of what the founders intended.
SNELL: But the Tennessee Republican says that's not what's happening right now. Acting heads are running departments like Homeland Security and Defense and agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. And President Trump told CBS earlier this year that all that instability is by design.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I like acting because I can move so quickly. It gives me more flexibility.
SNELL: Trump may like it, but that's not what the Constitution intended.
ALEXANDER: Because our founders didn't want a king - so they said, we're not going to let the president have all the power.
SNELL: Unease over the instability within the Trump administration has spread in recent months as the number of vacancies and acting heads expanded. There's almost universal agreement among senators that there is a real risk in letting the standards slip too far, but there's not a lot of agreement about who's to blame or how to stop it. Louisiana Senator John Kennedy points to Democrats.
JOHN KENNEDY: I believe that at least part of the White House's thinking is that we could send over Alexander Hamilton, and the Democrats would object.
SNELL: He says Trump was forced to get creative. In many cases, the law gives presidents some latitude to use temps to fill in while a permanent replacement is confirmed. And Kennedy says it's only logical for the White House to use that wiggle room to get around some political roadblocks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says it's not just that. The Senate is doing its best to keep up with other nominees, including his pledge to fill a sea of federal court vacancies with Trump's conservative appointees.
MITCH MCCONNELL: I've got my hands full just trying to clean up the executive calendar we already have.
SNELL: McConnell downplayed the loss of power that happens when the Senate no longer has a responsibility to publicly vet and approve a nominee. He says when Trump finds a permanent agency head, the Senate will do its job.
MCCONNELL: I don't have any advice to give to the president about nominations, but I got - we got plenty of them to work on already. And if he sends up a nominee for an important position, like Cabinet post, it'll go to the front of the line. And we'll process it as early as we can.
SNELL: Florida Republican Marco Rubio has a different view. He has watched the agencies change in recent years. He says the partisan fights over nominees have been damaging to the entire process, but the lack of permanent bosses is causing serious problems.
MARCO RUBIO: I didn't used to believe that, but I've seen that when you're in an acting role, it's very different than when you're confirmed by the Senate, just in terms of the respect you command and even your control over the agency and the individuals underneath you.
SNELL: Texas Senator John Cornyn agrees with Rubio. Agency heads should be publicly vetted. They should have to be approved, and they should be there permanently.
JOHN CORNYN: It's not ideal, but it is certainly within the law.
SNELL: For all of their frustration, there's not much senators can do to exercise their constitutional power until Trump gives them permanent nominees to vote on. Kelsey Snell, NPR News, the Capitol.

On children's book author Beverly Cleary's 103rd birthday, the story of how she became a writer.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
We want to take a moment now to wish happy birthday to a woman many of us grew up on. Children's book author Beverly Cleary turns 103 today, which gives us an excuse to celebrate her.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Yes. Ramona Quimby, Beezus, ""The Mouse And The Motorcycle"" - vroom-vroom.
SHAPIRO: Cleary's books have sold more than 90 million copies. As she told Oregon Public Broadcasting, she wasn't always a big reader.
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""DISCOVERING BEVERLY CLEARY"")
BEVERLY CLEARY: Oh, I remember a moment of terror in the first grade when we were in a reading circle. And I'd figured ahead what word I was going to have to read. And it was city. And I knew it wasn't pronounced kitty, but I couldn't remember.
CHANG: About two years later, she was browsing through a book when something happened.
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""DISCOVERING BEVERLY CLEARY"")
CLEARY: I was really just looking at the pictures and discovered I was reading it and enjoying what I read. It was quite a revelation.
CHANG: She started reading more and writing stories, too. The school librarian suggested she become an author.
SHAPIRO: She grew up, went to college and became a children's librarian in Yakima, Wash. She learned to write for children there, standing up in front of big groups and telling them stories.
CHANG: A few years later, she was ready to write books of her own.
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""DISCOVERING BEVERLY CLEARY"")
CLEARY: And I waited and waited, and no ideas came. And I thought about the little boy in the Yakima Public Library who (laughter) faced me rather ferociously once and said, where are the books about kids like us? And it changed my whole attitude.
CHANG: And the rest is history.
SHAPIRO: Thanks to Oregon Public Broadcasting and their documentary ""Discovering Beverly Cleary.""
CHANG: In honor of Cleary, April 12 is Drop Everything and Read day. So if you want to celebrate Beverly Cleary's 103 years, find some time on this Friday and read a book.

Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution, and David Brooks of The New York Times, about the Trump administration's border strategy, Attorney General Barr's testimony and Benjamin Netanyahu's victory in Israel.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
President Trump has promised a tougher approach to immigration. And sure enough, in a tweet today, he said he's giving strong consideration to, quote, ""placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only."" Here's what the president said at the White House today.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They want more people in their sanctuary cities, well, we'll give them more people. We can give them a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply, and let's see if they're so happy. They say, we have open arms. They're always saying they have open arms. Let's see if they have open arms.
CHANG: The administration has so far offered no details on what this would look like in practice, so lots of questions. And we're going to talk through them and more now with our Friday regulars E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution, and David Brooks of The New York Times. Nice to see you guys.
E J DIONNE, BYLINE: Great to be with you.
DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE: Great to see you.
CHANG: All right. So President Trump is threatening to release migrants who've been detained into these so-called sanctuary cities. These are cities where local law enforcement has decided to limit cooperation with federal immigration officials like LA, Chicago, Denver. And in this tweet I read, the president said he's doing this because, quote, ""Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws.""
David, do you think this tweet is actually spelling out policy or does it feel more just like a political provocation?
BROOKS: Well, first, it's morally illiterate. These are human beings. We don't treat them as a sort of a subtweet of a prank. But it's of a piece with the Trump policy, which is not really a policy but just a posture of toughness. It's just showbiz. It's sort of performance art to make his base feel good.
And any mayor running this system would create a system. He would expand the detention centers. He'd get more judges to speed the back flow. We'd have a system where you could vet kids in their home countries so they don't have to walk all the way up here. You do a number of concrete things that any normal administration could do. But we don't do that because we just have a posture. We don't have a system. And as a result, we have chaos at the border.
CHANG: E.J., do you agree?
DIONNE: Yeah. Well, first of all, nothing should surprise us anymore about Trump. But the notion that he would use human beings, as David said, purely as political pawns, as what he sees as political punishment for those who disagree with him - I mean, what comes next, he audits - he urges audits of all income taxes of the people who want him to make his taxes public? I mean, there's just something deeply outrageous about this. And we've lost our capacity for outrage.
I think what you are seeing is the difficulty of reaching any agreement on immigration, which is always hard, even when people have goodwill. They - Bush - President Bush, the second one, tried to get immigration reform through. His party foiled him. There was a bill that went through the Senate under Obama. It was foiled. Now you have no goodwill at all coming from the White House, using it only as a political issue for Trump's re-election.
CHANG: Now, on solutions to immigration, E.J., your paper, The Washington Post, is reporting that when the White House first raised this idea months ago about putting migrants in sanctuary cities, ICE leadership said it was not a good idea. But are President Trump's threats to get tougher on immigration putting pressure on Democrats to come up with more viable solutions for the situation at the border?
DIONNE: Well, the one person who has put out a detailed immigration plan among the candidates for president is Julian Castro. And whether you agree with it or not, I think he set out sort of a position that would be compromised a lot if he ever tried to negotiate it. But at least he's come out there and says, here's what I will do. I think the party, like on a lot of issues, has - let's put it charitably - multiple minds where they should go.
And I think a lot of people say, what's the point of putting out a position when we know that we can't negotiate with Trump? Nonetheless, I think over time, they simply have to take a stand, say, here's what we'll do, and let that be their political position - i.e. we're going to try to solve the problem.
BROOKS: Shockingly, I'd be a lot harder on the Democrats. You know, Castro, I think it's - one of the things he does is he repeals a 1929 law making illegal entry a federal crime, which takes immigration very far. I think a lot of the candidates don't know where the left is on this. They don't know how far that we've gone toward open borders, and they don't want to make a mistake. And therefore they don't have policies. But it's making - I think it's politically and morally extremely foolish not to have a policy on what to do with the big central question on our southern border.
CHANG: All right.
DIONNE: I just want to say, on Castro, I think the fact that he came out there is going to put pressure on other Democrats to put out plans. It's still a long time before between now and the caucuses. But on the point that I think they have to say something and be reasonably clear, I agree with that.
CHANG: All right. I want to turn to Attorney General William Barr now. We're expecting a redacted version of the Mueller report to come any day now. And Barr was on the Hill this week testifying about that report. But he also mentioned something else that took a lot of people by surprise. He said that the Obama administration had spied on the Trump campaign.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
WILLIAM BARR: I think there was - spying did occur. Yes, I think spying did occur.
CHANG: All right. So President Trump has repeatedly accused the Obama White House of spying on his campaign. Barr chimes in this week, seems to agree with him, which prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to say that Barr is doing President Trump's political bidding. David, do you agree with Pelosi on that?
BROOKS: I don't know. The guy does seem to be one for dropping tidbits and then not elaborating. And so I don't think he should have said the spying thing without explaining exactly what it was he was talking about because it was bound to be a bombshell. But in general, I'm willing to wait on this. A lot of people are leaping to conclusions and postures and attitudes without knowing what's in the report or how he's really doing. It'll be out in a few days. Let's just wait.
CHANG: All right.
DIONNE: Four strikes and you're out. I mean, he put out that summary which was - didn't even have a full quote from the Mueller report. He absolved Trump of obstruction by fiat. Now he does the spying thing. And he has been totally muddled. I think for Democrats, he has shown himself to be a partisan figure and not the attorney general of everybody.
CHANG: All right. In our last minute, I want to talk briefly about the Israeli elections. We saw Benjamin Netanyahu win a fifth term as prime minister. And I want to ask you, what does this outcome tell us? Because he won this pretty close election despite the fact he's fighting a lot of corruption allegations. David, you want to begin?
BROOKS: Well, first, if you're a Democrat, don't get overconfident because these kind of campaigns can win. Second, we're in a different situation. Israel tried to be a pluralistic ethnic country with the Oslo peace process and all that. It failed. Netanyahu is the kind of leader you elect when you fail to become a pluralistic democracy. We're still trying to do that. We want to be that kind of country.
CHANG: All right. E.J., in the last 30 seconds.
DIONNE: I think that Israelis, for now, have given up on the peace process. And they see Netanyahu as a tough guy who can hold things together. But boy, there are lessons for us in this. He ran a really scurrilous campaign against Arabs. He tried to decrease the Arab vote, and he succeeded. He is Trump's friend, and Trump helped him.
CHANG: That's E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution, and David Brooks of The New York Times. Thanks to both of you.
BROOKS: Thank you.
DIONNE: Good to be with you.

toggle caption CCTV/Screenshot by NPR CCTV footage shows how three men clawed an ATM out of a wall and made off with a cash box in under five minutes. It is the eighth such incident in Northern Ireland since the start of the year.
CCTV/Screenshot by NPR Thieves in Northern Ireland have taken the idea of a smash and grab to a whole new level in a recent spate of brazen robberies.
With the help of a stolen excavator and a van with an ATM-size hole cut out of its roof, teams of thieves are clawing entire cash boxes out of local businesses and disappearing into the night.
Footage of the most recent theft on Sunday shows at least three men involved in that raid. One drives an excavator (stolen from a nearby construction site) toward an ATM built into the exterior wall of a shop outside of Dungiven. Over and over again he tears at the wall until most of that part of the building is destroyed. He then scoops up the ATM, swivels the arm over to a nearby van that just happens to have a hole cut out of its roof, and with the help of his two accomplices, sporting balaclavas, dumps the booty inside.
The entire endeavor takes about four minutes and 10 seconds.
All three eventually get away and neither the van nor the ATM protruding out of it has been seen again.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland said the Dungiven incident is the eighth ATM theft this year .
""As the weekend approaches, I want to reiterate our appeal to people across Northern Ireland to remain vigilant and alert to any activity that is unusual, out of the ordinary or suspicious, especially the movement of plant machinery late at night or early in the morning,"" Detective Chief Inspector David Henderson said in a statement Friday.
Henderson added that the recent attacks on ATMs will have devastating and long lasting effects on the rural communities where most have taken place.
""The livelihoods of our local businesses are being jeopardised by the thefts and they are forced to face the additional costs involved in repairing their premises. The populations served by the ATMs, which are often rural, are being denied access to cash facilities. Farmers and construction firms are suffering the loss of expensive equipment and machinery, a loss from which some will struggle to recover,"" he said.
Dungiven will be particularly hard hit. The last bank in the town shuttered its doors last year, leaving the rural community entirely reliant on a handful of ATMs ""including one that charges hefty fees,"" The Guardian reported .
""Some people were joking they should've taken that one,"" said construction worker Enda Kealey, according to the newspaper.
Last month, Northern Ireland police established a task force made up of detectives from the organized crime branch to track down the criminals involved.
""We are actively looking at it being several gangs involved,"" Henderson told reporters at a news conference, the BBC reported .
It is unclear how much money has been stolen so far."
Former Diplomats Reflect On Impact Of WikiLeaks Release Of Diplomatic Cables In 2010,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862490/former-diplomats-reflect-on-impact-of-wikileaks-release-of-diplomatic-cables-in-,"Former Diplomats Reflect On Impact Of WikiLeaks Release Of Diplomatic Cables In 2010 Former Diplomats Reflect On Impact Of WikiLeaks Release Of Diplomatic Cables In 2010 Embed Embed
Nearly a decade after WikiLeaks published thousands of diplomatic cables, one former ambassador describes it as ""the toxic gift that keeps on giving."" Diplomats spent years rebuilding trust with other governments.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The State Department was forced into damage control when WikiLeaks published thousands of diplomatic cables back in 2010. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called it an attack on U.S. foreign policy and international alliances. Now that Julian Assange is facing charges related to that leak, we wondered whether it left a lasting impact on U.S. diplomacy. Here's NPR's Michele Kelemen.
MICHELE KELEMEN, HOST:
Retired diplomat Barbara Leaf was in Rome reading The New York Times on an unclassified computer on the day in 2010 when the WikiLeaks cables hit the news. She was shocked to see what's called a NODIS, or no distribution cable, which are normally very restrictive.
BARBARA LEAF: Then I was like, oh, my God. You know? I got to turn this thing off, you know? It was - but beyond the comic moment which, literally, I thought, did I just give myself a security violation by looking at a NODIS cable on an un-class terminal, it wreaked havoc. These cables wreaked havoc.
KELEMEN: That was especially true at her next assignment, in Iraq, where some embassy contacts had been harassed and threatened because they were named in diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks. She says she and her colleagues became far more judicious in what they wrote in those official reports.
LEAF: Some people, I would not name. Yes. Absolutely. I would not put names in cables because of that. Government officials are generally different. But when you're talking to some, you know, average citizen, or somebody who is willing to talk candidly about policies or activities of their government that they know, you know, it's - you know, it's a third-rail topic, or what have you, I didn't put their names in cables forever after.
KELEMEN: Diplomats write these cables to give Washington policymakers a sense of what's happening in the country where they serve. They used to be accessible even to military officers in the field until Chelsea Manning helped WikiLeaks gain access to them. Now access is even more limited. And that's a problem, says Mary Thompson-Jones, another former career diplomat who teaches at the U.S. Naval War College.
MARY THOMPSON-JONES: Not enough people read the cables. That was true then and that's true now. The only person that you're guaranteed is going to read your cable is the poor desk officer who's handling everything that has to do with the country to which you've been assigned.
KELEMEN: She downplays the lasting impact of WikiLeaks on the State Department, saying Julian Assange's moment has come and gone.
THOMPSON-JONES: Technology has moved at lightning speed since then. Every embassy has Facebook, it has social media. Ambassadors get out, and they're tweeting about things. So we're in a different era already than we were nine years ago.
KELEMEN: Looking back, some diplomats joke that there was an upside to the scandal. The world got to see what diplomats do and find out that some are pretty colorful writers. The downside was that government officials who didn't like how they were described gave U.S. diplomats the cold shoulder and didn't let them take notes in meetings. That lasted for a while, says Barbara Leaf, who was the ambassador to the United Arab Emirates until she retired last year.
LEAF: There was an exquisite agony that these governments, friendly governments, felt in talking to us for a very long time. I got out to UAE four years after this, and they were still gun shy about all of this. So, you know, it is the toxic gift that keeps on giving.
KELEMEN: The State Department says it stands by previous assessments that the WikiLeaks disclosures were harmful and put lives and careers at risk. A former spokesman says the impact was serious but admittedly hard to quantify. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, the State Department. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Some Experts Remain Skeptical As Boeing And FAA Work To Assure 737 Max Jet Is Safe,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862466/some-experts-remain-skeptical-as-boeing-and-faa-work-to-assure-737-max-jet-is-sa,"As Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration work to certify critical updates to the 737 Max jet following two deadly crashes, the FAA is under renewed criticism for saying the aircraft was safe.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Officials with the Federal Aviation Administration spent hours today speaking with pilots and executives at Southwest, United and American Airlines. They are the three U.S. airlines that fly the Boeing 737 Max. Questions about the FAA's role in certifying the plane have grown in the weeks since the second fatal crash of a 737 Max. The jet is still grounded. And now, the FAA has to reassure airlines and regulators in other countries that whenever it says the 737 Max is safe to fly again, that is, in fact, accurate. NPR's Russell Lewis reports.
RUSSELL LEWIS, BYLINE: This week on Capitol Hill, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao continued her defense of the FAA amid questions about why it approved the Boeing 737 Max.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ELAINE CHAO: The department's goal is to ensure public trust in aviation safety and preserve the preeminence of the United States as the gold standard in aviation safety.
LEWIS: The U.S. is enjoying its safest period of air travel ever - one single fatality on a major U.S. commercial airline in the past decade. But following the crashes of 737 Max's in Indonesia and Ethiopia, questions are swirling whether the FAA has taken a hit as the world's premier aviation regulator.
SHEM MALMQUIST: So the answer is yes, the FAA has lost some of that credibility.
LEWIS: Shem Malmquist has been involved in aviation and aviation safety since the 1970s. He teaches advanced aircraft operations at Florida Institute of Technology and also currently flies the Boeing 777. He says people in the industry had assumed the FAA was doing everything it could to ensure safety. So was John Strickland, a longtime aviation consultant based in England.
JOHN STRICKLAND: Of course, at the end of the day, what matters is safety. There can only be one objective - that it delivers a safe aircraft which airlines can be confident in and that we, the traveling public, can be confident in.
LEWIS: That's one reason why aviation regulators in Canada, Europe and elsewhere say they plan to double-check the 737 Max software fixes once they're approved by the FAA. Strickland says that's surprising, and before these accidents, almost unheard of.
For decades, the FAA relied on manufacturers like Boeing to help in the review and certification of new jets. These planes are increasingly complex, with millions of lines of computer code understood best by the people who designed them. When the 737 Max was approved, it was one of the first jets signed off under new rules that gave Boeing even more authority in the approval process.
The FAA has told Congress for the agency to take over all certifications, it would need an additional 10,000 employees at $1.8 billion. Jim Higgins chairs the aviation department at the University of North Dakota. He says it's not as easy as just throwing more money at the problem.
JIM HIGGINS: Because it takes many years to train people to become aircraft design engineers for these types of aircraft and then many more to - for them to get the experience to be kind of in an oversight role.
LEWIS: The extra attention being shined on Boeing and the FAA is important, says Shem Malmquist, the Florida Tech professor and pilot. He says now that regulators in other countries are planning to scrutinize the 737 Max fixes, there's value in having men and women from varying backgrounds studying the updates.
MALMQUIST: I think there's something to be said by having different cultures from around the world looking at these things a lot closer. They may capture something just based on their cultural perspective that we didn't consider.
LEWIS: The FAA, for its part, says it welcomes the added scrutiny. Here's acting administrator Daniel Elwell.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DANIEL ELWELL: As recent events have reminded us, aviation safety has no borders or boundaries.
LEWIS: But don't expect a potential fix anytime soon. The updates to the Boeing 737 Max aren't expected for weeks and possibly months. Russell Lewis, NPR News.

Nile Rodgers On Streaming Payments And Songwriters' Letter To Spotify,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712777873/nile-rodgers-streaming-payments-songwriters-letter-spotify,"Enlarge this image Nile Rodgers, photographed in November 2018 in London.

toggle caption Dave J Hogan/Getty Images Nile Rodgers, photographed in November 2018 in London.
Dave J Hogan/Getty Images Earlier this week, a large group of successful songwriters sent Daniel Ek, the co-founder and chief executive of Spotify, a short and pointed letter in which they wrote of being ""hurt and disappointed"" and accusing Spotify of having ""used us and tried to divide us.""
In order to understand why that letter was sent, we need to go back to early February. It was then that a byzantine, but important, decision arrived which would see songwriters' royalties from streaming services increase dramatically over the next five years. But Spotify and several other music streaming services — except for Apple Music — then began appealing that decision. Thus, the letter (which, when asked by NPR, Spotify declined to comment on).
The Record Spotify Cops To Its Problems And Reveals The Massive Ambitions Of Its Founder Immediately after that appeal was filed, Spotify was roundly derided, accused of "" suing songwriters ."" The National Music Publishers Association, which represents the companies that manage songwriters' business interests, scathingly observed that ""no amount of insincere and hollow public relations gestures such as throwing parties or buying billboards of congratulations or naming songwriters 'geniuses' can hide the fact that these big tech bullies do not respect or value the songwriters who make their businesses possible."" It's a characterization which Spotify disagreed with and tried to explain away.
Nile Rodgers , the leader of Chic and recently appointed chairman of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, was one of the signatories to the vexed letter. Speaking as both an artist and an advocate on behalf of them, Rodgers gave NPR a brief overview of what's going on from his perspective.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
NPR Music: Who came up with the idea to send this letter to Spotify and Daniel Ek? What was the process of putting it together?
Nile Rodgers: I was asked by my manager to participate because of my position in the songwriting community, and I felt it was an important message to put out immediately and to support vocally. I think it's intelligently presented and the message is very simple. Spotify, Amazon, et al.: Do not bite the hand that brings you your subscribers.
You're the chairman of the Songwriters Hall of Fame – I have to assume that part of that role is advocacy on behalf of all those who don't make it into the Hall. What are the issues causing you the most concern?
I think it's important, first, to acknowledge that thanks to streaming and companies like Apple, Spotify and Amazon delivering our songs to the consumer conveniently, the best days for music and its creators are once again in front of it. We need to help them succeed, while ensuring we get our fair and equitable slice of the growing pie. Tremendous credit goes to Apple for acknowledging the songwriter's value and affirming the [Copyright Royalty Board] ruling! [ Ed. note: Rodgers is referring to Apple's decision not to appeal the decision raising songwriters' royalties from streaming. ]
Do you think artists' best interests are front-of-mind for Spotify, or any streaming service?
Daniel Ek and Jeff Bezos are highly intelligent people. They understand that people do not pay $10 a month to be able to push buttons on their technology — they spend their money to listen to The Beatles, Dua Lipa, Led Zeppelin, Beyoncé.
If great artists and songs start to disappear from these services, the money will then evaporate and go to whomever can deliver them. I suspect Spotify and Amazon now realize they have handled this badly, and I hope for a swift resolution that has no impact on their growth.
Are songwriters treated fairly in this brave new world of streaming? Or — is streaming even the root of the problem?
Songwriters are not treated fairly! In the U.K., we have created a £350 million publicly listed fund — the Hipgnosis Songs Fund — that has demonstrated to the financial community that hit songs are as investable financial instruments as gold or oil. Our ultimate aim is to use the leverage of that fund to place the songwriter at the top, rather than bottom, of the economic equation. Songs are the currency of the music industry and these creators should be acknowledged and rewarded.
Can streaming as it's structured now ever be equitable, or even profitable, for songwriters – particularly low- and mid-tier independent songwriters, who are often the performers as well? If not, what could a possible solution look like?
There is no question that streaming will become equitable for all involved. History has many answers, and if you look at The Beatles, when they signed their record deal in 1962 [their per-single royalties were fractions of a cent]. By the time they break up, it's over 20 times that. Part of that is because they are The Beatles, but a big part of it is that the business of the long-playing record became more sophisticated, and artists started getting a fairer share of the pie.
We are in the early days of streaming and in due course, with a lot of ""discussion"" and advocacy, we will get what we deserve. For now, Daniel Ek and Jeff Bezos should immediately withdraw their appeal and demonstrate to songwriters that this was an error in judgement and that they value [songwriters'] contributions."

"In Her Debut Novel 'Miracle Creek,' Angie Kim Taps Into Themes She Knows Well",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862497/in-her-debut-novel-miracle-creek-angie-kim-taps-into-themes-she-knows-well,"Angie Kim's debut novel, Miracle Creek, is a courtroom thriller that tackles heavy themes like immigration, parenting and autism.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The new novel ""Miracle Creek"" is a courtroom thriller. It's a world that author Angie Kim knows well. She worked as a trial lawyer at a big firm. And this book taps into other themes she's familiar with, too. Angie Kim's family came to the U.S. from South Korea when she was a child, just like the central characters in the book. And the story also centers on a group of mothers whose kids have autism. Kim has three children who've each dealt with medical issues and the batteries of tests and treatments that go along with them.
ANGIE KIM: Between all of that, I felt like these are the things that I think were in me that needed to get out because I felt the need when I was in those situations to feel like other people understood.
SHAPIRO: This is Angie Kim's first novel, And it begins with a tragedy. She writes, misfortune doesn't get sprinkled out in fair proportions. Bad things get hurled at you in clumps and batches - unmanageable and messy. ""Miracle Creek"" creates a frame for some of those messy threads in Angie Kim's own life, including a childhood where her parents worked from 6 a.m. to midnight every day.
KIM: I came from this environment in Korea where we were very poor. We had no running water. We had no indoor plumbing. And the three of us - my parents and me - we lived in one room. So we were very poor. And yet, at the same time, I had them with me always.
So to go from that environment to an environment where we were in this luxurious house with multiple indoor bathrooms, which was, like, magical to me - and color TVs, but at the same time losing my parents in the process for several years, it was really painful. And I think throughout my life, I felt this sort of rollercoaster between feeling so lucky to have the chance to come to America from...
SHAPIRO: And attend Harvard Law School and have high-paying jobs, right. You are the...
KIM: Exactly.
SHAPIRO: ...American dream success story.
KIM: Exactly. And how sometimes objectively, your life can look good or bad, so my - objectively, my life in Korea was, you know, poverty ridden and things like that. But then in the nooks and crannies, there can be moments of pure joy even when you are in that, you know, poverty stricken home.
SHAPIRO: Yeah. There is a passage where you write about one painful aspect of the immigrant experience. Will you read this? This is from page 163, about halfway through the book.
KIM: (Read) He'd expected this to happen eventually, had seen how children and parents switch places as the parents age - their minds and bodies reverting to childhood, then infancy, then non-being. But not for many years, and certainly not yet, when Mary still had a foot in childhood. In Korea, he had been the teacher. But after his move when he visited Mary's school, her principal had said welcome. Tell me; how are you liking Baltimore? Pak (ph) smiled, nodded and was deciding how to answer. Perhaps the smile-nod had been enough. When Mary said, he loves it here, running the store right by Inner Harbor, right, Dad? The rest of the meeting, Mary continued speaking for him, answering questions directed his way like a mother with her 2-year-old son.
SHAPIRO: That feels very real and very painful.
KIM: It really, really was. We all intellectually understand it's not their first language. So we understand that it doesn't mean that they're not smart for not speaking it or understanding it. And yet, somehow, language is so important in our society that it's become that way.
And I think that's the other reason why I was so drawn to autism as well because I think especially for the children on the autism spectrum who are non-verbal, it makes me think back to that time when I myself felt so frustrated knowing that I had thoughts within me and saying hey, I'm here, I have opinions, I have thoughts...
SHAPIRO: Yeah.
KIM: ...But not being able to articulate that and then being able to see in other people's eyes that they think less of me because I can't speak in that language.
SHAPIRO: The book includes this community of mothers whose children have autism and have varying degrees of severity. And it's this interesting dynamic where on one level, they're kind of competitive and judgmental and jealous. And on another level, they're sort of the only people who can understand what one another is going through.
KIM: Definitely.
SHAPIRO: Tell me about this community that you built within the framework of the book.
KIM: So I became aware of this community going through all of these, you know, speech therapies and things like that as well as the hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which is something that I highlight in the book as well.
SHAPIRO: This is an alternative form of therapy that is thought - in the book at least - to perhaps help with things ranging from impotence to autism.
KIM: Exactly. And one thing that I experienced myself even though I'm not in the autism community per say, but having been in that world of parents with children with chronic illnesses, when the illness takes over your life - and I think that one thing that it does that's very unexpected for me anyway is that it's very isolating because you find that you don't have as much that you want to talk to your old friends about...
SHAPIRO: Right.
KIM: ...When they have a foot in so-called normalcy because, you know, there's both envy at play and also just a feeling of they're not going to understand what's important in my life on a day-to-day basis. So I think this community becomes very important from that perspective.
But, of course, the stakes in this world are very high because it's not just a matter of oh, is your kid going to get into this college or that, it's much more fundamental than that. What is going to happen to my child when I die?
You know, so it's very heightened emotions from that perspective. And that's one of the reasons why I decided to highlight that conflict but also closeness and intimacy.
SHAPIRO: There's one moment that I want to ask you about when a character who is one of these mothers of children with autism says - clearly feeling great shame in saying this - she says I wish my child was dead. And another woman tells her we all have our moments. But they're just moments. And they pass.
So if a tiny part of us has these thoughts a tiny part of the time, thoughts we shut out as soon as they creep in, is that so bad? Isn't that just human? People don't often hear that perspective. Why did you want to include it?
KIM: I wanted to include it because I think there is this myth of a Good Mother. And I say Good Mother, and in my head, I'm seeing Good Mother capitalized, you know.
SHAPIRO: Capital G, capital M.
KIM: Yes, exactly. And I think that when you are in this situation day in and day out, there are thoughts that creep in that are shameful. And I think that because of our society's enormous pressure on mothers to be perfect and to be self-sacrificing, that those thoughts make the mothers feel so much shame.
And one thing that I've been hearing from a lot of early readers is that when they're in this situation, they have had similar thoughts that are fleeting. And they would never say it out loud even to their closest friends or to their family members or to their spouses. But hearing a character - even though it's a fictional character in a book - say that and think that and to be able to witness that made them feel like they weren't monsters themselves.
SHAPIRO: Angie Kim, thanks so much for talking with us. And congratulations on your debut novel.
KIM: Thank you so much, Ari. It was a pleasure.
SHAPIRO: Her book is called ""Miracle Creek.""

Assange's Cat Has Left The Bolivian Embassy : NPR,www.npr.org,Matthew S. Schwartz,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712719377/the-mystery-of-julian-assanges-cat,"Enlarge this image Julian Assange's cat wears a striped tie and white collar as it looks out the window of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2016. Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images Julian Assange's cat wears a striped tie and white collar as it looks out the window of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2016.
Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images Ecuadorian President Lenín Moreno seemed annoyed when he announced an end to the seven-year residency of Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London:
""We've ended the asylum of this spoiled brat,"" he said .
But what about the asylum of Assange's cat?
The WikiLeaks founder, who was arrested Thursday, has been charged with conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer network. Presumably, Assange's alleged illegal interactions with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning are the main interest of law enforcement.
Then there is the matter of paw enforcement. (Sorry.)
While holed up, Assange famously acquired a cat. The cat, named Michi, is more well known by its social media moniker, Embassy Cat . More than 30,000 Twitter followers, and 6,000 on Instagram, followed the self-described master of ""counter-purrveillance.""
New home! I've arrived! pic.twitter.com/N7PeuSti4I
— Embassy Cat (@EmbassyCat) May 9, 2016 Embassy Cat tweeted regularly beginning with its arrival in May 2016. Cute photos were the norm, with just a bit of political grandstanding thrown in — always with lots of puns. (Embassy Cat was proud to be a "" #whiskerblower ."")
But by the fall of 2016, its tweets had become much less frequent. In 2017 the cat tweeted only three times. In 2018, twice. It has been silent for more than a year. (The Instagram account has been crickets for more than two years.)
The New Yorker reported in 2017 that Assange's interest in the cat was less as an animal lover and more as a master of his own brand. ""Julian stared at the cat for about half an hour, trying to figure out how it could be useful, and then came up with this: Yeah, let's say it's from my children,"" the magazine Quote: d one of Assange's friends as saying. ""For a time, he said it didn't have a name because there was a competition in Ecuador, with schoolchildren, on what to name him. Everything is P.R.— everything .""
Shredding! I love pending WikiLeaks releases! #counterpurrveillance ! 😻😻 pic.twitter.com/vrVyJbHe9Q
— Embassy Cat (@EmbassyCat) May 22, 2016 The cat arguably played a small role in Ecuador's decision to end its asylum agreement. Moreno explained that Assange treated his hosts disrespectfully; late last year the embassy implemented a series of rules for Assange, including a requirement to be responsible for the ""well-being, food, hygiene and proper care of your pet."" If Assange didn't, the embassy threatened to put the cat in a shelter.
In other words, it is likely that Assange didn't effectively clean up after his cat's own wiki-leaks.
After Assange was picked up Thursday, some people wondered what would become of Embassy Cat. ""My sympathy to the cat,"" author Charlie Stross tweeted .

— Brent Davidson (@Brentus88) April 11, 2019 Journalist James Ball said that although he offered to adopt the cat, it was ""reportedly given to a shelter by the Ecuadorian embassy ages ago.""
But according to Hanna Jonasson, whom The Washington Post describes as a member of the Assange legal team, Assange was incensed by the threat to put Embassy Cat in the pound. ""He asked his lawyers to take his cat to safety,"" Jonasson said . ""The cat is with Assange's family. They will be reunited in freedom.""
In the same document in which Ecuador threatened to hand Assange over for arrest, Ecuador also threatened to put Assange's cat in the pound.

— Hanna Jonasson (@AssangeLegal) November 27, 2018 Wherever the cat is, it's no longer at the embassy. The Italian paper la Republicca wrote in November that the ""friendly atmosphere"" at the embassy was gone. ""Not even the cat is there anymore. With its funny striped tie and ambushes on the ornaments of the Christmas tree at the embassy's entrance, the cat had helped defuse tension inside the building for years. But Assange has preferred to spare the cat an isolation which has become unbearable and allow it a healthier life.""
The Ecuadorian Embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment. But a spokesperson told Sputnik that the cat hasn't been with the embassy since the fall. ""It was taken by Mr. Assange's associates,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are not a pet store, so we do not keep pets here.""
Clarification April 22, 2019

Enlarge this image Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for GLAAD Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for GLAAD Now in its 19th year, the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is more than a music festival, or even a lifestyle. It's a capital-M moment that seems to stop the world. (And not entirely because Beyoncé willed it so last year.) Beyond the experience of bearing witness to celebrities of the A- and D-lists as they drench themselves in sweat and dust while gorging on trendy cuisine and novelty cocktails, Coachella's influence extends far beyond the festival grounds of Indio, California.
Even Coachella seems to be aware of this: For the first time ever, it's doubling down on its festival streams by showcasing both weekends of the festival. Emergent K-pop group BLACKPINK is set to broadcast its message of sensory-overload pop music in Times Square this weekend. Childish Gambino and Rihanna premiered a new film, and with the aid of Amazon and YouTube, will premiere it globally this weekend for free.
For those looking to avoid the hefty price tag of a festival pass — or reluctant to experience Coachella anywhere but on a couch — we've got you covered. The only catch: You'll need to watch it live on YouTube , as Coachella does not make its sets available after the fact as on-demand videos.
So, without further ado, here are 10 Coachella 2019 acts worth planning your weekend around, in chronological order. And if you're the adventurous sort, you can scan and skip between a whopping 83 live performances across three channels at youtube.com/user/coachella/coachellalive .

Mike Corder/AP A panel of judges at the International Criminal Court has rejected a request to proceed with investigating possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan, including those allegedly involving U.S. armed forces and the CIA.
This is in response to a request from ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda in 2017, a prospect that U.S. officials have strongly criticized.
In their unanimous decision released Friday , the judges said that the prosecutor's request is within the court's jurisdiction and the crimes are of sufficient gravity for it to consider the case. But it said that it was ultimately rejecting the request because ""the current circumstances of the situation in Afghanistan are such as to make the prospects for a successful investigation and prosecution extremely limited.""
The Two-Way ICC Prosecutor Calls For Afghanistan War Crimes Investigation The decision noted that the prosecutor hasn't been able to secure cooperation from the parties, making it very unlikely the probe would succeed. A significant amount of time has passed since many of the crimes were allegedly committed, the judges said, and there's a need for the ICC ""to use its resources prioritizing activities that would have a better changes to succeed.""
Some human rights advocates are slamming the decision as a dangerous precedent.
""ICC judges' decision to reject an investigation in Afghanistan is a devastating blow for victims,"" Human Rights Watch's Param-Preet Singh said in a statement . ""It sends a dangerous message to perpetrators that they can put themselves beyond the reach of the law just by being uncooperative.""
U.S. officials have repeatedly denounced the probe. For example, White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said last September that ""the United States will use any means necessary to protect our citizens and those of our allies from unjust prosecution by the illegitimate court.""
In a further sign of U.S. rejection of the effort, Bensouda's visa to the U.S. was revoked earlier this month.
Law U.S. Strips Visa From World Criminal Court Prosecutor Pursuing War-Crimes Inquiry ""We welcome this decision and reiterate our position that the United States holds American citizens to the highest legal and ethical standards,"" the White House said Friday. ""Since the creation of the ICC, the United States has consistently declined to join the court because of its broad, unaccountable prosecutorial powers; the threat it poses to American national sovereignty; and other deficiencies that render it illegitimate.""
Bensouda submitted more than 20,000 pages of information to the court. She said that the groups allegedly responsible for possible crimes are the Taliban and other armed groups, Afghan forces, and U.S. personnel.
As the decision notes, the prosecutor says ""there is reasonable basis to believe that, since May 2003, members of the US armed forces and the CIA have committed the war crimes of torture and cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, and rape and other forms of sexual violence pursuant to a policy approved by US authorities.""
She also said that the Taliban and other armed groups have carried out ""a widespread and systemic attack on civilians perceived as supporting the Afghan government and foreign entities,"" and that there is also ""reasonable basis"" to believe that war crimes have been committed against people detained by the Afghan National Security Forces.
Some critics view the court's decision as a sign that it bowed to U.S. pressure. But the reality may be more complicated, as Harvard Law professor Alex Whiting wrote in a commentary on Just Security .
""This decision will likely come to be seen as the beginning of a broader effort by the judges and the Prosecutor to orient the Court's very limited resources toward those investigations where there exists some meaningful prospect of success,"" Whiting wrote. ""What is critical to this decision is that while the U.S. was the most vocal in its opposition to the Court's investigation, none of the potential targets were supportive of the Court's efforts.""
The ICC, which was established when the Rome Statute took effect in 2002, is charged with prosecuting crimes of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the crime of aggression. It has focused on African countries, which has been a source of criticism.

What Pope Benedict's Letter On The Sex Abuse Scandal Means For Catholics : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862518/what-pope-benedicts-letter-on-the-sex-abuse-scandal-means-for-catholics,"What Pope Benedict's Letter On The Sex Abuse Scandal Means For Catholics What Pope Benedict's Letter On The Sex Abuse Scandal Means For Catholics Embed Embed
NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with Natalia Imperatori-Lee, associate professor of religious studies at Manhattan College, about Pope Benedict's letter about sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
It has been six years since Pope Benedict XVI became pope emeritus. Having two living men who lay claim to the title Pope, one retired and one active, has not happened in centuries. Nevertheless, that is the current state of play in the Roman Catholic Church, and there have been moments when the retired pope has stepped on the message of the current pope. Just this week, Benedict released a letter weighing in on the church's massive sex abuse scandal.
And to talk more about that letter and what it means for Catholics, we're joined now by Natalia Imperatori-Lee. She is associate professor of religious studies at Manhattan College. Welcome.
NATALIA IMPERATORI-LEE: Thank you very much for having me.
CHANG: So Benedict's letter is seen as controversial because of where he places blame for the church's sex abuse scandals. Can you tell us a little more about exactly what Benedict wrote?
IMPERATORI-LEE: So Pope Benedict wrote a letter that reflects kind of his ideas about what caused the scandal and what threatens the church, which is basically the sexual revolution then uprisings of the 1960s, a sort of libertarianism when it comes to morals and the departure of God from the public square.
CHANG: I mean, we should point out that, you know, it's highly unusual that he's even speaking up. He had originally said he would remain, ""hidden to the world"" - that's a direct quote. But that no longer seems to be the case. Do we know why he's jumping into the fray now?
IMPERATORI-LEE: No. I think it's most confusing why he would jump into the fray now, particularly with this intervention which, by referring to the sexual revolution or the 1960s, is really stuff that he had talked about while he was the pope. And so it's unclear why he or the people around him felt the need to weigh in once again with the sort of causes of the crisis that we already knew he believed.
CHANG: Right. I mean, how does Pope Benedict's letter conflict with what Pope Francis has said about the clergy abuse crisis?
IMPERATORI-LEE: Well, I think the main problem is that it doesn't mention victims at all. The hallmark of Francis' approach to the sexual abuse crisis has been that he has centered victims' voices. If you look at Benedict's letter, the victim in his letter is the church. And that's a real slap in the face to people who have survived sexual abuse.
CHANG: So what are the implications of this for Catholics? I mean, having two popes - one who is officially in power, one who is not - who are now saying different things about such a critical issue for the church?
IMPERATORI-LEE: Yeah. I don't want to overstate it. I don't think that anybody thinks that Benedict is still the pope. But I do worry that it flirts with a kind of divisiveness that is unhelpful. We all know that not everybody is supportive of Pope Francis centering the voice of victims or Pope Francis' approach to how he runs the church with openness. And so I worry that it encourages people who criticize Pope Francis into looking backward to the pope emeritus as their pontiff, or their shepherd or something like that, which is really dangerous to the unity of the church.
CHANG: Right. And where does that leave Vatican leadership? I mean, is it possible that this conflict between Benedict and Francis could cause a schism among the highest levels in the Vatican?
IMPERATORI-LEE: I don't think that it will. I think that the resistance to Pope Francis is small, even if sometimes it gets loud. I think that it's not even a conflict, probably, between the two men. I think that Francis holds Benedict in high esteem and values his opinion. It's just when that opinion spills out into the public that you have these competing visions, and then forcing Catholics to maybe choose a side is not exactly where we want the church to be.
CHANG: Natalia Imperatori-Lee. She's an associate professor of religious studies at Manhattan College. Thank you very much for joining us today.

Lobbyists See The Indictment Of Powerful Lawyer Gregory Craig As A Warning,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862511/lobbyists-see-the-indictment-of-powerful-lawyer-gregory-craig-as-a-warning,"Lobbyists See The Indictment Of Powerful Lawyer Gregory Craig As A Warning Lobbyists See The Indictment Of Powerful Lawyer Gregory Craig As A Warning Embed Embed
The indictment of lawyer and lobbyist Gregory Craig, a former Obama White House counsel, is sending a shockwave through the ranks of those who represent foreign entities.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
In Washington, lobbyists are reading this week's indictment of a powerful lawyer named Gregory Craig as a warning. Craig did some work for lobbyist Paul Manafort, President Trump's onetime campaign chairman who now faces a long prison sentence. NPR's Peter Overby reports.
PETER OVERBY, BYLINE: Gregory Craig was the top lawyer in President Barack Obama's White House. Before that, he was on the defense team for President Bill Clinton's impeachment. Right now Craig is an object lesson for lobbyists who deal with or should deal with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. It's commonly called FARA.
KATE BELINSKI: There really has been a sea change in how people are approaching FARA registration and really thinking and taking seriously whether they do need to register.
OVERBY: Kate Belinski is a lawyer who helps lobbyists navigate FARA's requirements. She said that since Craig's case became public a few weeks ago, she's been getting a lot of calls about whether and how to register.
BELINSKI: I wasn't getting those calls on a regular basis before.
OVERBY: FARA enforcement is up to the Justice Department. Before 2017, enforcement was extremely light. Then special counsel Robert Mueller's task force arrested Manafort, and Belinski said Congress now pays much closer attention.
BELINSKI: DOJ is at a point right now where they can't be in a position where they're not enforcing.
OVERBY: Toby Moffett, a longtime FARA registrant and former congressman, said that since Manafort's arrest...
TOBY MOFFETT: You hear a lot more people talk about it and speak with some fear about violating the statute possibly.
OVERBY: Moffett noted the fine already paid by Craig's former law firm, Skadden, Arps - $4.6 million.
MOFFETT: The Skadden experience has probably, to put it mildly, gotten the attention of other firms, especially law firms which are very reputation-conscious.
OVERBY: Senate Judiciary Chair Charles Grassley wants to change the lobbying laws. He would make lobbyists register under FARA if their clients are the U.S. subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies. Those subsidiaries currently come under the law for domestic lobbying, where disclosure is far less strict. Paul Miller is president of the Institute for Lobbying and Ethics, a lobbyist organization. He said FARA's stronger disclosure is good. But FARA has filing fees.
PAUL MILLER: But for small firms who do it, you know, it's just over $600 a year for the filing. And then the paperwork is a headache.
OVERBY: That would still leave open some big loopholes. People avoid both lobbying laws by calling themselves strategic advisers.
MILLER: It's not new. I mean, these things seem to be happening, and that's why we keep talking about, you know, the shadow lobbying.
OVERBY: There's also the risk of bad publicity. Tom Susman is a former lobbyist now with the American Bar Association.
TOM SUSMAN: Nobody wants to be part of the NPR story about having violated one of the federal laws when your job depends on your reputation and your credibility.
OVERBY: But those laws have proved tough to change. Peter Overby, NPR News, Washington. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Former WikiLeaks Employee Discusses Julian Assange's Arrest,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862504/former-wikileaks-employee-discusses-julian-assanges-arrest,"NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with James Ball, a former Wikileaks employee, about the recent arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The arrest of Julian Assange has renewed the debate, is the co-founder of WikiLeaks a journalist or a criminal? Yesterday on the program, we heard from one of his critics, former defense secretary and former CIA Director Leon Panetta.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
LEON PANETTA: If we care about classified information, if we care about what our intelligence people are doing, then I think it's important that we decide whether or not somebody has the right on his own to not only gather that kind of information but release it.
SHAPIRO: Now we're joined by someone who used to work with Julian Assange. James Ball is a journalist and former WikiLeaks employee speaking with us from a street corner in London. Hi there.
JAMES BALL: Hi there.
SHAPIRO: You argue that Assange is unlikable, that he is a difficult person but that it's still important to defend him. Why?
BALL: I should be specific on this. I think it's important to defend him against the U.S. extradition on the charge that he's currently facing. I think he deliberately breached due process in the U.K., and he is right to be punished for breach of bail there. What I don't think we should do it just because we don't like Julian Assange as a person or we don't like his journalistic ethics or maybe we don't even think he's a journalist - we shouldn't let that blind us to what looks at the moment like a politically motivated and dangerous prosecution.
SHAPIRO: He has described himself as a journalist. You're saying we may disapprove of his journalistic ethics, but we should still evaluate his actions on that basis. His critics will say that as opposed to exercising any kind of editorial judgment, he was just a tool for intelligence agencies, including those of Russia.
BALL: I think if someone has evidence that Assange was a knowing tool of the Russian state, then that's something that he should face prosecution for. But that is not the charge on the table. The charge on the table relates to material leaked by Chelsea Manning. She was an ideologically motivated whistleblower. The charge around Assange is that he offered some help in cracking a password that might have made it easier for her to hide her actions. There's actually no evidence that was even successful.
And so it doesn't change the fact that we're dealing with a public interest whistleblower. And the material that was published was judged to be in the public interest by The New York Times, by The Guardian, by Le Monde, by Der Spiegel and more.
SHAPIRO: If I as a journalist with NPR helped somebody who works for the Defense Department or the CIA or the NSA hack into a secure server or access classified documents, I would likely be prosecuted for that independent of what I might do as a journalist. Are you saying that shouldn't be the case?
BALL: I think we have to look at the proportionality of the prosecution. The allegation is that Assange sort of offered to help crack a password unsuccessfully that would have helped someone who was already leaking material not be discovered. That's the kind of mistake I could see someone not trained in journalism sort of doing in a close source relationship. I think 10 years after the fact, to try and pursue that for prosecution - you know, you don't have to be a cynic to see it as a backdoor way of trying to punish Assange for the 2010 disclosures while hiving off journalistic support because we can all call it hacking and say it's different to what we do.
SHAPIRO: It's clear that while you believe that prosecutors are making the wrong decision here, that doesn't make you a fan of Assange personally. What made you decide to go work for him and for WikiLeaks at a time when he had basically driven away everybody else who had worked with him prior to that?
BALL: I mean, I was a young guy. I was 24. Assange was quite inspiring to me. And it takes time, especially when you're at that age, to see the reality of someone versus the image or the icon. And I really believed in the mission of what WikiLeaks was trying to do - you know, responsible disclosure, holding power to account. And then of course when I saw the reality, I came to a much more nuanced fear of Julian, to say the least.
SHAPIRO: James Ball is a journalist in London who used to work for WikiLeaks. Thanks so much for speaking with us today.
BALL: Thanks very much - good to speak to you.

Zimbabwean forces have engaged in ""systematic torture"" of protesters, the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission has found. The torture, mostly consisting of ""indiscriminate and severe beatings,"" follows several days of looting, fires and street barricades by protesters angry over high fuel prices.
The country has been mired in violent protests after President Emmerson Mnangagwa more than doubled fuel prices earlier this month. At least 12 people have been reported killed, while hundreds have been arrested and jailed. Mnangagwa was initially seen as a more liberal successor to the authoritarian leader Robert Mugabe, who left power after 37 years in office. But as NPR has reported , Zimbabweans fear Mnangagwa may be just as repressive as his predecessor. Likewise, violence or misconduct by our security forces is unacceptable and a betrayal of the new Zimbabwe. Chaos and insubordination will not be tolerated. Misconduct will be investigated. If required, heads will roll 3/4 — President of Zimbabwe (@edmnangagwa) January 22, 2019
Witnesses told the ZHRC that security forces from the Zimbabwe National Army and Zimbabwe Republic Police went into houses at night, asked the males to go outside and lie on the ground, and then beat them. Forces ""would also target men and boys who live in houses that are near areas where looting took place or where barricades were set up and just make dragnet arrests without investigating,"" the report said. Boys as young as 11 years old were allegedly beaten.
""Torture was perpetrated through beating the men with baton sticks on their backs while they lay on the ground,"" the ZHRC found. In some cases, troops specifically targeted people sympathetic to the opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change, including members of parliament, the commission said.
Responding to the report, a senior official told journalists that ""when things get out of hand, a little firmness is needed,"" the BBC reported .
In a statement, Mnangagwa condemned the violence by the country's security forces. ""Violence or misconduct by our security forces is unacceptable and a betrayal of the new Zimbabwe,"" he said on Twitter . ""Chaos and insubordination will not be tolerated. Misconduct will be investigated. If required, heads will roll."" Enlarge this image

Mnangagwa also defended his effort to stabilize the country's fuel supply by increasing prices, and criticized the violent protests that ensued. ""Everyone has the right to protest, but this was not a peaceful protest,"" he said . ""Wanton violence and cynical destruction; looting police stations, stealing guns and uniforms; incitement and threats of violence. This is not the Zimbabwean way.""
The torture reported by the ZHRC is an escalation of the type of repression the country experienced during the recent election , NPR's East Africa Correspondent Eyder Peralta reports. ""Zimbabwe has a long record of significant human rights abuses,"" he says. ""Security agents have long acted with impunity to silence and sideline dissenters.""
Although the ZHRC is an independent government agency mandated by the constitution, it doesn't have the power to dole out punishment, Peralta says. ""So little action is likely to come out of this report."" Last year, the government put together another independent government commission to look at the killing of six people following the elections last year. That commission found the military used excess force , but no one has been punished, Peralta reports.

Nigerian-Born Rapper Thutmose On His Debut 'Man On Fire' : NPR,www.npr.org,Christina Cala,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712778089/thutmose-experiments-with-genres-while-honoring-his-nigerian-roots,"Enlarge this image Thutmose's debut project Man On Fire is out now.

Sam Gold/Courtesy of the artist Thutmose is the name of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh, but it's also the stage name of Nigerian-born rapper and songwriter Umar Ibrahim. After immigrating with his family to Brooklyn, N.Y. at the age of 8, Thutmose grew up caught between the America he was experiencing and the America he imagined. ""The hip-hop, the R&B, the aggressiveness of New York City, the diversity — it was such a culture shock and I was a rather quiet kid,"" Thutmose says.
But in the midst of all the chaos, the sounds of Kendrick Lamar and Jay-Z helped the young musician make sense of the world and inspired him to make music of his own. Thutmose's debut project, Man on Fire , out now, gives a brief glimpse into the young immigrant's story.
YouTube Introduced to the scene through SoundCloud, Thutmose gained notoriety with a freestyle over Kendrick Lamar's hit record ""HUMBLE.,"" and used that momentum to release his own songs. His early experiences with New York stuck with him and influence much of his music.
""I was merely observing people, observing cultures, making friends, having crushes for the first time,"" Thutmose says. ""So it's just a lot of new experiences for me, good and bad.""
One of his first memories in the United States was when a SWAT team raided his family home and put a gun to his father's head. Young Thutmose had to quickly learn how to remain calm and cope. He has used music as his outlet to experiment and process such events and this ingenuity shows. This is a theme in Man on Fire.
""Hip hop is rooted, was birthed in New York, so there's a history of flipping your story into something positive"" Thutmose says. ""We're still here. Everybody's alive. Everybody's living, doing their own stuff, trying to chase their dreams. Trying to keep the energy positive and optimistic because that's the only way, I feel like, to really live a good life.""

WHO's Fair Pricing Forum Looks To Fix 'Broken' Global Drug Pricing : Goats and Soda : NPR,www.npr.org,Jason Beaubien,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/04/12/712715387/why-astronomical-drug-prices-are-bad-for-health-and-profits,"Enlarge this image Immunizations are one of the most cost-effective health interventions. Yet some vaccines are too expensive to be distributed in low- and middle-income countries. Jurgen Batz/Getty Image Jurgen Batz/Getty Image Immunizations are one of the most cost-effective health interventions. Yet some vaccines are too expensive to be distributed in low- and middle-income countries.
Jurgen Batz/Getty Image The price of pharmaceuticals around the world can vary dramatically depending on who's paying for the drugs and where those patients happen to live.
Take the pneumonia vaccine. Doctors Without Borders just struck a deal on it for refugee children in Greece. The aid group will pay $9 per immunization for a drug with a list price of $540. In local Greek pharmacies, the vaccine costs $168. France pays $189 for the inoculation while the far less wealthy nation of Lebanon pays $243 for it, according to the group. In India you can get it for roughly $60.
The global drug pricing system is ""broken,"" says Fatima Suleman , a professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa. ""Affordability used to be an issue primarily for low- and middle-income countries, but it's now a global issue,"" she says.
This weekend, Suleman is participating in the Fair Pricing Forum , a conference sponsored by the World Health Organization. The event brings together pharmaceutical executives, government health officials, academics and advocacy groups to look at ways to make global drug prices more affordable — while also benefiting drug manufacturers.
We called up Suleman, who specializes in pharmaceutical policy, to ask her how the global health community could help patients get access to medicines they need and allow drug companies to reach much larger markets. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Why not just let the free market sort out the price?
Well, because we are looking at a free market that's failing. Otherwise, why would something like insulin — that's almost a century old — still be priced so high that people are going into poverty not just in the U.S. but in countries like Tanzania and elsewhere to get access to their medicines? If this market was working, something like insulin would now be at an affordable price. But it's not.
There's something in the system of medicine pricing that's broken and it's something that we need to really look at and figure out how we can fix.
Part of what you are arguing is that changes in global pricing could potentially benefit pharmaceutical companies by giving them increased access to billions of new customers in low- and middle-income countries. Have you seen an example of this?
Absolutely. We saw this with hepatitis C, where at first, the treatment was priced so high in the U.S. and in Europe it was unaffordable in most of the world. [The hepatitis C treatment released by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead in 2014 cost more than $1,000 per pill, and a single course of treatment was approximately $80,000.]
Other manufacturers in certain regions of the world [were allowed] to produce the medicines and supply them to certain areas at a much lower price. [Gilead granted licenses to two companies to produce generic versions of the drug to sell only in low-income countries. These were markets where few customers could afford the original list price.] And we saw the price of the hepatitis C medicines fall dramatically.
How do you address the fact that some medicines, no matter what you do, are going to be incredibly expensive to produce?
We want transparency from the industry. Tell us what your research and development costs are, whether it's an expensive way of production that you can't get away from or whether it's a failed production line or a failed [clinical trial].
As long as everybody is aware about that, people will be much more inclined to say OK, I'm ready to pay a little bit extra for this medicine because I know that it will help fund something that's going to help me further down the line.
But at the moment there's all this murkiness. Part of the concern is the kickbacks, discounts, rebates, the perverse incentives in the system that are also unclear. So all we're saying is: Can we get transparency?
Any final thoughts on the push for fair pricing globally for drugs?
We need more dialogue [for example, at the current forum]. At the end of the day, we have patients saying, ""I want access to these high-cost medicines. Why am I not getting it?"" And I think people need to understand that changing systems is slow. [That] it doesn't happen overnight, but that there is a global attention on this issue and we are hearing their voices and we do want change. And that's why these forums take place."

NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with David Chen and Vanity Fair's Joanna Robinson, co-hosts of the podcast A Cast of Kings, about how to talk about Game of Thrones even if you've never watched an episode.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
All right. Bad news for those stragglers out there - if you have not started watching ""Game Of Thrones"" yet, there are literally not enough hours left to catch up between now and the final season premiere on Sunday. But not to worry - we are here to help you pretend you know what's going on. We'll catch you up faster than you can say, ""Game Of Thrones"" is a show about a bunch of noble families on a fictional medieval continent battling for control while hordes of ice zombies march towards civilization. So here you go - a TV cheat sheet. Spoilers, of course, lie ahead. And here to help are David Chen and Joanna Robinson. They co-host the podcast A Cast of Kings. Hey, guys.
JOANNA ROBINSON: Hi.
DAVID CHEN: Hello.
CHANG: All right. So what is the state of play as we head into Season 8?
CHEN: So there's many players. And they all want a chance at sitting on the Iron Throne, which is the literal seat of power. It's where, like...
ROBINSON: Wait, Dave. Are you trying to tell me that this is a literal game of thrones? Is that what you're saying?
CHEN: It is a literal - it's literally a game of thrones, which is the name of the show.
CHANG: How clever.
ROBINSON: OK. The way that I like to explain it is to break it down into teams. So first of all, you've got Team Army of the Dead - literal zombies. They are invading from way up north. There's Team Targaryen. They're the ones with the dragons and led by a very cute and scary blonde lady. They're headed north to try to stop the army of the dead and to join up with our third team, Team Stark. They're the ones with the magical wolves. And they're led by a very cute and broody guy with curly, dark hair. And the last team is Team Lannister - mostly just one queen left on this team. She has no magical pets, unless you count her zombie bodyguard. She's sending her troops up north but not to help the army of the living. She's out for herself.
CHANG: So I think for some people, like for me at first, ""Game Of Thrones"" was kind of a turnoff because of all the fantasy, weird, fictional, medieval stuff. What ideas do you think this show gets at that might be interesting to people who are just not into dragons?
ROBINSON: I think if you go into ""Game Of Thrones"" thinking that you understand who's going to win, what a hero is, the beautiful thing that this story does is it just blows all of that out of the water. You're rooting for someone. And all of a sudden, they vanish off the game board. Or you write someone off as evil. And then they have this great moral growth.
CHANG: Yeah.
ROBINSON: So the fact that it's morally murky and complex in a way that - I think people dismiss fantasy as being too simplistic.
CHANG: So we've covered some of the basics. But now I want to get to some next-level stuff because if I want to sound smart and, like, fake my way through caring about what's going to happen to the bazillion characters on this show, I need some good questions to just kind of throw around. Give me some.
CHEN: Well, I think the one that everyone has been talking about is who is going to be the person who ends up sitting on the iron throne? You've got to kind of choose a side. And asking other people which side they're on is a good way to get a conversation started at a party.
ROBINSON: Yeah, that's my favorite question. I think if you want to sound, like, really smart and hipster at a party, when someone says, who do you think is going to sit on the Iron Throne? - you roll up and say, like, does the Iron Throne even matter anymore, really, in the grand scheme of things?
CHANG: (Laughter) All right. I'll use that one.
ROBINSON: I think that's a (laughter) good answer.
CHEN: I would say another question that a lot of people have is, who is going to survive until the end of the show. There's people who have, like, death pools going on or brackets of who's going to, like, make it to the end of the show.
CHANG: That's sunny.
CHEN: The show is so adept at killing off characters. People say between 2,000 and 150,000 deaths.
CHANG: That's quite a discrepancy you've just cited.
ROBINSON: That's what happens when you have a battle episode every single season.
CHANG: Oh, good point.
ROBINSON: You get a lot of bodies, you know?
CHANG: So this show launched, like, a thousand memes, right. What are some catchphrases I should know?
ROBINSON: What's been actually really helpful for spreading the popularity of ""Game Of Thrones"" is the fact that in this show, each of the houses, each of the families have their own, like, personal mottos and house words. So winter is coming is sort of the most famous one. And that's the House Stark house words, you could say.
CHANG: So, like, use winter is coming in context.
ROBINSON: I would say winter is coming if, like, prepare for the worst. Something bad is coming. You know what I mean? So if someone is moving in next door and it's not who you want, you just go, winter is coming next door.
(LAUGHTER)
CHANG: All right. So if I'm trying to decide, is it even worth bingeing at this point, how would you sell me on going for it?
ROBINSON: Maybe wait until it's all over.
CHANG: (Laughter).
ROBINSON: Well, you might want to find out if the ending feels worth it. I think when ""Lost"" ended and so many people were burned out on that ending, they were like, well, I'm just never going to catch up with this show.
CHANG: Such a great example.
ROBINSON: Thanks for saving me that time, you know? So...
CHEN: I have a pitch to make you, Ailsa.
CHANG: Uh-huh.
CHEN: There is no equal to this show in terms of popular culture right now. It's a show that everyone is talking about the day after it airs. There's something invigorating and fun about participating in a work of popular culture with millions of other people at the same time. And this show is one of the only ones that gives you that. And it might be one of the last ones that give you that.
CHANG: David Chen and Joanna Robinson are co-hosts of the podcast A Cast of Kings. Joanna also has two other ""Game Of Thrones"" podcasts - wow - and writes for Vanity Fair. Thank you to both of you.
ROBINSON: Thanks so much for having us.
CHEN: Thank you so much.

The central part of the country had heavy snow and strong winds Thursday. That storm system is now moving to the Great Lakes area. Power has been knocked out for tens of thousands of people.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
If you live in the central part of this country, you don't need us to tell you about the weather you're having. Starting in the Southwest and then spreading to the Great Lakes, wind and snow have been your daily companions, and many of you have lost power.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
This is the second bomb cyclone to hit the region in a month. In weather speak, the low strengthened as the system moved east.
DAVID ROTH: Which actually was the cause of a lot of the mischief.
SHAPIRO: David Roth is with the National Weather Service. He says although the system was not as bad as the March storm, the sudden drop in air pressure was severe.
ROTH: They recorded wind gusts across West Texas as high as 78 miles an hour. Last I heard, there were over 20 wildfires that have been caused by the system.
CHANG: KLBK photojournalist Larry Rodriguez in Lubbock, Texas, was driving around the city on assignment Wednesday when he pulled over to take a video of the dust storm.
LARRY RODRIGUEZ: Before the dust started kicking up, it was a very sunny day here. And then all of a sudden, this red-orange dust gets blown up into the sky. And you can still see the sun, but it's just orange. I've never been to Mars, but I would imagine that's what it would be like.
CHANG: Maybe some of that dirt showed up in a tweeted photo posted by Jennifer Everly in Minnesota. It shows the words Texas Dust written in dirty snow on the hood of a car.
SHAPIRO: In another part of Minnesota, the state patrol took a video of one of their troopers fighting the wind on an ice-covered road in the town of Lakefield. He slides sideways and finally succumbs falling to the ground.
CHANG: To the east, snowfall topped previous records in parts of Wisconsin.
HOPE KIRWAN, BYLINE: April always feels a little late for snow.
SHAPIRO: Hope Kerwan is a public radio reporter in southwestern Wisconsin. She pulled her car over in the town of Westby to talk to us. She says it wasn't just snow.
KIRWAN: On my commute in yesterday, there was thunder snow, where it's snowing but there's thunder and lightning. There were a lot of power outages because of the winds knocking over poles. I know a lot of communities around the La Crosse area were affected by that.
CHANG: All told, it was bad enough. But the second bomb cyclone could have been worse. For those folks along the Missouri River who got flooded after the last bomb cyclone, there's good news. The Weather Service says this storm is not expected to cause further flooding because the ground isn't frozen anymore. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

PBS premieres a new version of Victor Hugo's Les Misérables, starring Dominic West of The Wire and The Affair. This version has no music and tries to be closer to the source material.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Many people were introduced to the classic ""Les Miserables"" through the Tony Award-winning musical version.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, ""LES MISERABLES"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Look down. Look down. Don't look them in the eye.
CHANG: Well, a new six-episode miniseries of ""Les Mis"" debuts Sunday. And there's no music. PBS's ""Masterpiece"" instead focuses on the story. NPR TV critic Eric Deggans says he was surprised at how little he missed the music.
ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: This could sound like heresy to fans of the classic musical, but I love ""Les Miserables"" without the songs. At least, I love writer Andrew Davies and director Tom Shankland's music-less version of this story, which recreates the broad sweep of Victor Hugo's classic 1862 French novel with an epic, emotional treatment.
The show's power comes courtesy of its two leads - Dominic West, who plays convict-turned-hero Jean Valjean and David Oyelowo, who is Javert, the policeman who relentlessly hunts him down. Their first scenes together are electric, as Javert assures Valjean he's a convict because it's in his nature.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""LES MISERABLES"")
DAVID OYELOWO: (As Javert) I was born in prison. My parents were criminals. Men like us have only two choices - to prey on society or to guard it. You chose the former. I chose the latter.
DOMINIC WEST: (As Jean Valjean) Nineteen years for a loaf of bread.
OYELOWO: (As Javert) You've got 12 months left to serve. My guess, you'll be back in here before another year has gone by.
DEGGANS: It's interesting to see a black man play the ultimate cop given today's debates about over-policing people of color. But the central issue in ""Les Miserables"" centers on character. Are people inherently bad or do they simply make bad choices in desperate circumstances?
The story also suggests that love is the best response to tough times. West and the always excellent Derek Jacobi bring this point home while recreating a classic scene from the novel. A fresh out of prison Valjean is given a place to sleep by a Bishop played by Jacobi. The bishop challenges Valjean to love his fellow man despite his hard life.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""LES MISERABLES"")
WEST: (As Jean Valjean) How can I love my fellow man when he treats me worse than a dog? It's easy for you. You can afford to be kind and gentle.
DEREK JACOBI: (As Bishop Myriel) Absolutely right. It is easy for me. But consider this - even if the world has done you a great injustice, does it really serve you to have a heart full of bitterness and hatred?
DEGGANS: West is the lynchpin of this miniseries. As Valjean progresses from hardened ex-convict to an upstanding businessman with a fake identity, the actor remains compelling and believable. With a glance, West can reveal Valjean as a flawed man reaching towards redemption but often undone by impulsive decisions and the guilt of his past misdeeds.
Lily Collins is another delight as Fantine, a poor woman whose life is ruined by trusting the wrong people. When she falls in love with a wealthy young aristocrat who is romancing her, a friend warns her of that folly.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""LES MISERABLES"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) You have to remember, they're not serious, these types. They're just amusing themselves. The ground we walk on is not solid ground, Fantine. We could fall through any time. We could be down in the gutter and no one would care. Plenty more where we come from.
LILY COLLINS: (As Fantine Thibault) But why should it always be like that?
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Because it is.
DEGGANS: Fantine learns the hard way how right her friend is. That she pays such a heavy price when Valjean arguably makes worse mistakes and survives feels like a nod to the persistent inequality between the sexes. A co-production with the BBC, PBS's miniseries vividly recreates the crushing poverty and immense gaps between the lives of the wealthy and the poor in post-Napoleonic France.
This is why a new version of ""Les Miserables"" makes sense right now, as America and the world is already wrestling with tough questions centered on poverty, policing, wealth gaps and social justice.

Sergio Martinez-Beltran/WPLN Sergio Martinez-Beltran/WPLN In the Tennessee Capitol, state Rep. Matthew Hill took heat from abortion-rights proponents last month who had gathered to protest a bill he favored that would ban abortions after about six weeks' pregnancy. That legislation was eventually thwarted in the Tennessee Senate, however, when some of his fellow Republicans voted it down, fearing the high cost of court challenges.
Sergio Martinez-Beltran/WPLN The new anti-abortion tilt of the U.S. Supreme Court has inspired some states to further restrict the procedure during the first trimester of pregnancy and move to outlaw abortion entirely if Roe v. Wade ever falls. But the rush to regulate has exposed division among groups and lawmakers who consider themselves staunch abortion opponents.
On Thursday, Ohio became the latest state to ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected . For a long time, Ohio Right to Life supported a more gradual approach to restrict the procedure and deemed what's come to be called a ""heartbeat bill"" too radical — until this year. Restricting abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected basically bans the procedure after six weeks' gestation — before many women know they're pregnant.
""We see the Court as being much more favorable to pro-life legislation than it has been in a generation,"" spokeswoman Jamieson Gordon says. ""So we figured this would be a good time to pursue the heartbeat bill as the next step in our incremental approach to end abortion-on-demand.""
The Ohio law contains no exception for pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest; it does have an exception for the life of the mother.
National A Bill Banning Most Abortions Becomes Law In Ohio National Activists Brace For 2019 Abortion-Rights Battles In The States Some say the rush to pass these bills is about lawmakers competing to get their particular state's law before the Supreme Court. The state that helped overturn Roe v. Wade would go down in history.
More than 250 bills restricting abortions have been filed in 41 states this year, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research and advocacy group.
""After the appointment of Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh, there really is just an environment in state legislatures to roll back abortion rights. And so we're seeing these bans just fly through,"" says Elizabeth Nash , who monitors state laws at Guttmacher.
But the speed of passage of some of these laws masks divisions about strategy and commitment to the cause within the anti-abortion movement.
Tennessee infighting over heartbeat bill
In Tennessee, for instance, there's a philosophical split between pragmatists and idealists.
A heartbeat bill in the state has had high-profile support, including from Tennessee's new governor. But the Republican attorney general warned that such a law would be difficult to defend in court. And several Republicans, swayed by that logic, voted no on the bill.
""This is an issue that is extremely important to me. It's the reason I got into politics many years ago,"" Republican state Rep. Bill Dunn said as the House approved the measure over his objection earlier this year. Dunn says he wants to stop abortion, but that will require strategy. He points out that no heartbeat bill has ever been enforced. And recent laws in Iowa and Kentucky have been immediately blocked in court. The same is expected for Ohio .
""No. 1, it'll probably never save a life if we go by what's happened in the past,"" Dunn argued on the Tennessee House floor.
But it's money that ultimately stopped the heartbeat bill this year in Tennessee (it stalled in committee this week, though the state's Senate Judiciary Committee agreed to review the bill this summer).
Law Federal Judge Blocks North Carolina Ban On Abortions Later Than 20 Weeks Senate Speaker Randy McNally is anti-abortion but says he has no interest in wasting tax dollars to make a point.
Even worse, in the view of Republicans who voted against the heartbeat bill, the state could end up paying the legal fees for groups that defend abortion.
""That is a big concern,"" McNally says. ""We don't want to put money in their pockets.""
The last time Tennessee had a case that went to the U.S. Supreme Court, it cost roughly $1.9 million. The experience was enough to give a few anti-abortion crusaders some pause. They voted this week with Democrats for a one-year delay on a heartbeat bill, vowing to study the issue over the summer.
Name-calling in Oklahoma
Even if it doesn't result in a case that upends abortion law, heavily Republican legislatures like Oklahoma's want to be ready.
The Two-Way Oklahoma Lawmakers Pass Bill That Makes Performing An Abortion A Felony ""If Roe v. Wade ever gets overturned, we won't be prepared,"" Republican Senate President Pro Tempore Greg Treat said while explaining his ""trigger bill"" at a committee hearing in February.
Treat's legislation, modeled after existing laws in a handful of states , would ""trigger"" a state ban on abortion and make it a felony if Roe were overturned. A handful of states, including Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota, already have trigger laws on the books.
Oklahoma has some of the strictest abortion laws in the nation, such as mandatory counseling and a 72-hour waiting period. But the most conservative anti-abortion activists in the state want more immediate action. So they targeted Treat and other self-described ""pro-life"" Republicans with protests, billboards and fliers, accusing them of not being anti-abortion enough.
""I've been called every name in the book these past few weeks,"" Treat says. ""I've had my Christianity questioned. I've had a member of my own caucus hold a press conference and call me a hypocrite.""
In response, Treat abandoned the trigger bill.
Now he is trying something else — an amendment to the Oklahoma Constitution that would reinforce that nothing in state law ""secures or protects"" the right to abortion. But that's still not anti-abortion enough for some.
""It's going to add on to that legacy that we have of death and just status quo pro-life policy that does nothing,"" says Republican state Sen. Joseph Silk.
Not far enough in Georgia
National Georgia's 'Uneasy Truce' On Abortion Ends In Georgia, a heartbeat bill passed the Legislature but is paused at Gov. Brian Kemp's desk. Supporters of abortion rights don't want him to sign it , of course, but some anti-abortion activists aren't happy either.
""It really just does not go far enough in the protection of innocent human life,"" says Zemmie Fleck, the executive director of Georgia Right to Life. Fleck argues that certain exceptions in his state's bill — for abortions after rape or incest if the woman makes a police report — make it weak.
Kemp has until May 12 to sign or veto the measure.
Cost as no object in Kentucky
The American Civil Liberties Union in Kentucky sued the day after a heartbeat bill was signed into law by Gov. Matt Bevin. But even during his annual speech to the Kentucky Legislature in February, Bevin acknowledged his intent to challenge Roe v. Wade.
""Some of these will go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. But at the end of the day, we will prevail because we stand on the side of right and we stand on the side of life,"" Bevin said.
Kentucky has become accustomed to defending abortion restrictions in court. Currently, one law that makes it a felony for a doctor to perform a common abortion in the second trimester has been suspended indefinitely.
It is unclear how much it costs Kentucky to defend abortion laws that are immediately challenged. In an emailed statement, Bevin administration spokesman Woody Maglinger writes that the state is using in-house lawyers and hasn't hired outside counsel. He declines to provide a cost estimate on hours spent on these cases.
""It is impossible to place a price tag on human lives,"" Maglinger writes."

FAA Officials To Meet With Airlines And Pilots To Discuss Boeing 737 Max,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712631724/faa-officials-to-meet-with-airlines-and-pilots-to-discuss-boeing-737-max?station=KXJZ_FM,"Boeing says it's close to finishing a software update for its troubled 737 Max aircraft. This comes as the company is trying to win back public and government support of the grounded fleet.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Here in Washington today the Federal Aviation Administration is going to meet with airlines and pilots to talk about the troubled Boeing 737 Max airplanes. The planes are still grounded worldwide after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed almost 350 people. As NPR's Russell Lewis reports, these talks come as Boeing says it's close to finishing a software update that may allow the jets to start flying again.
RUSSELL LEWIS, BYLINE: When the 737 Max entered service in 2017, it had a new safety feature. The plane would sense if it was close to entering an aerodynamic stall and force the jet's nose down. But it would do it without any commands from the pilots. That software, called MCAS, played a part in the two accidents. Dennis Tajer flies the 737 for American Airlines and is a spokesman of the Allied Pilots Association.
DENNIS TAJER: We believed it was manageable, but you had to know what was going on. But we're learning more, since the Ethiopian crash, about just how aggressive this system was.
LEWIS: Pilots of both doomed airplanes struggled to pull up before crashing. In a simulated flight of a different version of the 737, a crew demonstrates how difficult it is to control an aircraft when it wants to fly pitched down.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: We're at 300 knots now, fighting. And I am struggling to keep this aircraft flying.
LEWIS: The pilots in this simulation wrestled the plane for several minutes before they eventually gained control. Boeing says it has reprogrammed software on the 737 Max to prevent it from using erroneous data to trigger the MCAS anti-stall system. Here's CEO Dennis Muilenberg speaking yesterday.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DENNIS MUILENBURG: We're taking a comprehensive, disciplined approach and taking the time to make sure that we get it right.
LEWIS: Muilenberg says the company's test pilots have flown 96 flights with this updated software, and more are scheduled in the next few weeks.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MUILENBURG: Yet we know we can always be better. And these recent accidents have intensified our commitment to continuous improvement as we design, build and support the safest airplanes in the sky.
LEWIS: That may be a long process. Neera Jain teaches mechanical engineering at Purdue University. She's not involved with the software redesign. But says Boeing's challenge is it needs to re-engineer its systems so pilots can have confidence and trust in the plane's automation.
NEERA JAIN: We have to do a better and better job of then figuring out how to design those systems in a new way so that they don't just technically do the correct things but that they are also, for lack of a better word, then being transparent to the human. And that's a piece that I think - this is certainly a strong signal that there's a lot more that we have to do.
LEWIS: The FAA's meeting today is with executives and pilots of the three U.S. airlines that fly the 737 Max - Southwest, United and American. The agency says it wants to hear their concerns before it decides when to return the Max to service.

State Department Tried To Dissuade WikiLeaks From Posting U.S. Documents,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712631083/state-department-tried-to-dissuade-wikileaks-from-posting-u-s-documents?station=KXJZ_FM,"In 2010, WikiLeaks posted 250,000 leaked U.S. diplomatic cables. David Greene talks to Harold Koh, the then-legal adviser to the State Department who urged the organization not to publish them.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
All right. And let's go back in that timeline now to November 2010. The publication of 200,000 secret U.S. government documents was imminent. The then-legal adviser at the State Department sent a letter to Julian Assange and his attorney. It said, this release would harm lives, and it asked Assange to stop the publication. The author of that letter is Harold Koh. And he joins us on the phone this morning.
Mr. Koh, thanks for taking the time.
HAROLD KOH: Good to be here.
GREENE: So it sounds like the State Department was scrambling as WikiLeaks was ready to release all of these cables. Can you take me inside? What was happening?
KOH: Well, the cables - many of the cables indicate information that's threatening to human rights activists. You often have cables that say that an embassy official met with somebody in hiding - who is hiding from authorities, and this is what happened.
The request was made to Assange to redact this material so these lives could be protected. He and his colleagues were pretty much contemptuous of this and said, well, you know, let the chips fall where they may.
And so in the couple of days before the release, there was a mad scramble to try to get to all these people and move them. It was an extraordinary performance by dozens or maybe hundreds of State Department officials around the world.
Anyway, we know of nobody who got hurt as a result of the release. But when the release occurred, Assange said, see, no problem. In fact, he was the one who put them in jeopardy, and the State Department people were the ones who saved them.
GREENE: But as I understand it, didn't Assange actually reach out to you saying, give me the names of people who could really be hurt here? Why didn't you take him up on his offer to give him some names of people who were truly at risk?
KOH: I don't think that's actually what happened. The main point here was we quickly realized we were not negotiating with The New York Times or people who had high journalistic standards. And so as a result, we - there were some negotiations back and forth. And they were pretty high-handed about it, which is - we have no notion that there is any valid confidentiality interest in any of these documents. We're just going to dump them out there.
GREENE: But did Assange reach out? I mean, did you feel like there was an opening to talk to him about certain names and protect them?
KOH: There was pretty limited discussion. I think it was through his lawyers largely.
GREENE: I guess I just wonder, wasn't that an opportunity to find a balance? I mean, to protect lives but also protect press freedom, which is something that, you know, the State Department promotes so passionately in other countries.
KOH: I mean, we requested that. It was he who rejected it.
GREENE: And you didn't see an opening to explore it further - I mean, you had become convinced that Julian Assange and WikiLeaks - I mean, in your mind, was not legitimate as a media organization.
KOH: They weren't interested in negotiating. They were interested in revealing. And they were just going to say, we'll do it in the next hour, you know. We'll do it tomorrow if you don't - they weren't actually negotiating with us. And, you know, they'd received documents through some method of cyber intrusion, which we later learned more about.
So as soon as this release occurred, everybody had to go through every single cable that had been sent to see if there was anything there that we would have to then discuss with our foreign government allies so as to try to smooth over relations.
I mean, just imagine if all of your emails of the last year were suddenly put out onto the Web. You'd have to - at a time in which you have other work to do, you have to go back and look at all your old emails to see whether you've inadvertently insulted someone by saying something...
GREENE: Although to be fair, I mean, I don't work in government. Isn't it the point that people who are working on taxpayer money in government - I mean, that all the work you're doing on work emails is stuff that could at some point be made public and available?
KOH: Well, not classified emails. I mean, the classified emails are classified for a reason. And you generate information based on notions of confidentiality. I mean, if you're doing something under what you believe to be is a journalistic privilege, you tell somebody the name of sources that you wouldn't tell otherwise. And your hope and assumption was that it would be protected.
You know, like, I'm all for transparency. I favor transparency. But there are legitimate confidentiality interests that every organization has to respect or they can't do their job. And, you know, if you have somebody like The New York Times or The Washington Post who understands that idea and is ready to figure out a solution and discuss it, that's one thing. But Assange was in a very, very different place.
GREENE: Harold Koh was legal adviser to the State Department. He is now a professor at Yale University.
Thank you so much.
KOH: Thank you.

We have a timeline of key disclosures.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
So Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is in British custody and facing charges in the United States. And we're going to look this morning at the timeline that brought us here and also at some of the impact Assange has had on U.S. diplomacy and national security. I want to begin with NPR national security correspondent David Welna. Good morning, David.
DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: Good morning, David.
GREENE: So look back for me. When did the U.S. government actually begin to take notice of WikiLeaks?
WELNA: Well, I'm sure it noticed WikiLeaks 12 years ago, when WikiLeaks posted a U.S. Army manual of standard operating procedures for soldiers who were guarding hundreds of al-Qaida suspects in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But it was 2010 when WikiLeaks really got a lot of attention. That's when it posted a leaked U.S. military video that was shot from an Apache helicopter gunship, and it showed an air attack on more than a dozen people on the ground in Iraq who were clearly not fighting back. And among those killed were two men who worked for the Reuters News Agency.
And that same year, the military court-martialed an Army private - known then as Bradley Manning, who is now known as Chelsea Manning - who was charged with downloading to a personal computer that video and hundreds of thousands more military and diplomatic documents.
GREENE: Well, wasn't that also around the same time that Assange himself was accused of sexual assault and rape in Sweden? And did those accusations slow down the operations at WikiLeaks at all?
WELNA: Yeah, Assange was questioned by police in Stockholm about these sexual assault allegations, which he denied. But that's when the somewhat shining image of Assange in the eyes of some really started to tarnish. And yet, while all that was unfolding, WikiLeaks continued posting hundreds of thousands of previously secret military documents about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
GREENE: And then, of course, we come to 2016 and WikiLeaks, you know, being part of the story of the 2016 presidential election.
WELNA: Right. It was, and WikiLeaks posted some 20,000 emails from leaders of the Democratic National Committee in July of 2016, right around the time of the conventions. And that was a development that Donald Trump, who was then the Republican presidential nominee, cheered.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DONALD TRUMP: WikiLeaks - I love WikiLeaks.
WELNA: And Assange, shortly after that, denied to you, on our air, that Russia was the source of those leaked emails. And then WikiLeaks, a few months later, dumped more documents right before the election from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager. And that's something that she thinks may have contributed to her loss to Trump.
GREENE: All right, a reminder of the timeline here and WikiLeaks and some of the impact. That's NPR national security correspondent David Welna.
David, thank you so much.
WELNA: You're quite welcome, David.

How The Insurance Industry Helps Police Departments Tackle Bad Behavior,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606977/how-the-insurance-industry-is-helping-police-departments-tackle-bad-behavior?station=KXJZ_FM,"Bad policing can get expensive when it leads to lawsuits and settlements. For smaller cities, that can lead to serious pressure to change things from the people who help foot the bill: insurers.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
As conversations continue around the country about how police engage with the communities they serve, we've got a story this morning about an often-overlooked industry helping some police departments tackle bad behavior. Karen Duffin from our Planet Money podcast has the story.
KAREN DUFFIN, BYLINE: It was about five years ago. Tony Miranda was brought in as the new police chief in Irwindale, Calif. Fourteen hundred residents, it's a really nice little town - with one caveat.
TONY MIRANDA: The city was known for the police department because it garnered the most news. News at 6, news at 5, news at 11 - all negative.
DUFFIN: Police officers there had been accused of, or removed for, sexual assault, embezzlement and sex with a minor. So Miranda needs to make a lot of changes. He sees that there's tons of infighting. Lots of things have been neglected - training, basic technology. Like the program they use to send cops on 911 calls - theirs is broken. And when Miranda asks them, like, how do you guys even figure out where to go then?
MIRANDA: And one of the patrolmen holds up his palm and he says - like this, Chief. He's writing the calls on his palm of his hand with his ink pen.
DUFFIN: So Miranda tells his officers, I'm bringing in new blood. I'm going to hire a new No. 2.
MIRANDA: And one sergeant stands up and says, you know what, Chief? They're going to call for a vote of no confidence.
DUFFIN: Right off the bat, they tried to get him fired. And this may have been where the story ended, but Miranda had a powerful ally on his side - insurance. All those scandals had cost millions of dollars in legal fees, and insurance had been picking up most of the bill. But then their insurer told them - if you don't shape up, we're going to cancel your policy.
MIRANDA: An exterior threat that could close the Irwindale Police Department down.
DUFFIN: Without insurance, one big lawsuit could be enough to bankrupt a small town. So some towns have even shut down their police departments after they lost their insurance. John Rappaport at the University of Chicago studies police reform.
JOHN RAPPAPORT: There's a whole big, powerful, well-financed industry that is trying to influence police behavior.
DUFFIN: Big cities tend to self-insure, but smaller cities, like Irwindale, they buy either private insurance or join what's called a municipal risk pool - a sort of government insurance. In the mix of what can be a heated debate over police reform, insurers approach it as a business decision. Does this police behavior create risk? If yes, let's reduce it.
RAPPAPORT: We're not telling you you're bad. We're just telling you that your numbers are worse than they were last year, and we want to bring them back down to where they were.
DUFFIN: In Irwindale, their insurance authority gave them eight things to fix and 18 months to fix them. Miranda again.
MIRANDA: So they needed to either get a handle on things or cancel their policy. That was it.
DUFFIN: Which was motivating. There were trainings, new policies. They fixed their broken equipment. Tony Miranda got to hire that No. 2. And insurance isn't a cure-all for all bad police behavior. Insurers care mostly about expensive problems that might generate large payouts like excessive force. But pressure from the insurance authority worked for Irwindale. Eighteen months later, their insurance declared them new and improved - let them keep their insurance.
MIRANDA: I have to say, without that, I'm not sure if Irwindale would be here today. I'm really not sure.

Americans Are Divided Over Whether Transgender People Should Be In The Military,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712607012/americans-are-divided-over-whether-transgender-people-should-be-in-the-military?station=KXJZ_FM,"The Pentagon is set to enforce a policy Friday banning transgender people from serving in the military. David Greene talks to Delton Daigle of the Schar School of Policy and Government about his poll.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The Pentagon, today, will begin enforcing a new policy that effectively bans transgender people from joining the military. Transgender people already serving will not be affected, like Army Captain Alivia Stehlik. She told us the new restrictions don't reflect what's happening on the ground.
ALIVIA STEHLIK: You know, I just got back from Afghanistan. There is already no question about whether we can serve with distinction in all areas of the world, in all austere environments. But in the meantime, it's going to be a struggle for us to continue. We're going to continue to fight this fight to allow everyone to be able to serve openly.
GREENE: Now, polls show Americans are divided on this issue. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in February shows nearly 60 percent of Americans support transgender people serving. Another poll of current and former military members shows more than 60 percent are opposed. Political scientist Delton Daigle of George Mason University took that survey, along with Smithsonian Magazine and the military newspaper Stars and Stripes.
DELTON DAIGLE: The one that we took, you know, clearly was very focused on the military community. And even while we have a number of civilians - that might be contractors or family members of service members - generally, we would still find them less supportive than as was found in the Ipsos poll.
However, there are differences even within our own poll if we just separate it into those who had served in the military and those who had not. About 53 percent of our non-military respondents were supportive of transgender in the military, compared to about 39 percent of those who had or are currently serving in the military.
GREENE: What was the average age of your polling? I mean, are we talking about a lot of veterans or are there a lot of younger people who might be in the military now?
DAIGLE: The average age in our survey was 62 years old.
GREENE: Oh, I see. So it's an older group.
DAIGLE: It is absolutely an older group.
GREENE: The White House cites concerns, saying that allowing more transgender people in the military would negatively affect unit cohesion. I just wonder, you know, given some of the facts you're telling me about your polling sample - I mean, that there are a lot of older people, a lot of veterans. I mean, can we draw any conclusions about something like that from your data?
DAIGLE: So when you look at the data and you look at support for transgender in the military, it increases the younger people get. In fact, for every 10 years younger, you could think of support increasing by about 3 percent. So the difference between a 70-year-old and a 20-year-old within our sample is about a 15-point difference in their support for transgender in the military.
So the perception of cohesion - or the perception of the risk to cohesion decreases with younger people. So people who are actively serving in the military today, I would infer, you know, are less likely to see it as a problem.
GREENE: And your poll actually asked respondents to write some explanations for their answers. What kinds of things did they write down?
DAIGLE: There are a number of responses that kind of pick up on the buzzwords that the media are using, particularly, you know, the right-wing media, who've been using words like social experiment or social engineering. But there are a number of tangential ones that also kind of might not directly refer to LGBTQ communities or, you know, this particular issue. But you could probably infer that they might be kind of getting at that.
For example, a retired military member said standards drop in order to ensure political correctness, you know, or becoming too soft and overly concerned about hurt feelings and political correctness. So there are a number of responses where you can kind of guess that, you know, today's military and its shifting culture might be having an impact. And, you know, this is probably captured within this broader shift in culture.
GREENE: Delton Daigle is a political scientist at George Mason University Schar School of Public Policy and Government. Thanks so much for joining us.
DAIGLE: Oh, thank you for having me.

Buttigieg Says Success As South Bend's Mayor Prepared Him To Be President,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712607029/buttigieg-says-success-as-south-bends-mayor-prepared-him-to-be-president?station=KXJZ_FM,"As the mayor of South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg says he can bridge the divide between progressives and ""red state"" voters. He is expected to announce he's running for president this weekend.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Pete Buttigieg is expected to officially announce that he is running for president on Sunday. On the campaign trail, Mayor Pete often makes the case that his time as mayor of South Bend, Ind., has prepared him to be president. He said so on this program back in January.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
PETE BUTTIGIEG: We transformed the trajectory of our city. This is a community that was written off as dying at the beginning of this decade. Now it's growing again.
GREENE: Jennifer Weingart from member station WVPE takes a look at just how true that is.
JENNIFER WEINGART, BYLINE: The reality of Pete Buttigieg's South Bend depends on who you are.
JAKE MITCHELL: There is a definite difference in how it used to be versus how it is now.
WEINGART: That's Buttigieg's high school classmate Jake Mitchell.
MITCHELL: It's kind of an intangible feeling. You know, everything seems nicer, cleaner.
WEINGART: Buttigieg was 29 when he was first elected mayor. He was easily re-elected in 2015, but his policies have made some in this once-industrial city feel left out. Lisa DeBerry is a community activist.
LISA DEBERRY: So you've done a lot for downtown, and you're building hotels and apartments that people who are native to this town can't even afford, even the people with college degrees. So it's like, who are you developing that for?
WEINGART: Early in his first term, Buttigieg set a goal to knock down a thousand blighted houses in a thousand days, which the city met. Jack Colwell is a longtime columnist for the South Bend Tribune.
JACK COLWELL: And that certainly helped neighborhoods where there had been these vacant houses. They were drug houses, and gangs use them. There were eyesores.
WEINGART: Most of those neighborhoods are historically minority and lower income. And when the houses started coming down, people like Regina Williams-Preston became politically engaged.
REGINA WILLIAMS-PRESTON: Well, the people rose up and said, hey, we need help out here. Don't knock down our communities. Give us assistance. Give us help. It's our tax dollars. Invest in us.
WEINGART: She's a teacher and a city council member who's running to replace Buttigieg as the mayor of South Bend. She says Buttigieg listened.
WILLIAMS-PRESTON: And that's when we got $2 million worth of investment in home repair and 2 million more dollars invested in new construction for affordable homes.
WEINGART: Another candidate for mayor is Jason Critchlow. He used to be the county Democratic Party chair. He says Buttigieg deserves some credit for turning the city around, but...
JASON CRITCHLOW: I think there is a feeling here that it's disingenuous to pretend that one person had solely to do with any of the progress made here in South Bend. I think there's been literally decades of public servants that have gotten us to where we are today.
WEINGART: Many locals here have always had a sense that South Bend was going to be a stepping stone for Buttigieg's career. But not everyone in South Bend supports his presidential ambitions, says Lisa DeBerry, especially those who were left behind by the city's growth.
DEBERRY: That's like a mother having her own children and not taking care of - and then wants foster children. It's like, no, we're not going to give you more.
WEINGART: Regina Williams-Preston hopes that if he becomes president, Buttigieg would take the lessons he learned in South Bend forward.
WILLIAMS-PRESTON: You could really be, like, the president of the United States one day. And it's up to us - like, the people of South Bend - to make sure you're ready for that task.
WEINGART: Buttigieg was an improbable mayor, and he's hoping that experience will land him in another improbable place - the White House. For NPR News, I'm Jennifer Weingart in South Bend.

Sanders' Presidential Campaign To Visit States That Helped Trump In 2016,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606998/sanders-presidential-campaign-to-visit-states-that-helped-trump-in-2016?station=KXJZ_FM,"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders kicks off a tour of key states that helped send Trump to the White House. Sanders is trying to convince Democratic voters that he's the best candidate to defeat Trump.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
All right. Today, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is beginning a four-day tour of the key states that helped put President Trump in the White House in 2016. Sanders is campaigning in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, among other states. As NPR's Scott Detrow reports, this is the latest step Sanders is taking to try and convince Democratic voters that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Trump in 2020.
SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Bernie Sanders' campaign manager thinks the increasingly crowded Democratic presidential primary will revolve around two key questions. The first, says Faiz Shakir, is which candidate can best deliver all the changes Democratic voters want? He thinks Sanders is in good shape on that front.
FAIZ SHAKIR: However, I think we have some convincing to do about the case that we are the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump as well.
DETROW: That's despite the fact that Sanders is near the top of the 18-candidate pack when it comes to both fundraising and early poll numbers. A big reason why Shakir thinks Sanders needs to make his case on electability - the perception that Sanders may just be too liberal, too extreme for many voters. That's especially true going into an election where Trump and Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will paint Democrats as socialists.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MITCH MCCONNELL: I never thought in my lifetime we'd have a serious debate about the virtues of capitalism, and we're having that in this country right now. You add up things like - packing the Supreme Court, getting rid of the Electoral College, the Green New Deal and Medicare for none, and you have a prescription for turning America into something it never has been and never should be.
DETROW: Shakir says, as an actual democratic socialist, Sanders would be happy to have that debate. In fact, Shakir says a big focus of these Midwestern stops will be arguing that Sanders' platform could appeal to the voters in the three states that put Trump in the White House.
SHAKIR: He offered a bunch of rhetoric that I think was stolen right out of Bernie Sanders' language. He talked about draining the swamp, about saving Medicare and Social Security, about cutting fair-trade deals.
DETROW: It's not just Sanders who's focused on electability. A lot more than in past years, Democratic voters are saying that simply winning is more important than any single policy. Electability, of course, is a subjective thing, but the ability to win back Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin would probably fit into most Democrats' definition of it. Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke campaigned at Penn State University in the first week of his candidacy.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BETO O'ROURKE: We need to first show up with the humility of acknowledging that I don't know what's important to the Happy Valley - to the students at Penn State until I show up and listen to them.
DETROW: Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar made Wisconsin one of her first campaign stops. Democrats in those three states are welcoming the attention.
GWEN MOORE: I think lesson learned - that you really can't take Wisconsin for granted.
DETROW: That's Wisconsin Congresswoman Gwen Moore. But Moore makes the point that winning back Wisconsin and the rest of the crumbled blue wall goes far beyond the rural white voters that often get the most attention.
MOORE: You can't put all your money into trying to make sure that rural folks get your vote. African-Americans are just like any other voters, they need to be dealt into the game. They need to feel like there is something that they can gain from it as well.
DETROW: Courting black voters is something that Sanders struggled with in 2016, according to many primary exit polls. This time, he's making a point of focusing on racial disparities, like he did last week addressing Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BERNIE SANDERS: So when we talk about disparity, we are talking about the need for more black doctors, more black dentists, more black nurses, more black psychologists.
DETROW: In the year since the tense, bitter 2016 primary, Sanders' platform has been embraced by the mainstream of the Democratic Party. The question for many Democratic voters is whether it can be embraced by the middle of the country too. Scott Detrow, NPR News, Washington.

Good morning, I'm Rachel Martin. Time for a little spring cleaning - Switzerland may be taking it a little far. The country announced plans this week to take coffee out of its national pantry. For decades, it's had a national emergency stockpile of essential staples - sugar, rice and coffee, for example. The Swiss consume twice as much as the average American. Now, in a move that defies historic Swiss neutrality, the government says - and I quote - ""coffee is not essential for life."" We, the staff of MORNING EDITION, respectfully disagree.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
OK. Have you ever wondered what happens physically to people when they're in outer space? Like, what actually happens to their bodies? Scientists have shared results from NASA's twin study.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Yeah, for nearly a year, Scott Kelly lived at the International Space Station. Scientists compared samples from him and his earthbound twin brother, Mark.
MARTIN: I talked with Scott Kelly back in 2017, and I asked him about his health.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
SCOTT KELLY: You know, the symptomatic stuff is fine. I don't have any long-term negative feelings, physically, from being in space. Now, there's the things you can't feel. And hopefully, I will never learn that those are a problem.
GREENE: Those things you can't feel - well, it turns out they are as small as the protective structures at the ends of his chromosomes.
MARTIN: Yeah. These are called telomeres, and normally, they get shorter with age. But what about in space?
SUSAN BAILEY: What we wanted to do was evaluate telomere length in both of the twins before and after so that we could see, you know, where they started and then where they ended.
MARTIN: Susan Bailey was one of the scientists who answered this question. She expected the stresses of space to shorten telomeres quicker.
BAILEY: And, in fact, we saw exactly the opposite thing - that during spaceflight, he had many more long telomeres than he did before he went up. So that really couldn't have been more of a surprise to us.
GREENE: All right. Some other findings - Scott Kelly's gene expression changed, and his immune system went into high alert. His flu shot worked despite all the stress of space. Back on Earth, his body returned to normal within months.
MARTIN: Andrew Feinberg, another scientist who led part of this study, said this is a new chapter in tracking the effects of spaceflight.
ANDREW FEINBERG: I think that this study represents the dawn of the era of human genomics in space.
MARTIN: And the human body, or at least Scott Kelly's, seems pretty resilient.

Assange Faces U.S. Extradition After Years Holed Up In Ecuador's Embassy,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606991/assange-faces-u-s-extradition-after-years-holed-up-in-ecuadors-embassy?station=KXJZ_FM,"Rachel Martin talks to ex-prosecutor Renato Mariotti about the U.S. charging WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange with conspiring to commit computer intrusion. An extradition hearing is set for May 2.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Today, for the first time in almost seven years, Julian Assange did not wake up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. The co-founder of WikiLeaks is in police custody. A British judge has found him guilty of breaching the terms of his 2012 bail agreement.
Looming even larger, though, an extradition request by the United States, which wants Assange on one charge of conspiracy. So will Julian Assange ever sit in an American courtroom? We're joined now by former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti to work through that question. Renato, thanks for being back on the show.
RENATO MARIOTTI: Thank you.
MARTIN: Let's start with the charge. This is one count of conspiracy connected to the documents that former army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning leaked back in 2010, correct?
MARIOTTI: That's right.
MARTIN: And this is not a charge that he actually helped Chelsea Manning derive this information, it's that there was an attempt to do so. What sentence does that charge carry, that he attempted to help her break into sensitive government databases?
MARIOTTI: So the maximum statutory penalty is five years in prison. But ordinarily, ordinarily, I would expect that he would receive a sentence much below that. The X-factor here is that a judge has the obligation to consider all of the history and characteristics of Mr. Assange, as well as his other conduct. And the reality is, of course, that there are a lot of other reasons why Mr. Assange might receive a larger sentence and that could actually be up to the five years in prison.
MARTIN: What are the other reasons?
MARIOTTI: Well, for example, you know, the judge could consider harm that was caused by Mr. Assange is distribution of classified material. He might consider, or she might consider, the, you know, harm that was caused to the 2016 election.
So, you know, it's possible, for example, that, you know, prosecutors could present a wide variety of information about Mr. Assange that they would only have to prove by a preponderance of the evidence - in other words, by 51 percent - that would potentially sway a judge to increase the sentence but would not, itself, be the offense itself.
MARTIN: Which is interesting because this charge of conspiracy, it does not have anything to do with the WikiLeaks' dump of documents that had a negative effect on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. But you're saying it could affect a sentencing?
MARIOTTI: In fact, the judge would have to consider everything that he or she knew about Mr. Assange. And I'm sure the government would bring all of that to his or her attention.
MARTIN: First Amendment activists have been concerned that the United States might charge Assange with espionage because of the damage that was done by the release of those documents on national security grounds back in 2010. What does it tell you that that did not happen, that the charge was not espionage?
MARIOTTI: It tells me that the United States government was sensitive to that issue, either because they wanted to avoid a court challenge in the United States, or because they were concerned about the precedent that would set, or because the UK would not extradite purely for an offence of that type.
MARTIN: President Trump has had mixed messages about WikiLeaks, I think we can say. This is what the president said yesterday in the Oval Office when he was asked about the arrest of Julian Assange.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I know nothing about WikiLeaks, it's not my thing. And I know there is something having to do with Julian Assange. I've been seeing what's happened with Assange. And that will be a determination, I would imagine, mostly by the attorney general, who's doing an excellent job.
MARTIN: So saying he doesn't know anything about WikiLeaks. But during the 2016 presidential campaign, he heaped a whole lot of praise on the group.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: WikiLeaks, I love WikiLeaks. This WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable, it tells you the inner heart, you got to read it. It's been amazing what's coming out on WikiLeaks.
MARTIN: So the president, there, referring to what we were talking about - all those emails that were leaked from the DNC and John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. So I guess the question to you, Renato, is, legally speaking, how much could an Assange trial here in the U.S. reveal in the larger context of the Mueller investigation?
MARIOTTI: Yeah. I think that there's certainly the possibility that a Assange trial - particularly if the government added more charges - could reveal a lot of detail about Assange's activities. It's also possible that a sentencing of Mr. Assange will reveal a lot. Because, as I mentioned earlier, the government would have, in fact, an obligation - not just the right but an obligation - to inform the court of what they knew about Mr. Assange's activities.
So I think that there's definitely a prospect that all of us are going to learn a lot more about Julian Assange in the years to come, unless Mr. Assange cooperates with the government.
MARTIN: Do you think his extradition to the U.S. is inevitable?
MARIOTTI: I think it would be. It's very hard for me to imagine him not being extradited at this time.
MARTIN: Renato Mariotti is a former federal prosecutor and he joined us on Skype. Renato, thanks so much.
MARIOTTI: Thank you.

Sudan's Military To Oversee 2-Year Transition After President's Ouster,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712607022/sudans-military-to-oversee-2-year-transition-after-presidents-ouster?station=KXJZ_FM,"After nearly 30 years in power, Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir has been ousted and arrested. Rachel Martin talks to Sudanese activist Dalia El Roubi about this moment in the history of her country.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Sudan's dictator has been forcibly removed by his own military. It happened yesterday morning. Sudan's defense minister appeared on state TV in uniform and announced the news.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
AHMED AWAD IBN AUF: (Foreign language spoken).
MARTIN: He said President Omar al-Bashir was under arrest and that the Sudanese military would oversee a two-year transition period before holding elections. It's the end of an almost 30-year reign for al-Bashir. Dalia el Roubi is with us now from Sudan's capital, Khartoum. She is a member of one of Sudan's opposition parties and has been jailed for her activism against al-Bashir's government. Thank you so much for being with us.
DALIA EL ROUBI: Yes. Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: What is the mood in the capital city in particular? Are people clearly tempering their optimism?
EL ROUBI: I think the build-up yesterday to the announcement was filled with so much hope and commitment. And the streets were filled, waiting for the announcement of the defense minister. We were extremely disappointed to hear the announcement because it was, first of all, exemplary of how the regime has no respect for the values of our opinions and our rights, even with the change of Omar al-Bashir because, actually, in essence, we didn't just ask for him to go. We're asking for a whole system to go, and that change has to happen.
For us to be told, after all this time of protest and the best that have occurred - not just in the protest, but in the past 30 years by this regime - and to be told by someone who is actually blacklisted in the U.S. sanctions since 2007 because he was participating in the Darfur war - to be told by this very man that he is here to provide a transitional system or transitional government for the next two years - it's nothing close to what we are demanding.
MARTIN: So al-Bashir is gone, but now the military has stepped in. You say they're just an extension of him. So today, on this day of prayer, on this day of reflection, what is your hope? What happens now?
EL ROUBI: We keep standing, peacefully resisting. We have taken a huge step by getting rid of the head of the regime, but what we are dealing with is an Islamist movement. We have to understand that, as Muslims ourselves, we are fighting against an extreme form of the dictator that claims to be Muslim, and they are not.
We are coming back after 30 years, and the past six days has been a symbol of that. So on - upon reflection, the way forward is that we will continue in the sit-ins until the whole system is gone, the Islamic regime of the government is gone from all of it 'cause these people are a symbol of the brutality which we are against.
MARTIN: A particular woman got a lot of attention and headlines in recent days - became a symbol of the protesters - a young Sudanese woman who was wearing white, standing on a car in front of masses of protesters, reciting poetry. Can you tell us about her and why she became the symbol of the resistance?
EL ROUBI: I think that for us, Alaa Salah was a symbol of, two-thirds of the people in the protests are women. And you can see it. Anyone who's in the sit-ins or sees images - you know, you can see the presence of women of all ages and all backgrounds. What that image did was it kind of summed it up, you know? It was just the right image with the combination of even the woman looking at her and listening to her. The poetry that she has is quoted from a poem by an activist female.
So there was a lot of solidarity in that image. She really was an opportunity for us to really come together and realize that this is a symbol of something that represents all of these memories - you know? - and the symbolism around it.
MARTIN: Dalia El Roubi, a Sudanese opposition activist. She joined us on the line from Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. Dalia, thank you so much for your time.
EL ROUBI: Thank you.

Should We Have Empathy For Those We Hate?,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606984/should-we-have-empathy-for-those-we-hate?station=KXJZ_FM,"The latest episode of NPR's Podcast Invisibilia examines the history of empathy in American culture. In this era of political polarization, empathy has fallen out of fashion.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Empathy can seem like just what's needed in an age of deep polarization, right? But psychologists and neurologists are discovering that empathy can actually have a really dark side.
Here's Invisibilia co-host Hanna Rosin.
HANNA ROSIN, BYLINE: In 1977, a young psychology graduate student named Mark Davis was hunting around for a dissertation topic when he landed on a decent idea. At the time, people were very interested in the concept of empathy, but no one knew precisely how to define it yet.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: So Mark wrote up a list of statements to try and parse out its different dimensions. For example, question number two - read by my colleague from Hidden Brain, Parth Shah.
PARTH SHAH, BYLINE: I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me.
ROSIN: Empathic concern - feeling compassion for people in need. And another question...
SHAH: Before criticizing someone, I try to imagine how I would feel if I were in their place.
ROSIN: That measures perspective taking - imagining the world from someone else's point of view. A list of 28 questions - agree or disagree. And the list was a huge success - used thousands of times by researchers who were tracking the empathy levels of America's youth.
SHAH: I sometimes find it difficult to see things from the other guy's point of view. I sometimes don't feel very sorry for other people when they're having problems. I believe there are two sides to every question, and I try to look at them both. If I'm sure I'm right about something, I don't waste time listening to other people's arguments.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: Is this Sara?
SARA KONRATH: Mmm hmm.
ROSIN: Sara Konrath, a professor at the University of Indiana.
KONRATH: I study empathy and altruism.
ROSIN: In 2010, Sara had this idea that she would track down as many studies as she could find that used Mark's list and see if she could find any patterns.
KONRATH: But when I saw the picture - to just see this line declining over time, it was surprising.
ROSIN: A straight slide downwards, starting around 2000, in perspective taking and empathic concern.
KONRATH: We found a 40 percent decline in empathy.
ROSIN: 40 percent.
KONRATH: Yep.
ROSIN: Isn't that a lot?
KONRATH: It feels like a lot.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: What happened to empathy? - because in the '70s, when Mark made that list and when I was growing up, being empathic was something you 100 percent aspired to.
FRITZ BREITHAUPT: Absolutely. That's exactly how I grew up.
ROSIN: This is Fritz Breithaupt, a professor at the University of Indiana who wrote a book on empathy. After World War II, social scientists and psychologists started to push this concept of empathy into the culture. The idea was we were either headed for World War III or we were going to have to learn to see the world through each other's eyes.
BREITHAUPT: And that was always the idea - that had the Germans had had more empathy in the 1930s, Hitler would not have happened. The genocide would not have happened. Empathy was kind of seen as the hope against all of these kind of things.
ROSIN: In my elementary school in the '70s, we wrote letters to pretend Russian pen pals in order to teach us to open our hearts to our enemies. Empathy was also big with civil rights activists. The idea was that people with power and privilege were supposed to inhabit the realities of people without power, not from the safe noblesse, oblige distance of pity but from the inside.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: So when did you notice a skepticism about empathy start to creep in?
BREITHAUPT: What I noticed was, indeed - it happened in classrooms. It was students.
ROSIN: Over a decade ago, students just stopped buying the automatic logic of empathy. Like, why should they put themselves in the shoes of someone who was not them, much less someone they thought was harmful?
BREITHAUPT: The good purpose it serves is to empower people who feel victimized by certain other people to say, OK. It's important for me to step up against that - against abuse, about discrimination, about injustice. So...
ROSIN: So it's to refuse to have your strength sapped, essentially.
BREITHAUPT: Yes, exactly, by those other people.
ROSIN: The new rule for empathy is reserve it, not for your, quote, unquote, ""enemies"" but for the people you believe are hurt or you have decided need it the most - for your own team...
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: ...Which is a problem because here's the dirty secret about empathy. Lately, psychologists and neurologists have started to look at how empathy actually works in our brains. And one thing they found, says Fritz...
BREITHAUPT: One of the strongest triggers for human empathy is absolving some kind of conflict between two other parties.
ROSIN: The Super Bowl, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Kavanaugh hearings.
BREITHAUPT: But once they take the side, they're drawn into that perspective. And that leads to strong - very strong empathy and to strong polarization, where, suddenly, you only see this one side and not the other side any longer.
ROSIN: Researchers who study empathy have noticed that it's actually really hard to empathize with people who are different than you are. But set up a conflict, and people get into automatic empathy overdrive with their own team. This is a kind of dynamic that Fritz says might even be motivating terrorists.
BREITHAUPT: Some terrorists - it's not an complete absence of empathy that draws them in. But rather, it's an excess of empathy. They feel the pity. They feel the suffering of their people.
ROSIN: This is why Fritz called his new book ""The Dark Sides Of Empathy"" because there's a point at which empathy starts to look more like tribalism - a way to keep reinforcing your own point of view and blocking out any others. In my generation, we thought of empathy as the big, warm sun, lighting the path to peace for us all. Now it operates like a torch. You shine it on your friends and use it to burn your enemies.
What's the endgame of excluding some people from the possibility of empathy?
BREITHAUPT: Basically, you give up on civil society at that point. You give up on democracy because if you feed into this division more and you let it happen, it will become so strong that it becomes dangerous.
ROSIN: So why aren't you one of these people who say, I'm against empathy? Say the concept is so tainted - like, we've learned so much about it and how it works and how corrupting it can be that it's just not a useful concept.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
BREITHAUPT: I think that empathy still, overall, is the key to all humanity. Without empathy, we would be just alone. I mean, throwing that out would be - well, cutting out 90 percent of what our life is all about.
ROSIN: Empathy in its elemental, basic form - one person looking another in the eye and really seeing them. However we use it - for friends, for enemies - it's the substance that keeps us from spinning out into loneliness - the worst way of being, except for all the others.

"Trump Administration To Allow 2,700 Central American Children Into The U.S.",www.npr.org,Richard Gonzales,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712948933/trump-administration-to-allow-2-700-central-american-children-into-the-u-s,"Enlarge this image Ana Garcia (left) and her daughter Genesis Amaya of Valley Stream, N.Y., were reunited through the Central American Minors program in 2016 before President Trump terminated the program. Claudia Torrens/AP Claudia Torrens/AP Ana Garcia (left) and her daughter Genesis Amaya of Valley Stream, N.Y., were reunited through the Central American Minors program in 2016 before President Trump terminated the program.
Claudia Torrens/AP The Trump administration has agreed to settle a lawsuit with a dozen Central American families who challenged the government's cancellation of a program that was designed to reunite children in that region with their parents living in the U.S.
As a result, some 2,700 children living in Central America may be allowed to enter the U.S. at a time when the Trump administration is actively trying to dissuade other migrants from attempting to come to this country.
The program, called the Central American Minors program, was initiated during the Obama administration in 2014 in response to a surge of unaccompanied minors who sought to join their parents. Minors in Central America who had parents residing legally in the U.S. were eligible to apply for permanent residence as refugees, or for parole — a designation allowing someone to legally reside in the U.S. Over 1,335 minors arrived in the United States, according to a 2018 court order.
That order followed the Trump administration's termination of the program in August 2017. The government also rescinded parole for about 2,700 minors who already had been conditionally approved, but had not yet traveled to the U.S.
The International Refugee Assistance Project and the law firm Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP, filed suit on behalf of the families whose children essentially were in the pipeline when the administration canceled the program. The plaintiffs alleged that there was a "" secret shutdown "" of the program in the early days of the Trump administration, even as the government continued to solicit and accept funds from applicants to pay for medical examinations and travel to the U.S.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler ruled in December 2018 that the administration's mass revocation of the conditional approvals for the minors was illegal. In a March 1 ruling , she ordered the government to resume processing the children. But she did not compel the Department of Homeland Security to ""reach any particular outcome with respect to the processing of any individual beneficiary.""
Under the terms of the settlement, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service ""agrees to process the approximately 2,700 individuals who were conditionally approved for parole prior to the CAM Parole program's termination and then issued rescission notices, as well as any later born children who are classified as add-ons.""
According to a statement announcing the settlement, the International Refugee Assistance Project said, ""The government anticipates most applicants will be approved for parole and allowed to travel to the U.S.""
One plaintiff, identified in court documents only as ""S.A.,"" had applied on behalf of her daughter and grandchild.
""My heart jumps and cries for joy because there are so many who need to escape danger. I have faith that I will be together with my daughter and grandson soon,"" she said in the IRAP statement.
""We are so pleased that after many years apart our clients will finally have the opportunity to reunite with each other in safety,"" said IRAP Litigation Staff Attorney Linda Evarts.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to an email request for comment."
DEP to begin statewide sampling for six PFAS chemicals,stateimpact.npr.org,Jon Hurdle,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2019/04/12/dep-to-begin-statewide-sampling-for-six-pfas-chemicals/,"Energy. Environment. Economy. A reporting project of NPR member stations
The Horsham Air Guard Station in Bucks County, Pa. where the use of PFAS chemicals in firefighting foam has been linked with contamination of local water supplies. Jon Hurdle / StateImpact Pennsylvania April 12, 2019 | 05:02 PM Updated: April 12, 2019 | 7:42 pm DEP to begin statewide sampling for six PFAS chemicals Year-long program to focus on sources of likely contamination including military bases and airports Jon Hurdle Recent Stories Jon is an experienced journalist who has covered a wide range of general and business-news stories for national and local media in the U.S. and his native U.K. As a former Reuters reporter, he spent several years covering the early stages of Pennsylvania’s natural gas fracking boom and was one of the first national reporters to write about the effects of gas development on rural communities. Jon trained as a general news reporter with a British newspaper chain and later worked for several business-news organizations including Bloomberg News and Market News International, covering topics including economics, bonds, currencies and monetary policy. Since 2011, he has been a freelance writer, contributing Philadelphia-area news to The New York Times; covering economics for Market News, and writing stories on the environment and other subjects for a number of local outlets including StateImpact. He has written two travel guidebooks to the European Alps; lived in Australia, Switzerland, Israel, and Saudi Arabia, and visited many countries including Ethiopia, Peru, Taiwan, and New Zealand. Outside of work hours, Jon can be found running, birding, cooking, and, when weather permits, gardening in the back yard of a Philadelphia row home where he lives with his partner, Kate.
Pennsylvania environmental officials said on Friday they will soon begin testing for toxic PFAS chemicals in public water systems near likely sources of contamination including military bases, landfills and factories.
The Department of Environmental Protection said it will sample more than 300 water systems starting in May in a program that is due to last a year.
In a 66-page description of its sampling plan , the DEP’s Bureau of Safe Drinking Water said it aimed to identify known location and potential source of PFAS contamination across the state, assess the risk to drinking water sources, and select public water systems as a control group.
The bureau said it will test for six PFAS chemicals including PFOA and PFOS. It did not name specific locations for sampling but published state maps showing potential water sources for testing, and other places including industrial sites and airports. The map of potential water sources shows a concentration of sites in southeastern Pennsylvania including Lancaster, Berks, Lehigh, Chester, Montgomery, Bucks, Philadelphia and Delaware counties.
A full list of the sampling locations will be published when monitoring is complete, said DEP spokesman Neil Shader. He said the program will not be a comprehensive survey of all public water systems but a “representative sample” to determine the prevalence of PFAS chemicals.
Any system that exceeds the EPA’s health advisory limit will have to confirm its tests and to notify the public, Shader said.
PFAS chemicals have been found in the blood serum of 97 percent of the U.S. population, the plan description said, and in 38 U.S. states including Pennsylvania, although there is “limited occurrence data” in Pennsylvania.
The $250,000 initiative follows Pennsylvania’s announcement in February that it will begin to set its own health limits for PFOA and PFOS. The state announced its plan the day after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency did not commit to setting national limits as part of a long-awaited “Action Plan” to curb the chemicals.
“DEP will not hesitate to step up when the federal government fails to,” DEP Secretary Patrick McDonnell said in a statement.
In the absence of federal regulation, and amid rising public concern about the chemicals’ risk to public health, some states have set their own strict limits on the most commonly found PFAS chemicals. New Jersey last September became the first state to regulate PFNA, and has recently adopted tough standards on PFOA and PFOS.
Pennsylvania does not set its own limits for the chemicals — which are linked to health conditions including cancer, low birth weights, and elevated cholesterol – but relies on an EPA lifetime health advisory of 70 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOS and PFOA combined, a level that advocates say is much too lax to protect public health.
On April 15, the Wolf Administration is due to hold the latest public meeting of its PFAS Action Team, a panel of state officials who are charged with investigating the contamination and recommending cleanup strategies.
Some PFAS chemicals were used in consumer products like nonstick cookware and flame-retardant fabrics, starting in the 1940s. Although they are no longer made by U.S. manufacturers, they persist in many public and private water sources because they don’t break down in the environment.
The chemicals have also been used for decades in firefighting foam on military bases such as those near the eastern Pennsylvania town of Horsham, where water systems have been contaminated by PFAS chemicals. Local authorities there have taken their own measures to remove PFAS from water supplies, but local people are still concerned that the bases remain a source of contamination for groundwater.
Delaware Riverkeeper Network, an environmental group that has long campaigned for strict limits on the chemicals, welcomed DEP’s plans to investigate contamination but said the process is already later than it should have been and the plan means it will be two years or more before any maximum contaminant limits on the chemicals are in place.
“We need the sampling data as soon as it can be gathered and compiled so that we will not have to wait another year before DEP proposes maximum contaminant levels for PFAS compounds,” said DRN’s deputy director, Tracy Carluccio. “We needed action yesterday, not years from now.”
In January, the Navy canceled a plan to ship 4,500 tons of PFAS-contaminated soil from the former air station at Willow Grove near Horsham to a landfill in southern New Jersey. The landfill dropped its agreement to take the soil following media reports on the plan.
In 2013-15, the EPA tested for six PFAS chemicals in Pennsylvania as part of a national monitoring program. That sampling included Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, both of which were found to contain PFOA and PFOS below the EPA’s 70 ppt level. Explainers"
How Social Media Is Putting Z At An Advantage When It Comes To Jobs Gen : NPR,www.npr.org,Hafsa Quraishi,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/702555175/under-employers-gaze-gen-z-is-biting-its-tongue-on-social-media,"Keeping It Civil: How To Talk Politics Without Letting Things Turn Ugly
""Hiring is always kind of a judgment call,"" says Michelle Armer, the chief people officer at CareerBuilder. ""Employers are eager to find more information that will support the decision that they're making.""
Silmi realized the only way to beat those employers was not to leave social media completely, but to join their game.
From the ashes of her old account that detailed her youth, a new one arose: This account was public, too, but it depicted a professional persona that was lacking in the other account. She uses this new account to share credible news articles and the latest updates on her journalism career — with a few sports tweets scattered in between. Super excited to announce that I’ll be a part of this year’s class with the @nyt_institute ! #NYTSJI — Malak Silmi (@MalakSilmi) April 6, 2019
Silmi's generation grew up with social media. Generation Z, nicknamed ""iGen,"" is the post-millennial generation responsible for 'killing' Facebook and for the rise of TikTok .
Twitter went live in 2006, and Snapchat in 2011, when the older members of Gen Z were only 14. A lifetime of exposure, some experts say, actually makes them the most prepared generation for this kind of social media surveillance.
""In a sense, [Gen Zers] are actually in better positions than millennials who embrace a much more rigid social network, like Facebook,"" said Taylor Lorenz, an Internet culture reporter at The Atlantic . ""Because [Gen Z] has grown up with a lot of these platforms, they are cognizant of their image from the time that they're getting on social media.""
In fact, Lorenz notes, some children start thinking of their online presence in the third grade . Because of this awareness, they're very careful of curating their online branding. According to Colby Zintl, the vice president of external affairs for Common Sense Media, this opens up a need to teach youth about social media.
""We teach people to drive, how to have safe sex, and how to eat well: the Internet is just another one of those things that need to come with some instructions,"" said Zintl. Curricula like Common Sense Education's digital citizenship program are working to educate the younger generation on how to use social media, something the older generations were never taught.
Because of this extra education and hands-on learning, teenagers are often more savvy of these social platforms than the employers that are searching through them — it's just a matter of making social media work for them, rather than against them.
Some users are regularly cleaning up — ""re-curating"" — their online profiles. That can mean changing the people they follow and the things they post, or deleting old posts that no longer reflect a personal brand. Cleanup apps, like TweetDelete , exist to help during this process.
""There's an expectation right now that you have control over your own feed, because you do,"" said Lorenz. ""So you need to be constantly re-curating them.""
Gen Zers also use social media in more ephemeral ways than older generations — Snapchat stories that disappear after 24 hours, or Instagram posts that they archive a couple of months later.
Where Facebook is usually tied directly to a user's real name and identity, the personas on the platforms Gen Zers use, like Twitter and Instagram, can be altered and controlled. Gen Zers already use a multitude of strategies to make sure their online presence is visible only to who they want: They set their account to private, change their profile name or handle, even make completely separate ""fake"" accounts .
Armer of CareerBuilder still urges young people to post with caution at the outset, rather than relying on ways to clean up those feeds.
""I would be hesitant to put anything online that you wouldn't want a hiring manager to see,"" said Armer. ""If it's been on the Internet, it's never really gone."""

toggle caption Meg Anderson/NPR Patti Saylor says that after her son Ethan's death in 2013, she realized that police officers need more training in working with people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Meg Anderson/NPR Working with people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities, like Down syndrome or autism, can be complex and challenging even for those with years of training. But one group — law enforcement — often encounters people with these conditions in high-stress situations, with little or no training at all.
Patti Saylor knows all too well what the consequences of that can be.
Her son Ethan, who had Down syndrome, died after an encounter with law enforcement when he was 26. It's a tragedy she believes could have been prevented.
In January 2013, Ethan went to see the movie Zero Dark Thirty at a mall in Frederick County, Md. Afterward, when his support aide went to get the car, Ethan went back inside to try to see the movie a second time, but he didn't buy a new ticket.
Three off-duty sheriff's deputies, who were working as security guards, confronted him.
""He didn't cooperate, of course,"" Patti Saylor says. ""He didn't want to leave. At that point, I believe, he wouldn't know what was going on.""
According to a civil lawsuit filed by Ethan's parents, the deputies ""tried to drag him from the theater,"" and Ethan ""ended up on the floor with at least one deputy on top of him."" The deputies said Ethan was asked to leave before they took him by the arms. They denied any wrongdoing in the case, which reached a settlement last year .
There on the floor of the movie theater, Ethan stopped breathing. He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. His death, from asphyxia, was ruled a homicide . A Frederick County grand jury cleared the deputies of criminal charges.
Ever since, Patti Saylor has been fighting to change the way law enforcement personnel are trained when encountering people like Ethan. She says families like hers — with firsthand knowledge — have a unique perspective.
""We know something the police don't know,"" Patti Saylor says. ""I felt like we needed to teach them, and then hold them accountable.""

Meg Anderson/NPR ""It's not always resistance""
Ethan Saylor's death highlighted the lack of training many law enforcement officers have when it comes to people with intellectual or developmental disabilities.
Instead, much of their training revolves around how to gain and maintain control of a situation. Police training programs nationwide spend, on average, 168 hours teaching officers about use of force, weapons and defensive tactics, according to the most recent statistics from the Justice Department. That compares with only 10 hours spent on mental illness, for example. For that report, the government did not track the training time devoted to intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Police training often creates the mindset: ""I am the boss. You do what I tell you to do,"" says Seth Stoughton, a former police officer and now a University of South Carolina law professor who studies police regulation. ""And if someone doesn't do what I tell them to do, it is indicative of a potential threat.""
StoryCorps A Mother Of A Son With Autism Thanks A Stranger Who Helped: 'Nobody Does What You Do' Experts say people with intellectual disabilities may have trouble processing those orders. They may struggle to follow directions or manage emotions.
""It's not always noncompliance. It's not always resistance. Sometimes it's inability,"" Stoughton explains. ""The officer very often will perceive that inability as a refusal.""
Some police training addresses intellectual and developmental disabilities within what is known as crisis intervention training, which largely focuses on mental illness and substance abuse. At least 27 states and the District of Columbia require officers to be taught how to respond to someone with mental health or substance abuse issues, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Stoughton says the skills taught in those types of training — good communication skills, practicing patience, and earning a person's cooperation — may apply when responding to a person with an intellectual or developmental disability.
But, he says, the signs of a mental health crisis don't always apply to someone with this type of disability. Without specific training on these disabilities, he says, an officer might not recognize that they should adjust their behavior.
""Different tools to use on the street""
Six years after Ethan Saylor's death, Maryland has become a leader among states in requiring police training on how to respond to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
The Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commissions adopted the new requirements statewide in 2014. The next year, the state established the Ethan Saylor Alliance , which helps ensure that people with these types of disabilities play a central role in the training.
Two professors at Loyola University Maryland, Lisa Schoenbrodt and Leah Saal, developed one such training. With a state grant , they hired 10 adults with a range of disabilities to role-play common scenarios with police. Last fall, they piloted the class at Prince George's Community College.

Meg Anderson/NPR ""If we can provide a different perspective and give them different tools to use on the street, I just think that's great,"" says Percy Alston, the director of the college's Public Safety and Security Institute.
Alston is responsible for training new and experienced police officers on how responding to people with these disabilities might be different than what officers are used to. He cites one very basic example: A lot of police officers don't like to be touched.
""Once I put my uniform on, I'm like Superman; you can't touch my cape. But there are people with certain disabilities that do like to touch,"" Alston explains. ""So them touching you is not going to be an assault.""
On a Friday morning at the police academy, Alston leads about a dozen officers through the first half of the class, and then the Loyola trainers role-play with some of the officers. In one scenario, trainer Elaina Camacho, who has autism, played a daughter who threatens her mom. Officer Joseph Powell, who works with the Prince George's County public schools, calmed Camacho down by doing something unusual: He asked to play her video game while they talked.
Alston says that moment gets at the heart of what the class is all about. He knows that officers have to think fast and respond quickly, and they must protect their own safety. But when they encounter someone who has an intellectual or developmental disability, they may need to slow down and approach things in a different way.
Patti Saylor believes that could have made the difference for Ethan.
""So many police officers have asked me, what should they have done? And I said, 'Well, you've got to use your bag of tricks,' "" she says. In Ethan's case, ""if you really wanted him to leave, you may have said, 'let's go on out here and get a snack while we wait for your mother.' ""
""There's no magic pixie dust,"" she adds. ""It is relationship."""

That legislation was eventually thwarted in the Tennessee Senate, however, when some of his fellow Republicans voted it down, fearing the high cost of court challenges.
Sergio Martinez-Beltran/WPLN The new anti-abortion tilt of the U.S. Supreme Court has inspired some states to further restrict the procedure during the first trimester of pregnancy and move to outlaw abortion entirely if Roe v. Wade ever falls. But the rush to regulate has exposed division among groups and lawmakers who consider themselves staunch abortion opponents.
On Thursday, Ohio became the latest state to ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected . For a long time, Ohio Right to Life supported a more gradual approach to restrict the procedure and deemed what's come to be called a ""heartbeat bill"" too radical — until this year. Restricting abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected basically bans the procedure after six weeks' gestation — before many women know they're pregnant.
""We see the Court as being much more favorable to pro-life legislation than it has been in a generation,"" spokeswoman Jamieson Gordon says. ""So we figured this would be a good time to pursue the heartbeat bill as the next step in our incremental approach to end abortion-on-demand.""
The Ohio law contains no exception for pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest; it does have an exception for the life of the mother.
National A Bill Banning Most Abortions Becomes Law In Ohio National Activists Brace For 2019 Abortion-Rights Battles In The States Some say the rush to pass these bills is about lawmakers competing to get their particular state's law before the Supreme Court. The state that helps overturn Roe v. Wade would go down in history.
More than 250 bills restricting abortions have been filed in 41 states this year, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research and advocacy group.
""After the appointment of Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh, there really is just an environment in state legislatures to roll back abortion rights. And so we're seeing these bans just fly through,"" says Elizabeth Nash , who monitors state laws at Guttmacher.
But the speed of passage of some of these laws masks divisions about strategy and commitment to the cause within the anti-abortion movement.
Tennessee infighting over ""heartbeat bill""
In Tennessee, for instance, there's a philosophical split between pragmatists and idealists.
A heartbeat bill in the state has had high-profile support, including from the Tennessee's new governor. But the Republican attorney general warned such a law would be difficult to defend in court. And several Republicans, swayed by that logic, voted no for the heartbeat bill.
""This is an issue that is extremely important to me. It's the reason I got into politics many years ago,"" Republican state Rep. Bill Dunn said as the House approved the measure over his objection earlier this year. Dunn says he wants to stop abortion, but that will require strategy. He points out that no heartbeat bill has ever been enforced. And recent laws in Iowa and Kentucky have been immediately blocked in court. The same is expected for Ohio .
""Number one, it'll probably never save a life if we go by what's happened in the past,"" Dunn argued on the Tennessee House floor.
But it's money that ultimately stopped the heartbeat bill this year in Tennessee (It stalled in committee this week, though the state's Senate Judiciary Committee agreed to review the bill this summer.)
Law Federal Judge Blocks North Carolina Ban On Abortions Later Than 20 Weeks Senate Speaker Randy McNally says he's pro-life too, but has no interest in wasting tax dollars to make a point.
Even worse, in the view of Republicans who voted against the heartbeat bill, the state could end up paying the legal fees for groups that defend abortion.
""That is a big concern,"" McNally says. ""We don't want to put money in their pockets.
The last time Tennessee had a case that went to the U.S. Supreme Court, it cost roughly $1.9 million. The experience was enough to give a few anti-abortion crusaders some pause. They voted this week with Democrats for a one-year delay on a heartbeat bill, vowing to study the issue over the summer.
Name-calling in Oklahoma
Even if it doesn't result in a case that upends abortion law, heavily Republican legislatures like Oklahoma's want to be ready.
The Two-Way Oklahoma Lawmakers Pass Bill That Makes Performing An Abortion A Felony ""If Roe v. Wade ever gets overturned, we won't be prepared,"" Republican Senate Pro Tempore Greg Treat said while explaining his so-called ""trigger bill"" at a committee hearing in February.
Treat's legislation, modeled after existing laws in a handful of states , would ""trigger"" a state ban on abortion and make it a felony if Roe were overturned. A handful of states, including Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota, already have trigger laws on the books.
Oklahoma has some of the strictest abortion laws in the nation, such as mandatory counseling and a 72-hour waiting period. But the most conservative anti-abortion activists in the state want more immediate action. So they targeted Treat and other self-described pro-life Republicans with protests, billboards and fliers, accusing them of not being anti-abortion enough.
""I've been called every name in the book these past few weeks,"" Treat says. ""I've had my Christianity questioned. I've had a member of my own caucus hold a press conference and call me a hypocrite.""
In response, Treat abandoned the trigger bill.
Now he's trying something else — an amendment to the state constitution that would reinforce that nothing in Oklahoma law ""secures or protects"" the right to abortion. But that's still not anti-abortion enough for some.
""It's going to add on to that legacy that we have of death and just status quo pro-life policy that does nothing,"" says Republican state Sen. Justin Silk.
Not far enough in Georgia
National Georgia's 'Uneasy Truce' On Abortion Ends In Georgia, a heartbeat bill passed the legislature, but has paused at Gov. Brian Kemp's desk. Supporters of abortion rights don't want him to sign it , of course, but some anti-abortion activists aren't happy either.
""It really just does not go far enough in the protection of innocent human life,"" says Georgia Right to Life executive director Zemmie Fleck. Fleck argues that certain exceptions in his state's bill — for abortions after rape or incest if the woman makes a police report — make it weak.
Gov. Kemp has until May 12 to sign or veto the measure.
Cost as no object in Kentucky
The American Civil Liberties Union in Kentucky sued the day after a heartbeat bill was signed into law by Gov. Matt Bevin. But even during his annual speech to the Kentucky legislature in February, Bevin acknowledged his intent to challenge Roe v. Wade.
""Some of these will go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. But at the end of the day, we will prevail because we stand on the side of right and we stand on the side of life,"" Bevin said.
Kentucky has become accustomed to defending abortion restrictions in court. Currently, one law that makes it a felony for a doctor to perform a common abortion in the second trimester has been suspended indefinitely.
It is unclear how much it costs Kentucky to defend abortion laws that are immediately challenged. In an emailed statement, Bevin administration spokesman Woody Maglinger writes that the state is using in-house lawyers, and hasn't hired outside counsel. He declines to provide a cost estimate on hours spent on these cases.
""It is impossible to place a price tag on human lives,"" Maglinger writes.

A Guide To Talk About 'Game Of Thrones' Even If You've Never Seen An Episode,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862539/a-guide-to-talk-about-game-of-thrones-even-if-you-ve-never-seen-an-episode?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with David Chen and Vanity Fair's Joanna Robinson, co-hosts of the podcast A Cast of Kings, about how to talk about Game of Thrones even if you've never watched an episode.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
All right. Bad news for those stragglers out there - if you have not started watching ""Game Of Thrones"" yet, there are literally not enough hours left to catch up between now and the final season premiere on Sunday. But not to worry - we are here to help you pretend you know what's going on. We'll catch you up faster than you can say, ""Game Of Thrones"" is a show about a bunch of noble families on a fictional medieval continent battling for control while hordes of ice zombies march towards civilization. So here you go - a TV cheat sheet. Spoilers, of course, lie ahead. And here to help are David Chen and Joanna Robinson. They co-host the podcast A Cast of Kings. Hey, guys.
JOANNA ROBINSON: Hi.
DAVID CHEN: Hello.
CHANG: All right. So what is the state of play as we head into Season 8?
CHEN: So there's many players. And they all want a chance at sitting on the Iron Throne, which is the literal seat of power. It's where, like...
ROBINSON: Wait, Dave. Are you trying to tell me that this is a literal game of thrones? Is that what you're saying?
CHEN: It is a literal - it's literally a game of thrones, which is the name of the show.
CHANG: How clever.
ROBINSON: OK. The way that I like to explain it is to break it down into teams. So first of all, you've got Team Army of the Dead - literal zombies. They are invading from way up north. There's Team Targaryen. They're the ones with the dragons and led by a very cute and scary blonde lady. They're headed north to try to stop the army of the dead and to join up with our third team, Team Stark. They're the ones with the magical wolves. And they're led by a very cute and broody guy with curly, dark hair. And the last team is Team Lannister - mostly just one queen left on this team. She has no magical pets, unless you count her zombie bodyguard. She's sending her troops up north but not to help the army of the living. She's out for herself.
CHANG: So I think for some people, like for me at first, ""Game Of Thrones"" was kind of a turnoff because of all the fantasy, weird, fictional, medieval stuff. What ideas do you think this show gets at that might be interesting to people who are just not into dragons?
ROBINSON: I think if you go into ""Game Of Thrones"" thinking that you understand who's going to win, what a hero is, the beautiful thing that this story does is it just blows all of that out of the water. You're rooting for someone. And all of a sudden, they vanish off the game board. Or you write someone off as evil. And then they have this great moral growth.
CHANG: Yeah.
ROBINSON: So the fact that it's morally murky and complex in a way that - I think people dismiss fantasy as being too simplistic.
CHANG: So we've covered some of the basics. But now I want to get to some next-level stuff because if I want to sound smart and, like, fake my way through caring about what's going to happen to the bazillion characters on this show, I need some good questions to just kind of throw around. Give me some.
CHEN: Well, I think the one that everyone has been talking about is who is going to be the person who ends up sitting on the iron throne? You've got to kind of choose a side. And asking other people which side they're on is a good way to get a conversation started at a party.
ROBINSON: Yeah, that's my favorite question. I think if you want to sound, like, really smart and hipster at a party, when someone says, who do you think is going to sit on the Iron Throne? - you roll up and say, like, does the Iron Throne even matter anymore, really, in the grand scheme of things?
CHANG: (Laughter) All right. I'll use that one.
ROBINSON: I think that's a (laughter) good answer.
CHEN: I would say another question that a lot of people have is, who is going to survive until the end of the show. There's people who have, like, death pools going on or brackets of who's going to, like, make it to the end of the show.
CHANG: That's sunny.
CHEN: The show is so adept at killing off characters. People say between 2,000 and 150,000 deaths.
CHANG: That's quite a discrepancy you've just cited.
ROBINSON: That's what happens when you have a battle episode every single season.
CHANG: Oh, good point.
ROBINSON: You get a lot of bodies, you know?
CHANG: So this show launched, like, a thousand memes, right. What are some catchphrases I should know?
ROBINSON: What's been actually really helpful for spreading the popularity of ""Game Of Thrones"" is the fact that in this show, each of the houses, each of the families have their own, like, personal mottos and house words. So winter is coming is sort of the most famous one. And that's the House Stark house words, you could say.
CHANG: So, like, use winter is coming in context.
ROBINSON: I would say winter is coming if, like, prepare for the worst. Something bad is coming. You know what I mean? So if someone is moving in next door and it's not who you want, you just go, winter is coming next door.
(LAUGHTER)
CHANG: All right. So if I'm trying to decide, is it even worth bingeing at this point, how would you sell me on going for it?
ROBINSON: Maybe wait until it's all over.
CHANG: (Laughter).
ROBINSON: Well, you might want to find out if the ending feels worth it. I think when ""Lost"" ended and so many people were burned out on that ending, they were like, well, I'm just never going to catch up with this show.
CHANG: Such a great example.
ROBINSON: Thanks for saving me that time, you know? So...
CHEN: I have a pitch to make you, Ailsa.
CHANG: Uh-huh.
CHEN: There is no equal to this show in terms of popular culture right now. It's a show that everyone is talking about the day after it airs. There's something invigorating and fun about participating in a work of popular culture with millions of other people at the same time. And this show is one of the only ones that gives you that. And it might be one of the last ones that give you that.
CHANG: David Chen and Joanna Robinson are co-hosts of the podcast A Cast of Kings. Joanna also has two other ""Game Of Thrones"" podcasts - wow - and writes for Vanity Fair. Thank you to both of you.
ROBINSON: Thanks so much for having us.
CHEN: Thank you so much.

Bomb Cyclone Hits Central U.S. For 2nd Time In A Month,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862532/bomb-cyclone-hits-central-u-s-for-2nd-time-in-a-month?station=KXJZ_FM,"The central part of the country had heavy snow and strong winds Thursday. That storm system is now moving to the Great Lakes area. Power has been knocked out for tens of thousands of people.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
If you live in the central part of this country, you don't need us to tell you about the weather you're having. Starting in the Southwest and then spreading to the Great Lakes, wind and snow have been your daily companions, and many of you have lost power.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
This is the second bomb cyclone to hit the region in a month. In weather speak, the low strengthened as the system moved east.
DAVID ROTH: Which actually was the cause of a lot of the mischief.
SHAPIRO: David Roth is with the National Weather Service. He says although the system was not as bad as the March storm, the sudden drop in air pressure was severe.
ROTH: They recorded wind gusts across West Texas as high as 78 miles an hour. Last I heard, there were over 20 wildfires that have been caused by the system.
CHANG: KLBK photojournalist Larry Rodriguez in Lubbock, Texas, was driving around the city on assignment Wednesday when he pulled over to take a video of the dust storm.
LARRY RODRIGUEZ: Before the dust started kicking up, it was a very sunny day here. And then all of a sudden, this red-orange dust gets blown up into the sky. And you can still see the sun, but it's just orange. I've never been to Mars, but I would imagine that's what it would be like.
CHANG: Maybe some of that dirt showed up in a tweeted photo posted by Jennifer Everly in Minnesota. It shows the words Texas Dust written in dirty snow on the hood of a car.
SHAPIRO: In another part of Minnesota, the state patrol took a video of one of their troopers fighting the wind on an ice-covered road in the town of Lakefield. He slides sideways and finally succumbs falling to the ground.
CHANG: To the east, snowfall topped previous records in parts of Wisconsin.
HOPE KIRWAN, BYLINE: April always feels a little late for snow.
SHAPIRO: Hope Kerwan is a public radio reporter in southwestern Wisconsin. She pulled her car over in the town of Westby to talk to us. She says it wasn't just snow.
KIRWAN: On my commute in yesterday, there was thunder snow, where it's snowing but there's thunder and lightning. There were a lot of power outages because of the winds knocking over poles. I know a lot of communities around the La Crosse area were affected by that.
CHANG: All told, it was bad enough. But the second bomb cyclone could have been worse. For those folks along the Missouri River who got flooded after the last bomb cyclone, there's good news. The Weather Service says this storm is not expected to cause further flooding because the ground isn't frozen anymore.

PBS' 6-Episode 'Les Misérables' Miniseries Focuses On The Story Instead Of Music,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862525/pbs-6-episode-les-mis-rables-miniseries-focuses-on-the-story-instead-of-music?station=KXJZ_FM,"PBS premieres a new version of Victor Hugo's Les Misérables, starring Dominic West of The Wire and The Affair. This version has no music and tries to be closer to the source material.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Many people were introduced to the classic ""Les Miserables"" through the Tony Award-winning musical version.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, ""LES MISERABLES"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Look down. Look down. Don't look them in the eye.
CHANG: Well, a new six-episode miniseries of ""Les Mis"" debuts Sunday. And there's no music. PBS's ""Masterpiece"" instead focuses on the story. NPR TV critic Eric Deggans says he was surprised at how little he missed the music.
ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: This could sound like heresy to fans of the classic musical, but I love ""Les Miserables"" without the songs. At least, I love writer Andrew Davies and director Tom Shankland's music-less version of this story, which recreates the broad sweep of Victor Hugo's classic 1862 French novel with an epic, emotional treatment.
The show's power comes courtesy of its two leads - Dominic West, who plays convict-turned-hero Jean Valjean and David Oyelowo, who is Javert, the policeman who relentlessly hunts him down. Their first scenes together are electric, as Javert assures Valjean he's a convict because it's in his nature.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""LES MISERABLES"")
DAVID OYELOWO: (As Javert) I was born in prison. My parents were criminals. Men like us have only two choices - to prey on society or to guard it. You chose the former. I chose the latter.
DOMINIC WEST: (As Jean Valjean) Nineteen years for a loaf of bread.
OYELOWO: (As Javert) You've got 12 months left to serve. My guess, you'll be back in here before another year has gone by.
DEGGANS: It's interesting to see a black man play the ultimate cop given today's debates about over-policing people of color. But the central issue in ""Les Miserables"" centers on character. Are people inherently bad or do they simply make bad choices in desperate circumstances?
The story also suggests that love is the best response to tough times. West and the always excellent Derek Jacobi bring this point home while recreating a classic scene from the novel. A fresh out of prison Valjean is given a place to sleep by a Bishop played by Jacobi. The bishop challenges Valjean to love his fellow man despite his hard life.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""LES MISERABLES"")
WEST: (As Jean Valjean) How can I love my fellow man when he treats me worse than a dog? It's easy for you. You can afford to be kind and gentle.
DEREK JACOBI: (As Bishop Myriel) Absolutely right. It is easy for me. But consider this - even if the world has done you a great injustice, does it really serve you to have a heart full of bitterness and hatred?
DEGGANS: West is the lynchpin of this miniseries. As Valjean progresses from hardened ex-convict to an upstanding businessman with a fake identity, the actor remains compelling and believable. With a glance, West can reveal Valjean as a flawed man reaching towards redemption but often undone by impulsive decisions and the guilt of his past misdeeds.
Lily Collins is another delight as Fantine, a poor woman whose life is ruined by trusting the wrong people. When she falls in love with a wealthy young aristocrat who is romancing her, a friend warns her of that folly.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""LES MISERABLES"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) You have to remember, they're not serious, these types. They're just amusing themselves. The ground we walk on is not solid ground, Fantine. We could fall through any time. We could be down in the gutter and no one would care. Plenty more where we come from.
LILY COLLINS: (As Fantine Thibault) But why should it always be like that?
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Because it is.
DEGGANS: Fantine learns the hard way how right her friend is. That she pays such a heavy price when Valjean arguably makes worse mistakes and survives feels like a nod to the persistent inequality between the sexes. A co-production with the BBC, PBS's miniseries vividly recreates the crushing poverty and immense gaps between the lives of the wealthy and the poor in post-Napoleonic France.
This is why a new version of ""Les Miserables"" makes sense right now, as America and the world is already wrestling with tough questions centered on poverty, policing, wealth gaps and social justice. I'm Eric Deggans.

What Pope Benedict's Letter On The Sex Abuse Scandal Means For Catholics,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862518/what-pope-benedicts-letter-on-the-sex-abuse-scandal-means-for-catholics?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with Natalia Imperatori-Lee, associate professor of religious studies at Manhattan College, about Pope Benedict's letter about sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
It has been six years since Pope Benedict XVI became pope emeritus. Having two living men who lay claim to the title Pope, one retired and one active, has not happened in centuries. Nevertheless, that is the current state of play in the Roman Catholic Church, and there have been moments when the retired pope has stepped on the message of the current pope. Just this week, Benedict released a letter weighing in on the church's massive sex abuse scandal.
And to talk more about that letter and what it means for Catholics, we're joined now by Natalia Imperatori-Lee. She is associate professor of religious studies at Manhattan College. Welcome.
NATALIA IMPERATORI-LEE: Thank you very much for having me.
CHANG: So Benedict's letter is seen as controversial because of where he places blame for the church's sex abuse scandals. Can you tell us a little more about exactly what Benedict wrote?
IMPERATORI-LEE: So Pope Benedict wrote a letter that reflects kind of his ideas about what caused the scandal and what threatens the church, which is basically the sexual revolution then uprisings of the 1960s, a sort of libertarianism when it comes to morals and the departure of God from the public square.
CHANG: I mean, we should point out that, you know, it's highly unusual that he's even speaking up. He had originally said he would remain, ""hidden to the world"" - that's a direct quote. But that no longer seems to be the case. Do we know why he's jumping into the fray now?
IMPERATORI-LEE: No. I think it's most confusing why he would jump into the fray now, particularly with this intervention which, by referring to the sexual revolution or the 1960s, is really stuff that he had talked about while he was the pope. And so it's unclear why he or the people around him felt the need to weigh in once again with the sort of causes of the crisis that we already knew he believed.
CHANG: Right. I mean, how does Pope Benedict's letter conflict with what Pope Francis has said about the clergy abuse crisis?
IMPERATORI-LEE: Well, I think the main problem is that it doesn't mention victims at all. The hallmark of Francis' approach to the sexual abuse crisis has been that he has centered victims' voices. If you look at Benedict's letter, the victim in his letter is the church. And that's a real slap in the face to people who have survived sexual abuse.
CHANG: So what are the implications of this for Catholics? I mean, having two popes - one who is officially in power, one who is not - who are now saying different things about such a critical issue for the church?
IMPERATORI-LEE: Yeah. I don't want to overstate it. I don't think that anybody thinks that Benedict is still the pope. But I do worry that it flirts with a kind of divisiveness that is unhelpful. We all know that not everybody is supportive of Pope Francis centering the voice of victims or Pope Francis' approach to how he runs the church with openness. And so I worry that it encourages people who criticize Pope Francis into looking backward to the pope emeritus as their pontiff, or their shepherd or something like that, which is really dangerous to the unity of the church.
CHANG: Right. And where does that leave Vatican leadership? I mean, is it possible that this conflict between Benedict and Francis could cause a schism among the highest levels in the Vatican?
IMPERATORI-LEE: I don't think that it will. I think that the resistance to Pope Francis is small, even if sometimes it gets loud. I think that it's not even a conflict, probably, between the two men. I think that Francis holds Benedict in high esteem and values his opinion. It's just when that opinion spills out into the public that you have these competing visions, and then forcing Catholics to maybe choose a side is not exactly where we want the church to be.
CHANG: Natalia Imperatori-Lee. She's an associate professor of religious studies at Manhattan College. Thank you very much for joining us today.
IMPERATORI-LEE: Thank you so much.

Lobbyists See The Indictment Of Powerful Lawyer Gregory Craig As A Warning,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862511/lobbyists-see-the-indictment-of-powerful-lawyer-gregory-craig-as-a-warning?station=KXJZ_FM,"The indictment of lawyer and lobbyist Gregory Craig, a former Obama White House counsel, is sending a shockwave through the ranks of those who represent foreign entities.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
In Washington, lobbyists are reading this week's indictment of a powerful lawyer named Gregory Craig as a warning. Craig did some work for lobbyist Paul Manafort, President Trump's onetime campaign chairman who now faces a long prison sentence. NPR's Peter Overby reports.
PETER OVERBY, BYLINE: Gregory Craig was the top lawyer in President Barack Obama's White House. Before that, he was on the defense team for President Bill Clinton's impeachment. Right now Craig is an object lesson for lobbyists who deal with or should deal with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. It's commonly called FARA.
KATE BELINSKI: There really has been a sea change in how people are approaching FARA registration and really thinking and taking seriously whether they do need to register.
OVERBY: Kate Belinski is a lawyer who helps lobbyists navigate FARA's requirements. She said that since Craig's case became public a few weeks ago, she's been getting a lot of calls about whether and how to register.
BELINSKI: I wasn't getting those calls on a regular basis before.
OVERBY: FARA enforcement is up to the Justice Department. Before 2017, enforcement was extremely light. Then special counsel Robert Mueller's task force arrested Manafort, and Belinski said Congress now pays much closer attention.
BELINSKI: DOJ is at a point right now where they can't be in a position where they're not enforcing.
OVERBY: Toby Moffett, a longtime FARA registrant and former congressman, said that since Manafort's arrest...
TOBY MOFFETT: You hear a lot more people talk about it and speak with some fear about violating the statute possibly.
OVERBY: Moffett noted the fine already paid by Craig's former law firm, Skadden, Arps - $4.6 million.
MOFFETT: The Skadden experience has probably, to put it mildly, gotten the attention of other firms, especially law firms which are very reputation-conscious.
OVERBY: Senate Judiciary Chair Charles Grassley wants to change the lobbying laws. He would make lobbyists register under FARA if their clients are the U.S. subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies. Those subsidiaries currently come under the law for domestic lobbying, where disclosure is far less strict. Paul Miller is president of the Institute for Lobbying and Ethics, a lobbyist organization. He said FARA's stronger disclosure is good. But FARA has filing fees.
PAUL MILLER: But for small firms who do it, you know, it's just over $600 a year for the filing. And then the paperwork is a headache.
OVERBY: That would still leave open some big loopholes. People avoid both lobbying laws by calling themselves strategic advisers.
MILLER: It's not new. I mean, these things seem to be happening, and that's why we keep talking about, you know, the shadow lobbying.
OVERBY: There's also the risk of bad publicity. Tom Susman is a former lobbyist now with the American Bar Association.
TOM SUSMAN: Nobody wants to be part of the NPR story about having violated one of the federal laws when your job depends on your reputation and your credibility.
OVERBY: But those laws have proved tough to change. Peter Overby, NPR News, Washington.

Former WikiLeaks Employee Discusses Julian Assange's Arrest,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862504/former-wikileaks-employee-discusses-julian-assanges-arrest?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with James Ball, a former Wikileaks employee, about the recent arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The arrest of Julian Assange has renewed the debate, is the co-founder of WikiLeaks a journalist or a criminal? Yesterday on the program, we heard from one of his critics, former defense secretary and former CIA Director Leon Panetta.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
LEON PANETTA: If we care about classified information, if we care about what our intelligence people are doing, then I think it's important that we decide whether or not somebody has the right on his own to not only gather that kind of information but release it.
SHAPIRO: Now we're joined by someone who used to work with Julian Assange. James Ball is a journalist and former WikiLeaks employee speaking with us from a street corner in London. Hi there.
JAMES BALL: Hi there.
SHAPIRO: You argue that Assange is unlikable, that he is a difficult person but that it's still important to defend him. Why?
BALL: I should be specific on this. I think it's important to defend him against the U.S. extradition on the charge that he's currently facing. I think he deliberately breached due process in the U.K., and he is right to be punished for breach of bail there. What I don't think we should do it just because we don't like Julian Assange as a person or we don't like his journalistic ethics or maybe we don't even think he's a journalist - we shouldn't let that blind us to what looks at the moment like a politically motivated and dangerous prosecution.
SHAPIRO: He has described himself as a journalist. You're saying we may disapprove of his journalistic ethics, but we should still evaluate his actions on that basis. His critics will say that as opposed to exercising any kind of editorial judgment, he was just a tool for intelligence agencies, including those of Russia.
BALL: I think if someone has evidence that Assange was a knowing tool of the Russian state, then that's something that he should face prosecution for. But that is not the charge on the table. The charge on the table relates to material leaked by Chelsea Manning. She was an ideologically motivated whistleblower. The charge around Assange is that he offered some help in cracking a password that might have made it easier for her to hide her actions. There's actually no evidence that was even successful.
And so it doesn't change the fact that we're dealing with a public interest whistleblower. And the material that was published was judged to be in the public interest by The New York Times, by The Guardian, by Le Monde, by Der Spiegel and more.
SHAPIRO: If I as a journalist with NPR helped somebody who works for the Defense Department or the CIA or the NSA hack into a secure server or access classified documents, I would likely be prosecuted for that independent of what I might do as a journalist. Are you saying that shouldn't be the case?
BALL: I think we have to look at the proportionality of the prosecution. The allegation is that Assange sort of offered to help crack a password unsuccessfully that would have helped someone who was already leaking material not be discovered. That's the kind of mistake I could see someone not trained in journalism sort of doing in a close source relationship. I think 10 years after the fact, to try and pursue that for prosecution - you know, you don't have to be a cynic to see it as a backdoor way of trying to punish Assange for the 2010 disclosures while hiving off journalistic support because we can all call it hacking and say it's different to what we do.
SHAPIRO: It's clear that while you believe that prosecutors are making the wrong decision here, that doesn't make you a fan of Assange personally. What made you decide to go work for him and for WikiLeaks at a time when he had basically driven away everybody else who had worked with him prior to that?
BALL: I mean, I was a young guy. I was 24. Assange was quite inspiring to me. And it takes time, especially when you're at that age, to see the reality of someone versus the image or the icon. And I really believed in the mission of what WikiLeaks was trying to do - you know, responsible disclosure, holding power to account. And then of course when I saw the reality, I came to a much more nuanced fear of Julian, to say the least.
SHAPIRO: James Ball is a journalist in London who used to work for WikiLeaks. Thanks so much for speaking with us today.
BALL: Thanks very much - good to speak to you.
