"25 years after genocide, Rwanda's Kagame is praised, feared",www.foxnews.com,RODNEY MUHUMUZA,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/25-years-after-genocide-rwandas-kagame-is-praised-feared,"Kagame is so little-questioned that he speaks openly about the apparent assassinations of opponents. That fear factor keeps him in power, critics say, even as he embraces a global reputation as the man who helped bring an end to the mass killings of some 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus, and who has brought stability to the East African nation. In a speech last month, Kagame spoke dismissively of the crime that launched his reputation as a hard-liner: The 1998 killing of exiled opposition leader Seth Sendashonga, a fierce Kagame critic, who was gunned down in the streets of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.
Referring to the assassination, widely believed to have been carried out by a Rwandan hit squad at Kagame&apos;s orders, Kagame said he had little to say. ""But I am also not apologetic about it,"" he added.
It was vintage Kagame, who has been Rwanda&apos;s de facto leader since his rebel group seized power by force, ending the 100-day genocide that began on April 7, 1994. He has been president since 2000, and could rule until 2034 following changes to the constitution.
Now 61, Kagame shows no signs of giving up power.
A darling of the development community, Kagame is lauded by some as a driver of economic growth that has lifted many Rwandans from poverty, bringing improved health care and education. He has also pushed for more women in political office, and 64% of the lawmakers in Rwanda&apos;s parliament are women, the highest percentage of any country in the world.
But for many others he is the architect of an authoritarian regime that has stamped out virtually all opposition in Rwanda as opponents are jailed, flee, disappear, or are killed under mysterious circumstances.
""There is absolutely no room for dissent within Rwanda,"" said British writer Michela Wrong, who is researching a book on the country. ""You agree, you accept Kagame&apos;s supreme power, or you leave.""
Rights groups decry what they describe as rampant violations that include the arbitrary detentions of street children and other poor people as part of an unofficial government program to hide ""undesirable"" citizens from view, according to Human Rights Watch. Street vendors, many of them women, have been among the main targets, it said.
Civic groups, journalists, rights watchdogs and political opponents ""cannot operate independently or criticize government policy,"" Human Rights Watch said in its most recent assessment of conditions in Rwanda.
Amnesty International cited a ""climate of fear"" before Kagame was re-elected to a third term in 2017, a vote that the president described as ""a formality"" after the most serious challenger was prevented from running and later jailed.
Even government programs ostensibly aimed at forging national unity are criticized by opponents as tools to more tightly control society.
The U.S. State Department, which describes Rwanda as ""a constitutional republic dominated by a strong presidency,"" also cites the problem of impunity among civilian authorities and the security forces.
Still, Rwanda&apos;s government remains a major recipient of U.S. and other foreign aid despite persistent allegations of abuses — a fact that has been sharply criticized by Kagame&apos;s opponents. Some analysts have long noted that Western remorse over failure to stop the genocide allows Rwanda a measure of goodwill from benefactors who would act tougher with a similarly repressive regime.
Olivier Nduhungirehe, Rwanda&apos;s deputy minister of foreign affairs, told The Associated Press that those complaining about human rights ""should keep quiet,"" as Rwanda marks 25 years since the genocide.
""We can&apos;t say that everything is perfect, of course,"" he said, of concerns voiced by some exiles, who say they are afraid to return home. ""But reconciliation is a reality for the past 25 years.""
Some critics who have fallen out with the president, including senior ruling party members once seen as Kagame allies, have fled into exile, where safety isn&apos;t always guaranteed.
British police have warned two prominent Rwandan dissidents of the threats to their lives posed by Rwanda&apos;s government. Similar warnings have been issued to dissidents elsewhere in Europe.
In South Africa, an inquest continues into the death of former Rwandan spy chief and Kagame critic Patrick Karegeya, who was found strangled in a Johannesburg hotel in 2014. Kagame has denied his government had anything to do with the killing but warned that those who betray their country will ""pay the price.""
Jean-Marie Micombero, a former army major who broke with the Kagame government and who has lived in exile in Belgium since 2011, said that 25 years after Rwanda&apos;s genocide, the country has yet to truly heal from its violent past.
""Under Kagame&apos;s leadership Hutus and Tutsis are forced to live together,"" said Micombero, a Tutsi. He called for new leadership that would ""work in the areas of truth and justice in the context of a broken society. ... There cannot be reconciliation without truth and justice.""
One group in exile that is leading the opposition against Kagame includes former members of Rwanda&apos;s ruling party.
Outlawed in Rwanda as a terrorist group and accused of running rebel cells in eastern Congo, the Rwanda National Congress denies the allegations and says it is working toward ""a united, democratic, and prosperous nation inhabited by free citizens.""
The group&apos;s Johannesburg-based leader, former Rwandan army chief Gen. Kayumba Nyamwasa, has been the target of multiple assassination attempts that he blames on Kagame.
Rwanda&apos;s government dismisses charges it runs hit squads abroad. Nduhungirehe, the deputy foreign affairs minister, accused the Rwanda National Congress of ""walking hand in hand with those who committed genocide,"" something the group strongly denies.
But, says Wrong, the British author and journalist: ""The level of invective Kagame dedicates to the Rwanda National Congress, the amount of energy he has expended trying to get Uganda and South Africa to expel or extradite or close down these players, suggests he sees them as a real threat.""
""These individuals were once incredibly close to Kagame, they know exactly what makes him tick,"" Wrong said. ""I think it&apos;s a case of fearing no one quite so much as a former brother-in-arms.""

LONDON, ENGLAND - MARCH 12: Princess Beatrice of York and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi attend The Portrait Gala 2019 hosted by Dr. Nicholas Cullinan and Edward Enninful to raise funds for the National Portrait Gallery's 'Inspiring People' project at the National Portrait Gallery on March 12, 2019 in London, England. (Photo by David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images) After watching her younger sister marry last year, speculation is rife that Princess Beatrice is set to follow Eugenie down the aisle in a matter of months. Beatrice is said to be “head over heels in love” with property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, with the couple moving in together at St James’s Palace after just a few months of dating.

“I don’t know if he has actually got down on one knee with a ring yet but they are openly talking about marriage and it will either be later this year or possibly early in 2020,” a close friend told The Sun .
So just who is Edoardo and how did he and Beatrice meet?
THEY’RE FAMILY FRIENDS
According to People magazine , Edoardo, 34, is a friend of Beatrice’s family and the two have known each other for “many years.

Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson were close to Edoardo’s late stepfather Christopher Shale, who died suddenly at the 2011 Glastonbury rock festival.
According to The Sun , the two were reintroduced in September last year by mutual friends a month before Eugenie’s wedding to Jack Brooksbank.
PRINCESS EUGENIE SHARES ADORABLE THROWBACK PIC
Like Beatrice, Edoardo also comes from an aristocratic background — his father is Count Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi.
Beatrice had been single since her 2016 split from boyfriend Dave Clark, who she had dated for a decade.
Edoardo has a two-year-old son called Wolfie with his former fiancee Dara Huang.
WHAT DOES HE DO FOR A LIVING?
According to Town and Country , Edoardo is a multi-millionaire after founding real estate company Banda in 2007.
He still serves as its CEO, with the company focusing on discreetly finding and developing homes for its rich clients.
PRINCE WILLIAM WORKED UNDERCOVER WITH BRITISH SPIES
Edoardo frequently shares photos of his company’s work on his Instagram account, where he has more than 11,000 followers.
In addition to his work, Edoardo co-founded charity Cricket Builds Hope , which teaches Rwandans how to play cricket.

The charity aims to help use “the power of sport to promote reconciliation and tackle deep-seated social issues like gender inequality through specially tailored sessions” of cricket.
WHEN DID THEY CONFIRM THEIR RELATIONSHIP?
Despite rumors about the pair dating swirling since last year, Beatrice and Edoardo made their debut as a couple at the National Portrait Gallery’s 2019 Gala last month.
Since then they have been spotted together on numerous occasions, with Edoardo joining Beatrice and Fergie at the Bahrain Grand Prix for a family trip earlier this month.

Dr. Matthew Stryker: Who profits from drug price decreases?,www.foxnews.com,Matthew Stryker,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dr-matthew-stryker-who-profits-from-drug-price-decreases,"The Trump administration has been pushing for lower drug prices, and some drug manufacturers have responded by lowering prices and providing greater access to life-saving treatments. However, there is a growing concern among health care providers that the middlemen who negotiate drug prices on behalf of insurers – known as pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) – are actively working to keep prices high for consumers, presumably in an effort to increase their own profits.
I run a free cardiovascular risk reduction service at a local clinic where we see many patients either suffering from, or at high risk for, heart disease. In collaboration with providers, I work to apply evidence-based medicine in the clinical setting and ensure any new treatment is financially sustainable for a patient – a task that can be made difficult by profit-driven insurance companies denying medication access and PBMs that keep treatment costs high.
When it comes to treating and preventing heart disease, access and affordability to the right kind of medication can be the difference between life and death.
I’ve been encouraged by some drug manufacturers&apos; willingness to reduce the list prices of their medications to improve affordability for patients. Last fall, Amgen lowered the list price of Repatha, a drug that treats high cholesterol and helps reduce the risk of cardiovascular-related events, by 60 percent. Regeneron and Sanofi have recently followed suit, announcing plans to reduce the price of Praluent, a PCSK9 inhibitor in the same class as Repatha, by a similar amount.
However, I’ve since discovered that one PBM has refused to make Repatha available to certain patients at the lower price. Instead, they are pressuring providers to prescribe the drug at its previous, higher list price – think sticker price of a car – which could cost patients as much as $300 more for each prescription. These PBM price-hike policies often hit older adults the hardest, largely because rather than a set co-pay, patients using Medicare Part D often have to pay a percentage of the total cost for high-tiered specialty medications like Repatha.
This lack of prescription drug price transparency can be incredibly confusing and harmful for Medicare patients. Many Medicare Part D recipients may see television commercials advertising coupons that would help subsidize a drug’s price; however, unlike patients covered by commercial or private insurance, Medicare Part D patients often do not qualify for these cost-saving opportunities. Consequently, many older adults with Medicare Part D, facing these high out-of-pocket costs, find themselves unable to afford medications and abandon their prescription at the pharmacy counter.
It’s not just individual patients that are being harmed. PBMs have also been making hundreds of millions of dollars by overcharging Medicaid programs for prescription drugs at the expense of taxpayers.
A recent report by the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services found that PBMs made at least $123 million in profit last year by charging that state’s Medicaid program more for medications than it paid pharmacies for the treatments. Through this spread pricing model, 12.9 percent of the taxpayer money spent on prescription drugs went into the pockets of the PBMs.
It seems highly unlikely that practice is isolated to Kentucky, which suggests that PBMs could be making billions of dollars each year nationwide simply by exploiting the lack of transparency in drug pricing to charge whatever they want for treatments. That’s money that should be spent providing quality care to low-income Americans.
President Trump has made drug pricing transparency a focus of his efforts to reduce costs for patients. Congress must also push for greater transparency in PBM pricing, and demand that these companies pass any and all drug savings along to consumers and taxpayers.
When it comes to treating and preventing heart disease, access and affordability to the right kind of medication can be the difference between life and death. Our health care system is like a machine; defective parts yield minimal output. Ours is in need of repair, and working to address the damaged PBM cogwheel puts us one step closer to ensuring quality output to improve patient access and outcomes.

"Worst of both worlds: Trump ousts Kirstjen Nielsen, media hammer her",www.foxnews.com,Howard Kurtz,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/worst-of-both-worlds-trump-ousts-kirstjen-nielsen-media-hammer-her,"The Mexican border , an issue that helped get Donald Trump elected, continues to bedevil his presidency. One quote from my book ""Media Madness,"" uttered privately before the midterms , has always resonated with me.
Steve Bannon told the president: ""Don't think you’re getting away without building a wall. You said it too many times at too many rallies. Nancy Pelosi will get the House. They're going to swear themselves in and [blanking] impeach you.""
He was right about Pelosi, though impeachment clearly isn't happening. But Bannon's larger point was that the wall and border security is so crucial to Donald Trump's base that he can't survive unless he does everything in his power to deliver on his promise.
That's why Trump triggered the 35-day government shutdown, that's why he declared a national emergency to get wall funding, that's why he threatened to close the border last week before backing off.
NEW ACTING DHS BOSS HAS LONG RECORD IN BORDER SECURITY
And that's why he forced Kirstjen Nielsen out of her job.
The Homeland Security secretary walked into a meeting with the president Sunday night expecting to stay on the job and walked out unable to get her resignation letter out before he tweeted the news. That's not a voluntary departure. (Yesterday's firing of Secret Service chief Randolph Alles adds fuel to what The New York Times is calling a ""purge."")
In the end, she got the worst of both worlds. She will forever be defined as the Cabinet member who presided over the forced separation of migrant children from their families, leading to such devastating worldwide reaction that Trump was forced to abandon the policy. And yet the president did not deem her tough enough on illegal immigration.
READ HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY KIRSTJEN NIELSEN'S RESIGNATION LETTER
In fact, based on reports from CNN and NBC, Trump wants to reinstate the family separation approach, and Nielsen's resistance to that may have been the final straw. She had asked for Sunday's sitdown.
""Mr. Trump in recent weeks had asked Ms. Nielsen to close the ports of entry along the border and to stop accepting asylum seekers, which Ms. Nielsen found ineffective and inappropriate,"" the Times says . ""While the 30-minute meeting was cordial, Mr. Trump was determined to ask for her resignation. After the meeting, she submitted it."" 2020 Democrats take victory lap after Nielsen announces resignation
Most pundits expected Nielsen to be dumped after the midterms, especially after the departure of her mentor, chief of staff John Kelly, who previously ran Homeland Security and pushed her for the post. But then her position seemed to stabilize.
In a possible harbinger, Lou Dobbs, the Fox Business host who speaks privately with Trump, called for Nielsen's firing on his show nearly two weeks ago.
More from the Times: ""The president called Ms. Nielsen at home early in the mornings to demand that she take action to stop migrants from entering the country, including doing things that were clearly illegal, such as blocking all migrants from seeking asylum. She repeatedly noted the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws, court settlements and international obligations.
Those responses only infuriated Mr. Trump further.""
Plus: ""Multiple White House officials said she had grown deeply paranoid in recent months, after numerous stories about her job being on the line."" Kirstjen Nielsen: I share President Trump's goal of securing the border
It was a bit sad watching Nielsen briefly talk to reporters staked out at her Alexandria home yesterday, thanking the president, offering no hint of their disagreements and taking no questions.
But the press had little sympathy for Nielsen. A Times editorial said she ""enforced cruelty at the border.""
CNN's Jeff Toobin said Nielsen will be remembered as ""the woman who put children in cages.""
The Daily Beast's Michael Tomasky: ""Kirstjen Nielsen Was Heartless, But Not Heartless Enough for Trump.""
But if she is forever defined by the 2018 breakup of families, Nielsen was not an ardent advocate. She ""hesitated for weeks about whether to sign a memo ordering the routine separation of migrant children from their families so that the parents could be detained,"" the Times says. Yet it was she who got hammered at Hill hearings when she had to defend the policy.
Trump will name Customs and Border Protection chief Kevin McAleenan, said to be more of a hard-liner, as her acting successor.

The stakes for the president are laid out in a Washington Post piece that also includes his on again, off again assault on ObamaCare:
""Trump's dark warnings pose a central conundrum for his reelection effort: Can he win the White House a second time by railing against the very problems he promised to fix?""
That hearkens back to Bannon's warning to Trump about the border and the wall as the key to 2020 — and explains why Kirstjen Nielsen is about to become a private citizen.

In my capacity as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I’ve made it a priority to find these answers and work toward solutions. On Tuesday, my committee is conducting a hearing where members will hear from executives of five pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), middlemen in the drug price discussion.
This hearing is the third in a series to scrutinize prescription drug pricing. This hearing will provide PBMs the opportunity to describe their specific role in how patients get their medications and how much they pay for them. Furthermore, they will have the chance to describe the value they bring and the steps Congress can take to improve the system. The hearing will help advance my efforts to identify bipartisan solutions which can become law, and my hope is that the PBMs will prove to be helpful partners.
Transparency is also needed when it comes to television advertisements for prescription drugs. The average American sees nine television drug ads every day.
Legislation I will support will be guided by the free market principle that increased competition leads to lower prices. Generic medications are a prime example of this principle of lowering prices by increasing competition. I support efforts to get safe generic options to market. I also support legislation like the CREATES Act and the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act, which would help put a stop to abusive practices that block generic competition.
Other ideas I favor include transparency wherever it can be applied. The Physician Payments Sunshine Law I wrote requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to report payments made by them to doctors and teaching hospitals. Last Congress, we added nurse practitioners and physicians assistants to the same reporting mechanism. Because of this law, patients and researchers may look up their provider or hospital at the Open Payments website and examine any such payments. While many of these payments are legitimate compensation for activities such as research, the sunshine created results in accountability.
In the same vein, transparency is needed when it comes to television advertisements for prescription drugs. The average American sees nine television drug ads every day. Studies show that patients are more likely to ask their doctor for a specific brand-name medication if they’ve seen it advertised. That behavior tends to increase drug costs. I support President Trump’s efforts to require drug manufacturers to post the list price on any television advertisement for a prescription drug. By requiring this transparency, drug manufacturers will be forced to re-think their pricing strategies.
In the case of the PBM industry, there is a need for greater transparency. At Tuesday’s hearing, I intend to press the PBMs on what can be done to shed light on their activities. I will also address whether the PBMs are acting in the best interests of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries as well as the American taxpayer. Because if they’re not, we need to fix that. I look forward to the hearing and I look forward to introducing more legislation to address the problem of high prescription drug prices.

Hawley suggests Trump admin strip Yale of federal funding if 'targeting' of religious students continues,www.foxnews.com,Gregg Re,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hawley-suggests-trump-admin-strip-yale-of-federal-funding-if-targeting-of-religious-students-continues,"The fiery two-page missive , exclusively obtained by Fox News, comes days after Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz vowed to investigate whether Yale Law School sought to effectively ""blacklist Christian organizations"" by moving to block student funding for fellowships and summer programs deemed ""discriminatory."" ""Even though Yale is not a state institution, it is still subject to statutory restrictions because it receives federal funds,"" Hawley, who graduated from Yale Law School, wrote to Barr. ""And as a law school, Yale is obligated to foster respect for the law. That includes fostering respect for students, their constitutional rights, and their deeply held religious beliefs.""
Tensions first flared in February, when members of the Yale Federalist Society invited a lawyer from the Christian legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) to speak on campus, a move that enraged Yale’s LGBT group “Outlaws,"" who characterized ADF as a ""hate group.""
The students called for Yale to stop providing stipends to students who worked over the summer in the ADF&apos;s popular Blackstone Legal Fellowship. In turn, Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken thanked students for their ""leadership,"" and announced that ""the Law School&apos;s nondiscrimination policy will extend to the Summer Public Interest Fellowship (SPIF), Career Options Assistance Program (COAP), and our post-graduate public interest fellowships.""
Nondiscrimination ""based on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression,"" Gerken wrote, ""is a key component of the Law School&apos;s nondiscrimination policy.""

That policy change, Hawley wrote to Barr on Tuesday, amounted to an effort to ""block students who work for certain faith-based organizations from accessing resources available to all other students,"" and prohibit ""prohibits students from receiving school resources if they work for an organization that takes religion into account when hiring.""
Unlike federal law, Hawley wrote, ""the policy fails to include an exception for religious organizations even though federal law recognizes that religious organizations often cannot fulfill their unique missions without considering religion while hiring.""
Following a conservative backlash -- including a separate letter from Hawley and Cruz&apos;s announcement of an investigation -- the law school put out a new statement affirming that it does not discriminate based on religious beliefs.
""We recently decided that the Law School will require that any employment position it financially supports be open to all of our students,"" the statement read. ""If an employer refuses to hire students because they are Christian, black, veterans, or gay, we will not fund that position.""
The Yale statement continued: ""We are in the process of putting this policy in place. It will solely concern hiring practices. It will not inquire about political goals, litigation strategies, or policy objectives of the organization. It will also include an accommodation for religious organizations and a ministerial exception, consistent with antidiscrimination principles.""
But Hawley wrote to Barr on Tuesday that more details are necessary to confirm whether Yale&apos;s statement was actually meaningful.
Yale University should potentially lose federal funding if it continues to discriminate on the basis of religion, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley wrote Tuesday to Attorney General William Barr. (iStock)
""Last Thursday, after receiving negative media attention for targeting religious students, Yale changed its tune and now says that it will craft a new policy that includes an exemption for &apos;religious organizations,&apos;"" Hawley told Barr. ""But the circumstances surrounding Yale’s announcement suggest that whatever exception Yale does create may be inadequate. When Yale first announced its policy, it did not do so in a void; it did so in response to student protesters.
""Those protesters demanded that Yale strip funding from students who work for Alliance Defending Freedom, a religious organization,"" Hawley continued. ""When announcing its policy, Yale praised those protesters for their &apos;leadership&apos; in raising the issue. And in response to questions about the policy, Yale both declined to include a religious exemption and specifically identified students who work for Alliance Defending Freedom as students the policy targets.""
Citing the 2017 Supreme Court case Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, Hawley wrote that, if a public school had adopted Yale&apos;s initial policy, it would have been struck down as unconstitutional because it “target[s] the religious for ‘special disabilities’ based on their ‘religious status.’”
As a recipient of federal funds, a similar prohibition applies to Yale.
""Given this background, there is a real risk that whatever definition of &apos;religious organization&apos; Yale promulgates will be unreasonably narrow, giving the false impression that Yale is protecting religious students while it is in reality capitulating to the demands of student protesters who want to target certain religious classmates for special disfavor,"" Hawley wrote to Barr.
He concluded: ""I request that your Department protect the rights of these students by monitoring closely the changes Yale is making to its policy and by taking all appropriate legal action to strip Yale of federal funding should it—as an institution that is supposed to be neutral about religion—target religious students for special disfavor. Thank you for your attention to this matter.""
Fox News is told a similar letter is being sent to the Department of Education.

Tucker Carlson: It is not racist to say what's true about immigration -- even Obama and Sanders admit that,www.foxnews.com,Tucker Carlson,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-it-is-not-racist-to-say-whats-true-about-immigration-even-obama-and-sanders-admit-that,"Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen submitted her resignation over the weekend. Nielsen always seemed like a nice person. We just had her on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" last week and she was nice, but it's possible she was never really a good fit for the job that she had. Her views on immigration always seemed better suited for, say, a Jeb Bush administration. During Nielsen's tenure, total deportations were lower than under Barack Obama. The border went from troubled to chaotic to completely out of control. There are now more than 100,000 illegal arrivals showing up from Mexico every month.
Now, Kirstjen Nielsen did not single-handedly cause any of these problems. Unlike so many in Washington, she didn't seem to believe in open borders. She seemed to believe in the law.
CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON.
But that was too much for the left. Nielsen was denounced as an extremist and chased out of restaurants. On Monday, as she left the White House, the morons on TV were making her sound like Dr. Mengele. They said things Nielsen would be remembered as ""the woman who put children in cages"" and broke up families at the border.
So for the year and a half she spent running the Department of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen should never sleep soundly again. Hours after her resignation, a Bloomberg reporter called Jennifer Epstein tweeted this: ""Nielsen's next stop will be carefully watched. If any major companies hire her, pay her to speak, et cetera, expect to see a major outcry from immigration and civil rights groups and beyond.""
In other words, for her sins, Kirstjen Nielsen should not be allowed to have a job. She must be carefully watched. And by the way, anyone who disagrees with that assessment shouldn't be allowed to work either, or speak in public or post on social media or sell books on Amazon or use banks. That's their position. It is the definition of extremism.

""Anyone who disagrees with me must be hurt."" This is not sustainable. Deep down, pretty much everybody knows that. We can't keep living like this, with a small group of unhappy, angry people in power terrifying the rest of us. It is too stupid and cruel and dishonest. Only under the rein of the modern left has it become forbidden to say what is true about immigration and a hundred other topics. But the truth itself has not changed. It won't. Hysteria doesn't make facts disappear.
Countries have borders. That's why they are countries. Saying that isn't hate speech; it's true.
Barack Obama must not be on Twitter because whatever his many faults, that is still obvious to him. During a speech in Berlin , he said the following: ""I worry sometimes when, as we think about how to deal with the immigration issue, we think that any moves towards assimilation of the existing newcomers to the existing culture is somehow a betrayal. Should we want to encourage newcomers to learn the language of the country they are moving to? Of course. Does that mean they can never use their own language? No. Of course, it doesn't mean that. But it's not racist to say, 'Ah, if you're going to be here, then you should learn the language of the country you just arrived at.'""

Assimilation is essential to national cohesion. Immigrants should learn the language. It doesn't sound crazy. By the way, nobody has doubted that in the 240-year history of this country, least of all, the millions of immigrants who have arrived here and immediately learned to sing the national anthem in English. It was self-evident to them and to everyone else.
Only under the reign of the modern left has it become forbidden to say what is true about immigration and a hundred other topics. But the truth itself has not changed. It won't. Hysteria doesn't make facts disappear.
Immigration can be a great thing for a country, but it must be carefully and thoroughly managed. You can't just change a population of a whole country in the space of 50 years and assume things will get better. If you cared about a country, you wouldn't try to do that.
Even Bernie Sanders understands it. At his core, Sanders is an old-fashioned leftist. He wants bigger and more generous welfare benefits. That may or may not be a good idea, but it definitely will not work with open borders. It is impossible with open borders. Sanders acknowledged that the other day, saying, ""If your point is you open the borders, my God, you know, there is a lot of poverty in this world, you are going to have people from all over the world. And I don't think that's something that we can do at this point. Can't do it.""
""There is a lot of poverty in this world,"" Bernie Sanders acknowledges. The poor will move here, and we're going to have to pay for it. My gosh, Sanders must be racist to say something like that. Or maybe he just cares about what happens to America.
All of our leaders should care what happens to America. We don't elect them to improve Mexico, or China or Europe -- no offense against those countries. We put them in office so they will look out for this country and us. Video
How would you feel about your parents if they treated you like Kamala Harris wants to treat the United States? Keep the doors unlocked. Anyone can stay. Sleep in your bed. Eat your breakfast. Nobody is keeping track of how many come and go, or who they are. Your parents aren't around to supervise. They're over at the neighbor's house bragging about what good people they are.
That's what neglects looks like. It's abuse. And that's exactly what's happening right now. People know it. Look at the polls. Americans would like to see less immigration into this country, not because they are bad people, but because they're people. They want the immigrants we do take to be skilled enough to support themselves and to contribute to America right away, not three generations from now.
More than anything, Americans want secure borders. But they're not getting any of that -- and so resentment is building. And why wouldn't it?

Pelosi was asked during a USA Today interview published on Monday about her struggles of running a House caucus while freshmen Democrats such as Ocasio-Cortez are pushing the party further to the left and fighting over more symbolic gestures rather than actually implementing Democratic policies.
“While there are people who have a large number of Twitter followers, what&apos;s important is that we have large numbers of votes on the floor of the House,” Pelosi said.

“As I say to my own district, ‘You go out and elect 218 people, just like San Francisco, then we can talk,&apos;” she said.
This isn’t the first time Pelosi threw shade on Ocasio-Cortez. Earlier this year, the House Speaker somewhat dismissed the Green New Deal during an interview with Politico.
Video “It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive,” Pelosi said. “The green dream, or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they&apos;re for it, right?”
Ocasio-Cortez was reportedly left out of the Pelosi-approved Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, though some reports suggest the New York Democrat voluntarily decided not to join the committee where the legislation to combat climate change will actually be worked out.
The Green New Deal is estimated to cost up to $93 trillion or $600,000 per household, according to studies. The radical measure proposes the transformation of the U.S. economy to cut emissions in addition to retrofitting and replacing every building in an effort to reach the goal.

The 36-year-old’s body was discovered in a shallow grave in the backyard of Rogers’ home in Lennox.
Rogers and Naegle were in a romantic relationship at the time of the murder, officials said.
Naegle’s husband and her sister reported the nurse missing in December 2016 after the 36-year-old went to a birthday party but failed to come home that night. She was supposed to teach a nursing class at West Los Angeles College — where Rogers was a student — the next day, but also never showed up, KTLA reported.
Authorities then arrested Rogers, who later confessed to burying Naegle’s body in his backyard.
Rogers had beaten Naegle with a hammer at least eight times while they were sitting in his car on Dec. 18, 2016, the district attorney’s office said. He then took her back to his house, where he proceeded to hit Naegle two more times with a hammer to “ensure she was dead” before covering her body with dirt and manure.
Rogers threw Naegle’s belongings away and washed the blood off the hammer and car to cover up the murder, prosecutors said .
Naegle was a losing contestant on “Bridalplasty,” where women compete to win their dream wedding and plastic surgery.

The ISS is chock-full of bacteria and fungi: study,www.foxnews.com,New York Post,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/science/the-iss-is-chock-full-of-bacteria-and-fungi-study,"A new study reported by Gizmodo found that a “diverse population of bacteria and fungi” populate the ISS based on 14 months of research. The results, published in the Microbiome Journal , conclude that “intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems” have been effectively cataloged for the first time, which could be used to create safer and cleaner conditions for future space missions, including those to Mars.
Additionally, the findings might be vital in the understanding of “confined built environments” on our own planet, such as medical and pharmaceutical clean rooms, according to the study.
For the experiment, eight different locations aboard the ISS were tested over three flight sample sessions in an effort to determine which microorganisms can populate in a closed space.
To find this, surface wipes from each room were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA), a chemical compound that helps determine the DNA of the bacteria present in the microbiome. Other wipes were left untreated.
Many of the organisms detected were seen as harmful to astronauts because they contain properties that resist antibiotics.
Some of these bacteria include Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas and Bacillus — and fungi such as Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Rhodotorula.
Unsurprisingly, astronauts were to blame for some of the bacteria and fungal cultures on the ISS.
An abundance of human-associated organisms discovered include Staphylococcaceae — which originate in the skin and in the nasal passage — and Enterobacteriaceae, which comes from the gastrointestinal tract.
Prior to this study, many of the bacterial cultures on the ISS were largely unknown — most could not be determined by traditional methods such as petri dish growth.

He apologized soon after and stepped down as host . In a recent interview on Joe Rogan’s podcast , Hart explained that the hardest part of the whole situation was not being able to explain to the many people that asked him why he dabbled in such controversial material.
“They kept trying to look for this hard definition of ‘why.’ And it’s like, I don’t have it. I don’t have the reason why. I thought it would be funny and it wasn’t. That’s the downfall. That’s it,” he told Rogan.
Hart went on to say that he’s a comedian that made the conscious choice to be “sensitive to the times,” arguing that there are many comedians that would have doubled down on their bad jokes rather than step aside.

Hart says his conclusion from the Oscars debacle is that audiences are moving to a culture of trying to destroy the careers of comedians that they have the influence to drag through the court of public opinion.
“I think it’s easier to just say ‘I’m not a fan. That comedy isn’t for me,’” Hart said. “‘You know what, I don’t like the taste of this particular comedian, so I’m not going to support or watch that comedian. I’m going to find another comedian that’s more to my liking. I’m going to go and just turn my head.’ I want us to get back to understanding that you just don’t have to support it. That’s it.”
Hart concluded: “I don’t understand why there’s a push to destroy when you just don’t have to support or like.”
Video The 39-year-old comedian’s posts resurfaced shortly after he announced himself as the 2019 Oscars host.
""Stop searching for reasons to be angry.... I swear I wish you guys could see/feel/understand the mental place that I am in,"" Hart captioned a response video at the time . “I am truly happy people ... there is nothing that you can do to change that ... NOTHING. I work hard on a daily basis to spread positivity to all ... with that being said. If u want to search my history or past and anger yourselves with what u find that is fine with me.”
Despite an initial attempt to downplay the controversy, the comedian announced just two days later that he was stepping down as the host .
“I have made the choice to step down from hosting this year&apos;s Oscar&apos;s....this is because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists. I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past,” he tweeted at the time .

New York State Republican Party Chairman Ed Cox sounds off. The chairman of New York’s Republican Party hit back at the “outrageous” push by Democratic lawmakers in his home state to seek the release of President Trump’s tax returns. New York Democrats launched a new effort Monday to secure Trump’s state tax returns. Under New York tax law, it is illegal to share someone’s state tax return information.
State Sen. Brad Hoylman introduced S5072 , which would amend the law in an attempt to let the state share tax return information with congressional committees that request it.
But speaking to Fox & Friends Tuesday, Ed Cox, chairman of the New York State Republican Party, ripped the “partisan” move.
NEW YORK DEMOCRATS LAUNCH FRESH BID TO DIG UP TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS
“It is outrageous,” he told host Ainsley Earhardt. “Because everyone has a right to keep their tax returns private under federal law and under state law, and here they are changing the law, legislation got passed, [Gov. Andrew] Cuomo says he’s going to sign it just for the President of the United States to force him to expose his tax returns, while they’re under audit.
“Look, there are a lot of agents looking at his tax returns - ‘you can take this deduction, you can’t take that deduction’– but the American people during the campaign, he made it clear ‘I’m not going to release my tax returns’– and guess what? They elected him President of the United States.”
He accused the Democrats of mounting nothing but a fishing expedition to try and find something on Trump, reiterating that it was nothing more than a “bill of attainder,” an unconstitutional legislative act that singles out an individual for punishment without trial.
MULVANEY VOWS DEMS WILL 'NEVER' SEE TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS, DESPITE RENEWED PUSH
“This is a bill of attainder aimed at one person,” Cox said. “A bill of attainder is an ancient thing where the king doesn’t want a person to go to trial, he just wants to execute them. You have no privileges under law. You are executed. That is abhorrent under America. The Constitution forbids states from doing that, and this is a bill of attainder.”

Hoylman said in a statement Monday: “This new bill will permit New York State to comply with requests from congressional investigative committees and help ensure Congress can’t be blocked in their attempts to hold even the highest elected officials in the land accountable to the American people.”

Ezekiel Hicks, 25, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of Craig Brewer (Photo: Alachua County Sheriff’s Office) A good Samaritan handing out $20 bills to customers was fatally shot inside a Waffle House in Florida this past weekend after an altercation with a disgruntled woman, authorities said. Ezekiel Hicks, 25, was charged with murder Sunday in the death of 41-year-old Craig Brewer, who was shot and killed at a restaurant in Gainesville, just a few miles from the University of Florida .
Brewer, who was passing out cash and offering to pay for meals, got into a dispute with Hicks after arguing with the suspect’s female acquaintance, who was reportedly upset Brewer didn’t pay for her food.
Hicks exited the restaurant after the encounter but soon returned armed with a 9mm Glock pistol, FOX35 Orlando reported. Authorities said after a brief physical altercation, Hicks fired multiple rounds into the victim. Brewer was pronounced dead at the scene.
Officials with the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office say the encounter was captured on surveillance footage.
Hicks was arrested near the restaurant soon after the incident and reportedly admitted to the shooting, authorities said. He faces first-degree murder and unlicensed firearm charges. Gerren Keith Gaynor is a Digital Editor at Fox News. Follow him on Twitter @MrGerrenalis t. Trending in US"

Arab countries unanimously rejected the recent U.S. recognition of Israeli control over the Golan, seized from Syria in 1967 and annexed in 1981, calling the Trump administration's policies unfairly biased toward Israel.
But for Lebanon, there are fears over its claim to the Chebaa Farms and adjacent Kfar Chouba hills, which Israel occupied alongside Golan in 1967.

Trump highlights decades-long feud with Nadler: 'Some things never end',www.foxnews.com,Brooke Singman,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-highlights-decades-long-feud-with-nadler,"Trump making moves at DHS as immigration crisis heats up Trump making personnel changes amid border frustrations; reaction and analysis from former acting ICE director Tom Homan. President Trump said Tuesday that ""some things never end"" as he highlighted his decades-long feud with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler , following a report revealing details of a 1980s real estate deal that started their bad blood. “Congressman Jerry Nadler fought me for years on a very large development I built on the West Side of Manhattan. He wanted a Rail Yard built underneath the development or even better, to stop the job. He didn’t get either & the development became VERY successful,” Trump tweeted Tuesday.
DEMS RAMP UP ANTI-TRUMP PROBES POST-MUELLER, DESPITE PLEDGE TO FOCUS ON AGENDA
“Nevertheless, I got along very well with Jerry during the zoning and building process. Then I changed course (slightly), became President, and now I am dealing with Congressman Nadler again. Some things never end, but hopefully it will all go well for everyone. Only time will tell!” he added.
The president’s tweets come after The Washington Post reported on the history of their feud. The Post reported that it began in 1985, when Nadler was a New York State assemblyman. The Post reported that Trump, at the time, purchased property in Nadler’s district and wanted to build a development, which he reportedly wanted to call “Television City.” But Nadler wanted the property, which was a former railroad yard, to be upgraded instead. Nadler reportedly blocked Trump from public funds and mortgage insurance. Video
Trump ultimately began construction on the property and worked to develop residential buildings, but in 2005, after construction delays and pushback from lawmakers, Trump reportedly sold the property for $1.8 billion.
After Trump was elected president in 2016, residents of the apartments on that property voted to remove the name, Trump Place, from the buildings.
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN NADLER ACCUSED OF HYPOCRISY ON MUELLER REPORT
Fast-forward to 2019, and Nadler’s committee is leading several Trump-related inquiries. Last month, Nadler sent document requests to 81 individuals and entities connected to the president and his business dealings.
Nadler, D-N.Y., imposed a deadline last month for responses to be submitted, but at the time, only a fraction had responded.
Nadler’s panel is also leading the charge in demanding that Attorney General Bill Barr release Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report in an unredacted format to the committee.
At this point, Barr has said that he will share the report with Congress by mid-April, but that the more than 400-page report is under review at the Justice Department with the help of Mueller and his team. Barr said that they are “well along in the process of identifying and redacting” sensitive material in the report before turning it over to Congress.
According to Barr’s summary of the report, the special counsel found no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.
The special counsel also reviewed whether the president had obstructed justice in any way, but ultimately did not come to a conclusion on that issue. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, though, said the evidence was “not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.” Brooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

""We could see over a foot of snow and windy conditions and the potential for flooding ahead of this, some ice as well.""
The storm moving in from the Pacific Ocean is forecast to intensify and form into a new inland "" bomb cyclone ."" A bomb cyclone is a rapid drop in air pressure — at least 24 millibars in 24 hours — and often is over or near oceans or seas because it requires warm moist air smacking into cold dry air, along with volatile weather from the jet stream.

Heavy snow and strong winds from the storm are forecast to produce ""life-threatening"" travel conditions across the region starting Wednesday, according to the WPC. Blizzard conditions are expected as winds intensify late Tuesday into Wednesday.
""The heavy wet snow may also lead to power outages,"" the NWS said .
What is a ‘bomb cyclone’ What is a ‘bomb cyclone?’ An explanation of the powerful storm.
This would be the second such storm in less than a month. The March 13 storm caused massive flooding in the Midwest, a blizzard in Colorado and Wyoming, and produced winds of between 96 mph and 110 mph.
Besides heavy snow, rain will stretch across parts of the central U.S. that are still dealing with river flooding, including Iowa and Illinois. There is also the threat of severe weather for the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys through Thursday.
This week&apos;s bomb cyclone one is expected to be similar in intensity and in snowfall, meteorologists said. Heavy, wet snow will fall from the Nebraska panhandle through south central and southeastern South Dakota into western Minnesota. Wind speeds can reach 50 mph to 60 mph across Kansas.
Up to 2 feet of snow is forecast from the late-season winter storm across the Central U.S., in addition to heavy rain. (Fox News)
The intense storm system may affect up to 200 million Americans by the end of the week, according to AccuWeather .
Blizzard warnings stretch from Nebraska to western Minnesota , where up to 2 feet of ""very heavy and wet"" snow may fall.
""A potentially historic winter storm will bring severe impacts Wednesday night into early Friday, similar to the one last April,"" the NWS Twin Cities office said on Twitter .
""This may not be your typical blizzard with dry, powdery snow for the Plains and Upper Midwest,"" said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski. ""But, this may be more of a plastering effect with heavy, wet snow that is difficult to shovel and plow.""
Heavy snow may also impact the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, which is also forecast to see rain before the changeover to frozen precipitation.
""If the mix doesn`t reach as far north as the Twin Cities, then perhaps the metro could experience blizzard conditions as well -- similar to what happened last year,"" the NWS office said .
After impacting the Central U.S., the storm system is forecast to eventually bring rain to the Northeast by the end of the week.

On April 5, Natasha Hodgson took to Twitter to share a picture of the cards, in a post which has been liked over 20,000 times and sparked more than 250 comments.
METS FAN HITS IT OUT OF THE PARK WITH 'SINGLE' PITCH
“Ahh yes the two sides of heterosexuality, commerce and toil,” the woman quipped of the products, which appear to be positioned on a store shelf.
Though it remains unclear what store Hodgson spotted the notes at, they have since been revealed to be sold by Lola & Gilbert Ltd. through NotOnTheHighStreet, a London-based gift shop where they are retail for $2.55 apiece, The Sun reports.
Some Twitters users, meanwhile, proclaimed that the “sexist” products seemed more attuned to the values of a time gone by.
“Wow. Is it still 1955?” one cynic quipped.
""Gosh! When are we going to evolve?"" another asked.

“Just no!! My husband cooks, and I’ll buy my own darn flowers if I want to. Also-that font is a crime against typography!” one user opined.
Other commenters, meanwhile, offered examples of everyday retail products that supposedly thrust gender stereotypes onto children at a young age, from pink and blue bottles to books.
Some Twitter commenters, nevertheless, didn’t find the cards to be quite so troubling.
“When are people going to stop moaning over every little thing in life? Boo hoo, someone done something you don’t like,” a detractor defended. “Guess what, you can just choose to ignore it and move on instead of crying over everything that doesn’t fit in with your way of thinking.”
Jokesters, too, couldn’t resist poking fun at the outcry in larger sense.
“Can someone give me sandwiches and some flowers or am I only allowed one choice?” one wondered.
“Where is the ‘you’re the kind of person I’d pick up tacos for’ [card]?” another exclaimed.
“Who thought these cards would be a good idea lol” another skeptic moaned. Janine Puhak is an editor for Fox News Lifestyle. Follow her on Twitter at @JaninePuhak Trending in Lifestyle "

IMF forecast: Global growth will weaken this year to 3.3%,www.foxnews.com,PAUL WISEMAN and MARTIN CRUTSINGER,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/imf-forecast-global-growth-will-weaken-this-year-to-3-3,"Email WASHINGTON – The International Monetary Fund is downgrading its outlook for growth in the United States, Europe, Japan and the overall global economy and points to heightened trade tensions as a key reason. The IMF expects the world economy to grow 3.3% this year, down from 3.6% in 2018. That would match 2016 for the weakest year since 2009. In its previous forecast in January, the IMF had predicted that international growth would reach 3.5% this year.
For the United States, IMF economists downgraded their growth forecast for this year to 2.3% from 2.9% in 2018.
The IMF's World Economic Outlook comes on the eve of meetings in Washington this week of the fund and its sister lending organization, the World Bank.
In Europe, the IMF expects the 19 countries that use the euro currency to expand 1.3% collectively in 2019, weaker than last year's 1.8% growth or in any year since 2013.
Japan is expected to eke out 1% growth this year, up from 0.8% in 2018 but slightly down from the fund's earlier forecast.
The IMF foresees the Chinese economy growing 6.3% this year, down from 6.6% in 2018. But the fund's latest 2019 outlook was a slight upgrade from the 6.2% growth it had forecast for China in January.
China's prospects brightened, the fund said, after President Donald Trump decided to suspend a planned increase in tariffs on $200 billion worth of U.S.-bound Chinese exports.
Still, the fund is expressing worries about tensions between the world's two biggest economies, which have traded tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of products in a fight over China's aggressive push to supplant American technological supremacy. The prospect of Britain's messy departure from the European Union also weighs on the global economy.
The IMF expects growth in world trade to drop to 3.4% this year — a sharp slowdown from the 4% it had expected in January and from 3.8% trade growth in 2018. Trending in US"
Barr faces grilling on Mueller report handling at House hearing,www.foxnews.com,Brooke Singman,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-grilled-on-mueller-report-findings-at-house-hearing-in-first-appearance,"Barr: Full Mueller report with redactions will be released within a week Appearing before a House subcommittee hearing, Attorney General William Barr explains to lawmakers how redactions will be identified and says his timetable for a mid-April release still stands. Attorney General Bill Barr vowed Tuesday to release a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report ""within a week,"" as he pushed back at Democrats blasting him for what they called his ""unacceptable"" handling of the initial summary of that document. Barr testified before a congressional panel on Capitol Hill in his first appearance since revealing the central findings of Mueller's Russia investigation. Despite the Democratic criticism, he said his office is hard at work preparing to release the report.
GIULIANI SLAMS RUSSIA PROBE LEAKS
“Right now the special counsel is working with us. This process is going along very well and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid-April stands,"" Barr testified. ""From my standpoint, within a week, I will be in a position to release the report to the public and then I will engage with both chairmen of Judiciary Committees on any requests that they have.""
Barr said that he identified four areas of the report that he believed should be redacted, including grand jury material, information the intelligence community believes would reveal intelligence sources and methods, any material that could interfere with ongoing prosecutions, and information that could implicate the privacy or reputational interests of “peripheral players.”
Barr said that the Justice Department, with the help of the special counsel's office, plans to “color code the decisions from the report and provide explanatory notes describing the basis for each redaction.”
Barr maintained that he is working ""diligently to make as much information as possible available to Congress.""
But in a fiery opening statement, House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., accused Barr of seeming to ""cherry pick"" from the report to ""draw the most favorable conclusion possible for the president"" in releasing the four-page summary last month on its findings.
Other Democrats made similar comments as Barr appeared before the House Appropriations Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee for a hearing originally meant to address Barr’s fiscal 2020 spending request for the Justice Department. But in the wake of the battle between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration for the release of the full Russia report, Barr faced swift criticism from lawmakers on his decisions related to the review of Mueller’s findings.
DEMS RAMP UP ANTI-TRUMP PROBES POST-MUELLER
Subcommittee Chairman José Serrano, D-N.Y., said the Mueller issue was impossible to ignore.
“In extremely quick fashion, you turned a 300-plus page report into a four-page letter that supposedly summarized [Mueller’s] findings,” the subcommittee chairman said Tuesday.
""The American people have been left with many unanswered questions,"" Serrano said, adding that ""this Congress voted unanimously to see that report. ... I believe the American people deserve to see the full report and to be trusted to reach our own determinations on the merit of what the special counsel presented.""
He added: ""It is a blow to our system and to our democracy if that report is not seen.""
Serrano said that the committee did not want to be ""in a confrontational position"" with Barr, but rather wanted to ""help"" him ""do his job.""
Lawmakers focused on Barr’s four-page summary of the special counsel report, where he stated that there was no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. The special counsel also reviewed whether the president had obstructed justice in any way, but ultimately did not come to a conclusion on that issue. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, though, said the evidence was “not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.”
Lowey also slammed Barr's handling of the report as ""unacceptable.""
""I must say, it is extraordinary to evaluate hundreds of pages of evidence, legal documents, and findings based on a 22-month long inquiry and make definitive legal conclusions in less than 48 hours,"" Lowey said. ""Even for someone who has done this job before, I would argue it is more suspicious than impressive.""
After repeated exchanges about the report, Barr eventually appeared to bristle at questions from Democrats about the reports' process and contents.
Under subsequent questioning from Lowey, Barr said he would not discuss the report any further and made clear that he has no plans at the moment to initially release the unredacted version to committees.
Meanwhile, in a statement last week responding to media reports, the DOJ defended Barr's rollout of Mueller's conclusions.
""Given the extraordinary public interest in the matter, the Attorney General decided to release the report's bottom-line findings and his conclusions immediately — without attempting to summarize the report — with the understanding that the report itself would be released after the redaction process,"" the Justice Department statement said.
The statement also said that every page of Mueller's report was marked that it may contain grand jury material ""and therefore could not immediately be released.""

Benito Mussolini’s great-grandson enters Italian politics with far-right party,www.foxnews.com,Lucia Suarez Sang,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/benito-mussolinis-great-grandson-enters-politics-with-far-right-party,"Caio Giulio Cesare Mussolini – whose name also references one of ancient Rome’s most famous leaders – is running as a candidate for the far-right Brothers of Italy in the upcoming European Union elections. The former submariner in the Italian navy would be the third descendant of the Italian dictator to hold public office.
“I share their ideas about retaking sovereignty, protecting our country and the family,” Mussolini told The Times of London on his party. “Why spend [$113] on a migrant then peanuts on pensioners?”
Benito Mussolini was Italy’s dictator for two decades until his summary execution in 1945. He remains popular with many Italians today who say he modernized the country before damaging his reputation some with racist laws and an alliance with Hitler.

""There were a lot of good things and some mistakes,” Caio Mussolini said.
The 50-year-old told the Times that he hopes to be judged by his experience, not his name. In addition to his time in the Italian navy, he was the Middle East representative for the country’s largest defense company before entering politics.
“My experience gives me a background in international relations,” he said.
The political debut of the latest Mussolini led to protests over the weekend and even included Facebook taking down his profile. The candidate said Tuesday his profile had been restored, with apologies.
He is not the only descendant of Il Duce to have joined the political arena. Rachele Mussolini, 44, a granddaughter, is a Rome city council member. Her stepsister, Alessandra Mussolini, 52, is an EU parliamentarian for Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party.
A keen defender of her grandfather, Alessandra Mussolini was recently involved in a Twitter feud with actor Jim Carrey , who tweeted a drawing of the dictator’s lynched corpse.

Manziel is hoping the name change will aid him as he attempts to move forward in his career. He's hoping to get another shot in the NFL after his initial short run with the Cleveland Browns, which led to his stints in the Canadian Football League and Alliance of American Football. Things haven't worked out quite like Johnny Manziel hoped they would. Maybe John Manziel will have better luck. The former college football star-turned-professional bust appears to be turning over a new leaf after failed runs in the NFL and Canadian Football League and a shortened season with the Memphis Express of the Alliance of American Football.
Manziel, speaking to the “Dan Patrick Show” on Sunday, said he wants to go by John now instead of Johnny.
“I have a little update for you. I actually go by John these days. So, I’m kind of just turning over the page and moving forward a little bit,” he said.
But ""John Football"" doesn't really have the same ring to it.
Manziel added he’s hoping to get another shot in the NFL after a short run with the Cleveland Browns, which led to his journey to the other football leagues.
“All I want is an opportunity to come in and prove that, I believe, I’m a different person these days,” he told the show. “I believe that I’m willing to put in the work to get to where I want to be, and I’m not scared of that anymore.”
If Manziel should get another shot at the NFL, he would be on a short list of AAF quarterbacks who signed with an NFL team.

Butcher's leg reportedly swells to over 300 pounds after contracting parasitic infection,www.foxnews.com,Alexandria Hein,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/butchers-leg-reportedly-swells-to-over-300-pounds-after-contracting-parasitic-infection,"A butcher in Pakistan is pleading for doctors to amputate his 330-pound leg despite allegedly being told that the surgery could kill him. Muhammad Mushtaq, who said he first noticed a lump on his leg two years ago, is currently bedbound and was diagnosed with elephantiasis. Elephantiasis is characterized by gross enlargement of an area of the body, typically involving the limbs, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD). It can also affect the genitals, and is caused by the obstruction of the lymphatic system, which results in the accumulation of fluids. The main symptom is swelling with the skin of infected areas becoming ulcerated, pitted, dry and thickened.
Mushtag, 40, told Caters News Agency that he developed the condition as a result of a parasitic infection, and that it’s been “extremely painful” for him.
Mushtaq said surgeons told him amputation of the affected leg could kill him. (Caters News Agency)
“I am locked in my room the entire day and I need the help of six people to lift me because of my weight,” he told the news agency, according to Mirror.co.uk. “If there is no treatment that can save my leg that’s fine, I want my 21-stone leg amputated if that’s the case though.”
Mushtag said he’s taking his case to the government after a clinic in Lahore, Punjab, said the surgery would be too dangerous.
“They gave me medicines to treat fungal infection but said there was no way to treat the condition as the infection had reached the veins and I could lose blood in surgery,” he told Caters News Agency.
A neighbor who is a doctor is reportedly trying to help Mushtag see a specialist for a second opinion.
“We have heard of Professor Naushad from Civil Hospital in Karachi who treated a similar patient Essa Pallari,” Dr. Ruman-ul-Haq told Caters News Agency. “This has given Mohammed hope that we will find his treatment somewhere.”
Pallari had reportedly suffered from plexiform neurofibromatosis, which affects the growth and development of cell tissue. He reportedly couldn’t walk before surgery due to the massive growths on his legs, but has since recovered.

Doctor forcibly dragged from United Airlines flight finally speaks out: 'The accident turned out the positive way',www.foxnews.com,Michael Bartiromo,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/doctor-forcibly-dragged-from-united-airlines-flight-finally-speaks-out-the-accident-turned-out-the-positive-way,"Dr. Dao, from Kentucky, appeared in an interview that aired on “Good Morning America” to discuss the aftermath of the flight, as well as his reaction to the now-viral footage of the incident. “I don’t know, I just cried,” he told ABC News ’ Amy Roback of seeing the video clips taken by fellow passengers.
Dao added that he remembered nothing between the time he initially went unconscious and later woke up in a hospital where he received treatment for his injuries, despite returning to the plane following his involuntary removal and repeating, “I want to go home,” with his face still bloodied.
He suffered a broken nose, lacerations to his face, missing teeth and a concussion , according to reports.
Following the incident, Dao said he became overwhelmed by the media attention and scrutiny, and didn’t leave his house for “months.” Dao, who told “Good Morning America” he was actually planning to open a veterans’ medical facility following the fateful April 2017 flight, added that he found his solace in charity work.
In late April, Dao had settled with United for an undisclosed amount .
Video ""We are pleased to report that United and Dr. Dao have reached an amicable resolution of the unfortunate incident that occurred aboard flight 3411. We look forward to implementing the improvements we have announced, which will put our customers at the center of everything we do,” a United spokesperson said at the time.
Despite this, Dao said he wasn’t upset with the Chicago Department of Aviation officers who removed him from the plane, saying they only had “a job to do.” And furthermore, Dao claimed he was actually happy with how the events turned out, as it forced airlines to “change polic[ies]” for the better.
“Well, the most important thing is, the accident turned out the positive way,” Dao said.
In the wake of the incident, United CEO Oscar Munoz announced several policy changes, including a $10,000 incentive for voluntarily bumped passengers on overbooked flights, new time restrictions for when crew members must arrive in order to bump passengers, and a promise to reduce the amount of overbooking on flights.
Video In a statement shared with Fox News on Tuesday, United Airlines said the incident was a “defining moment” that the company uses as a learning experience.
“Flight 3411 was a defining moment for United Airlines and it is our responsibility to make sure we as a company and all of our 90,000 employees continue to learn from that experience.
“The changes we have implemented since that incident better serve our customers and further empower our employees. This year, we are focused more than ever on our commitment to our customers, looking at every aspect of our business to ensure that we keep their best interests at the center of everything that we do.
“As our CEO Oscar Munoz has said, we at United never want anyone in the United family to forget the experience of Flight 3411. It makes us a better airline, a more caring company and a stronger team.”

Third Mussolini descendent enters Italian political arena,www.foxnews.com,COLLEEN BARRY,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/third-mussolini-descendent-enters-italian-political-arena,"Europe Published 1 hour ago Third Mussolini descendent enters Italian political arena By COLLEEN BARRY | Associated Press Facebook Twitter Flipboard Print Email MILAN – A third descendant of Italy&apos;s long-time fascist dictator Benito Mussolini is entering the political arena.
Caio Giulio Cesare Mussolini — Mussolini&apos;s great-grandson, whose name is taken from one of ancient Rome&apos;s most famous rulers — is running as a candidate in European elections for the far-right Brothers of Italy Party.
Party leader Giorgia Meloni announced Mussolini&apos;s candidacy over the weekend. His political ambitions follow that of his second cousins, Alessandra Mussolini, an EU parliamentarian for Silvio Berlusconi&apos;s Forza Italia party, and Rachele Mussolini, a Rome city council member associated with Brothers of Italy.
Meloni said protests against the latest Mussolini political debut led Facebook to cancel his profile due to his last name. Caio Mussolini said Tuesday that his profile had been restored, with apologies.
Caio Mussolini, 51, was a naval officer for 15 years, then an executive in Italy&apos;s largest defense contractor Finmeccanica before turning to politics.
""He is a professional, a serviceman, a patriot,"" Meloni said against the backdrop of the multi-arched facade of the Palace of Italian Civilization that was built by Benito Mussolini and known to modern-day Romans as the ""Squared Colosseum.""
Standing beside Meloni, Caio Mussolini, who is running in southern Italy, called it an honor to run for Brothers of Italy, which he described as ""patriotic, like I am.""
In an interview with the right-wing paper Libero, Caio Mussolini conceded that his name is not an easy one to carry, but that he will ""never be ashamed of my family.""
Asked if he would define himself as a fascist, he responded: ""Fascism died with Benito Mussolini.""
He added that he was born well after that period and that fascism was now something for ""historians to study."" Anyone worried about its revival, he said, ""is seeing imaginary enemies.""
""I see other dangers. The thought police, globalism, the dictatorship of political correctness, uncontrolled immigration a few small financial groups that control everything, Islamic extremism,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying.
Benito Mussolini was Italy&apos;s dictator for two decades until his summary execution in 1945.
Mussolini plunged Italy into World War II, allying himself with Nazi Germany&apos;s leader Adolf Hitler, and signing racial laws that led to the deportation and murders of thousands of Italian Jews.
That modern-day politicians stir controversies when they praise any Mussolini accomplishment, particularly infrastructure, underlines the dictator&apos;s fraught legacy.
Neo-fascist parties remained part of Italy&apos;s post-war political landscape, even though supporting fascism became a crime.
Mussolini&apos;s grand-daughter Alessandra has been part of Italian politics for decades, first as a member of a party founded after the war by her grandfather&apos;s supporters, then by successor movements that moderated their rhetoric before being absorbed into conservative parties.
At the same time, anti-fascism became prominent in post-war Italian history, wielded against even to those who were not fascists at all. That created a political culture of rebellion against demonizing fascism, despite the damage it did."

Woolly mammoth mystery solved? Study reveals shocking details about prehistoric creature,www.foxnews.com,Chris Ciaccia,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/science/woolly-mammoth-mystery-solved-study-reveals-shocking-details-about-prehistoric-creature,"The study, published by researchers at Tel Aviv University, suggests that because of their shared geography, mammoths and Neanderthals likely had similar molecular characteristics that allowed them to adapt to their harsh environmental surroundings. ""Neanderthals and mammoths lived together in Europe during the Ice Age. The evidence suggests that Neanderthals hunted and ate mammoths for tens of thousands of years and were actually physically dependent on calories extracted from mammoths for their successful adaptation,"" said professor Ran Barkai in a statement .
Barkai continued: ""Neanderthals depended on mammoths for their very existence. They say you are what you eat. This was especially true of Neanderthals; they ate mammoths but were apparently also genetically similar to mammoths.""
Published in the scientific journal, Human Biology , the research looked at the three cases of varying genes and alleles – alternate forms of genes that stem from mutations – that are generally associated with adapting to colder climates and found that there are enough similarities between the two species.
""Our observations present the likelihood of resemblance between numerous molecular variants that resulted in similar cold-adapted epigenetic traits of two species, both of which evolved in Eurasia from an African ancestor,"" Tel Aviv University professor and the study&apos;s co-author, Meidad Kislev, explained. ""These remarkable findings offer supporting evidence for the contention regarding the nature of convergent evolution through molecular resemblance, in which similarities in genetic variants between adapted species are present.""
Kislev continued: ""We believe these types of connections can be valuable for future evolutionary research. They&apos;re especially interesting when they involve other large-brained mammals, with long life spans, complex social behavior and their interactions in shared habitats with early humans.""
""It is now possible to try to answer a question no one has asked before: Are there genetic similarities between evolutionary adaptation paths in Neanderthals and mammoths?"" Barkai added. ""The answer seems to be yes. This idea alone opens endless avenues for new research in evolution, archaeology and other disciplines.""
Woolly mammoth advances There has been renewed vigor recently for reintroducing the woolly mammoth into the wild after CBS&apos; ""60 Minutes"" interviewed Russian scientist Sergey Zimov. The 63-year-old Zimov is attempting to recreate the temperatures of the last Ice Age and help combat climate change, possibly with the help of mammoths.
As part of his plan for Pleistocene Park, a nature preserve in Siberia, Zimov wants to stop or slow the carbon dioxide being released from the permafrost in the area, which he believes could be catastrophic to the planet. ""This is a warning to the world because organic matter in the permafrost, plants and animals, has been frozen for hundreds of thousands of years,"" Zimov told the news outlet. ""As it thaws, microbes consume that organic matter and release carbon dioxide and methane, greenhouse gases which contribute to a warmer climate.""

Zimov hopes to reintroduce animals to the area, including bison, lions, horses and potentially mammoths, with the help of Harvard professor George Church, if he gets his way.
Zimov&apos;s son, Nikita, was asked if the mammoth was needed for the project, to which he replied: ""It&apos;s like, do you need your right arm to live and do your job? No, you don&apos;t need it, but with your arm, you will do it better. So, same with mammoth.""
Although the mammoth, which went extinct more than 4,000 years ago due in part to the changing climate and human hunters, is not likely to return anytime soon, there have been some recent advances.
Last month, researchers were able to implant cells from a woolly mammoth that died 28,000 years ago into mouse cells and have them show ""signs of biological [activity]."" However, the researchers cautioned that it&apos;s unlikely the extinct creatures will walk the Earth again anytime soon.
The research, published in Scientific Reports , details how a well-preserved woolly mammoth, found in 2011 in the Siberian permafrost, has begun to show some activity.
""This suggests that, despite the years that have passed, cell activity can still happen and parts of it can be recreated,"" Kei Miyamoto, a member of the team that conducted the work, said in an interview with AFP .
Despite Miyamoto&apos;s comments, some researchers are attempting to bring the mammoth back with the use of gene editing, including the controversial CRISPR gene editing tool.
Church, a Harvard and MIT geneticist and co-founder of CRISPR is the head of the Harvard Woolly Mammoth Revival team , a project that is in attempting to introduce mammoth genes into the Asian elephant for conservation purposes.
""The elephants that lived in the past — and elephants possibly in the future — knocked down trees and allowed the cold air to hit the ground and keep the cold in the winter, and they helped the grass grow and reflect the sunlight in the summer,"" Church told Live Science in May 2018 . ""Those two [factors] combined could result in a huge cooling of the soil and a rich ecosystem.""

Secret Service under fire after agent testifies agency inserted malicious thumb drive into computer,www.foxnews.com,Lukas Mikelionis,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/secret-service-under-fire-after-agent-testifies-agency-inserted-malicious-thumb-drive-into-computer,"Monday&apos;s revelation about the embattled protection unit came the same day its director, Randolph ""Tex"" Alles, was reported to have been ousted as part of a larger shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security, the government arm to which the Secret Service reports. Alles departure reportedly was not related to the March 30 incident at Mar-a-Lago in which Yujing Zhang, 32, was arrested and charged with unlawfully entering a restricted area and making false statements to federal law enforcement officers. Prosecutors said she isn’t accused of spying at this time, but noted there are ""a lot of questions that remain to be answered.""
She had $8,000 in U.S. and Chinese currency in her hotel room in addition to a signal detector meant to spot hidden cameras, a federal prosecutor in Florida said Monday. Zhang also had in her possession four cellphones, an external hard drive and a thumb drive with computer malware loaded into it.
The malicious thumb drive proved to be a particularly troubling piece of evidence.
Secret Service agent Samuel Ivanovich testified in court that another agent inserted the thumb drive into his computer in an effort to analyze it, prompting the drive to install files without the agent&apos;s consent and corrupt other files on the computer.

“That was something that had never happened before,"" Ivanovich told the judge, adding the agent, who was not identified, then shut down the computer to avoid further damage.
Security experts scolded the Secret Service for failing to follow one of the first rules of cybersecurity.
“Sounds like an agent trying to crack the case before the cyber team got there,” Eric O’Neill, a former FBI surveillance expert, tweeted.
“You don’t put an unknown USB into your computer,” Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer at Veracode, told the Daily Beast . “That’s in all the training everyone gets, even in your dumb corporate training. You even tell your mom that.”
“You don’t put an unknown USB into your computer. That’s in all the training everyone gets, even in your dumb corporate training. You even tell your mom that.”
— Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer at Veracode The Secret Service declined to comment to Fox News on Tuesday morning, citing the ongoing investigation.
But a source with knowledge of the investigation told Fox News that the court testimony did not accurately reflect the incident.
The source said the thumb drive’s forensic analysis was conducted on a standalone computer in accordance with protocol and added the Secret Service&apos;s network was never at risk of malware introduction, as the computer wasn’t connected to the network.
But some experts questioned this explanation, noting there would have been no reason to stop the spread of malware by shutting down the computer if the drive had been analyzed in accordance with protocol. Instead, letting the malware continue to spread on the standalone computer would have allowed analysts to gather more information about it.
Zhang is currently being held until her bond hearing resumes April 15 in West Palm Beach federal court. Prosecutors said the woman would present a ""serious risk of flight"" if she was released.
Officials say Zhang approached a checkpoint at Mar-a-Lago and told a Secret Service agent she wanted to use the pool, even though she was not wearing a bathing suit. She was carrying two Chinese passports, which she showed as identification.

On Tuesday, April 10, the Labor Department reports on job openings and labor turnover for February. (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic, File) WASHINGTON – The number of available jobs in the U.S. fell sharply in February after reaching a record level the previous month, a sign that businesses may pull back a bit on hiring. The Labor Department says job openings fell 7.1% to 7.1 million, the lowest level in nearly a year. The number of people quitting their jobs was nearly unchanged.
The figures suggest the job market is still solid but also echo the mild slowdown in hiring that has occurred so far this year. Employers have added an average of 180,000 jobs a month in the first three months this year, down from nearly 225,000 last year. Still, that level of hiring is enough to lower the unemployment rate, currently 3.8%, over time. Trending in US"
Students at Baylor University try to shut down Matt Walsh's talk about Christian values,www.foxnews.com,Caleb Parke,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/students-at-baylor-university-try-to-shut-down-matt-walshs-talk-about-christian-values,"Some Baylor students, however, are demanding Walsh&apos;s speech be shut down because of his ""anti-LGBTQ"" views, according to a Change.org petition that has garnered over 2,200 signatures as of Tuesday morning. ""This cannot be allowed to take place,"" the petition reads. ""Please remove this from campus events. For the benefit of all LGBTQ+ students, alumni, and future students, this harmful hate speech must be kept off of our beloved campus.""
But Walsh said this shutting down of free speech, let alone at a Christian university in Texas of all places, is nothing new.
""You think that people would at least be open to hearing the message,"" Walsh told ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday morning. ""We know the situation on college campuses, where often times opposing viewpoints are not welcome and students don&apos;t know how to deal with someone presenting a point of view that&apos;s foreign to them.""
Although Baylor is a Christian institution, Walsh points out, there are many ""Christian-in-name-only"" schools, especially when it comes to the culture on campus. He said many are ""openly hostile to Christianity.""
The Daily Wire contributor was invited to Baylor by the Young Americans for Freedom chapter on campus, and, despite the petition, Baylor officials support Walsh coming to campus.
""While Baylor is a university that supports and encourages free speech, we have an additional...responsibility as a Christian university..to appreciate differing opinions and backgrounds in a respectful and compassionate manner that extends grace as Christ did. We may not always agree, but we are still the Baylor Family,"" Linda Livingstone, Baylor University president, wrote in a statement. ""And we all need to do better.""
Walsh notes that if students are hurt by his presence or words on campus, they don&apos;t have to attend the speech.
""I hope that people who disagree come to the speech and, at least, hear me out,"" Walsh said. ""I hope they&apos;ll walk away realizing that it&apos;s possible to be pro-life, it&apos;s possible to be pro-traditional marriage and not hate anyone.""
In February, another Christian school, Grand Canyon University, disinvited YAF speaker Ben Shapiro before reversing its decision .

'Hysteria Doesn't Make Facts Disappear': Tucker on Obama Defending Assimilation of Immigrants - Fox News Insider,insider.foxnews.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://insider.foxnews.com/2019/04/09/tucker-carlson-barack-obama-defending-assimilation-immigrants,"by Fox News Insider
Tucker Carlson said new comments by former President Barack Obama and Sen. Bernie Sanders show how far to the left some Democrats have moved on immigration and border security.
Speaking in Berlin over the weekend, Obama suggested some on the left have gone too far with accusations of racism against the other side.
Obama said:
I worry sometimes when, as we think about how to deal with the immigration issue, we think that any moves towards assimilation of the existing newcomers to the existing culture is somehow a betrayal. Should we want to encourage newcomers to learn the language of the country they are moving to? Of course. Does that mean they can never use their own language? No. Of course it doesn't mean that. But it's not racist to say, 'Ah, if you're going to be here, then you should learn the language of the country you just arrived at.'

Carlson said it used to be a generally accepted fact that countries must have borders, but now it's considered a form of ""hate speech"" by some.
""Only under the reign of the modern left has it become forbidden to say what is true about immigration and a hundred other topics. But the truth itself has not changed. It won't. Hysteria doesn't make facts disappear,"" he said.
Meantime, at an event Sunday in Iowa, Sanders pushed back on a member of the audience who referred to him as ""an advocate for open borders."" Sen. Bernie Sanders campaigns in Oskaloosa, IA: ""If you open the borders, there's a lot of poverty in this world, and you're going to have people from all over the world.

""If your point is you open the borders, my God, you know, there is a lot of poverty in this world, you are going to have people from all over the world. And I don't think that's something that we can do at this point. Can't do it,"" the 2020 presidential candidate responded.
Carlson said instead of being accused of racism for his comment, perhaps Sanders ""cares about what happens to America,"" as all of our elected leaders should.
""We don't elect them to improve Mexico, or China or Europe -- no offense against those countries. We put them in office so they will look out for this country and us. ... More than anything, Americans want secure borders. But they're not getting any of that -- and so resentment is building. And why wouldn't it?""

"Rep. Mike Kelly: The IRS should be a resource, not an adversary",www.foxnews.com,Mike Kelly,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rep-mike-kelly-the-irs-should-be-a-resource-not-your-adversary,"From cradle to grave, whether we want to or not, American taxpayers will have a continuous relationship with the IRS . That relationship is often stressful, however, and the fact that the agency is one of the most visible and powerful in our government makes interactions with it intimidating for regular Americans. Regardless of age or income, the IRS will always play a role in the lives of taxpayers. At every stage of life, it should be a helpful role, whether it be a confused 16-year-old with his or her first W-2, a working mom filing for the annual child tax credit, or a senior citizen who has a question regarding a health savings account.
Unfortunately, the last time Congress reformed the IRS to provide better service was 1998. The world certainly looks a lot different than it did 20 years ago. In 1998, Armageddon was the top movie, Meg Ryan was impatiently waiting for her dial-up modem to connect to the internet to see if Tom Hanks had sent her an email in You’ve Got Mail, and Mark Zuckerberg had not yet created Facebook in his college dorm room.
Today, Americans would not tolerate 1998’s internet speeds or means of communication, and they should not have to endure the IRS of 1998. Given the IRS’s role in every stage of an American’s life, it is imperative that the IRS of today align with the taxpayer of today. Whether it be online, in person, or on the phone, the IRS should meet taxpayers where they are. The agency should work for them.
That is why I am a co-author of the Taxpayer First Act, which the House of Representatives will consider today. The bill sets forth a bold new vision for the IRS of the future. Over the last two years, Democrats and Republicans have reached across the aisle to figure out how to make the IRS a service-first agency – one that works for the taxpayer, including low-income taxpayers.
If signed into law, our bill will bring the IRS into the 21st century by recasting its mission to service-first. It would mandate a complete restructuring of the IRS to improve efficiency, enhance cybersecurity, and better meet the needs of taxpayers. It would also require the IRS to develop a comprehensive customer service strategy based on best practices from the private sector.
As we approach Tax Day, we are hopeful that we can make it a little less scary for you.
To better help taxpayers interacting with the IRS, the plan would also create an independent appeals process, providing taxpayers a fair hearing when they have a dispute with the IRS. We are also putting in place additional safeguards around IRS enforcement tools, ensuring that they are only used when necessary and without abuse. Our plan protects low-income taxpayers by extending the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Matching Grant Program (VITA), which provides tax preparation assistance.
Additionally, the bill will make sure low-income taxpayers are not referred to private debt collectors and are provided access to information about qualified low-income taxpayer clinics.
Finally, the IRS cannot become a first-class agency without state-of-the-art information technology (IT). Billions of dollars have been wasted on IT upgrades, and our plan puts the IRS’ efforts to modernize itself back on track and ensures stronger accountability if those efforts fall short. Our plan also provides the IRS with better tools to combat identity theft, strengthening partnerships with states and the private sector.
So, as we approach Tax Day, we are hopeful that we can make it a little less scary for you. When you have a tax question, we want your first thought to be, “Not a problem. I’ll check the IRS website, walk into an IRS office, or pick up the phone and call.”
We also hope that when you do so, you’ll be confident that the IRS is there to help you and your family. We want the agency to be viewed as a resource, not an adversary. We are hopeful that the Senate will take up and pass this important legislation, and that President Trump will sign it. That will be a critical step toward restoring Americans’ faith in the IRS.

published 2019-04-09 11:16:07 by Adam Shaw A caravan-size influx of migrants is flooding across the border each week in just a single sector, a top Border Patrol official told lawmakers Tuesday — the latest indicator of the growing migration crisis on the southern border. “Much media attention has focused on caravans coming across from Central America,” Rio Grande Valley Sector Chief Patrol Agent Rodolfo Karisch said at a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing. “But the fact is that RGV is receiving caravan-equivalent numbers every seven days.”
TRUMP VISITS SOUTHERN BORDER AMID GROWING CRISIS, DECLARING THAT ‘OUR COUNTRY IS FULL’
Karisch said his sector has apprehended people from 50 different countries, including China, Bangladesh, Turkey, Egypt and Romania.
“People are traveling across hemispheres to attempt to illegally enter the U.S., using the same pathways as the Central Americans,” he said.
Karisch noted that Border Patrol has apprehended more families illegally crossing the border in the first five months of fiscal 2019 than during all of fiscal 2018. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) apprehended more than 76,000 migrants across the border in February and said it was on track to apprehend more than 100,000 in March.
In the Rio Grande Valley alone, Karisch said that at current pace, they would have more than 260,000 apprehensions in his sector by the end of fiscal 2019. There were 162,000 in RGV last year. He also said that his agents apprehend, on average, 1,000 people a day.
Karisch’s testimony is the latest warning from officials that there is an escalating crisis at the border. President Trump, who declared a national emergency at the border in February, traveled to the border on Friday and repeated his warnings that he is prepared to close the border if Congress and Mexico do not act to close loopholes and stop migrant flows — though he has indicated such an action is not imminent.
Last week, Obama-era Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan told senators on Thursday that the U.S. is “experiencing a crisis at the southern border at a magnitude never seen in modern times.”
Karisch on Tuesday gave a similarly dour assessment, saying that in 30 years as an agent, “I have never witnessed the conditions we are currently facing on the southwest border.”
OBAMA’S BORDER CHIEF WARNS CONGRESS: IMMIGRATION CRISIS ‘AT A MAGNITUDE NEVER SEEN IN MODERN TIMES’
“This is not a manufactured crisis created by those of us who live and work in the border area. Border Patrol continues to apprehend record numbers of people who purposely violate U.S. immigration laws, we are taken advantage of by gaps in our legal frameworks and that undermine the rule of laws.”

Karisch’s remarks come as Trump is shaking up leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, apparently to take a tougher stance on illegal immigration. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned on Sunday and last week Trump abruptly pulled the nomination of Ron Vitiello to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), saying he wanted to go “in a tougher direction.”
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Trump recently told White House adviser Stephen Miller, one of the White House’s hardliners on immigration, that “you’re in charge” of immigration policy."
Barr reveals he is reviewing ‘conduct’ of FBI’s original Russia probe,www.foxnews.com,Brooke Singman,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-reveals-he-is-reviewing-conduct-of-fbis-original-russia-probe,"Barr: Full Mueller report with redactions will be released within a week Appearing before a House subcommittee hearing, Attorney General William Barr explains to lawmakers how redactions will be identified and says his timetable for a mid-April release still stands. Attorney General William Barr revealed Tuesday that he is reviewing the “conduct” of the FBI’s original Russia investigation during the summer of 2016, following calls from Republicans to investigate the origins of the probe. Barr testified before a congressional panel in what was his first Capitol Hill appearance since revealing the central findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Barr was grilled by Democrats on the handling of that summary, which stated the special counsel found no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election -- but he was also questioned about the initial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants approved to surveil members of the Trump campaign.
BARR VOWS MUELLER REPORT RELEASE 'WITHIN A WEEK,' AS DEMS RIP 'UNACCEPTABLE' HANDLING AT HEATED HEARING
Barr explained that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has a pending investigation into the FISA warrants and said the probe will be complete by May or June. He then confirmed he's personally reviewing the investigation itself.
“More generally, I am reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted in the summer of 2016,” Barr testified.
The comments come after House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said over the weekend he was preparing to send eight criminal referrals to the Justice Department this week regarding alleged misconduct by DOJ and FBI officials during the Trump-Russia investigation. It is unclear whom Nunes will refer for investigation, and what the process at the Justice Department might be.
When asked Tuesday about Nunes’ referrals, Barr said he hasn’t seen them yet, but, “Obviously, if there is a predicate for investigation, it will be conducted.”
Barr’s review could dovetail with the work U.S. Attorney John Huber has been doing. In 2017, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions appointed Huber to review not only alleged surveillance abuses by the Justice Department and the FBI but also the handling of the probe into the Clinton Foundation and other matters.
ON OFFENSE IN RUSSIA PROBE, TRUMP URGED TO CONSIDER NEW SPECIAL COUNSEL, CRIMINAL REFERRALS
But Republicans have expressed concern about Huber’s investigation, saying he’s made little progress and has not interviewed individuals they believed he should. Republicans, including President Trump, have only stepped up calls to investigate the origins of the Russia investigation with the completion of the Mueller investigation.
The day following Barr’s release of his summary of the Mueller report, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham , R-S.C., said his panel would investigate alleged FISA abuses at the start of the Russia investigation and called on Barr to appoint a new special counsel to investigate “the other side of the story.” Graham has been calling for a second special counsel since 2017 to investigate “whether or not a counterintelligence investigation was opened as a back door to spy on the Trump campaign.”
NUNES TO SEND EIGHT CRIMINAL REFERRALS TO DOJ CONCERNING LEAKS, CONSPIRACY AMID RUSSIA PROBE
Days later, Fox News learned that the president was enthusiastic about the idea of appointing a second special counsel. The president has repeatedly tweeted support for a review of some kind.
The investigation was formally opened by Peter Strzok, a former senior counterintelligence agent, during the summer of 2016. Former FBI counsel Lisa Page, with whom Strzok was romantically involved, revealed during a closed-door congressional interview that the FBI “knew so little” about whether allegations against the Trump campaign were “true or not true,” at the time that they opened the probe, noting that they had just “a paucity of evidence because we are just starting down the path” of vetting the allegations. Page later said that it was “entirely common” that the FBI would begin a counterintelligence investigation with just a “small amount of evidence.”
The FBI, at the time, was led by former Director James Comey and former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe -- both fired by the Trump administration.
Meanwhile, Barr vowed Tuesday to release the Mueller report to the public ""within a week.""
“Right now the special counsel is working with us. This process is going along very well and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid-April stands,"" Barr testified. ""From my standpoint, within a week, I will be in a position to release the report to the public and then I will engage with both chairmen of Judiciary Committees on any requests that they have.""
Barr said that he identified four areas of the report that he believed should be redacted, including grand jury material, information the intelligence community believes would reveal intelligence sources and methods, any material that could interfere with ongoing prosecutions, and information that could implicate the privacy or reputational interests of “peripheral players.”
Barr said that the Justice Department, with the help of the special counsel's office, plans to “color code the decisions from the report and provide explanatory notes describing the basis for each redaction.”
Barr maintained that he is working ""diligently to make as much information as possible available to Congress.""

During the appearance, fans were shocked to see the actor without his iconic mustache and beard. Even Harington, 32, poked fun at himself during the show, specifically during his opening monologue.
“I’ve just shaved my beard so this is more of a pre-pubescent Jon Snow,” he joked, adding “This is Jon Snow if he suddenly played for the Yankees.”
During his opening, Harington also took questions for “audience members” who, in reality, were other “Thrones” stars such as Emilia Clarke and Rose Leslie, who is also Harington’s wife.
“How soon can you grow back the beard?” Leslie asked.
Twitter users, too, were quick to comment on the smooth-faced actor.
“Kit Harington without his beard is a visual attack and I don&apos;t care for it one bit,” one user wrote.
Another user paralleled Harington to “Bobby Moynihan if he did KETO.”
“Kit Harington looks like a 12-year-old without his beard,” another said.
""Kit Harington needs to always have a beard,” wrote another.
“Yo Kit Harington without a beard is a sin,” added a user, while another wrote: “Kit Harington without a beard is just... plz grow back.”
That said, some fans were pleased with the actor&apos;s new look.
""Kit Harington without a beard is a look,"" wrote one woman.
""Kit Harington without a beard is [heart-eyes emoji].""
""Kit Harington is still hot without the beard, y&apos;all are just over dramatic and mean.""

Florida school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz’s cryptic love letters from jail to UK woman revealed,www.foxnews.com,Katherine Lam,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-school-shooting-suspect-nikolas-cruzs-cryptic-love-letters-from-jail-to-uk-woman-revealed,"Love letters written from jail by confessed Parkland shooter released Nikolas Cruz talks about his dreams for a future in love letters written from jail to a girl from the U.K. named Miley, which were released by the Broward State Attorney's Office. Parkland massacre gunman Nikolas Cruz wrote love letters from jail to a woman in the United Kingdom detailing his desire to get married and have children named after guns, while also contemplating death and the death penalty — all while avoiding writing a single word about the 17 people he murdered Feb. 14, 2018. Cruz’s handwritten letters are peppered with drawings and misspelled words and addressed to a woman named ""Miley,"" a cyber-supporter who helped start the Facebook group “The First Victim,” in reference to Cruz, the Sun-Sentinel reported.
Cruz says in one letter that talking about the deadly shooting he confessed to carrying out at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School a year ago “would be a bad idea,” but advises Miley to listen to Foster the People’s song “Pumped Up Kicks,” which is about a school shooting. It includes the lyrics: “All the other kids with the pumped up kicks/You'd better run, better run, out run my gun.”
NIKOLAS CRUZ, PARKLAND SCHOOL SHOOTER, MIGHT GO ON TRIAL IN EARLY 2020, JUDGE SAYS
The now-20-year-old touches on several topics, including the remote possibility he's released from jail one day and can have a family.
“I also want to know if you would be at my trial or [illegible]. I’m hoping you are because I really want to meet you and it would make me happy,” Cruz writes.
Parkland school suspect Nikolas Cruz listens during a hearing at the Broward Courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Friday. (AP)
“I also was wondering if you’d be interested in marriage when the time comes. It won’t be for a long time, but would you be interested? I feel like we make a great family together. With lots of kids. I imagine it every day. That’s what’s keeping me strong,” he scribbles in another letter.
Cruz also talks about “long-lasting” love, describing it as “love that will last forever even when I’m gone…To be honest with you, I think it will never happen.”
FLORIDA SCHOOL BOARD VOTES NOT TO FIRE EMBATTLED STONEMAN DOUGLAS SUPERINTENDENT
Cruz asks Miley if she wants to have children one day.
“I really want kids. I think of it all the time, you know the joy they bring,” he writes. “Do you want children? I want 3 boys and girls. Maybe more LOL. The boys’ names will be Kalashnikov, Makarov and Remington,” in reference to types of guns. Video
The accused killer, despite talking about life after prison, reflects on death and being sentenced to the death penalty. He describes death as a “forever darkness or a flash of light.”
“I wish life for me could have been different but it’s not. And a part of me is wishing it ends. End with the death [penalty], letting someone inject me with longlast sleep. It's kind of what I want but I’m unsure of myself so I’m just letting people save me from myself, saving me from something that I can never return from,” he writes.
He writes in another letter: “I’ll never be loved and I’ll die alone.”
SECOND STUDENT WHO SURVIVED FLORIDA SCHOOL SHOOTING DIES IN APPARENT SUICIDE, POLICE SAY
Cruz talks about supporting the Second Amendment and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the 2018 election.
“I can’t spell his name, but I know he’s Republican and I’m voting for him. I believe if we get a Democratic governor, he will take away our rights, and hope that won’t happen,” he says.
Defense attorney Melisa McNeill speaks with Parkland school suspect Nikolas Cruz during a hearing at the Broward Courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
He also mentions the Pittsburgh Synagogue shooting that left 11 people dead last October.
“I put my heart out to these victims and to the shooter because I believe they need all the support they can get,” he writes, according to WSVN .
It’s unclear if Miley wrote letters back to Cruz.

Housing vouchers ending for Hurricane Michael survivors,www.foxnews.com,MIKE SCHNEIDER,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/housing-vouchers-ending-for-hurricane-michael-survivors,"Email
FILE - This Oct. 9, 2018, file photo shows a satellite image made available by NOAA showing Hurricane Michael, center, in the Gulf of Mexico. Hundreds of residents in the county hardest hit by Hurricane Michael are losing housing vouchers that allowed them to stay at hotels in the aftermath of the Category 4 storm. Around 250 households in Bay County, Florida, are facing eviction from hotels Tuesday, April 9, 2019 since their vouchers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Transitional Sheltering Assistance program were ending. (NOAA via AP, File) ORLANDO, Fla. – Hundreds of residents in the county hardest hit by Hurricane Michael faced losing a roof over their heads on Tuesday as housing vouchers allowing them to stay at hotels after the Category 4 storm expired. Around 250 households in Bay County, Florida, faced eviction from hotels since their vouchers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Transitional Sheltering Assistance program were over as of Tuesday, a day before the six-month anniversary of the hurricane's landfall in Florida's Panhandle.
The state of Florida has appealed, asking for an extension of three more months.
""It's unacceptable to us,"" Bay County Commission chairman Philip Griffitts said Tuesday. ""These are not wealthy folks. These are just regular, run-of-the-mill Americans who really need help.""
Denying the extension will increase the risk that residents will leave Bay County, with housing still in short supply six months after the storm blew ashore, said Jared Moskowitz, director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
""The availability of affordable housing and the lack of it right now is an issue,"" Moskowitz said in an interview. ""We're just asking them to think out of the box on this.""
FEMA said the vouchers aren't a long-term solution for residents.
""When families receive lodging assistance from FEMA, it is explained that it is a short-term sheltering option and that they are expected to develop a longer-term housing solution for their family in order to successfully transition out of the hotels,"" FEMA spokeswoman Kathryn Van Marter-Sanders said in a statement.
FEMA said 292 families were still in hotels as of Monday, and of those, 42 families would still get vouchers to stay another two months in hotels since they had plans for long-term housing. The policy might seem paradoxical, but FEMA officials said it has encouraged most of the more than 2,000 households who used the vouchers in the past six months to find more permanent housing.
In most disasters, survivors get help from case managers who help them with any needs through FEMA's Disaster Case Management program, but the program has yet to be implemented, Moskowitz said in a letter to FEMA on Monday.
Also adding to the problem is the large number of apartment dwellers who lost their homes. More than two-thirds of residents whose homes were damaged lived in apartments.
""Housing is not a simple situation. Repairing apartments with no roofs can't be done overnight,"" Griffitts said. ""There's just simply no affordable housing.""

The two story, stucco-faced home previously featured 10 bedrooms divided into five apartment units, House Beautiful reports, and has now been renovated into a single home for the growing family, with the removal of several interior walls.
Swanky improvements reportedly include the installation of new fireplaces, an eco-boiler and childproof-paned windows, as well as a “huge” kitchen and a yoga room, plus a special bedroom for Doria Ragland, Markle’s mother, as per ITV.

The move to Frogmore Cottage on the grounds of Windsor Estate brings the couple 20 miles away from their former home in Kensington Palace in London, formally splitting from Prince William’s household.
""Windsor is a very special place for their royal highnesses and they are grateful that their official residence will be on the estate,” reps for the royal family said in November, when the news was announced.
Video The grounds of the Sussex’s new, more private property are quite sentimental. The so-called cottage is not far from Frogmore House, the grand 17th century manor where Meghan and Harry celebrated their evening wedding reception for 200 merrymakers in May 2018.
The cottage and house were christened “Frogmore” because of the many frogs that resided in the marshy area near the River Thames.
It remains to be seen whether the royal couple shares photos of the charming new residence with their 4.3 million Instagram followers.

Dad of man killed by illegal immigrant blasts California Gov. Newsom's trip to Central America: 'It's disgusting',www.foxnews.com,Talia Kaplan,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dad-of-man-killed-by-illegal-immigrant-blasts-california-gov-newsoms-trip-to-central-america-its-disgusting,"'It's disgusting': Dad of man killed by illegal immigrant blasts California Gov. Newsom's trip to Central America A man whose son was killed by an illegal immigrant driver in San Francisco has criticized California Gov. Gavin Newsom for putting illegal immigrants ahead of residents of his own state with a planned tripped to Central America. “Our government has betrayed us, President Obama betrayed us, Gavin Newsom , Jerry Brown, almost every legislator in California has put illegal aliens ahead of American citizens and the results are a lot of crime and a lot of death,” Dan Rosenberg told “ Fox & Friends ” Tuesday.
Rosenberg made the comments as Gov. Newsom is on a four-day trip to El Salvador to learn more about the root cause of why Central American migrants make the arduous journey to the United States.
CALIFORNIA GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM PLANS CENTRAL AMERICA TRIP TO EXAMINE 'ROOT CAUSES OF MIGRATION'
Newsom, a Democrat, is in the country, just as President Donald Trump and U.S. border officials are calling for tougher security measures amid a spike in Central American migrants attempting to enter the U.S. through Mexico. The president recently moved to cut direct aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, whose citizens are fleeing north and overwhelming U.S. resources -- including as part of organized caravans that the White House has warned may eventually lead to the closure of the entire southern border with Mexico.
Newsom has publicly criticized the president’s actions. During his El Salvador trip Newsom said: “Right now you have a president that talks down to people, talks past them, demoralizing folks living here and their relatives in the United States.”
Rosenberg, the president of Advocates for Victims of Illegal Alien Crime, a nonprofit organization with the goal of promoting “American's safeness from illegal alien crime,” called Newsom’s trip “a political stunt.”
He added: “He (Newsom) says he’s going down there to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I think he needs to travel around California and get a better understanding of what illegal immigration has done to the state.”
DAD'S GRIEF LEADS TO QUEST TO COUNT DEATHS CAUSED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT DRIVERS
Rosenberg’s son Drew was killed after Roberto Galo, an unlicensed illegal immigrant, struck him as he was riding his motorcycle in San Francisco on Nov. 16, 2010. Galo, a Honduran, who entered the country illegally but earned temporary protective status, then ran over Rosenberg twice in his frenzied effort to flee the scene.
Galo had been cited five months earlier for driving without a license or insurance and heading the wrong way on a one-way street in San Francisco. His car was impounded for a day, he paid a fine for the moving violation and the other charges were dropped.
“Newsom is one of the three people that I consider directly related to my son’s death,” said Rosenberg. “He was the mayor of San Francisco when my son was killed. It was his policy a year before that if you are in the country illegally you can drive in San Francisco without a license and the guy who killed my son was caught prior to that and they just dropped the charges, let him go, and he continued to drive until he killed my son.”

He added: “Newsom, he’s ignoring his own state, and worrying about everything else. Look, he’s posturing for a run for presidency, he’s not going to run right now, but if Trump wins another term, he’ll be running in 2024 and that’s what he is doing right now.

Suspects arrested in kidnapping of American tourist and guide in Uganda,www.foxnews.com,Anna Hopkins,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/suspects-arrested-in-kidnapping-of-american-tourist-and-guide-in-uganda,"An unknown number of people were apprehended in the Kanungu district, which neighbors the national park, as ""raids and extensive searches"" continue for more involved. In a tweet, the Uganda Police Force thanked the US Embassy and Tourism sector for their commitment to freeing the two and holding those responsible for the kidnapping responsible. Reports on how many suspects were in custody differ and authorities have yet to provide an official number. Endicott and Mirenge were released Sunday after being kidnapped at gunpoint nearly a week earlier at the Queen Elizabeth National Park and held for a $500,000 ransom. On Monday, Endicott met with the U.S. Ambassador to Uganda in the country&apos;s capital of Kampala.
The arrests Tuesday come just hours after President Trump tweeted Monday to urge police to locate and arrest those responsible for the kidnapping.
“Uganda must find the kidnappers of the American Tourist and guide before people will feel safe in going there. Bring them to justice openly and quickly!” Trump wrote.
Endicott, an aesthetician in her 50s from Costa Mesa, Calif., came to Uganda to go on a safari because it was her life-long dream to see gorillas in the wild, her friend said. While out in the park with Remezo and two others, armed gunmen held up the van they were in, took the keys to the safari vehicle and left with Endicott and Remezo, leaving the two other tourists behind.,
Although it was first reported that no ransom was given in exchange for the safe return of Endicott and Ramezo, a Ugandan tour official said on the condition of anonymity that an amount of ransom was, in fact, paid for Endicott&apos;s freedom. Still, the ransom payment continues to be disputed by officials on the record.
Remezo has not yet been reunited with his family, CBS News reported, and he did not travel to Kampala with Endicott on Monday.
