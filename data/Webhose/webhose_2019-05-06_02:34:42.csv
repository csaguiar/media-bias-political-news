The mid 20th century racial classification by American anthropologist Carleton S. CO ON , divided humanity into five races:
Caucasoid (White) race.
Negroid (Black) race.
Capoid (Bushmen/Hottentots) race.
Mongoloid (Oriental/ Amerindian) race.
Australoid (Australian Aborigine and Papuan) race.
Any one notice no Hispanics race? They are clumped in with Caucasoid. Same with Italians and many other ethnic groups.

I do believe that Virginia will win,because of that added incentive for vindication, that will not show up on the score sheet. Wins against Auburn and Purdue were truly miraculous. We all know God is impartial in any contest. Yet their personal faith has helped Virginia take last year's failure and use it as a springboard for this year's success.

Education Privatizers Have Gone Global. So Must We If We Want to Stop Them,www.commondreams.org,Christian Addai-Poku,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/07/education-privatizers-have-gone-global-so-must-we-if-we-want-stop-them,"The fight for public education reminds us that working-class struggles around the world are linked‚Äîand that international solidarity is the key to victory
by Christian Addai-Poku , Michael Galant 0 Comments Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft and co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, speaks during the Politico 'Lessons from Leaders' series at the Bank of America offices September 29, 2014 in Washington, DC. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
In February 2018, West Virginia teachers launched a strike that reawakened a movement. Tens of thousands of teachers from around the country have taken part in what is now the largest strike wave in decades, demanding better public education in the face of years of austerity.
The fight for public education reminds us that working-class struggles around the world are linked‚Äîand that international solidarity is the key to victory.
On Feb. 11, 2019, as the U.S. wave continued, teachers union leaders from across Africa gathered in Addis Ababa for a meeting of African Union heads of state with their own demands: to halt the continent‚Äôs moves toward privatized education and provide ‚Äúinclusive and equitable quality free public education for all.‚Äù
Though an ocean apart, West Virginia and Addis Ababa are two fronts in the same war. The fight for public education reminds us that working-class struggles around the world are linked‚Äîand that international solidarity is the key to victory.
In many U.S. districts, school funding still hasn‚Äôt recovered from cuts made during the Great Recession. Teachers are underpaid, classrooms are overcrowded, and textbooks are out of date. Rather than increase funding, conservative public figures like Betsy DeVos, Trump‚Äôs secretary of education, have turned to private and charter schools that deepen inequality and further drain resources from the public system.
At the same time, foreign-owned, for-profit schools like Bridge International Academies and GEMS Education have swept Africa. There is no doubt that the status quo of public education in much of the region is dire: Education systems are largely underfunded, illiteracy remains high, and a large gender gaps prevail . But an unaccountable, profit-driven system funded largely by American and European investors is not the solution . Private schools crowd out the public sector, base education on ability to pay, and exacerbate economic and social stratification.
Investors like Bridge‚Äôs digital Taylorist curricula, which are identical across all schools, planned down to the minute, and require specialized tablets that track the finger movements of their teachers. However, there‚Äôs little evidence that such lessons adequately serve poor and working-class students. School privatization in Africa is part of the same neoliberal project that inspired teachers to walk out in West Virginia.
Milton Friedman‚Äîfree market ideologue, adviser to both Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, and mentor of the ‚Äú Chicago Boys ‚Äù‚Äîis considered the founding father of the school choice movement in the United States. It was his brand of market fundamentalism that was then foisted on the Global South in the 1980s, leading to Africa‚Äôs ‚Äúlost decade‚Äù of growth and the continent‚Äôs current state of education. International Monetary Fund austerity demands inevitably forced public funding cuts while the World Bank pushed school fees and privatization. The World Bank , along with international aid agencies like the United Kingdom‚Äôs Department for International Development , continue to promote for-profit models even today.
Philanthrocapitalist Bill Gates has given roughly $10 million to a fund attempting to push Oakland to the ""New Orleans"" model: full privatization.
In some cases, privatization efforts in the United States and Africa are led by the very same billionaires and corporations. Philanthrocapitalist Bill Gates has given roughly $10 million to a fund attempting to push Oakland to the ‚ÄúNew Orleans‚Äù model: full privatization. It is no coincidence that Gates is also one of the top funders behind Bridge. Pearson, the controversial education giant of Common Core fame, holds stakes in both Bridge and the comparable Omega Schools in Ghana.
These are more than theoretical ties. These are proof that we are in the same fight.
In 2016, Ugandan courts ruled that Bridge was not adequately licensed to operate and ordered the closure of its 63 schools in the country. Shortly thereafter, 10 Bridge schools were shuttered in Kenya, thanks in part to sustained pressure from the Kenya National Union of Teachers. Ghanaian teachers are now pushing for the same.
Since the beginning of the strike wave in the United States, teachers have won vastly improved contracts, including pay raises and increased school spending, in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Arizona, Colorado, Los Angeles, and Oakland.
Each of these victories is a blow against the global education privatization movement. Each is a material loss for funders like Gates and Pearson, and a political loss for DeVos and her sympathizers at the World Bank. Each builds the power of global union federations like Education International. And each fuels mobilization for further victories.
A court ruling against Bridge International in Kenya is a win against ‚Äúschool choice‚Äù in the United States. A teachers‚Äô strike in West Virginia is a success for public education in Africa.
The U.S. labor movement must not retreat into economic nationalism, winning material gains for American workers while abandoning those beyond its borders. The workers of the world are a part of the same fight. To win the war, a revitalized Left must transcend borders‚Äîbuilding global solidarity not out of altruism, but from an understanding that the struggle of the working class is global .

Our First Amendment Rights Are Under Assault With the Global Gag Rule,www.commondreams.org,Jonathan Cohen,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/07/our-first-amendment-rights-are-under-assault-global-gag-rule,"The Trump administration is dismantling women's health and rights
by Jonathan Cohen , Kavita Ramdas 0 Comments White House adviser Ivanka Trump announced she is planning a trip to Africa to ""economically empower"" women in the very same countries where the Trump administration is simultaneously dismantling women's health and rights. (Photo: Charlotte Cooper /flickr/cc)
On Wednesday White House adviser Ivanka Trump announced she is planning a trip to Africa to promote a global women‚Äôs initiative she is leading. Her goal is to ‚Äúeconomically empower‚Äù 50 million women in developing countries by 2025 at the cost of $100 million.
As Ivanka embarks on her plan to help support women in Africa, the Trump administration is simultaneously dismantling women‚Äôs health and rights in the very same countries Ivanka will be visiting.
Just last week Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took steps to dramatically expand the implementation of the Global Gag Rule‚Äîa policy that prohibits foreign nongovernmental organizations who receive U.S. federal aid from performing or providing information on abortion.
The rule, enacted by every Republican president since Regan, has been catastrophic, imperiling women‚Äôs health, driving up unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions, and contributing to global poverty. The ill effects extend far beyond limiting abortion rights, impacting every facet of reproductive health and constraining NGOs‚Äô ability to lobby for reform.
The new move goes beyond any previous interpretation by other administrations, restricting ‚Äúgagged‚Äù organizations from funding groups that provide abortion services and information, even though those organizations don‚Äôt get any U.S. aid.
It‚Äôs not only an outrageous overreach of an onerous policy that forces organizations to either stay true to their mission and turn down funding from the U.S. government, or comply with a policy that compromises their mandate‚Äîit underscores the antithetical programs coming out of Trump‚Äôs White House in the guise of women‚Äôs empowerment and advancing prosperity for marginalized communities.
It also shows a breathtaking lack of self-awareness by Ivanka and our government. How can her program empower women economically as clinics in their communities shut down and if they can‚Äôt easily access basic items and services like contraceptives and maternal health care? Is gagging abortion advocates meant to empower them?
Research shows that without access to basic reproductive health care, women can‚Äôt thrive economically. Expanding contraceptive use improves women‚Äôs agency, education, and labor force participation. Yet across Africa, there is an unmet need for family planning, and low contraceptive use keeps women from achieving their desired family size, limiting women‚Äôs economic advancement.
While shameful, this is not all that surprising. The White House is dismantling hard-won rights to reproductive health and freedom at home and abroad at a pace unlike any other previous administration. When Trump first reinstated the Global Gag Rule as one of his first executive orders in office in 2017, he applied it to an unprecedented amount of global health assistance funds , resulting in devastating impacts on groups that work on everything from water and sanitation to HIV and AIDS.
Two years later, the Trump administration reinstated the ‚ÄúDomestic Gag Rule,‚Äù an anti-choice policy that bans providers in the U.S. from receiving government funds from referring patients for abortion services. The rule is set to take effect on May 4.
At the Open Society Foundations, we have a long history of fighting for basic human rights, including those to health and equality. We‚Äôve worked to protect and expand reproductive rights across the globe, most recently standing with organizations that overturned Ireland‚Äôs abortion ban. In the U.S., we have supported Planned Parenthood‚Äôs efforts to stave off the closure of clinics and worked to rebuff legislation aimed at chipping away at Roe v. Wade .
When we talk about women‚Äôs empowerment, we mean it.
We have battled against the Global Gag Rule and similar attempts to place unconstitutional restrictions on NGOs‚Äô ability to advocate on health issues for years. When Congress sought to place restrictions on federal funding for groups fighting HIV and AIDS that didn‚Äôt explicitly oppose prostitution, the foundations challenged the act in court. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court found in our favor , ruling that the act violated organizations‚Äô First Amendment rights by mandating that they ‚Äúpledge allegiance to the government‚Äôs policy.‚Äù
We know the damage the Global Gag Rule has wrought on basic human rights and economic development for communities worldwide, and we are committed to minimizing its harms, and seeing that the policy is permanently repealed. As a funder that champions open democratic values and human rights, we will not be gagged, nor will we stand by as the vibrant movements we support are attacked.
If Ivanka wants her program to succeed, she should start by pressuring her own government to repeal the policies that hurt women‚Äôs health and advancement the most.
