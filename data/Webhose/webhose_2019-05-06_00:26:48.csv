Venezuelans protest as Guaido declares 'definitive' escalation,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/venezuelans-protest-as-guaido-declares-defin-587948.html,"Venezuelans Protest As Guaido Declares 'definitive' Escalation Umer Jamshaid 18 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 10:30 AM
Caracas, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido on Saturday launched what he promises will be a ""definitive"" escalation of pressure to force the country's embattled leftist leader from office.
Addressing a giant anti-government rally in Caracas , Guaido -- whose claim to be interim president is supported by around 50 nations -- kicked off what he called ""Operation Liberty,"" his plan to oust President Nicolas Maduro.
""Everyone to the streets, let's start the final phase of the end of the usurpation!"" he told supporters, speaking from the back of a pickup truck.
He called for a huge nationwide turnout on Wednesday, and urged his followers to redouble their efforts to maintain pressure in the streets.
""The greatest escalation of pressure we have seen in our history"" has begun, Guaido said.
The call comes amid massive blackouts and the collapse of water supplies affecting the nation, further exacerbated a growing political crisis.
The United States meanwhile has stiffened its economic sanctions against Maduro, and one top US official warned Venezuela 's military that it must protect the rights of peaceful protesters.
At the rally, Guaido also warned Cuba 's President Miguel Diaz-Canel that the supply of subsidized Venezuelan oil to the Caribbean communist island nation was over.
Venezuela has been sending cheap oil to Cuba in exchange for labor from Cuban doctors and teachers, but Guaido said the oil was actually financing a Cuban intelligence group known as G2 that was cracking down on Maduro opponents in the Venezuelan military.
""The exploitation of Venezuelan oil is over, so Mr Diaz-Canel... Venezuelan oil will not be used to submit and investigate our military officials"" through the G2, he told the crowd.
Pro-Guaido protests drew thousands in rallies across the country on Saturday.
A pro-Maduro counter-demonstration in Caracas with supporters dressed in red drew a large crowd that gathered at the Miraflores presidential palace.
""Together, permanently mobilized, let's keep defending national peace and independence; no more interference!"" Maduro tweeted.
Two opposition deputies were detained at an anti-government demo in the western city of Maracaibo , but a few hours later Guaido announced that the two had been released.
Elimar Diaz, a lawmaker who marched in Maracaibo , told AFP the protest there had encountered ""brutal repression,"" including tear gas canisters dropped from helicopters, the use of National Guard armored vehicles and attacks by members of the pro-government militia, known as ""colectivos.""Diaz said people in Maracaibo had gone ""days without electricity "" amid ""inhumane rationing"" by the government .
Maduro has blamed US-backed sabotage for the massive blackouts that have deprived millions of power. The opposition blames a failure to maintain critical infrastructure. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"
Barca edge closer to La Liga title after beating 10-man Atletico,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/sports/barca-edge-closer-to-la-liga-title-after-beat-587947.html,"Barca Edge Closer To La Liga Title After Beating 10-man Atletico Zeeshan Mehtab 18 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 10:30 AM
Barcelona, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi scored twice in two minutes as Barcelona broke the resistance of 10-man Atletico Madrid on Saturday to go 11 points clear of their La Liga title rivals.
Diego Costa was sent off in the 28th minute at Camp Nou after appearing to insult the referee, Gil Manzano, but while Atletico held on for almost another hour, Suarez and Messi struck late to seal a pivotal 2-0 win.
The victory leaves Barca almost out of sight with seven games left to play and maintains momentum ahead of Wednesday's trip to Manchester United in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-finals.
United's coach Ole Gunnar Solksjaer was in the crowd along with his assistant Mike Phelan but this was a familiar story of Barcelona 's deadly duo delivering when it mattered most.
Costa's early and needless dismissal left Atletico needing snookers just to avoid defeat, let alone pull off the win that their coach Diego Simeone had said was the only result that could keep their challenge alive.
But Suarez intervened with a superb long-range strike in the 85th minute, before Messi added a second in the 86th. The pair have now scored 53 goals between them in La Liga this season.
Only a monumental collapse could now bring Atletico back into contention and more likely is Barca have earned themselves the luxury of resting players, with an even greater focus on success in Europe .
Antoine Griezmann, who decided against joining Barcelona last summer, was whistled as his name was read out before kick-off and he struggled for chances in what quickly became a contest of attack against defence after Costa departed.
Costa headed over and Griezmann shot straight at Marc-Andre ter Stegen early on while for Barcelona , Jordi Alba hit the post after a defence-splitting pass from Messi.
Atletico seemed to be finding their way into the game when Manzano showed red to Costa, who had pursued the referee and seemingly directed an insult towards him after a tangle with Philippe Coutinho.
A fuming Costa was escorted away by Gerard Pique and then Barca took control. Coutinho should have scored after a brilliant backheel by Suarez, who tried the same trick again when perhaps a simpler pass might have teed up Messi.
The Argentinian came alive at the start of the second half as one shot was saved by the excellent Jan Oblak and another mesmeric run ended with a feathered pass to Suarez but again, Oblak saved, this time with his foot.
Finally, the resistance of Oblak and Atletico was broken as Barca scored twice in two minutes. The first was a peach as Suarez lined up a shot from 25 yards and whipped it past the left hand of Oblak into the bottom corner.
The second was a display of Messi magic, his weaving run from the right leaving both Jose Gimenez and Diego Godin on their backs. A tucked finish found its way to finish off the game and, probably, Atletico too."
NY county measles outbreak spotlights vaccine religious exemptions,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/ny-county-measles-outbreak-spotlights-vaccine-587946.html,"NY County Measles Outbreak Spotlights Vaccine Religious Exemptions Mohammad Ali (@ChaudhryMAli88) 18 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 10:30 AM
Haverstraw, United States, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Patricia Schnabel Ruppert, the health commissioner of an outlying New York suburban county, is feeling ""overwhelmed."" Since October she has been waging an uphill fight to quell one of the worst US measles outbreaks in 20 years.
Among her daily battles: having to constantly repeat that the vaccine does not cause other diseases, that it does not lead to autism, and that the practice of using fetal tissue to produce the vaccine ended decades ago.
Pushing back against such ""junk science"" absorbs a good deal of her energy as she works to educate and persuade the 300,000 residents of Rockland County to cooperate with health authorities and alert them to any new cases of disease.
In 27 years of practicing medicine, Ruppert said, this is ""one of the most challenging health crises I have had to deal with."" As of Friday, measles -- officially eliminated from the United States in 2000 -- had struck 167 people in this county along the Hudson River, including nine new cases this week.
Among the six regional outbreaks of measles reported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the leading public health institute in the US, Rockland County's is the most concentrated.
And yet the county has not skimped in throwing resources at the problem.
- Unprecedented measures - Since October , each case has been systematically investigated to determine how many people have been exposed to the ultra-contagious virus.
Those exposed are then contacted to ensure they have been immunized, and if they haven't been, they are then vaccinated.
Dozens of free vaccination clinics have been organized around the county -- including one Friday in the town of Haverstraw -- with 17,654 doses of vaccine administered to date .
The objective is to raise the vaccination rate from the current 72 percent, Ruppert said. A 95 percent vaccination rate is considered necessary to prevent epidemics.
On Monday, county executives will meet with legal and health professionals to identify more possible new strategies to tackle the outbreak.
It comes after the county took the unprecedented measure on March 26 of banning unvaccinated minors from schools and public places for 30 days.
Several public health specialists saluted the county's decision.
But a dozen parents of public-school students sued the county, arguing that the measure was disproportionate to the danger, particularly as there have been no deaths to date.
On Friday they obtained a partial victory: a judge issued an injunction requiring county officials to drop the ban against any child with a ""religious exemption,"" at least until April 19.
""Religious exemption"": for many county residents, the words have become central to the debate over the resurgence of measles and the rise of the anti-vaccine movement.
- Religious exemptions - Like most American states -- all but three, including California -- New York requires a series of vaccinations for school-age children but grants exemptions on both medical and religious grounds.
In Rockland County, the local Jewish community represents about one-third of county inhabitants, including a large number of Orthodox Jews .
That fact places this community at the heart of the vaccination debate, raising the risk of fueling anti-Semitism, said Gary Siepser, president of the Jewish Foundation of Rockland County.
He emphasizes that there are anti-vaccine proponents both in the Jewish community and elsewhere who invoke religion to justify themselves -- but are motivated simply by their anti-vaccine convictions.
""You will not find rabbis citing Jewish law to say people should not be vaccinated,"" he said, stressing that his federation, like other Jewish organizations, encourages vaccination.
""It's shocking that these things that I didn't worry about with my kids because they could be vaccinated -- all of a sudden parents have to worry about their children getting life-threatening diseases,"" Siepser said.
""It's like the clock has been turned back -- it's crazy!"" - 'It's really scary out there' - Several Orthodox mothers questioned this week by AFP lashed out at the anti-vaccine parents. One of them was Cindy Scher, mother of four children aged seven to 17, all of whom have been vaccinated.
""It's really scary out there,"" she said.
""We all share the same roads, we share the same stores, we all have to interact with each other. We can't just be concerned about my religious beliefs, your religious beliefs,"" she said, as she walked out of a kosher supermarket in Monsey, the epicenter of the county's Orthodox community.
Against this background, some New York state lawmakers this week proposed a law to end vaccination exemptions.
""I think it's a great idea,"" said Ruppert, the health commissioner.
But the judge's decision on Friday in favor of the anti-vaccine forces complicates an already difficult debate.
""This is a country that has an interesting relationship with religion, the country was founded by people seeking some kind of religious liberties,"" Siepser said.
""The question becomes at what point one person's freedom ends and another person's rights begin."""

Khartoum, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Thousands of Sudanese demonstrators marched in Khartoum Saturday, many reaching the army headquarters for the first time since deadly protests against President Omar al-Bashir erupted in December , witnesses said.
Chanting ""one army , one people,"" the protesters rallied in the capital's streets following a call by organisers to march on the compound, which also houses Bashir's residence.
The crowds chanted the movement's catchcry ""peace, justice, freedom"" as they marched towards the complex where the defence ministry is also based, onlookers said.
""They were calling on Bashir to step down,"" a witness said.
Protester Amir Omer said the demonstrators had managed to send a message to the military.
""We still haven't achieved our goal, but we have delivered our message to the army and that is: come join us,"" he told AFP.
Fellow protester Adam Yagub, 40, said Bashir had ""ruined the country's economy so much that people are dying even due to shortage of medicines"".
Protest organisers led by the Sudanese Professionals Association said earlier this week that demonstrators would march Saturday to demand the army either ""take the side of the people or the dictator 's"".
- 'Historic moment' - Soon after reaching the army compound, organisers called on the protesters to stand firm outside its fortified walls.
""At this historic moment, we ask you to not leave the army headquarters and hold a sit-in in the nearby streets,"" the organisers said in a statement.
Since the protests erupted, security agents and riot police have cracked down on demonstrators but the army has not intervened.
After a few hours, dozens of vehicles full of riot police converged near the compound and fired tear gas at protesters in a bid to disperse them, witnesses said, adding that some demonstrators threw rocks at the police officers.
Late on Saturday crowds of protesters remained outside the complex, some singing and dancing.
In a separate demonstration Saturday, protesters reached the army office in the town of Madani southeast of the capital, witnesses told AFP by telephone.
""Today's turnout has been impressive,"" said a European diplomat on condition of anonymity.
""It puts further pressure on Bashir and the regime and shows that the protest movement is not dying out."" Late on Saturday protesters also rallied in Omdurman and in some areas of Khartoum , witnesses said.
Such protests have rocked the east African country since December , with angry crowds accusing Bashir's government of mismanaging the economy, leading to soaring food prices and regular shortages of fuel and foreign Currency .
The demonstrations first erupted on December 19 after a government decision to triple the price of bread.
But they quickly escalated into nationwide rallies against Bashir's rule.
On February 22, the veteran leader imposed a nationwide state of emergency to quell the protests after an initial crackdown failed to rein in the rallies.
Since emergency rule came into effect, the demonstrations have been largely confined to the capital and its twin city of Omdurman ."

Paris, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Brazilian football legend Pele, who has been in hospital in Paris , will discover on Sunday if he will be allowed to return to Brazil on Monday, his advisor told AFP.
""Tomorrow ( Sunday ), we will know. It is the doctors who will decide,"" said the advisor having earlier Saturday announced that Pele would definitely return Monday to Sao Paulo .
A date for the 78-year-old's discharge has not been officially announced by hospital which is based in the Paris suburbs.
The three-time World Cup winner was admitted to a hospital with a urinary tract infection on Wednesday, the day after appearing at a promotional event with France striker Kylian Mbappe.
Brazilian news website G1 reported that Pele had intended to come out of hospital on Saturday to return to Brazil but had been delayed by further tests and would stay under observation until he was 100 percent.
The infection was not serious and was under control, according to members of Pele's entourage.
""Thank you so much for all the love! The antibiotics are working,"" Pele tweeted on Friday. ""I'm feeling much better and I think I'm ready to play again!"" The event in Paris was originally scheduled for November but the Brazilian ""was not in a position to travel "".
Pele has had several health issues in recent years.
A similar infection put him in intensive care in November 2014.
In 2016 , Pele, who played 1,363 professional matches, scoring 1,281 goals, was unable to light the flame at the Rio Olympics because of severe pain in the hip.
""I was not physically fit to participate in the opening of the Games,"" he said at the time.
In January 2018 , he cancelled a trip to London fearing a ""stressful"" and ""tiring"" journey."

London, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :The name's Windsor . William Windsor .
As one of the most recognisable public figures in the world , Britain's Prince William would not make as effective a 007 as legendary fictional spy James bond .
But that did not stop the heir to the British throne spending the last three weeks working with the security services, including in Bond's own foreign intelligence unit MI6.
The Duke of Cambridge ended the top-secret attachment -- which also included a week with domestic intelligence service MI5 and cybersecurity agency GCHQ -- on Saturday, according to Kensington Palace.
""Spending time inside our security and intelligence agencies, understanding more about the vital contribution they make to our national security, was a truly humbling experience,"" William said in a statement.
""These agencies are full of people from everyday backgrounds doing the most extraordinary work to keep us safe."" The prince, who has a military background, began the secondment at the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) -- better known as MI6 -- whose spies work around the world gathering information and furthering British interests.
William, 36, ""got to see first-hand how SIS helps the UK identify and exploit opportunities as well as navigate risks to its national security, military effectiveness and economy,"" Kensington Palace said.
The father-of-three then switched over to the Security Service -- MI5 -- to observe how counter-terrorism teams conduct investigations, including surveillance.
The duke finished his foray into spycraft at the communications monitoring agency GCHQ in Cheltenham, in western England.
There he spent time ""with those using cutting-edge technology , technical ingenuity and wide-ranging partnerships to identify, analyse and disrupt threats,"" the palace added.
GCHQ's head of counter-terrorism operations, whose name was given only as David , said the prince had worked ""exceptionally hard to embed himself in the team"".
He added William had ""comfortably held his own amongst some highly skilled analysts and operators"".
The prince is no stranger to the world of security.
After graduating in 2005 from university in St Andrews in Scotland, he spent seven and a half years in the military, before completing active service as a search and rescue helicopter pilot."
UAE Press: Need to stop escalation in Libya,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/middle-east/uae-press-need-to-stop-escalation-in-libya-587942.html,"UAE Press: Need To Stop Escalation In Libya Fahad Shabbir (@FahadShabbir) 18 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 10:30 AM
ABU DHABI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 07th Apr, 2019) The escalation in Libya is a matter of serious concern and all sides involved in the conflict should realise that there can be no military solution to the ongoing crisis, but only a political one, a UAE newspaper has commented editorially.
""The Libyan people have suffered for too long and all that they are looking for is peace and development,"" said The Gulf Today in an editorial on Sunday , noting that prolonged political instability has added to their problems. It is hence necessary that warring parties exercise total restraint.
The governments of the UAE , France , Italy , UK , and the US have already expressed deep concern about the fighting around the Libyan city of Gharyan and rightly called on all parties to stop the escalation immediately.
The five powerful countries have made their stand clear: ""At this critical moment of transition in Libya , taking the military position and threats of unilateral action will only risk dragging Libya into chaos. We strongly believe that there is no military solution to the conflict in Libya .""
Dr. Anwar bin Mohammed Gargash, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, while heading the UAE ’s delegation to the Arab League Council last month, asserted the UAE ’s support for the efforts of the UN Special Envoy to Libya , Dr. Ghassan Salame, who sought to come to an agreement through a political solution which guaranteed the return of security and stability in Libya .
The UAE has been doing all it could to help the Arab efforts that aimed to support international efforts in Libya .
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ decision to hold talks with eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar in Benghazi on Friday in a bid to avert renewed civil war is a positive development.
Guterres has stated that helping to promote a Libyan-led and Libyan owned political solution to resolve years of instability and insecurity there that puts the welfare of the Libyan people first is the sole agenda of the United Nations within the country.
He has been trying to advance the UN ’s idea, first proposed more than a year ago and discussed in town halls across the country, of convening a Libyan National Conference on the nation’s political future, which could finally end years of turmoil following the removal from power of Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011.
Last month, Guterres expressed hope that a solution to Libya ’s instability, civil conflict, and economic turmoil could be found, following a historic meeting between Prime Minister Faiez Serraj, and Haftar, at the end of February .
The two leaders agreed to national, democratic elections, and ways to maintain stability in the country, and unify its institutions, according to a statement from the UN Mission UNSMIL.
""Terror groups should not be allowed to take advantage of the troubled situation prevailing in the country and turn Libya into a haven for their nefarious activities,"" added the editorial comment.
In September , Daesh claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on the headquarters of Libya ’s National Oil Company in Tripoli , which left two dead and 10 wounded.
While an estimated 8,000 migrants are currently held in detention centres, those detained make up a small fraction of the several hundred thousand migrants resident in Libya or passing through the country. Unfortunately, humanitarian workers have limited access to the centres and have been unable to do their best to help people in need.
""The only best way forward is a political solution to overcome the crisis. Libyans certainly deserve to live in a normal country with normal political institutions, with peace, security and prosperity. Continuing turbulence is just not acceptable,"" concluded the Sharjah-based daily. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Mal�, Maldives, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :The exiled former leader of the Maldives has led his party to a landslide victory only five months after returning to the country, preliminary results showed Sunday .
Ex-president Mohamed Nasheed, 51, was set for a dramatic return to the top of the national parliament , with his Maldivian Democratic Party headed for a two-thirds majority in the 87-member assembly .
Saturday's poll was the first test of public opinion since autocratic former president and Nasheed's arch-rival Abdulla Yameen was forced to stand down after his five-year term, facing charges of money laundering and embezzlement.
Nasheed returned to the country after his former deputy President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won an unexpected victory in September presidential elections for the MDP. Yameen had barred Nasheed from contesting.
Preliminary results from Saturday's election showed the MDP winning 50 out of the 87 seats, while private media reports projected the party eventually getting up to 68 seats.
""The Maldives is about to welcome a new dawn, a golden yellow dawn,"" Nasheed told his supporters in Male on Saturday. Yellow is the colour of his party.
Election officials estimated the final turnout to be between 70 and 80 percent, down from the 89 percent recorded at the September presidential election which unexpectedly toppled Yameen.
Nasheed, now set to take over the leadership of the legislature, has promised to turn the country into a parliamentary democracy by scrapping the executive presidential system adopted under political reforms in 2008.
President Solih said in a statement that the MDP had ""secured a huge majority in Majlis ( parliament )"".
""While we celebrate, we must also not forget the immense challenges that lie ahead of us,"" he said.
Solih campaigned for the MDP asking voters to return a parliament that could work with him to deliver on his election promises in September to investigate corruption under Yameen.
While Yameen was not a candidate, his Progressive Party of Maldives was seen as the main challenger to the MDP -- but ended up with a poor showing, and is projected to get only four seats.
Nasheed was jailed for 13 years on a controversial terrorism charge when Yameen was in power. However, the conviction was overturned last year after the presidency changed.
Election commissioner Ahmed Shareef told reporters there had been no complaints of irregularities in the runup to the vote , during balloting or at the count.
The Maldives was on the verge of being slapped with Western-led sanctions before Solih won the presidential election on a pledge to end corruption in the country best known for its luxury tourism."
Sanctions delay plans for N. Korean beach resort: analysts,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/sanctions-delay-plans-for-n-korean-beach-res-587940.html,"Sanctions Delay Plans For N. Korean Beach Resort: Analysts Sumaira FH 18 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 10:25 AM
Seoul, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) : North Korea has again pushed back the construction end-date of a massive beach resort -- a move analysts say shows the regime is struggling from international sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons programmes.
The eastern seaside strip, known as the Wonsan-Kalma Coastal Tourist Area, is intended as a centrepiece of the isolated country's nascent tourism industry as Pyongyang seeks to develop its economy despite the tough economic measures.
The site 's construction has been closely overseen by leader Kim Jong Un, and was initially scheduled to open this April , to mark the birthday anniversary of the country's founder Kim Il Sung.
But in a recent visit to the site , Kim delayed the finish date for the second time, ordering construction to be completed by the same time next year, the North's official Korean Central news Agency (KCNA) reported Saturday.
The decision, would allow the workers ""to perfectly finish it so that our people would fully enjoy themselves in the impeccable tourist area from the sea-bathing season next year"", KCNA quoted Kim as saying.
The plan was first pushed back last August when Kim extended the project by six months to October 2019 .
The isolated North is under several sets of sanctions for its weapons programmes which analysts say has hampered efforts to secure materials needed to finish the vast beach complex.
"" North Korea can complete the external construction of the hotels by itself but most of the finishing materials for the interior are imported,"" Cho Han-bum, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP.
The economic measures banned imports of some items and Pyongyang was supplying the sanctioned goods with its foreign Currency , Cho said, adding: ""But that has also dried up."" Satellite images taken by US monitors in December showed the buildings previously under construction were nearing completion.
""The North Korean economy has hit a limit with the sanctions,"" Cho added.
Immediate sanctions relief was a key demand of the cash-strapped North when Kim met with US President Donald Trump in Hanoi in February for a second summit that ultimately broke down.
Trump, the former real estate developer turned billionaire, has praised North Korea 's tourism potential, referring to its ""great beaches"" he said would make ideal locations for condos. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Jerusalem, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Saturday to annex settlements in the occupied West Bank if he wins the upcoming general election .
His comments come just days before the closely-fought April 9 poll and could be seen as an appeal to rightwing voters, who do not believe in the feasibility of a peace agreement with the Palestinians.
""I will apply (Israeli) sovereignty, but I don't distinguish between settlement blocs and isolated settlements,"" he said in an interview to Channel 12 television .
Settlements built on land occupied by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War are deemed illegal by the international community and their ongoing construction is seen as a major barrier to peace.
Annexation could prove to be the death knell for the two-state solution.
In an interview broadcast Friday, Netanyahu said he told US President Donald Trump he would not remove settlements or people as part of a future American peace plan.
""I said there shouldn't be the removal of even one settlement"" from the occupied West Bank , Netanyahu told Israel 's Channel 13 television ."
Farmers and nomads take to violence in drought-stricken Chad,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/farmers-and-nomads-take-to-violence-in-drough-587938.html,"Farmers And Nomads Take To Violence In Drought-stricken Chad Umer Jamshaid 18 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 10:25 AM
Abeche, Chad, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :The chief medical officer at Adre hospital takes a routine phone call: a patient has been admitted with gunshot wounds and needs emergency surgery.
A dusty town in eastern Chad , once part of the proud Ouaddai empire, Adre is caught up in a mounting conflict between local farmers and nomadic camel herders from the north of the sprawling country.
Last year, the hospital treated more than 100 patients with bullet wounds.
In a territory where almost everyone seems to have a gun -- a legacy of rebellions launched from eastern Chad and of the brutal conflict in Sudan 's Darfur -- squabbles over grazing land and trampled crops swiftly lead to violence.
Such disputes are tragically familiar in many parts of Africa .
But in arid eastern Chad , near the border with Sudan , the bloodshed is particularly acute, rooted in a bitter drought and population pressure sharpening rivalry over access to land.
The vicious circle of attack and retribution is running full tilt.
- Seasonal - Admissions in Adre rise sharply during ""times of tension"", a source at the local hospital said.
Those times mirror the seasons. At the end of the rainy season, in December and January , herders drive their beasts northwards into the Sahel. When water sources start running low, they return south, from about the end of June .
Local chief Abderahim Dahab, who supervises 136 villages in his traditional leadership role, said the modern-day bloodshed contrasted with long-established cohabitation.
""Movement of livestock has always happened peacefully, for decades,"" he said.
Migratory herders benefit from pasture on which to feed their animals, and farmers benefit from the animals, whose droppings fertilise the soil. And farmers and herders mutually benefit from trading with each other for food .
Historian Mahamat Saleh Yacoub said two factors explained the breakdown between the two communities.
The first is a drought that has gripped the Sahel since the 1970s and seems to be worsening. Everyone who spoke to AFP agreed that the key issue is a lack of water .
""The herders are now coming earlier in the year and going back later. The established ways have broken down,"" said another district chief.
Saleh Yacoub, who is head of the ENS college of higher education in Abeche , near Adre, said the second cause was a population increase -- ""as much among people as among livestock"".
Herds are getting larger, straining the fragile ecological resources of the Ouaddai.
- Ethnic friction - The rivalry has ""become intertwined with ethnic problems"", added Yacoub.
""The herds all belong to the same people: colonels, generals, people in politics ,"" explained a village elder sitting on his mat with a glass of tea.
""We have had meetings, we write letters to the deputy prefect (district administrator), the prefect himself, but get nothing back,"" he protested. ""The population has no power against them."" Many cattlemen are members of the Zaghawa ethnic group, who come from the northeast of the giant country.
The Zaghawa include President Idriss Deby Itno, who came to power in 1990.
Members of their ethnicity have entered every rank of the Chadian state, although Ouaddai's governor , Ramadan Erdebou, dismisses any suggestion that tribalism is to blame for the region's problems.
""This ethnic question is a false debate. There are Chadian women and Chadian men and one single unity , Chad ,"" said Erdebou, who was formerly the chief of the regime's powerful intelligence services.
- Disarmament - Erdebou's predecessor was sacked after an explosion of communal violence last October claimed eight lives.
One of his first moves in office was to announce a massive disarmament campaign among the population.
He also warned that a mission would be coming from the capital N'Djamena to chase away ""those farmers who have cultivated crops along the corridors (set aside) for livestock movement."" These designated corridors were established by law in 1959, to give nomads and their herds passage of up to one kilometre (more than half a mile) wide for their seasonal migrations.
""But Zaghawa herders feel they can do what they like and don't respect them,"" said a farmer, who maintains he lost his entire peanut crop in 2016 when hundreds of dromedaries trampled his field.
""How do you expect Ouaddians to agree to be disarmed when you see that the herdsmen have more and more weapons?"" asked a local official.
In 2015 , the National Assembly in the distant western capital passed a Pastoral Code that led to an outcry from people who found it heavily biased in favour of the cattle breeders. Deby overturned the law.
""It's hard to want national unity when those in power only favour their own,"" said the local official, who asked not to be named, saying he feared reprisals.
But, Saleh Yacoub observed, when quarrels turn violent, ""the Zaghawa become the target for all the grievances, regardless of whether they are legitimate or not."" In a visit to Abeche in February , Deby named no Names but acknowledged there was a ""serious problem.""He vowed to ""take matters in hand"".
""The hour for vendettas is past,"" he declared. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"
Cuba newsprint shortage sounds alarm for economy,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/cuba-newsprint-shortage-sounds-alarm-for-econ-587937.html,"Cuba Newsprint Shortage Sounds Alarm For Economy Faizan Hashmi 18 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 10:25 AM
Havana, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :The newsprint shortages which forced Cuba 's Communist daily to run a trimmed-down edition on Friday would pass off as a simple supply glitch in most other countries, but in Havana they carry chilling memories of the not-so-distant past.
The last time the government cut back on newspapers because of a lack of newsprint was in the early 1990s, when Fidel Castro ushered in a ""Special Period"" of drastic belt-tightening in the wake of the collapse of his main sponsor, the Soviet Union.
Today, the Caribbean state is facing difficulties once again, with US President Donald Trump -- who has lashed out at Cuba for its support of Venezuela 's socialist regime -- determined to tighten Washington 's six-decade trade embargo.
Meager growth of 1.2 percent is not enough to cover the needs of an island nation that imports 80 percent of what it eats.
Amid shortages, the government is being forced to ration basics like flour, cooking oil and chicken, leading to long lines outside stores.
Tania, a 49-year-old nurse, has come to buy rice at a Havana grocery store but she's going away empty-handed.
""It's like that with everything. Sometimes you look for a product and you can find it in one place, then you go somewhere else and you can't get it,"" she said, summing up the average Cuban's daily struggle to fill their shopping basket.
""What's happening now doesn't look like the Special Period, because at that time it was really a disaster,"" she said.
- 'Special Period' - Suddenly deprived of its big brother in Moscow -- responsible for 85 percent of Havana 's foreign trade -- the economy on the Caribbean archipelago ground to a standstill as it struggled to absorb the shock of Soviet collapse in the early 1990s.
Cubans suffered shortages of food and fuel and the emergence of diseases linked to malnutrition. Thousands fled, if they could.
For long since, the country has relied on medical and teaching services supplied to countries like Brazil and, in particular, Venezuela , in return for cheap oil imports. But trade with Caracas has plummeted as sanctions-struck Venezuela 's economic crisis deepens.
Tourism has been a bright spot but that has suffered after hurricane damage and a new US sanctions squeeze.
""For three years, Cuba has been trying to offset the impact of the slump in trade with Venezuela and the rise in tourism, private activity and foreign investment projects have helped cushion the economic shock,"" said Pavel Vidal, a Cuban economist at the Javeriana University in Colombia .
""But the measures and threats of the Trump administration are posing obstacles to these three factors that have helped keep the economy afloat."" Cuba recently defaulted on a portion of its debt to Brazil , a big supplier of poultry.
At the end of 2018 , Havana had accumulated short-term debt of $1.5 billion , according to former economy minister Jose Luis Rodriguez.
""There is a level of debt that we will not be able to pay (in 2019 ) and that's affecting the smooth running of the economy,"" the current portfolio-holder Alejandro Gil said.
In Havana , 90-year-old Leandro Lopez has seen it all before and isn't overly concerned, expressing confidence in President Miguel Diaz-Canel -- elected in 2018 , the first of a new breed of leaders born after the revolution.
""Diaz-Canel is trying to strengthen the economy so where he can reduce costs, we reduce them, so much the better. I do not think it will hurt the news ."" - Paper cuts - The cuts, announced on Thursday, saw Friday's edition of the mouthpiece Granma daily slashed from 16 pages to a pamphlet-thin eight.
The measure will mean drastically shortened editions twice a week and also affect other publications.
""Yes, there are shortages, long lines, especially for chicken, soap, these kinds of things,"" said Nelson Flores , turning away from a long line of shoppers waiting to buy poultry.
So far, the crisis has spared the sacrosanct ""libreta"" -- the ration book which entitles Cubans to buy basics like rice, beans and bread at subsidized prices , though in insufficient quantities to last a month.
Worryingly, the tourist industry is beginning to feel the pinch. A hotel manager in one of the outlying island beach paradises told AFP that tourists on all-inclusive holiday packages were unhappy about a lack of eggs, fruit and bread. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Rennes, France, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :After Britain leaves the European Union some 900 Britons serving on local councils in France will also have to give up their seat at the table.
Like all EU citizens living in another member country, Britons in France have the right to vote in local elections and stand for election to their local council.
But in leaving the bloc Britain will forfeit that right, meaning that British residents will no longer be able to represent the communities some have served for years.
Sandra Sheward and her husband moved to the western French region of Brittany 13 years ago.
""Our children fled the nest and we decided to drop out of the rat race in London ,"" said Sheward, 58, a former training specialist for a property services company .
The pair restored a farmhouse on the edge of Saint-Caradec, a riverside village of 1,200 people, where Sheward was courted by the mayor to join his slate of candidates for the municipal council in 2014.
Being the only non-French councillor, and one who has yet to fully master the language, has not been an obstacle, says Sheward, a born organiser who developed the village's Christmas art market and helped set up a yoga class, among other activities.
""She doesn't speak much during council meetings but when she does it's always very constructive,"" Mayor Alain Guillaume said.
In a region that draws large numbers of British tourists and where a number of Britons have second homes, it's also helpful to have a native English speaker to call on for translations and other assistance.
But if Britain leaves the EU as expected, Sheward will be forced to bow out of politics at the next local elections in 2020 .
""French villages are like ghost towns so it has been nice to be on the council. You get to meet more people!"" said Sheward, who has applied for residency in France .
""I'd like to be re-elected but it depends on Brexit ,"" she said, adding with a sigh: ""I just wish they'd get on with it so that we too can get on with our lives."""
Hungarian Roma designer fights stereotypes with fashion,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/hungarian-roma-designer-fights-stereotypes-wi-587935.html,"Hungarian Roma Designer Fights Stereotypes With Fashion Fahad Shabbir (@FahadShabbir) 18 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 10:25 AM
Budapest, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Hungarian Roma fashion designer Erika Varga says her label is about stitching together cultural traditions and snipping through stereotypes as much as it's about dressmaking.
""Fashion is a branch of art that interests and connects people, non-Roma and Roma ,"" the founder of Romani Design said.
Often blamed for petty crime, the Roma , Hungary 's largest ethnic minority , face widespread discrimination, poverty and exclusion from mainstream society.
""In most cases, Roma appear in a pejorative way in the media .
""Many turn away from their own culture... But people need positive role models, not just the majority in society but also Roma people themselves,"" the 47-year-old designer said.
Founded in 2010 by Varga to promote Roma fashion and identity, her Romani Design studio brought out its first collection the same year.
Now, her evening dresses can sell for up to 1,000 Euros ($1,100).
""As a Roma-run social enterprise , it's unique in the world ,"" Varga told AFP, ahead of International Roma Day on Monday.
""We don't make mass-produced T-shirts but clothes that carry messages, like on minority rights and integration,"" she added.
- 'Rebel Spirit' - Varga's latest range, called Rebel Spirit, is inspired by strong female figures, including her mother, late grandmother and 20th century Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, a hero of hers.
The small, long-haired designer said she asked ""nonconforming women who have overcome challenges in their lives"" to model the range.
""It's important to express openness in what you wear,"" said one of the models, Adel Onodi, 23, who became the first transgender woman to appear on the front cover of a Hungarian fashion magazine last year.
After leaving school in eastern Hungary , Varga soon set up her own jewellery-making business before branching out into fashion design.
Now, she employs five staff, including her folk-singer sister, who design and make the frocks at Varga's home studio on the outskirts of Budapest where she lives with her husband and two dogs.
Varga says that she is not put off running a business by conventional attitudes in the Roma community on women 's role in society.
""My own mother all her life was involved in trading clothes, so for me it's completely normal to be both Roma and a businesswoman,"" she said.
Traditional Roma motifs like flowers are a typical feature of her designs, particularly one of her favourites, the rose -- a symbol of femininity -- which adorns even the slippers she wears while pedalling her sewing machine.
Most of her skirts and dresses are long, in line with Roma tradition.
Daring combinations of bright colours -- ""brought by the Roma over the centuries from India and Asia ,"" she says -- also characterise her outfits.
Rozina Patkai, a Hungarian singer who wears Varga's clothes during her performances, says they often attract compliments.
""The main thing is that I feel confident in these clothes,"" she tells AFP."

Kigali, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) : Rwanda on Sunday begins one hundred days of mourning for over 800,000 people slaughtered in a genocide that shocked the world , a quarter of a century on from the day it began.
President Paul Kagame will start a week of commemoration activities by lighting a remembrance flame at the Kigali Genocide Memorial, where more than 250,000 victims are believed to be buried, mainly from the Tutsi people.
They are only some of those killed by the genocidal Hutu forces, members of the old army and militia forces called the ""Interahamwe"", that began their bloody campaign of death on April 7, 1994, the day after the assassination of President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu.
Some were shot; most were beaten or hacked by machetes.
The killings lasted until Kagame, then 36, led the mainly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) into Kigali on July 4, ending the slaughter and taking control of the devastated country.
Kagame, now 61 and who has been in power ever since, will lead the memorial to the dead .
After lighting the flame, Kagame is expected to make a key speech at the Kigali Convention Centre, a dome-shaped auditorium in the centre of the capital, a modern building emblematic of the regeneration of Rwanda since the dark days of 1994.
Kagame will then preside over a vigil at the country's main football ground. The Amahoro National Stadium -- whose name means ""peace"" in Rwanda 's Kinyarwanda language -- was used by the UN during the genocide to protect thousands of people of the Tutsi minority from being massacred on the streets outside."

""To start a movement where we're going to start getting followed, I think that's a big moment."" Kupcho, the reigning US college champion, won the historic first title for women at once all-male Augusta National, which didn't have women members from its 1933 founding until 2012.
Crowds enjoyed a final-pair duel for the title that went down to the last of 54 holes, the first two rounds having been played at nearby Champions Retreat before the closer at Augusta .
""It probably won't set in for a little while,"" Kupcho said. ""There were just so many people. Just to get to walk the fairways and walk up 18 with all of those fans, it was an experience unlike any other."" Two shots down with six holes to play, Kupcho hit an impressive approach at the par-5 13th hole to six feet and sank a tense eagle putt to equalize, then birdied the par-5 15th, par-3 16th and par-4 18th to seal the milestone victory.
""To do it on this big a stage is probably one of the biggest things I've ever been able to do,"" she said. ""It was quite a day. It's an amazing feeling.""She and Fassi will now have greater attention when they make their LPGA debuts.
""I know we're going to have a great time out there next year in the LPGA,"" Kupcho said. ""That's something everyone is going to look forward to watching."""
"Elections over, Turkey's Erdogan eyes economic reforms",www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/elections-over-turkeys-erdogan-eyes-economi-587924.html,"Elections Over, Turkey's Erdogan Eyes Economic Reforms Umer Jamshaid 19 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 09:45 AM
Istanbul, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Soon after his ruling party faced defeat in Ankara and Istanbul in last Sunday 's election , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was quick to promise reforms to revive the country's weakened economy.
Stung by high living costs and a 2018 Currency crisis, voters handed the AKP one of the party's worst setbacks after a decade and a half in power.
Now with no elections until 2023, Erdogan has room to focus on the economy, but analysts say he must convince investors already wary over his sometimes unorthodox policies, and worried about fallout from tensions with the United States .
Turkey's lira can be volatile, but analysts said Erdogan 's government must balance any gains from short-term stopgaps with the need for deeper reforms for more long-term stability.
Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, also Erdogan 's son-in-law, has said Turkey will enter ""an economic rebalancing period"" after the elections and he is set to reveal reform details next week.
Albayrak is due to meet IMF and World Bank officials in Washington April 12-14 to ""shed light on the new road map"" for Turkey 's economy, according to the Daily Sabah newspaper.
""As concerns about the struggling economy motivated many voters' decisions at the ballot box, Erdogan will be compelled to address its underlying problems,"" said Amanda Sloat at the Brookings Institute. ""However, he has limited room for manoeuvre."" The AKP built its success on Turkey 's strong growth and his supporters point to progress in living standards during Erdogan 's 16 years in office.
But on Sunday , the AKP was punished in part because Turkish households were stung last year by a 30 percent slide in the lira during a diplomatic crisis with the US.
Once the darling of emerging market investors, economists say Turkey has lost some of its appeal as problems emerged with growth driven by foreign credit.
Turkey has slipped into recession for the first time in a decade, inflation is in double digits and economists are watching how Turkish officials will manage its recovery.
""On paper and in public speeches, the economic leadership... seems to agree reform is needed. In practice, the government 's recent record is poor ,"" said Maya Senussi, senior economist at Oxford Economics.
""The authorities have to not only admit that mistakes were made over the past year, but also signal a readiness to sacrifice growth in the short term to increase the chances of long term prosperity -- a decision the AKP has so far been unwilling to make.""

"Under Donald Trump, Fed faces politicization",www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/under-donald-trump-fed-faces-politicization-587922.html,"Under Donald Trump, Fed Faces Politicization Muhammad Irfan 20 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 09:20 AM
Washington, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :The US Federal Reserve has regularly faced criticism from Donald Trump , but in recent days the president took matters into his own hands -- raising concerns that the Fed is being politicized.
Not only did he again urge the Fed to lower interest rates, but he tapped two unconventional loyalists to fill two empty seats on the Fed board.
Stephen Moore, 59, is a controversial economist and former Trump campaign adviser.
And Herman Cain, 73, previously served as a board member at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank and is the former CEO of a pizza restaurant chain.
Cain, a candidate for the Republican Party's nomination in the 2012 presidential election , suspended his campaign following allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denied.
With the 2020 election looming, Trump often praises the health of the US economy -- but on Friday he said that he wants it to take off like ""a rocket ship."" To make that happen, he urged the Fed to restart its post-financial crisis ""quantitative easing"" program of buying bonds to add liquidity to the economy.
Trump's moves have alarmed some experts, but he is not alone in thinking the Fed went too far last year: some economists such as Joseph LaVorgna from Natixis think it tightened too much.
For Michael Gapen of Barclays Research, the president's choices ""could raise questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve and could be perceived as an attempted politicization of monetary policy."" Tim Duy, economics professor at the University of Oregon and an expert on the central bank , told AFP that he believes ""the threats to the Fed independence are at the highest in decades."" Such pressure from the White House has not been seen since the 1970s. On the eve of his 1972 reelection, former president Richard Nixon pressed then Fed chair Arthur Burns to lower interest rates.
"" Donald Trump is very mad at (Fed chair) Jerome Powell and his colleagues for continuing to raise the interests rates (in 2018 ) and realizes he has a role to play here. He can appoint whoever he wants to the Fed,"" added Duy.
At the beginning of his term, Trump had more traditional choices such as Richard Clarida or Randal Quarles, both US Treasury Department economists.
Trump's chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Friday defended his boss's approach.
""It's a free country and the president has a lot of well-informed opinions as a successful businessman and investor,"" he said.
""We are not pressuring. We are not going after their independence but we have our point of view."""
Smith backs fellow ball-tamperer Bancroft as Durham captain,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/sports/smith-backs-fellow-ball-tamperer-bancroft-as-587921.html,"Smith Backs Fellow Ball-tamperer Bancroft As Durham Captain Muhammad Rameez 20 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 09:20 AM
Sydney, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Shamed former Australia captain Steve Smith has backed fellow ball-tamperer Cameron Bancroft as an astute choice to skipper English county side Durham after his appointment raised eyebrows.
Smith, Bancroft and David Warner were all banned over the scandal involving sandpaper to alter the ball in South Africa last year, but are now back playing.
While Warner was also barred from ever holding a leadership role again and Smith prevented from doing so for 12 months after his one-year suspension expired, Bancroft was free to assume a captaincy.
Durham appointed him last month, insisting he was ""the best available option"" despite criticism from some quarters, including former English bowler Darren Gough who slammed it as ""disgraceful"".
But Smith said Bancroft had shown ""great character"" in the way he handled his ban and return to cricket .
""Cam is a good choice for captain,"" Smith told ESPNcricinfo. ""He's got a good head on his shoulders and has shown great character in the way he has come back after his time out.
""It has been a tough time for him no doubt, but he's a good guy who will do his best for Durham and will lead them well.
""He gets the game pretty well and has a good understanding of strategy and players,"" he added.
""He's found a bit of form with the bat and will be able to use his experience in a positive way."" Bancroft's selection was controversial not just due to the cheating scandal but also because he is missing Durham 's Championship opener to attend Western Australia 's end-of-season awards dinner and could also be selected for Australia 's Ashes series in England.
Durham chief executive Tim Bostock has defended his appointment.
""I think he'll be a breath of fresh air, he'll bring a different perspective to leadership,"" he said last month.
Bancroft is one of around 10 Australian players set to appear for English county sides this season, including Joe Burns, Shaun Marsh and Glenn Maxwell."

Brussels, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Will Russian trolls, American social media giants and opportunistic fake news merchants combine to poison Europe 's political landscape ahead of May 's continent-wide election? Brussels fears that online disinformation will fuel the populist wave officials believe skewed the Brexit referendum and carried Donald Trump all the way to the White House .
""There are external anti-European forces, which are seeking -- openly or secretly -- to influence the democratic choices of Europeans,"" EU leader Donald Tusk warned recently.
This was, he claimed, also ""the case with Brexit and a number of election campaigns across Europe ."" Between May 23 and 26, European voters will go to the polls to choose around 700 MEPs to sit in the Strasbourg EU parliament and oversee continent-wide legislation.
In the final weeks of the campaign, officials are on alert fearing that opponents -- including Moscow -- will attempt to spread fake news, amplified by viral social media .
This could in turn boost support for various populist insurgent parties, deepen existing divisions in the electorate and undermine faith in democracy or EU institutions.
Some go as far as to call the phenomenon a state-led attack .
""There is strong evidence pointing to Russia as a Primary source of disinformation in Europe ,"" said EU Commission vice-president and former Estonian premier Andrus Ansip.
""Disinformation is part of Russia 's military doctrine and its strategy to divide and weaken the West,"" he warned, in December .
Public trust in national and EU institutions and in the so-called mainstream media is already low, and web-users seeking cash from advertising clicks have found a market for fake news.
Add to this state-led covert propaganda and the viral effect of US-based media platforms like Facebook , Twitter and Google 's YouTube and you have a recipe for disruption.

Khartoum, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :One Sudanese protester died as thousands of demonstrators marched in Khartoum Saturday, many reaching the army headquarters for the first time since the deadly protests against President Omar al-Bashir erupted in December .
Chanting ""one army , one people,"" the protesters rallied in the capital's streets following a call by organisers to march on the compound, which also houses Bashir's residence and the defence ministry.
Organisers said earlier this week that demonstrators would gather to demand the army either ""take the side of the people or the dictator 's"".
The crowds chanted the movement's catchcry ""peace, justice, freedom"", onlookers said.
""We still haven't achieved our goal, but we have delivered our message to the army and that is: come join us,"" protester Amir Omer told AFP.
""They were calling on Bashir to step down,"" another witness added.
Fellow protester Adam Yagub, 40, said Bashir had ""ruined the country's economy so much that people are dying even due to shortage of medicines"".
Police said a protester had died in the capital's twin city of Omdurman .
""There were illegal gatherings in Khartoum and other states,"" police spokesman General Hashim Abdelrahim told the official SUNA news agency.
"" Police have recorded the death of one person during disturbances in Omdurman ."" A committee of doctors that helped organise the protests confirmed that the ""martyr"" was a medic.
It means the death toll in protest-related violence since December has now risen to 32, according to officials.

UN chief reaffirms commitment to untying 'Gordian knot' of Mideast conflict,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/un-chief-reaffirms-commitment-to-untying-gor-587916.html,"UN Chief Reaffirms Commitment To Untying 'Gordian Knot' Of Mideast Conflict Fahad Shabbir (@FahadShabbir) 20 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 09:15 AM
UNITED NATIONS, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) : UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has reaffirmed the world body's deep engagement in a surge of diplomacy for peace in the middle East to ""untie the Gordian knot of conflict and instability."" The UN chief's comments were made on Saturday, during the World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting on the Middle East and North Africa , held by the Dead Sea in Jordan.
As an example of the regional conflicts that, he said, must be resolved, Guterres cited the implementation of a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine , ""living side by side in peace with secure and recognized borders, and with Jerusalem as capital of the two countries."" The Secretary-General, who has been visiting several Middle Eastern states, said that he was able to report positive progress in certain cases, such as the first free municipal elections in Tunisia , where ""the democratic transition continues to advance""; his talks with the Grand Imam of Al-Alzhar Mosque in Egypt , with whom he discussed ways to advance tolerance and mutual respect; and the development of UN plans to combat hate speech, and safeguard religious sites worldwide.
Thanking King Abdullah and Queen Rania for hosting the meeting and championing peace, Guterres described Jordan as a ""fundamental pillar of regional stability,"" and a country with large private-sector opportunities.
With its large youth population, said the UN chief, Jordan � a ""driving force"" behind a landmark Security Council resolution highlighting the importance of including the voices of young people � is poised to ""reap a demographic dividend."" The Middle East and North Africa , he added, should not only be looked at as an area of conflict, but also a region of opportunities which, given the right internal approaches, and support from the international community, could unleash ""remarkable dynamism and capacity."" Guterres noted that several countries in the region have integrated political demands made by their citizens, such as social protection, good governance and human rights; efforts have been made to tackle violent extremism; and steps against gender-based discrimination, including domestic violence legislation and penalties for sexual harassment, have been implemented.
On this score, Guterres emphasized the economic importance of empowering women : it has been shown that full and real gender parity would have a major impact on the region, increasing the gross domestic product by some $2. 7 trillion by 2025.
Following his appearance at the WEF meeting, the UN chief travelled to the Baqa'a camp, one of six ""emergency"" camps set up in 1968 to accommodate Palestine refugees and displaced people who left the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a result of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
Today, Baqa'a is home to nearly 120,000 registered Palestinian refugees , and is the largest camp north of the Jordanian capital, Amman .
There, he met with staff and beneficiaries of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), and emphasized the importance of continuing to fund the vital services UNRWA provides to millions of Palestine refugees in the West Bank , including East Jerusalem , Gaza , Jordan, Lebanon and Syria .
""The stories I heard today were very compelling, both in showing the strength and courage of Palestinian refugees , and in conveying their concern about their future,"" the Secretary-General said.
""What remains with me are words of hope and determination of men and women , young and old."" Guterres also visited one of the UNRWA-run schools in the camp and, in remarks to the press made following the visit , he insisted that such schools must not close: ""in 700 schools, 530,000 Palestine refugee children are learning about human rights, about democracy , about tolerance, making the conditions to be exemplary citizens. And this is something that warms my heart."" These, and other UNRWA programmes, he said, represent a very important contribution to the well-being of the Palestine refugee population, to seeing their human rights respected and dignity upheld, and are an important factor of stability.
The UN chief noted the extremely difficult financial problems that UNRWA has faced, and the devastating impact that the closure of UNRWA health and education programmes would have in a country like Jordan.
He appealed to the international community to maintain the level of financing for UNRWA in 2019 , and make sure that stability is guaranteed for the following year. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Dear Amy,
I think my girlfriend is in touch with her ex quite a bit, via text, phone and social media.
She does not want me to have an Instagram account, so I deleted the one I had. She blocked me on Twitter, then said she would unblock me, but never did. She is very secretive and protective of her phone and makes sure to hide it from me if I come into the room.
She recently attended an event that her ex was at. When I asked her in advance if he was going to be there, she said no.
When she returned, I asked her about the event, and she got very angry and defensive. When she talks to him, she sometimes tells me about it but most often gets defensive and somewhat hostile. She claims I am just trying to catch her doing something wrong. I know she is talking to him with somewhat regular frequency, but I do not want to bring it up. She is going to another event in about a month and will be seeing him again there.
I completely understand if she is happy being with her ex or if they are rekindling that old flame. I just don't want to be a safety net while they light that fire again.
Any input and/or advice would be greatly appreciated.
— Whipping Boi
""She does not want me to have an Instagram account, so I deleted the one I had."" Wh t?
Your girlfriend does not get to control your social media presence. Healthy couples maintain their own public identity, and don't need permission from their partner to do so. This is classic abusive and isolating behavior. However, in your case, you seem to realize that your girlfriend is doing this, and you are helping her.
There are a number of red flags here. Your girlfriend seems to be in close touch with her ex. But even if she weren't, her dictates would still be unacceptable. I think it's time to part.
Wife wants housemates
Dear Amy,
My wife and I have been married for a little over a year now.
Unfortunately, I've been living overseas for the last few months. During this time, we've really been thinking about our future together, since I'm close to being back home for good.
We've come to what seems to me a huge block in our road. She wants to get a place with her close friends (they're married with three kids), whereas I prefer us to have our own home. Together. And start our own family.
This is really important to me because I want to enjoy being married and being with her, and it seems this is something we can't agree on.
What should I do?
— Expatriate
I agree with you that you and your wife should live together in order to start your life as a married couple with privacy and intimacy.
However, you haven't been around during much of your marriage. During your absence, I'm assuming that your wife has done what smart people do — she has found a tribe. She has found a surrogate family.
My instinct is that she is a little afraid. She knows that the presence of this other family and this crowded household will provide a buffer for her.
You have to communicate about this. When you talk to her, ask her to outline her reasoning, and listen carefully to what she tells you.
A reasonable compromise might be for the two of you to rent a furnished apartment for three months or so while you sort out the particulars of your marriage, as well as your living situation.
Dealing with noisy people
Dear Amy,
""Coffee Shop Patron"" was sitting next to some loud girls.
I was glad you pointed out that interjecting is typically a useless act and can also create blowback. It's best to move out of earshot or leave.
Personally, I have a naturally loud voice and can be quite animated when I am at restaurants, so I occasionally get a person complaining to me directly.
I feel I am more distracting than disruptive.
The last time, a fellow complained to me that he and his table couldn't have a conversation because I was so animated. I just looked at him and said, ""Wow. That's the first time I've been blamed for someone else being boring!""
He should have taken a page from your book.
— Animated
I guess you can add rudeness to your list of attributes.

Carolyn Hax: Gay grandson treads gently with grandma,www.providencejournal.com,Carolyn Hax Washington Post Writers Group,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20190407/carolyn-hax-gay-grandson-treads-gently-with-grandma,"Carolyn Hax: Gay grandson treads gently with grandma By Carolyn HaxWashington Post Writers Group Sunday Apr 7, 2019 at 12:01 AM But his boyfriend disagrees with the approach and thinks he needs to 'tell off' the grandmother.
Dear Carolyn,
I am gay, and my grandma has always been totally supportive of me, even though she grew up in a conservative time and place and I was the first openly gay person she'd ever met. She sometimes asks me questions that sound clueless, but in a sweet way — the same way she's clueless about the video games I play but still shows interest because she knows it's something I enjoy.
My boyfriend just met my grandma. They talked awhile outside my presence, then afterward he started railing about how ""ignorant"" she is. Apparently she asked him questions he found offensive.
I'm sure my grandma meant no harm, and blaming her is like blaming a person learning a foreign language for saying an offensive word without knowing it was offensive.
My boyfriend thinks I need to ""tell off"" my grandma and I'm not comfortable with that. How should I navigate this?
— Grandson
Yeah! The world needs more people pushing to tell off grandmas.
This wants to be a question about homosexuality and conservatism and family, but it's not. It's a question about respect between two people in a relationship, and about maturity.
You have clearly devoted much thought to the grandma question, and come to a conscientious conclusion that she loves you, means no harm and is as open as you can reasonably expect her to be. I'm not saying it's the right conclusion (though I suspect it is) — just one you took pains to draw.
When your boyfriend ""railed"" at you to ""tell off"" your grandma, the real target wasn't grandma herself. The target was your carefully-considered decision to accept her as she is. Your boyfriend was trashing your judgment.
And he did so with an emotional outburst that wrongheadedly promoted emotional outbursts as an appropriate form of communication. That's the maturity piece. He seems to have little or none of it, a deal-breaking problem unto itself.
But back to the more interesting part: He has every right to challenge — civilly, please — your approach to a family member who welcomes a gay person as she would an extraterrestrial. I won't say whether your boyfriend was right or wrong, either, to call bull on her ""ignorant"" questions. More importantly, it's the way you disagree that matters here, not who's correct.
To that end, you have every right to stand by your decision to embrace Grandma as-is; to challenge your boyfriend's default to confrontation when people don't behave as he'd like them to; and to (ahem) make it a prerequisite for any intimate relationship with anyone that you agree that a ""tell off"" culture is juvenile — even if, especially if, you embrace diversity of opinion on just about anything else.
Do take this opportunity to view your grandmother and your approach to her through your boyfriend's eyes. Do it just because it's a good exercise in general to separate a person's message from their method of delivery, since valid complaints can be expressed via tantrum — just as calm, measured people can have utterly misplaced concerns.
Then, square up your opinion on the subject, present it to your boyfriend calmly, and own it. How he responds to that — to you, to your judgment and self-possession — and how you respond to him will tell you what you need to know.
Friends are incompatible travelers
Dear Carolyn,
I learned on a recent trip that my friend and I aren't compatible for travel. I had to talk her out of parking at a drugstore and taking the bus to the beach just to save a few bucks on parking. She also spent endless amounts of time asking for recommendations and reading reviews online before going anywhere. Everything had to be the best, but she didn't want to spend any money on it (she has plenty). I had to tell her several times that we were wasting time and that we should just choose something and enjoy it.
Anyway, I will not be traveling with her again, but how do I tell her this? And how do I handle it when she gets upset about not being invited on my upcoming solo trip? I guess I feel guilty because she doesn't have many friends or much in the way of family, but the trip with her felt like a waste of time and money.
— Incompatible
When prompted, just tell the truth — kindly, and only in the quantity you need — then take the pain.
""We have very different travel styles, [friend's name]. I'm saying no because you're my friend. We're better local.""
If she gets upset, then say you didn't mean to upset her and hope that this won't come between you.
The ""doesn't have many friends"" thing sounds like the effect of her inclination to get upset — and the anxiety-type behaviors you describe from your trip — not the cause of it. If true, then the advice is the same, conveniently: Remain the best friend to her that you can be while remaining true to yourself.

AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a note issued to investors on Friday, Zacks.com reports.
According to Zacks, “AbbVie’s key drug, Humira is performing well in the United States based on strong demand trends. Moreover, Imbruvica has multibillion dollar potential. Mavyret saw a stronger-than-expected launch and has become a significant contributor to sales. AbbVie expects several products with multibillion-dollar potential to be launched in the near term. However, AbbVie’s shares have underperformed the industry this year. Sales erosion due to direct biosimilar competition to Humira in international markets will be a big headwind in 2019. Also costs to support expected new product/line extension launches are likely to hurt profits in 2019. Moreover, these new products will be at the very early stages of their launch trajectory in 2019 and will not be a significant offset to international biosimilar impact. Estimates have gone down slightly ahead of Q1 earnings. AbbVie has a positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters.” Get AbbVie alerts:

Funds from spending bill go towards helping ABQ homeless population,nmpoliticalreport.com,Andy Lyman,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://nmpoliticalreport.com/2019/04/06/funds-from-spending-bill-go-towards-helping-abq-homeless-population/,"Courtesy of Chelsea Van Deventer
It started with a break up.
About four years ago, James Moyer’s girlfriend and mother of his children kicked him out of her home. Moyer worked at a major retail store in Albuquerque, but without a car or enough money to pay rent on his own, he resorted to staying in a tent at a nearby city park so he could make it to his 6 a.m. shifts on time. But, Moyer said, showering for work became a problem even with a public pool nearby.
“I would go over to the pool and shower over there, but you could not do that every day. They would find out you were homeless and just taking a shower,” Moyer said. “You’d have to be a little careful about that.”
Besides some of the obvious problems with living at a public park—like worrying about stolen belongings, getting kicked out of the park by police or having a frozen towel in the winter—Moyer said having the dignity of feeling clean was difficult, especially at work. Some days he would be forced to wear extra deodorant or body spray, but was still hesitant to physically get close to coworkers.
“I was worried all the time about smelling,” Moyer said.
With assistance from nonprofits, Moyer was able to get into an apartment three years ago, and he still works at the same job. But, he’ll never forget the importance of a hot shower. And now, he’s working closely with a new nonprofit to help people who still live like he did.
One of the last bills Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed this year was a $30 million spending bill with money for projects ranging from law enforcement to public education. Buried in the dozens of pages of appropriations is $100,000 earmarked for a “rolling clean mobile hygiene program” or more simply, a shower on wheels for those who experience homlessness. While the money goes to the state’s Department of Finance Authority, it will ultimately end up at the project of Albuquerque attorney Chelsea Van Deventer, one that Moyer said could have helped him avoid dingy gas station bathrooms where he often found himself freshening up or shaving.
Van Deventer started her legal career as a public defender, where she said she often witnessed defendants who were essentially being criminalized for being homeless.
She said she hopes to use the financial injection from the state’s general fund to start making major moves towards creating a custom-built trailer that would include both bathroom and shower stalls. It’s something she hopes will provide a semblance of dignity to those who need it.
“It’s about helping people feel like people during the dehumanizing experience of homelessness,” she said.
Van Deventer said she was inspired to start Rolling Clean when she learned about Lava Mae, a California-based program that converts old public buses into mobile hygiene stations.
Lava Mae’s founder Doniece Sandoval, in a letter of support, endorsed Rolling Clean.
“The team at Lava Mae believes in Rolling Clean and honored to provide the organization our full endorsement,” Sandoval said.
Some estimate that there are about 5,000 people without homes in Albuquerque and Van Deventer said she estimates one station could provide 11,000 showers a year. But she said, funding from the state is just the first step and she plans to raise more money through individual donations. Share this:"
"RIC professors tell the tale of East Providence's Kinsley Park, a 'sacred ground for black baseball'",www.providencejournal.com,Kevin G. Andrade,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190407/ric-professors-tell-tale-of-east-providences-kinsley-park-sacred-ground-for-black-baseball,"RIC professors tell the tale of East Providence's Kinsley Park, a 'sacred ground for black baseball' Kevin G. Andrade Journal Staff Writer Kevprojo 30 30 AM
EAST PROVIDENCE — The Haven United Methodist Church may strike people as an odd place to present a conference on the history of baseball. Yet local historians gathered there Saturday afternoon to listen to Francis Leazes speak about Kinsley Avenue and the Titanic.
""I cannot drive by the corner of Kinsley and Acorn without thinking about the Titanic,"" the Rhode Island College professor of political science and public administration told about 20 attendees at the lecture, ""Extra Innings: In Search of Historic Baseball Venues."" It was part of Rhode Island's 34th annual Statewide Historic Preservation Conference, this year focusing on preservation, recreation and sport.
The Titanic connection is related to Kinsley Park, a baseball field and city recreation hot spot that hosted Negro League games as well as integrated games between teams of black players and white players.
The park was on property owned by the Southern New England Railway, which was planned but never built, by tycoon Charles Melville Hays. He died in the Titanic disaster in 1912, and on his person were found money and plans for the railroad. Today, the property is a parking lot.
After Hays' death, his company leased the property.
According to Robert Cvornyek, a professor of sports history at RIC, the first professional baseball game there happened in 1921 between the Cleveland Colored Giants — a team made up of black players — and the Providence Independents — made up of white players.
The setup was part of an experiment called the International League, but soon afterward, the Colored Giants would call Providence home while keeping the Cleveland name at the outset.
""After that game, the league collapsed and they were stranded in Rhode Island,"" Cvornyek said.
Three years later, under the auspices of Arthur ""Daddy"" Black, a businessman who made his money ""playing the numbers,"" Cvornyek said, the team became the Providence Giants and played games against white teams as well as black teams. It was one of the last attempts to commercialize black baseball before the Great Depression hit.
""Sad thing is, 'Daddy' Black walked away [in 1931] from the project because it wasn't as profitable as he hoped,"" Cvornyek said.
That year, Black sold the team to Daniel Whitehead, a local baseball player more interested in the sport than the business end of operations. He changed the team's payments to players from a monthly salary to one based on ticket sales, and ""the players mutinied as a result,"" Cvornyek said. ""For all intents, commercial black baseball is dead after that.
""So, Kinsley Park is sacred ground for black baseball.""

A constellation of Hollywood stars could be getting subpoenas to testify in the legal battle between Woody Allen and Amazon, according to The Hollywood Reporter . In documents filed Friday, Amazon cited a list of celebrities who have said they would not work with Allen because of a sexual abuse allegation against him, including Judd Apatow, Cate Blanchett, Timothee Chalamet, Colin Firth, Greta Gerwig, Griffin Newman, Ellen Page, Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard and Mira Sorvino. “Each of these individuals could soon be on the receiving end of a deposition request,” the publication said. Allen is suing Amazon for $68 million for terminating his multi-picture deal based on an accusation he abused his daughter decades ago—a charge he has long denied. Amazon says Allen’s comments about the #MeToo movement made him a liability. Stars Could Be Called to Testify in Woody Allen-Amazon Suit Cheat Sheet ®"

Following the first instalment , here is a second update from Crumblybottom…
We rejoin Sir Toby Amadeira, the MP for the West Country seat of Crumblybottom, after a rather bruising encounter with his local party officers. He decides to visit the famous Crumblybottom market. Being surrounded by rich West Country farmland, it is a veritable cornucopia of local delights and Lady Amadeira has given him a list of things that she would like him to get. It is also a complete contrast to all things party political and so he reaches it having put Brexit and politics out of his mind. On his arrival he bumps into a man called Tony, a local marine engineer, whom he last met while out canvassing during the 2017 election.
Tony : So what’s this then Toby, I gather you have helped delay our Brexit?
Toby : No, the Prime Minister asked for an extension.
Tony : Why don’t we just leave? Everyone is fed up of all this mucking about you lot are doing in Parliament, we just want to leave now, we have waited the two years, surely we can now go?!
Toby : It is a bit more complicated than that, it would be chaos if we just left.
Tony : But all my mates say that since they don’t know what is going to happen, all they have been able to prepare for is a so-called No Deal, so they are ready.
Toby : I think you will find that the CBI and IOD disagree with your mates.
Tony : Look Toby, the CBI speak for some of those big companies, many of whom aren’t even British-owned, many of them having no real loyalty to this country. The businesses I and my mates run trade all over the world, are British-owned and British-run and we can’t just sell up and open a new factory in Germany if we wanted to. You look round here – ask any of the traders in this market and I bet you over 90% want out and want out now.
Toby : Good to see you again, I am afraid I will need to go and do my shopping.
He heads to one of the stalls selling cheese, chooses one of the many local farmhouse varieties and hands it to Doreen to be weighed.
Doreen : Well Sir Toby, a bit of a mess this Brexit malarkey is, isn’t it?
Toby : Yes, I suppose you could say that.
Doreen : We down here voted to Leave, but you lot in Parliament seem determined to prevent us from leaving. Look at this so-called deal Theresa May brought back from Brussels, it ain’t Brexit, as far as I see it, we stay in but without any representation – that’s not Brexit. That Juncker said that deserters would be punished and it seems he will have got his way if that goes through. I know you don’t like it Toby, but we voted Leave; I know you didn’t, but you asked us to decide for you and we voted Leave. I want you to go back to that Parliament and tell them that we have done our two years and we should now Leave, no ifs and no buts, just Leave. That will be £8.90 and none of your euros please.
Toby makes his escape and goes to buy some fruit and vegetables. Josh sources his produce from all over the world and has a large wholesale business bringing fruit and veg from all four corners of the globe and yet loves nothing better than manning his Crumblybottom stall.
Toby : Hello Josh, what are you recommending at the moment?
Josh : We have some delicious brassicas and mange tout from Guatemala, fabulous apples from New Zealand and Chile, paw paws, melons, you name it, we have got it. I don’t really get involved in politics, Toby, but you see all this stuff here that I bring in from outside the EU, we have to pay 12% duty on it to protect EU growers but we can’t grow any of it in this country. I see this new No Deal tariff that has been brought out would mean that I would not be paying any tariffs on those items if we left the EU with No Deal. That would save my customers money, why are we not leaving now under those terms? Also, the VAT I have to pay on some of my imports I will not need to pay straight away to HMRC but can process through my VAT return. Those two things would really help my business a lot, bring it on Toby, let’s go WTO!
Toby : I knew HMRC had made some proposals, but didn’t realise they had gone that far with No Deal planning.
Josh : I have been impressed by HMRC, they have come up with some very good systems to keep trade moving. The transitional simplified procedures are excellent, all designed to keep trade moving. We need to move on and just Leave Toby, tell the rest of them MPs that we need to Leave now and we are not afraid of a No Deal – in fact we would positively welcome the certainty it would bring. It seems to me that anything else will just bring further uncertainty, delay, prevarication and time wasting. It is nearly three years since we voted and it does not appear as if we have moved far since then, apart from getting thoroughly fed up of you lot trying to sabotage the popular will.
Toby picks his fruit and veg and heads off as quickly as possible to buy some lamb from Fred who is a local farmer. Fred is quite a quiet man so Toby hopes that he won’t get a lecture from him too.
Toby : Hello, can I have that shoulder of lamb please?
Fred : I will just weigh it for you. You know Toby, I am so disillusioned with you and your friends in London that I don’t think I will ever vote again, let alone vote Conservative. You are trying to steal the referendum result and you should be ashamed of yourselves. Me, the Missus and all our friends just want to Leave, that is what we voted for and you are trying to prevent it from happening, so you ain’t getting my vote again. That leg is £34. Anything else you require?
Before Toby could make his exit, Beryl, Fred’s wife, chipped in.
Beryl : My sister Bella in Sydney can’t understand what has gone wrong with us, she says she and all her friends can’t believe how pathetic we seem to have become. They can’t understand why we seem to so totally lack the confidence that we are meant to be famous for. Lions led by donkeys, that’s what she says.
Toby had had enough and headed home to be greeted on arrival by a courier wanting a signature for a parcel he was delivering. Toby thought he would just at least confirm one of his reasons for not wanting a No Deal.
Toby : So how is your company prepared for a no-deal Brexit?
Courier Driver : We have a special unit who have been working on preparing for it for two years now. We may be German-owned, but considering all the exercises we have been doing, I would say we are well prepared. The company have drafted in extra planes and have assured all our customers that their goods will still be delivered on schedule, come what may. It is the only sort of Brexit we have been able to prepare for, I’d say bring it on, we have had enough of all this uncertainty. That EU lot are a bunch of wasters, all their fine dining and moving their Parliament back and forth every few weeks at our expense. Let’s just get on with it, politicos are the problem, they don’t have a clue about the real world. I think they still believe we are writing out paper waybills with quill pens and carbon paper. With electronic invoicing and barcoded waybills the goods are cleared into the country of destination almost before we have picked the shipment up from the sender. Best get on got, I’ve another 60 drops to do…

If I remember correctly, the top salary in the WNBA (not rookie, the top salary overall) is something like $130,000. So for Sabrina Ionescu to come back to Oregon for her senior year, she is only risking something in the low 6 figures, while somebody like Zion Williamson is risking something in the order of 7-8 figures.

Calvinball Is the Only Game Democrats Play,spectator.org,Patrick O'Hannigan,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/calvinball-is-the-only-game-democrats-play/,"by Peter Ferrara
P eople hoping to become the Democrat nominee for president in 2020 have recently floated suggestions for dismantling both the Electoral College and the Supreme Court as we know it. These ideas are in addition to the urgency with which many of them also tell the rest of us to be both deeply suspicious of parenthood and greener than Kermit the Frog, in the vain hope that those things might help to forestall climate change .
But if progressive policies are as self-evidently worth pursuing as leftists assume they are , then why do those same people keep moving the political goalposts? Why, for example, did the Speaker of the House endorse a proposal to lower the federal voting age to 16? It’s as though the only game in town were Calvinball , minus the innocence of the original version. Calvin, you might remember, was not above cheating (hence “Calvinball,” whose only rule was that there were no rules). That wildly imaginative six-year-old refused to build snowmen in traditional ways, but neither he nor his indulgent tiger ever waged war against the dead, as leftists are now doing .
That might sound like hyperbole to anyone who hasn’t seen Democrats trying to erase their own past by toppling statues of Confederate soldiers. The activists pushing for changes like that aren’t as cunning the people who bankroll their quest for “justice.” They don’t seem to realize that when Confederate statues are gone, monuments to the valor of Union soldiers will have no meaning, either.
Being “woke” is an essentially reactive stance, because it has to contrast with something asleep or unexamined. But speech cops on the left (and they’re all on the left) don’t understand or care about that. Consequently, Civil War battlefields are being leached of the formative influence proper to them. We’re losing our collective memory of American history, and (in the hotbeds of progressive iconoclasm) ultimately mocking Lincoln’s resolve that “these dead shall not have died in vain.”
Leftists treat history as a tool for the acquisition of power. Anything that can’t be ignored or subverted gets reframed, which is why I don’t think freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or failed Senate candidate Robert Francis O’Rourke are as clueless as they appear to be. “Beto” and the “Breakfast Club Evita” know what their supporters want to hear. When AOC threatens the moderates in her own party but says with a smile that “democratic socialism” means “putting democracy and society first,” or Beto preaches doom from the “coffee shop at the end of the world ,” each is appealing to mal-educated people who mistake youthful ignorance for courage. In a different world, they would be students vying for positions as homecoming king and queen. Instead, they want to be commissars.
Progressives also change rules for the living with the nonchalance of people for whom hypocrisy has become a fashion accessory. Had the 2016 presidential election turned out differently, we would not now be hearing politicians take shots at the Electoral College, or pine righteously for “democracy” in what was built as a republic. Anyone who wants to climb on a soapbox to lecture the rest of us on proper governance ought first to be able to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.
Commentator Richard Fernandez noticed that even NBC News describes the progressive strategy for 2020 as an attempt to change the rules . That ideology’s selective notion of being bravely different never made room for traditionalists, but it now holds sway even in things like the dress code for the U.S. House of Representatives.
Progressives argue that outdated systems and social mores need to change, but it’s hard to see their motivation as anything more than opportunism. After all, leftists move goalposts even when there’s no compelling reason to do so. Is there any other way to explain why Democrats unwilling to let the evil of late-term abortion alone pushed past that into providing legal cover for infanticide, while casting themselves as merciful because letting babies die saves their parents the cost of neonatal intensive care?
You can put aside conversations about life and medical care to see that less contentious issues show a similar pattern. Hillary Clinton, for example, has yet to be prosecuted for feigned ignorance (Q: Did you wipe your email server? A: “You mean like with a cloth ?”), gross negligence, or felonious conduct. Meanwhile, Trumpian exaggeration draws swift condemnation from all quarters , the First Lady isn’t regarded as being multi-lingual or photogenic enough to avoid being snubbed by people who wet themselves over her immediate predecessor, and self-proclaimed bastions of free inquiry are nothing of the kind .
Two years into a presidency that has done more to expose progressive insecurities than any other, it’s also safe to say that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian efforts to sway America’s 2016 election started with bad motive and wide latitude. That it ended up vindicating President Trump is almost beside the point. Outcome aside, the investigation’s dominance of the news cycle was exactly what the Beltway Establishment had hoped it would be, if for no other reason than because so many politicians despise (and feel threatened by) the brash populist in the White House.
“March Madness” for progressives is no different from the crazy that they pretend to save the rest of us from in every other month. If your objections to that can be painted as logical, historical, patriarchal, privileged, racist, or cis-gendered, then you are easily marginalized. The only proper response to the way progressives have weaponized grievance and guilt is to refuse to play along.
In gentler moods, we might also remember that Calvin and Hobbes did not end its ten-year run atop the comics page with a game of Calvinball. Instead, on December 31, 1995 , Bill Watterson’s beloved creations signed off from a sled in the snow with an appreciative nod to the wonders of the world around them, as Calvin, with his triangular grin, said “It’s a magical world, Hobbes, Ol’ Buddy.… Let’s Go Exploring!”"
Enforcement Trumps a Border Wall,spectator.org,Debra J. Saunders,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/enforcement-trumps-a-border-wall/,"by Peter Ferrara
Washington
During the two years when Democrats controlled the Oval Office, Senate and House, President Barack Obama squandered a major opportunity.
He failed to push for a vote on a DREAM Act, which would create a path to citizenship for qualified undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as minors. That matter was left for a vote in the lame-duck Congress; and that vote proved to be a gesture, as the Democratic Senate failed to garner the needed 60 votes. America will never know how it might have ended if Obama had put his back into it.
Ever since, Obama’s failure to push for this key promise of his 2008 campaign remains an object of contempt among conservatives — who presume Democrats preferred to dangle the issue through the 2012 election and gin up resentment among Latino voters.
With President Donald Trump’s failure to push Republicans to change immigration laws when they controlled the White House and both houses of Congress in 2017 and 2018, Trump may find himself in that same corner of shame.
With 1 million or so undocumented migrants expected to cross the southwest border this year, Trump’s commitment to building his signature border wall doesn’t seem to be doing the trick, and he hasn’t focused on measures that actually could improve the nation’s immigration machinery.
When Trump first got into office, a big drop in southwest border apprehensions suggested his anti-immigrant campaign rhetoric had such a chilling effect that his promised wall might be superfluous. But then the numbers began to climb.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen recently argued that a law which prevents immigration officials from promptly returning minors from the so-called Northern Triangle countries and a court decision that limits how long the government can hold minors serve as loopholes that “create a functionally open border.”
That’s why Mark Krikorian of the pro-enforcement Center for Immigration Studies always has argued that changing immigration law and enforcement would be far more effective than building a wall — not that he’s opposed to spending on a wall.
Trump’s push for the wall shows that he is working to keep to his 2016 campaign promise: But it really can’t do much to discourage economic migrants who ultimately would not qualify for asylum but nonetheless believe they will be able to get into the United States through a port of entry.
That’s the problem with Trump’s beloved wall. It may resonate with his base, but it won’t bring about the changes the base wants.
And it’s hard to get Republicans — many of whom do not share Trump’s view on illegal immigrants — to die on a hill for a big-ticket item which the public opposes and politicians doubt will work.
Krikorian doesn’t think it’s too late for Trump to switch his focus to changing the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act so that federal officials can send undocumented minors who don’t qualify for asylum back to non-contiguous countries the same way that they can return minors from Mexico and Canada.
Could such a measure make it through the Democratic House? Not now, but that could change if the flow of migrants through Mexico continues at such dangerous levels.
“Politically it is essential for the Republicans to make it clear that (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi and (Senate Minority Leader) Chuck Schumer are the reason we have this border disaster,” said Krikorian. “They are playing the part of (German Chancellor) Angela Merkel in inviting an unlimited number of people to come to the United States.”
Krikorian believes that the GOP Senate should put its efforts on reworking immigration law so that it doesn’t encourage border chaos.
It doesn’t help when Trump says, as he did Friday morning, that he wants to “get rid of the whole asylum system.” It was another act of verbal self-sabotage that showed an executive ready to bar not only economic migrants, but also refugees fearing for their lives.
The week’s antics with the president’s since-retracted threats of closing the border with Mexico only reinforce a portrait of an executive who hasn’t focused on a goal — reducing illegal immigration — so much as on winning.
So, Trump claimed victory Friday morning because Mexico has done a better job of enforcing its southern border under his threat. Does anyone think that will last when the mercurial president takes his eye off the ball?
I get how the Trump base cheers on the president’s ability to drive the left crazy with his rhetoric: But it’s not going to fix a humanitarian crisis.
