I wouldn't say that they evolve by genetic mutation, but morals change and adapt to new circumstances. I think the period around 200 years ago saw an evolutionary change in morals in England, at least. The period shows society becoming increasingly sensitive to pain and suffering. It was the period when anti-slavery societies became a thing, also feminism and animal rights movements are traced back the period. Anesthesia also became increasingly refined and a focus of medical attention. Some are born to sweet delight. Some are born to endless night. Mustn't forget the Romantics, either."

If the aboriginals had recognized the truth that Everyone has a right to live here and that trade is part of living together we might have got on with it 200 years ago.

In my perspective, we didn't violate any rights."

I think our attitude towards altruism and those who benefit from it reveals deeper problems in society. Take Reason's constant railing against 'the nanny state,' for example. The nanny, someone charged with the care of children, is held in contempt. Asylum seekers fleeing oppression, violence and poverty are looked upon with fear and loathing by many commenters here who identify themselves as Libertarian."

That's what I actually wrote.
I didn't even say it would be conclusive evidence.
However, if there were no way to account for the evolution of altruism in the natural world, then that would leave open the argument that it came from somewhere other than the natural world.
That isn't a logical fallacy at all.
In fact, that argument for God is one of the reasons why I started reading up on altruism in the natural world. It's a fascinating topic. The fact is that altruism does arise naturally from evolutionary processes. There are a zillion examples in the natural world. So the argument is preempted by the evidence.
Hell, it turns out ""inclusive fitness"" (altruistic behavior for close siblings to pass on similar genes to your own) isn't even necessary.
http://www.nature.com/news/201 0.427.html
Regardless, IF IF IF there were no observable examples of altruism in the natural world, its existence would be an excellent (if not 100% conclusive) argument for the existence of God.
I maintain that it's the same process we libertarians talk about with the invisible hand and Adam Smith. Why should it surprise libertarians if people pursuing their own interests is entirely compatible with the invisible hand of benevolence?"

It does so in economics. It does so in evolution.
When a marine altruistically throws himself on a grenade to save his buddies, is he being selfish because he cares more about his buddies than he does about himself?

The rich...are led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of life, which would have been made, had the earth been divided into equal portions among all its inhabitants, and thus without intending it, without knowing it, advance the interest of the society, and afford means to the multiplication of the species. When Providence divided the earth among a few lordly masters, it neither forgot nor abandoned those who seemed to have been left out in the partition.

Seniors would still get a basic income under the Green New Deal. It's true that Medicaid would be abolished, but only because the Green New Deal would provide Medicare for all Americans.
You suffer from the delusion that government is limited by the its ability to tax and borrow. Advocates of the Green New Deal understand how Modern Monetary Theory proves that the myth of such limitations is nonsense. When AOC and other GND advocates say they don't understand why people ask how the government would pay for it, they are being sarcastic: they know very well that the skeptics ask this question because they are deluded by outdated monetary theories. They understand that catastrophic climate change is an existential threat with imminent consequences, that government is the only entity capable of addressing climate change, that government has the responsibility to save the planet, and that it must devise the strategeries and order all of the nation's resources to avert otherwise certain doom.
It's that simple. I feel sorry for the children of anybody who opposes the Green New Deal. Like Nazis and slaveholders, their children will be ashamed of them and will be justly be obliged to pay reparations for their parents' sins.

The radical environmentalists hate any technology that improves the standard of living of ordinary human beings.
The attitude of radical environmentalists toward natural gas is illustrative. Thirty years ago, back when all this got started, US environmentalists were all for replacing coal-fired power plants with natural gas since the carbon intensity of the latter is less than half of the former. Of course, they knew that there was no way to do this because conventional natural gas supplies in the US were inadequate. At the time the US was planning enormous LNG import facilities because natural gas demand outstripped domestic supply. Then, a decade later fracking started. Just as soon as environmentalists learned that fracking would provide cheap, domestic source of natural gas, they went from an advocate to opponent of natural gas and began to disseminate all sorts of myths about fracking."
