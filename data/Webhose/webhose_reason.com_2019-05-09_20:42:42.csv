Mestizo peasants who are functionally illiterate in Spanish (forget about English)
unskilled, illiterate, indigent illegals
the unchecked mass influx of illiterate third world migrants.
unskilled, uneducated, culturally bereft, indigent third worlders
ignorant fence hoppers who just want to get free stuff
Note that these opinions on the moral character of immigrants have nothing to do with the speaker's position on immigration itself. They are all gratuitously gross generalizations about the migrants themselves.
If you want more open borders, then the best way to do that is to convince everyone that being opposed to open borders must mean that you're a bigoted asshole. So, keep up the good work, ladies and gentlemen!"

Well, yes. A little money being paid to some little criminals is better than lots of money going to a murderous gang that holds 11 million people in slavery.
I mean, really, how is this even a question? The only thing they're trading for the money is letting 0.0001% of the people out of the chains they slapped on them. You don't fucking get to pretend it's humanitarian to buy slaves from them by pointing to the fact that slavery is awful; you are rewarding their slaving.
Hey, if they announce they're going to execute a thousand infants if we don't give them a billion dollars, should we pay that, too? How can we make those infants pay for the sins of their government?
You want to refrain from fucking shooting the slavers dead because of various practical difficulties, or because the US military should be protecting Americans instead of Cubans, or whatever other reason, fine, there are arguments to be made. You even want to engage in genuine trade for things that are legitimate articles of trade, fine, the world isn't perfect, and where the line is to be drawn is complicated.

The article states that that Specific Preliminary Injunctions are Unconstitutional, but that Hybrid Specific Preliminary Injunctions are Constitutional.
But the Hybrid Preliminary Injunction is two part, the first part being a Specific Preliminary Injunction which if that is Unconstitutional then it would seem to be impossible for that first part when combined with the second part, a trial of criminal contempt to be Constitutional because to get to the second part one must get past the first part, which in Unconstitutional and thus cannot be enforced or even entered.
In other words, if Paula gets a specific preliminary injunction against Don, and Don violates the preliminary injunction his defense in criminal court would seem to be that he has not committed criminal contempt because the preliminary injunction was not valid being Unconstitutional prior restraint.

2. Text that flows to fit the user's screen, even on a mobile device.
I know the legal profession has a centuries-old tradition of using hard-to-understand formats.* And I know that law review editors would revolt if they had to follow these rules. Perhaps articles could be published in duplicate, once to please editors, and again to please readers.
Online publishing can be academically rigorous and user-friendly if the publisher so chooses. Example: any of the many peer-reviewed journals published by Public Library of Science (see: https://www.plos.org/ ).

Of course we know in reality that prosecutors have taken upon themselves to pick and choose which cases they prosecute. An injunction, as you argue, would limit prosecutorial discretion.
As far as prosecutorial discretion, I'm no fan, except in the sense that if the prosecutor has only so much money (s)he should spend the money on the more serious cases, and if the money runs out before (s)he can get to the less serious cases, so be it, you can blame an over-parsimonious legislature.
And if they don't think they have enough evidence to persuade an impartial jury, then far from having discretion, I'd say it would be wrong to prosecute.
But if by prosecutorial discretion you mean the prosecutor going shopping for cases and selecting which ones they feel like prosecuting and which ones they don't feel like prosecuting, how would that be different from the ""dispensing power"" of the old kings of England, rejected by the English Bill of Rights and many American counterparts?"

The doctrine, a rule that gave the government the power to punish broadcasters for being insufficiently balanced, was killed off 21 years ago. It isn't likely to return, despite persistent rumors that the regulation's rotting corpse will crawl from its coffin and disembowel Rush Limbaugh.

Censorship Radio Television Regulation Telecommunications Policy FCC Barack Obama John McCain Lawrence Lessig Elections But you can't blame talk radio fans for worrying. When the Federal Communications Commission enforced the doctrine, from 1949 to 1987, it was a convenient club for politicians and interest groups itching to silence their critics. During the last couple of years, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other prominent Democrats have publicly pined for its return, a change that would effectively require any outlet that transmits Sean Hannity's show to either devote a chunk of its schedule to rebutting him or, more likely, dial back its political programs altogether and air a jock or a psychiatrist instead. Pelosi's party hasn't come close to restoring the rule, but they've handed a powerful political weapon to the opposition: Every time the Dems raise the subject, right-wing radio shows and blogs broadcast the news to an angry conservative base. In a year when rank-and-file Republicans are uncomfortable with their party's presidential nominee, it's a potent way to persuade them to hold their noses and vote for John McCain.
And so the conservative weekly Human Events warns that ""liberals are chafing at the bit, waiting for regime change in Washington to give them the ability to reinstate the ‘fairness doctrine.' "" Michael Medved, the movie critic and AM talker, announces in towering capital letters that ""THOSE RADIO HOSTS WHO CLAIM THAT MCCAIN AND HIS DEMOCRATIC RIVALS ARE ‘INTERCHANGEABLE' SHOULD NOT IGNORE THIS CRUCIAL ISSUE."" And Cliff Kincaid of Accuracy in Media—an organization that never shied from wielding the fairness doctrine against the left—frets that ""if Obama captures the White House and gets the opportunity to appoint the FCC chairman, liberals would then have a 3-2 majority capable of bringing back the Fairness Doctrine through administrative action, without the need for congressional approval.""
It won't happen, says Obama. On June 25, in a savvy political move, his press secretary sent an email to the industry journal Broadcasting & Cable . Deftly deflating the scare, the secretary stated flatly that ""Sen. Obama does not support reimposing the Fairness Doctrine on broadcasters.""
Now the bad news. There's a host of other broadcast regulations that Obama has not foresworn. In the worst-case scenario, they suggest a world where the FCC creates intrusive new rules by fiat, meddles more with the content of stations' programs, and uses the pending extensions of broadband access as an opportunity to put its paws on the Internet. At a time when cultural production has been exploding, fueled by increasingly diverse and participatory new media, we would be stepping back toward the days when the broadcast media were a centralized and cozy public-private partnership.
Such threats might not rile up the red-state base the way the fairness doctrine does, in part because it's far from clear that the GOP would be any better. Under its current chairman, Republican Kevin Martin, the FCC has been no friend to either free enterprise or free speech. It has sharply increased federal restrictions on the media, with a sanctimonious crusade against ""indecent"" broadcasting; new regulations for satellite radio, wireless phones, and other communications industries; and an attempt to assert unprecedented powers over cable TV. ""Martin is the most regulatory Republican FCC chairman in decades,"" says Adam Thierer, director of the anti-censorship Center for Digital Media Freedom. ""He wants to control speech and will use whatever tools he has to get there.""
An Obama FCC might mean still more steps toward reregulation. Coming on the heels of Martin's commission, it could also mean a relative reprieve—even, in some areas, a move away from command and control. A lot depends on events, and a lot depends on which interest groups acquire the most influence in his administration. Here are four factions to keep an eye on.
The Players
The idealists . There is a loose coalition on the left that calls itself the media reform movement. Its members are rarely the most powerful people in the room, but they inevitably shout the loudest. They gather in public-interest groups—Free Press, Public Knowledge, the Media Access Project—that cast themselves as populists fighting the major media corporations, which they accuse of centralizing power and shutting out dissident perspectives. In their more libertarian moments, they'll call for opening up more spectrum, loosening copyright controls, and rolling back culturally conservative restrictions on speech. Prominent reformers will also, alas, support a host of new economic regulations and speech controls.
Some members of the movement, such as the communications historian Robert McChesney, prefer to stress the reregulation. In his 2008 book The Political Economy of Media , McChesney goes so far as to describe ""private ownership of media"" as one of ""the primary internal impediments to a viable free press."" Other reformers, such as the legal scholars Lawrence Lessig and Tim Wu, aren't so statist; even when they call for new controls, they say they prefer broad and simple rules aimed at encouraging innovation, not diktats meant to force a specific outcome. ""We need to radically carve back on the scope and reach of what the FCC is doing,"" Lessig says, ""not to the world of no regulation, but to the world of regulation for the objective of facilitating proper competition, not protecting against competition.""
Lessig has met with Obama to discuss technology policy, and while he has his disagreements with the candidate—he didn't appreciate Obama's vote this year to give telecom companies retroactive immunity for illegally assisting government spies—he strongly supports the Democratic ticket. From the other end of the coalition, McChesney told the National Conference for Media Reform in June: ""Our job doesn't end if he's elected. It begins. But at least we're in play.""
Incidentally, Trinity Church, the controversial house of worship that Obama attended until May, is affiliated with the United Church of Christ, a body that has been heavily involved with the media reform movement. During the last few years, the church has urged the FCC to limit product placement on television, to refuse to renew the licenses of stations that don't offer enough children's programming, to let more low-power radio stations on the air, to block media consolidation, and—yes—to restore the fairness doctrine.
Minority broadcasters . Obama has the overwhelming support of the black community. Generally speaking, that includes blacks in the broadcasting business. The Democratic coalition has a history of calling for more minority-owned enterprises, and that's not likely to change during an Obama presidency.
There's some overlap between this group's goals and those of the media reform movement. Public-interest lobbies frequently proclaim the need for more racial diversity in both ownership and programming, and organizations such as the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters (known by the delightful acronym NABOB) often join the reformers in condemning concentrated ownership of the media. But the two policy programs are not an exact match. When the small businesses that make up much of the minority broadcasting community look at some of the regulations endorsed by the reformers, they see red tape and bureaucratic discrimination. David Honig, a veteran of Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition who now runs the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council, has fiercely criticized the FCC for the ways ""regulation acts as a filtering device to guarantee entry by favored groups and to discourage entry by disfavored groups.""
Naturally, the tune changes when the regulations favor minority ownership. Both Honig's group and NABOB think the commission should prefer nonwhite applicants when awarding broadcast licenses.
Tech support . Barack Obama may consult with activists eager to bring the media and telecom companies to heel, but he receives plenty of industry support as well. Some of those companies donate money to both candidates, but the lion's share of the loot is going to the Democrat. As of July, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, Obama had received $12,351,351 from the communications and electronics sector, as opposed to just $3,055,535 for McCain. The computer and Internet industries favored Obama over McCain, $3,729,991 to $920,554; TV, movie, and music companies preferred Obama as well, $4,701,382 to $815,451. (Telephone utilities, on the other hand, gave $379,835 to the Republican and $249,072 to the Democrat.)
This pattern has alarmed Obama's supporters in the media reform camp. Writing in May, McChesney and The Nation 's John Nichols warned that ""industry money is going to Obama in anticipation of his victory."" At the National Conference for Media Reform, McChesney added that the reformers would need to ""apply pressure"" from the other direction.
It's worth noting, though, that the reformers and industry aren't always at odds. The most prominent example is net neutrality—the idea, endorsed by Obama, that Internet providers should not discriminate in price or priority between different uses of the Net. Like the reformers, but for its own self-interested reasons, Google strongly supports legal enforcement of this principle. As of July, Google accounted for $373,212 in donations to the Obama campaign.
The bureaucracy. And then there's the commission itself, which has its own momentum. ""The FCC is, structurally, an independent agency,"" points out Kevin Werbach, an assistant professor of legal studies at the Wharton School, a prominent champion of spectrum reform, and an Obama supporter. ""The president selects the chairman and nominates the commissioners, but the president does not tell the FCC it must rule this way or that way on a particular proceeding.""
Both of the current Democratic commissioners, Jonathan Adelstein and Michael Copps, have supported increases in regulatory controls, with Copps in particular leading the charge against both vulgar broadcasting and media mergers. Neither is likely to leave next year. For some observers, that alone is enough to indicate what to expect from a new administration. It's ""not hard to envision an Obama FCC—just read the speeches and opinions of Adelstein and Copps, and you're there,"" says Ben Compaine, co-editor of the Journal of Media Economics . (Both Adelstein and Copps declined to be interviewed for this article.)
With those frequently conflicting forces in the background, here's how the most important issues at the FCC might play out under Obama.
'Indecent ' Speech
In the last seven years, the commission has ramped up its war on ""indecency,"" levying unprecedentedly high fines and attempting to extend its influence into cable and satellite broadcasting. (Under current law, its rules against swearing and smut do not apply to such subscription services.) This shift of policy actually preceded 2004's Super Bowl debut of Janet Jackson's right breast, but the crackdown has only intensified since then, with steeper fines and sillier targets.
""Give credit where it's due,"" says Thierer. ""Obama is pretty good on this issue."" The Democrat's official technology plan condemns violent, sexual, and bigoted speech and images in the media, but it also states directly that the candidate ""values our First Amendment freedoms and our right to artistic expression and does not view regulation as the answer to these concerns. Instead, an Obama administration will give parents the tools and information they need to control what their children see on television and the Internet."" That's a far cry from the views of Kevin Martin, who once said, ""You can always turn the television off and, of course, block the channels you don't want. But why should you have to?""
That said, the bureaucratic momentum on this issue favors the current crusade. In 2004, People asked the man who put Martin in charge of the FCC what to do about ""foul language and sexual titillation"" on television. Bush's reply: ""They put the on/off button on TVs for a reason."" It was a wise answer, just like Obama's comments about the First Amendment. And it didn't prevent the crackdown.
""I don't follow Obama as much as I follow the FCC,"" says Matthew Lasar, a left-leaning historian at the University of California at Santa Cruz and a frequent contributor to the tech site Ars Technica . ""Think in terms of what he's going to inherit."" The drive for higher indecency penalties isn't coming only from the Republican chairman. On the Democratic side, Adelstein and Copps are enthusiastic censors as well, with Copps in particular urging the commission to come down harder on vulgar expression. In 2004, when the agency fined Clear Channel $755,000 for a series of crass radio skits and some related incidents of improper recordkeeping, Copps objected that the company's stations should have paid even more—or, better still, lost their licenses to broadcast altogether: ""I am discouraged,"" he wrote, ""that my colleagues would not join me in taking a firm stand against indecency on the airwaves.""
""Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein are pretty invested in the indecency process, because it brings various parties together around the issue of believing in regulation,"" says Lasar. ""They see this as a way to draw people into the pro-regulator camp."" Reversing that trend would mean facing down an entrenched independent bureaucracy. ""I'd be surprised if Obama can make much of a dent in that, assuming he really wants to,"" Lasar concludes.
Congress, too, seems attached to regulating indecent language. The judiciary, however, may be leaning in another direction. In July the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit ruled that the FCC ""acted arbitrarily and capriciously"" when it fined CBS $50,000 for Janet Jackson's nipple slip. In a similar case, involving the government's right to punish stations for airing unplanned, fleeting four-letter words, the 2nd Circuit rebuffed the commission on the same grounds, adding that it was ""skeptical that the Commission can provide a reasoned explanation for its 'fleeting expletive' regime that would pass constitutional muster."" The government has appealed that decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court will hear the case soon.
Local Speech
During the last few decades, radio stations have relied increasingly on programs produced elsewhere. With voicetracking technology, a DJ in Dallas can record hours of shows for stations around the country in less than 30 minutes, complete with regional references to be inserted into different outlets' transmissions. Meanwhile, local musicians and community activists often have trouble getting any airtime at all.
It's technologically feasible to let the locals start small stations of their own, but regulators have made that a long, cumbersome, and expensive process. The entry barriers range from costly technical requirements to outdated channel separation rules that tighten the number of available licenses.
The obvious solution is to reduce those barriers. But you'll also hear calls to compel existing stations to make room for more locals, or to require broadcasters to air other kinds of ""public interest"" programming. Think of it as the flip side of the indecency debate: This is the speech that everyone professes to like , at least when it takes the form of broad buzzwords such as diversity and localism and not actual programming that might offend people.
In January, for example, the FCC released a report on broadcast localism, which among other recommendations suggested that each station should ""convene a permanent advisory board made up of officials and other leaders"" to advise it on ""community needs and issues."" The report also declared that the commission should give aggrieved listeners ""more straightforward guidance"" on ""how individuals can directly participate in the license renewal process.""
It sounds mild—but then again, so did the fairness doctrine, which merely asserted that stations should ""afford reasonable opportunity for discussion of conflicting views on matters of public importance."" When ""individuals"" decide to ""participate"" at license renewal time, that's when would-be censors crawl out of the woodwork. The United Church of Christ, for example, has distributed a manual to activists with advice on how to target a station for termination. It includes a sample petition, filed by Rocky Mountain Media Watch in 1998, urging the government to ""protect"" the public by refusing to relicense a Denver TV outlet, on the grounds that its newscasts ""are severely unbalanced, with excessive coverage of violent topics and trivial events, and, consequently, inadequate news coverage of a wide range of stories and vital social issues. In addition, newscasts present stereotypical and unfavorable depictions of women and minorities.""
Imagine having to contend with such petitions, from both the left and the right, every time you have to ask the FCC for permission to keep broadcasting. Even if you get to keep your license, it'll mean spending more time and money dealing with the hassle. The natural impulse will be to throw some bones to your critics, especially the ones who have managed to land spots on your community advisory board.
For some Republicans, the suggested regulations are a way to bring the fairness doctrine back into the conversation. In a June letter to Kevin Martin, House Minority Leader John Boehner charged the FCC with a ""stealth enactment of the Fairness Doctrine,"" arguing that ""the recreation of pre-1980s advisory boards will place broadcast media squarely on a path toward rationed speech."" A group called Save Christian Radio worries that since the community advisory boards must be ""broadly representative of an area's population,"" the new rules could mean that ""Christian broadcast stations could be forced to take programming advice from people whose values are at odds with the Gospel.""
Maybe yes, maybe no: The FCC is still receiving citizen comments on its initial proposals—most of them running against the idea—so it's hard to say how onerous the final rules will be, if indeed they're passed at all. But if you're worried about an Obama administration, this is where there's the most potential for mischief. The candidate has broadly endorsed rules requiring more local programming. He also supports a proposal the Martin commission has rejected: shortening the time between broadcast license renewals from eight years to two.
Much of the media reform movement has endorsed these ideas. The minority broadcasting community is less enthusiastic. In the spring, the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council and the Independent Spanish Broadcasters Association submitted comments to the commission criticizing the localism report, arguing that ""many of the proposals...would have a disproportionate negative impact on minority broadcasters because of their relatively small size and limited access to capital."" In particular, ""very few small, local broadcast owners can afford to formally administer the permanent advisory boards.""
Opening Up Spectrum
A better way to promote localism is to allow more local stations on the air. At this point the technical cost of starting a station is so low, and the potential competition for advertising is so cutthroat, that an open marketplace might actually favor small, volunteer-run, noncommercial outlets created out of a passion for music or to express a particular point of view. For a rough comparison, look at the Internet, where passion-driven websites proliferate even when e-commerce hits a downturn.
Ushering in those stations requires little more than loosening the federal government's grip. Simply allowing FM broadcasters to use the space allocated to TV channel 6, for example, could make room for thousands of new stations around the United States. But that option, like many others, has been shut off, largely because the National Association of Broadcasters is good at persuading Washington to protect the incumbent industry from competition.
Unsurprisingly, the lobbyists who push hardest for these barriers are often the first to protest the public-service regulations beloved by the media reform movement. Meanwhile, the media reformers can suddenly sound like libertarians when the topic turns to letting community groups start their own stations. Many of them, in fact, support even more sweeping changes to the FCC's controls on the electromagnetic spectrum. In his 2001 book The Future of Ideas , Lessig wrote that ""the only thing that government-controlled spectrum has produced is an easy opportunity for the old to protect themselves against the new. Innovation moves too slowly when it must constantly ask permission from politically controlled agencies."" The real debate, he argued, is between those who think spectrum should be treated as private property and those who believe new technologies allow the ether to function as an open commons.
Both Obama and McCain would probably be pretty good on the specific issue of allowing more community outlets. William Kennard, the Clinton-era FCC chair who championed licensed low-power radio, is an Obama adviser. McCain initially opposed the idea—in 1999 he suggested that anyone who wants to start a low-watt station should get ""a Web page or a leased access cable channel"" instead—but he has reversed himself since then. Last year he co-sponsored the Local Community Radio Act, which would allow more stations on the air.
It's harder to imagine either candidate pushing for sweeping spectrum reform. But there is one policy debate that could propel that issue onto the table: the question of ""white spaces,"" unused spots in the spectrum between the frequencies used by TV broadcasters. Many in the media reform movement have been pushing the FCC to open those areas to unlicensed devices delivering wireless Internet access. Microsoft unveiled a prototype last year that it said could use those spaces without interfering with television signals. (So far the commission doesn't agree.) A number of free market economists, meanwhile, have called for the FCC to auction off the spaces and let different potential users bargain for the right to use them. Still other policy watchers have called for a mix of the two approaches. What all these ideas have in common is that they would allow much more flexible uses of spectrum, pulling the FCC back from its role as the zoning board of the airwaves and setting a precedent for larger reforms.
Even if Obama's appointees let that happen, industry lobbies could still stop the idea. ""I would expect the National Association of Broadcasters would do what they did with low-power FM,"" says Lasar. ""They'd take a fear-mongering campaign to Congress and make some sort of bid for a law to restrict what the FCC can do."" Legislators of both parties, he argues, are ""pretty susceptible to the National Association of Broadcasters' position, which is that unlicensed broadband applications will create a gigantic crisis for the entire broadcasting industry, will interfere with TV, will interfere with medical devices, will ruin the world. Which they have all but said in FCC proceedings.""
Back-Door Regulation
In a June debate before the conservative Federalist Society, former FCC chief Reed Hundt, serving as a surrogate for Obama, said the candidate ""doesn't think there should be any more media consolidation until new policies are developed to promote diversity and localism."" The candidate himself co-sponsored a bill last year to prevent the FCC from loosening the rules restraining newspapers from owning broadcast stations and vice versa.
Meanwhile, out in the marketplace, the media have been going through a wave of de consolidation, most of it market-driven. CBS recently announced that it will sell off 50 radio stations. Clear Channel, the biggest radio chain, put more than 400 stations up for sale in 2006. Time Warner has been spinning off properties for years. It's weird to work up a sweat about media monopolies at a time when the media themselves are sweating over the new forms of competition they're facing—weirder, at least, than it was a decade ago, when the headlines were filled with mergers and AOL Time Warner stood like a colossus atop the horizon.
The persistant concern with consolidation would be harmless, even productive, if it manifested itself as a sustained effort to let more people onto the airwaves. But that's not where it seems to be heading now. An FCC on the prowl against ""media monopolies"" is an FCC that's more willing to interfere with future mergers. Not to block mergers, but to extract concessions.
Last year America's two satellite radio companies, XM and Sirius, asked the government for permission to merge. Thirteen months later, the Federal Trade Commission approved the deal. Four months after that, the FCC agreed that the marriage should go forward, but it also attached some conditions to the ketubah . Among other commitments, the combined company would have to cap its prices for three years, extend its service to Puerto Rico, and offer ""à la carte"" programming packages in which customers can unbundle their subscriptions and pay only for particular channels.
In other words, the FCC imposed new controls on a single business, and it did so without the rulemaking procedures that are ordinarily required before regulations can be adopted. In the process, it may have found a way around institutional impediments to its power. The ""à la carte"" proposal, for example, has been enthusiastically supported by Chairman Martin (and by John McCain), who thinks it would be a good way to help viewers avoid indecent programming. It is less popular among the people who run niche channels—including, by and large, the minority broadcasting community—because it will cut into their potential audiences. So far Martin hasn't been able to make the idea law. But if he can impose it on enough cable companies through the back door, a formal change to the federal code might not be necessary.
This isn't a new threat. The Bell Atlantic/NYNEX merger of 1997 started the ball rolling, with a series of conditions the companies embraced ""voluntarily"" before the FCC approved the combination. But the agency has grown more brazen since then, as commissioners from both parties learned to love the process. Given that bipartisan backing, neither Obama nor McCain is likely to restrain them. The industry hasn't protested much either. When the government imposes company-specific laws, you can divide most businesses into two categories: those that have managed to survive the process and those that aren't affected by the conditions.
The good news is that the commission refrained from restricting what XM/Sirius could actually put on the air. (Clear Channel, for example, had asked the FCC to bar the satellite network from offering any local content, thus insulating its terrestrial stations from space-based competition.) But as these back-door regulations grow more common, it's easy to imagine a future commission insisting that, say, a media conglomerate submit its cable channels to the same indecency rules imposed on over-the-air stations.
Convergence
It used to be easy to divide the broadcast issues at the FCC from the other areas it regulated. Not in the Internet era, when you might find yourself receiving TV shows over your phone lines. Today, some of the most intrusive restrictions on broadcasting aren't even enforced by the FCC. It's the Federal Election Commission that restricts the content of paid political speech during a campaign, and it's the Copyright Office that imposes onerous fees on Web radio stations, threatening to drive the entire industry off the Net.
Within the FCC, the issues surrounding broadband deployment could become a foothold for controls on online expression. Consider the adventures of M2Z, a California-based company that wants to build an ad-supported national broadband network in which consumers can pay extra for speedier connections. In 2007 it asked the FCC to grant it the spectrum for free. When the commission refused, the company sued to overturn the decision. Then Kevin Martin proposed another sort of back-door regulation: The government would auction off the spectrum, but it would attach conditions on how those airwaves could be used—conditions that happen to dovetail with M2Z's original business plan.
You needn't be fond of the incumbent wireless industry—hardly free market heroes—to appreciate how inappropriate it is for the government to tilt the scales in a single firm's favor. But it wasn't just wireless companies and supporters of equal treatment who protested Martin's plan. Civil libertarians were aghast, because Martin's conditions included a requirement that the auction winner filter pornography from its free tier of services.
At press time it's unclear whether Martin's slanted auction will ever take place. But there's a broader issue at stake. When the commission starts granting favors to companies in exchange for regulatory concessions, it's just a matter of time before those regulations include restrictions on speech.
That's the threat to fret about under the next FCC, be it Democratic or Republican. It's hard to imagine President Obama trying to bring back the fairness doctrine: Even if he's prone to breaking his campaign promises, it's just dumb to invite a fight with a big, noisy enemy that's able to instantly mobilize an army of angry listeners. The real danger is more subtle and more mundane. It's a bipartisan bureaucracy slowly, steadily increasing its power.

Police Police Abuse Use Of Force Crime Rarely has that reality been more stark than now, with five Dallas law enforcement officers fatally shot during a demonstration against, yes, the killing of black civilians by police. The sequence is a spiral of violence, with wrong done against one group answered with wrong against the other.
Up to the moment gunfire erupted, the Dallas scene was a case where both sides were conducting themselves well. The protesters were peaceful, and the police were restrained. Some officers and marchers even posed for photos together. It was heartening proof that the two sides are not condemned to conflict.
But too often, police-citizen encounters go very differently. Cops deal daily with dangerous offenders in areas plagued by incessant crime. Innocent citizens in those neighborhoods sometimes are stopped, searched, humiliated and physically abused. People who should be working together for mutual safety find themselves at odds.
The Black Lives Matter movement is a recent reaction to an old problem made more visible by modern technology and social media. Lots of Americans who once took for granted that police deserve respect and deference have been shocked by video footage of officers killing without apparent justification.
A 2015 Gallup Poll found trust in police at its lowest level in 22 years. Only 30 percent of African-Americans express such confidence.
The deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile at the hands of police officers help explain why. Slayings like theirs happen more or less every day in this country. But unless the event or its aftermath is captured on video, it is barely noticed by the general public.
Research indicates that black and Hispanic motorists are likelier to be pulled over, to have their cars searched and to be arrested—though whites are often found to be likelier to have contraband. A new study by the Center for Policing Equity at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York documents that cops use force against blacks more than three times as often as against whites.
The murdered police in Dallas obscure a positive development: Since 1977, reports University of California, Berkeley law professor Franklin Zimring, the number of officers killed on duty has plunged by 69 percent.
Cops and their defenders say that when officers kill civilians, they do so in self-defense, which often is true. Maybe information will come to light that the cops behaved justifiably with Sterling and Castile—in response to actions that didn't show up on the videos.
In some cases, though, the reaction is excessive. Laquan McDonald, shot 16 times by a Chicago officer, was walking away from the cops. Eric Garner, who died after being subdued with a chokehold, had no weapon. John Crawford, idly holding a BB gun taken off a Wal-Mart shelf, posed no evident threat.
Sterling and Castile were carrying guns, but Sterling's was in his pocket, and from the videos, it appears he didn't reach for it. Castile, according to his girlfriend, told the officer he had a concealed pistol and a permit for it.
But American cops have a pattern of erring on the side of using deadly force, because they generally are trained to do so and rarely incur punishment for it. American police kill civilians at rates five times higher than police in Canada, 40 times higher than in Germany and 140 times higher than in England and Wales.
Is that because we have so much more violent crime, including gun crime? Partly, says Zimring, but ""the U.S. rate of killings by police is 10 times as great as the difference in homicides generally.""
Changes in how departments operate could save hundreds of lives each year. A report this year by the Police Executive Research Forum said, ""Through de-escalation, effective tactics and appropriate equipment, officers can prevent situations from ever reaching the point where anyone's life is in danger and where officers have little choice but to use deadly force."" Such reforms, it argued, can not only protect civilians but "" increase officer safety .""
Making life safer for police and those they encounter is a goal shared by everyone. It will take new approaches, because the old ones are not good enough.

I first came in contact with Tibor in 1969, after listening to his radio show on KPFK in Los Angeles. He had a 15-minute weekly commentary on this left-wing Pacifica-affiliated station, at a time when the left was somewhat more tolerant of diverse views. He impressed me with his coherent and insightful observations about liberty, delivered in his robust voice. I contacted Tibor, and we quickly became friends.
At the time, I was a litigation lawyer at a mid-sized Los Angeles law firm. I had become a libertarian at New York University (NYU) Law School in the early 1960s, after studying with Sylvester Petro and Ludwig von Mises (who taught at the NYU Graduate School of Business) and becoming acquainted with Murray Rothbard, who was then working on his magnum opus, Man, Economy, and State .
There was an embryonic libertarian movement, barely visible to the general public. During that period, there were several small-circulation libertarian magazines, mostly short-lived. Tibor asked me if I'd like to come to Santa Barbara to meet Bob Poole and talk about taking over a magazine called reason .
We were all young and highly motivated, and we were all libertarians. Tibor and Bob were more influenced by Ayn Rand, while Mises and Rothbard were my mentors.
Tibor gave me excerpts from Atlas Shrugged to read. Although he was a devoted admirer of her work, Tibor had been ""excommunicated"" by Rand in the 1960s for a letter he sent to her to clarify a question he had. But he kept in contact with Nathaniel Branden, who actively marketed Rand's work and developed an international movement for her philosophy of Objectivism.
Tibor arranged to interview Branden for reason in 1971—a significant journalistic achievement because it was Branden's first public statement after his dramatic split with Rand in 1968. We vigorously promoted the interview, and this led to a major increase in new subscribers for reason .
During that time, no one had any sense of ""the libertarian moment."" Rather, it wasn't unusual to be referred to as a libertine—and I was once even mistakenly introduced as a librarian.
Tibor, Bob, and I made a unique team. As a philosopher, a systems engineer, and a lawyer, we worked well together from our cross-disciplinary backgrounds.
Tibor was kind and generous of spirit, and he thoroughly enjoyed ideas. He was a prolific writer and an energetic speaker—and although English was not his native language, he was remarkably eloquent. He had an international network of friends, professional colleagues, former students, and admirers—and an exceptional family. He leaves an impressive legacy of work. Tibor's keen mind, his warmth, his passion for ideas and for life, and his friendship will be missed.
Robert W. Poole Jr.
Tibor was born in Budapest in 1939. He was such an individualist that he already loathed Communism as a young teenager. For his own safety, his mother decided to have him smuggled out of Hungary at age 14. Making his way to the United States, he joined the Air Force rather than waiting to be drafted into the Army. There he discovered the novels of Ayn Rand, which led him to attend college at Claremont McKenna College, graduate school at New York University, and finally obtain a Ph.D in philosophy at University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in 1971.
reason founder Lanny Friedlander, for whom I had written an article in late 1969, told me to look up Tibor (who was also writing for reason at the time) when he learned I was about to move to Santa Barbara to take up a new job. Tibor and I became friends, and during 1970 brainstormed the idea of buying reason from Lanny and putting it out on a businesslike basis. I have fond memories of long evenings at Tibor's hillside home, discussing philosophy and imagining what kind of impact a serious libertarian magazine could have. (Yes, in those days a graduate student at UCSB could afford to buy a house in Santa Barbara!)
Tibor had a network of contacts who we hoped would put some money into our startup, and he contacted them while I drafted a business plan. Always entrepreneurial, Tibor obtained a grant to put on a political philosophy conference at the University of Southern California, and the travel budget included funds to fly Lanny from Boston to California so we could negotiate the deal. By that point, Tibor had brought young libertarian attorney Manny Klausner into our fledgling partnership, Reason Enterprises, and Manny worked out all the legal details.
From January 1971 through June 1978 we published every month, like clockwork, but by 1977 it was clear that for reason to have serious impact, we needed full-time paid staff and a serious budget for growth. Tibor, Manny, and I developed the plan for what became Reason Foundation. Thanks to an angel investor, we had enough funds to make the transition, and we opened our doors in downtown Santa Barbara in July 1978.
Tibor was amazingly prolific as a scholar and writer. Among his numerous books were The Libertarian Alternative (1974), Human Rights and Human Liberties (1975), Individuals and their Rights (1989), Capitalism and Individualism (1990), Classical Individualism (1998), and The Promise of Liberty (2009). This is in addition to numerous journal articles and hundreds of popular articles, op-ed pieces, and letters to the editor. I can still recall being at Tibor's house in Santa Barbara and seeing him—in reaction to a news item—dashing to his typewriter to produce a letter or an op-ed piece.
The last time I saw Tibor was at Reason Weekend in Santa Barbara about a year ago. For the Friday night after-dinner event, Editor in Chief Matt Welch interviewed Tibor, Manny, and me on stage, reminiscing about reason 's long history. Tibor also devoted several hours to meeting with a board committee to discuss ways of enhancing the moral/philosophical perspectives in Reason Foundation's efforts. I had no idea that would be the last time we saw him. Several months ago we talked by phone, and I told him about early planning for reason 's 50th anniversary celebrations in 2018. We joked about him needing to take good care of himself so that he could be part of those events. Sadly, that was not to be."

Regulation Transportation Policy Airlines/Airports Controller fatigue is obviously a major factor. The FAA has known about the problem for decades but has repeatedly swept it under the rug. Finally, on April 17, the FAA implemented changes to scheduling practices that will allow controllers more time for rest between shifts. But the changes only address part of the fatigue problem. And they don't face up to the reason for the FAA's repeated failures to deal with the issue.
For decades, even predating the 1981 air traffic controller strike, controllers themselves have had the last word on the schedules they work. One of the most popular is called 2-2-1: Controllers work two swing shifts, two day shifts, and one midnight shift. The second day shifts ends at 2 p.m. and the subsequent midnight shift begins at 10 p.m., just eight hours later. Such a schedule disrupts circadian rhythms, creating fatigue on the midnight shift.
Within air traffic circles, this problem is so well-known that 2-2-1 has long been called ""the rattler,"" since it can come back and bite the controller, degrading his performance. But controllers and their union have fought to keep 2-2-1 because it gives them a three-day weekend afterwards.
The National Transportation Safety Board called for abolishing 2-2-1 in an April 2007 report, and the inspector general for the Department of Transportation has called for a 10-hour minimum between shifts in general, and 16 hours after a midnight shift. It's not clear if the new FAA rules eliminate 2-2-1. And they only increase the minimum time between shifts to nine hours, not the recommended 10.
The other cause of fatigue on midnight shifts is black backgrounds on controller display screens, which require dark rooms for best visibility. But dark rooms tend to induce drowsiness, especially on a midnight shift. It is now common international practice to have light gray background screen displays that can be used in high-light environments, but in the U.S. we've all but ignored this advancement.
The FAA would not tolerate such threats to air safety from airlines, or from mechanics, or from aircraft producers. It regulates all such entities at arm's length—and it has cracked down on airline scheduling practices conducive to pilot fatigue. But the FAA has tolerated 2-2-1 schedules and dark control rooms for decades. Why? Because the Air Traffic Organization, whose job is to ""move air traffic safely and efficiently,"" is within the FAA, which in effect means the agency is regulating itself.
The remedy for this is to separate air safety regulation from the provision of air traffic control services, so as to bring about true arm's-length safety regulation of air traffic control. That may sound like a radical change, but over the past 15 years nearly every developed country (except the U.S.) has made this change, consistent with policy set forth by the International Civil Aviation Organization.
There's another important reason for doing this now. The FAA is in the early stages of the biggest change in air traffic management since the introduction of radar in the 1950s. It's called the NextGen system. Using new technologies and process automation, NextGen will permit planes to fly closer together safely, adding much-needed capacity to airports and airspace. But this will require careful assessment of the trade-offs involved. The safety regulator making those assessments will have far more credibility if it is independent.
The current controller-fatigue flap is actually a wake-up call. For NextGen to succeed, we need an independent aviation safety regulator. And that means we must separate the Air Traffic Organization from the FAA.

As a result, taxpayers pay for more than 48,000 airport security screeners and TSA has requested nearly $8.2 billion in funding for 2011.

Regulation Terrorism Airlines/Airports Homeland Security Creating the massive bureaucracy was a mistake. Even though the quality of airport screening was low before Sept. 11, it was not a failure of the ""rent-a-guard"" screeners that let those 19 terrorists board planes ""armed"" with box cutters. Those ""weapons"" were perfectly legal at the time. The real failure was one of policy, which didn't make use of passenger history and law enforcement information that should have flagged most of the terrorists as suspicious characters who warranted enhanced scrutiny.
Even with today's bloated TSA, that problem still exists. Consider that our various intelligence agencies failed to share vital information, and a suspected terrorist, the underwear bomber, was allowed to board—and tried to blow up—an international flight bound for Detroit on Christmas. Thankfully, the Obama administration last week took some needed steps to help fix this problem.
Following Sept. 11, most other countries increased their standards for airport security by letting each airport implement its own procedures under government supervision. In Europe, that led to nearly all major airports hiring certified private security firms to do their screening. Canada created a new federal agency to implement better screening but outsourced the actual screening. This kind of high-performance contracting permits better training and airport-specific flexibility (e.g., higher pay scales in Canada's jobs-rich oil patch) and it better matches screener numbers to changing travel patterns and airport passenger levels.
In contrast, the system Congress and the George W. Bush administration created came with a massive conflict of interest: TSA serves as both the aviation-security regulator and the provider of key security. Who's watching the watchmen? When it comes to baggage and passenger screening, TSA is regulating itself. As with any bureaucracy, its natural incentive is to hide errors and make itself look good. In addition to the obvious conflict of interest, this also makes for fragmented airport security.
Consider that airport perimeters, air cargo and other aspects of security are not operated and managed by TSA, but by airports. This lack of cohesion can create security gaps. In Europe, each airport is directly responsible for every aspect of its security, under strict government oversight.
The other mistake of the Bush administration and Congress was to let general taxpayers get stuck with well more than half the cost of airport security. Canada's security ticket tax pays for 100 percent of airport security. In most European countries, a combination of airport charges to airlines and security taxes on tickets covers the complete cost of airport security.
Those who object to making airlines and passengers pay the full cost will argue that protecting against terrorism is like national defense, for which everyone properly pays via general taxes. However, many taxpayers never fly, and numerous others rarely fly. Airlines and frequent travelers like me get far more benefits from aviation security, and we should be paying the costs.
So now what?
First, TSA should be divested of its airport screening duties. TSA should regulate and oversee security, but each airport should be responsible for all aspects of its security (passenger and baggage screening, perimeter security, etc). Airports would be free to hire their own security forces or contract with TSA-certified firms.
Second, the cost of airport security should be paid for by those who use airports: a combination of airlines and passengers. This change would cut billions from the federal budget, eliminating the large portion of airport security costs not covered by current airport or airline security taxes. It also would make the costs of airport security more visible to airlines and travelers.
If these two changes are made, they will put much-needed scrutiny on the expensive, one-size-fits-all airport screening procedures in place now. Giving airports control over their security and moving to a more risk-based approach to passenger screening might well cut the cost of airport screening in half. It also would focus more attention on high-risk passengers like those we should have spotted on Sept. 11.

Terrorism Airlines/Airports Two egregious security failures allowed this to happen. First, despite an explicit warning from the terrorist’s father, his name did not get added to either of the TSA’s lists—the 4,000-name no-fly list or the 14,000-name selectee list. Had he been on the latter list, he would have been subjected to secondary screening at Amsterdam Schiphol airport, where a routine swabbing of his hands and/or carry-ons would likely have revealed traces of the PETN explosive.
But even if this trace-detection had not been carried out, the PETN which the terrorist concealed in his underwear would have been detected had he been required to pass through one of the 15 of millimeter-wave body-scanners now in use at Schiphol. But airport officials there maintain that they are not permitted to use these machines for U.S.-bound passengers (though TSA has disputed that).
Both failures reflect the flawed philosophy that underlies U.S. aviation security policy. For the most part, it continues to be fixated on keeping bad things—as opposed to bad people—off of airplanes. It also implicitly assumes every passenger is equally likely to be a terrorist, so every passenger must get equal treatment, except in extreme cases. That’s why it’s so hard to shift potential bad guys from the Department of Homeland Security’s much larger databases to TSA’s selectee and no-fly lists. As a libertarian, I agree that we should be very leery of forbidding people to fly without good reason. But requiring potentially high-risk travelers to undergo secondary screening (especially since we do some of this randomly, in any case) is hardly the end of the world.
In fact, shifting to a risk-based approach to aviation security would likely mean increased security and lower costs, both for the TSA and especially lower wasted-time costs for most travelers. Under a risk-based approach, air travelers would be divided into three groups: lower-risk, ordinary, and higher-risk. The three groups would be treated differently, for very good reason.
Lower-risk people would be those with active government-issued security clearances and anyone who joined a risk-based “trusted traveler” program by passing an FBI background check and getting a biometric ID card. These people would get streamlined processing at airports, similar to what existed pre-9/11. (Note that TSA’s sister agency within the Department of Homeland Security, Customs & Border Protection, operates a number of similar programs for U.S. citizens returning to this country, such as the recently expanded Global Entry program.) Higher-risk people would be those placed on an expanded selectee list and would be subjected to mandated secondary screening, including a body scan, backed up (if necessary) by a full body search. Now that terrorists have started hiding explosives in their underwear and body cavities, we have no alternative to these intrusive measures.
This risk-based approach would be significantly more effective than current practice in dealing with the increasingly serious threat of airborne suicide bombers. It should be supplemented by beefed-up control of access to planes and their cargo holds on the tarmac at airports, to thwart those who would place bombs on board without getting on board as passengers.
Fortunately, the Flight 253 bomber failed, due largely to his own incompetence. But unless we shift to a risk-based security policy, the next such attempt could well succeed.

Should Facebook and Twitter Censor Themselves? A Debate. -,reason.com,Zach Weissmueller,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/reasontv/2018/11/16/social-media-censorship-soho,"Should social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube only remove users who make true threats or incite violence? Or do they have an ethical obligation to hold their users to a higher standard?
That was the topic of a recent public debate hosted by Reason — a West Coast version of the popular New York City-based debate series, The Soho Forum —pitting Thaddeus Russell , author of A Renegade History of the United States and host of the Unregistered podcast , against Ken White , an attorney at Brown, White & Osborn, author at the legal blog Popehat , and co-host of the podcast All the President's Lawyers .
Russell argued that corporations that accept tax breaks and public subsidies should be more accountable to the public. White held that social media sites deserve the same set of speech rights and limitations as ordinary citizens.
Both speakers agreed with the broader libertarian point that private websites have the legal right to do what they want. The debate hinged on a broader point: What should the culture of free speech, free expression, and ownership look like on our social media platforms?
It was an Oxford-style debate, in which the audience votes on the resolution before and after the event, and the side that picks up the most votes wins. White won the debate by picking up 20 percent of the votes.
The debate was held on November 1, 2018, at Reason's Los Angeles studio.

As a place for sipping tea or Co' Cola, smoking or dipping, telling stories, courting, and watching lightning bugs, the front porch was unsurpassed. Southern porches have been celebrated in song (""Swingin'"" and ""My Tennessee Mountain Home,"" to name just two country music examples) and story (Zora Neale Hurston: ""It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk.""). James Agee wrote about a porch in A Death in the Family (Samuel Barber set his words to music in ""Knoxville: Summer of 1915""), and who can forget Faulkner's Greek chorus of neighborhood men, sitting on the Bundrens' porch in As I Lay Dying ?

Regulation Sure, the actual activity of porch sitting (if activity is the word for it) has largely succumbed to the assaults of air conditioning, cable television, and migrants from places with cold evenings. Many new Southern homes substitute a solipsistic deck out back for the traditional front porch. But Southerners are still nostalgically attached to porches as icons of old-timey leisure and sociability, and they crop up in unlikely places. Durham, North Carolina's alternative newspaper, for instance, heavily into things like healing crystals, opens each issue with a section called ""The Front Porch."" One of the Charlotte airport's interminable corridors displays photographs of Charlotteans sitting on their porches. And new, planned, neo-traditionalist developments like north Florida's Seaside have reintroduced porches in a hopeful attempt to build community. Yes, we take our porches seriously down here.
So when the Appearance Commitee of Wilson, North Carolina, a small town in the eastern part of the state, decided to do something about how the place looked, it was no surprise that they started with the town's front porches. It was no surprise either that when they proposed a ban on upholstered furniture they ran into some resistance from folks who like their porches just the way they are.
The committee came up with some lame excuses about eliminating breeding places for rats and fleas, but the real objection was that the stuff just looks so trashy . As committee member Sarah Rasino told The Charlotte Observer , ""Upholstered furniture exposed to the elements becomes waterlogged, deteriorates, and the stuffing falls out. Homes that have upholstered surfaces on porches tend to have trash in the yard, too. It goes hand in hand.""
There's a class angle to this, of course. Like much of the South's traditional culture, porch sitting survives in its least self-conscious form among poor and working-class folk, black and white. It isn't the country-club set, after all, who enjoy waving as the cars go by. Moreover, these are the same folks who often can't afford air conditioning or cable TV. The problem, as the Appearance Committee sees it, is that they often can't afford decent-looking porch furniture either--or at least that they see no reason why they shouldn't furnish their porches with beat-up old sofas or recliners that have outlived their usefulness in the living room.
To Wilson's embarrassment, the smart-ass metropolitan newspapers had a lot of fun with this story, and some of my academic colleagues played along. Emory University historian Dan Carter lamented in The New York Times what he saw as ""the ultimate yuppiefication of the South,"" adding tongue-in-cheek that ""there's nothing more inviting than an old front seat from a 1957 Chevrolet sitting on a front porch."" Charles Reagan Wilson of the University of Mississippi told The Charlotte Observer that the proposal was ""an outrage,"" a violation of the Southern ""idea of the outdoors as a livable space."" He invoked Dolly Parton and the memory of Elvis Presley, and groused, ""Next thing, they'll ban pink flamingos in front yards.""
But for all the talk of ratty porch furniture as a regional tradition, what the Appearance Committee really threatens is a different Southern tradition altogether, one that W. J. Cash wrote about in The Mind of the South nearly 60 years ago: the region's ""intense individualism."" In the Old South, Cash argued, this trait was found not just in the Southern planter, ""wholly content with his autonomy and jealously guardful that nothing should encroach upon it,"" but also among ""the farmers and the crackers [who] were in their own way self-sufficient, too--as fiercely careful of their prerogatives of ownership, as jealous of their sway over their puny domains, as the grandest lord."" Decades later, Cash wrote, Southerners still saw the world ""as, in its last aspect, a simple solution, an aggregation of self-contained and self-sufficient monads, each of whom was ultimately and completely responsible for himself."" And the ""ruling element"" in this tradition was ""an intense distrust of, and, indeed, downright aversion to, any actual exercise of authority beyond the barest minimum essential to the existence of the social organism.""
This down-home libertarianism is still with us, celebrated in dozens of country songs by singers like Hank Williams Jr., Charlie Daniels, Bobby Bare, Merle Haggard, and David Allan Coe. In 1976, journalist Roy Reed described it for readers of The New York Times . The South, he wrote, is ""given [its] dominant tone by men--and women who acquiesce in this matter--who carry in their hearts or genes or livers or lights an ancient, God-credited belief that a man has a right to do as he pleases. A right to be let alone in whatever plain of triumph he has staked out and won for his own. A right to go to hell or climb to the stars or sit still and do nothing, just as he damn well pleases, without restraint from anybody else and most assuredly without interference from any government anywhere....It is no accident that the most determined holdouts against land-use legislation in the United States are country people from the South. They will take care of their own land, and let the next man take care of his. If the next man puts in a rendering plant or a junkyard, that is his business.""
Reed argued that this is yet another Lost Cause, lost ""about the time [a man] lost the irretrievable right to take a leak off his own front porch"" (a porch activity I forgot to mention). But, he wrote, ""they have not yet taken [Southerners'] right to curse and defy.""
And that's about the size of it in Wilson. Last I heard, there was a whole lot of cursing and defying going on, but the appearance commissars seemed determined to stick to their guns. And that's a shame. Although I actually sympathize with their motives (I live in a neighborhood full of university students), something more important than appearances is at stake here. If a man can't choose his own damn porch furniture , what the hell can he choose?
I say they can have my La-Z-Boy when they pry it from my cold dead fingers.

As somebody noted up-thread, there's generally a very narrow window to apply to leave the union, without much in the way of advance notice. And there's the omnipresent threat of retaliation if you do try to leave.
It's not an accident that unions have a reputation for violence. A court ruling had even exempted them from RICO for using violence, if it was to further a legitimate union purpose!
There are plenty of reasons why you might not leave the union even if you're unhappy about being a member. After Janus? There's one less reason."

It's the responsibility of the contractor building something to build what the customer is paying for. The general contractor had no experience with adobe, so they neither hired nor supervised the contractor who installed the adobe facings."
