Thousands of Indigenous People Protest Bolsonaro's Deforestation Policies,www.democracynow.org,,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/25/headlines/thousands_of_indigenous_people_protest_bolsonaros_deforestation_policies,"Thousands of Indigenous People Protest Bolsonaro’s Deforestation Policies Headline Apr 25, 2019
In Brazil, thousands of indigenous peoples and their allies are rallying in the capital Brasília, protesting a massive assault on their rights and territories by ranchers, miners and the government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. This is Kawaua Apurina of the Apurina tribe.
Kawaua Apurina : “We are tired of being murdered. We are tired of not having our lands demarcated. We are tired of this genocide, ecocide with the indigenous peoples. We’re defending the planet!”
The protest comes as new data from the World Resources Institute show nearly 9 million acres of pristine rainforest were cut down in 2018—with most of the destruction caused by clearcutting in the Amazon. The data show deforestation is still on an upward trend, with losses accelerating in Brazil, where loggers and cattle ranchers are pressing further into indigenous territories, aided by the government.

"U.K., Irish Politicians Join Funeral for Murdered Journalist Lyra McKee | Democracy Now!",www.democracynow.org,Democracy Now,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/25/headlines/uk_irish_politicians_join_funeral_for_murdered_journalist_lyra_mckee,"U.K., Irish Politicians Join Funeral for Murdered Journalist Lyra McKee Headline Apr 25, 2019
And in Belfast, funeral services were held Wednesday for Northern Irish journalist Lyra McKee, who was shot in the head by an Irish nationalist militant last week during riots in the city of Derry. Leaders from both sides of Northern Ireland’s political divide appeared side by side at the funeral; they were joined by British officials and leaders from the Republic of Ireland in St. Anne’s Protestant cathedral.
At Wednesday’s funeral, a friend revealed that just hours before she was murdered, Lyra McKee said she was about to propose marriage to her partner, Sara Canning.
A group calling itself the New IRA , which opposes the 1998 Belfast Agreement peace accord, has claimed responsibility for the murder, though it didn’t identify the shooter. Ahead of Wednesday’s funeral, Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald condemned the assassination.
Mary Lou McDonald : “So it’s past time now for these groups that masquerade as Republicans to pack up and pack it in, to end their activities and to let the people get on with the work of building a new united Ireland, that Ireland that we all want, an Ireland that will be a tribute to our patriot dead and to all who died, the Ireland in which Lyra McKee should have lived.” The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

In London, climate activists with the group Extinction Rebellion concluded 10 days of civil disobedience on Thursday by disrupting the center of London’s financial district. Some activists glued themselves to the entrance to the British Treasury. Others targeted Goldman Sachs, the London Stock Exchange and the Bank of England. Over the past 10 days, more than 1,100 activists have been arrested as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests. Among those arrested on Thursday was Phil Kingston, who marked his 83rd birthday by climbing onto the roof of a train.
Phil Kingston : “I’m here because I have a belief that there is something greater than us, which tells me that we don’t own this Earth. So, I am just not accepting that we treat it as though it is our just property to do with what the heck we like. And it’s doing terrible damage. The current economy is now using 1.7 Earths, and we in the human population are being taught that this is the way of life. It isn’t. It’s the way of death. And that’s because the more we take, the less there is for future generations, for the poorest peoples, who already got next to nothing, and the rest of others in human nature, which is as important as we are.” Topics: Climate Change The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, as we spend the remainder of the hour with award-winning Filipina journalist Maria Ressa, the founder of the independent news site Rappler, vocal critic of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Ressa has been arrested twice in recent months by the Philippines government, as Duterte cracks down on critics and the media. In February, she was detained in a cyber libel case that’s widely seen as politically motivated. She was arrested again in late March for allegedly violating a ban on foreign media ownership. Duterte has long attempted to shut down the Rappler, which has published groundbreaking work on Duterte’s deadly so-called war on drugs that’s killed thousands of people. Duterte has repeatedly described the site as “fake news.”
PRESIDENT RODRIGO DUTERTE : You are a—a fake news outlet. And I am not surprised that your articles are also fake.
AMY GOODMAN : Duterte has also called reporters who ask him tough questions “spies,” and warned that, quote, “Just because you’re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination.”
While Duterte’s government has attempted to silence Maria Ressa, her journalism has been praised around the world. In December, she was honored as one of Time magazine’s persons of the year in 2018, and just this week named one of Time ’s 100 most influential people of 2019. On Wednesday, she won the 2018 Tully Free Speech Award at the Newhouse School at Syracuse University. We are joined by Maria Ressa right now.
Congratulations on everything that you’ve accomplished. I’m not going say congratulations for going to jail, though it might be a badge of honor, because, clearly, what Duterte is doing is attacking you for representing the press in the Philippines. But talk about why he put you in jail twice in the last months.
MARIA RESSA : I think it’s just to let us—so, I was arrested twice in about five weeks and detained once. And, you know, I have to say, I think it’s just to make sure that I feel the power of the state. It’s something that—the pace of all of this has been unprecedented. And I’ve covered the Philippines for more than 30 years. In 14 months, we’ve had 11 cases filed by the Philippine government. I’ve posted bail eight times. And then it just keeps coming. We’re going to face every single one in court. And I could face decades in jail if we lose them. And one of the things that always—it just hit me a few days ago that since January 2018, when we’ve really begun facing all of this, we have not won one single motion—not one, regardless of how ridiculous the cases are.
AMY GOODMAN : Explain what he’s charging with you. What’s this foreign ownership issue, the tax issue?
MARIA RESSA : So, I think you have to look at the whole thing, and it’s about three years long now. It’s preceded by attacks on social media, astroturfing, right? It’s fake. They seed it, it grows, and people think it’s real. And the first attack is that—was actually by pro-Duterte bloggers saying that—random question by one of the ones who become a government official, underneath—she headed social media for the presidential palace. Her first question was: “Is Rappler CIA ?” It begins there. And then, what’s seeded is that Rappler is foreign-funded. The actual case is that we’re controlled by foreigners. So ludicrous, precisely because even in the Philippines we’re known for our independence.
The thing that’s most alarming for me, though, is the fast pace of something called the cyber libel charge. In this one, a story we published seven years ago, before the actual cyber libel law was enacted, is being used against us to say we violated the law that didn’t exist yet. I don’t know how else to—you know, when I first saw it, I laughed. The National Bureau of Investigation, its own lawyers threw it out. And yet, a week later, it’s resuscitated, and now it’s in court.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to go to what happened when you were just released from jail, just this small clip.
MARIA RESSA : You cannot harass and intimidate journalists to silence. We’ll stand up and fight against it. And as long as we are a democracy under a constitution, which has a bill of rights, we will demand our rights be respected.
AMY GOODMAN : So what happens to you when you are detained? And have you dealt directly with Duterte, the president of the Philippines?
MARIA RESSA : I have. I mean, the last interview I did with him was December of 2016. And the interview that I did with him in October 2015 actually helped bring him to the attention, helped the critics of President Duterte point out that Rappler, because we covered him fairly, actually helped him get elected. Certainly, he knew the power of Rappler, our millennial demographic, and that’s perhaps part of the reason that we’re under attack.
But I think there’s something far more insidious that’s happening now. It’s normalizing these attacks. You know, when you say a million times that I’m a criminal, even though it’s not true, people begin to believe. And that’s what happened first on social media: The attacks became normal. And then people who had never met me then began to believe it. Then, a year and a half later, when President Duterte comes down and says, you know, Rappler is owned by foreigners, the cases began a week later, and we’re sandwiched there.
It’s a tough place to push back, but I think it’s truly important to do that, because this is the time—I think this is a pivotal moment for Philippine democracy. This is the time when we have to fight for the rights that are guaranteed by the constitution. We have elections coming up, May 13th. And if we lose an independent Senate, I think it’s only a matter of time before the Philippines get a new constitution.
AMY GOODMAN : What does that mean, if you lose an independent Senate?
MARIA RESSA : A lot of things, that have been—we’ve had a Senate that’s been able to block certain things, like the formation—like a new—
AMY GOODMAN : So, not the same party as Duterte.
MARIA RESSA : Yes. There were enough opposition votes that they were able to stop a new constitution being ratified, all right? So, our House of Representatives—Congress is essentially a rubber stamp now. And the Senate, in the past, was holding the line. Now it looks like we’re slated to bring in an administration Senate in the May 13—on May 13th, in a few weeks’ time. If that happens, it will only be a matter of time before the House passes a new constitution, parliamentary in nature, federalism, which is something that President Duterte wants. Not saying that federalism is not democracy, but this particular draft will fundamentally change our democracy. So, for Filipinos watching, this is our last chance. You know, we may no longer be a democracy in the way that we know it.
AMY GOODMAN : So you have Duterte saying, “Just because you’re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination.” What gives you the courage to keep taking him on?
MARIA RESSA : I don’t really look at it as taking him on, you know? I do a job. My job is to hold power to account. Rappler, we do stories that the president, that—lots of people don’t like our stories. President Aquino didn’t like our stories. But that is the task of what a reporter does, right? So, his rhetoric is a noise for me. And while it does send a signal to the government bureaucracy—certainly the cases were triggered by President Duterte—it shouldn’t stop us. And certainly, we shouldn’t allow harassment, intimidation and the fear of that stop you from doing your job. So, as far as I’m concerned, we keep going, until the constitution is changed, if that’s the case, right? We demand the rights that are guaranteed not just by the Philippine constitution, but by the bill of rights. We have a constitution similar to the United States.
AMY GOODMAN : Rappler is known for exposing the so-called war on drugs, but where thousands of Filipinos have been killed.
MARIA RESSA : Can I correct how much? It’s not just thousands. And this is Michelle Bachelet at the U.N. who used this number. The latest estimate is, since July 1, 2016, until early this year, more than 27,000 people killed. That’s a U.N. estimate, right? The Philippine police will say—will admit they’ve killed more than 5,000 people. Even that number is huge. But there’s another bucket that they go off: It’s more than 30,000 homicide cases under investigation. This parsing of the details allows lies to continue.
AMY GOODMAN : And explain who is being killed. I mean, President Duterte himself has boasted about murdering people.
MARIA RESSA : He has. And before he even became president, in an interview with me—John Oliver wound up running this—he admitted he killed people, that he killed three people, and that he would continue. You know, another phrase that was used often is that, “When I’m elected, if I’m elected, the fish in Manila Bay will be fat,” because he’ll throw dead bodies in Manila Bay, right? That was the implied statement there.
Who’s being—these are not the drug dealers who are being killed. These are the poor people. These are in the poorest of the poor areas. And this is also where you can see, in statistical surveys, support in this demographic has waned President Duterte. The people who cannot defend themselves, the people who are on a list, a random list, that is not backed. There is no trial. There’s no proof that the people being killed are even drug dealers. I think this is dangerous, in a country that has no rule of law, that normalizes extrajudicial killings. We have to demand better.
AMY GOODMAN : And President Trump, his support of President Duterte, how does that affect policy in the Philippines? How does it affect you?
MARIA RESSA : Well, when President Trump called CNN and The New York Times fake news, a week later President Duterte called Rappler fake news. I think it is a bad time for the world when the former beacon of democracy, the fighter for press freedom and human rights, is noticeably absent. And I think you’re feeling that all around the world. Simultaneous to that, though, is the American technology companies that have allowed cheap armies on social media to roll back democracy, a new weapon used against journalists. This is psychological warfare, right? And when you’re attacked—
AMY GOODMAN : You’re holding up your phones.
MARIA RESSA : Yeah. When you’re attacked—at one point I was getting 90 hate messages per hour. Per hour. You can’t even—it’s a whole new thing. So, anyway, how do we deal with it? We continue doing our jobs. We demand accountability. We tell our people. And I think the problem, though, is that—I think maybe same in the United States—is, in the Philippines, fear is palpable. And if it’s not fear, it’s apathy. People want to duck until this time period is over. And I think what it—
AMY GOODMAN : Well, you clearly aren’t. And I want to thank you so much for being here. Five seconds, a message to the world about the importance of press freedom.
MARIA RESSA : Press freedom is not just for journalists. I think this is a critical time for democracy around the world, both in the Philippines and in the United States. And you must fight for your rights while you still can.
AMY GOODMAN : Maria Ressa, I want to thank you so much for being with us, founder, CEO ,executive editor of Rappler, an acclaimed Philippines news website, has been arrested twice in recent months.
I’ll be speaking Saturday night at UC Berkeley , 6:00—check our website—on the occupation of Western Sahara. I’m Amy Goodman. Thanks for joining us.

Roe v. Wade Under Threat: Planned Parenthood Pres. Speaks Out as State Laws Threaten to Ban Abortion,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/26/roe_v_wade_under_threat_planned,"president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to go beyond Trump’s gag rule, just the latest in a series of attacks on reproductive rights here in the United States, as 28 states, more than half the states, consider legislation to ban or restrict abortion in various ways. Among the slew of strategies are trigger bans, to make abortion completely illegal in a state should Roe v. Wade be overturned, and six-week abortion bans. Earlier this month, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine signed into law a six-week abortion ban, what some call the fetal heartbeat bill. It bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, something that typically happens just six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women even realize they’re pregnant. The bill does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest. A similar law is set to take effect in Mississippi in July, while judges have for now blocked these six-week bills from going into effect in Kentucky and Iowa. Can you talk more about this? And I know that you at Planned Parenthood don’t like to refer to these six-week abortion bans as “fetal heartbeat” bills, and if you can explain why?
DR. LEANA WEN : Well, I’m a doctor and a scientist, and I have to call it as it is. And what it is, what these bills are, are essentially a ban on all abortions, because, at six weeks, most women don’t even know that they’re pregnant. And we’ve seen, this year, 16 states introduce bans on abortions as early as six weeks.
And we need to call out how extreme these bans are. The bill that passed in Georgia, is expected to be signed by the governor any day now, allows the state to investigate women for miscarriages. In Alabama, there is a bill that would impose a Class A felony on doctors, sentencing doctors who perform abortions to up to 99 years in prison. There was a bill in Texas—that failed—but that bill would have the—would impose a death penalty, capital punishment, the death penalty, for women who seek abortion care. And more than 300 people came to testify in favor of this bill that would impose the death penalty on women.
If there’s any doubt about what’s happening around the country, we just have to look at the legislation that’s been introduced this year, and what politicians, these anti-women’s health politicians, are saying about it. They are saying, blatantly, boldly, that what they are trying to do is to overturn Roe v. Wade . They want for these extreme bills to make their way up to the Supreme Court to overturn Roe . And that’s what’s at stake here. What’s at stake is the right to safe, legal abortions. And we know what happens when that right is taken away, because we have the examples around the world and we know what happened in the U.S. pre- Roe , which is that thousands of women died. And we cannot go back to that time.
And that’s why Planned Parenthood is fighting back with everything that we have. We are opposing these rules. We’ve fought back many of these bad bills. And we’re also working with our champions across the country to protect and expand the right to reproductive healthcare, because we know that reproductive healthcare and women’s healthcare must be treated as what they are, which is healthcare, and that the vast majority of the American people support women making their own healthcare decisions, not politicians telling women and families what we should be doing with our health and our bodies.
AMY GOODMAN : Dr. Leana Wen, we want to thank you so much for being with us, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, first physician to lead the organization in nearly 50 years, also the first Asian American and first immigrant ever to hold that office.
When we come back, we’ll spend the remainder of the hour with the award-winning Filipina journalist Maria Ressa, founder of the independent news site Rappler, a vocal critic of the Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has just imprisoned her twice. Like Dr. Leana Wen, Maria Ressa was just honored by Time magazine as one of the most—as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. This is Democracy Now! Back with Maria Ressa in a minute.

"Planned Parenthood President: Trump's ""Pro-Life"" Agenda Is Killing Thousands in the U.S. and Globally",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/26/planned_parenthood_president_trumps_pro_life,"president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to turn to the Trump administration’s attack on reproductive rights here in the United States. A second federal judge has blocked a gag rule that would have stripped federal funding known as Title X for Planned Parenthood and other clinics that refer patients for abortion or even mention abortion as an option. The judge’s ruling halts the gag rule, which was announced by President Trump in February and was scheduled to go into effect May 3rd. Washington state Federal Judge Stanley Bastian ruled against the changes to Title X funding Thursday, saying they would require clinics “to face a Hobson’s choice that harms patients as well as the providers.” This came two days after an Oregon judge issued a preliminary injunction to stop the gag order from going into effect, calling the rule a “ham-fisted approach to public health policy.” Oregon Federal Judge Michael McShane said, quote, “At the heart of these rules is an arrogant assumption that the government is better suited to direct women’s health care than their providers,” he said.
Title X covers non-abortion services like STD prevention, cancer screenings, contraception; provides over $280 million in funding for 4 million mostly low-income women every year.
Talk about the significance of what happened this week in two states, two federal judges saying no to the Trump administration, and what the Trump administration is trying to do with this gag order that was supposed to go into effect next week, Dr. Wen.
DR. LEANA WEN : What the Trump administration is trying to do with this gag rule is to prevent doctors from fulfilling our ethical obligation. When I became a doctor, I took an oath that I would always provide honest, full and accurate information to my patients. To restrict what I can say, to have the Trump administration or any politician telling me what I can and cannot say to my patients, is just unethical, unconscionable and, frankly, unthinkable. This is the reason why over a hundred medical, nursing, public health groups, including the American Medical Association, American Nurses Association, American Public Health Association, have stood up in strong opposition to this Title X gag rule, because we know that it would force us to compromise the oath that we took to serve our patients, and also that it would not happen for any other aspect of healthcare. I mean, how ludicrous would it be if doctors now cannot tell our patients who come for insulin and who have diabetes—if we cannot tell them about where they can go to get insulin, a life-saving and life-changing treatment?
And so, this ruling is important because it is a preliminary injunction that blocks this gag rule from taking effect. It also continues to allow Planned Parenthood and other health centers to continue serving millions of patients around the country who depend on us for primary and preventive services. As you said, Amy, Title X provides for affordable birth control, breast and cervical cancer screenings, STI treatment, HIV testing. In many parts of the country, this is the only way that individuals with low income, who live in rural areas, are able to get access to healthcare. And taking that away, we know the consequence, which is that people are going to delay getting healthcare. Cancers are going to end up getting diagnosed later. There will be increased rates of STIs and unintended pregnancies. That’s what happens when people cannot get the reproductive healthcare that they need.
AMY GOODMAN : So, again, give us the scenario. A woman comes into your office, and she says, “What are my options?” If this gag rule were in effect, if she’s just learned that she was pregnant, you, as a doctor, would not be able to even say—forget referring her somewhere or to a Planned Parenthood clinic even, you couldn’t even say, “Your options are keeping the baby or terminating the pregnancy”? You couldn’t say “terminating the pregnancy,”“abortion”?
DR. LEANA WEN : Well, here’s the thing. Congress has made it very clear, by passing laws about it before, that physicians and nurses and providers must be able to provide the full range of options, because that’s what medicine is about. It’s not up to me as the doctor to tell my patients what they should do. My obligation is to provide all the information and empower my patients to make the best decisions for themselves.
Under this gag rule, if a patient came to me and I work at a clinic that receives Title X federal funding, I would not even be able to provide a referral to a woman even if she’s specifically asking for a referral for abortion care. And it’s not even clear what I would be allowed to do if it’s medically necessary in order to save her health; if she has a life-threatening condition, a condition that threatens her health, if I’m able to make referral in that case.
And I want to point out not only how unethical this is, but also how discriminatory it is, too, because this is saying that if you are a person who’s wealthy, if you have private insurance, you can still go to your doctor and get accurate medical information and the healthcare that you need. But if you are a woman of low income, if you are a family with low income, not only can you not get healthcare access, but you would not even be able to get accurate information from your doctor. This is just one more example from the Trump-Pence administration of a discriminatory policy that would worsen health outcomes and worsen disparities for those who already face disproportionate barriers to care. The people who receive Title X are those who are uninsured, those who live in out-of-the-way, rural areas. It’s people of color. It’s people who already face these barriers.
And it also puts providers into an impossible position, because either you continue to serve patients or you’re forced to compromise your ethics. And from our standpoint in Planned Parenthood, we cannot accept these gagged funds. We would never force our doctors to censor themselves. We would never provide care to our patients that’s anything less than full, accurate, honest, the same compassionate, high-quality, nonjudgmental care that we provide through our 600 health centers across the country now.
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask about the global gag rule. Shortly after his inauguration in January 2017, President Trump reinstated this controversial global gag rule, the policy originating in the Reagan era banning U.S. funding for any international healthcare group that performs abortion, advocates for the legalization of abortion or even mentions it, even if those activities are funded by non-U.S. money. Then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer commented on that decision.
PRESS SECRETARY SEAN SPICER : Well, I think the president, it’s no secret, has made himself—made it very clear that he’s a pro-life president. He wants to stand up for all Americans, including the unborn. And I think the reinstatement of this policy is not just something that echoes that value, but respects taxpayer funding, as well, and ensures that we’re standing up not just for life, for life of the unborn, but for also taxpayer funds that are being spent overseas to perform an action that is contrary to the values of this president, and, I think, continue to further illustrate, not just to the folks here in this country, but around the world, of what a value we place on life.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s a familiar voice to many, though no longer there, the former press spokesperson for President Trump, Sean Spicer. Dr. Leana Wen, what this means globally, and also for the many groups, explain Planned Parenthood Federation of America’s role globally.
DR. LEANA WEN : Well, I just have to point out the hypocrisy here, because if we truly were to value life, we would be looking to expand access to healthcare, not gut it. Let’s look right here in the U.S. as an example. We have rising maternal mortality right here in the U.S. American women are 50% more likely to die in childbirth than our mothers were. We are the only industrialized country where maternal mortality is going up. African-American women in the U.S. are three to four times more likely to die in childbirth and thereafter than white women. A woman in Georgia is 10 times more likely to die in childbirth than a woman in California. Look at what this administration is trying to do right here in the U.S., which is cutting healthcare access, taking away access to birth control, taking away and sabotaging the Affordable Care Act, that provides care to women, that also allows for women to receive care in pregnancy, and gutting, dismantling Medicaid, that provides care to low-income women, families and children.
I mean, there’s huge hypocrisy right here in the U.S., but that hypocrisy we’ve seen time and time again, and actually first with this Trump-Pence administration’s policies globally. One of the first things that this administration did was to reinstate and expand the global gag rule. And we’ve already seen the impact of this gag rule, because they have taken away funding from clinics, health centers, organizations, that even offer information about abortion care and the full spectrum of reproductive healthcare, which is what abortion is. Abortion is a standard medical procedure that’s part of the full spectrum of reproductive healthcare. And for many people, it is lifesaving. It is a critical procedure. It is a critical part of modern medicine. We’ve seen what happens when people, internationally, do not have access to safe, legal abortions. Actually one-tenth of maternal mortality globally is due to unsafe abortions. Thirty thousand women die every year around the world because they do not have access to safe, legal abortions.
And by the Trump-Pence administration imposing a global gag rule, not only are they worsening maternal mortality globally, in the U.S., what they’re also doing, too, is to take away funding from organizations that provide care for patients with HIV / AIDS , that look to prevent STIs and HIV worldwide. And there are health centers and clinics and organizations that have had to close their doors around the world, that provide food and nutrition assistance to families, that provide care to individuals with HIV infection. And what this Trump-Pence administration is doing is worsening health. And so, I find it extremely hypocritical that they get to call themselves “pro-life,” when what they are doing is worsening health outcomes and leading to more people dying in the U.S. and around the world.

"""A Shameful Week for the U.S."": Trump Admin Guts U.N. Resolution to End Rape as Weapon of War",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/26/a_shameful_week_for_the_us,"president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : The Trump administration is under fire after the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution to end rape as a weapon of war on Tuesday that excluded any mention of sexual and reproductive health. The resolution was gutted after the U.S. threatened to veto the measure altogether unless language referencing reproductive health was taken out due to the Trump administration’s belief the language was code for abortion. The watered-down measure also weakened references to the International Criminal Court, making it harder for women and girls to seek justice.
France’s U.N. ambassador blasted the move, saying, quote, “It is intolerable and incomprehensible that the Security Council is incapable of acknowledging that women and girls who suffered from sexual violence in conflict, and who obviously didn’t choose to become pregnant, should have the right to terminate their pregnancy.”
The resolution was championed by Nobel Peace laureate Nadia Murad, a Yazidi Kurdish human rights activist from Iraq. She was kidnapped by the self-proclaimed Islamic State and held as a sex slave for almost three months.
NADIA MURAD : [translated] We come here today and ask that those perpetrators of genocide be brought to justice. They used Yazidi women as a weapon of war, hence they need to be tried before a special court so that they would be tried for the crimes they committed. Bringing elements of ISIL to justice in the framework of an international tribunal, that tries them for crimes of genocide and sexual violence against women, would send messages to others and prevent such crimes in the future.
AMY GOODMAN : And this is human rights attorney Amal Clooney addressing the Security Council on Tuesday.
AMAL CLOONEY : This is your Nuremberg moment, your chance to stand on the right side of history. You owe it to Nadia and to the thousands of women and girls who must watch ISIS members shave off their beards and go back to their normal lives, while they, the victims, never can.
AMY GOODMAN : The gutted resolution is just the latest in the Trump administration’s hard-line stances on U.N. resolutions. In recent months, they’ve also opposed using the word “gender” in U.N. documents, in what is seen as an attack on transgender rights.
We’re joined now by Jessica Neuwirth, the director of the Human Rights Program at Roosevelt House at Hunter College, the director of the Sisterhood Is Global Institute. She sent a letter Wednesday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo protesting the U.S. stance on the Security Council resolution on sexual violence in conflict. Jessica Neuwirth has worked as a consultant to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on issues of sexual violence in several cases, including a landmark decision recognizing rape as a form of genocide.
Jessica Neuwirth, welcome to Democracy Now! So, talk about what happened at the United Nations this past week.
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : Well, I have to say, it was really a shameful week for the United States. Ten years ago, it was the United States that pioneered the resolution that created an office to deal with sexual violence in conflict and a special representative of the secretary-general at a very high level. And the goal of the 10-year anniversary resolution was to strengthen the mechanisms and move the agenda forward. And while in the end it did that, in some important respects, most of the energy, instead of reinforcing political will, was used to battle this assault by the United States and its continuing threat to veto the resolution, in part because of the language “sexual and reproductive health,” because of references to the International Criminal Court—all the mechanisms that actually do strengthen the work of the U.N. and others around the world to stop sexual violence in conflict, and then, of course, on the sexual and reproductive health, I mean, the services that are most needed by women and girls who have been raped in war zones.
AMY GOODMAN : So, can you talk about the origins of this resolution, that originally Germany put forward, right?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : Germany sponsored the resolution, and, as I said, it was really designed to move the agenda forward. And we’re used to seeing the United States in the U.N. also try to move these agendas forward. And this time around, what we saw was the United States lining up with China and Russia against its allies, its closest allies, like France, Belgium, Germany, the U.K., really blocking efforts to get the resolution passed. And it was only because of the really dramatic compromises that were made that the resolution in the end did pass. And as I said, there are some good things in the resolution that we don’t want to ignore, but it was really shameful, you know, to be an American walking around the halls of the U.N.
AMY GOODMAN : So, the United States forced the U.N. Security Council to remove the words “sexual and reproductive health,” to which people like the French ambassador was outraged, in response saying this is just unacceptable?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : It was a rare moment for ambassadors to be openly voicing that kind of disappointment. The U.N. is a very diplomatic place. But following the passage of the resolution, not only the French, but the South Africans, the Belgians, the British really spoke very strongly.
AMY GOODMAN : Let me go to the British. The United Kingdom’s special representative on preventing sexual violence in conflict, Tariq Ahmad, addressed the United Nations Security Council Tuesday.
TARIQ AHMAD : We regret that the language on services for survivors of sexual violence recognizing the acute need for those services to include comprehensive reproductive and sexual healthcare, including safe termination of pregnancies, did not meet with all the councilmembers’ support. However, Mr. President, it is important that we maintain effort, our consistent efforts, in this respect, and we maintain that progress that we have made on this issue.
AMY GOODMAN : And this is the French ambassador to the United Nations, François Delattre, also speaking Tuesday.
FRANÇOIS DELATTRE : [translated] In the face of certain threats, I would still like to underscore how essential it is, for France and in the name of victims, to ensure that these victims can have access to sexual and reproductive health. This is an essential point.
AMY GOODMAN : That was the voice of the translator. Jessica Neuwirth?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : Yes, and the South African ambassador, I would say, went even further and noted the hypocrisy of adopting a survivor-centered approach, which was one of the wonderful things about this resolution, that it really tried to put survivors at the center of all efforts to combat sexual violence in conflict, and yet, at the same time, denying them the services or our right to access services that are so vitally needed. So, I think what he said was that the message to survivors is that consensus in the U.N. is more important than their needs, despite the fact that the U.N. had just said that their needs should be central to any effort.
AMY GOODMAN : Now, this is nonbinding, but talk about the effects of this on the ground—you’ve long worked on these issues of sexual violence—and what it means to address sexual and reproductive health.
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : Well, the most important thing, which is true for all of these resolutions, many of which have really important and great ideas in them, is to see them get implemented. And so, I think how it will play out on the ground is actually going to depend on how much political will there really is to implement these mechanisms that exist, even though we weren’t able to create more mechanisms. I think one of the important things in the new resolution is a greater support for sanctions for perpetrators. So, I think we have to see: Are these perpetrators actually going to be sanctioned? And can we use the existing tools, which, by and large, have not been effective to date, not because they can’t be effective, but because they just haven’t been used properly? So, I think that what the survivors said, or what Dr. Mukwege, who works closely with survivors, and Nadia Murad said—
AMY GOODMAN : And Dr. Mukwege, of course, of the Democratic Republic of Congo, together with Nadia Murad, are both this year’s Nobel Peace Prize winners—well, the award given in 2018. And both attended this hearing.
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : They both attended. They both spoke very strongly on behalf of survivors and the need for justice. And so, I think what matters the most in the end is what happens after. You know, are these just empty words and a battle over words, or can we really move forward with what is in the resolution, honor the survivors and support them in many ways, including with sanctions and efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice?
Another important point in the resolution that’s new is a focus and, for the first time, a mention of children born of rape. Around the world in these conflict zones, there are children born of rape who face many particular problems. And there is a report coming out, thanks to this resolution, that will focus on their needs and their issues.
AMY GOODMAN : And your letter to Secretary of State Pompeo?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : I wrote to Secretary Pompeo in a moment of tremendous frustration, because it just was—it was just horrifying to watch this destructive effort, which at various points in time seemed like it really could torpedo the entire resolution, which was only saved because of the major compromises that were made, that were so disturbing to so many of us. And so, you know, I just pointed out that the United States had an authorship role in all of this work and that it was such a reversal. And I think we have to remember the context. These are girls and young women who are being raped by ISIS terrorists or Boko Haram, and the first thing they need is reproductive healthcare. And if they become pregnant, the idea that they would be forced to carry to term that pregnancy from rape, caused by rape, has been found by the United Nations and other fora to constitute a form of torture.
AMY GOODMAN : And can’t help but note that President Trump—right?—the world leader who is pushing this forward and taking out references to sexual reproductive health, himself has been accused of sexual harassment and sexual assault by at least 16 women.
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : I think the insensitivity—that’s probably a kind word, the “insensitivity”—of the administration to the needs, in general, of women, even here in this country, but in particular, again, the sort of dire circumstances of these women who are facing the most brutal mass rapes, is really just—it leaves me speechless.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you so much for being with us. Last question. You were sitting right behind Nadia Murad at the U.N. Security Council hearing. The Murad rule that the U.K. is expected to launch, the Murad Code?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : The U.K. has been a real leader in efforts to raise attention and awareness to the issue of sexual violence in conflict and to come up with various codes of conduct and remedial mechanisms. So, I think that effort will be continuing. There’s a big conference later this year.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, we will certainly cover that. Jessica Neuwirth, I want to thank you for being with us, director of the Human Rights Program at Roosevelt House, Hunter College, also the director of Sisterhood Is Global Institute, and sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo protesting the U.S. stance on the Security Council resolution on sexual violence in conflict. Jessica Neuwirth has worked as a consultant to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on issues of sexual violence in several cases. I want to thank you so much for being with us.
When we come back, we’re going to get response from Dr. Leana Wen, who is the new president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and also talk with her about the Title X rulings that have come down this week. We’ll talk about the gag rule and the global gag rule. Stay with us.
[break]
AMY GOODMAN : “Blackbird” by Nina Simone. This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, as we turn to the new president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Dr. Leana Wen. She was just honored by Time magazine this week as one of Time 100, the most influential people of 2019.
Before we talk about Title X, I wanted to get your response, Dr. Wen, to what just took place at the U.N. Security Council, a resolution that was passed 13 to 0 on sexual violence against women, rape against people in war zones, but the U.S. gutting that resolution, taking out any reference to sexual and reproductive health.
DR. LEANA WEN : I have treated women who were infected with HIV as a result of rape during the war. I’ve helped women who were the victims of sexual torture, with clubs and bayonets, and had fistulas and required lifesaving support. What we need to do for these women who are victims of war and horrific situations is to provide them with the care that they need. And excluding sexual and reproductive healthcare undermines their ability to get that care.
It’s time for us, as the U.S., to value women’s rights as human rights. And what this Trump-Pence administration has consistently shown, globally and in the U.S., is that they do not value women’s lives. And the policies that they are championing are, frankly, oppressive. They counter best practices when it comes to public health. And frankly, they are misogynistic.

In Sri Lanka, government officials have lowered the death toll from the Easter Sunday attacks on churches and hotels to about 253. That’s more than 100 lower than the previous estimate. Authorities said there were so many body parts at the bombing sites it was difficult to obtain a precise death toll. More than 500 people were injured. Over the past day, Sri Lanka’s top police official and defense secretary have both resigned in response to the government’s failure to follow up on warnings that an attack was imminent. Anita Hill: I Am Not Satisfied by Biden’s Apology over Handling of Clarence Thomas Allegations Apr 26, 2019 Image Credit: Facebook: @ProfAnitaHill
Former Vice President Joe Biden recently reached out to Anita Hill prior to entering the presidential race. Biden has long been criticized for his handling of Hill’s allegations that now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her in the workplace. Biden was chair of the all-male, all-white Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 when Hill testified. He forced Hill to discuss in graphic detail Thomas’s sexual comments, and he did not invite other women to testify who could have corroborated Hill’s allegations. Anita Hill told The New York Times she was not satisfied with Biden’s comments during their phone conversation. Hill said, “I cannot be satisfied by simply saying, ’I’m sorry for what happened to you.’ I will be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose.” Topics: As Comcast Lobbyist Hosts Biden’s First Fundraiser, Campaign Boasts of Support from “Top 1%” Apr 26, 2019
In other campaign news, Biden marked his first day on the campaign trail by attending a $2,800-per-person fundraiser in Philadelphia at the home of Comcast’s top lobbyist, David Cohen. Attendees included Daniel Hilferty, chief executive of Independence Blue Cross, the largest health insurer in the Philadelphia area. Senator Bernie Sanders criticized Biden for holding a fundraiser in the home of a corporate lobbyist. Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who co-hosted the Biden fundraiser, appeared on CNN this morning, and said the fundraiser attracted the top 1%.
Ed Rendell : “For 90% of the people who attended last night’s fundraiser, they’re contributing against their own financial interest. They will do better with a Republican president, because they’re in the top 1%. So they’ll do better with a Republican president. It will probably cost them money if Joe Biden wins, because I think he’ll bring some sense to the tax cut and he’ll probably raise rates on the top 1%. So, all these people gave money even though it was against their own financial interest.” Topics: Biden Hires Ex-Bernie Sanders Staffer as Senior Adviser Apr 26, 2019 Image Credit: Gage Skidmore
In other campaign news, Biden has hired Symone Sanders to be a senior adviser to his campaign. Sanders is a prominent African-American political strategist who served as press secretary for Bernie Sanders’ presidential run in 2016. Last month, Symone Sanders donated $250 to the campaign of Pete Buttigieg. Topics: Hundreds of Thousands Protest in Sudan Demanding Civilian Rule Apr 26, 2019
In Sudan, hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered outside Sudan’s Defense Ministry Thursday calling for civilian rule following the recent military coup that ousted Omar al-Bashir. About 100 Sudanese judges joined the protests, chanting, “Civilian, civilian, protected by the judiciary.” In a concession to the protesters, three prominent Sudanese generals have agreed to resign from the ruling Transitional Military Council. Protesters are vowing to stay in the streets until military rule has ended.
Awad al-Bashir : “All of our demands have been carefully studied, are well known, and we insist on them. We will not leave this sit-in until all our demands are met, at the forefront of which is a civilian government.” Topics: North Korea’s Kim Jong-un Accuses U.S. of Acting in Bad Faith in Nuke Talks Apr 26, 2019
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has wrapped up his first-ever meeting with President Vladimir Putin. Kim criticized the United States for acting in bad faith during his recent nuclear summit with Trump and warned that the situation on the Korean Peninsula could return to what he described as its “original state.” On Thursday, Putin said the international community—not just the United States—should be involved in negotiations on North Korea’s nuclear program. Topics: In Response to Yellow Vest Protests, Macron Vows to Cut Taxes, Tells Nation It Must Work Harder Apr 26, 2019
French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to cut taxes and increase pensions as part of a package of reforms aimed at quelling the 6-month-old yellow vest protests. Macron outlined his proposals in an over two-hour press conference in which he also told French workers they must work harder. Topics: Report: U.S. Sanctions Have Killed 40,000 in Venezuela Since 2017 Apr 26, 2019
More than 40,000 people have died in Venezuela since 2017 as a result of U.S. sanctions. That’s the conclusion of a new report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the economist Jeffrey Sachs. The report examines how U.S. sanctions have reduced the availability of food and medicine in Venezuela and increased disease and mortality. Jeffrey Sachs said, “American sanctions are deliberately aiming to wreck Venezuela’s economy and thereby lead to regime change. It’s a fruitless, heartless, illegal, and failed policy, causing grave harm to the Venezuelan people.” Topics: Second Judge Blocks Trump’s Title X “Gag Rule” on Abortion Apr 26, 2019
In the second time this week, a federal judge has blocked a new rule that would have stripped federal funding known as Title X for Planned Parenthood and other clinics that refer patients for abortions or even mention abortion as an option. U.S. District Judge Stanley Bastian of Washington state ruled against the changes on Thursday, saying they would require clinics “to face a Hobson’s choice that harms patients as well as the providers.” The judge’s ruling halts the so-called gag rule, which was announced by President Trump in February and was scheduled to go into effect on May 3. This came two days after an Oregon judge issued a preliminary injunction to stop the gag order from going into effect. Topics:"

"Despite Two Recent Arrests, Filipina Journalist Maria Ressa Continues to Speak Out for Press Freedom | Democracy Now!",www.democracynow.org,,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/26/despite_two_recent_arrests_filipina_journalist,"founder, CEO and executive editor of Rappler, an acclaimed Philippine news website. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, with Part 2 of our interview with Maria Ressa. She’s the founder, CEO and executive editor of Rappler, the acclaimed Philippines news website. Maria Ressa has been arrested twice in recent months by the Philippines government, as President Duterte cracks down on critics and the media. In February, she was detained in a cyber libel case that’s widely seen as politically motivated. She was arrested again in late March for allegedly violating a ban on foreign media ownership. She’s here in New York City after being named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people of 2019, joining us now for Part 2 of our discussion.
Can you talk about the “matrix,” Maria?
MARIA RESSA : I wish it was a movie. Just this week, it looks like, we’ve escalated fantasyland, right? But the presidential palace—so, it was first seeded as a story in a pro-government newspaper, that’s run by the head of international public relations for President Duterte. It alleges that a group of independent news sites, including Rappler and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, which was founded by Sheila Coronel, who is now a dean at Columbia Journalism School here—that Sheila and I and others, who are independent journalists, are plotting to oust President Duterte, as in coup plotters, right?
They released a “matrix.” They’re calling it the “matrix,” but a very crude link analysis—expensive software that tries to make fantasy look like a reality. We reacted very quickly. It’s just—it’s fantasy. And everyone else—the focus of this was Ellen Tordesillas, who runs Vera Files, also another accredited fact-checker by Facebook in the Philippines. It’s a concerted attack. When government says something, regardless if it’s a blatant lie, people listen to it. And so, this opens up a whole new can of worms. You know, the—
AMY GOODMAN : And you, of course—you and Rappler, again, are on this list.
MARIA RESSA : Yes. I’m still there, along with some of our board directors. It looks like someone just took a list of the directors of Rappler and plastered it onto this matrix. The problem is that they’ve already seeded things like the Department of Justice saying, no, they won’t file cases. Who asked them whether they should file cases? And then the Philippine National Police has said that they’re going to proactively investigate the journalists and the people named on this fantasy list. It’s like inception, you know? And I guess that makes me both angry and embarrassed for the Philippine government.
AMY GOODMAN : And, of course, I mean, in naming all these journalists and journalistic organizations, with Duterte calling reporters who ask him tough questions “spies,” and, again, saying, “Just because you’re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination,” it’s like a hit list.
MARIA RESSA : You can see it all converging. Correct. So, this is kind of—the drug war, President Duterte released a narco list—right?—his list of people in the drug war. Very quickly, journalists pointed out that some of the people named in that list, A, are dead, B, are not where they’re supposed to be. It’s very easy to fact-check this matrix and show that it isn’t true. But there are already repercussions, when the police begin to investigate you. I mean, why would they even investigate? There isn’t any evidence. But this is how things are set in motion.
AMY GOODMAN : This is President Duterte speaking to your news organization, Rappler, in October of 2015, when he was the mayor of Davao City, before he was president. He’d been accused of running death squads.
MAYOR RODRIGO DUTERTE : I must admit that I have killed. Three months early on, I killed about three people.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s, at the time, Mayor Duterte—
MARIA RESSA : Correct.
AMY GOODMAN : —now president, talking to you—
MARIA RESSA : Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : —boasting about killing three people.
MARIA RESSA : This was in October of 2015.
AMY GOODMAN : You think this helped get him elected president?
MARIA RESSA : Sadly, I believe so. And looking back on it, you know, I asked the tough questions, but I didn’t drill. And I think one of the most interesting things in that is partly because he was refreshing. He admitted. Who admits to you on camera that they killed people, right?
But then, beyond that, let’s take a look at what the propaganda machine has done. President Duterte faced human rights charges of—it’s something called DDS , that he ran the Davao Death Squad. After the propaganda machine kicked into motion, DDS had a new meaning, because they just astroturfed it. It became Duterte Diehard Supporters. And I guess that goes to how all these attacks continue. Because they control the pipeline of information and they use social media effectively, they’re able to turn white to green, and something that was a negative has now become a positive.
AMY GOODMAN : So, talk about the recent decision of the Philippines’ highest court ordering Duterte, the government, to release documents relating to thousands of deaths linked to his so-called war on drugs.
MARIA RESSA : The executive office has kind of pushed back. Every time the government or journalists have asked for any kind of documentation in this war on drugs, where tens of thousands—27,000, according to the U.N.'s latest estimate—have been killed since July 2016. So the Supreme Court recently ruled that they would need to release the documents. And we've seen the first group. And what it’s shown is that there is incomplete records, that the criminal cases have not been filed and that more needs to get done. But that’s a minor victory, right?
And that’s part of the reason, shortly before that decision, Rappler decided to go to the Supreme Court on a press freedom issue. And I hope that other Filipino journalists are going to be joining this case. It’s a case that Rappler has been banned from coverage of the presidential palace for 14 months now.
AMY GOODMAN : What do you mean?
MARIA RESSA : President Duterte, literally, when he didn’t like a corruption story we had—it alleged corruption against his aide, who is now running for the Senate—he just unilaterally banned our reporter. So she walked into the palace, and the guard prevented her from coming in. There was confusion, no written order, but we were banned from the palace. Then, in succeeding months, we were banned from any event, even if it’s private, anywhere in the Philippines where President Duterte speaks. And what really triggered our case was when there was a campaign rally and President Duterte was speaking, and they threw our reporter out. So, we came in. We filed this case three weeks ago with the Supreme Court, hoping that they will pick it up. And it looks like at least the journalism community in the Philippines will come and support it. So, that’s a good thing. But these are small. These are small efforts to try to hold the government to account.
AMY GOODMAN : So, let’s talk about the devastation in the Philippines from the war on drugs. Rappler has helped expose Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte’s deadly war on drugs, including in a video series titled Impunity . This video was titled “Alias Heart.” Heart de Chavez was allegedly murdered by the Philippine National Police January 10, 2017. This clip includes police officer Captain Edwin Fuggan [ sic ], Heart’s sister Arriane and Heart’s mother Elena.
ELENA DE CHAVEZ : [translated] I held her against my chest. That was why my clothes were covered in blood. When I saw her, there was a hole in her face, here.
ARRIANE DE CHAVEZ : [translated] Somebody there said that before Heart was brought into the house where she was shot, they kicked her first. They broke her arm.
ELENA DE CHAVEZ : [translated] That wasn’t just it. They shot my daughter four times.
ARRIANE DE CHAVEZ : [translated] When you’re a rich person, you’re treated like a VIP , but when you’re a poor person, the treatment is RIP .
ELENA DE CHAVEZ : [translated] I know it was the cops who killed her.
CHIEF DANTE NOVICIO : There is no evidence the police did the killing, because the alleged suspects were wearing bonnets, so it’s hard. It’s hard to say.
ARRIANE DE CHAVEZ : [translated] I can identify those who killed my sister as cops.
CHIEF DANTE NOVICIO : The police do not go into homes to kill people. We do have police operations when police do end up killing, so they’ve developed a mindset that it’s the police who killed.
INTERVIEWER : [translated] Do you have plans to file a case?
ELENA DE CHAVEZ : [translated] How can I file a case? Who will I file against? Even if I wanted to, who will I file a case against? Duterte? That he ordered the killings?
AMY GOODMAN : That piece from the Rappler Impunity series. What has happened in that case, the killing in 2017?
MARIA RESSA : Everything is open. You know, there are so many mothers who have lost children. One case had a 5-year-old killed. And there is no sense of justice. And I think that’s what we’re trying to go back to. When the state begins to act like a criminal, when there is no accountability, when people are dying at this rate, there’s something fundamentally wrong. And part of what we’re also trying to remind Filipinos is that we shouldn’t accept this. This shouldn’t become normal.
AMY GOODMAN : So, you’re heading back to the Philippines tonight. Are you afraid?
MARIA RESSA : I think I’m trying to be prepared. You know, when I come out and when I landed in New York, it’s like I don’t realize how heavy the air has become, and when I get here, it’s like—you know, I take a deep breath: “The air is clean! Oh my god! This is what freedom feels like!”
AMY GOODMAN : Well, not quite.
MARIA RESSA : Well, literally, yes, but compared to… And then, now that I’m getting ready—you know, last night, I just started getting mentally prepared. I’m looking forward to seeing my team, who’s doing good work. We’re in the last few weeks of a critical election. If we lose an independent Senate, we could lose our democracy. There is a lot at stake in these elections. And I’m not so sure Filipinos are aware of that, right? So, I’m getting ready. I am energized. We’re going back to battle.
AMY GOODMAN : This is from The New York Times , talking about the elections that are happening on May 13th. “President [Rodrigo] Duterte has publicly released a new list of people [that] he claims are 'narcopoliticians,'”—
MARIA RESSA : Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : —”vowing his remaining three years in office will be the bloodiest yet in his war on drugs. The list … [including] the names of 46 officials—33 mayors, eight deputy mayors, one ex-mayor, a provincial board member and three members of Congress. In the past, many of those who were listed ended up dead at the hands of police[men] or vigilantes.”
MARIA RESSA : That’s what we’re fighting. Who vets this list? You know, how do you get on this list, especially the first list that we saw? There were dead people already on the list, right? There were vendetta—people who get on there because the people who had power to put them on could. This is extrajudicial, and in the same way that journalists were listed without evidence. We need to demand evidence. We need to hold the executive to account for this. And having said that, what’s the point of this, right? It’s to control power. It sows fear. It makes people afraid to ask and to speak; otherwise, they could be included.
AMY GOODMAN : So, you’ve been arrested twice, jailed once. How much have you had to pay in bond or bail?
MARIA RESSA : Rappler has had to pay more than the entire Marcos family.
AMY GOODMAN : Now, Marcos, the former dictator.
MARIA RESSA : The former dictator.
AMY GOODMAN : And Imelda Marcos, of course, still alive.
MARIA RESSA : Imelda Marcos, who’s been convicted, right? They are convicted. And yet, here we are.
AMY GOODMAN : And she’s out on bail.
MARIA RESSA : She’s never been arrested. And—
AMY GOODMAN : But she’s had to pay something.
MARIA RESSA : Like a fraction of what I’ve had to pay.
AMY GOODMAN : And tell us what she’s been convicted of.
MARIA RESSA : The worst. I mean, the family has siphoned. She has a slew of cases in four different countries, siphoning money away from—
AMY GOODMAN : About how much?
MARIA RESSA : The big number that was thrown at the Marcoses at the very beginning is $10 billion. That is huge.
AMY GOODMAN : And you’ve had to pay more than Imelda Marcos.
MARIA RESSA : I’m very special. And this is why this special treatment, this weaponization of the law—you know, I appeal to the Filipino—the men and women in the judiciary. You have to fight this individual battle for integrity, because we need to maintain the spirit of our constitution. We cannot give it up without a fight.
AMY GOODMAN : Maria Ressa, you go back and forth between the United States and the Philippines. Can you talk about a comparison between Presidents Duterte and Trump?
MARIA RESSA : I think that, you know, the Philippines is a cautionary tale for the United States. What shocked me is how fast things can change. And I think Americans need to be aware that the things that you think have been there for a very long time, it can turn on a dime. And in within six months in the Philippines, all of a sudden it’s OK to kill. If you look at Cambridge Analytica, that scandal, the most number of compromised accounts are in the United States. The country with the second most number of compromised accounts is the Philippines. You can do a lot with the technology that is there. And if your leader is pushing top down, society can transform. Your institutions are still pushing back. But the same thing that I tell Filipinos: Now is the time to fight for your rights. If you do not fight for these rights, they can be taken away, and it can happen quickly.
AMY GOODMAN : May 13th is the elections. And talk about what’s at stake.
MARIA RESSA : There’s a lot at stake for the Philippines in the May 13th elections, because what stopped a change of government in the Philippines has been an independent Senate. The House bill actually already pushed forward and approved a new constitution.
AMY GOODMAN : You have two bodies in the Legislature, like ours.
MARIA RESSA : We’re very much like the United States. Our constitution is patterned after the U.S. Constitution. We have a bill of rights very similar to the U.S. Bill of Rights. We have a House of Representatives and a Senate. The House of Representatives already passed a new constitution, a draft. It didn’t go through the Senate. It was dead on arrival, right?
AMY GOODMAN : And that’s one that would support Duterte’s changes.
MARIA RESSA : Well, this was before. After May 13th, all of the surveys are showing that administration candidates could win the new Senate. And if that happens, it will be only a matter of time before we get a new constitution. It will be parliamentary. It will most likely be a federalist form of government. But forget the facade. The substance of it will fundamentally transform the democracy that we have, take away a lot of the bill of rights, put a lot of power in the hands of President Duterte to appoint a transitional committee. We will no longer be a democracy. Our justice system will be completely transformed. So, this—there’s a lot at stake.
AMY GOODMAN : In what way?
MARIA RESSA : If you’re Filipino, you’ve got to ensure that we retain an independent Senate. There must be checks and balances, regardless of how tiny it is.
AMY GOODMAN : Could the term of Duterte be extended?
MARIA RESSA : If the constitution is changed, everything can happen.
AMY GOODMAN : How long does he have now?
MARIA RESSA : Right now a Philippine president has a 6-year term and can only have one 6-year term. He’s halfway through his term. But if the constitution is changed, you know, all bets are off.
AMY GOODMAN : And when President Trump talks about fake media, when President Trump talks about the media as the enemy of the people, what are your thoughts?
MARIA RESSA : The same things. I mean, they’re the same type of leader—and this is what I said in the toast at Time 100—you know, even though they’re on near opposite sides of the world.
AMY GOODMAN : So, wait, let’s talk about this toast.
MARIA RESSA : Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : You were just awarded as one of 100—Time 100 most influential people in the world of 2019. You were one of five people chosen to give a toast. Among those in the audience was Jared Kushner—
MARIA RESSA : Jared Kushner, yes.
AMY GOODMAN : —the son-in-law and senior adviser to President Trump.
MARIA RESSA : Yes. And in the toast, I talked about how my sister and I, both born in the Philippines, made two different choices. She chose to make her home here in New York. And then I chose the Philippines. I chose Manila as my home, for better or worse, you know? And I talked about how, despite that, our leaders are identical in style—populist, authoritarian tendencies, sexist at best and misogynistic at worst—and how this is transforming not just the way governance works, but the very values that are the foundation of what our societies are made of, right? The values and the principles, I think that’s the part that we keep forgetting. This will have an impact on the next generation.
AMY GOODMAN : Could you see Jared Kushner as you were speaking?
MARIA RESSA : I couldn’t. But Brian Stelter actually tweeted about it while while it was happening. I didn’t think about, you know—frankly, I’m just calling a spade a spade. You can see it in his—Jared Kushner can see that in President Trump’s words and his actions.
AMY GOODMAN : And what you’re saying to the American people about the moves that have to be made, you’re making me think about Yale historian Timothy Snyder’s book, On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century .
MARIA RESSA : On Tyranny , correct, right.
AMY GOODMAN : About shoring up institutions, responding very quickly, because things descend rapidly.
MARIA RESSA : You cannot be apathetic. You cannot think someone else will do it. Every one of us who cares about democracy, who cares about safeguarding our rights, jump in now, because the battle is now. You will see a quick erosion if you hold back. This is a collective responsibility. And this is the generation that will either win it or lose it.
AMY GOODMAN : What kind of resistance is there on the ground in the Philippines? What kind of pushback is there?
MARIA RESSA : Not much. It’s fragmented. In the Philippines, part of the problem is this—the information operations on social media is effective. We have a popular president, in the 80 percent approval ratings, compared to President Trump’s 30-plus, right? So, it’s—
AMY GOODMAN : Duterte.
MARIA RESSA : Duterte’s approval ratings are high. And again, I don’t know whether that’s reality or not—right?—because the astroturfing on Facebook works. And then the second one is, when you do these statistical surveys, they’re done in their homes, with the addresses on record. If you know that and you live in an area where law and order is weak or where martial law has been declared, would you really say you’re not for President Duterte? I mean, you know, so that’s why these elections are important.
Fear is a factor. You’ve seen that. You’ve talked—we’ve talked about the list, not just of people to be killed in the drug war, but journalists who are speaking up.
AMY GOODMAN : The “matrix.”
MARIA RESSA : The “matrix.” It’s another list, right? It’s a list of people to be targeted. It’s to sow fear. It’s not just about us. In fact, it’s probably not about me. It is about what that does to a society: “If you follow her and you speak out, you are going to be treated like this.” I go back, cautionary tale. This is a tried and tested method of the way President Duterte has ruled Davao City since 1988.
AMY GOODMAN : What in your background has given you this courage? Who are your role models?
MARIA RESSA : I come from different cultures. You know, my family left the Philippines when martial law was declared in the '70s. I grew up in New Jersey, in Toms River, New Jersey. And after I graduated college, I went to Princeton. And this is also ironic, because Imee Marcos, the daughter of Ferdinand Marcos, says that she graduated from Princeton. But Princeton says no. And then, when they congratulated me for the Time 100, then it became a big news in the Philippines again, right? Princeton now has a role in the Philippines. But I guess part of it—it's crazy! I feel like Alice in Wonderland, and the Mad Hatter is in charge. I just have to keep walking through, and I’m going to have faith that on the other side the world will be right-side up.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you so much for being with us. Safe travels back to the Philippines. Maria Ressa, founder, CEO , executive editor of Rappler, acclaimed Philippines news website. Maria Ressa has been arrested twice in recent months by the Philippines government, as Duterte cracks down on the media and all critics. In February, she was detained in one case that’s widely seen as politically motivated, arrested again in late March. We will continue to follow what she faces in the Philippines. She came here to New York to be honored as one of Time 100’s most influential people of 2019 and receive an award from Syracuse University’s journalism school. Each time she comes to the United States, it looks like, at this last point, she’s getting yet another journalism award. We only hope that protects her in the Philippines.

In other campaign news, Biden marked his first day on the campaign trail by attending a $2,800-per-person fundraiser in Philadelphia at the home of Comcast’s top lobbyist, David Cohen. Attendees included Daniel Hilferty, chief executive of Independence Blue Cross, the largest health insurer in the Philadelphia area. Senator Bernie Sanders criticized Biden for holding a fundraiser in the home of a corporate lobbyist. Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who co-hosted the Biden fundraiser, appeared on CNN this morning, and said the fundraiser attracted the top 1%.
Ed Rendell : “For 90% of the people who attended last night’s fundraiser, they’re contributing against their own financial interest. They will do better with a Republican president, because they’re in the top 1%. So they’ll do better with a Republican president. It will probably cost them money if Joe Biden wins, because I think he’ll bring some sense to the tax cut and he’ll probably raise rates on the top 1%. So, all these people gave money even though it was against their own financial interest.” Topics: 2020 Election The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

Former Vice President Joe Biden recently reached out to Anita Hill prior to entering the presidential race. Biden has long been criticized for his handling of Hill’s allegations that now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her in the workplace. Biden was chair of the all-male, all-white Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 when Hill testified. He forced Hill to discuss in graphic detail Thomas’s sexual comments, and he did not invite other women to testify who could have corroborated Hill’s allegations. Anita Hill told The New York Times she was not satisfied with Biden’s comments during their phone conversation. Hill said, “I cannot be satisfied by simply saying, ’I’m sorry for what happened to you.’ I will be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose.” Topics: 2020 Election The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

In Mozambique, at least five people were killed, and thousands more feared trapped, after the second major cyclone to hit southeastern Africa within weeks roared ashore as a Category 4 storm with winds of over 135 miles per hour. Cyclone Kenneth was the strongest storm ever to make landfall in Mozambique. Officials are warning the death toll is likely to rise, after the storm flattened whole villages, bringing heavy rains that left some towns in northern Mozambique cut off by raging floodwaters. Officials are warning of a looming humanitarian disaster in a region that’s still reeling from Cyclone Idai, which struck in March, leaving nearly 600 dead, while sparking a cholera epidemic and shortages of drinking water and food.

From LBJ to Robert Moses: Robert Caro on Writing About Political Power & Its Impact on the Powerless,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/29/from_lbj_to_robert_moses_robert,"Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York and The Years of Lyndon Johnson . His most recent best-selling book is titled Working . Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : We turn now to one of the nation’s most celebrated writers, the two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Robert Caro. He’s out with a new book titled Working , that gives an inside look at his remarkable research and writing process. And it does appear that Robert Caro is always working.
Forty-five years ago, he published his first book, The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York . Over a seven-year-period, he conducted over 500 interviews for what turned out to be a 1,200-page book looking at how Robert Moses reshaped the nation’s largest city, New York. The Modern Library would later name The Power Broker as one of the top 100 nonfiction books of the 20th century, along with such works as Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring and W.E.B. Du Bois’s The Souls of Black Folk .
And Caro hasn’t stopped working since. For the past 45 years, Robert Caro, with much help from his wife Ina, has been researching the life and times of President Lyndon Baines Johnson, from his childhood in Hill Country, Texas, to his time in the White House. Four volumes have been published so far: The Path to Power , Means of Ascent , Master of the Senate and The Passage of Power . They total more than 3,000 pages. Robert Caro is now writing the fifth volume, looking at Vietnam, the Great Society and President Johnson’s decision not to seek re-election in 1968.
Robert Caro has been described as “the greatest political biographer of our times” and “America’s biographer-in-chief.” But to reduce Caro’s work as simply biographies of great men misses the point. Caro uses both Moses and Johnson to show how political power works. Caro writes that by focusing on Robert Moses, he was able to explore, quote, “the realities of urban political power, power in cities, [power] not just in New York but in all the cities of America in the middle of the twentieth century.” With LBJ , Caro helped expose how national power works in the Senate and the presidency. Robert Caro once told Kurt Vonnegut, quote, “What I’m trying to do, is to show not only how power works but the effect of power on those without power. How political power affects all our lives, every single day in ways we never think about,” he says.
Well, with Democracy Now! co-host Juan González, who today is joining us from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, we’re spending the hour with Robert Caro.
Welcome to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us, Robert.
ROBERT CARO : Great to be with you.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to go back to 55 years ago. In fact, it would be 55 years ago in July that President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And go back a few months before that, when Lyndon Baines Johnson, standing next to a blood-spattered Jackie Kennedy, would be sworn in as president. He could have taken on any issue at that point, becoming president. Warned by many in his inner circle, “Don’t do the Civil Rights Act. Don’t lose the South,” he moved forward. Describe for us—set the stage and the place. Talk about LBJ’s decision to go this route.
ROBERT CARO : Four days after the assassination, he has to give an address to the joint session of Congress. He’s not even in the Oval Office yet. He’s still working out of his private home in Washington. Three or four of his speechwriters are sitting around the kitchen table trying to draft a speech. And at some point Johnson comes down wearing a bathrobe and asks them how they’re doing. They say, “Well, the only thing we’re all sure of is don’t make civil rights a priority. If you anger the Southerners who control Congress, they’re going to stop your whole legislative program, like they did Kennedy. It’s a noble cause, but it’s a lost cause. Don’t fight for it.” And Lyndon Johnson says to them, “Well, what the hell is the presidency for then?” And, of course, in his speech, he says, with all the Southern senators sitting in a row in front of him, “Our first priority has to be the passage of the civil rights bill.”
AMY GOODMAN : And talk about the battle that ensued? You particularly focus on Richard Russell, and you pit these two—well, they pitted themselves against each other.
ROBERT CARO : Well, Russell—you know, Johnson convinced the Southern senators—for 20 years before 1964, every vote that he made was on the side of the South. He not only supported every Southern bill and opposed every civil rights bill, but he was a Southern strategist. And Russell took him under his wing. Richard Russell was the most powerful figure in the Senate. He was the head of the mighty Southern Caucus. You have to understand, Amy, in that year—I forget the—I may have the numbers wrong here, but approximately right—of the 16 great standing committees in the Senate, 11 were chaired by Southerners or their allies. They had all the power in the Senate. And Russell raised Lyndon Johnson up to the position of majority leader. It was him who really put Johnson in.
So, I would speak to some of the Southern senators. And I asked one of them—I remember Herman Talmadge, who was actually dying when I finally got to talk to him. He was the senator from Georgia. Finally talked to me, and I’m asking him about this, and I said, “Well, what did Lyndon Johnson convince you should be the relationship between white men and black men? What did he believe?” Talmage said, “Master and servant.” And I said, “So how did he make you believe that?” And Talmadge, who was a sharp man and proud of his sharpness, said, “He talked to me all the time. I thought we were friends. I thought I knew what he really believed.” So I said, “Well, how did you feel when Johnson gave the speech saying our first priority must be the civil rights bill? How did you feel sitting there as he stands there saying this?” Talmadge said—there was this long pause—finally, he says to me, “Sick. I felt sick.”
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Robert Caro, what then changed Johnson and made him such a proponent of the civil rights movement?
ROBERT CARO : Well, I’m not sure that anything changed Johnson. You see, it may be that he believed the same thing all along, but he concealed it for 20 years. You know, why do I think Lyndon Johnson truly believed in civil rights, that it wasn’t a political thing? Because when he was 20 and 21 years old, he went to college; it was a college he called the poor boys’ school. He didn’t have enough money to continue. He had to drop out between his sophomore and junior year and teach school. And he taught in a school in a little town down near the Mexican border in Texas, in what they called “the Mexican school.” I wrote about that. No teacher had ever cared if these kids learned or not. This teacher cared. He was so insistent that they learn English—he thought that was the crucial thing—if, at recess, he heard boys shouting in excitement on the baseball diamond in Spanish, he’d run out and spank them on the spot. Girls, he gave a tongue lashing to.
Now, all this time later, he has concealed this. Now he becomes president. He has the power. You know, we all learn Lord Acton’s axiom, “All power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.” I’m not sure that, as a result of my work, I believe that. What I really believe, I believe that power does not always corrupt. Sometimes power cleanses. But what power always does is reveal. When you get enough power so you can do what you want, then people see what you wanted to do all along.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, you know, I was interested in your new book, Working , and obviously some of the stuff that you have in here is a distillation not only of what you learned in the bigger books that you wrote but also the process by which you learned them. You talk about the rise of power of Lyndon Johnson, and you center on this moment in October of 1940, when it appeared to be that Johnson really, as a young member of Congress, begins to gain much more influence and power. And you were fascinated to try to understand what had happened in October of 1940 to suddenly catapult Johnson into a key figure. And you end up discovering this whole connection that he developed to the oil barons of Texas and the funding of the Democratic Party. I’m wondering if you could talk about that?
ROBERT CARO : Yes, it was quite—you see, he’s been in Congress only three years. He’s 32 years old. He has no power. And then, all of a sudden, after the month of October 1940, just before the election, he’s the guy, you see in the files, senior congressmen asking for five minutes of his time. So I said, “What happened during that five months?” At that time I was talking to a notable Washington fixer, a very ebullient wheeler-dealer in Washington for decades, named Tommy the Cork. He used to call me “kid.” So, I said, “What happened in October 1940?” I remember Corcoran said to me, “Money, kid. Money. But you’re never going to be able to write about that, kid.” And I said, “Why not?” He said, “Because Lyndon Johnson never put anything in writing.”
Well, Corcoran was only partly right: Johnson hardly ever put anything in writing. But as I’m going through the papers in the Johnson Library, there are two amazing documents. One is a telegram from Brown & Root, the huge Texas oil contracting and dam building firm for whom Johnson is getting a federal contract, saying to Lyndon Johnson at the beginning of October 1940, “Lyndon, the checks are on the way.” And the money that is being sent to him—unprecedented amounts of money—is for him to distribute to congressmen, because Lyndon Johnson is a genius. He doesn’t have any power, but he realizes there is one thing he has that no other congressman has. He knows two groups of people. He knows the Texas oilmen and contractors who need favors from the federal government, and he needs—and are willing to pay to get it, to give campaign contributions, and he knows the Northeastern, Northern liberal congressmen who need money for their campaigns. He arranges that all this money be given through him, and that creates power.
And there is a list that I found in the Johnson Library that was just remarkable. You know, we wonder: How do you prove that economic power has such an effect on political power, that economic power creates political power sometimes? You see it all in this list. The list is typed by one of Johnson’s secretaries. There are two typed columns. In the left column is the name of the congressman who’s asking for money. In the center column is how much money he’s asking for—small amounts, tiny amounts by our standards: “Lyndon, need $450 for poll watchers,”“Lyndon, $700 will give me a round of last-minute advertising.” But in the left-hand column—left-hand margin, next to the congressman’s name, there is, by each name, something in Johnson’s handwriting. Sometimes he writes—if he’s giving the congressman all the money the guy has asked for, he writes, “OK.” Sometimes, if he’s giving him part of it, he writes, “OK,” and the amount: “OK, 300,”“OK, 500.” But sometimes he writes, “None.” He’s not giving him anything. And sometimes he writes, “None, out.” And I asked his longtime assistant John Connally, “What did it mean when Lyndon Johnson wrote, 'None, out'?” And Connally said to me—I’ll never forget his tone—he said, “That guy was never going to get money from Lyndon Johnson. Lyndon Johnson never forgave, and he never forgot.”
AMY GOODMAN : We’re talking to Robert Caro, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of two books, The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York and The Years of Lyndon Johnson . His most recent best-selling book is titled Working . We’re speaking with Robert Caro for the hour. Stay with us.

AMY GOODMAN : “We Shall Overcome,” live recording of the late folk legend Pete Seeger singing at Carnegie Hall in 1963. Pete Seeger was born 100 years ago this Friday, May 3rd, 1919. This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González, who’s joining us from Rutgers University in New Jersey, where he teaches. Our guest for the hour is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Caro, won the prizes for two books, one on Robert Moses, one on President Johnson, though he’s actually written four on President Johnson and writing a fifth, and now has a new book out called Working . As we listened to that break, Pete Seeger singing “We Shall Overcome,” talk about Lyndon Johnson hearing that song outside the White House.
ROBERT CARO : He’s hearing it. You know, in those days, we had Martin Luther King marching in Selma. The marchers, the pickets, the civil rights movement believed Lyndon Johnson wasn’t fully on their side. They heard his Southern accent. They are singing it on Pennsylvania Avenue outside the White—you can hear it, you know, in the family dining room at the White House. On the night that he goes to Congress to deliver his speech on the Voting Rights Act, as the car turns out of the White House onto Pennsylvania Avenue, the pickets are there, just pressing almost up to the car. And among the things they’re chanting, “Hey, hey, LBJ , just you wait, see what happens in ’68.” And they’re singing “We Shall Overcome.” Johnson is sitting in the back of the car. Three aides are facing him. He doesn’t even look up. He’s turning the pages. But I asked one of the aides, who knew Johnson; I said, “Did he hear them?” He said, “He heard.”
He goes to Congress and gives this speech in which he adopts the key line, the anthem of the civil rights movement, “We shall overcome,” as “our” anthem. He says, “It’s not just Negroes who have to overcome. We have to overcome our prejudice. And we shall overcome.” When Johnson’s car comes back to the White House, I wrote, the pickets were gone.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to an audio recording of a phone call between President Lyndon Johnson and the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. This is from January 15, 1965, as they’re discussing the Voting Rights Act, that would be—Johnson would sign off on.
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON : Then we’ve got to come up with the qualification of voters. That will answer 70% of your problems.
REV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: That’s right.
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON : If you just cleared out everywhere, make it age and read and write. No tests on what Chaucer said or Browning’s poetry or constitutions or memorizing or anything else.
REV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Yes.
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON : And then you may have to put them in the post office, let the postmaster—that’s a federal employee that I control, who they can say is local, he’s recommended by the congressman, he’s approved by the senator. But if he doesn’t register everybody, I can put a new one in.
REV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Yes.
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON : And it’s not an outside Washington influence; it’s a local man. But they can just all go to the post office like they buy a stamp. Now, I haven’t thought this through, but that’s—that’s my general feeling. And I’ve talked to the attorney general, and I’ve got them working on it. I don’t want to start off with that, any more than I do with 14-B, because I wouldn’t get anything else.
REV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Yes, yes, yes.
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON : Do you—and I don’t want to publicize it. But I wanted to—that’s—I wanted you to know the outline of what I had in mind.
REV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Yes. Well, I remembered you mentioned it to me the other day at the White House. And I have been very diligent about making this statement.
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON : Well, your statement was perfect about the vote’s important, very important. And I think it’s good to talk about that. And I just don’t see how anybody can say that a man can fight in Vietnam but he can’t vote in the post office.
REV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : That was, by the way, that conversation, 1965, was on Dr. King’s birthday at the time. The Voting Rights Act would be signed August 6, 1965. That was Johnson speaking to Dr. Martin Luther King. And I wanted you to comment on their relationship. I once was speaking to Harry Belafonte and said, “When you get on in years and can’t remember your almost daily conversations with Dr. King, you can just apply under the Freedom of Information Act to the FBI to get the transcripts of all the conversations you had.” Robert Kennedy, Johnson’s attorney general, had King wiretapped. Talk about that relationship and what Lyndon Baines Johnson did in signing both the Civil Rights Act and, one year later, the Voting Rights Act.
ROBERT CARO : Well, you know, in the tape you just played, the most significant line was the first two lines that Johnson said. He says, basically, “If you make it easier for Negroes to register, 70% of your problem is solved.” Johnson believed that if they, black people, were given the right to vote, they could take care of a lot themselves. They would start electing their own officials. They would start to change America. So he’s saying to King, “The thing that I’m concentrating on is that you can register just as easy as going into a post office. If we give them the power to vote, they’ll have the power they need.”
You know, Martin Luther King, for a long time, didn’t trust Lyndon Johnson. You know, he didn’t fully—he didn’t believe he fully believed it. When Johnson gives his speech and says, “We shall overcome,” Martin Luther King is down in Selma. He’s listening to it on television in the living room of one of his supporters. And when Johnson says, “And we shall overcome,” they turn around and look at Dr. King, and it’s the only time, they say, they ever saw him cry.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Robert Caro, to go back to your approach to writing and researching, especially in this age when everyone or most of the young people get their information and their news from Twitter and Facebook posts and relatively short articles that they might read online, you actually moved with your wife to Texas to be able to really get into the subject matter of LBJ and his role in history and where he came from. Could you talk about your approach to spending years, often, just writing one book?
ROBERT CARO : Well, on the research—you know, I write pretty fast, although no one believes that. It’s the research that takes the time. The particular thing you’re talking about, moving to the Hill Country, I thought we wouldn’t have to do that. There were already, as I recall, seven biographies published. They all had chapters on his youth that depicted him a certain way. But I’m trying to get a little more detail, just so I can write better couple of chapters myself. And I realize I’m talking—the people in the Hill Country then, it was a land of such loneliness, such poverty, that’s, for me, coming from New York—I said to Ina, “You know, I’m not understanding these people. I’m not understanding their mores. I’m not understanding this country, the Hill Country. And therefore, I’m not understanding Lyndon Johnson, because this is what he came out of and shaped.” So, I said, “We’re going to have to move down there and get to know these people.” Ina, who loves Paris, who writes books on French history herself, said, “Why can’t you do a biography of Napoleon?” But we moved down there.
You know, interestingly, when you talk about why it’s hard to get these people to talk to you, they mistrusted journalists, because when Johnson was president, journalists would come down for three or four days, or maybe even a week, and go back and write these series of articles on what the Hill Country was really like. I’ll tell you what the Hill Country was like. You’d go to interview some person who was alive who knew Lyndon Johnson in high school, now is old. And the directions would be something like: You drive out of Austin for 47 miles; you watch for the cattle guard on your left; you turn left there, and you go on this rutted, unpaved road for like 30 miles; at the end of it is a house with a person with the information you need. You say, “I haven’t passed a house for 30 miles. Who does this person talk to? Does she have any friends?” It’s a different—they’re very wary of strangers. And I wasn’t getting people to talk to me at all. So, as soon as we moved down there, as it happens, as soon as they realized someone had come to stay, in trying to understand them, they would tell me what Lyndon Johnson was really like as a young man, which was very different from anything that had been depicted before.
AMY GOODMAN : You talked about moving there with Ina, your wife.
ROBERT CARO : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to talk about her role—
ROBERT CARO : Sure.
AMY GOODMAN : —which you have extolled, her role in your work. I mean, everything from, when you moved to Hill Country, how she gets to befriend this taciturn woman who was an important source for you, turning up with homemade fig jam she made herself, that opens up the people to speak. But it’s more than the jam. It is the research. It is your trusted fellow researcher, partner in all of this.
ROBERT CARO : Yes. You know, Ina is the only—you know, you look at other biographies, and at the end, in the acknowledgments, they might name three or four, or more, researchers who helped them. I found that there’s only one person besides myself that I’ve ever been able to trust to do my research, and it’s Ina. She is a wonderful researcher. She is also a historian in her own right. You know, in her high school yearbook, says her ambition is to be historical researcher. So, we’ve spent a lot of months and even years of our lives in the Lyndon Johnson Library going through papers.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re going to break for a moment, and then we’re going to come back to continue this discussion and also talk about Robert Moses—
ROBERT CARO : OK.
AMY GOODMAN : —the man who you wrote the book about, The Power Broker . Robert Caro, the twice Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York and The Years of Lyndon Johnson ; his most recent best-selling book, Working . This is Democracy Now! Back in a minute.
[break]
AMY GOODMAN : “Waist Deep in the Big Muddy,” Pete Seeger singing live on the CBS show The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in 1967. The song was initially censored from the original broadcast, but then, under enormous pressure, CBS gave in. This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . We’re spending the hour with the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Caro, who’s out with a new book called Working: Researching, Interviewing, Writing . He won the Pulitzer Prize for the Master of the Senate , about Lyndon Johnson, and, before that, he wrote—he won the prize for The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York . I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Robert Caro, I’d like to turn to The Power Broker . I’ve often said over the years to all of my friends in journalism, as well as the students I’ve taught, that you really cannot understand modern urban America without having read The Power Broker . It is really the Moby-Dick of nonfiction writing in America in terms of its epic approach and analysis of how power is wielded and how cities are shaped. Could you talk about how you first decided to write about Robert Moses, perhaps the most powerful unelected official, never elected to any office, in the history—in the modern history of New York, and really had influence in cities across the country?
ROBERT CARO : Well, I was a reporter for Newsday , an investigative reporter. So, I had won a number of minor, really minor—believe me, really minor—journalistic awards. But when you’re young and you win anything, you think you know everything about, and I thought I really understood political power.
Robert Moses wanted to build this bridge from Rye to Oyster Bay. You know, he built these bridges across Long Island Sound. He built the Triborough, the Bronx-Whitestone, the Throgs Neck. Now he wants to build the Rye-Oyster Bay Bridge. Newsday assigns me—I was then, whatever, 24, 25—to look into it. And I discover it’s this really terrible idea. It would have generated so much traffic, the Long Island Expressway would have needed 12 more lanes just to hold the cars, and the piers of this bridge would have had to be so big that they would have caused tidal pollution in Long Island Sound. I went up to Albany. I saw the governor, Nelson Rockefeller, his council, the assembly speaker, the president of the state Senate. Everybody understood this was a terrible idea. I write this story saying the idea is dead. I go on to something else.
About two weeks later—I have a friend in Albany—he calls me, and he says, “Bob, you ought to come back up here. Robert Moses was here yesterday.” So I said, “Oh, I don’t think so. I think I took care of that bridge.” He says, “Well, Robert Moses was up here yesterday. I think you ought to come back.” I come back. I speak to the same people—the governor, the assembly speaker, etc. They all think this is now the greatest idea in the world, and, in fact, the state is going to pay for the initial stages of it.
And I’m driving back to Long Island, and I remember it was 163 miles. And I’m thinking, “You know, you think you know what political power is. You don’t have the faintest idea what it is. You think you’re in a democracy, and political power comes from being elected from the votes that people cast at the ballot box. Here’s a guy who was never been elected to anything, and he had more power than anyone who was, more power than any mayor, more power than any governor, more power than any mayor and governor combined. And he held his power for 44 years. And with hit, he shaped all New York City. And you, Robert Caro, don’t have any idea where this power comes from.” And I also realized, neither does anybody else. That’s when I decided to do The Power Broker .
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, in Working , you talk about also the impact that Moses had on the neighborhoods of the city—
ROBERT CARO : Yeah.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: —and really redesigning many of New York City’s neighborhoods. And you say at one point, “He shaped the city physically not only by what he built but by what he destroyed. To build his expressways, he evicted from their homes 250,000 persons, in the process ripping out the centers of a score of neighborhoods, many of them friendly, vibrant communities that had made the city a home to its people. To build his non-highway public works, he evicted perhaps 250,000 more.” Perhaps half a million people were displaced by the public works of Robert Moses.
ROBERT CARO : Yes.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, of course, many people don’t think about the impact. The destruction of communities in the ’50s and ’60s then led to the rise of crime in the ’70s and ’80s in many of these same neighborhoods.
ROBERT CARO : Well, you know, what you’re talking about is when I decided that my books had to be different than what I thought they would be at the beginning. I came to realize that if I wanted to write about political power the way I wanted to write about it, I would have to show the effect of power not just on those who wield power, but on those on whom it’s wielded, on the powerless; show what government can do for people, for good, but also to people, for not good.
And what I did was I decided to take one mile of the 627 miles of expressways and parkways that Robert Moses built, and show the human cost of that one mile—to do that, I think he had evicted 15,000 people for this one mile; it’s a mile of the Cross Bronx Expressway in a neighborhood called East Tremont—and find the people who had lived there before. Now, before, this was a lower-middle-class community, largely Jewish, but a lot of Irish and German in there. These people were not well-off, but as long as they had a community and neighborhood where they knew had all their friends and neighbors, they had something. I had to find them. Finding them wasn’t easy, because they were scattered all over the four winds. It’s like the tsar issuing an edict in Russia. I think of Anatevka every time I see Fiddler on the Roof , the little town of Anatevka. These people, I found them in Co-op City, in small apartments, in the housing projects, living with their relatives.
And when I would come back and write my interviews, I saw that I was writing one word over and over: “lonely.” I was asking people, “What’s life like now?” And over and over again, they would say, “Lonely.” They had lost their neighborhood, their sense of community. And this is the human cost of what—part of the human cost of what Robert Moses did.
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go back to 1953. The TV program Longines Chronoscope interviewed Robert Moses. This is the anchor William Bradford Huie questioning Moses.
WILLIAM BRADFORD HUIE : Of course, to build these roads, you have to move a lot of people’s homes, don’t you, sir?
ROBERT MOSES : Yes, especially in urban communities, in urban and suburban communities. That is one of the big problems.
WILLIAM BRADFORD HUIE : Could you give us any indication of how many homes would have to be moved in building the New York Thruway?
ROBERT MOSES : Well, the New York Thruway is—I would say three-quarters of it is in open territory where there’s no problem. The other one-fourth, I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t know how many.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s Robert Moses in 1953. And I was wondering if you could comment on what he’s saying, and also the building of Jones Beach, the access to Jones Beach, what Robert Moses intended—people of color, poor people not being able to get there. Talk about this, Robert Caro.
ROBERT CARO : Well, I’ll talk about the Jones Beach first. You know, Jones Beach is, on the one side, the wonderful side of Robert Moses. He creates the world’s greatest bathing beach in Long Island. There was no place for the masses of New York City, by which was meant, then, white, middle-class people. The automobile age was just flowering. It was the 1920s. And he’s creating Jones Beach. It’s an act of great inspiration.
But he doesn’t want poor people, and, in particular, poor people of color, to use Jones Beach. So what he does—poor people in the 1920s and '30s don't have automobiles, so the only way they can get to Jones Beach is by mass transportation. So he takes care of the railroad side of that very easily: The Long Island Rail Road wants to build a spur to Jones Beach, he just says no. But they can also get out there by bus. He doesn’t want to take any chances of that, so the parkways out there—first, he has legislation passed that buses can’t use the parkways, which are the only way to Jones Beach. But then, as his chief aide once said to me, Amy, he said, “You know, the commissioner”—they called him the commissioner—”the commissioner knew that legislation can always be changed. You can’t change a bridge when it’s up.” So, if you drive out to Jones Beach, you see along the Southern State and the Meadowbrook parkways, the roads to Jones Beach, “clearance”—there are 173 of these bridges—”clearance, 13, nine inches,”“clearance, 10 feet,” because buses needed 14 feet of clearance. So people couldn’t get there in buses.
One of the revelatory moments of my life and Ina’s life, I wanted to see how this affected over the decades. So now I’m doing The Power Broker . It’s not 1930 anymore, when he opened it. It’s now, let’s say, 1970, 40 years later. There’s one big parking lot in Jones Beach with four underpasses that people use to get to the beach. We stood there. I had a pad. And I said whites, Latinos, blacks. And to this day, one of the moments that shaped my career as a biographer was the rage, really, that kept building in me as you had all these things for the white people, the number, hardly any for the Latinos and even less for the blacks. You said, this is what public works, public policy does to the powerless, to poor people, and how long the effect of it lasts.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Robert Caro, you mentioned that many people called him the commissioner.
ROBERT CARO : Yes.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I want to get back to this issue of how he was able to effect so much dramatic change in New York City through basically the skillful use of what’s known as a public authority to circumvent the elected bodies of government. And he was basically the chair or the sole member of so many little-known public authorities. How he wielded that power, if you could talk about that?
ROBERT CARO : Yes. You know, Robert Moses was a political genius. As I said, looking into him, I realized how little I knew about how political power worked, how he knew everything. He thinks he’s going to get elected to something. He runs for governor of New York state, and people don’t like him, and he loses by what I think is still the largest majority anyone ever lost by a state election in New York. He thinks he’s going to be mayor of New York. He’s not going to be mayor of New York. He realizes he has to get power to build these great public works, these huge public works, somewhere.
He takes a yellow legal pad and goes into a little room next to his office and sits there by himself and drafts legislation which basically create public authorities in the modern form. Before that, they were just entities that sold bonds to build a bridge or a tunnel, collected tolls until the bonds were paid off, and went out of existence. He created legislation that said these authorities will never go out of existence. And as long as he is head of the authorities, he’s going to have the power of the authorities. And these authorities, of course—you know, for about 30 years, if you were paying a toll at any bridge or tunnel in New York City, you were basically paying it directly to Robert Moses. He had more money to build things than the city did.
AMY GOODMAN : If you could talk about the building of Lincoln Center, this cultural mecca, and what it destroyed? And talk about the communities of color that lived in that area.
ROBERT CARO : Well, when you look at Lincoln—you know, this is why The Power Broker is a very complicated—was a complicated book to write, because there are these two vividly different sides of Robert Moses. One is this genius that can conceive of huge public works. The other is this absolute disregard to what happens to the human beings who lived there before, and also the shape in which they’re built.
When you look at Lincoln Center today—you said, before, there, it was low-income, but not a slum, but a thriving low-income neighborhood, which was simply wiped out for Lincoln Center. But what got me about Lincoln Center was that part of this Lincoln—the front part of Lincoln Center is wonderful. Go to the back wall of Lincoln Center. That’s the wall that looks out on what’s left of the neighborhood that had been there before, a poor neighborhood. It’s blank. There are almost no entrances to Lincoln Center. It’s turning its back on New York City, on the poor people of New York City.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Robert Caro, I’d like to ask you, in the little time we have left, about your writing style. I mean, your books are always very vivid and descriptive, but some of your sentences go on for pages. Could you talk about whether you consciously write these amazingly long sentences?
ROBERT CARO : Well, I don’t do that consciously. The answer to your question is a quick one: No. They just seem to—sometimes they seem to come out that way. Some people say I write too many very short sentences. I’d like to think that means I write contrasting sentences.
AMY GOODMAN : And you write longhand, and then you type? I don’t mean into a computer, but into a typewriter?
ROBERT CARO : Yeah, yes. I write my first few drafts in longhand on a legal pad, and then I use a Smith Corona Electra 210.
AMY GOODMAN : Because?
ROBERT CARO : Oh, it’s to slow myself down, Amy. I think I write too fast. I want to make myself think things through. And I find if I write it in hand, it’s a little bit slower, so I think a little bit more.
AMY GOODMAN : You are a testament to the need for journalists at newspapers, when we see staffs being cut, the level of investigation that you need to investigate power and give voice to the powerless. We want to thank you so much for being with us. We will do Part 2 and post it online at democracynow.org. Robert Caro, Pulitzer Prize-winning author. I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

Sri Lanka has banned face coverings in public, following the Easter Sunday attacks that left more than 250 people dead last week. The country’s president, Maithripala Sirisena, said he was using an emergency law to enact the ban Monday, citing public safety to outlaw “all forms of clothing that cover a person’s face and prevents them from being identified.” Muslim leaders are criticizing the move, which is thought to target the niqab and burka worn by some Muslim women. Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, tweeted, “No indication that recent Sri Lanka bombers covered their faces but President Sirisena bans face covering. That needless restriction means that Muslim women whose practice leads them to cover up now won’t be able to leave home.” This comes as 15 people, including six children, died Friday in a raid on a suspected hideout of militants connected to the attack. Three men set off explosives as troops attempted to raid the house, killing the children and three women. Thousands in Hong Kong Protest Proposal to Allow Extradition to China for Trial Apr 29, 2019
In Hong Kong, tens of thousands of people marched peacefully Sunday against a proposal that would allow people to be extradited to mainland China for trial—where they would face far fewer protections than afforded under Hong Kong’s policy known as “one country, two systems.” Many of the protesters held umbrellas, recalling the 2014 Umbrella Movement pro-democracy protests. This is Jayson Shing, one of the marchers.
Jayson Shing : “Once this law has been passed, it won’t matter if you are an average person or a foreigner coming through Hong Kong. There will be a real possibility you’ll be taken and sent off to the mainland.” Topics:"

Three prominent women’s rights activists are launching a new political action group today called Supermajority, aimed at training a new generation of women activists to take on grassroots campaigns and electoral politics. Alicia Garza, co-founder of Black Lives Matter; former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards; and Ai-jen Poo, executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, say they’ll focus on mobilizing voters for the 2020 primary and general elections. Speaking to the website Refinery29, Cecile Richards said, “Women are the majority of voters and the majority of activists. And yet they continue to be treated as a side issue and a special interest group. It’s time that women get the credit and the encouragement—and we begin to amplify the extraordinary work that women are doing.” Topics: 2020 Election The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

The latest white nationalist killing comes after the Department of Homeland Security disbanded its domestic terrorism unit last year, reassigning its analysts to other departments. DHS says the threat of “homegrown extremism” has been significantly reduced, but in a review of 50 murders committed by extremists in 2018, the Anti-Defamation League found 49 came at the hands of right-wing extremists, with white supremacists alone accounting for 39 of the murders.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman. We’re broadcasting from Washington, D.C. In breaking news, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó says a coup is underway in Caracas. Guaidó appeared this morning, in a video posted online, standing among heavily armed soldiers, proclaiming he is, quote, “starting the final phase of Operation Liberty,” unquote. Guaidó appeared alongside formerly jailed opposition leader Leopoldo López, who said he had been freed by military officers loyal to the opposition. López called on Venezuelans to rise up against the government of Nicolás Maduro.
LEOPOLDO LÓPEZ: [translated] What is happening in the capital today, all Venezuelans who want freedom should come here, disrupt order, join and encourage our soldiers, join our people. Good morning, Venezuela. Let’s do this together.
AMY GOODMAN : Reuters reports a witness later saw Venezuelan security forces fire tear gas directly at Juan Guaidó and around 70 armed men in military uniform where they had gathered near an Air Force base in Caracas.
The coup’s announcement was welcomed by the president of the European Parliament, who called it a, quote, “historic day for the return of democracy and freedom to Venezuela.” Colombia’s right-wing President Iván Duque tweeted, “We call the military and the people of #Venezuela to place themselves on the right side of history, rejecting Maduro’s dictatorship.” The coup also has apparent backing of the Trump administration and many lawmakers, including Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who tweeted, “After years of suffering freedom is waiting for people of #Venezuela. Do not let them take this opportunity from you. Now is the moment to take to the streets in support of your legitimate constitutional government. Do not allow this moment to slip away. It may not come again,” unquote.
Venezuela’s Socialist Party leader called on government supporters to amass at the presidential palace to defend President Nicolás Maduro against what he called a “small uprising of traitorous [military] soldiers backed by the U.S.” Venezuela’s defense minister said the Maduro government remains in control and that military units reported normality at barracks and bases across Venezuela. Maduro’s ally, Bolivian President Evo Morales, said in a statement, “We forcefully condemn the attempted coup d’état in Venezuela, which is being conducted by the right and backed by foreign interests,” Morales said.
We’re joined right now by Eva Golinger. She is an attorney and author who served as an adviser to the former Venezuela President Hugo Chávez. Her new book is called Confidante of 'Tyrants': The American Woman Trusted by the US’s Biggest Enemies .
We thank you so much, Eva, for joining us. What is it that you understand is taking place right now?
EVA GOLINGER : Well, there’s been, obviously, a lead-up to this situation for a couple months now, several months, really, where the opposition, led by Juan Guaidó, you know, has essentially declared themselves in charge of the country, even though they haven’t had charge of the country. Nicolás Maduro remains in power. And everyone’s been sort of waiting to see, well, what exactly is going to happen next.
And Guaidó had been calling for big marches in the streets tomorrow, on May 1st, which is also International Workers’ Day and a day of celebration usually in Venezuela in commemoration, big marches in the street. That had been announced publicly. This is similar to what took place, actually, in February, when there was humanitarian aid posted at the border from the United States, at the border with Colombia, and even though the announcement had been made that that aid would be entering the country on a certain day, it actually—the operation began the day before. So it seems as though, you know, they’re trying to get one foot ahead.
But, presently, I think some of the major developments would be, it appears, although it’s unclear what the numbers are, that some military, higher-ranking, have now sided with Guaidó and the opposition, and that Leopoldo López has been freed from his house arrest, which, of course, is major, because he’s one of the biggest figures of the far-right opposition. He can certainly garner the masses, more so even than Guaidó has done. And this was unexpected for many who were waiting until tomorrow to take to the streets. So I think we’re seeing a trickle-out effect in the streets right now in Caracas.
And, of course, we haven’t yet heard, at least as of this moment, from Nicolás Maduro. We’ve heard from several of his other Cabinet members, calling in to television programs on the— [no audio]
AMY GOODMAN : Eva Golinger, Venezuelan-American journalist, again, who served as legal adviser to former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. The latest news we have, President Trump has been briefed on events in Venezuela, where the army says it’s confronting a group of military traitors. If you can expand further on the role of the United States—of Elliott Abrams; John Bolton; the secretary of state, Pompeo; and the vice president, Pence—who, from the beginning of the re-election of Nicolás Maduro, have been congratulating Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela, though he wasn’t elected president? And interestingly, not only Fox—I was watching MSNBC , and when Guaidó’s wife came to Washington and met with Trump, their lower third read “first lady of Venezuela.”
EVA GOLINGER : Yeah, there’s been this sort of, you know, double dialogue going on, where the U.S. has recognized Guaidó as a legitimate so-called president of Venezuela, but he’s not the president of Venezuela, and he’s not in power of any of the institutions, at least as of up 'til today. We don't know what’s going to happen right now.
There’s no question that Guaidó, the opposition, would not have gotten to the point where they are today without the direct, explicit and very aggressive backing of the Trump administration. And, of course, Trump has made clear, as have all his advisers, that a military option is on the table. I think it’s curious that just recently reports came out, just in the past few hours, that Erik Prince, former owner of, founder of Blackwater, the mercenary company, has offered mercenaries to go to Venezuela. That may have already happened. Sometimes the news gets out after the fact. So, you know, I think that it’s absolutely clear that the opposition has been propped up by the United States. The U.S. has played an ongoing, aggressive role—I’ve been denouncing it now for over 15 years—in trying to undermine first the Chávez government, now Maduro’s administration.
And certainly, there are many in Venezuela who would hope for change in their country, but they don’t want a U.S.-backed regime in place. They don’t want a far-right, imposed regime that answers to foreign interests, which is what we’re seeing take place in the country. And I do believe it’s a very dangerous situation in Venezuela—there could be, you know, violent conflicts ahead—and that without this explicit backing of the United States, we wouldn’t be seeing the level of chaos that’s taking place in the country today, as well as the sanctions that have been imposed that have exacerbated Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis and the difficulties that a majority of Venezuelans are facing on an economic level in the country.

In Chicago, Boeing held its first annual shareholders’ meeting since fatal crashes of its 737 MAX airplanes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. Outside the meeting, family and friends held a silent protest demanding Boeing executives be criminally prosecuted. The demonstration was organized by the family of 24-year-old Samya Stumo, who died March 10 when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed due to a faulty flight control system. Stumo is the grandniece of consumer advocate Ralph Nader. As Boeing’s shareholders met, families of the crash victims held an emotional news conference to discuss their lawsuit against Boeing. Paul Njoroge, who lost his wife and three young children in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, said he stays up at night thinking about the horror his family endured as pilots struggled to keep the plane flying for six minutes.
Paul Njoroge : “Those six minutes will forever be embedded in my mind. I was not there to help them; I couldn’t save them. It was up to Boeing and the others in charge to save them. We paid for a safe flight, but instead my family and others in that plane have suffered a profound loss that can never be mended.” Topics: "

In West Virginia, a 22-year-old protester is facing a felony terrorism charge and other misdemeanors after he was arrested in a nonviolent civil disobedience action aimed at stopping the Mountain Valley Pipeline. Holden Dometrius was arrested Thursday about five hours after he chained himself to welding equipment, slowing construction of the fracked gas pipeline. Since February, activists have been occupying trees in the path of the pipeline route in West Virginia’s Jefferson National Forest, where the Mountain Valley Pipeline company hopes to drill through a mountain directly underneath the Appalachian Trail.

Former DHS Analyst: Trump Administration Not Taking White Nationalist Threat Seriously Enough,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/30/former_dhs_analyst_trump_administration_not,"former Department of Homeland Security senior analyst. His forthcoming book, titled Hateland: A Long, Hard Look at America’s Extremist Heart , will be out in June. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : We turn right now to our last segment. Funeral services held Monday in San Diego, California, for Lori Kaye, a 60-year-old Jewish congregant who was shot dead Saturday in the latest attack by a white supremacist on a house of worship. On Saturday morning, a man with an assault rifle entered the Chabad of Poway synagogue, opened fire during a service marking the last day of Passover. Police say the shooter fled the scene but was arrested a short time later. Prosecutors are investigating the shooting as a hate crime, after the suspect published an anti-Semitic manifesto online referencing recent massacres at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh six months ago and the pair of mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, where a white supremacist killed 50 Muslim worshipers.
The latest white nationalist killing comes after the Department of Homeland Security disbanded its domestic terrorism unit last year, reassigning its analysts to other departments. DHS says the threat of homegrown extremism has been significantly reduced. But in a review of 50 murders committed by extremists in 2018, the Anti-Defamation League found 49 came at the hand of right-wing extremists, with white supremacists alone accounting for 39 of the murders.
To talk about the rise of white supremacist violence and the Trump administration’s response, we’re joined now by Daryl Johnson, former senior analyst at the Department of Homeland Security. In 2009, Johnson authored a report warning about the increasing dangers of violent right-wing extremism in the United States, sparking a political firestorm in the process. Under pressure from Republican lawmakers and popular talk show hosts, DHS ultimately repudiated Daryl Johnson’s paper. His forthcoming book is titled Hateland: A Long, Hard Look at America’s Extremist Heart . It’ll be out in June.
Daryl Johnson, welcome to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us in these last few minutes. Can you talk about this latest attack and the attack before that, both at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, the San Diego attack at the synagogue this past weekend, white supremacist violence, looking at Charlottesville a year ago, where President Trump said of the white supremacist Klan marchers, “There are fine people on both sides”?
DARYL JOHNSON : Well, Amy, this has become the new normal. And what people don’t realize is, between that Pittsburgh synagogue attack and the one that we had this week in California, there were other arson attacks against other places of worship. We had a mosque that was arsoned in California, allegedly by the same perpetrator that conducted the latest synagogue shooting. We had three black churches down in the South that were arsoned. So, domestic terrorism is alive and well today.
AMY GOODMAN : So, talk about the fact that Homeland Security disbanded its counterterrorism unit, disbanded it last year, despite the fact that violent extremism, violent attacks are up. And the vast majority of them are being committed by white supremacists, but the investigations of them by the Department of Homeland Security, the unit in charge, Trump disbanded.
DARYL JOHNSON : Yeah, and this wasn’t the first time. I mean, my unit was disbanded back in 2009, and they reconstituted it with a few analysts in between this latest disbanding. But it’s not a very good sign that our government is getting rid of resources that could actually be helping state and local law enforcement combat this problem.
AMY GOODMAN : So, the cutting of funds to the groups within the government that investigate white supremacists, can you talk about what this means? What were these resources used for?
DARYL JOHNSON : Yeah, so, we’ve had state and local anti-terrorism training funding pulled last year under Trump. This was the U.S.'s pre-eminent domestic terrorism training for state and local law enforcement. It no longer exists. We've had grant funding pulled from organizations that wanted to study the trends that we’re seeing, as well as conduct countering violent extremism efforts to try to pull people out of these movements and reform them and acclimate them back into society. We need all hands on deck. We need every resource to be devoted to combat this problem. And it doesn’t seem like this administration is very committed to doing that.
AMY GOODMAN : Daryl Johnson, even before Trump came to power in the United States, you wrote a column for The New York Times , “For Domestic Hate, Apply the Vigor and Strategy Used for Muslim Terror. Your piece began, “Domestic terrorism is the national security threat whose name we dare not speak.”
DARYL JOHNSON : Yeah, and what I’m referring to is, a lot of these attacks, we hear in the media, as well as our politicians and even police chiefs, talk about how, you know, it’s a “crazed gunman,” or it’s a “hate crime.” These are terms to kind of disguise the fact that these are ideologically motivated attacks that fit the definition of terrorism. So, why not call it what it is?
AMY GOODMAN : Finally, how has the threat of right-wing violence changed since you did the report in 2009 under President Obama, that the right wing so fiercely attacked, the government withdrew it?
DARYL JOHNSON : Amy, I’m standing here today in disbelief that this threat is still ongoing 10 years after I wrote that report warning of the rise of this threat. That’s very disturbing. And the fact that our government at the national level hasn’t even recognized this threat and call it terrorism is pause for concern.
AMY GOODMAN : Do you think there would be a different response if it was a Muslim attacker at the Tree of Life, a Muslim attacker in San Diego? Which, again, we know it isn’t. Both were avowed white supremacists.
DARYL JOHNSON : Yeah, we clearly see there’s a double standard when it comes to our policymakers when they call out terrorism. And they pretty much apply it solely to the Muslim variety.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, we’re going to continue this conversation and post it online at democracynow.org. Daryl Johnson, former Department of Homeland Security senior analyst. His forthcoming book, titled Hateland: A Long, Hard Look at America’s Extremist Heart , will be out in June. He is the owner and founder of DT Analytics, a private consulting firm, also the author of Right-Wing Resurgence: How a Domestic Terrorist Threat Is Being Ignored .
And that does it for today’s broadcast. We’ll be bringing you the latest on Venezuela throughout the day at democracynow.org, an attempted coup underway. And we’ll be covering the Ilhan Omar defense rally today in Washington, D.C., just outside the Capitol. I’m Amy Goodman. Thanks so much for joining us.

Angela Davis: I Would Like to Accept Birmingham Civil Rights Institute Award After BDS Controversy,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/30/angela_davis_i_would_like_to,"author, professor and activist at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : Angela Davis, you returned to your hometown of Birmingham, Alabama, in February, originally planning the visit to receive the Fred L. Shuttlesworth Human Rights Award from the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, but the institute withdrew the award soon after the Birmingham Holocaust Education Center sent a letter urging the board to reconsider honoring you, due to your support of the BDS movement, Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, targeting the Israeli government and Israeli institutions because of the Israeli occupation. Facing swift and widespread outcry, the institute then reversed its decision and reinstated the award, but Angela Davis has yet to say if she will accept it. We followed you to Birmingham. It was a massive welcome for you as a Birmingham daughter. Thousands of people came out. We also interviewed the head of the Civil Rights Museum, who said she deeply hopes that you will come back to receive the award. What happened? What have you decided?
ANGELA DAVIS : Well, first of all, it was really a remarkable moment. And what impressed me so much was that especially black people, but also many white people, including Jewish people, stood up in support of the idea that Palestinians also deserve to be recognized for their human rights. It is not possible to believe in human rights but to exclude a given population. And, yeah, I would like to accept the Fred L. Shuttlesworth award, because I deeply respect the legacy of Fred Shuttlesworth, and the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute is a remarkable institution. There are some issues with the leadership that were expressed, of course, in the fact that the award was rescinded.
AMY GOODMAN : And three people on the board had to resign, after they returned—
ANGELA DAVIS : Three people resigned, yes.
AMY GOODMAN : —rescinded the rescinsion, if that’s a word—
ANGELA DAVIS : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : —after they said, “Please accept the award.” So, do you plan to return? Have you—
ANGELA DAVIS : Well, I don’t see this as an individual decision. I’m taking my leadership from on-the-ground organizers in Birmingham who recognize that it’s their responsibility to assist in the transformation of the institute. So, I understand that there are meetings underway. Of course, the Mayor’s Office funds at least half of the budget. The mayor was in the forefront of challenging the rescinsion of the award. There is an organization, a sort of ad hoc group that came together, Birmingham Truth and Reconciliation Committee. They are in conversation with the leadership of the Civil Rights Institute.
AMY GOODMAN : Have you spoken to Andrea Taylor, the president and CEO of the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute?
*ANGELA DAVIS : Have I ever spoken to her? Or have I spoken—
AMY GOODMAN : Have you spoken to her since then?
*ANGELA DAVIS : I haven’t spoken to her directly. I’m waiting to see what the outcome of the meetings might be. And I will take the leadership from those who are doing the on-the-ground work.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, I think that’s some breaking news. And I thank you both for being with us. We will cover the rally today in defense of Ilhan Omar and bring that to our viewers, listeners and readers tomorrow on Democracy Now! I want to thank you, Angela Davis, author, professor, activist, professor emeritus at the University of California, Santa Cruz, author of many books, including Freedom Is a Constant Struggle: Ferguson, Palestine, and the Foundations of a Movement , and Barbara Ransby, historian, author and activist adviser to the Movement for Black Lives, one of the planners behind Black Women in Defense of Ilhan Omar.

In breaking news, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó says a coup is underway in Caracas. Guaidó appeared this morning, in a video posted online, standing among heavily armed soldiers, proclaiming he is “starting the final phase of Operation Liberty.” He appeared alongside formerly jailed opposition leader Leopoldo López, who said he’d been freed by military officers loyal to the opposition. López called on Venezuelans to rise up against the government of Nicolás Maduro.
Leopoldo López : “What is happening in the capital today, all Venezuelans who want freedom should come here, disrupt order, join and encourage our soldiers, join our people. Good morning, Venezuela. Let’s do this together.”
The coup’s announcement was welcomed by the president of the European Parliament, who called it a “historic day for the return of democracy and freedom to Venezuela.” It has the apparent backing of the Trump administration and many members of Congress, including Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who tweeted, “After years of suffering freedom is waiting for people of #Venezuela. Do not let them take this opportunity from you. Now is the moment to take to the streets in support of your legitimate constitutional government. Do not allow this moment to slip away.

President Trump has imposed new restrictions on asylum seekers along the U.S.-Mexican border, ordering them to pay fees in order to apply for work permits and for refuge in the U.S. The new restrictions, set to take effect in 90 days, would also require already backlogged immigration courts to settle asylum applications within 180 days.

"Angela Davis & Barbara Ransby: We Stand with Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Courageous, Bold Black Woman",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/30/angela_davis_barbara_ransby_we_stand,"historian, author, activist adviser to the Movement for Black Lives and one of the planners behind Black Women in Defense of Ilhan Omar. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : Two of the founders of Black Lives Matter, as well as professor Angela Davis and scores of other black women, are holding a rally today on Capitol Hill to defend Congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and to urge Congress to censure President Trump for his attacks on her. Omar made history earlier this year when she and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan became the first Muslim women in Congress. She’s also the first member of Congress to wear a hijab.
Omar, who was born in Somalia and came to the United States as a refugee, has been at the center of numerous right-wing attacks since taking office. Congressmember Omar recently said death threats against her have spiked in number since President Trump tweeted a video juxtaposing her image with footage of the 9/11 attacks. In New York City, many Yemeni bodega owners are continuing to refuse to sell the New York Post , after it showed an image of the World Trade Center on fire with a headline attacking Omar. The Yemeni American Merchants Association said the cover provoked hatred and targeted people of the Muslim faith. Omar has also been accused of being anti-Semitic for criticizing the power of the Israeli lobby in Washington and questioning U.S.-Israeli relations.
Despite the threats, Omar has refused to be silent and has continued to speak out against racism, Islamophobia, right-wing violence and anti-Semitism. On Saturday, she condemned the deadly shooting at a synagogue in San Diego, writing, “My heart is breaking after today’s deadly shooting at Chabad Congregation in San Diego—on the last day of Passover and 6 months to the day after the Tree of Life shooting. We as a nation must confront the terrifying rise of religious hate and violence. Love trumps hate,” she tweeted.
We’re joined now by two of the organizers of today’s rally. Barbara Ransby, historian, author and activist adviser to the Movement for Black Lives and one of the planners behind Black Women in Defense of Ilhan Omar. Ransby’s latest book is Making All Black Lives Matter: Reimagining Freedom in the 21st Century . And Angela Davis joins us, author, activist, professor emeritus at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She’s the author of many books, including Freedom Is a Constant Struggle: Ferguson, Palestine, and the Foundations of a Movement .
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Angela Davis, you have traveled across the country to come here to Washington today. Why?
ANGELA DAVIS : I think it’s extremely important to demonstrate that there are many people, especially black women, but people in general, who support Ilhan Omar, who has become the target of the vitriol of the current president. She is targeted because she is an immigrant, because she is Muslim, because she is a courageous, bold black woman who speaks out in defense of Palestinians. She is not afraid to criticize Israel. And, of course, the current president has made her the target of many of his attacks. We say that we stand with her, we support her, and we will not give up.
AMY GOODMAN : The president pinned a tweet linking to a video of Ilhan Omar, going back and forth with the World Trade Center bombings. Can you talk about the significance of this and what it means?
ANGELA DAVIS : Well, of course, we know that since the election campaign, that led to the unfortunate election of Donald Trump, Trump has used Muslims as a foil. He has, of course, called for the banning of Muslim immigration into the U.S. He uses this bizarre logic of fungibility, where one Muslim represents the worst—or all Muslims, rather, represent the worst deeds that any Muslim has ever conducted. And it’s this logic of fungibility that is at the heart of racism, that is at the heart of Islamophobia. And I think that all of us who are opposed to racism, who are opposed to anti-Semitism, who are opposed to all forms of assaults against people because of their race, their background, their ethnicity, their religion, should stand with Ilhan Omar.
AMY GOODMAN : So, today at noon, Professor Barbara Ransby, here in Washington, you and others have organized this rally for Ilhan Omar, that apparently she, too, will be attending?
BARBARA RANSBY : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : To show support for Congressmember Omar. Talk about what motivated you to do this, to come in from Chicago, where you teach.
BARBARA RANSBY : Well, we’re inviting—we’ve invited 100-plus black women to show up at the Capitol. We didn’t invite more; we’re trying to be aware of our carbon footprint. But we represent organizations and sectors. There are faith leaders that are coming: Jewish women of color are coming, Muslim faith leaders, Reverend Traci Blackmon from United Church of Christ. So it’s a broad cross-section.
And the Movement for Black Lives has called this gathering to physically show that we will, you know, dissect, get ourselves out of our lives, our busy lives, and come here to stand with Ilhan Omar. And she is not only being attacked, as Angela said, because she’s an immigrant woman, because she’s a black woman, but also because she’s a progressive voice that won’t be silenced, right? So, she has spoken—you mentioned Venezuela earlier. She eloquently called Elliott Abrams to task for his history of violent, imperialist interventions in Central America. And he is, of course, being the point person for what’s going on in terms of U.S. policy in Venezuela. So, very progressive voice that is refusing to be silenced.
I think there’s two things for us. One is that we see a growing trend of attacks on African Americans who dare to speak out on foreign policy issues, particularly the question of Palestine. Of course, Angela Davis, in Birmingham, was denied an award—and then had the award reinstated—because of her principled stand on Palestine. Marc Lamont Hill fired from CNN . And the list goes on. So we’re prepared to say that we want progressive black voices, in a spirit of black internationalism, to speak out on these issues without punishment.
And the second is, you know, the targeting of black women. Trump has been vitriolic toward so many groups, but I think there’s a particular venom when it comes to black women. He has attacked Maxine Waters. He attacked Frederica Wilson in Florida. He called his former—
AMY GOODMAN : The congressmember.
BARBARA RANSBY : The congressmember. He attacked Omarosa, who I certainly don’t have very much political likeness to, but called her a dog. You know, so this kind of attacks on black women just has to be opposed.
AMY GOODMAN : You recently tweeted, “We remember Anita as we come together on April 30 to defend Ilhan.”
BARBARA RANSBY : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : In defense of Ilhan, you said.
BARBARA RANSBY : Yes, yes, absolutely. And it’s interesting that Anita Hill has been in the news lately, of course, because of Joe Biden’s bid and his inexcusable role in humiliating her and making her vulnerable. I was a part of a mobilization in 1991 called “African American Women in Defense of Ourselves”—Angela was also a part of it—which came to the defense of Anita Hill, who was being vilified, who herself suffered death threats and threats of sexual violence because of the position she was put in and the way that she was so publicly humiliated and vilified. So we see similarly with Ilhan Omar now.
And these kinds of—these words have consequences. You know, we see a rise in right-wing violence. Recently a bookstore right outside of D.C. had an anti-racist book event disrupted by white nationalists, who literally marched through and intimidated people. So, the brazenness and boldness kind of in the—very much reminding us to pre-Nazi Germany.
AMY GOODMAN : And, of course, the shooting in San Diego.
BARBARA RANSBY : And the shooting in San Diego.
AMY GOODMAN : At the synagogue.
BARBARA RANSBY : The synagogue in San Diego, the synagogue in Pittsburgh, what happened in New Zealand. All of these things point to the ways in which racist violence is being fueled by the words of Trump and others.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re going to break and then come back to this discussion. We’re talking to professor Barbara Ransby, historian, author and activist, as well as Angela Davis, author, professor and activist, who have come to Washington, D.C., with at least a hundred other women of color to stand with Congressmember Ilhan Omar, who is facing an increasing number of death threats. Stay with us.

AMY GOODMAN : John Williams’ theme to John Singleton’s critically acclaimed Rosewood . This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman. We’re broadcasting today from the nation’s capital, from Washington, D.C. I want to turn to Congresswoman Ilhan Omar in her own words. This is Omar speaking at Busboys and Poets here in Washington, D.C., earlier this year.
REP . ILHAN OMAR : No, we know what hate looks like. We experience it every single day. I have colleagues who talk about death threats. I have colleagues who talk about death threats. And sometimes—there are cities in my state where the gas stations have written on their bathrooms, “Assassinate Ilhan Omar.” I have people driving around my district looking for my home, for my office, causing me harm. I have people, every single day, on Fox News and everywhere, posting that I am a threat to this country. So I know what fear looks like. The masjid, the masjid I pray in, in Minnesota, got bombed by two domestic white terrorists. So I know what it feels to be someone who is of faith that is vilified. I know what it means to be of someone who is of ethnicity that is vilified. I know what it feels to be—
AUDIENCE MEMBER : We love you!
REP . ILHAN OMAR : —of a race, of a race—right? Like, I am an immigrant, so I don’t have the historical drama that some of my black sisters and brothers have in this country. But I know—I know what it means for people to just see me as a black person and to treat me as less than a human.
And so, when people say, “You are bringing hate,” I know what their intention is. Their intention is to make sure that our lights are dimmed, that we walk around with our heads bowed, that we lower our face and our voice.
AMY GOODMAN : That was Congressmember Ilhan Omar speaking at the local restaurant and gathering place Busboys and Poets in these last few months.
Our guests are Angela Davis, author, professor, activist at University of California, Santa Cruz, professor emeritus, and Barbara Ransby, one of the people and movements who have organized with the Movement for Black Lives a defense rally today of Ilhan Omar. As you listen to Ilhan Omar, Angela Davis, your thoughts?
ANGELA DAVIS : Well, first of all, I am extremely proud that finally we’ve elected someone to Congress who speaks out in such a powerful way on behalf of black women, on behalf of Palestinians, on behalf of all people who are oppressed.
I’m also quite afraid for her. We know that she has received many death threats. And we know that much of the attention that is focused on her as an individual is meant to also focus on all of us who are trying to speak out against the current policies of the U.S. government, and particularly the policies on Israel. We experienced the assassination of another elected official in the American hemisphere, Marielle Franco in Brazil, a little more than a year ago. And it pains me to—
AMY GOODMAN : She was the Rio councilmember, major LGBTQ activist.
ANGELA DAVIS : Absolutely, absolutely. And she received threats and was targeted in the same way that Ilhan Omar is being targeted today. And so, I—
AMY GOODMAN : And it looks like one of the people involved with her killing, who’s been accused of that, has a relationship with the Bolsonaro family, the current right-wing president of Brazil.
ANGELA DAVIS : Oh, absolutely, and they were both former police officers. So we know that the government was directly involved in this attempt to eliminate Marielle Franco. Fortunately, there is a vast movement in Brazil. Her memory is being defended, and the black women’s movement in Brazil has only grown in the aftermath of her assassination.
It is up to us to prevent a similar set of circumstances from unfolding here in the United States, in defending Ilhan Omar. I have to really thank Barbara Ransby, who has done such an amazing job helping to organize this event with the Movement for Black Lives. And Barbara mentioned earlier that she participated in the defense of Anita Hill, Black Women in Defense of Ourselves. She was one of the main organizers of that massive movement.
AMY GOODMAN : Back in 1991—
ANGELA DAVIS : Back in 19—
AMY GOODMAN : —when Anita Hill testified against then-nominee—
ANGELA DAVIS : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : —now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
It’s been very interesting to see the changing landscape, political, ideological landscape, when it comes to Israel. The current edition of Newsweek has a full picture of Ilhan Omar, and the headline is “Ilhan Omar, the Democrats and Israel.” And the article , by [Jonathan] Broder, is looking at the breaking of the consensus, particularly within the Democratic Party, around support for AIPAC , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. You look at the AIPAC meeting that just took place. Among those who didn’t attend were one after another Democratic presidential candidate. Senator Bernie Sanders wasn’t there. Senator Kamala Harris wasn’t there. Senator Elizabeth Warren wasn’t there. Beto O’Rourke wasn’t there. Julián Castro wasn’t there. Washington Governor Jay Inslee wasn’t there. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg wasn’t there. Beto O’Rourke recently called Netanyahu a racist.
Can you talk about this breaking of the consensus? You then have an event that’s taking place at University of Massachusetts Amherst that’s getting tremendous pushback, that has people like Marc Lamont Hill going, as well as Linda Sarsour, Dave Zirin and Sut Jhally of the Media Education Foundation. You have a number of groups protesting this, but you also have them pushing back and the university standing up for the right of this gathering to speak about Palestine, that’s going to be taking place May 4th, this Saturday. So there is a breaking of consensus. Ilhan Omar is not out there alone, though she is the lightning rod for all of this.
ANGELA DAVIS : Absolutely, absolutely.
BARBARA RANSBY : Yeah, it’s so important. I mean, I think there’s a number of variables. And Angela’s leadership and visibility on this, since the delegation in 2011, you know, has been really remarkable. And I also just want to put in context, you know, the movement in Brazil in response to Marielle Franco. But here, you know, it’s not just us, it’s also Thenjiwe McHarris and Miski Noor and some of the young leaders in the Movement for Black Lives, who, in 2016, included in their “Vision for Black Lives” solidarity with Palestinian human rights, and caught a lot of flak for it and had funders move away from them because of it. So I think it’s this generation of young black and Latinx activists. It’s also young Jewish activists, in Jewish Voice for Peace, in IfNotNow, who are breaking the silence around Israel. And it’s so important. So it’s important that Ilhan is not alone on that question and many others.
AMY GOODMAN : You have Patrisse Cullors coming out today, Alicia Garza, the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement, coming out for Ilhan Omar, that’s happening today at noon?
BARBARA RANSBY : Yes, absolutely, and a wide range of organizations. Black Women’s Blueprint is involved, Black Youth Project 100. Black women from all over the country are coming to say we stand with Ilhan and that other women stand with us. So we’re telling the Republicans to back off. We’re also telling the Democrats to step up and have a much more vigorous defense of her.
AMY GOODMAN : You know, if people were just watching the news, they would think that Ilhan Omar only speaks about Israel. But, in fact, she takes on many, many different issues and is the forefront on those. I want to turn to Congressmember Ilhan Omar questioning Trump’s special envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, on his record, earlier this year.
REP . ILHAN OMAR : In 1991, you pleaded guilty to two counts of withholding information from Congress regarding your involvement in the Iran-Contra affair, for which you were later pardoned by President George H.W. Bush. I fail to understand why members of this committee or the American people should find any testimony that you give today to be truthful.
ELLIOTT ABRAMS : If I can respond to that—
REP . ILHAN OMAR : It wasn’t a question.
AMY GOODMAN : That was Ilhan Omar questioning Trump’s special envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams—Elliott Abrams, who was convicted of lying to Congress, appointed by President Trump to be the point person on Venezuela. In a moment we’re going to be speaking more about Venezuela, because as this broadcast got underway, Juan Guaidó, the head of the National Assembly, is currently attempting a coup against the Venezuelan president. We’ll see how this unfolds throughout the day. But the significance of Ilhan Omar on all of these fronts, Angela Davis?
ANGELA DAVIS : Well, Ilhan Omar is a major progressive voice on foreign policy issues, on issues of racism, on issues of misogyny. And finally, we do have someone in Congress who is not afraid to stand up and fight back. And, of course, I’m not at all attempting to belittle the legacy of people like Barbara Lee and Maxine Waters, who have been struggling with the Democrats in Congress for many years. But I think it’s particularly important that she took the lead in challenging the position on Venezuela.
The apparent coup that is underway now, supported of course by the U.S. government, is an attempt to increase the effect of the move towards the right throughout the world—Bolsonaro in Brazil, of course Duterte in the Philippines, Netanyahu re-elected in Israel. And, of course, one might be critical of the current leadership of Venezuela, but he was democratically elected. You know, what would we say in this country if another power decided to support a coup in the U.S., even though we have a president—well, we won’t get into that now, but you get the point that I’m making.

The Pentagon has acknowledged it’s investigating four additional military members for their ties to the white nationalist movement known as Identity Evropa, bringing the total number of the group’s members known to be under investigation to 11. This comes after prosecutors in Maryland revealed new details in their case against Coast Guard lieutenant Christopher Hasson, who was indicted on gun and drug charges earlier this year. They say Hasson searched for the home addresses of two Supreme Court justices and targeted two social media company executives; he also reportedly searched for the phrase “please god let there be a race war.” Topics: "

Vote Headline Apr 30, 2019
In Western Sahara, Moroccan authorities have swept out across the city of Laayoune in a bid to crush protests, as activists call for an referendum on the status of the territory and demand the release of political prisoners. Video clandestinely recorded and circulated on social media sites shows activists Mina Bali and Aziza Biza being beaten by plainclothes security officers as they protest peacefully in the streets of Western Sahara’s territorial capital. Mina Bali suffered broken bones in her hand requiring surgery. Meanwhile, Sultana Khaya, a famed Sahrawi activist who had her eye gouged out by a Moroccan police officer in 2007 during a peaceful protest, was stopped by authorities as she tried to enter Laayoune and was turned around. The latest crackdown on dissent by Morocco comes as the U.N. Security Council is set to vote today on an extension of the U.N.'s mandate in Western Sahara; Morocco is seeking to prevent U.N. peacekeepers there from adding human rights monitoring to their mandate. Morocco has occupied Western Sahara since 1975, and no other country on Earth recognizes its sovereignty over the territory.

Schumer to Support Green New Deal Arrested in New York Headline May 01, 2019
And in New York City, police arrested seven nonviolent protesters Tuesday as they peacefully blocked access to Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer’s Manhattan office. The youth activists with the Sunrise Movement are calling on the Senate Minority Leader to endorse the Green New Deal, a resolution calling for a transformation of the U.S. economy by funding renewable energy while ending U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by 2030.
Youth activist : “I’m willing to get arrested and put my body on the line for the Green New Deal, because it means the bodies of all of the people who are being affected by the climate crisis. We are here demanding that Senator Schumer sign on to a Green New Deal. Stand with us, Chuck Schumer.”
Sunrise Movement leaders have asked Senator Schumer to convene town hall meetings to discuss his climate plan, but say their requests have been rebuffed or ignored. This is Aracely Jimenez, a resident of Brooklyn’s Sunset Park neighborhood.
Aracely Jimenez : “I have lived in Sunset Park since I was 4 years old. It is a low-income, immigrant community of color. And it was ravaged by Hurricane Sandy. So I have seen what the climate crisis is going to do, what it’s already doing to communities like mine all across this planet. And when our Senate minority leader refuses to co-sponsor the only plan on the table that is going to address the crisis at the scale that science and justice demand, then that is unacceptable. I will not stand for it, and neither should you!” Topics:"
"Economist Jeffrey Sachs: U.S. Sanctions Have Devastated Venezuela & Killed Over 40,000 Since 2017 | Democracy Now!",www.democracynow.org,,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/1/economist_jeffrey_sachs_us_sanctions_have,"professor at Pomona College, author of The Enduring Legacy: Oil, Culture, and Society in Venezuela and Venezuela: What Everyone Needs to Know . Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman. Our guests are Miguel Tinker Salas, a Venezuelan professor at Pomona College in California; Jeffrey Sachs is with us here in New York, leading economist and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. He’s recently co-authored a report for the Center for Economic and Policy Research headlined “Economic Sanctions as Collective Punishment: The Case of Venezuela.”
So much is being used against the presidency of Maduro, saying he’s brought the country to an economic standstill. You make a different case, Jeffrey Sachs.
JEFFREY SACHS : Well, it’s not an economic standstill. It’s a complete economic collapse, a catastrophe, in Venezuela. There was a crisis, for sure, before Trump came to office, but the idea of the Trump administration, from the start, has been to overthrow Maduro. That’s not a hypothesis. Trump was very explicit in discussions with presidents of Latin America, where he asked them, “Why shouldn’t the U.S. just invade?” He said that already in 2017. So the idea of the Trump administration has been to overthrow Maduro from the start. Well, the Latin leaders said, “No, no, that’s not a good idea. We don’t want military action.” So the U.S. government has been trying to strangle the Venezuelan economy.
It started with sanctions in 2017 that prevented, essentially, the country from accessing international capital markets and the oil company from restructuring its loans. That put Venezuela into a hyperinflation. That was the utter collapse. Oil earnings plummeted. The earnings that are used to buy food and medicine collapsed. That’s when the social, humanitarian crisis went spiraling out of control. And then, in this year, with this idea, very naive, very stupid, in my view, that there would be this self-proclaimed president, which was all choreographed with the United States very, very closely, another round of even tighter sanctions, essentially confiscating the earnings and the assets of the Venezuelan government, took place.
Now Venezuela is in complete, utter catastrophe, a lot of it brought on by the United States deliberately, creating massive, massive suffering. We know there’s hunger. We know there’s a incredible shortage of medical supplies. We can only imagine, because we won’t know really until the dust settles and careful studies are done, how much excess mortality there is, but, surely, in a context like this, this is a catastrophe largely created by the U.S., because, as was said earlier, this is an all-or-nothing strategy. What the U.S.—what Trump just doesn’t understand and what Bolton, of all, of course, never agrees to, is the idea of negotiations. This is an attempt at an overthrow. It’s very crude. It’s not working. And it’s very cruel, because it’s punishing 30 million people.
AMY GOODMAN : How did you come up with the number 40,000 dead as a result of these crippling U.S. sanctions?
JEFFREY SACHS : Let me be clear: Nobody knows. This was a very basic, simple calculation based on estimates of universities in Venezuela that mortality had increased by a certain proportion after the sanctions. I don’t want anyone to think that there is precision in these numbers. What is certain, though, staring us in the face, is that there is a humanitarian catastrophe, deliberately caused by the United States, by what I would say are illegal sanctions, because they are deliberately trying to bring down a government and trying to create chaos for the purpose of an overthrow of a government.
AMY GOODMAN : Why?
JEFFREY SACHS : Why are they doing that? This is normal U.S. right-wing foreign policy, nothing different. This is the same foreign policy that we saw throughout Latin America in the 20th century. It’s the same foreign policy that we saw catastrophically in the Middle East. This is Mr. Bolton. This is Mr. Bolton’s idea of diplomacy. This is Trump’s idea of diplomacy. You punch someone in the face. You crush your opponent. You try whatever way you can to get your way. It’s very simpleminded. It’s very crude. And, Amy, it never works. It just leads to catastrophe.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to bring Miguel Tinker Salas back into this conversation, professor at Pomona College. As these protests were taking place in—or this coup attempt was taking place in Venezuela, in Honduras there were massive protests against privatization, also huge demonstrations in Paris. You certainly don’t get the same kind of coverage.
MIGUEL TINKER SALAS : No, you don’t. And the reality is that what’s happening in Honduras is fundamental. You have an effort at privatization. You have layoffs of doctors and of professors and of teachers. And there’s massive street protests happening in Tegucigalpa and all the major cities. And the attention is all on Venezuela. And the same thing is happening, in other contexts, for Central America, the immigration that’s happening as a result of failed U.S. policies. As a colleague was saying earlier, the reality is this was tried elsewhere. The regime change that’s being tried in Venezuela has been tried elsewhere in Latin America and has led to humanitarian crisis throughout Central America—Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, in Mexico until very recently. So, again, we know the formula. We know it doesn’t produce the change that most people want. And what it does is it aggravates conditions for the majority of the population. So, you have, in the case of Venezuela, mistakes made by the Maduro administration that are now exacerbated by the sanctions and that take a toll on humans and on the population of the country.
AMY GOODMAN : We’ve been showing, for our radio audience, video, just to let you know, of the tear-gassing of people in Paris and Honduras right now. Of course, Honduras is a U.S. ally. We’re not getting as much coverage of this. Finally, I wanted to ask Jeffrey Sachs about this issue you raise of collective punishment, and saying that collective punishment of a civilian population, as described by both the Geneva and Hague international conventions, to which the U.S. is a signatory—in that way.
JEFFREY SACHS : And, I would say, of the OAS also, which explicitly prohibits this kind of hostile action against another country. U.S. sanctions are now being imposed to bring down governments everywhere. You have, similarly in Iran yesterday, a big announcement of the collapse of the Iranian economy, and the IMF attributed it to U.S. sanctions. So, this is what the Trump administration is trying to do also vis-à-vis Nicaragua. Trump said yesterday, total blockade on Cuba, if they don’t smart up. This is pure bullying. It is completely against international law. It creates havoc. It’s hard enough to achieve economic progress, but when the U.S. is using its political power to break other countries, the results absolutely can be devastating.
And we see it in Venezuela, that it was the kick that pushed Venezuela into this catastrophic, spiraling decline and hyperinflation. It’s always blamed in our press on Maduro, but people don’t even look and understand how the U.S. has the instruments of sanctions blocking access to financial markets, pushing enterprises into default, blocking trade, confiscating the assets owned by the Venezuelan government, precisely to and with the design of creating this kind of crisis, because the idea is, if the pain is enough—in the thinking of people like Bolton—then there will be a military overthrow. So they’re trying to create absolute disaster.
Well, what’s so stupid about these American policies, these neocon policies, is they do create disaster, but they don’t achieve even the political goals of these nasty people like Bolton. It’s not as if they’re effective and nasty; they’re completely ineffective and totally nasty at the same time. But Congress, in our country, nobody looks. It’s unbelievable that you have this basically one-man show of Trump doing damage, rampaging around the world. There is no oversight at all. And in the international institutions, like the IMF , the Inter-American Development Bank, people are scared to even say the truth, that this bully, of the United States, especially with the kind of president we have right now—no one wants to speak the obvious facts of how much damage is being done, how many lives are being lost, how much suffering is being created, how many refugees are being created—deliberately. And then, of course, you get The New York Times or someone else saying it’s Maduro’s whatever, because they don’t even look at the obvious process.
AMY GOODMAN : And you Democratic leaders, as well, in Congress saying the same thing. And so, we’re going to turn right now to a Democrat in Congress. We want to thank Jeffrey Sachs, who is a leading economist, director of the Center for Sustainable Development, Columbia University. We’ll link to your report that you put out with the Center for Economic and Policy Research headlined “Economic Sanctions as Collective Punishment: The Case of Venezuela.” And, Miguel Tinker Salas, thanks for joining us, professor at Pomona College in California.

"""It Is About Time"": Rep. Ilhan Omar on Supporting Impeachment of Trump & Medicare for All",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/1/it_is_about_time_rep_ilhan,"Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : Congressmember Ilhan Omar, I know your time is very short, and I wanted to ask, with the media painting you as a one-issue congressmember, what you think is being missed. For example, yesterday, the first-ever hearing on Medicare for all, the emotional testimony of Ady Barkan, who is dying of ALS , and others. If you can talk about Medicare for all, why you’ve come out in support of it, and also whether you feel that President Trump should be impeached?
REP . ILHAN OMAR : Yeah. So, Medicare for all and the testimony of Ady, the very impassioned testimony of someone we all love and are, you know, really excited that he gets the opportunity—he got the opportunity to speak at the first hearing of a policy that he’s been so passionate about, is one that I am really privileged enough to be the vice chair of, the Medicare for All Caucus. It’s important that we recognize healthcare as a human right and that we make sure that everyone, regardless of their economic status here in this country or their employment status, should have access to healthcare. It’s one that I’m very passionate about.
I talked about how my aunt, at a young age, in Somalia, died because she didn’t have access to insulin to take care of her diabetes. And in Minnesota, we had a very young man, around the same age as my aunt, in his early twenties, who died because he could not afford insulin. And so, to have something like that happen, not in a country like Somalia, but here in the United States, as well, is one that we should be ashamed of and one that we should work really hard to make sure it doesn’t happen again. And in—
AMY GOODMAN : Impeachment?
REP . ILHAN OMAR : Yeah, and in the question of impeachment, it’s about time. We’ve had the investigations. Mueller has clearly stated that if he was giving a different opinion by the general attorney, that he would indict. And now he’s kicked the ball to Congress. And we have an opportunity now to start impeachment proceedings for events that happened pre-election. And Rashida, myself, Alex and others are pushing to make sure that we can investigate post-election Trump and many of the obstructions and criminal activities that might have taken place in his White House.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you so much for being with us, Congressmember Ilhan Omar, Minnesota congressmember representing the 5th Congressional District, first Somali American elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, one of the first Muslim women in Congress. I know you have to leave us, but we’re going to turn now, with your words, the words you shared yesterday at the Reflecting Pool outside the Capitol, speaking at the rally in your support.
REP . ILHAN OMAR : Here’s the thing that really offends a lot of people and the reason that we are here. I was born—I was born as a very liberated human being, to a country that was colonized, that recognized that they can colonize the land but they can’t colonize your mind, to people who recognized that all of us deserve dignity and that no human being was ever, ever going to tell you that you are less than them. Thirteen people organized for our independence in Somalia. So I was born in that breath of recognizing that they might be more powerful than you are, that they might have more technology than you have, they might think that they are wiser than you, they might control all of the institutions, but you control your mind, and that is what sets you free.
So, a sister of mine on TV said the thing that upsets—the thing that upsets the occupant of the White House, his goons in the Republican Party, many of our colleagues in the Democratic Party, is that—is that they can’t stand—they cannot stand that a refugee, a black woman, an immigrant, a Muslim, shows up in Congress thinking she’s equal to them. But I say to them, “How else did you expect me to show up?”
So here is the reality. I tell people every single day, I have a certificate that everyone else has hanged in their offices in Congress, the same exact certificate of election. But I got more people who voted for me and sent me here than 428 of them. So, when they say, “Who does she think she is?”—when they say, “Who does she think she is?” I am the one that the people sent to be a voice for them. So we have to always recognize that one marginalized voice represents many marginalized voices.
But I don’t only represent one marginalized voice, because in this country being black is enough of being marginalized. But I also happen to be a woman. That’s a second marginalization. I happen to be a Muslim. And I also, also happen to be a refugee and an immigrant, from what they call one of the “shithole countries.” The reality is, that “shithole country” raised a very proud, dignified person. Our circumstances might not always be perfect, but that doesn’t lessen our humanity. And I am not in the business of defending mine.
So, when this—when this occupant of the White House chooses to attack me, we know—we know that that attack isn’t for Ilhan. That attack is the continuation of the attacks that he’s leveled against women, against people of color, against immigrants, against refugees, and certainly against Muslims. And we are collectively saying—we are collectively saying, “Your vile attacks, your demented views are not welcome here. This is not—this is not going to be the country of the xenophobics. This is not going to be the country of white people. This is not going to be the country of the few. This is the country of the many. This is a country that was founded—this is the country that was founded on the history of Native American genocide, on the backs of black slaves, but also by immigrants.” And so, as much as we need to remedy the history that we continue to neglect, we also must recognize that every, every liberty that we enjoy here, every single progress we get to celebrate, came about because immigrants participated in it.

AMY GOODMAN : Minnesota Congressmember Ilhan Omar, speaking in front of the Capitol at a protest in her defense, organized by black women leaders. Sitting behind her, Angela Davis, Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, urging Congress to censure President Trump, who they referred to simply as the occupant of the White House, for his attacks on Omar and to send a message to both political parties: “Hands off Ilhan Omar!” She says she has suffered a spike in death threats against her since President Trump pinned a tweet of a video that juxtaposed Ilhan Omar against the 9/11 attacks.

Hands Off Ilhan Omar: Angela Davis & Black Women Leaders Defend Congresswoman from Right-Wing Attacks,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/1/hands_off_ilhan_omar_angela_davis,"Transcript This is a rush transcript.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman. African-American women leaders gathered on Capitol Hill Tuesday in defense of Congressmember Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim congresswomen in history, the first member of Congress to wear a hijab. Omar has been the target of numerous right-wing attacks since taking office, including by President Donald Trump himself. Omar says death threats against her have spiked in number since President Trump tweeted a video juxtaposing her image with footage of the 9/11 attacks. Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, civil rights icon Angela Davis and others addressed the crowd Tuesday to urge Congress to censure President Trump—who they referred to simply as “the occupant of the White House”—for his attacks on Omar and to send a message to both political parties: “Hands off Ilhan Omar!” This is Congressmember Ayanna Pressley.
REP . AYANNA PRESSLEY : I had to come here to lend my voice and solidarity. Yeah, I happen to be a congresswoman, but before all the commas and titles, I’m a black woman. And Ilhan is my sister. … I am changing the things I can no longer accept. And from R. Kelly to Donald Trump, what we can no longer accept is the silencing of black women! This is a reckoning. This is us assuming our rightful place as the table shakers, as the truth tellers, as the justice seekers, as the preservers of democracy. We are demanding that you trust black women, that you see black women, that you believe black women and honor us for the role that we have played as healers and preservers of this democracy and this nation!
THENJIWE McHARRIS: Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib.
REP . RASHIDA TLAIB : You know, I grew up in the most beautiful, blackest city in the country, in the city of Detroit. And many—and many of my teachers, my mothers on the block, all of them accepted me as a Palestinian woman, as a woman that understands through the lens of my ancestors, through the lens of my living grandmother in the West Bank, in the Occupied Territories of Philistine. They knew what I meant when I talked about the pain of oppression or the pain of feeling less than.
And I remember Ilhan saying that to me once, like, “You know, Rashida, I was born in a community where I was the majority, but you were born in a country where you felt like you were second-class immediately when you were born, right?” And this is a woman that speaks that way, that is raw, that is real. And I cannot stand that they continue to police her, they continue to police our words, they continue to police our positions. But I say hands off. Hands off of the women of color that serve in the United States Congress. Not only—not only do we look differently, but we serve and we fight differently. And it also means that we talk differently. It’s also that we are allowed to be angry in this country.
THENJIWE McHARRIS: Angela Davis.
ANGELA DAVIS : It is about time that we stepped up to defend those who represent our political vision on the front lines of struggle. I feel particularly motivated to join this amazing group, because the attack against Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, while it is clearly directed at her as an individual, is also designed to dissuade all of us from speaking out on issues that are considered controversial. The attacks on her emanating from the occupant’s Twitter feed—that’s right, the occupant’s Twitter feed—and the numerous threats of assassination from white nationalists and their supporters are a way of sending messages to other black women, to all who hold radical and progressive political views, that they, too, can be made into targets of vitriolic, violent racism: “Be quiet, or you will suffer the fate of Ilhan Omar.” That is the message. But we do not heed that message. We refuse to be quiet.
AMY GOODMAN : Human rights leader, scholar, professor Angela Davis, speaking in defense of Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who has repeatedly been accused of being anti-Semitic for criticizing the power of AIPAC and the Israeli lobby in Washington and questioning U.S.-Israeli relations. Despite the threats, she has refused to be silent and has continued to speak out against racism, against Islamophobia, against anti-Semitism and right-wing violence.
Ilhan Omar, I wanted to ask you about, well, one of the many comments was Traci Backmon, Reverend Blackmon, saying that Islamophobia and anti-Semitism grow from the same tree, that they are different branches of the same hate. Can you talk about this?
REP . ILHAN OMAR : Yeah. I mean, I referenced it as being of this—you know, the two sides of the same bigoted coin. We know that many of the people who are targeting the Jewish community for anti-Semitism are also targeting the Muslim community in Islamophobia. And so, we have to collectively work together to uplift our voices and say no to hate. We know that both of our communities here in the United States are targeted by white supremacists, and we know that the conservatives sort of are doing everything that they can to distance themselves, to disinform the public about the monsters that they helped feed, that are now causing devastation in mosques and in synagogues. And if we are not collectively wising up to that reality, then we will suffer the pain of it.
AMY GOODMAN : President Trump recently said, in speaking to local media, talking about you, “She is somebody that doesn’t really understand life, real life. … She’s got a way about her that’s very, very bad for our country.” If you can respond to this and tell us about your real life, where you were born—
REP . ILHAN OMAR : Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : —what you’ve survived?
REP . ILHAN OMAR : Yeah. I mean, unlike the president, I don’t adhere to the belief that we should be furthering xenophobia in this country. This is my country. There is no his America. This is our America. We collectively live in this country. And I have as much of a right to it as he does and anyone else. So, that’s one.
Second, let me just say this: For this president, who really was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, who rode the backs of marginalized people to make his money, to talk to me, as someone who survived war, lived in a refugee camp, learned English in six months, worked almost every single job that you can imagine, from cleaning offices to being a cashier to working my way up to now being a member of Congress, with only two decades of being in this country, to talk to me about real life, it really tells you how demented he sounds and how much he’s really willing to go in furthering the demonization and the silencing of minority communities, who understand that we have the power as people to stand up to him, to fight for the America we know we deserve, and to practice the kind of political joy that allows for all of us to participate and fight for prosperity, not for the few, but for the many.

Ilhan Omar Speaks Out Against U.S. Sanctions & Bipartisan Support for Regime Change in Venezuela,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/1/ilhan_omar_speaks_out_against_us,"Ilhan Omar Speaks Out Against U.S. Sanctions & Bipartisan Support for Regime Change in Venezuela Story May 01, 2019 Donate
Amid an ongoing coup attempt in Venezuela, we speak with Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who questioned U.S. special envoy to Venezuela Elliott Abrams on Capitol Hill in February about his record. Abrams is a right-wing hawk who was linked to the 2002 coup attempt in Venezuela that tried to topple Hugo Chávez. In the 1980s, Abrams defended Guatemalan dictator General Efraín Ríos Montt as he oversaw a campaign of mass murder and torture of indigenous people. Ríos Montt was later convicted of genocide. Rep. Ilhan Omar says that there is a direct correlation between this type of detrimental U.S. foreign policy in Latin America and “the kind of mass migration that we’re noticing right now from Central America and South America to the U.S.” This is viewer supported news.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, as we turn now to Congressmember Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota congressmember. She is the first Somali American elected to Congress, the House of Representatives, one of the first Muslim women in Congress. In February, Ilhan Omar questioned U.S. special envoy to Venezuela Elliott Abrams on Capitol Hill.
We welcome you to Democracy Now! Congressmember Ilhan Omar, before we talk about the remarkable rally held for you, in defense of you, yesterday, just outside the Capitol next to the Reflecting Pool, if you can comment what’s taking place right now in Venezuela, the U.S.-supported coup attempt against President Maduro?
REP . ILHAN OMAR : Thank you, Amy, for having me. It’s really great to join you all this morning.
I concur with what Professor Sachs was saying. You know, I mean, a lot of the policies that we have put in place has kind of helped lead the devastation in Venezuela. And we’ve sort of set the stage for where we’re arriving today. This particular bullying and the use of sanctions to eventually intervene and make regime change really does not help the people of countries like Venezuela, and it certainly does not help and is not in the interest of the United States. And I think, finally, we have folks in Congress that see what Professor Sachs was referencing.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to turn right now to your questioning, Congressmember Ilhan Omar, your questioning of Elliott Abrams, the man who President Trump has made the special envoy to Venezuela. Elliott Abrams, the person who was convicted of lying to Congress twice, ultimately he was pardoned by President George H.W. Bush. But this is Elliott Abrams before you, in committee.
REP . ILHAN OMAR : In 1991, you pleaded guilty to two counts of withholding information from Congress regarding your involvement in the Iran-Contra affair, for which you were later pardoned by President George H.W. Bush. I fail to understand why members of this committee or the American people should find any testimony that you give today to be truthful.
ELLIOTT ABRAMS : If I can respond to that—
REP . ILHAN OMAR : It wasn’t a question.
AMY GOODMAN : Congressmember Ilhan Omar, if you can talk about the significance of Elliott Abrams being made the point person on Venezuela, and what you do think Congress can do? I mean, congressional leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others, a bipartisan group, are supporting Guaidó, the man who simply announced that he’s president of Venezuela.
REP . ILHAN OMAR : People like Elliott Abrams, neocons and warmongers, you know, for so long have pushed for policies that are now—we can see, not only in Central America, but many parts of the world, the kind of devastations that they’ve had for decades. I could not pass up the opportunity to not only remind the American people that this was someone who was convicted of lying to Congress, but also someone who had a heavy hand in some of the most devastating policies that we imposed on Central America, and that there is a direct correlation between the kind of mass migration that we’re noticing right now from Central America and South America to this country.
I think, for so long, we’ve used muscle memory to sort of generate our foreign policy. And it’s about time, like Professor Sachs said, that we pause and we look at the kind of implications that our policies have, what our ultimate goal is, what is being successful, and what are some policies that we should do away with. I remember talking to Madam Secretary Albright and talking to her about the success of sanctions we impose around the world and how some of them have devastating effects on the actual population and not on the governments that we see as our adversaries. And she concurred with me that many of the sanctions that we impose ultimately lead to devastations—and we are seeing it now in Venezuela—and ultimately lead to having severe problems in that country, which doesn’t stabilize life for the people, and certainly puts us here in the United States at risk.
AMY GOODMAN : Congressmember Ilhan Omar, we’re going to break and then come back to talk about this unusual rally that was held just outside the Capitol building next to the Reflecting Pool yesterday. Black women from around the country came in, led by, among others, Angela Davis. You stood with your sister congressmembers, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley. And people expressed their support for you, deeply concerned about the spike in the number of death rates against you and President Trump’s singular attack on you. We’re going to go to that in one moment. The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

AMY GOODMAN : Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is claiming to have defeated a coup attempt launched by opposition leader Juan Guaidó, the president of the Venezuelan National Assembly. On Tuesday morning, Guaidó appeared in an online video standing among heavily armed soldiers, calling for the military to back what he called the “final phase” of an effort to topple Maduro’s government. Guaidó appeared alongside Leopoldo López, a longtime opposition leader, who was reportedly released from house arrest by renegade officers. Guaidó has been attempting to topple the Venezuelan government since January, when he declared himself to be Venezuela’s interim president.
The Trump administration, as well as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and others, openly supported the coup attempt. Earlier today, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox Business military action in Venezuela is possible, quote, “if that’s what is required.”
On Tuesday, clashes broke out in the streets of Caracas and other cities. There are reports that one person has died and a hundred people were injured. On Tuesday night, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro gave a televised address and denied claims by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that he had prepared to flee Venezuela.
PRESIDENT NICOLÁS MADURO : [translated] Mike Pompeo said in the afternoon that Maduro had a plane to flee to Cuba and that the Russians got him off the plane and forbade him from leaving the country. Mr. Pompeo, what a lack of sincerity! Mr. Bolton also gave orders to military and civilian personnel in Venezuela to join the coup. The skirmish in Venezuela has been defeated, and Mr. Trump set off a thousand expletives and lies. My god, how far are the men in the United States government willing to go?
AMY GOODMAN : Maduro and Guaidó have both called on supporters to take to the streets today. At the United Nations, Venezuela’s U.N. Ambassador Samuel Moncada accused the United States and other nations of backing the coup attempt.
SAMUEL MONCADA : [translated] This was not a domestic event growing from within. No, this came from abroad. Without the power of the United States, the CIA , with the intelligence apparatus, without the money from the United States, without the economic war, without the government of President Duque in Colombia, this would have been impossible, without the help of the government of Chile, which gives protection to the leader of the coup, without the help of the Brazilian president, Mr. Bolsonaro, who gives help to the soldiers. This is an international conspiracy.
AMY GOODMAN : In Washington, national security adviser John Bolton repeated the Trump administration’s position on Venezuela, saying all options are on the table. He also insisted Tuesday’s events were not a coup.
JOHN BOLTON : We want, as our principal objective, the peaceful transfer of power. But I will say again, as the president has said from the outset, and that Nicolás Maduro and those supporting him, particularly those who are not Venezuelans, should know, is all options are on the table. … This is clearly not a coup. We recognize Juan Guaidó as the legitimate interim president of Venezuela. And just as it’s not a coup when the president of the United States gives an order to the Department of Defense, it’s not a coup for Juan Guaidó to try and take command of the Venezuelan military.
AMY GOODMAN : To talk more about the situation, we’re joined by two guests. Miguel Tinker Salas is a Venezuelan historian and professor at Pomona College in California, author of The Enduring Legacy: Oil, Culture, and Society in Venezuela and Venezuela: What Everyone Needs to Know . He’s joining us from Claremont, California. And here in New York, Jeffrey Sachs, leading economist and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, is with us. He recently co-authored a report for the Center for Economic and Policy Research on the deadly impact of the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela. The center is estimating more than 40,000 Venezuelans have died since 2017 as a result of the sanctions.
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Professor Miguel Tinker Salas, let’s begin with you. What do you understand is happening on the ground right now in Venezuela? What has taken place? And the significance of Juan Guaidó standing together with Leopoldo López?
MIGUEL TINKER SALAS : What took place yesterday was an intended coup. The problem is, if you’re going to stage a coup, you normally would have the generals and the admirals standing at your side. So, obviously that didn’t happen. So it was an attempt on the part of Guaidó and López and his faction within the right-wing opposition to try to create greater divisions within the military. It was obviously that he did not have that support. What had happened was, they had a handful of lower-ranking officers from the National Guard. They had one general from the military intelligence service. But they did not have the core within the Army or the Navy or the Air Force. They tried to leverage that. It failed. It failed miserably. And here we are, once again, with a crisis scenario in Venezuela.
But again, there’s two audiences here. One is an audience internal to Venezuela to assure Guaidó’s support and consolidate his support within the opposition, which was beginning to seem shaky. And the other is the audience internationally, appealing to Donald Trump, appealing to Pompeo, appealing to Iván Duque, appealing to Bolsonaro. So there’s two audiences that Guaidó was directed at yesterday. The internal one failed.
And today we have protest on both sides for March 1st, which again could repeat a cycle of violence. The expectation is that they will be separate marches and hopefully peaceful marches.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to Mike Pompeo. This is in an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked what the U.S. would do if Maduro arrests Guaidó, and also asked about Russia’s role in keeping Maduro in the country.
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO : I’m not going to get into specifics, but we have made very clear we would consider that a major escalation. Wolf, we’ve watched throughout the day. It’s been a long time since anyone has seen Maduro. He had an airplane on the tarmac. He was ready to leave this morning, as we understand it. And the Russians indicated he should stay. … We have made clear all along, Wolf, that Maduro is surrounded by Cubans and has been supported by Russians there in Venezuela. And we’ve told the Russians and we’ve told the Cubans that’s unacceptable.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s Mike Pompeo, Miguel Tinker Salas, saying that Maduro was ready to leave with a plane on the tarmac to fly to Cuba, but got a call from Russia and so he stayed. Is this fake news?
MIGUEL TINKER SALAS : It’s a false flag operation. Why would Maduro want to leave the country, when, by all accounts, the so-called coup had already failed?
But, yes, there is a side note to that. And that is that Guaidó has tried to provoke Maduro, trying to provoke a crisis, because under these conditions, anyone leading a coup committed an illegal act. So what Guaidó would like is Maduro to arrest him, to provoke a crisis, to escalate the scenario, and therefore create the context in which the U.S. can operate either through direct action, through a naval blockade, or through action by the part of Colombia or Brazil.
So, as I said earlier, this is an effort to provoke this crisis, to try to escalate it, because we’ve already had three separate incidents previously. Guaidó claimed he would be president on January 23rd. He wasn’t; it failed. He claimed that on February 23rd, from the border in Cúcuta, he would re-enter the country, assume the presidency. It failed. So, once again, we have Guaidó claiming that he will assume the presidency. This time it appears to have failed, as well.
And, in fact, there are criticisms within the opposition to his all-or-nothing strategy. There has to be a reflective period for the opposition to think of what they’ve done and to really consider the option, again, once again, of negotiations, rather than this idea that through military action they’re going to come to power.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about where in Caracas this coup attempt took place? And who exactly you—
MIGUEL TINKER SALAS : The coup—
AMY GOODMAN : Go ahead.
MIGUEL TINKER SALAS : The coup took place in the center of Caracas, what’s called eastern Caracas, in the Altamira corridor, the Altamira district, which has been historically the center of the opposition’s base—in Chacao, in Altamira, in Palos Grandes. They attempted to move down towards La Carlota, the air base that resides in the middle of Caracas.
Some of the military personnel that were present said they were tricked. They were told to show up to receive a medal, to receive a decoration, and they were brought to Guaidó’s side, again, by a certain number of captains and colonels of the National Guard. That’s important, because they don’t represent the core of the military. There were several lieutenants and several colonels present from intelligence, from the National Guard, but, again, not the general staff of the military, not those individuals that command bases, not those individuals that command regiments or battalions. And that was the most important thing.
But, again, what we saw was a repeat of a series of actions that have been led by Guaidó and his opposition trying to topple the government, which for the moment have seemed to fail again, and basically in the core area of support, which is the east part of Caracas.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re going to break and then come back to our discussion, and in addition to historian Miguel Tinker Salas, we’ll be joined by leading economist Jeffrey Sachs. Stay with us.

In Britain, a judge has sentenced WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to 50 weeks in jail for skipping bail in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations—charges that were eventually dropped. He was afraid he would then be extradited to the United States. Last month, British police forcibly removed Assange from the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he had taken asylum for almost seven years to fight his possible extradition to the United States. After his arrest, U.S. authorities unsealed an indictment accusing Assange of conspiring with Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning, who leaked a trove of sensitive documents to WikiLeaks—including evidence of U.S. war crimes. A London court is set to hear an extradition request by the United States on Thursday. Topics:"

Meet the Activists Occupying Venezuela’s Embassy in D.C. to Protest U.S.-Backed Attempted Coup | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/1/meet_the_activists_occupying_venezuelas_embassy,"Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : Here we are, outside the Venezuelan Embassy. Tell us who you are, who you’re with and why you’re here.
ARIEL GOLD : I’m Ariel Gold, and I’m the national co-director for CodePink. CodePink has been here—we’re going on week three—since April 14th. And we’ve been here in order to protect this embassy from takeover by Guaidó, who is Trump’s puppet. And Trump has been trying to—Trump and Elliott Abrams—to orchestrate a coup in Venezuela. And taking over this building is part of that.
AMY GOODMAN : How has the U.S. been involved with the takeover of this building? I mean, this was the embassy. It’s the embassy of the government of Venezuela. The president elected is Maduro. So what’s happened here? Where are Maduro’s people? Where is the government?
ARIEL GOLD : Well, the State Department has ordered all of the Venezuelan diplomats to leave the embassy, and they did in fact leave the embassy. But the Venezuelan government gave us permission—and we call ourselves the Embassy Protection Collective. They gave us permission to be inside this building 24/7.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you tell us who you are and why you’re here today?
KEVIN ZEESE : My name’s Kevin Zeese. I’m with Popular Resistance. I’m part of the Embassy Protection Collective. We’re here today because this embassy is under attack. The Secret Service has been coming around, taking pictures. So, I’ve been in contact with the State Department. They tell us they are going to, at some point, remove us. I asked them what are they going to charge us with. And I say, “We’re here legally. We’re not trespassing. The Venezuelan government, the elected government, allows us to be here. They gave us a key to come in. So we’re lawfully here.”
The strange thing is, if the Trump administration comes in, they’ll be the law breakers. The Vienna Convention says this is inviolate. They can’t violate this embassy. They can’t trespass. They can’t unlawfully enter. They can’t give this to the opposition. That’s not their role. Their job, under the Vienna Convention, is to protect this embassy, not to violate it. So we’re here doing the job that the Trump administration should be doing.
AMY GOODMAN : And you’re staying here day and night?
KEVIN ZEESE : We’re staying here day and night. We’re living here.
ARIEL GOLD : Living here. We are.
KEVIN ZEESE : We consider ourselves residents. We are tenants.
ARIEL GOLD : We’re making three meals a day, feeding up to a hundred people, because we have events every single evening, either educational or cultural, about all kinds of issues. And then we feed people.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you take us inside the embassy?
ARIEL GOLD : Yes. Sure.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re walking to the back of the Venezuelan Embassy. Dangling from Ariel Gold of CodePink’s backpack, it says “Guaidó Not Welcome Here.” We’re going inside.
ARIEL GOLD : Here’s the key to the building—
AMY GOODMAN : OK.
ARIEL GOLD : —that we have, under permission from the Venezuelan government.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you tell us what these—this is a baseball jersey? Magglio Ordóñez is here. Kevin, you want to explain?
KEVIN ZEESE : Álex González. They’re very—both Maduro and Chávez were baseball players. Baseball is a sport that’s very popular in Venezuela.
AMY GOODMAN : So, where are we going?
KEVIN ZEESE : Second floor. And we’ve been—people live on the second, third and fourth floors. We have our work area on the second floor.
LILY TAJ : I’m Lily. I’m with CodePink. And so, basically, in this room, we all kind of gather here. We have our community meetings here, where we discuss the plans for the next day. We have all of our meals here. And right here we have our schedule of what we—we host events every night here, so cultural events, educational events. And so, this is kind of our calendar of what we have planned out for the week.
AMY GOODMAN : If you can tell me your name and what group you’re with?
KEI PRITSKER : Yeah, my name is Kei Pritsker. I’m with the ANSWER Coalition. So, I’m here, first and foremost, as a U.S. citizen and a U.S. citizen that sees a lot of problems in this country. Right now there are 40 million people in the United States that are living in poverty. There are entire cities that don’t have clean drinking water. And right here in Washington, D.C., we see luxury condos going up every single day. And outside these condos, outside these empty condos, are homeless people sleeping in the cold. And amidst all these problems, Donald Trump has declared a war on Venezuela. Now, Venezuela has not invaded the United States. Venezuela did not foreclose on millions of homes during the 2008 financial crisis. It’s not Venezuela causing the problems here in the United States. So we have to ask ourselves why Donald Trump is siding with rich white Venezuelans halfway across the world, over poor black and brown people right here in Washington, D.C.
AMY GOODMAN : Ariel Gold.
ARIEL GOLD : We, here in the U.S., have a lot of nerve talking about “We have to go in and help the people of Venezuela.” If the U.S. were concerned with helping people, why would we be partnering with the terror government of Saudi Arabia in creating the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet? So, we don’t have to—
AMY GOODMAN : In Yemen.
ARIEL GOLD : In Yemen. So, we don’t have to look any further than that to know what U.S. motivations are, to know that this is about Venezuelan oil, and this is about the 2020 election and how Trump is trying to frame himself, against Bernie Sanders, as opposing socialism, which—to prevent humanitarian crisis, when it’s actually the U.S. that is creating humanitarian crisis, creating death in Venezuela, death in Yemen. And U.S. sanctions, unilateral sanctions, on Venezuela are deadly.
AMY GOODMAN : Kevin Zeese.
KEVIN ZEESE : I was in Venezuela last May for the re-election of President Maduro. There was actually an election. He was not a dictator. Nine million people voted. Maduro received 6 million votes. There were more than 150 international election observers, and they unanimously came out and said that it met international standards for democracy, there was no fraud, and Maduro was legitimately elected. And comparing that to Guaidó, Guaidó won second place in the National Assembly election, 24% of the vote in the second-smallest state, with a tiny political party. He got in because the top two get in. And so—
AMY GOODMAN : He got in because?
KEVIN ZEESE : The top two winners, the top two in the race, get into the legislature. So he got in, barely got into the legislature, from a tiny state, with a tiny party. And then he was elevated by Trump and Pence to be the president. He was unknown by most—
AMY GOODMAN : How?
KEVIN ZEESE : Well, the night—well, it was a process, actually, that began in January at the OAS . They had multiple meetings to try to resolve this. Leopoldo López was on from video conference. They had been working on this for early—since that long. And finally, they decided on Guaidó as their guy. And the night before that Guaidó self-appointed, Michael Pence called him and said, “We’re behind you if you do it.” As soon as Guaidó announced, Trump immediately endorsed him, got the right-wing governments in Latin America and the Western European countries to join him. Why? Because the example of an independent Venezuela is a powerful example that they don’t want to see.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re on the first floor of the Venezuelan Embassy. Aminta Zea, can you talk about what this—you’re using this space for? And describe it to us.
AMINTA ZEA : Yeah, sure thing. So, here is mainly where we have a lot of our cultural and educational events. We’ll have different speakers come out, basically every night, in order to kind of create more awareness over what is happening in Venezuela as a whole.
AMY GOODMAN : Kevin, describe this banner on the back of the first floor room of the embassy.
KEVIN ZEESE : This is President Chávez speaking to the U.N.—you can see the U.N. insignia—about the Global South and anti-imperialism. This is the famous speech where he said, “You can still smell the sulfur,” after George W. Bush had left. And expect that the opposition will be painting this over.
AMY GOODMAN : Why are you, as a member of CodePink, Ariel Gold, so invested in Venezuela?
ARIEL GOLD : Well, I see all of these issues connected, whether it’s the U.S.'s relationship with Saudi Arabia, whether it's U.S. support for Israel’s ongoing occupation. These are all issues where the U.S. is pushing imperialism across the world and creating situations that are harmful to the very people that live in those places. And this is like—this is really history in the making here. We’re here at this incredible moment in time where history is being made, and we’ve realized that there’s something that we can do.

On Capitol Hill, a 35-year-old lawyer and activist who’s dying of terminal ALS testified Tuesday at an historic, first-of-its-kind congressional hearing on Medicare for all. Ady Barkan spoke to the House Rules Committee using a computerized system that tracks his eye movements and turns them into spoken words. In his emotional testimony, Barkan described how, even with a comparatively good health insurance plan, he still pays about $9,000 a month for medical care.
Ady Barkan : “All of us need medical care. And yet, in this country, the wealthiest in the history of human civilization, we do not have an effective or fair or rational system for delivering that care. I will not belabor the point, because you and your constituents are well aware of the problems: high costs, bad outcomes, mind-boggling bureaucracy, racial disparities, bankruptcies, geographic inequities and obscene profiteering. The ugly truth is this: Healthcare is not treated as a human right in the United States of America. This fact is outrageous, and it is far past time that we change it. Saying it loud for the people in the back: Healthcare is a human right.” Topics: "

On Wednesday, the House of Commons became the first parliament in the world to declare a climate emergency. The resolution came on the heels of the recent Extinction Rebellion mass uprising that shut down Central London last month in a series of direct actions. Activists closed bridges, occupied public landmarks and even superglued themselves to buildings, sidewalks and trains to demand urgent action to combat climate change. Police arrested more than 1,000 protesters. Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn told Parliament, “We are witnessing an unprecedented upsurge of climate activism, with groups like Extinction Rebellion forcing the politicians in this building to listen. For all the dismissive and defensive column inches the processes have provoked, they are a massive and, I believe, very necessary wake-up call. Today we have the opportunity to say, 'We hear you.'” We speak with George Monbiot, British journalist, author and columnist with The Guardian. His recent piece for The Guardian is headlined “Only rebellion will prevent an ecological apocalypse.” Monbiot says capitalism “is like a gun pointed at the heart of the planet. … It will essentially, necessarily destroy our life support systems.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : We turn now to the United Kingdom. On Wednesday, the House of Commons became the first parliament in the world to declare a climate emergency. This is Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn.
JEREMY CORBYN : We have no time to waste. We are living in a climate crisis that will spiral dangerously out of control unless we take rapid and dramatic action now. This is no longer about a distant future. We’re talking about nothing less than the irreversible destruction of the environment within our lifetimes of members of this house.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Wednesday’s resolution is largely symbolic and has no direct consequences for policy. But it comes on the heels of the recent Extinction Rebellion mass uprising that shut down Central London last month in a series of direct actions. Activists closed bridges, occupied public landmarks and even superglued themselves to buildings, sidewalks and trains to demand urgent action to combat climate change. Police arrested more than a thousand protesters.
AMY GOODMAN : For more, we’re joined by Guardian columnist and author George Monbiot. His most recent book, Out of the Wreckage: A New Politics for an Age of Crisis . His recent piece for The Guardian headlined “Only rebellion will prevent an ecological apocalypse.”
George, welcome back to Democracy Now! Talk about the significance of this vote.
GEORGE MONBIOT : It is highly significant, because it provides leverage for people like myself, for people like Extinction Rebellion, the youth climate strikers, to actually say, “Well, now you MPs, you members of Parliament, have declared a climate emergency; you have to act on it.” And, of course, it’s not clear that they’ve completely thought through the implications of this. I mean, on the same day, yesterday, that this climate emergency was declared, there was a legal ruling saying a third runway at Heathrow Airport can go ahead. Well, look, this is an emergency. And that means we need to start retiring fossil fuel-based infrastructure rather than building more of it. So, what we can now do is to say to members of Parliament, “You’ve agreed to this. Now you’ve got to follow through. You’ve actually got to work this through, see what the implications are, and respond accordingly.”
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, can you talk about, George Monbiot, what kinds of effects you think this—I mean, obviously, it’s not binding and has no effect on policy, but Jeremy Corbyn and Parliament’s decision to declare a climate catastrophe could, with the combination of activist pressure, lead to some kind of change. You have cited Jeremy Lent and his idea of an ecological civilization. What would that take?
GEORGE MONBIOT : Yes. So, this is one of several very important ideas which are coming forward at the moment for really looking at how we can replace our whole political economy with a new system, because it’s very clear now: Capitalism is broken. It is like a gun pointed at the heart of the planet. And it’s got these characteristics which mean that it will essentially, necessarily destroy our life support systems. Among those characteristics are the drive for perpetual economic growth on a finite planet. You just can’t support that ecologically. Things fall apart. It also says, well, anyone has got a right to buy as much natural wealth as their money allows, which means that people are just grabbing far more natural wealth than either the population as a whole or the planet itself can support. And so we need to start looking at a completely new basis for running our economies. And one of the many excellent ideas out there is Jeremy Lent’s proposal for an ecological civilization, put forward in his excellent book, The Patterning Instinct .
AMY GOODMAN : Let me ask you about Extinction Rebellion, George Monbiot, more than a thousand people arrested in a two-week period. That’s just wrapped up in London and other places, people supergluing themselves to Shell’s headquarters, for example, there. You had the climate negotiator, one of the people who helped craft the Paris climate agreement of 2015, well-respected attorney; she herself said then, “We make laws, now we break laws,” supergluing herself and being arrested.
GEORGE MONBIOT : It’s an extraordinary thing that has happened. Extinction Rebellion is an extremely well-organized group. They’ve got some great strategies for bringing these existential issues right front and center of the public mind, which is where they belong. And they’ve done so through some very clever and cheeky and disruptive actions, but have managed to swing a huge amount of public support towards them. Sometimes civil disobedience alienates more people than it attracts. But in this case, there has been a very significant move towards a public awareness of climate breakdown and a public desire to do something about it.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re going to break and come back to this discussion. We’re speaking to the British journalist, columnist, author George Monbiot. Stay with us.
[break]
AMY GOODMAN : “Shout to the Top” by The Style Council. This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : I want to turn to 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who joined Extinction Rebellion protesters last month in London.
GRETA THUNBERG : We are now facing an existential crisis, the climate crisis and ecological crisis, which have never been treated as crisis before. They have been ignored for decades. And for way too long, the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything at all to fight the climate crisis and the ecological crisis. But we will make sure that they will not get away with it any longer.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : So, still with us, George Monbiot, British journalist and author. He’s a columnist with The Guardian . So, George Monbiot, can you respond? Tell us the significance of these school strikes that Greta launched, their possible influence on the British Parliament’s vote, and also what you’ve said about the media coverage of climate change and how that’s affected public perceptions of this crisis?
GEORGE MONBIOT : Yeah. Well, the school strikes, alongside Extinction Rebellion, have changed everything in this country and, indeed, in many other parts of the world. They have suddenly galvanized public opinion and public action, and they have forced the media to cover this issue, which it has been massively neglected for many years. I mean, for 30-odd years I’ve been banging my head against a wall, saying, “Look, these are the issues that count. Climate breakdown, environmental breakdown are far more important than the economy.” The economy, like everything else, cannot survive without our life support systems. And yet, if they’re covered at all, they’re relegated to a tiny footnote.
There was a recent survey done by Deloitte of the major broadcasters in the U.K., and they found that the word “pizza” was mentioned 10 times as often as “climate change” last year, and “chocolate” was mentioned 30 times as often, which gives you some idea of our priorities in this country.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, you wrote an article , George, in December, about how U.S. billionaires are fueling extreme right-wing causes in the U.K. Do those causes include climate change? And what is the nature of this influence?
GEORGE MONBIOT : So, we have now this shift of the Koch brothers and others operating not just in the U.S., but elsewhere. They have been funding in this country a magazine called Spiked , which has a long record of dismissing the environmental crisis, dismissing the climate crisis, attacking campaigners, including Greta Thunberg, with this vicious, horrible attack, basically attacking her for being autistic, for having Asperger’s, and in the most disgusting way. And it doesn’t make sense, until you realize, “Oh, yes, they’re funded by the Koch brothers.”
And, you know, for a long time, obviously, billionaires have been controlling the media in one way or another. In most cases, you have to be a billionaire to own a newspaper or television station. And what billionaires want is the opposite to what most of the world needs. But now we see them infiltrating organizations they don’t necessarily own, but funding them and ensuring that their agenda is followed.
AMY GOODMAN : George Monbiot, actually, people should go to Greta’s conversation that we had with her in Poland at the U.N. climate summit, where she talks about Asperger’s, having it, and how it makes her single-focused and seeing things in black and white. Really interesting. People should go to democracynow.org.
But in this last minute we have, if you can talk about the broader effects of the parliamentary announcement, what it means around the world? I mean, you have the situation, for example, where the effects of climate change are already being felt, particularly in the Global South. Indonesia has announced it plans to relocate its capital away from Jakarta, home to 10 million people, as the city is threatened by one-two punch of subsiding land and rising seas due to climate change. In this last minute, talk about that and what this means for the world.
GEORGE MONBIOT : Yes. Well, for so long, the rich world has benefited from the burning of fossil fuels while the poor world is having to pay the price. And we’re now seeing this come home to roost. So, all rich nations need to declare a climate emergency and then act on that by leaving fossil fuels in the ground, by retiring fossil fuel-dependent infrastructure and by completely changing the basis of their economies.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, we want to thank you so much for being with us, George Monbiot, British journalist and author, columnist with The Guardian , most recent book Out of the Wreckage: A New Politics for an Age of Crisis . We’ll link to your piece in The Guardian , “Only rebellion will prevent an ecological apocalypse.” He was speaking to us from Reading, England.

A Debate on Maduro: Two Venezuelans Oppose U.S. Intervention But Differ on Steps Ahead,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/2/a_debate_on_maduro_two_venezuelans,"sociologist speaking to us from Caracas, Venezuela, where he’s part of the Citizen’s Platform in Defense of the Constitution. Lander is a retired professor at the Central University of Venezuela. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : We begin today’s show in Venezuela, where competing pro- and anti-government rallies were held Wednesday. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro accused the United States of backing Tuesday’s failed coup led by opposition leader Juan Guaidó. Speaking to a massive crowd of supporters outside the presidential palace of Miraflores, Maduro said the United States had been tricked into believing that several top Venezuelan officials were ready to break with his government.
PRESIDENT NICOLÁS MADURO : [translated] In this opportunity, the Venezuelan coup mongers fooled the American imperialists, making them believe that I was to give up, that I was going to hand myself in, that I was to leave the country.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : In Washington, the National Security Council held a principals’ meeting on Wednesday to discuss Venezuela. The Washington Post reports the staff of national security adviser John Bolton clashed with a top general during the meeting for not presenting sufficient military options on Venezuela.
AMY GOODMAN : This came as acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan canceled a planned overseas trip to focus on Venezuela. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to urge an end to Russian involvement in Venezuela. Lavrov reportedly responded by warning the United States should not take any more aggressive steps in Venezuela. On Wednesday night, President Trump appeared on Fox Business.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : It’s a terrible thing. People are starving. People are dying. There’s no food. There’s no water. It’s just a terrible situation. You see what’s going on. And we’re doing everything we can do, short of, you know, the ultimate. And there are people that would like to do—have us do the ultimate. But we are—we are—we have a lot of options open. But when we look at what’s going on there, it’s an incredible mess.
AMY GOODMAN : We go now to Caracas, Venezuela, where we’re joined by two guests. Carlos Ron is the Venezuelan vice-minister of foreign relations for North America. Edgardo Lander is a Venezuelan sociologist who’s part of the Citizen’s Platform in Defense of the Constitution. Lander is a retired professor at Central University in Venezuela.
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Let’s begin with Carlos Ron. The reports in the United States were that a plane was at the ready on the tarmac for President Maduro to flee Venezuela to Cuba, but he got a call from Russia that told him to stay. Can you tell us what the truth is and if you see this as a failed coup that’s over?
CARLOS RON : Well, thank you very much for the invitation.
First of all, I think this version from Washington is ridiculous, because I think President Maduro has made it clear that he’s not going to betray the will of Venezuelan people and just leave the country because of U.S. pressure. But also, it’s a wide misunderstanding of Venezuelan politics and of Venezuelan reality to think that, you know, he’s ready to get on a plane, but then he gets a call from Russia, and then that’s what stops him. I think it’s just a pretext from the failed U.S. policy here.
What is clear is that the United States is clearly and blatantly promoting a coup d’état in Venezuela, from every high-ranking official, from people in Congress like Marco Rubio, Bolton, Pompeo, etc. And, you know, during the whole day of the coup attempt, they were tweeting and threatening the Venezuelan military and asking the Venezuelan military to join them. There was clearly an intent. I think they have been fooled by their counterparts here, by their advisers, or by the people in the opposition who they speak to here, into believing that this is an easy thing to accomplish. And then, just to save face and not face the repercussions, they make up this story about Russia involvement or Cuban involvement and whatsoever. I mean, this is a—we’re a government run on behalf of the people of Venezuela, who elected us and who gave us their trust. And we’re going to keep—President Maduro is going to keep defending his position and the constitution.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, among the many statements that Trump administration officials have made, national security adviser John Bolton, who has made several statements, but among them, he has publicly claimed that three key Venezuelan officials had abandoned an agreement to leave the Maduro government. On Tuesday, Bolton tweeted a video in which he named the three officials.
JOHN BOLTON : It’s particularly important now that all of you speak to those in the military and the regime who can make a difference, to Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino, to Chief Judge of the Supreme Court Maikel Moreno and Commander of the Presidential Guard Rafael Hernández Dala. These are three people who agreed with Juan Guaidó to transfer power from Nicolás Maduro to the interim president. They need to act. Everybody who supports freedom for Venezuela needs to tell them to act now. Victory is within your grasp.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : So, I’d like to ask Edgardo Lander: Can you respond to that and the number of statements that have come from Trump administration officials about what’s happening in Venezuela and urging people in Venezuela to follow Guaidó?
EDGARDO LANDER : Good morning, Amy.
AMY GOODMAN : And Nermeen.
EDGARDO LANDER : Of course, I have no direct access to judge these statements, but it’s obvious that this is just a continuation of this attempt by the U.S. government, by these neocons and hawks that are leading U.S. foreign policy in relation to Venezuela, and that they really have no problem making up whatever story they find is convenient in order to justify their actions. Obviously, there are some people in the current administration that want a military intervention in Venezuela. They want a regime change. And they don’t really need any excuse for that. They’re just making up stories to justify this intervention and try to convince people within the United States, try to convince people within the U.S. military, that find this to be a really dangerous adventure, and, of course, opposition on Capitol Hill.
AMY GOODMAN : How do you explain, Edgardo Lander, that it’s both Democrats and Republicans that are opposing Maduro? I mean, there are many progressive Venezuelans, as well, who are extremely critical of Maduro. You have the Human Rights Watch and Amnesty reports that have come out. I think one of the reports is titled, let’s see—”one of the reports”:https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/02/venezuela-hunger-punishment-and-fear-the-formula-for-repression-used-by-authorities-under-nicolas-maduro/ being titled “Fear and repression”—”Venezuela: Hunger, punishment and fear, the formula for repression used by authorities under Nicolás Maduro.” Enormous frustration with the elected president, Maduro, but also the horror that the U.S. is threatening war, like this comment from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking on Fox Business.
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO : The president has been crystal clear and incredibly consistent. Military action is possible. If that’s what’s required, that’s what the United States will do. We’re trying to do everything we can to avoid violence. We have asked all the parties involved not to engage in that kind of activity. We’d prefer a peaceful transition of government there, where Maduro leaves and a new election is held. But the president has made clear, in the event that there comes a moment—and we’ll all have to make decisions about when that moment is, and the president will ultimately have to make that decision—he is prepared to do that, if that’s what’s required.
AMY GOODMAN : So, you have the reports of the National Security Council in the United States, the rage of the Bolton people, attacking a U.S. general for not coming up with more military options. You have Pompeo saying the U.S. is ready to go to war in Venezuela. But then you have, Edgardo Lander, progressives in Venezuela, as well, saying that Maduro has failed in leading Venezuela, that the country is in an absolute catastrophe.
EDGARDO LANDER : Well, that’s true. I am part of what could be called the critical left in Venezuela, that has been quite critical of the Maduro government for some time. We think that the Maduro government has completely failed. It has led to an incredible social and humanitarian crisis in the country. We have had a collapse of the economy. The economy today is 50% of what it used to be just five years ago. Oil production is about a fourth of what it used to be some five, six years ago. The government has increasingly gone beyond the constitution, and its main priority seems to be to remain in power no matter what. And it’s obvious that we need a transition.
The problem is how we have a transition. If we have the U.S. policy and Guaidó’s policy, this would mean a violent transition. This would mean civil war. This would mean a U.S. intervention. I belong to a small collective called the Citizen’s Platform in Defense of the Constitution, and we have been arguing for some time with other groups that what we need is some form of negotiation that would lead to asking the Venezuelan people what they want. We are asking for a consultive referendum in which people would be given a chance to decide if they want to continue with this government, if they want to continue with the National Assembly or if they want to open up the means to a democratic, electoral transition that’s defined by the Venezuelan people, not by U.S. pressure, not by U.S. sanctions, not by U.S. intervention, but a decision that should be in the hands of the Venezuelan people.
Both sides claim that they have a majority. Both sides are unwilling to even start any serious talks or negotiations. And yesterday’s activities, yesterday’s and the day before’s activities, just show the extreme to which both sides are pressing in order to avoid any negotiation. Every time there seems to be a chance of some talks that would lead to a negotiation, that would look forward to a nonviolent solution, then there’s a very active decision by one of the sides to blockade this possibility. I think the United States is doing everything possible to make it impossible to have a negotiation, because what they want is a rendition of Maduro. And this simply is not possible. We have a situation in which the two sides are at this moment forgetting politics as such. Both sides refuse to recognize the other side. And this is a warlike situation. It’s a situation in which both sides attempt to exterminate the other side. And this is certainly not possible in Venezuela today.
We have a confrontation between two sides that have a lot of power. On one side, one has the Maduro government. Maduro has the control of the state. He has the backing of the armed forces. And he has the backing of a sector of the population in Venezuela, which today is a minority—obviously it’s a minority, but it’s still there. This is something that’s seen from outside Venezuela, especially from right media. They simply refuse to recognize the fact that for a certain proportion of the Venezuelan popular sectors, there’s still some very active backing for the Maduro government. On the other side, we have Guaidó, who has become the most popular leader in the country today. He has backing of the—today, I can say that it’s the majority of the Venezuelan population. But its main strength, obviously, is not internal, but it is U.S. backing. And in this confrontation, unless there is a negotiation, there is a very, very high risk of a civil war, of very violent outcomes. And the United States, as you have said, has repeatedly insisted that the military option is on the table.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : So, Carlos Ron, you are a senior member of the Maduro government, Venezuelan vice-minister of foreign relations for North America. Can you respond to what Edgardo said and what you think explains the precipitous collapse of so many aspects of Venezuelan governing structures, from the economy to public services, and most of this having occurred while Maduro has been in power?
CARLOS RON : Well, for sure, I have some disagreements with Edgardo, of course. I respect him. But that’s the whole point. I mean, we can have disagreements as Venezuelans, and that’s what this is about. You know, we need to solve our differences politically—and, in that, I agree with Edgardo—through dialogue, through politics, and not through violence. What we are seeing from the side of Guaidó and that group of extreme opposition leaders is really a call for another coup and a call for a violent overthrow the government and the invitation for a United States intervention. That’s what’s really more dangerous.
I think, you know, you see how U.S. officials are so committed to politics in Venezuela, and it’s obvious, because it does play into internal politics in the United States. I mean, there’s a reason why both sides of the aisle sort of go to the Venezuela issue, because they want the votes in Florida that they could get. Florida is a key state for the 2020 election. And when you have also candidates in the U.S. speaking about socialism, you see—democratic socialism or whatever you want to call it, but you see how the current administration is trying to downplay that by showing Venezuela as an example of a failed social experiment.
What they don’t take into account is that a lot of the problems that we have been having—and nobody can deny them—is the effects of sanctions and other measures taken by the United States against our government. I mean, there’s a financial blockade currently going on right now where at least about $6 billion are stuck in banks, where we can’t even make transactions to make basic purchases for food, medicine and supplies that we need to make the economy move forward and so forth. I mean, this is not fake; this is a reality. It’s so a reality that, about last week, when we were in New York, in the United Nations, the Department of State issued a fact sheet on their policies in Venezuela. And it was taken offline the very next morning, because as the key outcomes of U.S. policy in Venezuela, they put things such as Guaidó being interim president, $3.2 million being blocked in banks and in—we disagree with the amount, but just the fact that they were saying that this is an accomplishment of U.S. policy—the drop in oil production. I mean, there’s a recognition that there is an intent in U.S. policies to hinder the Venezuelan government’s capability of dealing with national problems. You know, we’re bound to have economic problems. That’s not something unheard of in a developing country. But there’s definitely an intent to make—to weaken government policies, to weaken the government, and to produce and take this to a regime change possibility.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Carlos Ron, could you clarify, though, first of all, whether you agree with Edgardo that, internally, a negotiated transition is needed, given the situation in Venezuela and Maduro’s unpopularity? I mean, Edgardo said that Guaidó is today the politician who is most popular among the Venezuelan people.
CARLOS RON : I disagree with Edgardo on that point, because I believe that if he were the most popular politician in Venezuela, he wouldn’t need the U.S. backing to come out to the streets and do what he’s doing. What I agree with him is in the fact that I think problems of Venezuelans have to be solved by Venezuelans and have to be solved in politics, not with violence, not with attempted coups. But, you know, we have a constitution. We have means of—we need to sit down and find different formulas to solve our problems.
We have disagreements on how we see—I mean, I support President Maduro, and I believe that our politics are the way we should go. And he has an other opinion. And I think, as Venezuelans, in a democracy, that’s what you do. You have differences of opinions, and then you try to play them out. But you don’t try to do this through violence, and you don’t try to do this through U.S. intervention. That’s a key point here. Whatever problems we have as Venezuelans, whatever differences, we have to work them out, first of all, amongst Venezuelans and, second of all, through the democratic mechanisms that there are.
AMY GOODMAN : I’d like to talk about the U.S. media coverage of the crisis in Venezuela over the last several months. In a piece published Tuesday, the media watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, known as FAIR , found the mainstream corporate media here in the United States did not publish even one opinion piece opposing regime change in Venezuela. The FAIR piece is headlined “Zero Percent of Elite Commentators Oppose Regime Change in Venezuela.” One example FAIR cited is a New York Times opinion piece published last month headlined “What My Fellow Liberals Don’t Get About Venezuela.” The video features Venezuelan-American comedian and writer Joanna Hausmann. Let’s go to a clip.
JOANNA HAUSMANN : Juan Guaidó is not an American right-wing puppet leading an illegitimate coup, but a social democrat appointed by the National Assembly, the only remaining democratically elected institution left in Venezuela. Guaidó’s job is to ensure free and fair elections, because—news flash—the last election was not free or fair.
AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times did not point out that Joanna’s father, Ricardo Hausmann, is a close ally of opposition leader Juan Guaidó and was appointed by Guaidó to serve as Venezuela’s representative to the Inter-American Development Bank. Edgardo Lander, could you talk about the media coverage and what that means?
EDGARDO LANDER : Well, it’s obvious that the corporate media has been following U.S. policy. And this isn’t new. I mean, it happened during the Iraq War. It’s happened in Libya. It’s happened in all over the place. The papers like The New York Times turn to be critical after the facts. Maybe 10 years from now, they’ll be critical of their position in relation to what’s happening in Venezuela.
But I also think that it’s important to recognize that the problems in Venezuela are not black and white. It’s not an issue of the democratic government, presented by Maduro, and some fascist opposition. The problems are much more complicated. And I think that one has to take into account that the serious economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela is mainly due to the incapacity and corruption of the Maduro government.
It’s true that over the last two years U.S. sanctions has become a really critical, important issue—the fact that there’s a financial blockade, the fact that Venezuela has been highly dependent on oil exports and import from the United States has that—at this moment blockaded, the fact that Venezuela has no access to foreign credit, the fact that the central bank has been prohibited in dealing with dollars. I mean, there’s a whole range of sanctions that is having a huge impact on the Venezuelan economy.
But this has been happening mainly during the Trump administration, and this is from August 2017. But the economic crisis in Venezuela started way before that. The decay of the Venezuelan GDP , the decay of public services, the lowering of living standards, the limited access to what used to be the main achievements of Venezuelan process during the first decade are all things that were happening before the sanctions.
So we have a combination of a very incompetent government, an extremely corrupt government, an increasingly authoritarian government, on one side, and on the other side, we have this opposition, backed by the United States, with this constant threat of intervention. So we need to find a solution in which there is a possibility for the Venezuelan people to have a say and decide what they want for their country in a nonviolent way.
AMY GOODMAN : How do you envision that happening, Edgardo?
EDGARDO LANDER : The government has used the—
AMY GOODMAN : How do you envision that happening? You have these protests in the streets right now. You have people on both sides, even if this particular coup attempt has failed—and would you say, Edgardo, it has failed? How do you see this dialogue going across the political spectrum?
EDGARDO LANDER : Even though they claim now that there was no coup attempt, obviously there was a coup attempt. Guaidó himself called it a coup, coup in process. And it failed. And it just shows, in my perspective, that the Venezuelan population doesn’t want a violent solution. It doesn’t want a solution that is through a coup, through a military coup, and it does not want U.S. intervention.
There is always some talks going on, always sort of underground, backstage. And every time there’s something like the coup attempt this week, this attempt to have some sort of negotiation, some sort of alternative that’s not violent, that’s in the hands of Venezuelans, is once again postponed, because both sides then sort of back to their really rigid position and really try to maintain whatever power they have.
It’s extremely necessary to have a situation in which both sides recognize that they can’t defeat the other side. There’s no way that the Venezuelan government can survive 'til the end of the Maduro government, in terms of his 6-year period, because the economy is collapsing. People are in a really dramatic situation. It's almost 4 million people that have left the country. This is an incredible political statement. People really can’t stand the situation anymore, and there has to be an alternative. But this alternative can’t be a coup. It can’t be a U.S. intervention. It can’t be violence.
AMY GOODMAN : Carlos Ron, I wanted to ask you about the embassy right now in Washington, D.C. We’re about to play a clip. We took a tour of it the other day. Activists, really American activists, are in charge of it right now. You, the Venezuelan government, gave them the keys. Can you explain why the Maduro government, why your government, has left the U.S. Embassy in Washington, D.C.?
CARLOS RON : Well, we have—we broke relations with the United States on January 23rd. And then, out of the process of that, we have—our diplomatic staff has left the embassy. However, it is Venezuelan property. It’s the property of the Venezuelan state. And we have allowed, as our guests, a collective of social movements that have used the space to meet and to speak about different issues of their concern, and because they themselves wanted to also make a statement that—against intervention in Venezuela and against the violation of international law, because, if you recall, a few weeks ago, there was a forceful entry into the consulate of Venezuela in New York and in two other buildings that are owned by the Venezuelan state, and they were given to the representatives of Guaidó, which is a violation of the Vienna Convention, Article 45 of the Vienna Convention, that says, even if two states break relations, there has to be respect for the premises. There has to be—the premises of the missions are inviolable. So, they need to be protected, and they were handed over illegally to the Venezuelan opposition.
AMY GOODMAN : Carlos Ron, we’re about to go into that embassy in a minute, but we just have a minute before we lose the satellite feed. Can you tell us what is the involvement of Russia right now in Venezuela?
CARLOS RON : Oh, we have a relation with Russia like we have a relationship with other countries such as China and other countries that we have established treaties. And, you know, thanks to foment—promoting development in Venezuela, I mean, the relationship is one of friendship and is one of cooperation. And that’s it. This isn’t the way it’s been portrayed by U.S. authorities as if, you know, there’s any other type of influence on the Venezuelan government. It’s the people of Venezuela who decide, through its elected leaders, what Venezuela does.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, we want to thank you both very much for being with us, Carlos Ron, Venezuelan vice-minister of foreign relations for North America, speaking to us from Caracas, and Edgardo Lander, a sociologist in Venezuela, where he’s part of the Citizen’s Platform in Defense of the Constitution, retired professor at Central University of Venezuela in Caracas.
This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . On Tuesday, we went down to Washington, D.C., where we met with activists who are occupying the Venezuelan Embassy. The Venezuelan government has left the building, but they gave their keys to these activists. They are demanding, the activists are, that the Trump administration cancel plans to turn the embassy over to Venezuelan opposition leaders. This is Ariel Gold with CodePink.
AMY GOODMAN : Here we are, outside the Venezuelan Embassy. Tell us who you are, who you’re with and why you’re here.
ARIEL GOLD : I’m Ariel Gold, and I’m the national co-director for CodePink. CodePink has been here—we’re going on week three—since April 14th. And we’ve been here in order to protect this embassy from takeover by Guaidó, who is Trump’s puppet. And Trump has been trying to—Trump and Elliott Abrams—to orchestrate a coup in Venezuela. And taking over this building is part of that.
AMY GOODMAN : How has the U.S. been involved with the takeover of this building? I mean, this was the embassy. It’s the embassy of the government of Venezuela. The president elected is Maduro. So what’s happened here? Where are Maduro’s people? Where is the government?
ARIEL GOLD : Well, the State Department has ordered all of the Venezuelan diplomats to leave the embassy, and they did in fact leave the embassy. But the Venezuelan government gave us permission—and we call ourselves the Embassy Protection Collective. They gave us permission to be inside this building 24/7.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you tell us who you are and why you’re here today?
KEVIN ZEESE : My name’s Kevin Zeese. I’m with Popular Resistance. I’m part of the Embassy Protection Collective. We’re here today because this embassy is under attack. The Secret Service has been coming around, taking pictures. So, I’ve been in contact with the State Department. They tell us they are going to, at some point, remove us. I asked them what are they going to charge us with. And I say, “We’re here legally. We’re not trespassing. The Venezuelan government, the elected government, allows us to be here. They gave us a key to come in. So we’re lawfully here.”
The strange thing is, if the Trump administration comes in, they’ll be the law breakers. The Vienna Convention says this is inviolate. They can’t violate this embassy. They can’t trespass. They can’t unlawfully enter. They can’t give this to the opposition. That’s not their role. Their job, under the Vienna Convention, is to protect this embassy, not to violate it. So we’re here doing the job that the Trump administration should be doing.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you take us inside the embassy?
ARIEL GOLD : Yes. Sure.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re walking to the back of the Venezuelan Embassy. Dangling from Ariel Gold of CodePink’s backpack, it says “Guaidó Not Welcome Here.” We’re going inside.
ARIEL GOLD : Here’s the key to the building—
AMY GOODMAN : OK.
ARIEL GOLD : —that we have, under permission from the Venezuelan government.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you tell us what these—this is a baseball jersey? Magglio Ordóñez is here. Kevin, you want to explain?
KEVIN ZEESE : Álex González. They’re very—both Maduro and Chávez were baseball players. Baseball is a sport that’s very popular in Venezuela.
AMY GOODMAN : So, where are we going?
KEVIN ZEESE : Second floor.
AMY GOODMAN : Kevin Zeese.
KEVIN ZEESE : I was in Venezuela last May for the re-election of President Maduro. There was actually an election. He was not a dictator. Nine million people voted. Maduro received 6 million votes. There were more than 150 international election observers, and they unanimously came out and said that it met international standards for democracy, there was no fraud, and Maduro was legitimately elected. And comparing that to Guaidó, Guaidó won second place in the National Assembly election, 24% of the vote in the second-smallest state, with a tiny political party. He got in because the top two get in. And so—
AMY GOODMAN : He got in because?
KEVIN ZEESE : The top two winners, the top two in the race, get into the legislature. So he got in, barely got into the legislature, from a tiny state, with a tiny party. And then he was elevated by Trump and Pence to be the president. He was unknown by most—
AMY GOODMAN : How?
KEVIN ZEESE : Well, the night—well, it was a process, actually, that began in January at the OAS . They had multiple meetings to try to resolve this. Leopoldo López was on from video conference. They had been working on this for early—since that long. And finally, they decided on Guaidó as their guy. And the night before that Guaidó self-appointed, Michael Pence called him and said, “We’re behind you if you do it.” As soon as Guaidó announced, Trump immediately endorsed him, got the right-wing governments in Latin America and the Western European countries to join him. Why? Because the example of an independent Venezuela is a powerful example that they don’t want to see.
PROTESTERS : Hands off Venezuela! Hands off Venezuela! Hands off Venezuela! Hands off Venezuela!
AMY GOODMAN : That was Kevin Zeese with Popular Resistance, one of the dozens of protesters who have been occupying the Venezuelan Embassy for more than two weeks. Go to democracynow.org to hear more voices from inside the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, D.C.

Attorney General William Barr defended his handling of the Robert Mueller investigation to the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday, as Democrats accused him of working as an agent of President Trump rather than the top U.S. law enforcement official. During hours of rancorous testimony, Barr repeatedly refused to answer senators’ questions about his conclusions that President Trump did not obstruct justice in his attempts to end the Mueller investigation. This week, The Washington Post and New York Times reported that Mueller wrote to Barr in March complaining that his initial 4-page summary of the special counsel’s findings “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of Mueller’s report. This is Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal questioning Barr about Mueller’s letter.
Attorney General William Barr : “You know, the letter is a bit snitty, and I think it was probably written by one of his staff people.”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal : “Did you make a memorandum of your conversation?”
Attorney General William Barr : “Huh?”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal : “Did you make a memorandum?”
Attorney General William Barr : “No, I didn’t make a memorandum.”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal : “Or did anyone else?”
Attorney General William Barr : “What?”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal : “Did anyone, either you or anyone on your staff, memorialize your conversation with Robert Mueller?”
Attorney General William Barr : “Yes.”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal : “Who did that?”
Attorney General William Barr : “There were notes taken of the call.”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal : “May we have those notes?”
Attorney General William Barr : “No.”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal : “Why not?”
Attorney General William Barr : “Why should you have them?”
After the hearing, some lawmakers suggested Barr should be held in criminal contempt of Congress. Meanwhile, Barr said he would refuse to testify for a second day today before the House Judiciary Committee, refusing to be questioned by the committee’s lawyers. Topics:"

The bills have the support of the U.S.-backed president, Juan Orlando Hernández, but are deeply unpopular among doctors and teachers, who say they’re aimed at mass layoffs ahead of the wholesale privatization of Honduras’s education and healthcare systems.

AMY GOODMAN : We end today’s show with the words of the late folk singer and activist Pete Seeger. He was born a hundred years ago today. In 2004, Pete Seeger came into our Firehouse studio.
AMY GOODMAN : Pete Seeger, can you tell us about “We Shall Overcome”?
PETE SEEGER : I thought, in 1946, when I learned it from a white woman who taught in a union labor school, the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, that the song had been made up in 1946 by tobacco workers, because they sang it there to strike through the winter of 1946 in Charleston, South Carolina, and they taught the song to Zilphia Horton, the teacher at the labor school. And she said, “Oh, it was my favorite song.” And I printed it in our little magazine in New York, People’s Songs , as “We Will Overcome” in 1947.
It was a friend of mine, Guy Carawan, who made it famous. He picked up my way of singing it, “We Shall Overcome,” although Septima—there was another teacher there, Septima Clark, a black woman. She felt that “shall”—like me, she felt it opened up the mouth better than “will,” so that’s the way she sang it. Anyway, Guy Carawan in 1960 taught it to the young people at the founding convention of SNCC , Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, SNCC for short. And a month later, it wasn’t a song, it was the song, throughout the South.
AMY GOODMAN : You sang it for Martin Luther King?
PETE SEEGER : In 1957, I went down to Highlander. Zilphia was dead, and Myles Horton, her husband, said, “We can’t have a celebration of 25 years with this school without music. Won’t you come down and help lead some songs?” So I went down, and Dr. King and Reverend Abernathy came up from Alabama to say a few words, and I sang a few songs, and that was one of them. Anne Braden drove King to a speaking engagement in Kentucky the next day, and she remembers him sitting in the back seat, saying, “'We Shall Overcome.' That song really sticks with you, doesn’t it?” But he wasn’t the song leader. It wasn’t until another three years that Guy Carawan made it famous.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman. “Not Backing Down: Israel, Free Speech, and the Battle for Palestinian Human Rights.” That’s the title of the panel set to take place Saturday at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Three anonymous UMass students filed a lawsuit to stop the event, claiming they’ll, quote, “suffer irreparable harm” if it takes place. But Judge Robert Ullmann ruled on Thursday the event can proceed, saying, quote, “There’s nothing that comes even close to a threat of harm or incitement to violence or lawlessness.” Meanwhile, the university has backed the event despite the protests, saying it’s committed to the principles of free speech and academic freedom.
So, we are joined right now by Pink Floyd founder Roger Waters, who is one of the participants in that event.
Welcome to_Democracy Now!_
ROGER WATERS : Thank you.
AMY GOODMAN : And talk about why you’re doing this on Saturday and the significance of the court ruling.
ROGER WATERS : Well, Sut asked me to come to his university to be on this panel, and I’m delighted to be able to do it.
Thank you, Judge. He was very explicit and brief and to the point in his ruling. He’s obviously sound.
My view is that it’s a good thing that the organizations are attacking the event, because what it does is it serves to shine light on the predicament of the Palestinian people, who we support. And the more light that is shone on any question of human rights, the better, in my view. So, I’m very glad that they’ve failed, though, in a way, if they had succeeded in their legal maneuvers, that might have gone even further to shine light on the predicament of the Palestinians, which is what this is about.
You know, something that I say at every show I do now, because I fine my speeches down so they’re very short, is, at some point in everybody’s life, they have to decide whether or not they believe in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Paris. If you do—either you believe in it or you don’t; you can’t have it both ways. And so, if you do believe it, then you have to stand up for people’s human rights all over the world, irrespective of their ethnicity or their religion or their nationality, which is what we are doing in this panel at the University of Massachusetts on Saturday.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the backlash against pro-Palestinian voices, including the backlash that you, Roger Waters, have experienced, as a musician, as a human rights activist, as you travel the world?
ROGER WATERS : Well, this particular issue is far more divisive than any other. So, I’ve just been on tour for a couple of years all over the world. And in many countries, certainly in Europe, in France and in Germany, I came up against an absolute wall of silence, really, particularly in Germany, where nobody in the press, until I spoke to one journalist with a newspaper from Munich—nobody would speak to me, on the grounds that they had been told that I was anti-Semitic and that I could not be spoken to. And the Germans are very sensitive about Jewish affairs, and, in consequence, they are not open to even speaking—even speaking about human rights within the context of Palestine.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the equation of being critical of the Israeli government with anti-Semitism?
ROGER WATERS : Well, I could talk about it, yeah, but what’s the point? So much—
AMY GOODMAN : Respond to it.
ROGER WATERS : OK. Well, it’s—quite clearly, criticism of any government is nothing to do with anti-Semitism, and certainly criticism of the Israeli government’s flouting of international law and abuses of human rights has nothing to do with the Jewish faith or Jewish people. I’ve had lots of meetings, all over the world, with JVP -sponsored events.
AMY GOODMAN : Jewish Voice for Peace.
ROGER WATERS : Actually, we did one in—the first one we did after I left the States was in Vancouver. And it wasn’t JVP , but it was another Jewish organization, Jewish—I can’t remember, something other than Voices. And, of course, they are just as humane and care just as much about human rights as everybody else does who cares about human rights. Unfortunately, the Israeli government does not care about human rights, and neither does this government in this country, which is why this administration is supporting the annexing of the Golan Heights and the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and all the rest of it. So, it is very important that those of us who do care organize, meet, have meetings and continue to protest the situation of our Palestinian friends.
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to bring Rachel Weber back into this conversation to address this particular issue of equating being critical of the state of Israel, of the current government in Israel, with being anti-Semitic. You’re an attorney and member of Jewish Voice for Peace.
RACHEL WEBER : Yes. Zionism is a political movement. And from the very beginning of that movement in the late 19th century, there’s been dissent within Jewish communities around whether or not Zionism was a good idea. And, in fact, right around when the Balfour Declaration was about to be enacted, which gave a mandate for—essentially, that was the beginnings of the establishment of the state of Israel through the British mandate, there were several prominent Jewish members of the British Jewish community that issued a statement in The Times of London about how this was a dangerous idea. So, there’s been discussion and debate and disagreement about Zionism from the very beginning within Jewish communities.
So, to say that all Jews feel that Israel—the Israeli government speaks for them is—again, it’s inaccurate, and it’s incredibly offensive. I have an absolute obligation to protest injustices that are happening in my name, both as a Jew and as an American, given the amount of aid and military resources that this country gives to Israel. It’s actually quite offensive to suggest that just because of the—just because of the identities of the people who are running the government in Israel, that because I share some heritage with those people’s identities, that I would support anything that they do. And there’s a growing voice in this country and around the world of Jews saying Israel does not speak for us, and we have to speak up against the human rights abuses that are happening against Palestinians.
And to say that any criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic, it’s incredibly dangerous. And it’s actually bad for Jews, because it prevents us from doing the hard work that has to happen to contest white supremacy. White supremacy is what is dangerous for Jews in this country and around the world. And when we use a definition of anti-Semitism that includes criticism of Israel, that actually divides us from—internally. It’s a huge divide within the Jewish community in this country. And it also separates us from allies, in working together to fight white supremacy. So, it’s actually—it’s dangerous, obviously, for Palestinians, because it makes anyone who stands up for Palestinian rights fear that they’re going to be accused of being anti-Semitic and smeared, just like in this lawsuit. And it’s also dangerous for Jews, because it prevents us from working together internally and with allies to fight white supremacy.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to bring in Sut Jhally again from the University of Massachusetts, a professor of communications, head of the Media Education Foundation. According to reports, you had hoped to bring the Palestinian leader and activist Hanan Ashrawi, but she didn’t receive a visa in time. Is this true? And what do you understand happened?
SUT JHALLY : Yes, it’s very true. Again, when I was organizing the event, I sent an invitation to Hanan Ashrawi, and she replied and said she very much wanted to come, but she was waiting for a visa, and that she will be back in touch with me, you know, if she got the visa. And she got back in touch with me about two months later and said that she could not include the United States in anything she was going to do, because she was not receiving a visa. And so, you know, Hanan has been coming to the United States for decades. And I don’t know if people know, but she’s a famed Palestinian legislator, an elected representative of the Palestinian people. And she cannot now come into the country to talk about the issues that confront Palestinians. And this goes along with, just two weeks ago, Marwan [ sic ] Barghouti, the founder—the co-founder of BDS , was denied a visa to come in.
So, I think this is—I think what is happening at UMass is a kind of microcosm of what’s happening everywhere. There is this kind of intense pressure now to make sure that the pro-Palestinian voices or any kind of rational discussion of Israel-Palestine does not happen. At UMass, it’s to do with—you know, it’s the phone calls. It’s the letters that came in. It’s the lawsuit. And I think this is an act of desperation on their part. For example, they knew the injunction would never—would never stop this event from taking place. And so, the question is: Why did they go through with it? Why did they spend the thousands of dollars on the lawyers to go through the courts? And I think that it was not an attempt to stop this event, because they knew they couldn’t. It was an act of intimidation and bullying for the next one, to tell people, “If you start to think about organizing events around this or start speaking out about this, this is what’s going to come down on you.”
And I think they’re petrified. I think they are terrified of the coalitions that have been building between Palestinian students and Jewish students in organizations like Students for Justice in Palestine. They’re terrified of the links that are taking place between the battle for black liberation in the United States and battle for liberation in Palestine. And they want to destroy those and make sure that those voices are not heard, through intimidation and threat.
But the name of our panel is called “Not Backing Down,” because I think we’re in a new moment right now where there is a space for different kinds of voices to come through, and people are not backing down and are forcing this conversation into the mainstream.
AMY GOODMAN : That was actually Omar Barghouti, one of the organizers of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement, who was not allowed into the United States, despite the fact that he’s come here many other times and was also coming for his daughter’s wedding. People can see the interview we did with him at democracynow.org.
We also recently spoke to Noam Chomsky, the world-renowned political dissident, linguist and author. He said Democrats are supporting Palestinian rights more now than in the past. He said times have changed.
NOAM CHOMSKY : The support for Israeli expansionism, repression, the whole alliance that’s developing, that support has shifted in the United States from the more liberal sectors—roughly, the Democratic Party—to the far right. Not very long ago, support for Israel was based passionately in the liberal sectors of the population. It was a Democratic issue. It isn’t anymore. In fact, if you look in the polls, people who identify themselves as Democrats by now tend to support Palestinian rights more than Israel. That’s a dramatic change. Support for Israel now is in the most reactionary parts of the population: evangelical Christians, ultranationalists. Basically, it’s a far-right issue. Among younger people, this is even more the case.
AMY GOODMAN : That was Noam Chomsky, who had just returned to Boston, to Massachusetts. I was interviewing him at the Old South Church there. About a thousand people packed into the church. Roger Waters, do you feel that kind of optimism? I mean, here, Noam Chomsky has been so critical of the Israeli state for so long, and yet he says he feels there is a different climate right now.
ROGER WATERS : Absolutely. I mean, I’ve been involved in this struggle only for the last 12 years. But over those 12 years it has changed dramatically. And Noam Chomsky is exactly right. And so is Sut. They are desperate now. That’s why they pulled this silly legal stunt about this meeting in UMass. And I’m so happy to see it. And working with people from Jewish Voice for Peace and other Jewish organizations, as well, has developed dramatically over the years, as the demographic within the Jewish community in United States has changed, and they’re coming more and more 'round to saying, “Not in my name,” and which is hugely encouraging, yeah. I feel overcome, almost, with joy even to be able to speak about it in these terms now. And I'm really looking forward to Saturday in Massachusetts and having—you know, speaking to young people and meeting also the other panelists, all of whom I admire.
AMY GOODMAN : Why risk this criticism? I mean, you are a world-renowned musician, and yet you take this on everywhere you go. Why?
ROGER WATERS : My mom. You know, my mother, when I was young, at one point, she said to me, “You know, at some point in your life, you’re going to be faced with difficult decisions. You should think about things, find out as much as you can about anything that you’re confronted with, then make up your own mind what it is that you’re going to do. There’s nearly always the right thing to do. Just do it.” This is the right thing to do, and I’m just doing it. So, there’s never any sort of question about any of it.
AMY GOODMAN : And what message do you have to other musicians and artists?
ROGER WATERS : Get on board. I mean, a lot of people, a lot of my colleagues in my industry are still very frightened of the industry and of the power in the industry of the Israeli lobby. Just the same as members of Congress are still terrified of AIPAC and the people who fund their elections. That is still there, but it’s diminishing, which is—
AMY GOODMAN : It’s been quite remarkable to see the number of Democratic presidential candidates who did not address AIPAC this year.
ROGER WATERS : It was a huge change, yeah, and hugely encouraging to us all.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you all for being with us, Roger Waters, co-founder of Pink Floyd; Sut Jhally, University of Massachusetts Amherst professor, founder of the Media Education Foundation; and Rachel Weber, attorney and member of Jewish Voice for Peace of Western Massachusetts. This is Democracy Now! We’ll be back in 30 seconds.

AMY GOODMAN : We begin today’s show in Western Massachusetts, where a judge ruled Thursday a panel on Palestinian rights can move forward. “Not Backing Down: Israel, Free Speech, and the Battle for Palestinian Human Rights.” That’s the title of the event set to take place Saturday at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Three anonymous UMass students filed a lawsuit to stop the event, claiming they will, quote, “suffer irreparable harm” if it takes place. But Judge Robert Ullmann ruled Thursday the event can proceed, saying, quote, “There’s nothing that comes even close to a threat of harm or incitement to violence or lawlessness,” he said. Meanwhile, the university has backed the event despite the protests, saying it’s committed to the principles of free speech and academic freedom.
The event is co-sponsored by Jewish Voice for Peace. Group member and attorney Rachel—a group member and attorney responded to Thursday’s decision, saying, quote, “The judge ruled that to shut down this event would be to violate the First Amendment. But we also challenged the false premise that criticism of Israel is somehow inherently antisemitic. We have every right to criticize Israel’s violations of Palestinian human rights. As members of JVP , and as Jews, we stand in solidarity with the event and with the panelists,” Rachel Weber said.
Saturday’s event will include several high-profile speakers, including Palestinian-American activist Linda Sarsour, who has faced death threats for her outspokenness, and Temple University professor Marc Lamont Hill, who was recently fired from CNN for speaking up for Palestinian rights.
It will also include our guest today, who’s joining us in our New York studio: Pink Floyd founder Roger Waters, co-founder of the group Pink Floyd. Also joining us, Rachel Weber, attorney and member of Jewish Voice for Peace of Western Massachusetts. And from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, we’re joined by Sut Jhally, professor of communication at the university and founder and executive director of the Media Education Foundation, which organized the event.
We welcome you all to Democracy Now! Sut Jhally, let’s begin with you. Thanks for joining us from your school, from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Can you explain what has taken place since the announcement of this panel for May 4th?
SUT JHALLY : Yeah. Good morning, Amy. Yeah, it’s been a firestorm of criticism since we announced the panel. I know that the chancellor and the administration have received scores of telephone calls protesting the event. The Massachusetts Republican Party has protested the event and wants it to be canceled. There was a letter written by 80 organizations, 80 right-wing organizations, demanding that the event be canceled and that the university disassociate itself from anything to do with the event. And, of course, as you just mentioned, there was this lawsuit that was filed by this right-wing organization on this spurious notion that somehow talking about Israel-Palestine was going to cause harm to Jewish students.
AMY GOODMAN : What was the organization that you—
SUT JHALLY : And so there’s just been this firestorm of criticism.
AMY GOODMAN : What was the organization you understood brought the suit? I mean, it was brought on behalf of three anonymous University of Massachusetts students.
SUT JHALLY : Yeah, that was just—I think that was just a scam. The lawsuit was brought by a group called Americans for Peace and Prosperity, which is a right-wing, really hate-filled group of reactionaries and bigots. And they started this about four weeks ago, when they first got—they first heard about the panel. They then, I think, found some students at UMass to kind of front the injunction. But this is not—this is not a suit that’s been brought by the students. This is a suit that has been brought by an external organization trying to shut down any kind of critical speech around Israel-Palestine. And I’m very happy that the university and the chancellor has held so firm to the principle of academic freedom and has not at all interfered with our planning for the event.
AMY GOODMAN : Talk more about the university standing up to the protest, saying the panel would move forward. And then, of course, you have the judge hearing this case yesterday, and we’ll talk about that.
SUT JHALLY : Yeah, as I said, I’ve been very—the university has been steadfast in its defense of academic freedom. They try to take what they call a kind of content-neutral approach, saying this is not about this particular issue, but this is about the ability of the university and faculty to sponsor events that talk to the main issues of the day, as controversial as they may be. And the university has not budged from that at all. I have to tell you, I have not even heard from the chancellor, you know, with any kind of concerns whatsoever. And I think that is a great credit to the university.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to turn right now to Rachel Weber, who is joining us from Western Massachusetts. She’s an attorney and member of Jewish Voice for Peace of Western Massachusetts chapter. Can you talk about your involvement in the court case yesterday, Rachel?
RACHEL WEBER : I’m sorry, can you—
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about your involvement in the court case yesterday, what Jewish Voice for Peace, one of the co-sponsors of this event that is set to take place tomorrow—what you said to the court?
RACHEL WEBER : Certainly. So, we intervened as defendants in the case, because we wanted to make sure that the judge and the court was able to hear our concerns contesting the plaintiffs’ use of a definition of anti-Semitism that conflates anti-Semitism with any criticism of Israel. And so, we argued to the court, first of all, that allowing the injunction absolutely would have been a prior restraint on free speech, which is impermissible according to the First Amendment. And the judge was very clear on that. And then we also argued to the judge, both in front of—in open court and also with our filings, that the plaintiffs’ use of a definition of anti-Semitism which includes any criticism of Israel and any advocacy for Palestinians is both incorrect, inflammatory and offensive to Jews, Jewish communities, and also historically inaccurate.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re going to break. And when we come back from our break, we’re going to turn to Roger Waters, the legendary musician, co-founder of Pink Floyd. He is one of the panelists set to speak on Saturday. Stay with us. This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report .

We Can’t Back People Who Hate Our Kids: Kentucky & Minnesota Teachers of Year Boycott Trump Meeting,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/3/we_can_t_back_people_who,"the 2019 Kentucky Teacher of the Year. Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, as we turn to two award-winning teachers who are trying to teach Trump a lesson. On Monday, Jessica Dueñas, the 2019 Kentucky state Teacher of the Year, and Kelly Holstine, the 2018 Minnesota Teacher of the Year, boycotted a White House ceremony honoring them and other state winners of the award to protest the Trump administration’s education policies. But Dueñas and Holstine skipped the event to register their opposition to Trump’s policies on immigration, education and LGBTQ rights, saying many of the White House policies directly impact their immigrant and refugee students.
Well, Democracy Now! ’s Nermeen Shaikh and I sat down with Kelly Holstine, an English high school teacher at Tokata Learning Center in Shakopee, Minnesota, and Jessica Dueñas, a sixth grade special ed teacher at the W.E.B. DuBois Academy in Louisville, Kentucky. Dueñas is the daughter of a Cuban refugee [father] and a Latina mother who at one point was an undocumented immigrant in the U.S. They joined us from Washington, D.C. I began by asking Kelly Holstine why she decided to boycott the Monday White House ceremony.
KELLY HOLSTINE : I spent a lot of time thinking about this decision. I acknowledged that it’s an honor, that it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be in the White House. And I represent—I mean, I respect that location and the position. And I really respect the folks in our cohort who chose to be a part of that. And I’m very much a believer in freedom of speech, and I support that everyone shows that and demonstrates that right in different ways. And we also want to celebrate the National Teacher of the Year, Rodney Robinson. And we celebrate and champion and support him.
But we needed to make our own choice about what felt right for us. And for me, I work at a school that is extremely diverse. It’s an alternative high school in Shakopee. And the policies and the words and the actions of this administration show a great deal of discrimination and prejudice and hatred toward the students that I serve. And I could not, in good conscience, even implicitly support people who hate my kids.
Also, as a gender-nonconforming lesbian, there have been—if you look on the GLAAD website, I think, to date, there’s 104 attacks against my community, against my LGBTQ community. And I want to model for my students that even though you can respect someone’s position, you also can have healthy boundaries and decide what’s right for you. I don’t generally go into other people’s homes if I know that they hate me for who I am without ever actually knowing anything about me.
And so, I really want to model for students that they can make those choices for themselves about what feels healthy for them. But at the end of the day, I just—I can’t actively or implicitly support an administration who treats my kids very, very poorly.
AMY GOODMAN : In what way do they do that, Kelly? That’s strong language: You can’t support or didn’t want to meet with people who hate your children. You were going to be meeting with, what, Betsy DeVos, Pence and President Trump.
KELLY HOLSTINE : Correct.
AMY GOODMAN : How do they hate your children?
KELLY HOLSTINE : Well, if you look at the words and the actions and the policies, the attacks against LGBTQ people, the attacks against immigrants and refugees and people of the global majority and American Indians and people with disabilities, there are so many statements that are made that are negative. And it also creates an environment and a culture in our country that emboldens people who have that hatred and that fear of others, and it causes those folks to be more verbal with their language.
For example, I have a student who is Muslim, and she’s Somali, and she wears a hijab. And every time she’s in public, people yell at her and call her a terrorist and tell her to go back home. And she is the kindest human I’ve ever met. She gives the best hugs of anyone in the world. She is sweet and sassy and smart, and she is articulate. And she could so easily hate the world because of the way that she’s being treated, and she chooses not to hate the world. She chooses to come from a place of light and love. And I just—I can’t support someone who hates someone like that.
And in my classroom, I really support healthy communication and discussion and differences of opinion. But there has to be ground rules for it to be healthy and productive. So, in my classroom, we respect each other’s opinions, but there’s no space for prejudice or discrimination. And you can’t attack other people.
So, if I were to actually have an open opportunity to talk to members of this administration, to Mr. Trump or Mr. Pence or Ms. DeVos, then I would welcome that, if they would follow the ground rules. And experience has taught us that there’s a lot of attacking statements, there’s a lot of prejudice, there’s a lot of discrimination. I wouldn’t expect my students to participate in a conversation like that, because it’s not healthy, and it’s not productive.
AMY GOODMAN : Jessica Dueñas, can you talk about—
JESSICA DUEÑAS: Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : —the decision you made, once you got this really incredible honor to be the 2019 Teacher of the Year of Kentucky, then coming to Washington and deciding not to meet with President Trump and Vice President Pence and the Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos?
JESSICA DUEÑAS: Absolutely. So, when I first learned that I won the award, I was informed that I would have the honor of meeting the president and, you know, members of the administration. Like I said, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that I chose to miss out on. And there are several reasons why.
First, Kentucky is my adopted home. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, and I came to Kentucky seven years ago because I married someone from Louisville. And when we divorced two years ago, I could have gone back home, but I felt very rooted in—at that time I was teaching in Oldham County Schools, which is a semirural county outside of Louisville. And I loved my students, and I loved the friendships that I had made and the connections that I made. So, at that point I felt like a Kentuckian. Kentucky is home, even though I don’t have the accent, clearly. But, you know, after seven years, that’s my home.
And as a representative and having the honor to represent this state, one of the biggest issues that Kentucky is facing right now in terms of education is adequately funding our public schools. As you know, Kentucky is a state that struggles a lot financially. We experience a lot of rural poverty, especially if you look at Appalachia and eastern Kentucky, the rural areas, even our urban areas. I live in an urban area. There is vast poverty throughout the state. And it looks very different depending on the area. And so, throughout this state, we have students who lack resources and have incredible barriers to their learning, because their teachers might not have technology or basic materials to enable these students to learn.
And so, if we allow the privatization agenda that the Trump administration is pushing and also the state administration right now in Kentucky is pushing to happen, the funding that is already barely there for our public schools is going to diminish and get even worse. And so, let’s say we suddenly let in these scholarship tax credits. Now these families are able to pull public school funds, that could have helped many children, and take them out into schools that are not really being regulated. For example, if charter schools were to come into Kentucky, because Kentucky right now doesn’t have any charters, you put these charter schools in, suddenly you’re putting teachers that don’t have to be highly qualified educators to teach our children. So, you might have—and, you know, for example, I’m a teacher of students with disabilities. Charter schools don’t necessarily have to take students like the ones that I teach, which are very high-need students. So, for me, I’m very passionate about that.
And the fact that just a few weeks ago Ms. DeVos came to Kentucky to have a conversation about education, a roundtable discussion, and she met with the governor and the commissioner, but there wasn’t a single public school representative there. And students showed up, public school students showed up, who wanted to see what was happening and, I guess, go back to their schools and report it. They were turned away. What a slap in the face to the state of Kentucky from our federal administration! So, how could I, in good faith, representing the state as a state Teacher of the Year, come to Washington, smile and nod and, you know, kind of put on a show for the administration, when the administration couldn’t even respect the state when they sent a representative there.
The second piece to why I did not want to face the administration was, I’m a first-generation American, as you mentioned in my bio. My father, a Cuban refugee, had to cut sugarcane in Cuba for two years without pay, just to be released by the administration back then, so that he could come to this country in search of a better life. My mother entered legally, which is why she was ultimately able to get her citizenship. She entered legally and overstayed her visa to work. And because of the sacrifices that my parents made, I am now a special education teacher of 11 years.
And let’s go back to the civil rights movement. What would it look like to my students if I, their Latina teacher, gets called an animal by the president, and then I have to go shake his hand? What am I—what message am I sending my African-American male students? That when people in power dehumanize you, you smile and nod? Or do I teach them and remind them, “Hey, back in the ’60s, what did Martin Luther King do? He spoke up. What did John Lewis do? He spoke up. What did Rosa Parks do? She spoke up. What did the Freedom Riders do? They spoke up”? And, hey, they went through great consequences.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, I’d like to turn to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. In March, she refused to state whether schools should be allowed to discriminate against students based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This is DeVos being questioned by Wisconsin Democrat Mark Pocan during testimony before a House Education Appropriations Subcommittee.
REP . MARK POCAN : Do you think it’s all right for a school to discriminate based on someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity?
EDUCATION SECRETARY BETSY DEVOS : We have laws that cover discriminatory efforts, and our Office for Civil Rights has continued to be very diligent in investigating any allegation of discrimination and will continue to do so.
REP . MARK POCAN : So, is that a yes, or is that a no? I’m trying to get a yes or no, I guess, on that.
EDUCATION SECRETARY BETSY DEVOS : We follow the law as this body has—
REP . MARK POCAN : So, personally, you don’t have an opinion on it?
EDUCATION SECRETARY BETSY DEVOS : —has defined. And—
REP . MARK POCAN : OK. Because you are giving money—it leads me to the next question. You are giving money to some charter schools that do discriminate.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : So, that was Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Meanwhile, second lady of the United States Karen Pence is working at a Virginia private school that explicitly bans LGBTQ workers and students. Pence is teaching at the Immanuel Christian School in Washington, D.C.'s suburbs, where an employment application requires job candidates to pledge not to engage in homosexual activity or to violate the, quote, “unique roles of male and female.” The application also advises women that, quote, “A wife is commanded to submit to her husband as the church submits to Christ,” unquote. So, Kelly Holstine, could you respond to what DeVos said and also Vice President Pence's wife?
KELLY HOLSTINE : It hurts my heart, because what if a student, while in Mrs. Pence’s care, begins to figure out who they are in this world, and what if they figure out that they’re gay or lesbian or bi or trans, and they look to their teachers for that support and that love and that safety to be who they are? The suicide rate is five times higher for our LGBTQ community than it is for our heterosexual community in youth. And so these youth are going to feel isolated and lonely and unsupported. And that, it really hurts my heart for those youth to be in an environment that is so openly full of hate and discrimination toward something that they have no choice about.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Kelly Holstine, the 2019 Minnesota Teacher of the Year, and Jessica Dueñas, the 2019 Kentucky state Teacher of the Year. They boycotted the White House ceremony honoring all 50 state winners of the award in protest of the Trump administration.

In Seattle, Washington, dozens of people rallied this week at the immigration court where prominent activist Maru Mora-Villalpando was ordered to appear. It was her third hearing since ICE moved to deport her last year, after she organized a series of “resistance workshops” across the state. The judge set another hearing date for November, and Mora-Villalpando vowed to return with more protesters.
Maru Mora-Villalpando : “I think that, in a way, coming to this building to show the epicenter of detentions and deportations in Washington, it’s definitely part of our work, and it benefits our work, because most people didn’t know that this place existed in the first place. They have no idea that this private building hosts many offices of ICE , Homeland Security Investigations and Department of Justice. Here is where decisions are made. And we are very happy to bring people here every time we come and for people to understand that this is another place of resistance.”
Mora-Villalpando also has a pending civil rights lawsuit challenging how ICE surveils, detains and deports outspoken immigrant activists. The case cites the arrest of well-known New York activist Ravi Ragbir at his regular ICE check-in. Last week, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of Ragbir in his own free speech case, saying the First Amendment bars ICE from targeting activists for deportation based on their political speech, and writing, “To allow this retaliatory conduct to proceed would broadly chill protected speech, among not only activists subject to final orders of deportation but also those citizens and other residents who would fear retaliation against others.” Topics: Immigrant Rights The Daily News Digest Our Daily Digest brings Democracy Now! to your inbox each morning.

The Pentagon is facing accusations that it is drastically underestimating the number of civilians being killed in U.S. airstrikes overseas. On Thursday, the Pentagon released a report saying the U.S. had killed 120 civilians in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Somalia last year. However, the watchdog monitoring group Airwars says the total is at least 10 times higher. In Iraq and Syria, the Pentagon admitted to killing 42 people, but Airwars put the civilian death toll from attacks by the U.S.-led coalition at over 800.

"“We Shall Overcome”: Remembering Folk Icon, Activist Pete Seeger in His Own Words & Songs | Democracy Now!",www.democracynow.org,,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2015/7/3/we_shall_overcome_remembering_folk_icon,"
My brothers and my sisters, All over this land.
AMY GOODMAN : The legendary folk singer and activist Pete Seeger died in January 2014 at the age of 94. For nearly seven decades, Pete Seeger was a musical and political icon who helped create the modern American folk music movement. In the 1940s, he performed in The Almanac Singers with Woody Guthrie. Then he formed The Weavers. In the '50s, he opposed Senator Joseph McCarthy's witch hunt and was almost jailed for refusing to answer questions before the HUAC , the House Un-American Activities Committee. Pete Seeger became a prominent civil rights activist and helped popularize the anthem, “We Shall Overcome.” He was also a vocal critic of the Vietnam War and inspired a generation of protest singers. Later in his life, Pete was at the center of the environmental and anti-nuclear movements. With his wife Toshi Seeger, Pete Seeger helped found Clearwater, a group to clean up the Hudson River in New York. Toshi Seeger died [in 2013], just weeks before their 70th wedding anniversary. In 2009, Pete Seeger and Bruce Springsteen performed Woody Guthrie’s “This Land is Your Land” on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at an inaugural concert for Barack Obama, when he first became president.
Pete Seeger last joined us on Democracy Now! in August of 2013 . We’ll play highlights from that interview later, but first I want to turn to Pete Seeger in 2004 , when he joined us in our firehouse studio at Democracy Now! I asked Pete Seeger to talk about his time serving in the military during World War II.
PETE SEEGER : I first wanted to be a mechanic in the Air Force. I thought that would be an interesting thing. But then military intelligence got interested in my politics. My outfit went on to glory and death, and I stayed there in Keesler Field, Mississippi, picking up cigarette butts for six months. Finally, they let me know, yes, they’d been investigating me, opening all my mail.
AMY GOODMAN : Pete Seeger, when you came back, they continued to investigate you.
PETE SEEGER : Well, I have assumed most of my life that if there wasn’t a microphone under the bed, they were tapping the phone from time to time and opening my mail from time to time. Who knows?
AMY GOODMAN : But it was more than that, wasn’t it?
PETE SEEGER : Well, sometimes they’d have picket lines out, but, you know, in a crazy way all it did was sell tickets. I remember one concert did not sell out. My manager said, “Pete, we should have gotten the Birches to picket you. Then it would have sold out.”
AMY GOODMAN : I’m looking at a transcript of the House Un-American Activities Committee, August 18th, 1955, when they started off by saying—Mr. Taverner said, “When and where were you born, Mr. Seeger?” You actually answered that question.
PETE SEEGER : Well, I wish I had been more—spoken up more. I just did what my lawyer, a very nice guy—he says, “Don’t try to antagonize them. Just don’t answer these questions, because if you answer this kind of question, you’re going to have to answer more questions. Just say you don’t think it’s legal.” Well, I said, “I think I’ve got a right to my opinion, and you have the right to your opinion. Period.”
And so, eventually I was sentenced to a year in jail, but my lawyer got me off on bail. I was only in jail for four hours, and I learned a folk song. They served us lunch, a slice of bread and a slice of bologna and an apple, and the man next to me was singing, ” If that judge believes what I say, I’ll be leaving for home today .” The man next to him says, “Not if he sees your record, you won’t.” But that’s an old African melody, you know. It’s in many, many African-American folk songs.
AMY GOODMAN : Now, you were sentenced to a year in jail?
PETE SEEGER : And a year later the appeals court acquitted me. Ironically—the contradictions of life still amaze me—the judge who acquitted me, the head judge—there were three judges—head one was Irving Kaufman, the man who sentenced the Rosenbergs to the chair 10 years earlier. But he acquitted me. He said, “We are not inclined to lightly disregard charges of unconstitutionality, even though they may be made by those unworthy of our respect.”
However, I feel that—both my wife and I feel we’re lucky to be alive and lucky to be on good terms with our neighbors, and in the little town where we live, people shout out, “Hi, Pete! Hi, Toshi!” And I’d like to—I wish I could live another 20 years just to see things that are happening, because I believe that women working with children will get men to wake up to what a foolish thing it is to seek power and glory and money in your life. What a foolish thing. Here we are—
There’s a politician in my hometown, a very nice guy. He used to be a shop steward for the union in the local factory, but for 20 years he represented our town in the county legislature. And he said, “Pete, if you don’t grow, you die.” One o’clock in the morning, I sat up in bed and thought of the next question. If that’s true, if you don’t grow, you die, doesn’t it follow the quicker you grow, the sooner you die? Nobody is facing up to that question, but it’s very definitely true. Now the first step in solving a problem is to admit there’s a problem. Then we can argue about ways it could be solved.
I suppose one person will say, “Well, let a few people have trillions of dollars and the rest of the people obediently do the work, and the people in charge will see that everything is done right.” On other hand, I think what was in the Declaration of Independence is true now just as it was then. Those great lines, they’re written by Ben Franklin, you know, not Jefferson. “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these rights are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that when any government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it.”
AMY GOODMAN : Pete Seeger, can you tell us about “We Shall Overcome”?
PETE SEEGER : I thought, in 1946, when I learned it from a white woman who taught in a union labor school, the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, that the song had been made up in 1946 by tobacco workers, because they sang it there to strike through the winter of 1946 in Charleston, South Carolina, and they taught the song to Zilphia Horton, the teacher at the labor school. And she said, “Oh, it was my favorite song.” And I printed it in our little magazine in New York, People’s Songs , as “We Will Overcome” in 1947.
It was a friend of mine, Guy Carawan, who made it famous. He picked up my way of singing it, “We Shall Overcome,” although Septima—there was another teacher there, Septima Clark, a black woman. She felt that “shall”—like me, she felt it opened up the mouth better than “will,” so that’s the way she sang it. Anyway, Guy Carawan in 1960 taught it to the young people at the founding convention of SNCC , Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, SNCC for short. And a month later, it wasn’t a song, it was the song, throughout the South.
Only two years ago, I get a letter from a professor in Pennsylvania, who uncovered an issue of the United Mine Workers Journal of February 1909, and a letter there on front page says, “Last year at our strike, we opened every meeting with a prayer, and singing that good old song, 'We Will Overcome.'” So it’s probably a late 19th century union version of what was a well-known gospel song. I’ll overcome, I’ll overcome, I’ll overcome some day .
AMY GOODMAN : You sang it for Martin Luther King?
PETE SEEGER : In 1957, I went down to Highlander. Zilphia was dead, and Myles Horton, her husband, said, “We can’t have a celebration of 25 years with this school without music. Won’t you come down and help lead some songs?” So I went down, and Dr. King and Reverend Abernathy came up from Alabama to say a few words, and I sang a few songs, and that was one of them. Anne Braden drove King to a speaking engagement in Kentucky the next day, and she remembers him sitting in the back seat, saying, “'We Shall Overcome.' That song really sticks with you, doesn’t it?” But he wasn’t the song leader. It wasn’t until another three years that Guy Carawan made it famous.
AMY GOODMAN : In 1967, you made your stand against the Vietnam War clear on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour . Can you talk about that?
PETE SEEGER : Well, the Smothers Brothers were a big, big success on CBS television. And way back the year before, I think in the spring of '67, they said—CBS says, “Anything we can do for you? You're right at the top. What can we do to make you happier?” And they said, “Let us have Seeger on.” And CBS said, “Well, we’ll think about it.” Finally, in October, they said, “OK, you can have him on.” And I sang this song ” Waste deep in the big muddy, the big fool says to push on .”
The tape was made in California, flown to New York. And in New York they scissored the song out. And now, the Smothers Brothers took to the print media and said, ” CBS is censoring our best jokes. They censored Seeger’s best song.” And they got some publicity. And during November, December and January, the arguments went on. Finally, in February—no, pardon me, late January, late January of '68, CBS said, “OK, OK, he can sing the song.” On six hours' notice, I flew out to California.
I remember singing a batch of songs from American history, songs from the Revolution, like ” Come ye hither, redcoats, you mind what madness fills. In our forest there is danger, there’s danger in our hills. Fall the rifles, the rifles in our hands shall prove no trifle. ” I think I mentioned the hit song of 1814. It was the hit song: ” Oh, say can you see. ” And the song of the Mexican War, ” Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew. ” A love song. That’s why Yankees are called “gringos” in Mexico, from that song. And, of course, the Civil War, several good songs, not just “Battle Hymn of the Republic,” but a batch of them. The Spanish-American War, Oscar Brown taught me this song. American soldiers in the Philippines, they were singing, ” Damn, damn, damn the Filipinos. Cross-eyed kakiack ladrones. And beneath the starry flag, civilize them with a crag, and go back to our own beloved home. ” I didn’t sing that. But along come modern times. I sang “Waste Deep in the Big Muddy,” and this time only a station in Detroit cut it out. But the rest of the country heard it, so seven million people heard it.
Who knows? Later that month, in late February, Lyndon Johnson decided not to run for re-election. The song would be probably just one more thing. I honestly believe that the future is going to be millions of little things saving us. I imagine a big seesaw, and at one end of this seesaw is on the ground with a basket half-full of big rocks in it. The other end of the seesaw is up in the air. It’s got a basket one-quarter full of sand. And some of us got teaspoons, and we’re trying to fill up sand. A lot of people are laughing at us, and they say, “Ah, people like you have been trying to do that for thousands of years, and it’s leaking out as fast as you’re putting it in.” But we’re saying, “We’re getting more people with teaspoons all the time.” And we think, “One of these years, you’ll see that whole seesaw go zooop in the other direction.” And people will say, “Gee, how did it happen so suddenly?” Us and all our little teaspoons. Now granted, we’ve got to keep putting it in, because if we don’t keep putting teaspoons in, it will leak out, and the rocks will go back down again. Who knows?
AMY GOODMAN : Do you see those cracks, those places, today in mass media? I know you don’t watch TV and all that, but, for example, you going on Smothers Brothers. Do you think that it is as constricted today?
PETE SEEGER : Not as constricted, no. There’s all sorts of little things going on. I understand this program may be on some TV stations. I’ve got to find out where, when, so I can see it. You’re right, I don’t look at TV much, except to check on the weather for my skating rink. I’m a read-aholic and a magazine-aholic, I get 40 or 50 magazines a month. And I read music magazines, environmental magazines, union magazines, civil rights magazines. Who knows?
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Pete Seeger in our firehouse studio 10 years ago in 2004. We continue remembering Pete in his own words and song.
[break]
AMY GOODMAN : Pete Seeger, singing “Waist Deep in the Big Muddy” on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in 1968. This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, as we continue to remember the life of Pete Seeger, the legendary folk singer and activist. We return to our interview back in 2004, a decade ago, in our firehouse studio. I asked Pete Seeger to talk about one of his most famous songs, “Where Have All the Flowers Gone?”
PETE SEEGER : Well, I was sitting in an airplane on my way to sing at Oberlin College. I was over Ohio, and—
AMY GOODMAN : What year?
PETE SEEGER : —half-dozing. Year, 1955. And all of a sudden, three lines, which I had read in a book, took form. In the book, it simply said, “Where are the flowers? The girls have plucked them. Where are the girls? They’re all married. Where are the men? They’re all in the army.” It’s an old Russian folk song. And the Don Cossacks—maybe it’s a Ukrainian folk song. “Koloda Duda” is the original name, but I didn’t know that. All I knew is I had read these three lines in the book And Quiet Flows the Don by a Soviet novelist. And all of a sudden, I had three verses. I didn’t realize it at the time, I had swiped part of the verse from an old Irish song. I had been recording a lumberjack song from the Adirondacks: ” Johnson says he’ll load more hay, says he’ll load 10 times a day .” You can really see, I slowed it down, and I pinned the words to the microphone that night and sang them.
And a few weeks later, I was walking down 48th Street, Manhattan, stopped in at Folkways Records, said, “I made up a new song.” And then, Moe Asch propped a mic up in front of me and recorded it. And a few months later it was out on another LP. An Oberlin College student got the LP at a job at a summer camp, and the kids were fooling around with the verses: ” Where have all the counselors gone, broken curfew everyone. ” But by the end of the summer, he had made up the two extra verses we know. “Where have the soldiers gone, gone to graveyards. Where have the graveyards gone, covered with flowers.”
And the kids took the song back to New York. Peter, Paul and Mary were singing in the Village, in Greenwich Village, and picked it up, started singing it. The Kingston Trio learned it from them. And about three years later, my manager says, “Pete, didn’t you write a song called 'Where Have All the Flowers Gone'?” I said, “Yeah, about three years ago.” He said, “Did you copyright it?”“No, don’t guess I ever did.” He said, “Well, you ought to. The Kingston Trio have recorded it.”
Well, I got on the phone to Dave Guard. He was an old friend. He had started playing the banjo because he got my book, my bestseller. I mimeographed it first, but later printed it. It’s printed 100,000 copies. How to Play the Five-String Banjo . He wrote me a year later. He says, “I’ve been putting that book to hard use. I and two others have a group we call The Kingston Trio.” So I called him up. “Oh, Pete, we didn’t know it was your song. We’ll take our name off it.” It was very nice of him, because technically, legally, I had, as they say, quote, “abandoned copyright.” But they took their name off, and my manager copyrighted it. It pays my taxes these days, that song. It’s been translated into dozens of other languages.
AMY GOODMAN : Pete, could you play “Where Have All the Flowers Gone?”
PETE SEEGER : Where — ah, maybe I’ll just sing the very, very last verse, because the contradictions of life still amaze me. You have to laugh, if you don’t cry.
Where have all the graveyards gone? Long time passing. Where have all the graveyards gone? Long time ago. Where have all the graveyards gone? Covered with flowers every one. When will we ever learn? When will we ever learn?
AMY GOODMAN : You still have your voice.
PETE SEEGER : It’s in the cellar.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about getting older?
PETE SEEGER : Oh, it’s no fun to lose your memory or your hearing or your eyesight, but from my shoulders on down I’m in better condition than most men my age. I can go skiing with the family, although I stick to the intermediate slopes. I don’t try the double diamond.
AMY GOODMAN : Pete, you sit here listening with headphones on. You’re a singer. Sound is very important. It’s not as easy for you to hear things so clearly anymore. How has that affected you?
PETE SEEGER : Well, I’m singing to myself all the time, just humming or just in my brain. I’m not making any sound. But admittedly, I can’t—unless I have earphones on, I can’t really—even with what they call hearing aids, I can’t really hear music. I don’t listen to CDs. I don’t listen to the radio. I don’t listen to TV. And occasionally, when friends come around, I’ll join in with them, but my fingers are slowing down. I hear records that I made years ago and say, “How did I ever play that so fast?”
On the other hand, these are exciting times. There’s never been such as exciting times. And win, lose or draw, it’s going to be very, very exciting. And I applaud what you are doing. I think what Democracy Now! is doing is just fantastic. This couldn’t have been done half a century ago, could not have been done.
AMY GOODMAN : Why?
PETE SEEGER : Well, they didn’t have the technology for it, I guess. So as I say, technology will save us if it doesn’t wipe us out first.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, final words, Pete Seeger, as we wrap up this conversation—the role of music, culture and politics.
PETE SEEGER : They’re all tangled up. Hooray for tangling!
AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you very much for being with us. And for someone who isn’t so hopeful who is listening to this right now, trying to find their way, what would you say?
PETE SEEGER : Realize that little things lead to bigger things. That’s what Seeds is all about. And there’s a wonderful parable in the New Testament: The sower scatters seeds. Some seeds fall in the pathway and get stamped on, and they don’t grow. Some fall on the rocks, and they don’t grow. But some seeds fall on fallow ground, and they grow and multiply a thousandfold. Who knows where some good little thing that you’ve done may bring results years later that you never dreamed of?
AMY GOODMAN : Pete Seeger speaking a decade ago in 2004 on Democracy Now! He last appeared on Democracy Now! in August 2013. He talked about one of his most famous songs.
PETE SEEGER : The song, “If I Had a Hammer,” went all sorts of places that I could never go, and I’m very glad.
[singing] If I had a hammer, I’d hammer in the morning, I’d hammer in the evening, All over this land, I’d hammer out danger, Hammer out a warning, Hammer out love between, All of my brothers,
Oh, a woman said, “Make that 'My brothers and my sisters.'” Lee says, “It doesn’t roll off the tongue so well. But she insisted. He said, “How about 'All of my siblings'?” She didn’t think that was funny.
[singing] All over this land. If I had a song,
Don’t need to sing the whole song. You can sing it to yourself, whether you’re driving a car or washing the dishes or just singing to your kids. We haven’t mentioned children much on this program, but it may be children realizing that you can’t live without love, you can’t live without fun and laughter, you can’t live without friends—and I say, “Long live teachers of children,” because they can show children how they can save the world.
AMY GOODMAN : And we end with more Pete Seeger last August [in 2013].
PETE SEEGER : We shall overcome. We shall overcome. We shall overcome some day. Oh, deep in my heart, I know that I do believe, We shall overcome…

In environmental news, the state of Maine has become the first state to ban food containers made of Styrofoam. Democratic Governor Janet Mills said, “Polystyrene cannot be recycled like a lot of other products, so while that cup of coffee may be finished, the Styrofoam cup it was in is not. In fact, it will be around for decades to come and eventually it will break down into particles, polluting our environment, hurting our wildlife, and even detrimentally impacting our economy.” The words of Maine’s Democratic Governor Janet Mills.

Joe Biden’s Son Hunter Is Invested in China’s Mass Surveillance Program Used to Monitor Uyghurs | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/7/joe_bidens_son_hunter_is_invested,"Joe Biden’s Son Hunter Is Invested in China’s Mass Surveillance Program Used to Monitor Uyghur Muslims Story May 07, 2019 investigative journalist for The Intercept.

As the United Nations accuses the Chinese government of setting up massive camps in the far-west Xinjiang province to imprison an unknown number of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims, Human Rights Watch reports that China is carrying out mass surveillance there using a mobile app that lets authorities monitor the Muslim population. We speak with investigative reporter Lee Fang about an unexpected investor in Chinese surveillance: Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son. And we speak with Human Rights Watch China director Sophie Richardson. This is viewer supported news. Please do your part today. Donate Related Story investigative journalist for The Intercept. Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : I just want to let people know, for people who are reading about this, Uyghur is spelled U-Y-G-H-U-R. That’s Uyghur. We are joined also by Lee Fang, investigative journalist with The Intercept , to look at the unexpected investor in Chinese surveillance: Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden. Fang’s most recent article is headlined Chinese Fund Backed By Hunter Biden Invested In Technology Used To Surveil Muslims . Lee, thanks for joining us again on Democracy Now! Explain what you learned.
LEE FANG : Amy, thanks for having me. China’s sprawling police state relies heavily on a high-tech security apparatus to monitor, track and incarcerate those viewed as a threat to the Chinese state. That’s dissidents, activists, journalists and increasingly the entire Uyghur Muslim population in Western China. And a key component of this security apparatus is the collection of biometric data. This biometric data collection comes from a number of private sector firms. One of the major Chinese startups involved in this biometric data collection is a company called Face++. This is a facial recognition software company, a Chinese company. It provided a key license to the app that Sophie has explained, and it’s also used in security cameras all over the country. Now, in the last week we have seen a number of Western reports scrutinizing the Chinese investors that stand to profit, that have invested in Face++. But in our story on Friday, we revealed that there are a number of American investors that also stand to profit from this mass surveillance that are also invested in Face++, one of whom is Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And Lee, how exactly did — and when — did Hunter Biden form his Chinese investment company, Bohai Harvest RST ? How did that come about?
LEE FANG : Well, over the last 10 years, Hunter Biden has been involved in a number of investment opportunities and business deals. In 2008, he de-registered as a lobbyist and transitioned into this investment career. In 2014, he traveled to China and formed this very exclusive investor partnership with the Chinese government, partnering with the Bank of China. That’s one of the largest state owned banks. And in 2017, Hunter Biden and his company, Bohai Harvest RST , participated in the C Series investment round in Face++, helping the company raise over $400 million, bringing its valuation to currently over $3 billion. So he’s far from a passive investor. In fact, this business deal shows that he has been given really exclusive access to investing in some Chinese—China’s most largest technology companies. And he certainly stands to benefit as this company continues to grow.
AMY GOODMAN : There are Democrats who have pointed out that this issue of Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, the presidential candidate’s son, is being pushed by, oh, The Daily Caller and Fox to discredit Biden. Your response, Lee Fang?
LEE FANG : Look, the tactic by special interests, both domestic and foreign, to put politicians on the payroll of any interest group seeking to seek influence over a powerful politician is a bipartisan issue. It is not a right-wing issue or a left-wing issue. I can go through a laundry list of Democrats and Republicans in Congress who have had family members, sons and daughters or spouses, that were added to lobbying firms or corporations to peddle influence.
And this dynamic extends certainly to the White House as well. The Trump sons, including Don Jr., have received exclusive licensing agreements and permits to expand Trump hotels in Indonesia and in India and so on. Ivanka has received special licenses to sell her products in China. We see this dynamic and this criticism, in addition to the Biden family, coming from folks from across the ideological spectrum, and it is not particular to the China issue.
In 2003, one of the most controversial votes Joe Biden took—he joined with Republicans to pass the 2003 bankruptcy bill. At the time, one of the largest credit card issuers in the country was MBNA , which was lobbying for that legislation. MBNA hired Hunter Biden as a consultant at a time when they were lobbying for Joe Biden to pass that law. In 2014, when Joe Biden was engaged in high-stakes negotiations in Ukraine at a time at the height of Russian aggression in that region, Hunter Biden was hired and placed on the board of a major Ukrainian fracking company, paid as much as $50,000 a month.
And now with this China issue, we’re seeing a lot of criticism of Joe Biden and his son, because again, Hunter Biden gained exclusive access to this very unusual investment vehicle, investment deal, with the Chinese state at a time when Joe Biden was leading negotiations, traveling between Beijing and Washington, D.C., as the vice president. And it will pose serious conflicts of interest as Joe Biden seeks the presidential nomination.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: That’s one thing I wanted to ask you about. Because clearly, this would, to some critics of the corporate wing of the Democratic party, this will definitely give them cause to raise that this is a repetition of the Clinton family’s corruption issues over their dealings with foreign governments as well.
LEE FANG : Well, that certainly may be a political issue, but it is also a genuine policy concern for any observer or any critic of U.S.-China relations. And look, it is not exclusive to the Biden family. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, was once a big critic of China policy, of China human rights. Later he became a big proponent of trade relations with China and kind of ended his very vocal criticism of China. Later, actually after the 2016 election, Mitch McConnell’s sister-in-law, Angela Chow, was added to the board of Bank of China. There are many instances, both Republican and Democrat, where China has attempted to seek influence with powerful policy figures.
Joe Biden, I should note, has long been a friend of China. In 2000, when there was a major vote about permanent normal trade relations with China, Joe Biden rallied Democratic support and he basically argued that China does not pose an economic threat to the U.S. That China, at the time—this was in the year 2000—had the economy of the size of the Netherlands, and that China would never pose a threat to American manufacturing. So Joe Biden has been a friend of China for a very long time, and it appears China has been very friendly to the Joe Biden family as well.
AMY GOODMAN : Sophie Richardson, I wanted to ask you about this Foreign Policy article that was out in March headlined U.S. Firms Are Helping Build China’s Orwellian State . Can you talk about this and how this relates to the mass surveillance, particularly of the Muslim community in China?
SOPHIE RICHARDSON : Sure. Just picking up on one of Lee’s points, I think American companies and funds and portfolios of investments that are engaged with Chinese surveillance companies need to stop right now and have a long, close look at what exactly they are invested in, and where they actually want to be putting money. But we looked at one particular company, a Massachusetts-based medical technology firm called Thermo Fisher Scientific, which we found to be selling DNA sequencers to the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau. For which they had the right export licensesÑlet’s be clear about that. But they were doing so at a time when we were documenting the Xinjiang authorities imposing compulsory collection of DNA samples from everyone across the region between the ages of 12 and 65, under the guise of a free public healthcare program.
And we went to this company several times and said, “What’s your due diligence strategy to make sure that your sales and operations aren’t contributing to human rights violations?” And they never really answered that question. Members of Congress asked them. And finally The New York Times wrote about their activities, at which point the company said, “We’ve decided to stop selling this particular technology in that particular region.” But we don’t know what they continue to sell to other parts of the country. And the reality is we still aren’t any clearer about what strategies they have in place to answer that due diligence question. And I think that applies equally to any company—American, European, Australian, anyone’s companies—that are doing business in a region that has been labeled by U.N. experts as a rights-free zone.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I wanted to ask you about a separate China-related issue. Last week, tens of thousands of people in Hong Kong marched peacefully against a proposal that would allow people in Hong Kong to be extradited to China for trial, where they would obviously face fewer protections than in Hong Kong, which has long operated under the “one country, two systems” mantra. Could you talk about that and your concerns about that?
SOPHIE RICHARDSON : Sure. I think if this agreement goes ahead, we have gone really from “one country, two systems” to “one country, one system” because it would effectively gut some of the protections that have long been available to people in Hong Kong, but not in the rest of Mainland China, if they are to be extradited. There are all sorts of ramifications for knowing the evidence against you and having access to counsel. And it has been seen widely in Hong Kong in the last couple of weeks as a serious encroachment, particularly in Hong Kong’s judicial independence and integrity. And that is an institution in Hong Kong that has always stood the territory apart from the rest of the mainland, and if it loses that kind of authority and integrity, it really is seen as Hong Kong just becoming another part of the mainland.
AMY GOODMAN : And finally, on this trade negotiation that is taking place this week, Sophie, President Trump announcing plans to increase tariffs $200 billion, from 10% to 25%. Also threatening to impose new tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese products.
Your thoughts about this move, regarding trade with China? And just as the Trump administration says they will not impose any kind of sanctions related to what we are talking about.
SOPHIE RICHARDSON : We don’t particularly have a view on things like tariffs. We have a lot of views on the use of sanctions, particularly the Global Magnitsky sanctions, which are meant to be imposed on individuals or entities that are credibly alleged to have been involved in serious human rights violations. So people like the current Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo would clearly be a target for precisely these kinds of sanctions. And especially given Secretary Pompeo’s and other administration officials’ willingness to be publicly very critical of China’s actions in Xinjiang, the fact that the administration is not going ahead with these kinds of sanctions is not just giving China a free pass and enabling it; it is really undercutting the very purpose of those sanctions at all.
And so it is also worth pointing out that this is an administration that doesn’t seem to have trouble sanctioning lots of different people and companies for different kinds of behavior. And so the unwillingness on this particular matter is seriously problematic and really effectively is saying to the Chinese government, “Do what you want in Xinjiang,” and saying to Uyghurs, “We’re not actually really concerned about what’s happening to you or your family members.”
AMY GOODMAN : Sophie Richardson, we want to thank you very much for being with us. China director for Human Rights Watch. We’re going to link to your whole comprehensive report .

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We end today’s show looking at Republican efforts to suppress the vote in Florida. Civil rights groups are decrying what they say is a new poll tax after the Florida Senate passed a bill Friday that would require formerly incarcerated people with felony convictions to repay all fines and fees to courts before their voting rights are restored. This comes six month after voters in Florida approved a measure to restore voting rights to 1.4 million people with nonviolent felonies who have fully completed their sentences, overturning a Jim Crow-era law aimed at keeping African Americans from voting. One in five African Americans in Florida and 10% of the state’s adult population have been ineligible to vote because of a criminal record.
AMY GOODMAN : Nearly 65% of voters approved the constitutional amendment to reenfranchise people with former felony convictions in November. It was hailed as the biggest win for voting rights around the country in decades with the potential to sway the 2020 election and beyond. But the Florida legislature’s vote threatens to keep tens of thousands from the ballot boxes. Florida Democrats are urging Republican governor Ron DeSantis to veto the legislation, saying in a statement “If the voter suppression measures go into effect, DeSantis will be known as the Jim Crow Governor.”
We go now to Desmond Meade, President of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, chair of the Floridians for a Fair Democracy. He spearheaded Amendment 4, which has reenfranchised 1.4 million Floridians, including himself. Or so he hoped. Desmond Meade, welcome back to Democracy Now! What is going on here? The amendment passed overwhelmingly. Explain what the governor and the legislature—governor hasn’t signed this yet, but—are pushing.
DESMOND MEADE : Yes. First of all, good morning, Amy, and thank you for having me back again on your show. I will start off by saying that what we were able to accomplish in November of 2018 still remains intact. At the heart of Amendment 4 was the fact that we abolished a 150-year-old Jim Crow law in Florida. Prior to Amendment 4 passing, anyone convicted of a felony offense faced a lifetime bar from voting. And so we effectively removed that. And no matter what the legislature comes up with, that victory still remains intact.
AMY GOODMAN : But what about this—what people are calling a poll tax? How are they going to limit the 1.4 million people who potentially could become voters again?
DESMOND MEADE : When you talk about the impact that the restoration of voting rights would have even on future elections, when we look at the impact of this legislation, it only—we’re estimating that it impacts about 700,000 returning citizens. That leaves another 700,000 who would not be impacted at all by this legislation. And as an organization that speaks for or on behalf of returning citizens, what we’re focused on mostly is how can we engage those 700,000 people and get them registered to vote and get them voting? Because at the end of the day, you’re talking about a state in which it took only took 30,000 votes to decide the governor, 15,000 to decide the congressman and about 100,000 to decide the president of United States.
Now, as a relates to the legislation that is before the governor now to sign, there are still some gems in that legislation that would allow the 700,000 that are impacted to have a much easier pathway to voting. In that legislation, they give the judge—a judge has the authority to waive those financial obligations or convert them to community service hours. And so that is some bright spots that’s in that legislation coming out. And that is what we are moving forward on.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Desmond, in terms of the impact of the original referendum vote, Florida has 21 million people. It’s the third-largest state in the union, clearly the largest battleground state. And the impact on the presidential election of 2020 that could be had by those 700,000 at least getting registered—what has been the progress so far in getting people registered?
DESMOND MEADE : So one of the things—first of all, our organization has already registered over 5,000 returning citizens. And then there are multiple organizations that are out there registering folks. And we have returning citizens that are registering on their own. And so there are literally thousands of returning citizens that have already been added to the roster, myself included. I registered to vote in January. I received my voter registration card and looking forward to participating. I think what is crucial, what is important for us as returning citizens, is that we are looking to impact every election along the lines of the issues that impact people with felony convictions and their family members. We’re looking to impact elections based around criminal justice reform.
AMY GOODMAN : Why do you choose to use that term “returning citizens”?
DESMOND MEADE : When we first started, what we found was that when you refer to someone as an ex-con or ex-felon, you actually increase the likely of them recidivating. We’ve heard that if you call a child stupid growing up, eventually that child will believe that. And so we are a group that is committed to increasing public safety. We are a group that is committed to becoming assets in our community. And so we use the term “returning citizens” to put a more positive energy out there, to encourage folks who have made mistakes in the past that they are not less than human, that they are a citizen, that they are a human being that can be contributing members of society.
AMY GOODMAN : Andrew Gillum, who narrowly lost the Florida gubernatorial election to DeSantis in November, tweeted “Amendment 4 got a million more votes than me and a million more votes than Governor Ron DeSantis. The governor would be well advised to veto this poll tax. Voters spoke loud and clear — we believe in second chances.” We have 10 seconds, Desmond Meade. Do you think DeSantis is signing off on this?
DESMOND MEADE : Chances are he is going to sign off on it. We know that during his campaign, he called for implementation legislation. We believe that there should not be implementation legislation. Is this the legislation that we would like? No, we don’t like it. But we know that there are some gems in it, and we’re going to do our best to create a more inclusive and vibrant democracy in the state of Florida, and we will have an impact in 2020 and beyond.
AMY GOODMAN : Desmond Meade, we want to thank you for being with us. President of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, chair of the Floridians for a Fair Democracy. I’m Amy Goodman with Juan González. Thanks for joining us. The Up Next"

Cecile Richards: Georgia’s New “Fetal Heartbeat” Bill Criminalizes Women Who Seek Abortions | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/8/cecile_richards_georgia_s_new_fetal,"co-founder of Supermajority and former president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : Let’s talk about what has just happened in Georgia. The Republican governor who beat Stacey Abrams, Brian Kemp, who was secretary of state—and she has sued over his both remaining secretary of state in charge of the elections and running for governor. But the Republican governor, Brian Kemp has signed into law a six-week abortion ban, or so-called “fetal heartbeat law.” It bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, something that typically happens just six weeks into a pregnancy and before many women realize they’re pregnant. This is Kemp speaking at the signing of the bill on Tuesday.
GOV . BRIAN KEMP : The LIFE Act is very simple, but also very powerful. A declaration that all life has value, that all life matters, and that all life is worthy of protection. I understand, like the others have said, that some oppose this legislation. I realize that some may challenge it in the court of law. But our job is to do what is right, not what is easy. We are called to be strong and courageous, and we will not back down. We will always continue to fight for life.
AMY GOODMAN : So that’s Georgia’s Republican Governor Brian Kemp, the latest in a series of attacks on reproductive rights across the U.S. Last month, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also signed into law a six-week abortion ban. Legislation doesn’t include exceptions for cases of rape or incest. More than two dozen other states are considering legislation to ban or restrict abortion in various ways. Among the slew of strategies are trigger bans to make abortion completely illegal in a state should Roe v. Wade be overturned, as well as six-week abortion bans. Respond to Kemp, and then what’s happening across the country.
CECILE RICHARDS : Obviously, the hypocrisy of this, of just that clip you played, is underscored by the fact that in fact, there is a crisis in this country, and it is maternal mortality rates, which are the highest in the developed world. I actually believe Georgia has the second-highest rate of maternal death related to pregnancy of any state. So if there is actually a medical crisis in Georgia, it’s about women dying as a result of complications from childbirth. So that’s on the one side. If Governor Kemp actually wanted to do something about a real problem, that is something that they could address, but you hear him say nothing about that. And of course it’s higher for women of color—I think three times the rate for black women than it is for white women.
This bill, though—not only is it unconstitutional, and I believe will be declared so, but one of the things he doesn’t mention is that it actually criminalizes women as well. It doesn’t just make abortion illegal; it basically would allow women to be convicted and either sentenced to death or to life imprisonment in Georgia. So we are now going from not only making abortion illegal, but criminalizing women who make this decision that has been constitutional now for more than 40 years in the United States of America. And I think it directly relates back to the work we talked earlier about in Supermajority. I think women are tired of basically being seen as a special interest, as a side issue. These are issues that affect every single woman in this country.
AMY GOODMAN : So what exactly are you going to be doing? You talked about mobilizing women. Are you registering women?
CECILE RICHARDS : Well, I think eventually as we get into next year. But right now, women are raising their hands saying they want to be trained. And we actually just did a call yesterday with about 1,500 women, the first folks that signed up to do a call. They want to be trained in activism. They want to know how to actually affect legislation. And they absolutely are going to be part of designing a New Deal for Women so in this all-important presidential election, Amy, as well as all the other elections that are going to be going on, that candidates and anyone who wants to be elected has to respond to the issues that women care about. And so that will be a lot of the organizing work we’re doing both online and offline in the coming months.
AMY GOODMAN : Four Democratic women have now announced their plans to run for president. The significance of this for you? And will you be endorsing?
CECILE RICHARDS : I think the importance of—obviously, there’s no way to overstate the importance of women running for president, and I am thrilled that they are, and I think they are raising issues that have long been needed to be raised. I think it is disturbing to see what I believe is a real double standard in how they are being treated versus the many, many, many men that are running for president. You know, two thirds of political reporting is still done by men. And so I am hoping that both through Supermajority, through other folks that follow the media, we can actually be lifting up the important work that these women have done. As you probably know, these are women who in large part have never lost a political race. And so when people talk about women being unelectable, I think it’s really important look at their record, because it stands up really in contrast to a lot of the men who are actually in the race right now.
AMY GOODMAN : Today the House Ways and Means Committee is holding its first-ever hearing on paid family and medical leave. What do you want to see come out of this hearing?
CECILE RICHARDS : I think, one, it’s incredibly important that you are reporting that. I think it has been underreported. We are the only developed country with no nationally mandated family leave policy. This is an issue that every person in the country that I talk to raises—the difficulty of taking care of their families, of their children, of their loved ones, of their parents. I think the important thing, and where I believe Supermajority can play a real role, is lifting up what is happening in Congress so that anyone in the United States Senate is held accountable about where they vote on this issue. This should be and could be the first thing that the new president signs into law.
AMY GOODMAN : And just a correction—what I said earlier that you questioned—52% of white women voted for President Trump in 2016, although Pew put it at something like 47%, not 52%, of white women voted for Donald Trump according to the Pew Research Center. They found 45% voted for Hillary Clinton.
CECILE RICHARDS : Yeah, there have been different numbers come out. Definitely a plurality of white women. But one of the things I think is also worth looking at, Amy, is in this last election in 2018 where we elected a record number of women to Congress, a record number of women of color to Congress, actually for the first time in years, white women split their votes evenly between Democratic and Republican candidates. Now, that’s not true across the board; it depends on the state. But I do think there is really a growing recognition that there are opportunities to talk to women about the important issues they care about and how the candidates stand on those.
AMY GOODMAN : How is it that though there is a clear pro-choice majority in this country—
CECILE RICHARDS : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : —most states are imposing some kind of abortion ban?
CECILE RICHARDS : Well, because if you look at who’s actually—I mean, look at my home state of Texas, where we have had the most gerrymandered districts for years and have been fighting in court forever. So I would say the state legislatures in a lot of these states, including Texas, are not representative of the majority of people. You pile on that, as we know, the restrictions on voting for people in this country–Georgia, Texas, many, many states—we don’t have a representative democracy. One of the things we need in this country is we need democracy reform. And I know that’s something that Stacey Abrams is fighting for. Andrew Gillum, other folks. This is really important, because we can’t have a true democracy that represents a majority of people unless everybody can vote and every vote is counted.
AMY GOODMAN : Finally, how much does your mother, Ann Richards, the former governor of Texas, influence—her legacy influence what you’re doing today, moving from Planned Parenthood to Supermajority?
CECILE RICHARDS : Well, I would like to think that Ann Richards would be one of the early folks to sign up for Supermajority. She believed so profoundly in the importance of democracy representing all people. Not only women; people of color, and people who have been underrepresented. And I think that’s actually what most people in this country believe. And I’m grateful to mom. I’m grateful to the obviously centuries of women, people of color, of women of color who fought to make this a stronger democracy. And now it is on the rest of us to keep that going.
AMY GOODMAN : Cecile Richards, thanks so much for being with us. Co-founder of Supermajority, former president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.

"Headlines for May 08, 2019 | Democracy Now!",www.democracynow.org,,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/8/headlines,"Iran to Suspend Part of Nuclear Deal Citing U.S. Sanctions May 08, 2019
Iran has announced it will stop complying with parts of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal and resume high-level enrichment of uranium in 60 days if other signatories of the deal do not take action to shield Iran’s oil and and banking sectors from U.S. sanctions. This comes a year after the Trump administration pulled out of the nuclear deal. In a speech earlier today, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iran wants to stay in the nuclear deal but that it is rolling back its commitments due to Washington’s actions. In the short term, Rouhani said Iran would stop exporting excess uranium and heavy water from its nuclear program.
Hassan Rouhani : “The Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action, the JCPOA , is here and it remains in place. But today we have shown the flipside of the JCPOA coin. This is the same [nuclear deal] that states if the other parties are failing to meet their obligations, then we can also reduce our obligations in the deal. Today, we are announcing a reduction of our obligations under the deal. We are not leaving the [nuclear deal].”
Russia responded by blaming the United States for provoking Iran into rolling back the terms of the nuclear deal. The Iranian-American author Trita Parsi said, “Trump has initiated a chain reaction that will make America and the world less safe.” Topics: Pompeo Makes Surprise Visit to Iraq As U.S.-Iran Tensions Mount May 08, 2019
Iran’s announcement comes just days after the Trump administration moved to deploy a carrier strike group and a bomber task force to the region claiming there was a “credible threat by Iranian regime forces.” On Tuesday, U.S. officials announced four B-52 bombers would be part of the deployment. Meanwhile Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a surprise visit to Iraq on Tuesday to meet Iraq’s prime minister and discuss Iran’s presence in Iraq. UN Rapporteur Slams U.S. For Using Sanctions to Precipitate Humanitarian Disasters May 08, 2019
This comes as a high-ranking United Nations official is openly criticizing the United States for imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran Cuba, and Venezuela that could lead to mass starvation.
UN Special Rapporteur Idriss Jazairy said, “Real concerns and serious political differences between governments must never be resolved by precipitating economic and humanitarian disasters, making ordinary people pawns and hostages thereof.” A recent report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research and economist Jeffrey Sachs estimates 40,000 people may have died in Venezuela since 2017 because of U.S. sanctions. 1 Dead, 8 Injured in Colorado School Shooting Near Columbine May 08, 2019
In Colorado, an 18-year-old student was killed and eight were injured on Tuesday in a school shooting at the STEM School Highlands Ranch south of Denver. Authorities have taken two students into custody. Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock spoke to reporters outside the school.
Sheriff Tony Spurlock : “Two individuals walked into the STEM school, got deep inside the school and engaged students in two separate locations. … We do have eight students that are in area hospitals right now. Several of them are in critical condition. … Both of the suspects we believe are students of the STEM school. … They are not injured.”
The STEM School Highlands Ranch is located just seven miles from Columbine High School where 12 students and a teacher were shot dead 20 years ago on April 20, 1999. The school is also about 20 miles from Aurora Colorado where a gunman killed 20 people at a movie theater in 2012. Tuesday’s shooting in Colorado came a week after two students were killed and four were injured in a mass shooting at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. NYT : Trump’s Tax Records Show He Lost Over $1 Billion Between 1985 and 1994 May 08, 2019
The New York Times has obtained tax information on Donald Trump showing that his businesses lost $1.17 billion from 1985 to 1994. While Trump continues to refuse to release his tax returns, the Times obtained printouts from his official IRS tax transcripts for a 10-year period ending in 1994. In multiple years during that stretch Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual taxpayer in the country. In 1990 and 1991, Trump lost more than $250 million each year — more than double any other individual U.S. taxpayer, according to IRS documents. In eight of the 10 years Trump paid no federal income taxes. House Prepares to Hold Barr in Contempt as Justice Dept. Advises Trump to Invoke Executive Privilege May 08, 2019
Tension continues to escalate between Congressional Democrats and the Trump administration. The House Judiciary Committee is preparing to vote today on whether to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for failing to provide lawmakers with an unredacted copy of the Mueller report. The Justice Department is now advising Trump to invoke executive privilege over the entire unredacted report and underlying evidence. In related news, the White House has directed former counsel Don McGahn not to comply with a congressional subpoena to hand over documents related to the Russia probe. Meanwhile FBI Director Christopher Wray appears to have directly contradicted Attorney General William Barr on whether federal authorities spied on the Trump campaign in 2016. Last month Barr said “spying did occur.” On Tuesday Wray says he has not seen any evidence of illegal surveillance. Georgia Enacts One of Nation’s Most Restrictive Abortion Bans May 08, 2019
Georgia’s Republican governor Brian Kemp has signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The law bans abortion when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which often occurs at around six weeks into pregnancy before many women even realize they are pregnant. The new law goes into effect on Jan. 1. The American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood Southeast and the Center for Reproductive Rights have announced plans to challenge the abortion ban. Reproductive rights groups are also challenging “fetal heartbeat” bills that were recently passed in Mississippi and Kentucky. Uber & Lyft Drivers Strike Ahead of Uber’s Wall Street Debut May 08, 2019
In labor news Uber and Lyft drivers are planning to strike today in over a dozen cities ahead of Uber’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange. While Uber is expected to be valued as high as $90 billion dollars, the drivers say they have not benefited from Uber’s success, citing low earnings and no benefits. Uber driver Esterphanie St. Juste is taking part in the strike in Los Angeles.
Esterphanie St. Juste : “Well at first, you know, it was good because I was able to make probably I would say easily over a $1,000 a week and still have two days off so it seemed to make sense at the time. … Well now I haven’t had a day off since January because I can’t afford to have a day off.” Tens of Thousands of Teachers in Oregon to Walk Out of Classes May 08, 2019
Tens of thousands of teachers in Oregon are planning to walk out of classes today forcing at least 23 school districts to preemptively cancel school. The teachers are calling for legislators to increase school funding and reduce large class sizes. Sandra Bland’s Family Calls For Probe of Her Death to be Reopened After Cell Phone Footage is Aired May 08, 2019
The family of Sandra Bland is calling for authorities to reopen an investigation into her death. The 28-year-old African-American woman died in a Texas jail cell in 2015, three days after she was arrested for allegedly failing to signal a lane change. Authorities have claimed Sandra Bland committed suicide while in jail by hanging herself with a garbage bag, but her family has long rejected this claim. On Monday, the Dallas TV station WFAA aired cellphone video filmed by Bland capturing the moment when she was pulled over. In the 39-second video, you can see the officer — Brian Encinia — drawing his stun gun and saying, “I will light you up.” Attorneys for the Bland family say the cellphone video proves the officer lied when he had claimed he felt his safety was in jeopardy when he pulled over Sandra Bland. Pamela Anderson Visits Julian Assange in London Prison as He Fights Possible Extradition to U.S. May 08, 2019
The actress Pamela Anderson visited Wikileaks founder Julian Assange at the high-security Belmarsh Prison in London on Tuesday. Assange is serving a 50-week prison sentence for skipping bail in Britain and faces possible extradition to the United States to face charges related to the Chelsea Manning leaks. Pamela Anderson spoke outside the prison after seeing him.
Pamela Anderson : '’Obviously, it's been very difficult to see Julian here and to make our way through the prison, to get to him was quite shocking and difficult. He does not deserve to be in a supermax prison, he has never committed a violent act, he is an innocent person. … He’s sacrificed so much to bring the truth out and we deserve the truth and that’s all I can say. I’m sorry I just feel sick. I feel nauseous.”
Pamela Anderson was wearing a cloak covered with references to the history of free speech in Britain as well as prisons, tyranny and the Levellers. Trump Pardons Soldier Who Murdered Naked Unarmed Iraqi Prisoner May 08, 2019 Image Credit: Free Michael Behenna/Facebook
President Trump has pardoned a former U.S. soldier who was found guilty of “unpremeditated murder. ” In 2008 First Lt. Michael Behenna drove an unarmed Iraqi prisoner into the desert for an interrogation. He then stripped the prisoner naked, interrogated him at gunpoint and then shot him in the head and chest. Behenna was initially sentenced to 25 years in 2009. He was released on parole in 2014. Hina Shamsi of the American Civil Liberties Union criticized Trump’s move. She said, “This pardon is a presidential endorsement of a murder that violated the military’s own code of justice.” Topics: Iraq The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

Billion Dollar Loser: NYT Report on Trump’s Taxes & Massive Losses May Prompt Fraud Investigation | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/8/billion_dollar_loser_nyt_report_on,"Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , Democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman. In a major exposé, The New York Times has obtained tax information on Donald Trump that shows his businesses lost more than a billion dollars from 1985 to 1994. While Trump continues to refuse to release his tax returns, The Times obtained printouts from his official IRS tax transcripts for a 10-year period ending in ’94. In multiple years during that stretch, Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual taxpayer in the United States. In both 1990 and ’91, Trump lost more than $250 million, more than double any other individual U.S. taxpayer, according to IRS documents. In eight of the 10 years, Trump paid no federal income taxes.
To unpack these revelations, we are joined from Rochester, New York, by David Cay Johnston, the twice Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter formally with The New York Times , now founder and editor of DCReport.org_. He has been reporting on Donald Trump since the 1980s. His most recent book—_It’s Even Worse Than You Think: What the Trump Administration Is Doing to America . And he has just published a piece in The Daily Beast . It’s headlined Trump’s Tax Leak Hints at Potential Fraud Investigations . It begins, “The myth of Donald Trump the modern Midas who turns to gold all that he touches died Tuesday afternoon.”
David Cay Johnston, welcome back to Democracy Now! What were you most surprised by in this New York Times exposé? And explain exactly what they got a hold of. It wasn’t the actual tax returns of Donald Trump from the ’80s to ’90s. What was it?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : The Times got from a source who properly had them what are called tax transcripts. The IRS takes information from your tax return and puts it into a summary that tax agents work from. So it is the official numbers. And The Times has some of Fred Trump’s tax returns. Fred is Donald’s father. And the numbers line up perfectly for those areas where they would need to be consistent. So we can rely that this is highly accurate data on what Trump told the IRS in his tax returns.
AMY GOODMAN : Who would have access to this kind of information, David?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Oh, a lot of people. If you have taken out a mortgage, you signed a form saying that you submitted to having your tax information given to your lender. When Trump was raising money on Wall Street, he might have had to supply this. Litigants may have gotten it. And of course, his own family and staff and advisers would have this information. So there are numerous copies out there of this and other Trump tax information, just as with the 2005 Trump tax return that was mailed to my home here in Rochester.
AMY GOODMAN : So talk about exactly what has been exposed. He lost more than a billion dollars, more than any U.S. taxpayer?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Yes. Almost two cents of every dollar reported as losses one year by everyone in the United States were reported by Donald Trump. And what this shows is something I’ve been saying and writing about Trump for 30 years: he is a terrible businessman. His business model is not to get an enterprise, to nurture it, to grow it, to make it more profitable over time. His business model is the same as a mob bust-out. Get your hands on an enterprise, squeeze all the cash out of it, don’t pay your vendors, try to cheat as best you can your employees, don’t pay the bankers—and Trump once said, “I borrowed money knowing I wouldn’t pay it back”—and then leave the carcass and go on to the next deal.
That’s why the Art of the Deal is so significant in all of this, because Trump’s business model is to rip off one person after another who gets involved with him thinking he will make them wealthy while he is destroying their wealth. Donald is, after Bernie Madoff, arguably the greatest wealth destroyer in American history.
AMY GOODMAN : President Trump tweeted at 4:00 a.m. this morning, Eastern time, “Real estate developers in the 1980’s & 1990’s, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases. Much was non monetary. Sometimes considered “tax shelter,” you would get it by building, or even buying. You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes....almost all real estate developers did–and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport. Additionally, the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!,” Trump tweeted, 4:00 this morning. Your response, David Cay Johnston?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Well, buildings are depreciated by owners and many big real estate developers routinely report losses on their tax returns. But Donald didn’t have anywhere near the value in the buildings he controlled to take the kind of losses you are seeing. And he doesn’t mention things like he bought the old Eastern Air Lines Shuttle with its broken-down, aging, gas-guzzling jets and lost $7 million a month, and did numerous other business deals where he just lost money left and right. So he has taken a little element of truth—if you’re a major real estate family, you probably don’t pay income taxes—and tried to make that cover all this other stuff in terms of losses that are way out of proportion.
But more importantly, Donald Trump held himself out as this great dealmaker, this genius businessman. He pushed himself into the front of the pantheon of the economic heroes who were lionized in the '80s for making money without any regard to how they made it, when he didn't belong in their league at all. To those of us who have been covering him closely and not buying at the surface what he says but checking the facts, the broad story here isn’t true. The size of the losses, however, is stupendous. Much larger than I ever imagined.
AMY GOODMAN : Who was backing him? Talk about the banks. And there seems to be some unexplained large sum of money that he got at that time, $52.9 million.
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Yeah. Trump reported one year almost $53 million of interest. Now, if he held treasury notes, that means he had over $660 million of treasury bonds. And if it were junk bonds, more than $350 million. We know from other things that Trump had to disclose over the years that he didn’t have a portfolio anywhere like that. So the question is, did he report some income that was from some other source he was trying to hide as interest? And then the question would be, was it benign or nefarious?
And I would point out that this was during or right after the period when we know that Donald Trump was very deeply entangled with the international cocaine trafficker Joseph Wexelbaum. So deeply entangled and did so many favors for him that I’ve said, and I’ll say again, the only logical explanation for his conduct is that Donald was in the cocaine trafficking business with Joe Wexelbaum. And Donald, if you’re listening, sue me if you think you can prove what I just said isn’t true.
The backers of Trump were banks up until 1990 when he could not pay his bills as they came due. And Donald and I had a conversation one day where I said, “So how much are you worth, Donald?”“Three billion dollars.” I said, “I don’t believe you.” And he was agitated about that. But I said, “Donald, I’m a reporter. I’m a journalist. I can pay my bills as they come due. If you actually had $3 billion, you would find a way to pay your bills.” By the way, later that day he told another reporter he was worth $5 billion, which tells you that he just makes this up.
He is a con artist. He’s a criminal. He is a fraud. And once the banks realized that they had been had, nobody would loan money to him anymore, except Deutsche Bank, which was the preferred bank for Russian oligarchs—that is the criminal gang around Vladimir Putin—to launder their money.
AMY GOODMAN : You have written that Congress should investigate fully what we know Trump was—that Trump was faking his wealth and may have been vulnerable to foreign espionage. You also say the new reporting by The Times also hints at what may be more Trump tax fraud in which there is no statute of limitations when it is criminal rather than civil. What does that mean, criminal?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Well, we don’t seriously enforce the criminal tax laws in this country. There are over 150 million tax returns filed this year and there will be maybe 800 prosecutions, and many of those will be connected to either drug trafficking or bribing politicians. It is one of the major shortcomings in our law. But Donald Trump had two civil tax fraud trials and he lost both of them. And at one of them, his own longtime tax lawyer and accountant, who was also his father’s tax lawyer and accountant, Jack Mitnick, testified under oath “that’s my signature on the tax return but neither I nor my firm prepared that tax return.” That is criminal tax fraud.
And that Donald Trump was not prosecuted at the time goes to how he has been very effective at hiring lawyers to intimidate journalists, to persuade governments that he is not worth the time to go after and cheat the system. So if Congress gets its hands on his tax returns—and I’m confident they will, and if not, they will get his returns from New York State, which are virtually identical—I am sure they will show that Donald Trump, like Richard Nixon, is a criminal tax cheat. And let’s remember Richard Nixon’s lawyer went to prison. The only reason Richard Nixon didn’t go to prison was he was pardoned by Gerry Ford.
AMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you very much for being with us. A small correction—I said Trump tweeted at 4:00 a.m. this morning; it was actually 7:00 a.m. It was 4:00 a.m. California time.
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : I want to make a second—I only have one Pulitzer, Amy.
AMY GOODMAN : OK. [laugh]. Two corrections, there. David Cay Johnston, I want to thank you so much for being with us.

Activists and lawmakers testified last week before a House Judiciary subcommittee in the first congressional hearings on the Equal Rights Amendment in more than 35 years. The constitutional amendment was approved by Congress in 1972, and was ratified by 35 states over the next decade — three states short of the required total needed by a 1982 deadline. Nevada and Illinois have since ratified the amendment. A bill by Rep. Jackie Spear would eliminate the 1982 deadline, leaving the ERA just one state away from becoming a part of the U.S. Constitution.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman. “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” Those are the words of the Equal Rights Amendment, which may be heading toward ratification decades after it was first considered by the American public following a powerful hearing on Capitol Hill last week. Activists and lawmakers testified before a House Judiciary subcommittee in the first Congressional hearings on the ERA in more than 35 years. The constitutional amendment was approved by Congress in 1972 and was ratified by 35 states over the next decade, three states short of the required total needed by a 1982 deadline. Nevada and Illinois have since ratified the amendment. A bill by Congressmember Jackie Speier would eliminate the 1982 deadline, leaving the ERA just one state away from becoming a part of the U.S. Constitution. This is actor and activist Patricia Arquette speaking at the hearing.
PATRICIA ARQUETTE : Why didn’t women achieve full constitutional equality in 1787 or 1982? Because the country wasn’t ready? Well, I hope you’re ready now! Because women have been waiting 232 years for equality in this country and it has failed them. Legislators have blocked the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment for decades. But we’re done waiting.
AMY GOODMAN : For more, we’re joined by the co-presidents and CEOs of the ERA Coalition/Fund for Women’s Equality, Carol Jenkins and Jessica Neuwirth. Jessica Neuwirth is also the author of the book Equal Means Equal: Why the Time for an Equal Rights Amendment is Now . Carol Jenkins and Jessica Neuwirth, we welcome you both to Democracy Now! Carol, let’s begin with you. What is it that you see could happen in 2019, 2020 that hasn’t happened in U.S. history?
CAROL JENKINS : Well, two things. The Coalition is now working on two ways forward to the ERA being ratified. One is we need the 38th state. We think we’re very close to that. We got as far as 37 and a half states. Virginia’s Senate passed it; the House denied it. So we call that getting as close as you can get, without getting there. We think Virginia will be the next possibility for us as well. There is an election in November, and if they manage to turn the state blue, they could take up the ERA again in January. So we’re just that close. The other states, 13 unratified states, all working for that. The reason that we were in the Judiciary Committee last week was to get Jackie Speier’s bill marked up and voted on, and that would be the removal of the deadline completely, which is a barrier to the conversation. Not necessarily a barrier to ratification, but to the conversation about the Equal Rights Amendment.
AMY GOODMAN : Jessica Neuwirth, you have been organizing and writing about this for decades. Explain the history of the Equal Rights Amendment, especially for young people who may have no idea what this is all about.
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : I was in college when the 1982 deadline passed, so I wasn’t an active part, actually, of the first wave of ERA activism in the 1970s. But really it goes all the way back to 1923, right after women got the right to vote in 1920, and Alice Paul and others drafted the Equal Rights Amendment. It was introduced in 1923, finally passed in 1972. I think there’s just a long history of movement. And it came so close—even in 1982, just three states. And if you talk to people who were active then, it was literally just a handful of votes in a couple of states that made the difference. So now with the power of social media and all of these new young women and men who have grown up really in a different culture where I think this is not only a no-brainer, it is just absurd to them that we don’t have constitutional equality. Which is also true around the world. I think people look at us and they just don’t understand why we wouldn’t have this basic provision in our Constitution, which almost every other constitution has.
AMY GOODMAN : So let me go to the testimony, the hearing that took place last week. I want to go to the House Judiciary Committee hearing. In her opening remarks, Kathleen Sullivan said the U.S. Constitution is exceptional in not including a gender equality clause.
KATHLEEN SULLIVAN : The United States Constitution, the world’s oldest written constitution, is also the only major written constitution in the world that lacks a provision declaring that men and women are equal. And now is the chance to correct that omission, that stain, that embarrassment about our Constitution, through the ratification by just one more state of the 1972 amendment. Just to give some examples, the French constitution provides that the law guarantees to the women in all spheres rights equal to those of men. The German constitution provides that men and women have equal rights, and that nobody shall be prejudiced or favored because of their sex. The Constitution of India provides that the state shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds of sex. And every written constitution promulgated since World War II contains a sex equality provision.
AMY GOODMAN : How is it possible that the ERA hasn’t been passed, Carol Jenkins? Talk about that history. And what polls do you have showing how many Americans—what percentage of Americans support this?
CAROL JENKINS : Well, the research that we’ve done indicates that 94 percent of all Americans of every color, political persuasion, age support equality—constitutional equality—for women. The problem is that 80 percent of those people think that we already have it. They cannot believe that in the United States, we do not have this in our Constitution. So I think that it has been a long journey, almost 100 years, if we get this, since Alice Paul introduced it in 1923, that we have been on this march towards equality.
AMY GOODMAN : What states are you focusing on, if it’s just one state away?
CAROL JENKINS : If it’s just one state away, we’re looking at Virginia. Louisiana has a possibility. Arizona. They all say—and we put it in the terms of there is the math and there is the magic. The math in many instances is against us just by a little bit, or by a lot. But magically, what could happen if a person who has not supported the ERA suddenly wakes up and says, “It’s time for this to happen. It’s just unconscionable that the Constitution of the United States does not include women.”
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about intersectionality and the ERA ? The importance of African-American leadership around the ERA ?
CAROL JENKINS : Well, we are at this moment because of women of color, because of black women. Pat Spearman in 2017 magically got Nevada to ratify the ERA . And those of us who had been working on this for years looked at each other and we said, “Does this count?” And our legal people said, “Yes, it does count.” And then the next year, Illinois did the same thing. Extraordinary. Juliana Stratton, who’s now the lieutenant governor there, was a powerful voice in the Illinois House to make sure that the ERA got passed. And now in Virginia, we have several black women who are in the forefront, including Jennifer McClellan in the Senate, Jennifer Carroll Foy, who was the chief sponsor in the House of Delegates. And remember, we came so close. That was shockingly close. One vote away from the ERA .
AMY GOODMAN : Jessica Neuwirth, how does the ERA address transgender discrimination?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : The ERA prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. And right now, actually, the Supreme Court has a case—has taken a case, and will decide what that word means, and whether it includes transgender.
AMY GOODMAN : Let me go back to 1976. This is Good Morning America hosting a debate between Phyllis Schlafly and Betty Friedan, on the Equal Rights Amendment. This is conservative activist Schlafly, who was at the time the chairwoman of the Stop ERA campaign.
PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY : The ERA is a big attack on the rights of the homemaker. The laws of every state make it the obligation of the husband to support his wife, to provide her with a home, to support their minor children. The woman in the home can draw social security benefits based on her husband’s earnings, even though she has been a homemaker all her life. Now, all these things will be lost when you apply a rule that says that everything must be equal. Now until you can make it equal for men to have the babies just like women, then it is a double burden to the women to say that the rules for family support should be equal on the husband and the wife. ERA ends up in taking away the right of the wife to be supported by her husband.
AMY GOODMAN : So that’s Phyllis Schlafly. You’re smiling right now.
CAROL JENKINS : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : The conservative activist who tried to and successfully stopped the ERA .
CAROL JENKINS : Yes. The good old days.
AMY GOODMAN : But that is what someone is going to have to say if they’re going to say no to it today. Talk about why you feel it is critical today and even talk about your own story. You were a famous newscaster. You’re a journalist. The lack of pay equity.
CAROL JENKINS : Well, precisely. When people say to us, “Why would you need the equal rights amendment?” I say, “Look at our country.” Who are the poor people in our country? It’s the women in this country. Families headed by women who cannot feed their children, cannot find homes. They are homeless. They are impoverished. Corporations have made billions and billions of dollars by paying women less than they pay men. It is a good business strategy, but it’s a very poor strategy for equality in this country. So we cannot go on diminishing the rights of women in the United States. How many years have we done this, you know, Pay Equity Day? It is so infuriating. It doesn’t change.
AMY GOODMAN : Explain Pay Equity Day. We just passed it.
CAROL JENKINS : Right. It’s the amount of time—the date at which in the next year a woman or a woman of color, a black woman, Latina woman would equalize what a white man made the year before. For Latina women, it’s November. I mean, that is almost a full year of working before she matches that income. It’s a disgrace. And so we think that pay equity, that eligibility to recourse in sexual and domestic abuse, pregnancy discrimination—these are all things that would be affected by the ERA .
AMY GOODMAN : Jessica Neuwirth, how are you moving forward on this right now? What’s the actual organizing going on, on the ground? And what would change? Carol was just describing pay disparities. What would it mean to have this amendment in the Constitution?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : Well, just one example. Phyllis Schlafly talked about women who are in the home. More and more women are in the workforce and there are some women who never could afford to be in the home. And one of the many reasons we need the ERA , as Carol mentioned, is pregnancy discrimination. There are women who are getting fired every day because they’re taking too many bathroom breaks while they’re pregnant. They have no effective legal recourse. So I think the ERA would give women in areas like pregnancy discrimination, gender-based violence, recourse that they have been denied in many, many cases and continue to be denied. And at the same time, I think it is really important for us at a higher level to put in the foundational document of our country and in the bedrock of law that women are equal, and to finally send out the message we’re no longer going to be treated as second-class citizens. And in terms of organizing, it has been an explosion across the country. What we see is this groundswell.
AMY GOODMAN : What has to happen first? We have 30 seconds.
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : So what has to happen is we need the committee, the Judiciary Committee, to do a markup and a vote. We need the House and the Senate to remove the deadline. And we need one more state.
AMY GOODMAN : The Senate is Republican. Would they approve it?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : Well, we’re just two votes away, we think, from a majority in the Senate, which is what we need. Just two more Republicans. And I think we’ll get there.
CAROL JENKINS : Senator Cardin and Lisa Murkowski are sponsoring the bill to remove the deadline in the Senate. Susan Collins has signed on. So we’re working on Republican support as a bipartisan issue.
AMY GOODMAN : We will certainly continue to follow this. Carol Jenkins, Jessica Neuwirth, co-presidents of the ERA Coalition/Fund for Women’s Equality.

Supermajority: Cecile Richards Teams With Alicia Garza & Ai-jen Poo to Mobilize Women Voters in 2020,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/8/supermajority_cecile_richards_teams_with_alicia,"co-founder of Supermajority and former president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman. As the 2020 election season heats up, we turn now to the launch of a new political action group by three prominent women’s rights activists. It’s called Supermajority. Its goal is to train a new generation of women activists to take on grassroots campaigns and electoral politics.
PERSON : Women are the majority of Americans.
PERSON : We are the majority of voters.
PERSON : We are the majority of grassroots volunteers and donors.
PERSON : Our government should look like this.
PERSON : [translated] Our government should look like us.
PERSON : [translated] Our leaders should fight for us.
PERSON : The only way we can make that happen is by standing shoulder-to-shoulder—
PERSON : —with women who believe this, too.
CECILE RICHARDS : Maybe you have fought for change for decades.
ALICIA GARZA : Demanding equality in your home, in your workplace, from your government.
PERSON : Maybe you’re just getting started.
PERSON : Let’s work together.
PERSON : Supermajority is a new organization for women who want to build our collective power and use it to change this country for good.
PERSON : Because one of us can be dismissed.
PERSON : Two of us can be ignored. But together—
PERSON : We aren’t just the majority.
ALICIA GARZA : We are a supermajority. And we are unstoppable. Let’s make sure the entire country knows it.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s the promotional video for Supermajority. The new political action group was founded by Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza; Ai-jen Poo, the executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance; and former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, who joins us now in our studio. Cecile, welcome back to Democracy Now! . First time in this position, as one of the heads of Supermajority.
CECILE RICHARDS : Well, one of the founders. I think there’s so many women now that are coming out of the woodwork to do this work.
AMY GOODMAN : So explain what you’re doing.
CECILE RICHARDS : I spent 12 years at Planned Parenthood organizing women around a certain set of issues, particularly reproductive health and healthcare access. My colleagues, Alicia and Ai-jen, have been doing the same work with different groups of women. And we realized that actually there are even millions more women that we haven’t organized and that, particularly since this election, have been raising their hand and saying, “I want to do more. I’ve never been civically engaged. I’ve never been politically involved.”
And so we’ve spent the last few months actually traveling across the country listening to women about what they need and want. And what they want is they want to be activists. And as you saw in the video, I think there is a sense that women are—we’re the majority of voters. Fifty-Four percent of voters last election were women. We are the volunteers. We are increasingly the donors, increasingly the candidates, and it is time for political equity. So that’s the idea behind Supermajority. We want to build a multiracial, intergenerational movement to increase women’s power, political power and civil engagement.
AMY GOODMAN : You’ve talked about a New Deal for Women.
CECILE RICHARDS : Well, that’s what I think. And I think Alicia and Ai-jen would say the same, which is, women again do most of the work around political campaigns and candidates, and yet the issues that women talk to us about on the road—the lack of affordable child care in the United States, the fact that maternal mortality rates are at epidemic levels, the fact that equal pay gets a lot of lip service but we never actually make progress— these are issues that we believe need to be front and center of any political campaign. And although I’m so grateful that there are so many women running for president raising these issues, they need to be raised by anybody who wants to be president of the United States.
AMY GOODMAN : How did you come up with the title Supermajority?
CECILE RICHARDS : I guess it’s just that women, I think, aren’t just the majority; I think women have superpowers, and they’ve been expressing that and showing that. And I think actually I think it has kind of caught on. In fact, just—we launched I guess a week ago, and we’ve now had more than 80,000 folks sign up, and that’s before we really even begin to get on the road. So I feel like there’s a real need and interest in the country, particularly among women who want to become better activists, more effective activists. They want to know what other women are doing and how they can support them as well.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to Alicia Garza. Alicia is away, so we were not able to bring her on with you today. Alicia Garza, co-founder of Black Lives Matter. In 2017, she spoke on Democracy Now! about how women of color must be included in political organizing, especially against sexual assault and harassment.
ALICIA GARZA : The reality is, women of color, immigrant women, black women who are low-wage workers are extremely vulnerable to this kind of abuse and violence. And frankly, because of the lack of protections that exist, or to be honest, the marginalization that these communities already experience in our society, in our economy and in our democracy, there really is not only not conversation about the prevalence in which this is happening to women of color and immigrant women in the service industry, but there is also not a lot of conversation about what do the solutions look like outside of criminalizing the perpetrators or the survivors themselves. And so it was very important—
AMY GOODMAN : So that’s Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza, who is one of the co-founders of this new organization, with Cecile Richards and Ai-jen Poo, called Supermajority. So how do you organize this multiracial coalition? I mean, when it came to voting in 2016, wasn’t it something like 62% of white women voted for President Trump?
CECILE RICHARDS : I don’t think that is the number, but definitely a plurality of white women voted for President Trump. Look, I think that this is work that women want to do, not only to learn how to be better activists, to work across issues, but also to work across race lines. Because I think there is a real recognition among a lot of white women that we cannot continue to rely on women of color to sort of save this country or save us from ourselves, and it is important that we do this work as well and intentionally and in a multiracial way.
I’ve been an organizer my whole life, Amy, and so this is to me a very important and exciting moment where I’m seeing women across the country—in Midwestern states, in Southwestern states—come into rooms with women they’ve never met before and say, “This is the most exciting thing I’ve ever been able to do, is actually meet with women who also care passionately about the same issues I do, and we need to do this work together.” I’m so glad you had the clip from Alicia. I think she is one of the most phenomenal leaders in this country. And Ai-jen as well. But there are thousands and thousands more, and that is really what we’re seeking to do, is to make sure that these women’s voices are being lifted up, that they are feeling empowered and supported and that they can be active in getting other women involved.
AMY GOODMAN : What will be the role of unions? Supermajority Education Fund’s leadership committee includes Mary Kay Henry—
CECILE RICHARDS : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : —the international president of SEIU . How will you reach into unions?
CECILE RICHARDS : Of course, I came out of the labor movement, so I have enormous respect for the work that not only the labor movement is doing particularly, and the teachers’ movement. As we know, there have been wildcat strikes by teachers, overwhelmingly who are women, across the country.
AMY GOODMAN : Oregon teachers are striking today.
CECILE RICHARDS : It shouldn’t be on the public school teachers of this country to save the public education system, but this is where we see, over and over again, women basically taking action where government is failing them. So absolutely the teachers, the labor unions. They also, the majority of these organizations are women, and they want to work across issue lines as well. And I am really grateful to Mary Kay for being an important leader in not only the labor movement but in understanding that we can build the power of women across this country.
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask you about a comment of the new head of the NRA , Carolyn Meadows. She is there because Oliver North was just ousted. She apologized after coming under fire for attacking fellow Georgian, Democratic freshman Congressmember Lucy McBath, who lost her son to gun violence a few years ago—Jordan Davis, in Florida. He was a teenager who was shot dead when he was sitting in a car in a gas station parking lot. Meadows said, “The reason Lucy McBath won was not because she was anti-gun, but because she was a minority female.” Your thoughts?
CECILE RICHARDS : Well of course that was one of the worst—there are so many things about this—obviously—let me go back. Lucy McBath is a national hero. The fact that a woman who went through what she did, lost her child and then committed herself to addressing the criminal justice system in this country is phenomenal. And the fact that she is in Congress is so fantastic. Of course, she was elected in a majority Anglo district. She was not elected because she was a woman of color, but frankly despite the fact that she was a woman of color. And I think it is an enormous testament to her, to her candidacy, to her leadership. And it’s also a testimony to the important role that Stacey Abrams is playing and has played in the state of Georgia to increase participation of all people, but particularly people of color.
Because you opened the topic of Georgia—which I hope we will talk about in a minute, because of this outrageous bill that has been now signed by the governor—I spent time in Georgia with Stacey. Obviously, if every person in that state had been allowed to vote and if their vote had been counted, Stacey Abrams would be governor today and would be serving as well is having Lucy McBath in Congress.

Kill List Exposed: Leaked Obama Memo Shows Assassination of U.S. Citizens “Has No Geographic Limit” | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2013/2/5/kill_list_exposed_leaked_obama_memo,"Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : The Obama administration’s internal legal justification for assassinating U.S. citizens without charge has been revealed for the first time. According to a secret Justice Department document obtained by NBC News, the Obama administration claims it has the legal authority to target citizens who are, quote, “senior operational leaders,” of al-Qaeda or “an associated force” — even if there’s no intelligence indicating they are engaged in an active plot to attack the U.S.
In September 2011, a U.S. drone strike in Yemen killed two American citizens: Anwar al-Awlaki and Samir Khan. The following month, another U.S. drone strike killed al-Awlaki’s 16-year-old son Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, who was born in Denver.
AMY GOODMAN : The document obtained by NBC News is described as a “white memo” that was provided to members of the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees as a summary of a classified memo prepared by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. Last month, a federal judge denied a request by the American Civil Liberties Union and The New York Times for the Justice Department to disclose its legal justification for the targeted killing of Americans.
The Obama administration’s secrecy around the drone program is expected to be a top issue at this week’s confirmation hearing of White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan to be director of the CIA . Brennan has been dubbed by critics to be Obama’s “assassination czar.”
Joining us now is Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the ACLU and director of the ACLU’s Center for Democracy.
You’ve looked at the white memo. This is something you’ve been asking for for quite some time, Jameel. Talk about its significance. Go through it with us point by point.
JAMEEL JAFFER : Sure. Well, it’s a very significant document, and it’s a remarkable document, and it’s something that everybody really ought to read, in the same way that everybody ought to read the torture memos from the last administration. It sets out, or professes to set out, the power that the government has to carry out the targeted killing of American citizens who are located far away from any battlefield, even when they have not been charged with a crime, even when they do not present any imminent threat in any ordinary meaning of that word. So it’s a pretty sweeping power that’s been set out. And the memo purports to provide a legal justification for that power and explain why the limits on that power can’t be enforced in any court.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : The confidential Justice Department white paper that you’re talking about, Jameel Jaffer, introduces a more expansive definition of “self-defense” or “imminent attack” than any articulated by the U.S. government before. It reads, quote: “The condition that an operational leader present an 'imminent' threat of violent attack against the United States does not require the United States to have clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future.” Can you talk about the significance of that and how exactly “imminent” is defined in this document—
JAMEEL JAFFER : Sure.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : —or not defined?
JAMEEL JAFFER : Yeah, well, I mean, I think you—you know, you have to start with the acknowledgment that there are circumstances in which the government has the authority, and maybe even the responsibility, to use lethal force. Even if you think about it domestically—somebody is running down the street, waving a gun around, threatening civilians—the government doesn’t have to go to a judge beforehand to seek a warrant to carry out that use of lethal force. But that’s a situation in which the threat is imminent, in the ordinary meaning of the term: There’s not time to go to a judge; there’s not time for deliberation.
But the kind of imminence that the government is defining here, or the way that the government has defined the term here, is much, much broader. They’re talking about situations in which the person presents no immediate threat, there’s no known plot. These people are located far away from any actual battlefield, so you’re not talking about a situation in which there are battlefield exigencies that the government has to worry about. You’re really talking about something that looks a lot more like a law enforcement context. And in that context, the traditional rule is the government has the authority to use lethal force only in very narrow circumstances. And this memo really redefines those circumstances entirely.
AMY GOODMAN : Let’s turn to Attorney General Eric Holder, a comment he made last March when he outlined what the White House billed as the legal rationale for its claimed right to kill U.S. citizens who belong to al-Qaeda or associated forces.
ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER : It is an unfortunate but undeniable fact that some of the threats that we face come from a small number of United States citizens who have decided to commit violent attacks against their own country from abroad. Based on generations-old legal principles and Supreme Court decisions handed down during World War II, as well as during this current conflict, it’s clear that United States citizenship alone does not make—does not make such individuals immune from being targeted.
AMY GOODMAN : Jameel Jaffer, respond to Attorney General Eric Holder.
JAMEEL JAFFER : Well, it’s not a question of immunity. This is kind of a straw man. Nobody is arguing that Americans are entirely immune from the government’s use of lethal force. The question is: Under what circumstances can the government use lethal force? And again, for a very good reason, those circumstances have traditionally been defined very narrowly. Now what the government is doing is creating an extremely broad category of people who can be targeted without judicial review before the fact, without judicial assessment of the evidence after the fact. It’s a very dangerous thing that the government is doing.
And I think that at some level, I think the people who have written this memo and the people who are exercising this authority in the Obama administration must be convinced of their own trustworthiness. But even if you accept that the people who are now in office are trustworthy in this sense, this power is going to be available to the next administration and the one after that, and it’s going to be available in every future conflict, not just the conflict against al-Qaeda. And according to the administration, the power is available all over the world, not just on geographically cabined battlefields. So it really is a sweeping proposition.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : But what does it mean, though, that it’s not an official legal memo, it’s a white paper? Does that have any legal significance or implications?
JAMEEL JAFFER : Well, you know, some people have been saying that this is a kind of transparency that the administration, through these kinds of leaks, is giving the public the ability to assess the strength of the administration’s legal arguments. And the truth is that this is really just a briefing document, it’s not a legal memo. It does tell us a little bit about the authority that the government is claiming, but the actual legal memos are still secret. We’ve been litigating for those memos now for 18 months or two years. The administration has refused to release them. We have just appealed one case to the 2nd Circuit here in New York, to the appeals court here in New York.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Can you explain the case? What is the case that your organization, the ACLU , is—
JAMEEL JAFFER : So, there are two—there are two Freedom of Information Act cases that we’re litigating right now. One is—one is here in New York, and the other one is in D.C. One of them is an effort to get the legal memos. We’re litigating that case with The New York Times ; they have a parallel request. The other case, which is in D.C., is about, principally, civilian casualties, the question of who has been killed in these—in these drone strikes, because the administration has not released numbers. And we’re reliant on the work of very good organizations outside the administration to do that kind of work. We think that the administration should release its own numbers. So—
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And “who has been killed,” you mean U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizen who have been killed.
JAMEEL JAFFER : Right, absolutely. So, most of the people who are being killed in these drone strikes aren’t U.S. citizens, right? There have only been four U.S. citizens—three in 2011, one in 2002. The rest have been noncitizens killed, some of them in Pakistan, some of them in Yemen, some of them in Somalia. According to the figures of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism in the U.K., we’re now talking about somewhere on the order of 4,000 people who have been killed with these drones.
And the administration still hasn’t released the legal memos that purport to justify that program. So, one of the cases that we’re litigating, the one here in New York, is the effort to get that justification. This memo, this briefing paper, provides us a little more information about that justification, but it’s not the justification itself. For the same reasons that the government was right in 2009 to release the torture memos, we think the government should release the targeted killing memo.
AMY GOODMAN : Let’s get specific. I saw you in Sundance at one of the premieres of Jeremy Scahill and Rick Rowley’s film called Dirty Wars: The World Is a Battlefield . And it tells the story, among others, of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, 16-year-old kid born in Denver, killed in a drone strike two weeks after his father was killed in a drone strike in Yemen. Talk about his case and how this relates.
JAMEEL JAFFER : Right.
AMY GOODMAN : When does the U.S. stop? What is the justification for killing this 16-year-old boy?
JAMEEL JAFFER : Well, so two things about that. First, I think one of the most chilling aspects of the power that the government is claiming here is that they’re claiming the authority to do all of this in secret, not just keep it secret from the courts or keep their justification secret from the courts, but keep the exercise of this power secret, so they can carry out these killings of American citizens, among many others, without even acknowledging to the public or to any court that they have exercised that authority. And that really is a chilling proposition. But that’s one thing, and that’s one of the things that they’ve done in the Abdulrahman case: They have failed to acknowledge that they actually carried out this killing, although everybody knows it to be true.
But we have other litigation which we’re doing with the Center for Constitutional Rights. It’s a constitutional case on behalf of the three U.S. citizens who were killed in 2011, including Abdulrahman, the 16-year-old. And that’s a case in which we are raising claims under the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment, the due process clause, arguing that the government does not have the right, again, except in these extremely narrow circumstances, to carry out targeted killings without judicial review. And the government’s response to that lawsuit has not been to defend their authority on the merits. They’re not actually saying, “We have the right to do this.” They haven’t actually filed any of those arguments in court. Instead what they’re arguing is: This question of whether the government acted lawfully or not is a political question committed to the political branches, and the judges have no role to play, no role whatsoever to play, in assessing whether the killing of an American citizen was lawful or not.
AMY GOODMAN : How does it stop? Where does it stop? You kill them in Yemen, American citizens and others—no trial, no charge. What about in the United States?
JAMEEL JAFFER : There’s no line. You know, if you look at the memo, the briefing paper that was released yesterday, there’s no geographic line. And you can remember how most of the country reacted when President Bush declared the authority to hold American citizens detained in the United States: Most of the country said, “You can’t be serious. You’re going to treat the United States as part of the battlefield. You’re going to detain American citizens inside the United States as enemy combatants.” And now, the Obama administration—you know, if you accept the memo on its face, you accept the briefing paper on its face, the Obama administration is making, in some ways, a greater claim of authority. They’re arguing that the authority to kill American citizens has no geographic limit.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : I want to turn to comments made by John Brennan, John Brennan who is Obama’s counterterrorism adviser and now his pick for CIA director. He made these comments last May and publicly confirmed that the United States has used drones to conduct targeted killings overseas.
JOHN BRENNAN : President Obama believes that, done carefully, deliberately and responsibly, we can be more transparent and still ensure our nation’s security. So let me say it as simply as I can: Yes, in full accordance with the law, and in order to prevent terrorist attacks on the United States and to save American lives, the United States government conducts targeted strikes against specific al-Qaeda terrorists, sometimes using remotely piloted aircraft often referred to publicly as “drones.” And I’m here today because President Obama has instructed us to be more open with the American people about these efforts.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : That was Obama’s nominee for CIA director, John Brennan, speaking last May. Jameel Jaffer, your comments on what he said about drone attacks?
JAMEEL JAFFER : Well, this is—this is, I think, you know, in some ways, good timing for the release of this briefing paper, because, you know, as you mentioned, John Brennan has been nominated to head the CIA . There’s going to be a vote on his nomination later this week. And some senators have said that the nomination should not go forward unless the administration is more forthcoming with its legal analysis, unless they release the OLC memo. And I think that’s exactly right. The administration should release that memo. There are also open questions about the role that Brennan played in the torture program, and those questions, too, ought to be answered before the vote goes forward. So, you know, I think it’s good timing. There are some very serious questions that ought to be asked by—
AMY GOODMAN : Do you think the Democrats will be asking these questions of a Democratic administration?
JAMEEL JAFFER : Well, you know, there were a group of senators yesterday that wrote to the administration asking for the release of the legal memo and seeming to connect the release of the legal memo to—to these votes, to the Hagel vote and to the Brennan vote. And I think that that’s an important thing. And it was a group led by Senator Wyden. So I think that there—you know, there are definitely senators who think this is important. And if people can make it known to their senators that they think it’s important, I think that would be a very good thing.
AMY GOODMAN : And your thoughts on John Brennan being the CIA pick? Already, four years ago, when President Obama wanted to do it the first time around, he was forced to withdraw his name because there was such outcry.
JAMEEL JAFFER : Well, right. I mean, I definitely have reservations about it. I think that there are these questions, these important questions about his role in the torture program. And also, you know, people have said that John Brennan is an advocate for transparency about the drone program. If that’s true, now is the right time to release the OLC memo, the legal counsel memo. And I think that the debate about his nomination should be informed by whatever’s in that memo.
AMY GOODMAN : We had a report in headlines about Open Society Justice Initiative—and you’re a fellow at the Open Society right now, on leave from the ACLU—putting out a new report that’s revealed a detailed look at global involvement in the CIA’s secret program of prisons, rendition and torture since 9/11. The initiative says 54 countries aided the CIA until President Obama stopped the program in 2009. It’s called “Globalizing Torture,” also reveals at least 136 people were held by the CIA during those years—the largest tally to date. How significant is this?
JAMEEL JAFFER : I think it’s a hugely significant report. I think it’s the most comprehensive report thus far about the people who are held by the CIA and what happened to them, and also the complicity of other countries in the CIA’s program. Some of those other countries have begun to grapple with the question of accountability for their role in that program. As you know, the United States has not. The Obama administration has interfered with civil suits that seek to hold officials accountable for their role in that program, and it has failed to bring criminal charges against senior officials who supervised the program. But I think it’s a very important thing, what the Open Society Justice Initiative has done here, and I think that it will create pressure not just on other countries to begin to grapple with that question of accountability, but on the United States, as well.
AMY GOODMAN : Final question on this issue of targeted killings: Is this President Obama’s answer to attempting to close Guantánamo? You don’t need prisons if you kill people before they go to prison.
JAMEEL JAFFER : I hope not. You know, without more information about who it is that the administration is killing and on what basis, it’s difficult to make—to draw a conclusion on that question. But I think when you see the kinds of authority that the government is claiming in briefing papers like this, it certainly raises the question about to what extent this program, the drone program, is in fact a substitute for detention.
AMY GOODMAN : And as you said, don’t they say—don’t the documents say that they will kill someone if it puts U.S. personnel at risk?
JAMEEL JAFFER : That’s right. I mean, I think that one of the—you know, one of the really troubling things about the document is the way that it defines this phrase, “Capture is infeasible,” because once you see that phrase in the first paragraph, “Capture is infeasible,” it sounds like a real restriction on the government’s authority to use lethal force. But halfway through the memo, they redefine the phrase, “Capture is infeasible,” to mean something more like: “Capture is inconvenient.” And once you redefine the phrase in that way, then you’ve opened up the possibility of the use of lethal force much more broadly. And again, it does raise the question of whether they are using the use of lethal force as a substitute for detention, and even if they’re not, whether that possibility is open for another administration in the future.
AMY GOODMAN : Jameel Jaffer, I want to thank you for being with us, deputy legal director of the ACLU , director of the ACLU’s Center for Democracy. Coming up later in the broadcast, we’ll speak with Dan Ellsberg, famous whistleblower for the Pentagon Papers. We’ll also speak with Jacob Appelbaum, who just lost a case.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman with Nermeen Shaikh.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : An alarming new report by a panel of leading scientists warns that human activity is causing the disappearance and deterioration of wildlife at a rate that could represent an existential threat to humanity within our lifetimes. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services released its conclusions earlier this week and found that one million species could go extinct in the foreseeable future unless current trends are reversed. The study estimates the global extinction rate is “already at least tens to hundreds of times higher than it averaged over the past 10 million years.”
It is the largest and most comprehensive global study of biodiversity ever. It took three years to complete and is based on 15,000 scientific papers. The landmark report singled out industrial farming and fishing as major drivers of the crisis and called for transformative change to arrest present trends of biodiversity loss and species extinction. The report will be released in full later this year. This is chair of the U.N. panel, Sir Robert Watson.
SIR ROBERT WATSON : We’re losing species at a historical rate. Potentially 500,000 to a million species are threatened with loss. We have lost much of our native forests, much of our native wetlands. And effectively, biodiversity needs to be considered as an equally important issue as climate change. It is not just an environmental issue; it is an economic issue, a development issue, a security issue, a social, moral and ethical issue.
AMY GOODMAN : To talk more about the report, we’re joined by two guests. In Minneapolis, Kate Brauman is with us, one of the coordinating lead authors of the U.N. science report, environmental scientist at University of Minnesota. And here in New York, Ashley Dawson is joining us, professor of post-colonial studies at City University of New York Graduate Center and College of Staten Island. His books include Extinction: A Radical History . We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Kate Brauman, you’re one of the lead authors on this report. A million species going extinct? Explain.
KATE BRAUMAN : It is really shocking. What we have done is that a bunch of experts have looked at really what the trends look like for many, many different species, including insects. And looking at those trends, it is quite clear that up to a million species, 25% of all of the animals on earth, are threatened with extinction, many within the next couple of decades, unless we change our activities.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : What most surprised you, Kate, about this report as you were working on the research?
KATE BRAUMAN : The thing to me that is the most shocking is really just what the picture looks like when we bring it all together. So this report is an assessment. It is designed to bring together the incredibly large existing body of research. This was not designed to do new research. And so much of this has been known. What we have done is really bring together all the pieces and lay them out clearly so that we can see what a big problem this is.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the threat to biodiversity, ongoing species extinction and climate change?
KATE BRAUMAN : What we see is that there are a lot of different drivers that are causing this to happen and that they all interact with each other. So probably the biggest threat to species to date has been land use change. We have made so many changes on the earth, particularly through farming, but also through roads, through timber harvest, and that has had a tremendous impact. But it interacts with climate change. And so what we see is that these interacting effects of land use change, climate, pollution, species extraction—that they all work together to really make huge threats to the environment and to us as humans.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : I want to bring Ashley Dawson into the conversation. Ashley, you have written an entire book on the radical history of extinction. Your response to this report?
ASHLEY DAWSON : Well, the report, I think, is really a landmark report. And it shows that the crisis we face isn’t just one of climate change. In some ways it is comparable to the IPCC report from last October which really sounded a really important alarm about the system that we face and its potential collapse. But what this shows is it’s a crisis of multiple different dimensions and that it’s driven by an economic system which is fundamentally destroying the terrestrial systems that we all depend on.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : I’d like to turn to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s recent comments on the Arctic. Just hours after the release of the U.N. report, Pompeo celebrated the shrinking levels of sea ice in the region, saying it opened up new opportunities for trade. He also called for the exploitation of natural resources in the Arctic.
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO : The Arctic is at the forefront of opportunity and abundance. It houses 13 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil, 30 percent of its undiscovered gas and an abundance of uranium, rare earth minerals, gold, diamonds and millions of square miles of untapped resources. Fisheries galore […] Steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passageways and new opportunities for trade […] Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st century Suez and Panama Canals.”
NERMEEN SHAIKH : So scientists warn that melting sea ice in the Arctic due to climate change will have catastrophic effects on coastal cities, biodiversity and the global economy. President Trump of course has called climate change a Chinese hoax. So Ashley, your response to what Pompeo said just hours after this U.N. report was released?
ASHLEY DAWSON : I think it typifies the kind of extractivist attitude, which as I said, is destroying the planet. To give one concrete instance, we have been exploiting land so much and degrading land that we only have about 60 harvests left. Right? Sixty agricultural harvests left.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : What does that mean?
ASHLEY DAWSON : It means about only 60 more years of food, potentially. So we’re not only talking about a kind of crash of biodiversity and potential extinction for a lot of species out there; we’re talking about a kind of fundamental crisis of humanity, its relationship to the natural world and our relations to one another.
AMY GOODMAN : And he’s saying, if the ice melts, it opens up possibilities for trade. It means you can get another Panama or Suez Canal.
ASHLEY DAWSON : Yeah, it gives new meaning to Naomi Klein’s term “disaster capitalism.” Right? I mean, this is really about yoking the planet as we push it towards unsustainability.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to get your response to this as well, Kate Brauman. That if the sea ice melts, just opens up opportunities for trade.
KATE BRAUMAN : Well, I will say that I see it as an opportunity, but as an opportunity for doing things better. One of the things we talk about a lot in this report is that we are not hopeless. That there are a lot of potential ways that we can have a better future. And one of those is really having better intergovernmental cooperation. The Arctic is a place where intergovernmental cooperation has happened in the past. And we have the opportunity to really manage and steward these resources in a positive way that can be a model for the way we think about the planet. Part of that is going to be really integrating what we know from indigenous and local cultures, many of whom have lived in these regions for a long time, into the way that we do management.
AMY GOODMAN : Ashley Dawson, you talk about radical conservation. What does that look like? And you particularly talk about cities. I am intrigued by the title of your book–_Extreme Cities: The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change_.
ASHLEY DAWSON : Right. So right now, we have a system of agribusiness that’s based on using fossil fuels for pesticides, fertilizers, and exploiting the land as much as possible. And we clearly need to shift. And one of the things that’s really wonderful about this report is that it explicitly talks about shifting that system to one that is based on agro-ecology. Using natural inputs. Not using all of these pesticides that are destroying pollinators like bee populations and other insects.
And we don’t just need to think about that happening outside cities, right? Now the majority of humanity lives in cities. And so cities can also be a place for rewilding, for increasing some of the wetlands, for instance, that we have plowed under, and by doing that, for absorbing more carbon. So I agree with Kate about how this report is sounding an alarm but it’s also calling for really important shifts in attitude and material changes that can put us on a different course.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : What does that say, Ashley, about the kind of structural transformations that would be required minimally for the economic system that governs at this point large parts of the planet, which is based on endless expansion and consumption by larger and larger numbers of people at greater levels?
ASHLEY DAWSON : I think it’s the greater levels that’s really key. The report does talk about the issue of population increase, but it also makes it quite clear that it’s inequality and a kind of capitalist system that’s based on constantly ramping up consumption of natural resources that is at fault, and that we need to shift away from that system.
AMY GOODMAN : What is the alternative?
ASHLEY DAWSON : The alternative is a kind of Green New Deal for the planet, and the authors of the system talk about that. They say quite explicitly that we need a value shift and a material shift towards more sustainable forms of engagement with the planet.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Kate, this report comes on the heels of several other climate reports, biodiversity reports. What is it that this report says that these other reports have not concluded?
KATE BRAUMAN : This report does a couple of different things. It brings together a wider body of evidence and really makes a point of elevating what we know from indigenous and local cultures. It makes a really explicit tie from human activities to biodiversity to human well-being. And then it points us in positive directions for the future. I think Ashley really summed this up right—we are identifying the need to really have transformational change, to redefine what it means to live well in a way that reduces our consumption and changes our production.
AMY GOODMAN : Let me ask you, Ashley Dawson, about the anthropocentric nature of the report as it frames species’ survival as a matter of human survival, perhaps concerned that humans won’t care that a million species will go extinct unless it is put in terms of human beings going extinct.
ASHLEY DAWSON : Right, right. Well, there is something about the report that is influenced by the times we live in. It is called a report not just on biodiversity, but ecosystem services. And so that kind of neoliberal calculus is very evident from the report’s title itself. But I think that the report is sounding these alarm bells and not discounting the innate validity and importance of the natural world and of other life forms. It just wants to emphasize how intertwined we all are at this point and how we can’t break that link.
AMY GOODMAN : Kate Brauman, if you would like to respond to that?
KATE BRAUMAN : I agree; it is an anthropocentric take. And that I think is very important. Because as Ashley says, we are not separate or unlinked from the environment. Stewarding the environment, whether we’re doing it for personal gain or because we care, is what we as humans are doing. And that brings us to the center in ways that I think are very important in terms of moving forward and changing our behavior and changing this trajectory.
AMY GOODMAN : And do you see policymakers responding?
KATE BRAUMAN : I think so. One of the things that is so exciting about this is that it is a report of the governments. There are 132 member states who were part of his platform, and they approved this document. This is something that governments say “we think is important.”
AMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you both for being with us. Of course, we’re going to link to the report. Kate Brauman is one of the coordinating lead authors of the new U.N. report on extinction.

This means if you give $25 today, Democracy Now! will get $50 to support our daily news hour. Please do your part. It takes just a couple of minutes to make sure that Democracy Now! is there for you and everybody else. Thank you so much! -Amy Goodman Hi there,
