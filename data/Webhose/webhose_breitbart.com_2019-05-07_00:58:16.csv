Education Committee chair and senior Brexiteer Robert Halfon has said that “It feels like the Commons is having a collective breakdown — a cross between Lord of the Flies and One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest.”
In comments reported by London’s Evening Standard , the Tory MP went on to say, “People are behaving in ways that were unimaginable even just a year ago, whether they be Remainers, Leavers or in-betweens. The Brexit madness has affected us all”.
Mr Halfon is not the only Member of Parliament to express such concerns, with one female MP telling The Sun that parliament had become a “boiling pot of mental ill health”.
One male MP was reportedly reduced to tears after finding out he won’t be able to go home to see his children next week, due to the cancellation of MP’s Easter recess.
Comments made to a BBC radio programme by Members of Parliament claim Brexit was leading to politicians drinking more and avoiding people. One said it was “taking an emotional toil”.
House of Commons Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle has told all MPs in an email on Thursday that “Members of Parliament, Parliamentary staff and House employees are all human and it is vital that in times of heightened stress in the workplace we can access the necessary health and well-being support.”
He added, “Members of Parliament and staff are resilient but Brexit has meant we are all working very long hours for extended periods of time whilst facing extraordinary pressure.”
Mr Hoyle reminded MPs of services available to aid with mental health issues and stress including a confidential 24-hour helpline.

MPs are not the only ones apparently suffering stress and mental health issues due to the ongoing Brexit debacle, with civil servants reportedly offered Cognitive Behavioural counselling.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has reportedly spent £40,000 on the service for staff members in Bristol, York and London. A spokesman said, “The health, safety and wellbeing of our staff is always a priority for Defra and we have a range of services on offer to support staff’s mental health.
“This short-term contract expired at the end of January and bolstered our own wellbeing services for two months while we made changes to our existing employee support.”
Meanwhile, a ‘Britain Thinks’ poll has found that 64 percent of the public have claimed that the ongoing Brexit situation is damaging their mental health. The survey of more than 2,000 people said that the words most commonly associated with the Brexit process were now “broken” and “chaos”, reports The Guardian .
These revelations come as Theresa May seeks another extension to the United Kingdom’s departure date from the EU, hoping to extend Brexit until June 30th, which would mean contesting European Parliament elections , due in May.
In further bad news for already fragile Members of Parliament, EU Council President Donald Tusk has called for an even longer “flexible extension” of up to a year, saying, “We could give the UK a year-long extension, automatically terminated once the Withdrawal Agreement has been accepted and ratified by the House of Commons.”

Iran's Khamenei Tells Iraq: Eject U.S. Troops 'as Soon as Possible',www.breitbart.com,breitbart.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2019/04/07/irans-khamenei-tells-iraq-eject-u-s-troops-as-soon-as-possible/," Iran’s Khamenei Tells Iraq: Eject U.S. Troops ‘as Soon as Possible’ BEHROUZ MEHRI/AFP/Getty SIMON KENT 7 Apr 2019 Iran’s leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged Iraq on Saturday to demand U.S. troops leave its soil “as soon as possible.” The call came after a visit by Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi intended to enhance Tehran’s influence with its neighboring Arab country. The website of the Iranian supreme leader Quote: s him as telling Abdul-Mahdi that Iraq’s government should take measures to remove American forces quickly. He says the longer the U.S. forces are there, the more difficult it will be to remove them:
You must make sure that the Americans withdraw their troops from Iraq as soon as possible because expelling them has become difficult whenever they have had a long military presence in a country.
The Iraqi government, parliament and current political activists in the country are undesirable for the Americans … and they are plotting to remove them from Iraqi politics.
Some 5,200 troops are stationed in Iraq as part of a security agreement with the Iraqi government to advise, assist and support the country’s troops in the fight against Islamic State influence.
Tehran sees the U.S. military presence at its doorstep in Iraq as a threat — one that could also undermine Iran’s sway over Baghdad.
During Abdul Mahdi’s visit, President Rouhani called for Iran and Iraq to expand their gas and electricity dealings and boost bilateral trade to $20 billion.
“The plans to export electricity and gas and hopefully oil continue and we are ready to expand these contacts not only for the two countries but also for other countries in the region,” Rouhani said in remarks carried by state TV.
Rouhani also hailed Iran and Iraq’s shared stance on regional issues including Israel.
“We hold common viewpoints on Al-Quds [Jerusalem] being the permanent capital of Palestine, Golan being an inseparable part of Syria and that the war in Yemen should finish soon and that the solution to the Yemeni crisis should be a political one,” he said.
The leader added that the two countries “agreed upon the necessity of peace and stability in the entire region”.
Washington has previously criticized the Iraqi government for refusing to comply with a second round of U.S. economic sanctions targeting Iran’s crucial energy, shipping and banking sectors, as Breitbart News reported .
Iraq has also drawn rebukes for tolerating the existence of pro-Iraq militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) which are helping are helping Iran expand its activities inside the country.

Judge Edmondo Barelli Innocenti, who is the president of the Court of Appeal in Turin, publicly apologised to Leo’s family, saying, “As a representative of the state I would like to apologise to the family of Stefano Leo,” but added, “I do not agree to say that the Court of Appeal is jointly responsible for the murder. We did what we had to do,” Il Giornale reports .
This “apology” comes after it was revealed that the Italian-Moroccan had been sentenced in June of 2016 to a year and six months in prison for aggravated assault on an ex-girlfriend.
At the time, another judge had denied him a suspended sentence in the case, referring to past crimes he had also committed. Despite this, the Court of Appeal later ruled that Said would not have to go to prison and serve his sentence and he was allowed to remain free.
“There was a problem. I can apologise, but there is no certainty that Mechaquat Said could still be imprisoned on February 23rd,” the judge added.
Migrant Admits to Killing Italian Man Because He Was ‘White, Happy’ https://t.co/KuwarjdRvz
 April 3, 2019
The Italian Ministry of Justice has launched a formal investigation into the matter to determine whether or not a judicial error was made in the case.
Said made headlines earlier this week after he turned himself in to police and admitted to stabbing Leo in the throat on the banks of the river Po, saying that he targetted him because he looked happy and he wanted to target a white Italian.
The killing is the latest to make headlines in Italy and follows the gruesome murder of Italian teen Pamela Mastropietro, who was allegedly murdered by a Nigerian drug dealer last year.
The trial of suspect Innocent Oseghale began earlier this year and horrific testimony from a man detained in prison with him claimed that Oseghale and another accomplice had begun dismembering 18-year-old Mastropietro while she was still alive .

The United States is expected to designate the Revolutionary Guards a foreign terrorist organization, according to Reuters, marking the first time Washington has formally labeled another country’s military a terrorist group.
This has prompted an immediate response by 255 out of the 290 Iranian lawmakers, the domestic IRNA newsagency reported . They said:
We will answer any action taken against this force with a reciprocal action.
So the leaders of America, who themselves are the creators and supporters of terrorists in the (Middle East) region, will regret this inappropriate and idiotic action.
IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari warned in 2017 that if Trump went ahead with the long-anticipated move, “then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world”.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has advocated the change in U.S. policy as part of the Trump administration’s tough posture toward Tehran.
Dr. Sebastian Gorka, host of SALEM Radio’s National show AMERICA First, formerly Deputy Assistant to President Trump and Breitbart News National Security editor, appeared on Breitbart News Daily in 2017 and urged U.S. President Donald Trump to act against the IRGC.
“This is an organization that has cost the lives of scores of U.S. service men and women, that is a terrorist actor across the whole region,” Mr. Gorka charged.
If he did so, “Then he sends a very clear message that not only is this deal that we’ve inherited a disastrous deal, we are going to take the fight to the biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world today. The designation of the IRGC would send that message.”
Established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the Shi’ite clerical ruling system, the IRGC is Iran’s most powerful security organization. It has control over large sectors of the Iranian economy and has a huge influence in its political system.
