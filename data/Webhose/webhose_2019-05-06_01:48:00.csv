Buttigieg said, “It’s something that frustrates me because the hypocrisy is unbelievable. Here you have somebody that not only acts in a way that’s not consistent with anything I hear in scripture or church were it is about lifting up the least among us and taking care of strangers which is another word for immigrants, and making sure that you are focusing your efforts on the poor. Also personally how you’re supposed to conduct yourself, not chest pumping look at me-ism but humbling yourself among others. Foot washing is a central image in the New Testament. We see the diametric opposite of that in this presidency.”
He added, “I think there was a cynical process where he decided to, for example, begin to pretend to be pro-life and govern accordingly. Which was good enough to bring many evangelicals over to his side. But even on the version of Christianity that you hear from the religious right, which is about sexual ethics, I can’t believe that somebody who was caught writing hush money checks to adult-film actresses is somebody they should be lifting up as the kind of person you want to be leading this nation.”

Presidency: No Deal With Onnoghen Over Resignation,www.hopefornigeriaonline.com,Marie Sana,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.hopefornigeriaonline.com/presidency-no-deal-with-onnoghen-over-resignation/,"9th National Assembly: Lawan, Ndume, Goje Shift Battleground To PDP Camp Presidency: No Deal With Onnoghen Over Resignation Marie Sana April 7, 2019 Government and politics No Comments on Presidency: No Deal With Onnoghen Over Resignation
There is no deal between the Presidency and embattled Justice Walter Onnoghen on his exit as Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN),The Nation learnt last night.
Onnoghen who had been on suspension since January 25 following allegations of corruption against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), turned in his letter of resignation on Thursday.
Then followed speculations that he had reached an agreement with the Presidency for the purpose of giving him a soft landing after the National Judicial Commission (NJC) recommended that he should be compulsorily retired.
However, highly placed Presidency sources said yesterday that at no time was a deal reached between the seat of power and Onnoghen or his representatives on how he should leave office.
Sources said his ongoing trial for non-declaration of assets would run its course.
There was anxiety yesterday over his fate at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) which is handling the case. How To Get Your Google Adsense Approved – Webmasters
Some forces in government are said to be pushing that the trial should go on, some members of the bench and the bar are in support of the NJC decision that Onnoghen be retired.
A top source in CCT said the tribunal will go ahead with its sitting on April 15 unless there is a notice of discontinuance of the trial from the prosecutors.
The tribunal has given the Onnoghen’s lawyers up till Tuesday (April 9) to file their final address.
The prosecutors have an April 11 deadline to submit their final address.
The prosecutors were locked in a marathon session yesterday to prepare their final address.
According to the tribunal, all addresses will be adopted on April 15 by the two parties.
A top source, who spoke in confidence, said: “The fate of Onnoghen is still dicey. It is unclear whether or not the Presidency will see through the conclusion of his trial by the CCT.
“There are also some alleged infractions which were investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). We do not know if he will face trial or not on these.
“While some in government and rights groups have been calling for his trial, some members of the bench and the bar are trying to lobby the Presidency to adopt the soft-landing window provided by the NJC.
“President Buhari is awaiting the legal opinion he commissioned on NJC’s report and he might unfold his position when he returns from Jordan.”
Another highly-placed source said of Onnoghen:
*Isn’t his retirement notice or resignation an afterthought?
* Does retirement amount to acquittal of any offence?* If he wanted retirement, why did he allow this case to the extent of attracting political propaganda against the government?
* Why would NJC recommend retirement with full benefits without deterrence for Onnoghen?
* Shouldn’t the outgoing CJN forfeit suspicious funds in his accounts, especially monies outside his salaries, investment and official allowances?
*Will it not amount to double standards to slap Onnoghen on the wrist while other Nigerians go to jail for lesser offences?
* Will a political pardon for Onnoghen put an end to the Cold War between the Executive and the Judiciary?
*Won’t any pardon for the outgoing CJN mess up the anti-corruption agenda of Buhari?
The source added: “There are many salient points surrounding this Onnoghegate. The outgoing CJN said he decided to retire or resign to save the Judiciary.
“By the time the legal advice is out and digested by the President, we will know where we are going.
“Even in the Presidency, we know that Onnoghen’s retirement or resignation has made the case at hand to be interwoven.”
Sources at the CCT said: “We have not received any notice of the discontinuance of the trial of the CJN. We do not know whether or not the prosecutors will file any application next week.
“Going by our schedule, the trial continues. The CCT has directed Onnoghen’s lawyers to submit their final address on Tuesday (April 9) and the prosecutors will take their turn on April 11.
“All parties are to appear before the tribunal on April 15 for the adoption of their addresses. But if the government chooses to withdraw the charges against Onnoghen on April 15, the tribunal has no case than to strike out the matter.”
It was gathered that the federal government prosecutors met yesterday to compile their final address.
A source in the prosecuting team said: “We have not got any directive from the government that we should either stay action or discontinue the trial of Onnoghen.
“We are holding a session to wrap up our final address and meet the timeline set by the CCT.” If you enjoyed this article FEEL Free to TIP Hope for Nigeria Online: Any Amount Welcome 🙂 Paypal: Paypal.me/hopefornigeria Do you have story and would like it to be published on Hope for Nigeria ? or want to Place Adverts on the Website, If yes email us at moyo@hopefornigeriaonline.com Sign Up to Get Regular News Articles & Updates An Opportunity for Regular Information Straight to Your INBOX

Sokoto State University has increased tuition fee by over a 100 percent for the new academic session and issued a seven-day ultimatum for students to comply or withdraw from the university.
According to the Ramadan Mijinyawa, President, National Union of Zamfara State Students (NUZAMSS), the fee increase was unexpected and many students, particularly students from Zamfara State, cannot afford it.
He said the school management added an additional N60,000 to the old tuition fee, which was about N40,000 to N50,000, depending on the department. This brings the new tuition to 100,000 or more.
Mijinyawa said all attempts to appeal to the state government and the school management have fallen on deaf ears.
The students urged the management to reverse the new fee schedule, as majority of them are unable to meet such sudden and steep financial demand.
Amira Lawal, a 400 level student of Education Foundation, said she might lose her admission as she is unable to pay the new tuition fee.
Similarly, Mansur Galadima said he can no longer afford the tuition, and called on the Zamfara State government to intervene so that the additional N60,000 is dropped.
“I cannot afford to pay the just introduced N60,000 as tuition fee, which raised the total amount of my school fee to 94,000,” he said. “We are praying to Zamfara State government or any important political icon in the state to urgently assist us in other to save our future, because by Monday we will lose our admission if we are unable to pay.” If you enjoyed this article FEEL Free to TIP Hope for Nigeria Online: Any Amount Welcome 🙂 Paypal: Paypal.me/hopefornigeria Do you have story and would like it to be published on Hope for Nigeria ? or want to Place Adverts on the Website, If yes email us at moyo@hopefornigeriaonline.com Sign Up to Get Regular News Articles & Updates An Opportunity for Regular Information Straight to Your INBOX

"9th National Assembly: Lawan, Ndume, Goje Shift Battleground To PDP Camp",www.hopefornigeriaonline.com,Marie Sana,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.hopefornigeriaonline.com/9th-national-assembly-lawan-ndume-goje-shift-battleground-to-pdp-camp/,"9th National Assembly: Lawan, Ndume, Goje Shift Battleground To PDP Camp 9th National Assembly: Lawan, Ndume, Goje Shift Battleground To PDP Camp Marie Sana April 7, 2019 Government and politics No Comments on 9th National Assembly: Lawan, Ndume, Goje Shift Battleground To PDP Camp
As the battle for the leadership of the Senate intensifies ahead of the inauguration of the 9th National Assembly in June, the camps of the senators-elect seeking to take over the leadership of the Red Chamber have shifted their attention to opposition members.
Already, the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) has settled for one of the aspirants and current Senate Leader Ahmad Lawan (APC, Yobe) as its choice for the Senate top job. However, Senator Ali Ndume (APC,Borno), himself a former Senate leader, has vowed to go against his party and contest the position. Another senator said to be eyeing the position is Danjuma Goje who is said to be working from behind the scenes to achieve his ambition.
Akelicious gathered that with the party, APC, already in favour of Senator Lawan, the contenders are looking outside for support.
Among the camps, it was gathered that Team Lawan, Team Ndume and Team Goje are actively wooing senators-elect from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and some state governors are now being contacted to lobby their home senators to support specific candidates.
Akelicious reports that while the governing APC has majority in the 9th Assembly with 65 senators-elect, the PDP has about 41 in its fold, while Young Peoples Party has only Ifeanyi Uba for the moment, as the first-time senator-elect is perceived to be flirting with the party in power.
Of the 65 APC senators-elect, the South West have 14, South East, 2, North-West, 20, South-South, 3, North-East, 14 and North-Central,12. Accord Party Rejects Rivers Guber Results
Since the election for the leadership of the National Assembly would be conducted at the chambers, it was gathered that almost all the camps seeking to take over the leadership positions have now focused their attention on the opposition PDP.
Akelicious gathered that most of the camps are banking on the fact that if they can get block votes from the main opposition political party, it would be much easier to win the in-house contest.
APC has zoned the office of the Senate President to the North East while the office of the deputy Senate president was also zoned to the South-South with Ovie Omo-Agege (APC, Delta Central), fully in the race.
While the alignments and realignments is taking shape, a strategist for the APC in the 2019 general elections, who is also knowledgeable about National Assembly politics, has faulted the party chairman, Adams Oshiohmole, for exposing the party’s game plan much earlier.
The strategist, who prefers to remain anonymous, said there are different camps now realigning which could be detrimental to the party’s wish to take control of the leadership of the party.
“You know, for now things are not going smoothly. A lot of snags created by the party could be detrimental,” the strategist said, adding that what happened in 2015 could repeat itself in 2019.
Speaking to Akelicious, a chieftain of the APC and former minister of sport, Bala Ka’oje, said he had advised the party to zone the principal offices as early as possible but the party leadership ignored the advice.
“I advised that we should zone National Assembly positions as quickly as possible. If you zone positions, everyone knows what is coming to him. If you zoned the office of the Senate president to the North-eastern states for example, there is nothing wrong in nominating three people and forwarding their names to the zone for them to select one person,” Ka’oje said, adding that presenting one candidate in a zone with 14 senators-elect could be detrimental.
“All we heard was that the chairman of the party nominated the president of the Senate and the speaker of the House,” Ka’oje said.
According to him, when it comes to National Assembly politics, things are not done like that.
“When we were in the other party, we contributed money to assist contestants. Did he do that? Here he is telling them they most obey him. Obedience is reciprocal. You can’t appoint people to lead the Senate and the House. It’s a problem in the APC and that problem will continue to happen because the party is not doing the right thing.
“Oshiohmole is only interested on his interest. See what we faced in Rivers, Zamfara, Cross River and the rest of the states? He keeps making too many errors that are bad for the party,” Ka’oje added.
He remarked that the party’s problems are due to lack of consultation.
“The party chairman is claiming he knows everything. No one wants to consult people like us. Yes, we won election but it was a fierce contest. The PDP took some states belonging to us. I’ve been to the APC chairman’s house more than five times. I left my card but he never looked for me. They don’t care about the advice we offer even in the newspaper and that could be detrimental in the National Assembly elections,” Ka’oje added.
Weighing in on the Senate leadership race, the pioneer APC national vice chairman in charge of North East, Dr Umar Duhu, said that both Ndume and Lawan are from the same bloc of the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) and that both are qualified to occupy the seat of the chairman of the National Assembly.
Duhu, who expressed displeasure at the way the party leadership is treating some of its members, said there is no way the party can control its members when it did not play a major part in ensuring their election.
“You do not also expect that an elected senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria , who paid through his nose to be candidate of the party and spent heavily to get elected, could easily obey a party whose leadership talks from both sides of their mouths. I do not see any directive handed over to the elected legislators working; rather, the party must go begging and apologising to Nigerians for most of their lapses to get the party working again.
“Unless the APC, as a party, purges itself of disloyal and self seeking members that shamelessly worked against the interest of APC at all levels during the 2019 general election, no right thinking Nigerian will take the directives of the leadership seriously. I will not also be surprised when a repeat of the 8th assembly comes to the fore,” Duhu added.
Speaking on the contestants suitability for the job, he said: “Both Senators Ahmed Lawan and Ali Ndume are of the same Constituency, the defunct ANPP, while Sen Danjuma Goje is from a different bloc. In terms of qualifications, all of them are qualified to take the 9th Senate to the next level.” If you enjoyed this article FEEL Free to TIP Hope for Nigeria Online: Any Amount Welcome 🙂 Paypal: Paypal.me/hopefornigeria Do you have story and would like it to be published on Hope for Nigeria ? or want to Place Adverts on the Website, If yes email us at moyo@hopefornigeriaonline.com Sign Up to Get Regular News Articles & Updates An Opportunity for Regular Information Straight to Your INBOX

Accord Party Rejects Rivers Guber Results,www.hopefornigeriaonline.com,Marie Sana,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.hopefornigeriaonline.com/accord-party-rejects-rivers-guber-results/,"Marie Sana April 7, 2019 Government and politics No Comments on Accord Party Rejects Rivers Guber Results
The Accord Party in Rivers State has said it will not accept the results of the March 9, 2019 governorship election as declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
The party described the results of the governorship election, which saw the reelection of Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, as the product of militarised election processes, armed thuggery, compromised election umpire and a massively disenfranchised electorate.
Chairman of Accord Party in the state, Nnanna Onyekwere, in a statement issued in Port Harcourt, alleged that highly placed politicians in the state displayed crass impunity, through the imposition of candidates and the primitive orchestration of crisis in opponents’ camps- acts known to INEC and tacitly encouraged by the election umpire.
The statement reads in part: “The Rivers State chapter of Accord therefore rejects in its entirety, the Rivers State governorship result announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on April 3, 2019 and also rejects the national and state assembly results as announced due to the following reasons:
“That whereas Accord, in Rivers State, duly conducted its governorship primaries through an election panel mandated by its National Working Committee on October 4, 2018, in which Mr Nelson Amieye was returned by way of consensus and whereas Mr Nelson Amieye voluntarily withdrew and was lawfully and duly substituted by Chief Dumo Lulu-Briggs, corrupt officials of INEC contrived a report purporting to have supervised another primary on the same day, which produced one Precious Baridoo, knowing fully well that the national working committee of Accord did not invite INEC to such an event and venue.
“That the contrived and unauthorised primaries allegedly supervised by corrupt INEC officials, enabled Precious Baridoo and his sponsors to lay claim to the governorship ticket of Accord, thereby confusing the electorate and causing grave damage to the fortunes of the party in Rivers State.
“That the INEC fact-finding committee set up after the suspension of the March 9, 2019 governorship and house of assembly elections, neither invited Accord nor acknowledged the party’s petition to the committee.
“That despite publishing the name of Chief Dumo Lulu-Briggs on its final list as the Rivers State governorship candidate of Accord and having been duly served with the stay of execution granted by the Federal Appeal Court on March 22, 2019 against the High Court ruling that set aside the candidature of Chief Dumo Lulu-Briggs, INEC did not allow his agents into the resumed collation of result of April 2, 2019 and did not mention his name on the final result as announced on April 3, 2019.
“That Rivers people were not allowed to vote in the February 23, 2019 Presidential and National Assembly elections due to pervading violence that left the elections inconclusive in several state and national constituencies. CLICK HERE FOR REGULAR NEWS AND UPDATES
“Again on March 9, 2019, the Rivers electorate was not allowed to exercise its fundamental right to vote as was succinctly enunciated by INEC in its press statement of March 10, 2019 suspending the entire election process based on reports from its officials in the field about widespread disruption of elections and violence.
“That we are shocked that INEC proceeded with the March 9, 2019 elections by collating figures purportedly generated from an election which were, according to INEC, marred by violence in substantial polling units.
“That the improper conduct of some principal staff of INEC in Rivers State makes it extremely difficult for us to accept that the figures so collated (having been in INEC custody since March 10, 2019), actually emanated from the polling units despite the widespread violence of March 9, 2019, considering that all polling officials had since dispersed to their homes due to the alarm raised by the electoral umpire. 8th NASS Should Pass Regulations On Tobacco Control Act – NTCA
“That there were conflicting claims of collated results from INEC, the AAC and the SDP. The AAC claims that it was leading in 15 LGAs before the suspension of results but INEC had a contrary view. The SDP also published its own results on the social media.
“Unfortunately, before it suspended the entire electoral process, INEC did not deem it fit to announce the LGAs it claimed were already collated and the figures involved, thereby creating huge doubts about its credibility.” If you enjoyed this article FEEL Free to TIP Hope for Nigeria Online: Any Amount Welcome 🙂 Paypal: Paypal.me/hopefornigeria Do you have story and would like it to be published on Hope for Nigeria ? or want to Place Adverts on the Website, If yes email us at moyo@hopefornigeriaonline.com Sign Up to Get Regular News Articles & Updates An Opportunity for Regular Information Straight to Your INBOX

Nigeria Tobacco Control Alliance (NTCA) and Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN), have called on 8th National Assembly to pass the draft of the National Tobacco Control Regulation as a legacy that would regulate the production and supply of tobacco in the country.
The programme coordinator of NTCA, Oluseun Esan, led a rally to the NASS, yesterday, in Abuja, demanding the approval of regulations for National Tobacco Control Act.
According to Esan, the National Tobacco Control Act (NTCA) was a legacy left by the 7th National Assembly and signed into law in 2015, by former President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration.
“So, we are calling on the 8th National Assembly to leave a legacy of assenting to the National Tobacco Control Regulations Act.“The Act had been submitted to the National Assembly for them to do the needful,” he said.
On his part; the deputy executive director, Environmental Rights Action and Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN), Akinbode Oluwafemi, said, “We are aware that the current session of the National Assembly will end on June 6, thereby necessitating that the National Assembly needs to approve the draft regulations within weeks.” Kelechi Nwogu Mocks Rotimi Amaechi For Losing To Wike
He called on the leadership and members of the National Assembly to resist attempts by tobacco corporations and their allies to water down the provisions of the regulations and ensure its speedy passage.
He added that, Nigerians would count this as a legacy achievement of the current leadership and members of the National Assembly.

Eating Too Much Of These 9 Nigerian Foods May Kill You,www.hopefornigeriaonline.com,Marie Sana,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.hopefornigeriaonline.com/eating-too-much-nigerian-foods-may-kill-you/,"9th National Assembly: Lawan, Ndume, Goje Shift Battleground To PDP Camp Eating Too Much Of These 9 Nigerian Foods May Kill You Marie Sana April 6, 2019 Health issues No Comments on Eating Too Much Of These 9 Nigerian Foods May Kill You
Fufu is dangerous, Eba can kill you!! Doctors make shocking discoveries about some favourite Nigerian foods that can send you to early grave- Details can save your life
While food is good for the body and necessary for survival, humans are also expected to be wary of the meals they ingest and the rate at which they consume them. Some types of food, if taken excessively, are capable of causing health risks. The onus is on you to learn why certain foods are unhealthy, why you shouldn’t take them and how you can make better choices on daily basis.
Here are some unhealthy meals Doctors have warned Nigerians to be cautious about their consumption:
Egusi soup:
At the mention of this soup, many will salivate as it is much-loved by many Nigerians… but hold that saliva. Egusi contains something called phytosterols which when consumed, compete with cholesterol for absorption in the digestive system.
￼
Also, egusi has a high level of calories and when garnished with few chunks of stock fish and two pieces of meat, it has a total of roughly 700 calories per serving. Imagine consuming it with about 3 wraps of eba which is about 600 calories.
Loaf of sliced bread:
Bread is widely consumed daily across the country especially because it doesn’t have to be cooked before consumption. Bread belongs to the class of starchy foods and overt consumption increases the risk of getting diabetes.
￼
If you are taking in 100 grams of bread, you are consuming 265 calories, especially if it is white bread. Some Nigerian-made breads are also not completely bromate free. Potassium bromate is added to help strengthen the bread dough and this chemical is cancerous. If you can steer off bread, there are other excellent choices that are low in carbs.
One minute Noodles:
While noodles can’t be called a Nigerian food, it has been adopted into Nigeria ’s stream of foods such that it is consumed by both young and old. Nigerians go for noodles because it is cheap, easy and fast to cook, hence the name “instant noodles.”
Tests have revealed that noodles contain high sodium which aside being cancerous, causes heart disease and skin damage. Eating too much of noodles is bad for digestion and it also leads to obesity.
Eba:
Processed from cassava, garri is a food rich in carbohydrate; both the yellow and the white type. Garri helps to restore lost energy but a high rate of consumption does more harm than good. A cup of garri contains about 360 calories, 95% of which is carbohydrates and further consumption with soup, meat and/or fish, increases the level of calories.
￼
Consuming a great deal of starchy foods like eba is like welcoming excess weight with open arms.
Fufu, made from cassava:
Fufu is another staple food made from cassava and its origin can be traced to Ghana. Fufu is of good nutritional value as it is rich in protein, fat, carbohydrates, potassium and low in cholesterol. Some are turned off by the smell that fufu gives and/or the fact that it takes longer time to digest.
￼
Research has it that every part of cassava plant has a toxic chemical called Linamarin. This chemical, even after boiling the cassava, doesn’t change its state and this could be harmful during digestion.
Image result for FufuAlso, under-processing of fufu, which is rampant, has harmful implications on the health. This is because the cyanide content is not reduced to a non-toxic state. Women and children are susceptible to cyanide poisoning as they are usually the ones who carry out the processing of fufu.
Fried plantain:
There is a meme trending on social media about plantain which reads, “How can you say in good faith that the God who created plantain doesn’t love you?”. This is proof of the love people have for plantain. Granted, plantain is a good source of carbohydrates, vitamin B6, vitamin C and is also a natural remedy for peptic ulcer.
￼
However, plantain contains a considerable amount of carbohydrates and more calories are produced when it is fried in oil. Also, the water content decreases when fried and this might not be satiating enough.
Integrating plantain into your diet is making way for ample calorie intake. Taking 100 grams of plantain is consuming about 30 grams of carbohydrates, 15 grams of sugar and 120 calories. Other methods of cooking plantain (aside frying) should be adopted if one cannot live without plantain.
Pastries:
There’s an endless list of flour-based pastries which are baked, fried or roasted and are often taken between meals. Healthy snacking helps you maintain physical and mental energy and it also helps one have control over main meals. Snacking is however, only healthy when it is done to control appetite and meet nutritional needs. It shouldn’t become a habit because many snack foods are high in fat, calories, sugar and salt.
￼
￼
One tends to gain extra pounds through added daily calories if snacking is done out of boredom or habit. Consuming too many sugary pastries could also lead to tooth decay. Endeavour to avoid buying pastries on the street. Home-made pastries are advisable as one is sure of the type of oil used for the preparation. Oil when used over time becomes acidic but most sellers tend to keep old oil in use and keep frying with oil which is already harmful to
Rice:
Rice is rich in carbohydrates and fairly low in calories. It is a good source of energy because it is carbohydrate-dense. Consuming too much of carbohydrate-dense foods may cause one to eat little of other nutritious meals needed for a healthy life.
￼
Eating too much rice could adversely affect glucose metabolism in the body. White rice contains about 4 grams of fiber per cup and consuming it in excess would fill one up preventing intake of other foods.
White rice is also low in phytic acid because of the bran which is always removed during processing. Ample research has it that white rice increases the risk of getting diabetes. It is advisable to consume brown rice or reduce the rate of white rice consumption.
Pounded yam:
A lot of Nigerians love pounded yam and it is widely consumed across the country. Pounded yam is a source of carbohydrate and a good source of energy which contains dietary fiber that helps reduce constipation.
￼
Pounded yam is high in calories as a small slice of yam contains about 330 calories and one tin cup of pounded yam contains about 400 calories from carbohydrates alone. Pounded yam has the highest glycemic index compared to boiled yam and the process of arriving at pounded yam makes carbohydrates more available to enzymes that disintegrate the carbohydrates to glucose.
Eating pounded yam is consuming calories with no real nutrition. Diabetic patients are advised to steer off foods with high starch and embrace foods with low starch.

Media entrepreneur and social activist, Philip Thomas, who is popularly known as Comrade Phils was ordered out of the Nigerian Immigration office in Port Harcourt, Friday, for refusing to pay a bribe to renew his International passport.
In a video posted on his Facebook wall, the activist lamented the treatment meted to him by the immigration officers after he stood his ground against corruption.
According to him, he was asked to pay the sum of N28,000 if he would wait for three weeks to collect the passport or pay N35,000 to collect it in one week, against the official fee of N17,000 stipulated by the government.
The activist who is known for his popular campaign against corruption stood his ground and refused to pay more than what was stipulated by the government. His stand angered the corrupt officers who ordered him out and attempted to seize his mobile phone when they noticed he was recording the incident.
Many social media users have reacted to the video with some affirming that they paid the same inflated amount to renew their own passports.
“I’m not surprised at all, even the Nigeria embassies in the USA are confidently asking citizens to pay illegal fees to have their passports renewed. Shameful!!” wrote Iyke Chikere, a Nigerian in the Diaspora.” I renewed mine last week and have collected it, but I paid 28k, same Port Harcourt immigration. I didn’t know that 17k is the official price.
Corruption and impunity is on the increase in this country. Even their OGA at the top is aware, maybe that’s why the officers are very bold to collect the extra money on top.” wrote Chukwudike Tante, another victim of the corruption going on in the Nigerian Immigration.WIRED Nigeria ’s query to the Nigerian Immigration Service on the matter is yet to be responded to.

Joe Biden’s grabby habits as a retail politician may once have served him well — but in the #MeToo era he seems, well, out of touch. So last night’s SNL cold open spoofs the former vice president (played by a returning Jason Sueikis) — and it should be a teaching moment, except that he has so much trouble learning.
The supporting cast includes Kenan Thompson and Cecily Strong as Biden advisers, Kate McKinnon as an exasperated sensitivity trainer — whom he greets with an Eskimo kiss — and Leslie Jones as a potential voter.
Will this problem take Biden down before he even declares his candidacy? It’s too early to tell, but this opening sketch hilariously illustrates why he’s in trouble now. Share this..."

New satellite imagery of a building site for a nuclear power plant outside Riyadh has sparked consternation from the United States. The construction on an experimental reactor “is making expeditious progress” after Saudi Arabia’s plan to build it was announced, according to former director for nuclear inspections at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Robert Kelley, speaking to CNN. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had earlier expressed concern about the kingdom becoming a nuclear power. “We will not permit that to happen,” Pompeo told CBS. “We will not permit that to happen anywhere in the world. The President understands the threat of proliferation. We will never write a $150 million check to the Saudis and hand them over the capacity to threaten Israel and the United States with nuclear weapons, never.” Saudi Nuclear Program Accelerates Despite Warnings From U.S. Cheat Sheet ®"

The release on Prime Minister Narendra Modi days ahead of the start of Indian elections has now run with a court struggle pending and the censor board yet to clear its introduction.
Opposition parties have been protesting as it seeks reelection that Modi’s Hindu nationalist party would be unfairly advantaged by the release of the film. Get alerts:
The Supreme Court set a Monday hearing date to get a Congress party request demanding the release of the movie be deferred until voting concludes in mid-May. The Hindi film could not be screened as intended since the board hasn’t certified it for launch.
“This is to confirm, our film’PM Narendra Modi’ isn’t releasing on 5th April. Will update shortly,” film manufacturer Sandip Ssingh tweeted late Thursday.
Vivek Oberoi, who plays the title character, said the Congress party tried to block the release of the movie as it was fearful of Modi’s fame.
Oberoi, 42, said that the screening of the movie wouldn’t violate the code of conduct.
India’s autonomous Election Commission is expected to rule on different complaints filed by two opposition parties protesting the launch of some NaMo (Narendra Modi) tv station named after the prime minister.
The Congress party and the Aam Admi Party stated the BJP started the station and it breached the code of conduct that barred political parties from starting stations.
The station started broadcasting Modi’s election campaign along with also a set of speeches highlighting his administration’s accomplishments after the voting schedule was announced by the commission on March 10.
May 19, the voting for the elections of India will be staggered over seven days, starting and finishing. Counting will begin May 23. Latest News"
