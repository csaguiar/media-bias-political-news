European Leagues say will not allow UEFA competitions at weekends,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Reuters,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/sports/2019/04/03/european-leagues-say-will-not-allow-uefa-competitions-at-weekends/,"European Leagues say will not allow UEFA competitions at weekends By April 3, 2019 11:50 PM UEFA oversees football all over Europe. (AFP pic)
ZURICH: Europe’s domestic leagues, concerned about plans to drastically overhaul football on the continent from 2024, say they will not allow UEFA club competitions to be played at weekends.
The topic, alongside the revenue distribution model for the Champions League and Europa League, is set to dominate discussions when the European Leagues umbrella organisation holds a general assembly in Lisbon on Friday.
UEFA has recently begun discussions with the continent’s clubs over the format for European competitions from 2024.
The European Club Association (ECA) has said it wants more teams playing more games in European competition although, after meeting in Amsterdam last week, added that it was too early to give details on what was being planned.
However, the European Leagues are concerned that European soccer’s governing body UEFA could ultimately give captive places to some bigger clubs and play matches at weekends.
“We will always protect our weekends. We will not allow European club competition to be played at weekends,” European Leagues Deputy General Secretary Alberto Colombo told Reuters.
“The passion of football fans is driven by local football and by their tradition to go to the stadium with family and friends on Saturday and Sunday.”
Colombo added that under the current model the clubs earned places in UEFA club competition by finishing at the top of their respective leagues.
“If you give the big clubs guaranteed places in UEFA Club Competition and you destroy this model, it will devalue domestic football which drives the passion of fans,” he said.
European club football runs in three-year cycles with the current one ending in 2021.
The format for the 2021-24 cycle was decided last year with the addition of a new third-tier competition in addition to the Champions League and the Europa League.
However, revenue distribution for the 2021-24 cycle has not been settled and European Leagues are arguing for a greater share of the spoils to be given to the clubs who do not qualify for European competition.
It wants so-called solidarity payments to be increased from the current 7.3% to 20% in the next cycle.
In a recent statement, the Leagues said it was “imperative to increase solidarity so as to safeguard the dream of all clubs, and not just a few rich ones, to perform in a fair competitive environment.” "
Cardiff await Nantes response over Sala talks,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,AFP,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/sports/2019/04/03/cardiff-await-nantes-response-over-sala-talks/,"Cardiff await Nantes response over Sala talks By - April 3, 2019 11:41 PM Cardiff City has asked Nantes to meet with them directly to sort out their differences over the death of striker Emiliano Sala. (AFP pic)
LONDON: Premier League club Cardiff have requested a meeting with French outfit Nantes to resolve their dispute over Emiliano Sala’s transfer fee, the Welsh-based side said on Wednesday.
Cardiff also obtained from world governing body FIFA – to whom Nantes had referred the case – an extension to the Wednesday deadline for the two clubs to hand over evidence, so they could rule on it, to April 15.
Sala, 28, died along with the pilot David Ibbotson when the Piper Malibu aircraft they were travelling in came down in the English Channel on January 21, two days after Cardiff had signed the Argentinian striker for a club record £15million (US$19.7million) from Nantes.
Since the tragedy, both clubs have engaged in an unedifying war of words over the fee with a source close to Cardiff telling The Daily Telegraph last week they do not owe anything as they consider the contract to be “null and void”.
The Daily Telegraph said Sala signed a contract with Cardiff that was rejected by the Premier League and died before a revised one could be signed, adding there is a dispute about whether he had agreed to sign a new deal.
The Premier League club sounded a more conciliatory note on Wednesday issuing a statement to say they were willing to talk directly to the French side.
“Cardiff City has requested and been granted an extension to the deadline to respond to Fifa on this matter.
“Cardiff City recently wrote to FC Nantes proposing a meeting to discuss issues surrounding the Emiliano Sala tragedy and planned transfer, in line with Fifa’s request for our two clubs to come to a resolution directly.
“To date, Cardiff City has not received a response from FC Nantes.”
Nantes reportedly plan to dispute Cardiff’s case, saying the club completed the required paperwork. "
Brexit still pushing financial jobs from UK to EU,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Reuters,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2019/04/03/brexit-still-pushing-financial-jobs-from-uk-to-eu/,"Brexit still pushing financial jobs from UK to EU By - April 3, 2019 11:30 PM According to a study done by New Financial, 275 firms were moving some of their businesses out of Britain to avoid Brexit disruption. (AFP pic)
LONDON: Financial firms in Britain continue to shift business to new European Union hubs and won’t stop unless Brexit is cancelled, a think tank told British lawmakers on Wednesday.
William Wright, head of New Financial, said its study published on March 11 showed that 275 financial firms were moving some of their business, staff or assets from Britain to hubs in the EU to avoid Brexit disruption.
“Since the report was published we have found another 14 firms have set up new entities,” Wright told a House of Lords committee.
Moves out of Britain would continue under any Brexit outcome that fell short of cancelling Britain’s departure from the bloc as firms sought to end trading uncertainty, Wright said.
Andrew Pilgrim, an associate partner at consultants EY told lawmakers there was no going back for the big banks that have spent millions of euros setting up and staffing new EU hubs.
“For most people, they are beyond the point of no return,” Pilgrim said.
Britain was due to leave the EU on March 29 but departure has been delayed until at least April 12.
The prospect of Britain remaining in the EU’s customs union has increased, a step Pilgrim said would not give financial services market access to the bloc.
Brexit is also a catalyst to review business models and accelerate longstanding shifts in back office staff from Britain to cheaper locations like Poland, and to be closer to key customers, Pilgrim said.
Germany’s foreign banking association said on Wednesday that up to 5,000 new jobs in its member institutes would be created in the next 12 to 18 months due to Brexit.
The Bank of England expects about 4,000 banking and insurance jobs to have moved by Brexit Day, a fraction of the early estimates from consultants in the aftermath of Britain’s vote in 2016 to leave the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU with no deal, financial business could flow immediately from Britain to Singapore and the United States as they have access to the bloc, Pilgrim said.
Wright said there was now only scope to pause but not stop the flow of financial services business from Britain to the EU, unless Britain remained in the single market, a step the government has so far ruled out. "
Boeing software re-activated before Ethiopian crash,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Reuters,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2019/04/03/boeing-software-re-activated-before-ethiopian-crash/,"Boeing software re-activated before Ethiopian crash By - April 3, 2019 11:26 PM A Boeing 737 MAX 8 takes off during a flight test in Renton, Washington. (Reuters pic)
SEATTLE/PARIS: Boeing anti-stall software on a doomed Ethiopian Airlines jet re-engaged and pushed the jet downwards after the pilots initially turned it off due to suspect data from an airflow sensor, two people familiar with the matter said.
It was not immediately clear whether the crew chose to re-deploy the MCAS system, which was designed to push the nose of the 737 MAX down to prevent one kind of emergency but which is suspected of exacerbating a scenario linked to two crashes.
But investigators are studying the possibility that the software kicked in again without human intervention, one person with knowledge of the matter said, while a second said the software had engaged as many as four times.
A third person familiar with the initial findings of an investigation into the cause of the crash, confirmed the software had fired up again but said there was only one significant episode after the crew turned it off.
A Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment, while Ethiopian investigators were not available for comment.
Boeing’s anti-stall software is at the centre of investigations into last month’s Ethiopian Airlines crash and a Lion Air accident in Indonesia in October that together killed a total of 346 people.
People familiar with the investigation have said the anti-stall software – which automatically pushes the aircraft’s nose down to guard against a loss of lift – was activated by erroneous ‘angle of attack’ data from a single sensor.
The investigation has now turned towards how MCAS was initially disabled by pilots, in line with part of a cockpit checklist procedure, but then appeared to start working again before the jet plunged to the ground, the people said.
A directive issued after the Indonesian crash instructed pilots to use cut-out switches to disengage the system in the event of problems and then leave it switched off.
Doing so does not shut down the MCAS system completely but severs an electrical link between the software and other aircraft systems, a person familiar with the technology said.
Investigators are studying whether there are any conditions under which MCAS could re-activate itself automatically, without the pilots reversing the cut-out manoeuvre. Boeing is in the midst of upgrading the software and adding extra training.
Investigators will also look at whether the crew carried out all aspects of the procedure, including a recommendation to stabilise the plane before turning the crucial software off.
The pilots manoeuvred the plane back upwards at least two times before hitting the stabiliser cut-out switches to disable the system, the second person familiar with the matter said.
However, initial flight data indicates the aircraft was flying nose-heavy and not in a “neutral” attitude when pilots hit the stabiliser cutout switches to disable the MCAS system, the person added, making the situation harder to manage.
After the pilots turned off MCAS, the airplane over the next few minutes gained roughly 2,000 feet, but dived into the ground after the MCAS system intervened again for reasons that remain unclear pending a preliminary report expected within days.
Safety experts stress accidents are usually caused by a combination of factors and the probe is at an early stage. "
EU’s Juncker: No more short Brexit delays unless leave deal approved by deadline,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Reuters,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2019/04/03/eus-juncker-no-more-short-brexit-delays-unless-leave-deal-approved-by-deadline/,"April 3, 2019 11:20 PM Jean-Claude Juncker. (Bloomberg pic)
BRUSSELS: The European Union will not grant Britain another short delay to Brexit if UK lawmakers fail to ratify the stalled divorce agreement by April 12, the head of the bloc’s executive European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said on Wednesday.
Juncker spoke after British Prime Minister Theresa May announced on Tuesday evening that she would request a second Brexit delay beyond the current cliff-edge date of April 12.
May is seeking to agree on a deal with the main opposition Labour Party that would unlock ratification of the withdrawal agreement she negotiated with Brussels, which the British lower house of parliament has rejected three times.
“The best way forward is the ratification of the withdrawal agreement,” Juncker told the European Parliament. “The 12th of April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons.”
“If it has not done so by then, no further short extension will be possible.”
“A ‘no-deal’ at midnight on the 12th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready,” he said.
He said the bloc was ready to upgrade a proposed blueprint for new EU-UK relations after Brexit from the one already negotiated by May. Labour has said it wants a customs union in the future.
Juncker reiterated that Britain would not get a transition period after Brexit without ratifying the exit deal: “UK will be affected more than EU because there is no such thing as a ‘managed’ or ‘negotiated no-deal’ and there is no such thing as a ‘no-deal transition’.”
“I will work until the last moment to avoid a ‘no-deal’ outcome,” he added.
But he also made clear that the EU would set firm conditions for restarting talks with Britain on new trade ties should the worst-case scenario materialise.
The bloc would make such talks conditional on the UK honouring its EU financial obligations, guaranteeing citizens’ rights and agreeing on how to run the sensitive Irish border – a key reason for UK lawmakers’ rejection of May’s deal. "

KOTA KINABALU: Parti Solidariti Tanah Airku (STAR) lodged a police report today against a Facebook account holder over a posting deemed malicious against party president Jeffrey Kitingan.
STAR deputy president Jalumin Bayogoh said he saw the posting, under Negara Borneo Utara, yesterday which showed Kitingan’s face with a quote attributed to the Keningau MP.
The caption in Malay means: “Suluk illegal immigrants in Sabah must be exterminated; they will seize Sabah from Kadazandusun. Sabah belongs to Kadazandusun. If STAR rules Sabah, I will ensure Suluk will be eliminated immediately and Sabah is a Christian Catholic region, not Islam, says Jeffrey Kitingan, chairman of STAR.”
Jalumin said: “This statement is malicious and slanderous because Kitingan has never said this.
“In fact, through my observation of previous posts by the page’s administrators, they have always published slanderous statements.” STAR deputy president Jalumin Bayogoh.
In fact, Jalumin said even Deputy Home Minister Azis Jamman had become a victim of slander by the page’s administrator in the past.
Other personalities the page claimed to have quoted included former chief minister Musa Aman, Chief Minister Shafie Apdal, political analysts and other Sabah rights activists.
Jalumin said almost all of the posts uploaded by the administrators were meant to incite hatred towards the Suluk people, who were described as illegal immigrants out to claim Sabah as their own.
At the same time, the posts also implied that Sabah belongs to the Kadazandusun people and that it should be a Catholic state.
“I suspect the administrators are trying to wreak havoc among the people in Sabah.
“This page has more than 15,000 followers and many of their followers simply share the posts to other social media platforms like WhatsApp.
“I also notice that those behind the page are up to date on current political affairs.
“They just misquote people or create any damning statements and attribute these to politicians,” said Jalumin.
He said the police report was lodged as STAR is concerned about threats made on the lives of Kitingan and his family due to these fake statements by “Negara Borneo Utara”.
“I am confident police can help solve this problem and trace the owners of this page and bring them to justice,” he said.
Jalumin was accompanied by a group of STAR leaders and supporters at the police station here today. "
Singapore’s biggest online mall fights Alibaba with blockchain,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Bloomberg,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2019/04/03/singapores-biggest-online-mall-fights-alibaba-with-blockchain/,"Singapore’s biggest online mall fights Alibaba with blockchain By April 3, 2019 11:00 PM Ku Young-bae. (Bloomberg pic)
SINGAPORE: In the last decade, Ku Young-bae – a serial entrepreneur and South Korean transplant – has built Singapore’s biggest e-commerce company and fended off giant rivals like Alibaba, Amazon and Tencent.
Now he’s keen to expand beyond his home base into Southeast Asia.
To do that, and to compete with his cash-rich rivals, he’s hatched an audacious plan to unleash the efficiencies of blockchain technology on e-commerce.
In Jan, his Qoo10 (pronounced “Q-ten”) online mall started a separate marketplace called QuuBe using the distributed ledger technology best known for making bitcoin possible.
Ku says blockchain makes it cheaper to run an online marketplace which lets him remove the fees he currently charges merchants to sell products on the site.
That, he says, should attract even more sellers. Ku is also creating a payment system based on the technology that will help attract new shoppers in a region where cash still predominates.
So far, the response has been positive: Three months in, he says, more than 5,000 merchants have registered 2.3 million or so products on QuuBe.
Ku isn’t the first to try applying blockchain to e-commerce. But no company has gone all-in like Qoo10, which can’t match the billions of dollars Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings are pouring into the region.
“This is my attempt to shift the paradigm and level the playing field,” he says. “There hasn’t been any radical innovation in the e-commerce industry – with services largely resembling one another.”
Ku is virtually unknown outside Asia.
He keeps a low profile and has no social media presence. People who know Ku well describe him as a workaholic who rarely socialises.
He has built Qoo10 in his image: a low-key yet hard-charging upstart that retains a bootstrapping ethos despite being a nine-year-old company with 600 employees.
The boss’s Korean nickname is Ku daeri (“junior manager Ku”) because few details are too small for his attention.
“People don’t know him because he keeps a low profile but he’s probably the most underrated entrepreneur,” says Julian Tan, chief of digital business at Singapore Press Holdings, which backed Qoo10 in 2015.
Tan says the fact that Qoo10 has managed to remain No 1 in Singapore despite Amazon.com Inc.’s entry with Prime Now in 2017 and heavy investments from Alibaba’s Lazada and Tencent-backed Sea Ltd’s Shopee “is a testament to his product and understanding of the market.”
Ku has long been an e-commerce pioneer.
Back in 2000, when he was 34, Ku started a South Korean web store called Gmarket.
Three years later, consumers and merchants were invited to transact directly on the site – a concept that eventually came to be known as a business-to-consumer marketplace.
At the time, nine-year-old Amazon had a third-party marketplace called ZShop that let sellers hawk used merchandise; Alibaba was a business-to-business outfit just starting Taobao, an EBay-like site where consumers barter.
Today Amazon, Alibaba and Walmart Inc all have third-party marketplaces.
Early on, Ku bet people would be willing to buy clothing online without trying it on first and began selling stylish fast-fashion garments.
The non-branded clothes sold so well Gmarket was soon South Korea’s no 1 online shopping site, beating bigger rivals like Ebay Inc’s Internet Auction Co.
In 2006, Ku’s startup became the first Korean e-commerce company to list on Nasdaq.
Ku was busily building Gmarket into a pan-Asian e-commerce operator when his biggest shareholder, Interpark Corp, decided to accept an offer from EBay, which acquired Gmarket for US$1.2 billion in 2009.
Ku struck a deal with the US e-commerce company to form a joint venture and started Qoo10 in Singapore in 2010.
Qoo10 caught on quickly, enticing consumers with products previously difficult to get online – Korean cosmetics, Australian bath towels, Indonesian batik dresses.
The company offered fresh salmon cuts and chili crab long before delivery apps came along. They could also be picked up at the seller’s shop.
Wrapping the enterprise together was an efficient cross-border logistics network and a local delivery service that could get a package to a customer’s door in as little as three hours.
Qoo10’s share of Singapore’s online shopping market more than quadrupled to 38.2% from 2013 to 2018, according to Euromonitor.
The company has held onto its leading position without throwing money around. Since its inception, Qoo10 has raised a mere US$230 million from investors.
Tencent-backed Sea bled roughly the same amount every three months last year to expand Shopee. Alibaba, meanwhile, has pumped in a total of US$4 billion since acquiring control of Lazada in 2016.
Last year, Ku sold Qoo10’s Japanese business to EBay for an undisclosed sum—giving him ammunition to expand in Southeast Asia.
He’s now in the process of combining local Qoo10 sites from Malaysia to Hong Kong into a single marketplace and plans to invest heavily in the cross-border logistics unit, Qxpress, which has operations in eight countries and 11 delivery processing centres.
To add more centres, Qxpress is raising US$50 million to US$100 million in a new financing round that’s expected to close this month.
For the time being, Ku is staying out of Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest consumer market.
He says it’s too fragmented and that too many companies are chasing consumers with insufficient disposable income.
Instead, Ku plans to expand to Australia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam this year. He knows it will be increasingly difficult to compete head-to-head with Lazada and Shopee and expects blockchain will give him an edge.
The technology automates certain e-commerce transactions and processes that typically require humans.
That’s why Ku can eliminate merchant fees and make it easier for anyone to set up an online shop.
Blockchain also enhances trust among participants because they can more easily trace transactions from start to finish.
Meanwhile, the ledger offers an alternative, more secure payment method in a region where many shoppers lack access to financial services.
Buyers and sellers use tokens called Q*coins, which are stored in a digital wallet in the QuuBe app. Q*coins are pegged to the US dollar and fully convertible with no extra fees. As more of the tokens circulate, Ku says their value will appreciate – giving merchants another way to profit.
Success is hardly guaranteed.
While Walmart is moving ahead with a project to track leafy greens, many previously enthusiastic companies have pulled back, partly because it’s difficult to deploy the technology in real-life situations.
Larger, expanding companies may not see the urgent need to apply a different strategy.
But Ku is convinced blockchain will give him the necessary edge to compete and avoid getting into a cash-burning war of attrition. “I want to show that we can prevail by using technologies,” he says, “not by throwing money around.” "

Todd Phillips, who directed the hit “Hangover” movie trilogy, exclusively previewed the first trailer for his upcoming “Joker” movie to an audience attending the CinemaCon event, ahead of its official drop, Wednesday, April 3.
According to journalists present at the screening, the trailer shows Arthur – the Joker’s identity before he became known as superhero Batman’s arch-rival – in therapy. But when he is attacked in the street, the incident will change him forever.
Inspired by the “Batman: The Killing Joke” comic book by Alan Moore, Warner Bros described the movie a few months ago in a news release as “an exploration of a man disregarded by society [that] is not only a gritty character study, but also a broader cautionary tale.”
A movie poster was also unveiled, featuring Joaquin Phoenix as The Joker and bearing the message: “Put on a Happy Face.”
The movie is slated for Oct 4, 2019, release in US theatres. "

PARIS: Brazil soccer great Pele was hospitalised in Paris late on Tuesday with a strong fever but his condition is not life-threatening, RMC Sport reported.
The 78-year-old was admitted as a precaution after attending an event in the French capital with France’s World Cup-winning youngster Kylian Mbappe.
A representative for Pele in Brazil could not immediately be reached for comment.
Pele was still in hospital on Wednesday afternoon, RMC reported, though in a possible sign he was making a recovery, he said on Twitter: “I met Kylian Mbappe and his parents last night in Paris at @Hublot event. We talked goals, World Cups and watches. Great company!”
Earlier, Mbappe had written on social media: “I had the chance this evening to spend a once-in-a-lifetime moment with the living legend @Pele.”
Pele, revered by many as soccer’s greatest player ever, is alone in winning the World Cup three times, first lifting the trophy aged 17.
The Brazilian was swift to praise Mbappe after he set last year’s World Cup in Russia alight with his electric speed and goalscoring.
Mbappe became the youngest player (19) to score two goals in a World Cup game since Pele in 1958. He also became the first teenager since Pele to score in a World Cup final.
“If Kylian keeps equalling my records like this I may have to dust my boots off again,” Pele tweeted at the time.
Mbappe replied: “The King will always remain King.”
The Paris St Germain forward told Tuesday’s event he would never match the Brazil great’s scoring tally during his career. Pele claims he has scored 1,025 goals.
“Even with the goals in playgrounds, goals on the PlayStation, I could never equal (that),” the 20-year-old said at the sponsors’ event.
Mbappe and Pele had been scheduled to meet late last year but had to postpone, again because of Pele’s health, French media said. "

Questioning the definition of “territory”, the Sarawak Association for Peoples’ Aspirations (Sapa) said Sarawak and Sabah MPs must make sure the amendment is well considered and debated in Parliament.
Its president, Dominique Ng, said they must not be too happy with this “territory” status.
“Don’t think that ‘territory’ is bigger than ‘state’.
“Labuan and Kuala Lumpur are territories of the federation.
“The Federal Territories may have some seats but they do not have any autonomy and are totally controlled by the federation,” he said at a press conference here today.
Ng said the Sarawak and Sabah MPs must not vote for the amendment if it falls short of their expectations.
“We would rather reject the amendment than to allow it to crystallise our position in the federation.”
He said Sarawak MPs had not been given sufficient time to analyse and receive proper legal advice on the amendment before its first reading, expected tomorrow.
There should be a consensus among Sabahans and Sarawakians before any amendment is carried out to an article of the constitution that would affect their future, Ng added. "
Ghosn tweets press conference as authorities ‘mull fresh charge’,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,AFP,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2019/04/03/ghosn-tweets-press-conference-as-authorities-mull-fresh-charge/,"Ghosn tweets press conference as authorities ‘mull fresh charge’ By April 3, 2019 10:00 PM Carlos Ghosn (Bloomberg pic)
TOKYO: Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn took to Twitter on Wednesday vowing to tell his side of the story, as Tokyo prosecutors reportedly weighed fresh charges over suspected financial misconduct.
In the latest twist in a rollercoaster of a case, Japanese media reported authorities were probing a possible aggravated breach of trust charge related to at least US$32 million in Nissan funds transferred to a distributor in Oman.
Some of that money is believed to have been used to buy a luxury boat allegedly used by Ghosn and his family, according to a source familiar with the matter.
If Tokyo prosecutors were to proceed, it would be the fourth criminal charge against the 65-year-old former high-flying auto executive, who denies all allegations.
Ghosn already faces three charges of financial misconduct over allegations he under-reported his compensation and sought to transfer personal losses to Nissan’s books.
Tokyo district prosecutors were discussing the case with more senior colleagues before deciding whether to move ahead, Japanese media said.
Prosecutors were not able to confirm the reports immediately but were due to hold a media briefing on Thursday.
Shortly after the reports emerged, a verified Twitter account in Ghosn’s name said he would be speaking to journalists next week.
“I’m getting ready to tell the truth about what’s happening. Press conference on Thursday, April 11,” said the tweet, sent early Wednesday afternoon in English then Japanese.
A spokeswoman for the executive later confirmed the news conference in a statement to AFP.
The tweet sparked questions over his bail conditions – which was thought to include a ban on internet access – but his lead lawyer Junichiro Hironaka later insisted his client was within his rights.
Asked about his use of Twitter, Hironaka told reporters camped outside his office: “We are not doing anything that violates the terms of his bail.”
Hironaka added he was not sure exactly who wrote the tweet.
‘Flight risk’
If prosecutors were to file new charges, it would not necessarily mean Ghosn returns to the detention centre where he spent more than three months before winning bail on March 6, according to a local lawyer.
“The prosecutor can hit Ghosn with new charges without sending him back to prison. Prosecutors would need to again justify detention by saying he was a flight risk and could destroy evidence and the chances seem fairly slim,” said the lawyer, who asked to remain anonymous.
Hironaka said he was not aware of any fresh arrest warrant.
The news came after it emerged that lawyers for Renault – Nissan’s parent company that Ghosn also led – have handed over documents to prosecutors showing millions of euros in payments to the firm’s distributors in Oman.
An internal probe by Nissan, which is cooperating with prosecutors, has found Ghosn had approved over US$30 million in payments to a distributor in Oman, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to AFP.
Some of this money ended up in personal accounts, or was used for purchases and investments by Ghosn – mainly to buy a yacht and make investments via his son’s firm – according to this person.
A spokesperson for Ghosn has already rejected these allegations.
“The payments made by Renault to the distributor in Oman have not been diverted from their commercial objectives and under no circumstances has all or part of such payments benefited Carlos Ghosn or his family,” said the representative in a statement in Paris on Tuesday.
In a bolt from the blue that rocked Japan and the business world, Ghosn was arrested on November 19 after prosecutors stormed his private jet at a Tokyo airport and took him into custody.
He spent more than 100 days in detention with limited access to lawyers before being released on a bail of nearly US$9 million.
Nissan swiftly sacked him as chairman and is also expected to remove him from the board at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting slated for Monday. "

Seventy five-year-old Taslima Khatun is a bereaved mother and grandmother at the same time as she lost her daughter and granddaughter in the Sunday’s harsh thunderstorm ended leaving life in Bara and Parsa in agony and grief.
Bhaluhi, Purainiya and Bharbali of Pheta rural municipality bore the brunt of the devastating storm on the evening of last Sunday. The survivors of the freak incident have now a heap of ordeals to recount and hope for reliable helping hands.
The incident devoured Taslima’s daughter Muskima, 40, and granddaughter Gulabasa, 20. But the bereaved grandma is desperately waiting for the humanitarian assistance. “Life must be lived until death takes you away,” she said, adding that she had so far got no support and relief from anywhere.
Nurjaha Khatun, 35, a mother of three, was found carrying her three-month-old baby and looking over debris of her home (flattened by the storm) in scorching heat. She does not find any word to console her five-year-old (second) son who has been continuously asking for since the incident. Her father-in-law Kamrul Ansari, 60; spouse Hadis Ansari, 40; and nine-year-old son are undergoing treatment at the Birgunj-based National Medical college. She has no idea where to go ask for relief and how to pursue it.
Several organizations are flocking Pheta with relief packages, but the real victims have been deprived of it. Relief in the aftermath of the storm is desperately needed here. “The survivors have neither roof nor anything to eat. Shortage of reliable source of drinking water and toilets have put them at risk of epidemic of various sorts of diseases,” said Jamiat Ulmae Nepal’s general secretary Mohammed Khalid Siddique.
Families who are rendered homeless by the storm have no means at hand to address the minimum basic needs. The survivors are in distress due to an absence of the distribution of relief materials through a one-door policy. Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) State 2 president Deependra Chauhan talking to RSS after his field visit to the affected sites said the ongoing relief distribution process is inappropriate. Political leaders flocking here, further worsening the situation.
Serious problem has been seen in the distribution of relief to and rehabilitation of the windstorm victims. “The leaders accompanied by crowds of people come to the village turn by turn, announce big relief packages and set up relief distribution camps but leave without providing the relief. It appears as though they are mocking at us,” Lais Miyan of Purainiya, Pheta rural municipality-6 said.
The village is full of visitors coming to the village and announcing relief assistance but we have got no more than few packets of beaten rice in the name of relief, he added. Chief District Officer (CDO) of Bara district, Rajesh Poudel, said arrangements have been made for distributing the relief through Pheta rural municipality by preparing a list of the genuine storm-affected families as the relief distribution process became unorganized.
A strong storm on Sunday evening wreaked havoc at Pheta rural municipality, causing the most damage at ward numbers 1, 3 and 6.
Amiri Lal Prasad, the chairman of the Pheta rural municipality, said most people got killed due to falling bricks at houses not constructed as per the building code when the twister occurred and added that the new structures to be constructed would be built strictly keeping to the building code.
“I lost my mother, wife and two daughters when my house collapsed during the storm. I have lost everything. Some people have no shelter, others no family and still more people are without food and beddings,” lamented Sahabuddin Ansari of Purainiya.
Ansari had constructed his house with the money he sent back home while working in foreign land for two years.
Thirty people have been killed and more than 700 have sustained injuries until Tuesday evening in Bara and Parsa districts due to the storm, the District Police Office Bara said. Published Date: Wednesday, April 3 , 2019 05:15:12 Share:"
Barca reliance on Messi underlined in escape act at Villarreal,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Reuters,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/sports/2019/04/03/barca-reliance-on-messi-underlined-in-escape-act-at-villarreal/,"Barca reliance on Messi underlined in escape act at Villarreal By April 3, 2019 9:45 PM FC Barcelona. (AFP pic)
VILA-REAL: Barcelona’s thrilling 4-4 draw with Villarreal on Tuesday has been hailed as the game of the season in Spain but yet again it showed the La Liga leaders’ vulnerability whenever they try to give Lionel Messi a breather.
With a top-of-the-table showdown against Atletico Madrid and two Champions League quarter-final games against Manchester United coming up, Barca coach Ernesto Valverde understandably opted to rest his talisman.
Messi sat on the bench alongside Ivan Rakitic and Gerard Pique and although Barca got off to a flying start with two early goals they were pegged back by struggling Villarreal, prompting Valverde to turn to him with the score tied at 2-2.
No sooner had Messi come on and Villarreal took a shock lead before making it 4-2. But, not for the first time this season, Barca’s captain spearheaded their comeback.
The Argentine smashed a freekick in off the post at the start of stoppage time, paving the way for Luis Suarez’s last-gasp equaliser.
“Football is incredible,” hailed the front cover of Spanish newspaper Marca, while daily Mundo Deportivo said Suarez’s late strike was “a goal that is worth the league title”.
But Messi’s role in Barca’s latest escape act, which was the third time in the league this season when he has been called upon to get them out of trouble, again raised the question of whether Barca suffer from ‘Messi-dependence’.
“Of course, Messi-dependence exists, it would exist in any other team in the world,” said Barca coach Valverde.
“But when he is there we also have to play. The first 15 minutes (when Barca were 2-0 up) we didn’t need him, in the last 15 we really did. We all accept this.”
Barca midfielder Carles Alena meanwhile was in awe at his team mate’s freekick: “It was spectacular, a wonder goal, something that only he could do.”
Messi also sat on the bench against Athletic Bilbao in September but rescued a 1-1 draw by setting up a late equaliser after coming on, while he provided an assist and a goal as a substitute against Leganes to turn a 1-1 draw into a 3-1 win.
Barca’s reliance on their captain is even starker in the Copa del Rey: they were beaten 2-1 at Levante and 2-0 at Sevilla in first leg games while Messi was left at home, winning the second legs 3-0 and 6-1 respectively with him back in the team.
The Catalans’ next opponents Atletico and United will feel emboldened by Barca’s ragged display against Villarreal, knowing if they can somehow shackle Messi, they stand a chance.
But, if like so many other teams over the past decade, they are unable to tame the Argentine, they know they will be in for a torrid time. "

The Sudanese cartoonist reaching out to the world,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,AFP,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2019/04/03/the-sudanese-cartoonist-reaching-out-to-the-world/,"The Sudanese cartoonist reaching out to the world By - April 3, 2019 9:30 PM Khalid Albaih’s criticism of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has made it impossible for him to live in his homeland. (Pic from Khalid Albaih )
From his self-imposed exile in Denmark, political cartoonist Khalid Albaih sees himself as an “ambassador” for his native Sudan, with biting sketches that aim to unify rather than alienate.
His criticism of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, in power for three decades, has made it impossible for him to live in his homeland.
Albaih’s social and political commentaries – often simple drawings in block colours and with clean lines – convey scathing criticisms of authoritarianism.
But they also express solidarity and hope for a better future.
“I see my role as that of an ambassador, because I try to tell the world what’s happening in Sudan,” says Albaih, who cuts a gentle yet looming figure at 1.96 metres (six foot four inches).
“Because of my social media following I can reach more people and I can translate what’s happening,” he tells AFP.
He is perhaps most well-known internationally for his cartoon of Colin Kaepernick, the former NFL quarterback who started a 2016 kneeling protest against racial inequality and social injustice during the US national anthem played prior to games.
The cartoon features Kaepernick on one knee, his afro drawn in the shape of a large clenched fist.
American filmmaker Spike Lee wore a tee-shirt featuring the drawing, helping it to go viral.
‘Start a conversation’
With small, round glasses and a neatly trimmed beard, the 38-year-old Albaih speaks softly in an interview with AFP in the Copenhagen city library where he often works.
He left Sudan at the beginning of his teens and has not lived there since.
After spending more than 25 years living in Doha and briefly in the United States, he arrived in the Danish capital with his wife and children in October 2017.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranks Sudan 174th out of 180 countries in its World Press Freedom Index.
Sudan’s powerful National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) regularly confiscates entire print runs of newspapers that carry articles it deems inappropriate, especially those critical of authorities.
Albaih ended up in Copenhagen thanks to the International Cities of Refuge Network (ICORN), which offers shelter to artists and writers persecuted, or at risk of persecution, in their home countries.
He posts his cartoons on social media, with nearly 25,000 followers on Twitter, slightly fewer on Instagram and almost 85,000 on his Facebook page “Khartoon” – a play on the words cartoon and the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.
“I do these artworks because I want to start a conversation,” he says.
Reaching out
His aim, he adds, is to “reach the other side”.
“We are trying to reach the governments, we are trying to reach the EU, we are trying to reach the American people to tell them what’s happening.”
To attract as many viewers as possible from all walks of life, he alternates his topics, sometimes covering top world news before moving on to something more regional.
Each cartoon is accompanied by a short caption in English.
“I could do something about America and I get everybody’s attention… and then, I do something that they’ve never heard about, like the protests in Sudan,” he says.
The deadly protests began in the African country in December, in response to a government decision to cut a vital bread subsidy.
They quickly escalated into nationwide demonstrations calling on Bashir to resign in the biggest challenge to his rule.
In February, the veteran leader imposed a state of emergency to quell the demonstrations, which have since been largely confined to the capital.
Since the protests erupted, RSF says it has registered 90 arbitrary arrests of journalists and about 100 confiscations of newspaper issues.
Critical
Albaih was born into a political family – his father was a diplomat and his uncle briefly led a military transitional government in the mid-1980s.
Living in Denmark has given him food for thought about his host country, but his pen has spared it so far, despite a highly restrictive, and often controversial, immigration policy.
He wants his work, he says, to help unify by provoking a dialogue.
And he is critical of a decision in 2005 by Danish daily Jyllands-Posten to publish a series of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, saying it was a meaningless provocation.
Citing freedom of expression, the newspaper published 12 cartoons, including portrayals of the prophet wearing a bomb inside a turban and as a knife-wielding nomad flanked by shrouded women.
The depiction of prophets is strictly forbidden in Islam and the cartoons sparked deadly protests in the Muslim world.
Angry demonstrators burned Danish flags and torched diplomatic offices, while boycotts of Danish products led to a plunge in exports.
“Are they trying basically to lose one billion Muslims, telling them ‘yes, we understand that this is something you don’t approve of, but we are doing it anyway because we can’?” he says.
“For a cartoonist outside of the West, we draw cartoons for different reasons.
“Yes we provoke, yes we try to start a conversation, but we do it to build bridges,” he says. "
“Peter Strzok” – Google News: Tea party leader: Time to go after ‘Deep State’ – OneNewsNow,onenewsnow.com,mikenova,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://onenewsnow.com/politics-govt/2019/04/03/tea-party-leader-time-to-go-after-deep-state,"Tea party leader: Time to go after 'Deep State' Wednesday, April 3, 2019 | Chad Groening, Billy Davis (OneNewsNow.com)
A prominent tea party leader is joining the chorus of Americans demanding that the Justice Department investigate those who used their government power to conspire against President Donald Trump.
When news broke March 22 that Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded there was no evidence President Trump colluded with Russia to win the White House, some in politics and the media flipped the script and suggested the “Deep State” officials who colluded to bring down his presidency deserve to be investigated for their misdeeds.
Among those voicing that opinion is Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots Action .
“It should not have happened to Trump. It should not happen to any president,” she tells OneNewsNow. “It undermines our election and I think the people who did this to President Trump need to be held accountable.""
In an op-ed published at RealClearPolitics.com, Martin reminds readers that two years of leaks and lawsuits have unearthed a long list of officials at the CIA and Justice Department who conspired against Trump: James Comey, John Brennan, James Clapper, Loretta Lynch, Rod Rosenstein, Sally Yates, Andrew McCabe, and former FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.
“These are the people who, together, spun a fable about corruption and treason and international intrigue,” Martin writes, “that led to horrific damage – damage to individuals caught in the cross-hairs of the ‘investigation’ they launched, damage to their government, damage to their country.”
After the media mocked Trump for claiming he was a victim of a “Deep State” conspiracy, the public has now learned those individuals named by Martin are, in fact, the shadowy figures who were conspiring against Trump months before the 2016 election, then huddled together after Election Day to fight him both privately and publicly.
Brennan, for example, predicted just weeks ago on MSNBC that Mueller would be releasing criminal indictments alleging a “criminal conspiracy” that would include White House officials and Trump family members --- only to backtrack after Attorney General Bob Barr released his summary.
Brennan, who formerly led the CIA, blamed his prediction on “bad information” despite claiming insider knowledge of the Mueller investigation.
Writing at USA Today , former Bush administration official James S. Robbins suggests an investigation of the ""collusion delusion"" is needed.
One item to investigate, he contends, is the FISA warrant against Trump campaign aide Carter Page and whether it was based on the discredited ""Russian dossier"" that was a product of the Fusion GPS firm.
Republicans, in fact, allege Democrats used the dossier in a clever circular scheme to spy on the Trump campaign: leak to the media that the campaign was being investigated by the FBI for Russian collusion by using the very document they took to the FISA court to obtain a warrant --- but failing to tell the court the Fusion GPS dossier was tied to the Clinton campaign.
""Democrats calling for transparency should be careful what they wish for,"" Robbins warns. ""We are looking at what might be an unprecedented level of government interference in the 2016 election that makes Watergate look like a third-rate burglary.""
Martin herself is familiar with D.C.-led conspiracies, since her tea party group and many others were targeted by the Obama-led IRS in a naked attempt to stop their organizing efforts.
In a 2017 settlement with 41 groups, the IRS apologized for “heightened scrutiny and inordinate delays” after first claiming its innocence.
Martin tells OneNewsNow she is outraged that no one from the former administration has been prosecuted yet, pointing out that the Justice Department’s inspector general recommended charges against McCabe, the former No. 2 official at the FBI who allegedly lied to federal investigators about authorizing media leaks that damaged Trump.
“Why are were not seeing charges brought against him?” she asks. “It's as if there's one set of rules for the liberals, and the people who have been in power in Washington D.C. for years, and there is another set of rules for all the rest of us.”
Responding to the damaging IG investigation of McCabe last summer, Trump stated on Twitter that there was “No collusion” and it was “made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes.” Consider Supporting Us?

The government is to set up ‘Fire Control Room’ along with alert system to stop losses caused by forest fire every year.
A system is going to be developed in the room to provide information of forest fire to concerned local forest officers automatically on the basis of signal sent by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Satellite of NASA. Contact person at the Room, Sundar Sharma, said that the room would be brought into operation within a week.
The Ministry of Forest and Environment is going to establish the room at the Department of Forest and Soil Conservation with technical support of International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD).
The concerned forest officers would get the information related to forest fire soon after the pictures related to forest fire, sent continuously by NASA’s satellite at Google-Earth, are displayed in the monitor kept at the ‘Fire Control Room’.
Ninety-five per cent pictures sent by NASA are trustworthy. The Department claimed that the model going to be established for the first time in Nepal is the first model in South Asia. The task of installing the necessary technology at the Room has reached final phase. Published Date: Wednesday, April 3 , 2019 04:59:49 Share:"

It was apparently somewhere in Newfoundland. Good I found it as there was lots of news Tuesday. 1 big thing: Nationalist concerns are splintering global tech Illustration: Aïda Amer/Axios As nationalism rises around the world, globally minded tech companies are finding their businesses increasingly hemmed in by association with their home countries. The big picture: The bonds of international trade that for decades were viewed as a key driver of economic growth are instead coming to be seen as national security risks — by the U.S. as well as many of its trading partners. Driving the news: The U.S. has long raised questions about Chinese companies, especially Huawei and ZTE , over espionage risks. Objections over Huawei, in particular, have increased, with the U.S. bringing criminal charges against both the company and top executives . National security concerns have also surfaced over U.S. companies acquired by Chinese entities, such as gay dating site Grindr . Russia's Kaspersky Lab is trying to overturn a ban on federal purchases of its software in the U.S. U.S. companies can face similar concerns abroad, especially in Europe, where both security and antitrust concerns have been raised about U.S. tech companies. Between the lines: U.S. policymakers often argue that fragile laws in countries like China and Russia won't protect companies' customers, data, and intellectual property from demands made by authoritarian governments — and there's plenty of evidence and examples to support that view. Yes, but: The Snowden revelations about NSA surveillance showed how closely U.S. tech firms work with their own government. Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal showed how poorly some U.S. firms protect their users' data. That has left American companies facing an uphill battle to claim high ground in this realm. Context: Judging companies on where they're based and what motives they might have beyond commercial interests is part of a larger shift in thinking, says Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. ""We went through about a 20-year idealistic period where the ‘One Worlders’ believed everything would be this one giant global market with massive free trade and everything will be great,"" Atkinson said. ""It turns out that’s a myth. Really what we have now are competing blocs."" What they're saying : Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told Axios in a statement that Chinese companies should be viewed as agents of the state. "" In China, companies like Huawei and Hikvision willingly advance the authoritarian regime’s goals, yet here in America, we can’t even get Apple to crack open an iPhone for the FBI to investigate a terrorist attack."" — Marco Rubio In a Washington Post op-ed , Sens. John Cornyn and Tom Cotton made the case for keeping China out of 5G networks in Europe. Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, said the controversies are about more than just the location of a company's headquarters. ""I don’t think it’s that companies should be viewed based on their home countries, but rather that ... those companies’ relationships with the state and the laws that govern them are important to understand and — in the case of Kaspersky, Huawei and ZTE — have direct implications for national security."" — Laura Rosenberger"

A team of meteorologists is going to Bara and Parsa districts for studying the violent storm that wreaked havoc in the districts on Sunday, the Meteorological Forecasting Division has stated.
Meteorologist at the Division, Bibhuti Pokharel, said the team is going there to study the storm which is unusual in that it caused widespread damage in a relatively small area.
Meteorologists described the Sunday evening’s windstorm as the first ‘extreme case’ in Nepal’s context. It is said heavy damage was caused as this system developed in a small area only.
According to Pokhrel, windstorms accompanied by thunder, lightning and rain most often take place during the pre-monsoon period. He said that however the Sunday evening’s high wind that occurred all of a sudden could not be termed a storm.
The Division stated that the high wind could be described and analyzed only after carrying out study and research. Meteorologists’ team is leaving for Bara and Parsa districts today for this purpose.

WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee approved subpoenas Wednesday for special counsel Robert Mueller's full Russia report as Democrats pressure the Justice Department to release the document without redactions.
The committee voted 24-17 to give Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., permission to issue subpoenas to the Justice Department for the final report, its exhibits and any underlying evidence or materials prepared for Mueller's investigation. Nadler has not yet said if he'll send the subpoenas.
House Democrats had given Attorney General William Barr until Tuesday to produce the full report to Congress. The Justice Department ignored that deadline, with Barr telling committee chairmen in a letter last week that a redacted version of the full 300-page report would be released by mid-April, ""if not sooner.""
The vote further escalates the Democrats' battle with the Justice Department over how much of the report they will be able to see, a fight that could eventually end up in court if the two sides can't settle their differences through negotiation. Democrats have said they will not accept redactions and want to see the evidence unfiltered by Barr.
In the letter last week, Barr said he is scrubbing the report to avoid disclosing any grand jury information or classified material, in addition to portions of the report that pertain to ongoing investigations or that ""would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.""
Democrats say they want access to all of that information, even if some of it can't be disclosed to the public. Nadler said he will give Barr time to change his mind on redactions, but if they cannot reach an agreement, ""then we will have no choice"" to issue the subpoenas.
""Because we may have to go to court to obtain the complete text of the special counsel's report, and because the president may attempt to invoke executive privilege to withhold that evidence from us, it is imperative that the committee take possession of these documents, and others, without delay,"" Nadler said.
The Judiciary panel also voted Wednesday to authorize subpoenas related to five of President Donald Trump's former top advisers, including strategist Steve Bannon, communications director Hope Hicks, chief of staff Reince Priebus, White House counsel Donald McGahn and counsel Ann Donaldson. Donaldson served as McGahn's chief of staff before both left the administration.
The five were key witnesses in Mueller's probe of possible obstruction of justice and were sent document requests by the Judiciary panel last month, along with dozens of other people connected to Trump. Nadler said he is concerned about reports that documents relevant to Mueller's investigation ""were sent outside the White House,"" meaning the committee should have access to them because they may not be covered by executive privilege.
The top Republican on the Judiciary panel, Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, said at the vote that the five subpoenas are misguided because two of the individuals have already provided 3,000 documents to the committee and that the other three have indicated a willingness to cooperate.
Collins said all of the subpoenas would be overreach, and that Democrats shouldn't be asking for documents that the Justice Department can't legally disclose to the public. The committee rejected a GOP amendment that would have24-17 blocked the subpoenas from applying to grand jury information.
""This is reckless, it's irresponsible and it's disingenuous,"" Collins said.
Trump himself has largely deferred to Barr on the report's release while also saying he wouldn't mind if the full version was made public. Still, he has criticized Democrats for seeking the unredacted information. He tweeted Tuesday that ""there is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy"" Nadler or House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who has also called for the full release.
In a March 24 four-page summary of Mueller's report, Barr wrote that the special counsel did not find that Trump's campaign ""conspired or coordinated"" with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election. He also said Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the federal investigation, instead setting out ""evidence on both sides"" of the question.
Barr himself went further than Mueller in his summary letter, declaring that Mueller's evidence was insufficient to prove in court that Trump had committed obstruction of justice to hamper the probe. Never miss a story

While Trump has described these conclusions as “total exoneration,” most believe the measure of presidential conduct is not found exclusively in the criminal code. Nevertheless, if it was not exoneration, it was to some degree vindication. There was, however, one person implicated in the letter Barr sent to Congress: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Rod Jay Rosenstein Mueller's unsatisfying report and its endangering summary Mueller handed Democrats their next line of attack against Trump House panel to vote Wednesday on authorizing subpoena for Mueller report MORE .
Soon after Mueller was appointed, I wrote a column detailing what I considered a conflict of interest for both him and Rosenstein. Mueller interviewed for FBI director job left by James Comey James Brien Comey Megyn Kelly slams CNN host suggestion authorities should have stopped the 'Lock Her Up' chant at Trump rallies Comey: It's 'a very good thing' that Mueller report suggests no collusion Barr's summary gambit could backfire, al la Nunes's memo MORE and met with Trump soon after Comey was fired by Trump. That made him a possible witness to the events that he was appointed to investigation. However, the more serious conflict, and most glaring ethical anomaly of the special counsel investigation, was presented by the direct involvement of Rosenstein.
Before Mueller was appointed, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard Sessions Mueller's unsatisfying report and its endangering summary Pompeo alerted Lebanon to covert Hezbollah missile factory: report Questions mount over Mueller, Barr and obstruction MORE correctly recused himself from the Russian investigation due to his involvement in the Trump campaign. However, the investigation was then headed by not just a witness to alleged obstruction by Trump but a key witness. The first major task for Rosenstein as deputy attorney general under Trump was reviewing Comey’s record and writing a memorandum that concluded Comey’s tenure was marred by “serious mistakes.”
The memorandum cited a long list of former attorneys general, federal judges, and leading prosecutors from both parties who believed that Comey “violated his obligation to ‘preserve, protect and defend’ the traditions of the department and the FBI.” Rosenstein also found that Comey “violated long standing Justice Department policies and traditions” and “refused to admit his errors.” The review of how Comey conducted himself and the sharing of those findings with Trump made Rosenstein a key witness on alleged obstruction. That position was magnified after the White House claimed Comey was fired on the basis of the memorandum. That led to a rare public rebuke by the recently appointed deputy attorney general in which his displeasure was leaked and he reportedly confronted the White House to demand a retraction.
When Mueller was appointed, Rosenstein was a witness to events before and after Comey was fired. He was central to the alleged false statement put out by the White House on the firing. For those of us who opposed the appointment of a special counsel because of the lack of a cognizable crime in the collusion theories, those circumstances shifted the equation entirely and prompted many of us to call for the appointment. Once Mueller was appointed, Rosenstein would be one of the first witnesses who would have to be called by the special counsel. Yet Rosenstein was technically Mueller’s boss and supervisor at the Justice Department.
To make matters worse, Justice Department officials later said Rosenstein participated in meetings that not only raised the possible need to remove Trump as an incompetent president under the 25th Amendment but reportedly discussed wearing a wire to implicate Trump in crimes, a suggestion that Rosenstein said was a jest but others insisted was serious. Rosenstein is also a key player in some of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants targeting Trump campaign aides in the Russia investigation. The conclusions of the special counsel report would have direct bearing on Rosenstein’s professional standing and record.
All of that would seem a clear basis for recusal. After all, Mueller could ultimately question the judgment or conduct of Rosenstein during those critical days. Mueller had to inquire into those actions and subsequent accounts if he was to do an objective investigation. Yet Rosenstein oversaw the investigation over two years, despite being a material witness, making decisions to expand its scope and resources.
It turned out that I was not the only one raising the conflict question after Mueller was appointed. A later report indicated Rosenstein ignored demands within the Justice Department to remove himself in 2017. It details a heated argument about his apparent conflict with then Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe Andrew George McCabe Mueller handed Democrats their next line of attack against Trump Collusion delusion is over Trump formally nominates Jeffrey Rosen to replace Rosenstein at DOJ MORE , who objected to Rosenstein demanding that McCabe recuse when Rosenstein had an equally glaring conflict.
Over the course of writing numerous columns, I could arrive at only one compelling reason from an ethical standpoint for Rosenstein’s decision, which is that Mueller had made an early determination that there was not a likely basis for obstruction. This seemed possible because Trump had independent compelling grounds to fire Comey. I remain skeptical about any real basis for an obstruction charge for precisely that reason.
However, it now turns out that Mueller not only did not dismiss the obstruction allegations but was unable to reach a conclusion on possible criminal violations. He left it to others to decide. That takes us to this fateful line in the letter Barr sent to Congress: “Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the special counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.” Rosenstein was therefore one of two officials who made the final call on obstruction.
The timing also is concerning. Rosenstein was scheduled to leave the Justice Department weeks earlier but surprised many by announcing that he would stick around. Reports indicate that the Justice Department was told Mueller would not reach a conclusion of obstruction around that time. It would have been wise to avoid any role in the final report, given his personal and professional interests. Instead, he stayed in his position and, according to Barr, played a critical role in rejecting the basis for an obstruction of justice charge despite his potential conflict.
Rosenstein had opportunities to avoid making these decisions, including the final decision on the merits, and went out of his way to stay involved. He also reportedly is involved in redacting the report, including any material to protect the “reputational interests of peripheral third parties.” Of course, Rosenstein was not a “peripheral third party,” which is why he should not have appointed Mueller, overseen the investigation, defined its scope, ruled on the merits of obstruction, or now work on the redactions. To put it simply, the report implicates Rosenstein as much as it vindicates Trump. It also tarnishes the final decision on obstruction in a way that undermines both the investigation and the Justice Department.
The public report is likely to be issued in a matter of weeks. Americans have every right to review that report and gauge not just the alleged crimes but the conduct of the president before “exoneration” can be claimed. However, Trump is not the only person who may have much to answer for in the aftermath of the public special counsel report.

BANGKOK: The annual festival known as the world’s biggest water fight will be a little smaller this year, as one of Bangkok’s famed tourist districts called off its celebrations to avoid clashing with preparations to crown Thailand’s new king.
Thailand celebrates Songkran, its traditional new year, from April 13 to 15, during which revellers splash water on each other under the scorching sun.
The backpacker district of Khaosan Road in the Thai capital usually sees a free-for-all sponsored by businesses in the area that provide vats of water and high-powered water guns of every kind imaginable.
But with the coronation of King Maha Vajiralongkorn set for May 4 to 6, the sponsored Khaosan celebrations have been called off, a business group told Reuters on Wednesday.
“The authorities are preparing for the coronation and we are located right in the middle of areas involved so if we organise the usual Songkran festival it could be chaotic,” said Piyabutr Jiwaramonaikun, chairman of the Khaosan Road Business Association.
Shops there will stay open as usual but they will not provide unlimited water refills and coloured powder, as in most years, he added.
“Tourists and Thais can still conduct water fight in the area, but local businesses will not be organising anything official,” he said.
Two local officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the area had been asked not to hold Songkran festivities.
Bangkok authorities have been sprucing up the area near Khaosan Road where many rituals related to the coronation will take place, repainting roads and buildings, rebuilding pavements and reorganising electricity lines.
Preparations for the coronation, the first such event to be experienced by most Thais, will begin with the gathering of holy waters from around Thailand on Saturday, readying for three days of ceremonies in May.
The king will be crowned on May 4, with a celebration procession to follow the next day, before he meets the public and foreign dignitaries on May 6.
“There will be fewer people this year for Songkran, but the coronation is a major event for the Thai people and we all must make sacrifices,” Piyabutr said. "

The atypical superhero series about special powers and social (in)competence is returning for a second run.
Based on a successful graphic novel series by the lead singer of punky emo rock band My Chemical Romance, “The Umbrella Academy” has been greenlit for a second season.
Its ensemble cast is also coming back for more adventures in awkward family dynamics, gradual personal discovery, and superpower mastery.
Together they attempt to overcome various personal obstacles and family feuds in order to save the world from a coming apocalypse.
Season 1 featured Oscar-nominated Ellen Page as timid and apparently non-superpowered violinist Vanya, one of seven adopted siblings brought up, to one degree or another, by emotionally distant eccentric philanthropist Reginald Hargreeves and their perfect robot nanny Grace.
Page was joined by Emmy Raver-Lampman as famous actress, model, and enchantress Allison, Tom Hopper as musclebound self-appointed team leader Luther, David Castañeda as the stealthy blademaster with a bullish personality, Diego, Robert Sheehan as the almost permanently intoxicated Klaus, Aidan Gallagher as time-traveling old guy in a young body Number Five, and Justin H. Min as ghostly cthulhu-verse beast summoner Ben.
All seven are confirmed for the second season, per Variety, though there’s no word on several key Season 1 supports who may or may not have made it into the second outing.
Steve Blackman stays on as showrunner, while comic book writer Gerard Way and illustrator Gabriel Bá continue their involvement as part of the production team.
Season 2 is to begin production in May 2019, according to a Production Weekly listing.
For Season 1 of the Canadian production, filming began in January 2018, a year before broadcast availability in February 2019. "

The locals have demanded action against a construction company for negligence in constructing embankment on a section of the Karnali river here.
They have called for taking action against the Highgriva-Siddhi Shahi Prakash JV Samakhusi Kathmandu for not constructing the structure.
The Ranijamara Kulariya Irrigation Project had awarded the contract to the construction company three years back for building embankment on 1,700 meters stretch along the Karnali river.
Large area of the Satti Karnali Community Forest has been eroded and reed forest worth millions has been washed away as the contractor company failed to construct the embankment.
Not even 600 meters embankment has been constructed so far by the construction company. “Nearly 300 bighas of forest in that area could have been saved had the embankment been constructed on time. No doubt, the forest is going to be washed away but even the settlement is going to be at risk if the embankment is not completed this year,” Satti Karnali community forest users’ committee president, Dhan Singh Saud, said.
Saud said the Project has been requested to take action against construction company by blacklisting it and to complete the construction of the embankment before the start of the monsoon this year.
A local Maniram Dhungana said they would be compelled to start protest movement if their demand was not fulfilled.
Tikapur municipality-8 ward chair Dirgha Bahadur Thakulla said the locals were happy initially with the news of construction of embankment in their area.
The area has been affected from flood every year. He added that their initial happiness has now turned into sadness as the embankment has not completed. Thakulla said 994 households at the municipality’s ward number 8 and four households at ward number 9 would be affected due to flooding if the remaining works of the structure was not completed before the monsoon this year.
According to him, the bridge over the Karnali river on the Hulaki Road would also likely be damaged due to erosion. Published Date: Wednesday, April 3 , 2019 03:07:55 Share:"

PETALING JAYA: Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad has labelled Suhakam’s findings that pastor Raymond Koh and activist Amri Che Mat had been victims of “enforced disappearances” as “hearsay”.
At a press conference after a PPBM Supreme Council meeting, Mahathir said evidence must be produced. “I don’t know if they (Suhakam) have evidence to prove this is what happened. If they have, of course, we will take it up.
“But please remember this did not happen during our time. It happened under the previous government. A lot of things were hidden from us and the public,” he said when asked to comment on the issue.
On whether a special task force on the enforced disappearances will be set up, Mahathir said if there was clear evidence, then it will be set up to investigate the matter.
Mahathir said Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Mohamad Fuzi Harun will retire soon and that he will be allowed to retire first.
“Then we will have another IGP who will conduct the investigations.”
Earlier today, the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (Suhakam) held Bukit Aman’s Special Branch responsible for the disappearances.
In announcing the findings of its inquiry into Amri and Koh’s disappearances, Suhakam commissioner Mah Weng Kwai said police had refused to reclassify the cases from abduction to “enforced disappearance” despite calls for them to do so.
An MP and human rights groups have called for Fuzi to be investigated over the enforced disappearances.
Fuzi was the former Special Branch chief at the time. He will be retiring from service on May 4.
There have also been calls for former IGP Khalid Abu Bakar to be investigated.
Perlis-based activist Amri went missing in late 2016. CCTV footage showed at least 15 men and three black SUVs were involved in the abduction of Koh in broad daylight in February 2017 in Kelana Jaya here.
Sale of Equanimity
Mahathir also responded to criticism from fugitive financier Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, over the sale of the superyacht Equanimity at a “fire sale price” of US$126 million to Genting Malaysia Bhd.
“He can come here and make that allegation and I will go to court to defend my decision.”
Earlier today, Low claimed if the government had not “illegally seized” the Equanimity from Indonesia and docked it in “a hazardous environment” in Port Klang, the vessel would have maintained its value and it could have “avoided a fire sale”.
PPBM’s entry into Sabah
Mahathir also spoke on PPBM’s impending expansion into Sabah saying there were parties seeking to take advantage of the situation.
He said PPBM was going to Sabah to support the Warisan-led state government, not to topple it.
“There are parties who don’t agree with Warisan who will try to use PPBM to fight Warisan.
“We don’t need these people as members. PPBM is dedicated to supporting Warisan in Sabah.”
He added PPBM has yet to decide on who will lead the party’s chapter in Sabah but will announce it when it goes there.
Mahathir will launch PPBM in Sabah on Saturday.
On Feb 14, Mahathir had confirmed PPBM’s entry into Sabah, saying it will enhance cooperation with those who left Umno but were reluctant to join Pakatan Haparan’s ally in the state, Warisan.
Warisan president and Sabah Chief Minister Shafie Apdal had expressed concern earlier that PPBM would set up a chapter in the state.
On March 14, PPBM accepted eight former Sabah Umno leaders into the party.
They were Sabah Umno chief Hajiji Mohd Noor, Azizah Mohd Dun, Masidi Manjun, Ronald Kiandee, Abdul Rahim Bakri, Zakaria Edris, Abdul Ghani Yassin and John Ambrose.
Mahathir also said that PPBM will conduct an emergency general meeting (EGM) next month to amend the party’s constitution on how the party is managed at the branch and division levels.
The party polls will be held during its annual general meeting later this year, he added. "

(Reuters pic)
Juventus forward Moise Kean has stood by his goal celebration, saying it was the best way to answer racism, after some blamed it for the 19-year-old suffering alleged racist abuse in Tuesday’s Serie A match at Cagliari.
Meanwhile, European football’s anti-discrimination watchdog FARE described racism in football as the “Italian epidemic” and said there had been an alarming rise in incidents.
Kean, who had been jeered throughout the game, turned in Rodrigo Bentancur’s cross with five minutes left to complete a 2-0 win for runaway Serie A leaders Juve and then stood in front of the Cagliari fans behind the goal and opened his arms.
In response, Cagliari’s supporters made the noise which is described in Italy as “buu” and is regarded as a racist insult, although some fans argue it is simply to annoy opposing players regardless of race.
Kean later posted a picture of the celebration with the message: “The best way to respond to racism” while his teammate, France midfielder Blaise Matuidi, posted the same picture with the message: “Black and White. #notoracism.”
There was no official comment on Wednesday from either club.
Serie A’s disciplinary committee is likely to deal with the incidents on Friday, once the entire match day has been completed.
Immediately after the game, Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci said that Kean was partly to blame for the incidents, for not celebrating with his teammates.
Cagliari president Tommaso Giulini denied the crowd had been racist, saying he heard “mostly boos” and that the Cagliari fans would have reacted the same way if “any other player” had performed a similar celebration.
Under the heading “Italian epidemic”, FARE published a statement on Twitter which read: “Our message to Italian football on the alarming rise in racist incidents is simple. Enough is enough.”
Former Barcelona and Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure said it was unbelievable that such incidents could happen in 2019.
“The team mate… saying to the player you should not have done that. It’s a disgrace. People need to take this seriously. I was shocked when I saw it,” the Ivorian told the Equal Game conference in London.
England forward Raheem Sterling, targeted during a 5-1 Euro 2020 qualifying win in Montenegro last week, posted Bonucci’s comment on Instagram and said: “All you can do now is laugh.”
In December, Inter Milan were ordered to play two home games behind closed doors after Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly was racially insulted during a game at San Siro.
In 2017, Ghanaian player Sulley Muntari was booked and sent off after complaining about racist abuse while playing for Pescara, also at Cagliari.
Matuidi also complained that he suffered racist abuse in another game at Cagliari last season. The Sardinian club later apologised. "

CHICAGO: Chicago, known for its machine politics and corruption, woke up Wednesday to voters choosing an anti-establishment candidate who may shake up a city that made history by electing its first African-American woman for mayor.
Voters in the third-largest US city on Tuesday elected Lori Lightfoot, who has never held office, in a runoff election. She easily defeated long-time local politician and a fellow black woman, Toni Preckwinkle, 72, to become the city’s 56th mayor.
Chicago has now become the largest American city to elect a black woman as its mayor, and an openly gay woman as well.
The 56-year-old Lightfoot is also the latest in a wave of political newcomers to win major elections around the globe as voters upend the status quo, propelling anti-establishment candidates to power.
She will now take over a city where politics is a blood sport and where corruption has swirled in and around City Hall for generations.
But Chicagoans are ready for a change, Lightfoot said on the campaign trail, promising to support mayoral term limits, reforms that would ban elected officials from profiting from their governmental positions and strengthen worker compensation oversight.
“They want a break from the corrupt political machine that has held back the aspirations of so many people,” Lightfoot said during a debate last week. “They want a government that is responsive to them and that has integrity.”
The city got its reputation as a well-oiled political machine from the way Richard J. Daley, one of the last big-city “bosses,” ran the city from 1955 to 1976 with help from armies of patronage workers and crooked city council members.
Thirteen years later, his son Richard M Daley became mayor and for the next 22 years, he ran the city as the powerful political machinery churned in the background.
“It’s refreshing to see somebody who is different, hopefully,” said Andrew Tabor, 61, a consultant who has lived in Chicago his entire life.
Tabor recalled an incident from “years ago” when the so-called machine allegedly sent a message to a childhood friend’s father who had political connections.
“They blew up his car. I don’t know who he was not playing nice with, but someone blew up his car. That’s the machine right there,” Tabor said sitting in the living room of his home on the north side days before the historic vote.
Not progressive enough?
Lightfoot has held several positions in and out of government. She was an assistant United States attorney, a senior equity partner at Mayer Brown LLP and, most notably, the president of the Chicago Police Board, an independent civilian panel.
Some on the left, including Preckwinkle, criticised her as not being progressive enough, noting she made millions as a corporate lawyer representing corporate clients.
She and Preckwinckle earned spots on the runoff ballot after they garnered the most votes among 14 candidates, including Richard M Daley’s younger brother Bill, in a February election.
Lightfoot will replace Rahm Emanuel, who announced in September he was not seeking a third term as mayor.
Voters saw Lightfoot as the anti-establishment choice compared with Preckwinkle, who was a city council member, or alderman, for almost 20 years before becoming Cook County board president in 2010.
“Lightfoot will bring more change because Preckwinkle is connected to the old-boys club, the establishment,” said retired mailman Gary Muckle, 77, after voting for Lightfoot this weekend at a polling place on the city’s north side.
“We will have to see what happens now. Lightfoot is not beholden to anyone,” he said.
Lightfoot will also face a raft of thorny problems such as reforms to the police department, rampant gangs and violent crime and a spiralling budget deficit fueled by escalating pensions.
Emanuel leaves as corruption continues to seep throughout city hall.
Just this year, Alderman Ed Burke, a long-time political powerhouse in Chicago, was charged with extortion, Alderman Willie Cochran pleaded guilty to wire fraud and it was revealed Alderman Danny Solis was recently under investigation for corruption.
Burke, who has been an alderman for 50 years, won re-election in February.
In all, federal prosecutors racked up 246 public corruption convictions in the Northern Illinois District, which includes Chicago, from 2010 to 2017.
That is 80% more than in the Southern District of New York, located in Manhattan, according to a report from the Department of Political Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
“The race turned on reform of Chicago politics and moving towards a new Chicago,” said Dick Simpson, a professor in the department, who studies Chicago politics, noting that 33 city council members have gone to jail over the last four decades.
“There seems to be a desire to make reforms so that the continuing pattern of corruption … would change permanently,” said Simpson, a former city council member. "
AMC Theatres pursues Saudi expansion despite journalist’s killing,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Reuters,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2019/04/03/amc-theatres-pursues-saudi-expansion-despite-journalists-killing/,"AMC Theatres pursues Saudi expansion despite journalist’s killing By - April 3, 2019 8:00 PM AMC reconsidered its plans to open dozens of theatres, following the murder of Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate.

LAS VEGAS: Theater operator AMC Entertainment Holdings is forging ahead with its expansion in Saudi Arabia, chief executive Adam Aron told Reuters, after a journalist’s killing six months ago clouded the future of the kingdom’s newly opened cinema market.
Aron said his company reconsidered its plans to open dozens of theatres, which the company announced last spring, following the October murder of Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate.
The killing sparked an international outcry.
The CIA and some Western countries suspect Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing just over six months ago.
Saudi authorities vehemently deny he was involved.
“It certainly made us think in great depth,” Aron said in an interview this week in Las Vegas at CinemaCon, an annual convention for theatre owners.
“What we concluded at AMC is that if we continued with the opening of theatres in the Middle East, that we were doing something very good for the people of the country,” he said. “And we decided that what was in the best interest of the people was the right course of action for us.”
AMC, the biggest cinema chain in the United States and the world, is working on the theatres through a partnership with Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF).
John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theatre Owners, said on Tuesday that at least three theatre chains were moving forward with plans to add screens in Saudi Arabia. He declined to name the companies.
Fithian told reporters the killing of Khashoggi was “a tragic, awful human rights violation”, but added: “I don’t think it’s our business to make foreign policy as a trade association.”
“The idea of having the freedom to see movies in a country … can only help to open up thinking in that country,” he said. “Movies have always been a sword for freedom.”
The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request to comment.
A year ago, Saudi Arabia lifted a nearly four-decade ban on cinemas. AMC screened the first film, Walt Disney Co’s superhero hit “Black Panther”, at a movie house in Riyadh, and other companies announced plans to operate theatres in the country.
But shortly after Khashoggi’s killing, cinema chain Vue International put on hold plans to open as many as 30 locations in Saudi Arabia, Chief Executive Officer Tim Richards told The Guardian newspaper at the time.
Hollywood talent agency and media company Endeavor also returned a $400 million investment to the Saudi Arabian government to protest the killing.
Aron said his company had a “significant number” of theatres under lease in Saudi Arabia and many will open in 2019. He also expects to have “50 theatres open four to five years from now”.
The AMC theatre in Riyadh has shown dozens of films over the past year, he added.
“The theatre has been immensely popular,” he said, “as you would expect in a city of 7 million people that now has two movies theatres, in a country that likes movies and saw movies frequently, just not in theatres.” "

"Elected reps should get details of bill a week before reading, says Sarawak minister",www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Larissa Lumandan,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/04/03/elected-reps-should-get-details-of-bill-a-week-before-reading-says-sarawak-minister/,"Elected reps should get details of bill a week before reading, says Sarawak minister By - April 3, 2019 7:38 PM Sarawak Tourism, Arts, Culture, Youth and Sports Minister Abdul Karim Rahman Hamzah (centre) at a press conference after chairing the state’s tourism steering committee meeting today.
KUCHING: A Sarawak minister has criticised DAP’s Dr Kelvin Yii for claiming that it is normal for the drafted bill of Article 1(2) of the Federal Constitution to be disclosed only during the first reading.
Sarawak Tourism, Arts, Culture, Youth and Sports Minister Abdul Karim Rahman Hamzah said by right, all Parliament or state assembly members must be provided with any amended or new bill at least a week before the reading.
“This is to provide them (assemblymen and MPs) ample time to read through the contents and debate the amendment more effectively.
“Yii is a new YB (elected rep). I don’t think he is aware of this,” he said after chairing the state’s tourism steering committee meeting here
Karim said the people should remain united regardless of their political parties, be it Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) or Pakatan Harapan (PH), especially when it comes to the rights of Sarawak.
“We don’t want to simply support the bill and become like a buffalo being led by its nose,” he said, adding that past mistakes by their forefathers should be a lesson to all and must not be repeated.
“Stampin MP Chong Chieng Jen used to be a fighter. Both Yii and Chong are Sarawakians and they must have the desire to put Sarawak first,” he said.
After 55 years, there had been numerous amendments in the Federal Constitution and these have somehow eroded the rights of Sabah and Sarawak, he said.
Therefore, he believed the amendment of Article 1(2) of the Federal Constitution would be the first step towards restoring the rights of Sabah and Sarawak.
“We must thank Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad for this and I hope this will be followed by a series of adjustments to put us back on the right platform,” he said.
Earlier, Yii had claimed that it was normal for Sarawak MPs not to be given a draft of the bill intended to amend Article 1 (2) of the Federal Constitution.
“I think it is procedure that the details of the Bill will only be revealed during the first reading, which is expected to be on April 4,” he said. "
