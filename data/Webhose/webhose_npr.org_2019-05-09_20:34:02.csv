Texas Tech Medical School To End Use Of Race In Admissions,www.npr.org,Richard Gonzales,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711639323/texas-tech-medical-school-to-end-use-of-race-in-admissions,"Enlarge this image Kimberly Vardeman/Flickr Kimberly Vardeman/Flickr Texas Tech University's medical school has agreed to end its consideration of race in selecting candidates for admission, an outcome actively sought by the Trump administration.
The Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center submitted to pressure from the Education Department's Office on Civil Rights, which had conducted a 14-year probe into the use of affirmative action in admission policies at the medical school. The agreement is the first reached by the administration and a school to stop using race as an admissions factor.
The investigation was prompted by a complaint filed in 2004 by the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative think tank opposing affirmative action.
The Center's general counsel, Roger Clegg, praised the agreement.
""It shows again that the Trump administration is serious about enforcing the civil-rights laws so that they forbid discrimination against all racial and ethnic groups, and will not turn a blind eye toward politically correct racial discrimination in the way the Obama administration did,"" Clegg wrote in the National Review .
Civil rights advocates blasted the decision.
""It is disturbing that the federal government apparently coerced an agreement that goes beyond applicable constitutional restrictions to bar any consideration of race in admissions,"" said Thomas A. Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ""By going beyond the law to enshrine an extreme agenda, this agreement represents a federal government that seeks to preserve white privilege rather than to secure equal opportunity.""
The Resolution Agreement was signed in February, but it was only made public Tuesday in a report by The Wall Street Journal .
The agreement said the medical school ""will discontinue all consideration of an applicant's race and/or national origin"" in admission policies. It called for the admissions staff and other staff to be informed of the policy change by March 1. The school also agreed to revise all admissions and recruitment material reflecting the change by Sept. 1.
In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that schools can consider an applicant's race, but such policies are still subject to court scrutiny.
In a letter accompanying the agreement, the university endorsed diversity in academic medicine as ""a necessity nationally"" and maintained that its admissions process complies with the Supreme Court's ruling. Nevertheless, it said it ""is willing to sign the Resolution Agreement in an effort to resolve this matter and focus on educating future health care providers.""
The Education Department's Office on Civil Rights is also investigating whether the use of race in admissions at Harvard and Yale work to the disadvantage of Asian-American applicants. Last summer the department, under the leadership of Secretary Betsy DeVos, revoked Obama administration guidelines supporting schools who want to use race in admissions to foster diversity in their student bodies."
Trump Weighs Tougher Immigration Enforcement After Homeland Security Shake-Up : NPR,www.npr.org,President Trump,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711446892/trump-administration-mulls-tougher-immigration-policies-amid-dhs-shake-up,"Enlarge this image With a shake-up at the Department of Homeland Security, President Trump is indicating that he wants tougher immigration enforcement.

Jacquelyn Martin/AP With a dramatic shake-up at the highest levels of the Department of Homeland Security, President Trump has signaled that he wants to get even tougher on immigration.
But how much tougher can he get?
Trump has been frustrated with the inability of DHS to stop a surge of Central American migrant families and children from crossing the Southern border.
On Tuesday, Customs and Border Protection announced what it had predicted for days: The number of migrants apprehended at the border last month surpassed 103,000 — the highest level in more than a decade.
The president signaled that he plans to take the department in a new direction after he accepted the resignation of Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen and pulled the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to be director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
A senior administration official said on Tuesday that the department wasn't doing enough about the border crisis or acting with enough urgency.
I'll tell you something — once you don't have it, that's why you see many more people coming. They are coming like it's a picnic, because 'Let's go to Disneyland.'
President Trump
Now the White House is discussing new steps that could be taken to slow the flow of migrants, including bringing back a version of separating migrant families at the border. Another option on the table: ramping up deportations of immigrants already living in the U.S. illegally who have an outstanding order of removal.
Politics Kirstjen Nielsen Leaving Homeland Security Post As Border Crossings Surge National Tension And Anxiety In Border Cities After Trump Threatens Closure Speaking briefly to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said he is not looking to reinstate the controversial family separation policy he suspended last year but then implied it was an effective means of stemming unauthorized border crossings.
""I'll tell you something — once you don't have it, that's why you see many more people coming,"" Trump said. ""They are coming like it's a picnic, because 'Let's go to Disneyland.' ""
'Binary choice' proposal
White House officials say they are looking at a variation of the policy that gives parents more of a say in the process.
The so-called ""binary choice"" proposal would dramatically expand immigrant detention and give parents a choice: Their children would be separated from them and later released to live with a relative or sponsor in the U.S., or the family could stay together in detention until their day in immigration court.
Critics say the modified version of family separation is still cruel and is likely to be challenged in court.
In addition, the White House is looking at a stricter screening process for asylum-seekers that would make it tougher for them to pass the first stage of the process, the credible-fear interview.
Most migrants are able to convince an asylum officer that they have a credible fear of returning home, and they are released to live in the U.S. while their case plays out.
But Trump faces some major head winds.
While the White House has been pushing Congress to change immigration law to make it easier to detain and deport asylum-seekers, Congress doesn't appear ready to take up the immigration debate, and previous attempts under Trump have failed.
Similarly, Trump frequently returns to his wish list — a border wall, ending policies that make it easier to bring family members to the U.S. and stopping the green card lottery. But those proposals have all languished.
Moreover, many of the actions that the Trump administration has taken on its own have been blocked by the courts.
On Monday, a federal court in Northern California temporarily blocked the ""Remain in Mexico"" program, which forced some asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico while their claims were pending in U.S. immigration court.
Pushing an even tougher approach
But immigration hard-liners are ready for Trump to take an even tougher approach. Here are three possible scenarios, according to several conservative policy analysts who are influential with the administration:
— Change the rules so that migrant families can be detained indefinitely while their immigration cases are adjudicated. Build tent camps along the border to house them because there is not enough room in ICE detention facilities. Currently, there is a limit on how long children can be held in detention, and critics say DHS had been slow-walking efforts to change that.
— Flood the border zone with asylum officers, immigration judges and ICE attorneys. This would allow officials to put asylum-seekers on a so-called rocket docket. Most asylum claims are ultimately denied, so this would speed that process, which can take years given the current backlog of hundreds of thousands of cases.
— Focus on deterrence. This would include returning to a version of family separation, rebranded as a ""binary choice."" Overall, the endgame would be to convince Central American migrants that it's no longer a good idea to cross the border without authorization.
An opportunity
R.J. Hauman is government relations director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for strong immigration enforcement. Hauman says Trump has ""an opportunity to correct the sins of his administration."" He said Nielsen, whose specialty is cybersecurity, was a ""neophyte"" on immigration and didn't champion Trump's agenda.
Mark Krikorian is the director of the Center for Immigration Studies, another organization that promotes tighter immigration rules. He also advises the president on immigration policy. On NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday, he said the most pressing issue facing DHS, a sprawling department, is immigration.
""[Nielsen] came to appreciate the urgency to respond to this developing emergency on the border but much too late,"" Krikorian said. ""She had to go. We really need a new approach, a more serious and urgent approach to deal with this developing emergency.""
On Monday, outside her home in Virginia, Nielsen said that she was working to ensure a ""smooth transition"" and that she shares the president's goal of securing the border. ""I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border,"" she said.
Nielsen's last day is Wednesday."

Amazon Independent Booksellers The new novel Trust Exercise opens with teenagers attending an elite performing arts high school in the 1980s.
There, the theater kids form heartfelt friendships and relationships, and then sabotage them. Their semi-tyrannical drama teacher both inspires and manipulates them — with his ""trust exercises.""
Midway through, the book leaps forward in time and perspective. One of the students, Karen, is now an adult, re-thinking her past.
Trust Exercise is Susan Choi's fifth novel. She wanted to explore what happens when you look back on decisions that you made as an adolescent — when you felt like a grown-up, but may not have been as in control of your life as you had imagined.
Interview Highlights On the teenage mind
Book Reviews Teen Years Echo Through A Lifetime In 'Trust Exercise' Author Interviews Steamy Novel An 'Education' In Youth, Love And Mistakes It's so hard to just decode the world. And when we're teenagers, I think that we're wildly improvising. We're just sort of grabbing standards of judgment, we're grabbing values out of the air, and hoping that they fit. And we are really, really, I think, prone to make mistakes. I hate speaking for all teens, but I have to say: As a teen myself, I made loads and loads of real mistakes about the values that I held, the things that I thought were important versus dumb, the people that I thought were admirable versus silly. I really was basing my judgments on pretty limited experience. But it was so important to make those judgments. Remember? That's what it was all about. That's what growing up is all about. ... And we're supposed to! I mean again, that's what we're supposed to do ... because that's what growing up is.
On discovering the music of David Bowie
As a teen, it was very important for me to understand about music. And I remember being confronted by David Bowie . ... I remember David Bowie being this amazing conundrum, where I was like: Is this the kind of thing lots of people like? Is this a secret that I've discovered? Is this — I think I like it, I think that's OK, I think I'm brave enough to choose this as one of the things that I like. So that was what we were constantly trying to do. But with ... a very small toolbox.
On Karen's high-school experiences, in hindsight
Karen is a student who has an experience that I think could be recognized by some people who have struggled to know how to feel about a relationship they were involved in, in the past when they were young. Karen is really torn between — to put it most simply — blaming the adult in the room at the time, and blaming herself, because she felt so much like another adult in the room at that time. But now that she's really an adult, it's impossible for her not to understand that she was a child. ...
What Karen is really struggling with, that I really struggle with, is that she had an experience of agency, of choosing. ... And what do you do with that? Once you grow up, what do you do with that? And so that was something that I — I didn't want to give the reader a pat answer because I don't think there is one.
On how some women feel about other women coming forth with accusations of misbehavior later in life, in this passage:
Karen's attitude toward them is violently mixed. She might defend them to David, but in her bowels she scorns them, these young women who made a bad judgment and now want to blame someone else.
The thing that's really complicated about this — and I would never want a reader to imagine that that sentiment of Karen's is in some way a sentiment being endorsed by the book — what I wanted to express is that I think that sentiment is really real. I think it's one of the reasons that people who experience abuse or misconduct at whatever level struggle so much with figuring out how to tell the story to themselves before they even try to tell the story to others.
I think a lot has changed for young women today, and I think a lot hasn't. I think a lot is exactly the same as it was when I was a young woman. I think that there's every reason for a young woman to feel very strongly that allying herself with a powerful man, regardless of how she has to do it, might be her path forward — might sometimes be her only path forward. And forming that alliance may be a decision she makes when she is less experienced, and a decision that she is able to recognize for how compromised it was later in life, but we still have to recognize that there's this whole baked-in social and cultural structure that's pointing her toward that decision. Just identifying all the ""bad men"" and putting them into a time-out isn't really going to address the ways in which sexism is baked into our society.
On if younger generations are more cognizant of structural sexism
Oh yeah, definitely. I don't think that I would have written this book without my students. And I think the experience of teaching younger people — my students [at Yale University] are all 17-20 years old, and I've been teaching for quite a while — their way of seeing and their way of thinking is totally different. And I'm so grateful from it. ...
There are a lot of things that I take for granted that I realize: I shouldn't take them for granted. I shouldn't just go, ""Oh, well that's just the way it is."" My students will go, ""No. Uh-uh. We don't like it. We don't like this. It shouldn't be like this."" And it's like having the wool pulled from my eyes, where I've most often end[ed] up going, ""Wow, they're right. I don't know why I would've accepted that.""

Hayley Fager/WCAI Along the East Coast, spring typically means serious erosion caused by strong storms. This year, homeowners on Cape Cod, Mass., are bracing for the worst.
Laura Wing lives in a beachfront home in Sandwich. She inherited the house from her parents 40 years ago, but the beach has changed a lot since then.
""The dunes went much further out on the beach, so over all this time it's just eroded away to what it is now,"" she said.
These days the water is 50 feet from her home at high tide. It's typical to have houses right on the shore on Cape Cod, and storms can cause a lot of damage.
Wing has a costly decision to make: whether to invest $30,000 in fiber rolls, the most resilient method for slowing erosion that Massachusetts homeowners are allowed to use.
The rolls are made from coconut fiber and are buried in sandy slopes in front of homes, to absorb wave energy and hold sand in place. They are filled with sand or coconut fiber and planted with grasses and shrubs; they end up looking like dunes.

Hayley Fager/WCAI But, whatever Wing decides to do with her property could also affect erosion on nearby public beaches. According to Dave Deconto, the Director of Natural Resources for Sandwich, there is a beach in town where public and private land meet. The private homes on the beach have fiber rolls in front of them — the beach next to the rolls is pretty washed out and has lost a lot of sand. That's because any time you construct a dune, even a fiber roll dune, there's going to be more erosion where the dune ends and the beach begins.
Mother nature's gonna do what mother nature does.
Dave Deconto, Director of Natural Resources, Sandwich, Mass.
There are other options for slowing erosion. One method uses barriers to break up the wave action before it hits the coast line, but it hasn't been approved by Massachusetts environmental regulators.
Deconto says whatever homeowners decide, all of the fixes are temporary. ""Mother nature's gonna do what mother nature does,"" says Deconto. ""Every town on the coastline of Massachusetts is dealing with it, every community along the eastern seaboard, and the Gulf Coast, and the West Coast of the United states are dealing with it.""
Fiber rolls are mostly being used by private homeowners right now because the high cost can be a barrier for small coastal towns, and because most buildings on public beaches are further inland and not as vulnerable as beachfront homes.
Massachusetts officials recommend fiber rolls because they have a lower impact on natural habitats than other methods for slowing erosion. The good news is, they are biodegradable. The bad news is, that means they have to be reinstalled every 5 years.
Seth Wilkinson installs these systems and he says he's had some hard conversations with homeowners. ""And they're saying, 'I don't think I can afford to live here anymore. Repairing this bank or stabilizing this bank, will cost more than the value of my home.'""
Laura Wing says she isn't going to install fiber rolls for now. ""I can't cover that kind of expense by renting the house, so that just comes out of my savings. And I'm retired."" She says she's taking things one year at a time, and hopes she doesn't lose her home in a storm before she decides to sell."

Keith Srakocic/AP Pittsburgh's mayor signed legislation Tuesday restricting the use of assault-style weapons in the city. The city council introduced a set of bills a few weeks after a gunman entered the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in October, killing 11 members and injuring seven.
But despite the mayor's signature, Pittsburgh's fight has just begun. Supporters of the legislation faced immediate resistance from gun rights advocates who say the city doesn't have the authority to issue such a ban. The National Rifle Association quickly filed a lawsuit on behalf of some Pittsburgh residents.
BREAKING: The @NRA helped #Pittsburgh residents file a lawsuit today challenging the city's new ban on commonly owned magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. #2A https://t.co/KIbUzEdWOs
— NRA (@NRA) April 9, 2019 Pittsburgh tried to regulate assault-style rifles over 20 years ago. But the courts have rejected those laws. State judges ruled that gun laws can be regulated only in the state's capital.
Mayor Bill Peduto has said it is time for the city to do something about the city's gun laws. ""If we didn't challenge laws, women wouldn't be able to vote,"" Peduto said after the signing.
City officials originally sought an outright ban on assault-style rifles and ammunition and accessories. But the resistance was almost immediate.
In January outside Pittsburgh's city hall, hundreds of protesters chanted, ""We will not comply."" Many were strapped with the weapons that would be banned by the law. The protesters say the gun laws aren't legal.
Gun rights activist Justin Dillon, who organized that rally, says laws like this are a political stunt. ""If a politician really cared about its people,"" he said, ""they would have done something before the synagogue shooting and not waited for a tragedy to happen.""
Elected officials agree only the state can regulate firearm possession. So in March they came up with a new strategy: banning the use, not the ownership, of the guns.
City Councilman Corey O'Connor introduced the bill and its amendments.

But the new law offers a broad definition of use. It bans not just firing the gun, but even having it loaded in public. That means many of the protesters who opposed the law at the January rally would have been breaking it.
Dillon admits his gun was loaded. ""It's kind of pointless not to have a gun that's loaded,"" he said.
The NRA has filed a lawsuit sharing the same complaints as the protesters. A representative was unavailable for comment, but in a statement the group said, ""Pittsburgh residents have a right to carry the self-defense tools that best suit their needs.""
Peduto says that to have new gun laws, the city will have to go to court. ""The only way that a society progresses is by challenging what is accepted during their time,"" he said.
Not every local official supports the legislation. Three of the council's nine members voted against it. And in January, District Attorney Stephen Zappala told the city council it does not have the power to regulate guns. The city's law will go into effect in 60 days if a judge allows it to pass."

In Colombia, Vice President Mike Pence meets with the man the U.S. is backing in an effort to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Today in Bogota, Colombia, Vice President Mike Pence met with the man the U.S. hopes will replace Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. That's Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido. Pence and Guaido met after a dramatic weekend on the Venezuelan border with Colombia. Volunteers tried to bring food and medicine into the country. The military shot and killed at least four people. Two aid trucks were torched. Many people were tear-gassed.
Today Pence and Guaido called on Venezuela's military to join the opposition. They hinted at military intervention if the military refuses. Reporter John Otis is in Bogota and joins us now. Hi, John.
JOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.
SHAPIRO: This weekend's actions by Juan Guaido seem to be a big gamble, trying to get aid across the border in hopes that there would be mass defections from the military. Those defections did not materialize. So what did he and the U.S. vice president suggest could be the next move here?
OTIS: Well, when the two men met, Pence suggested that it may very well be a long, hard slog to bring about regime change in Venezuela. Pence announced some new sanctions against four Venezuelan state governors who the U.S. blames for promoting some of the violence over the weekend. He said more sanctions would be announced. And he also said that the U.S. hasn't given up on moving food and medicine into Venezuela and that they're studying some new areas along the border where they might try again.
But Pence also came out with some carrots. He urged Venezuelan military officials who are propping up Maduro to turn against his government and take up Juan Guaido's longstanding offer of amnesty. Over the weekend, about 150 officers and soldiers did defect. However, you know, as you mentioned, there weren't the massive military defections that Guaido's people were hoping for.
SHAPIRO: OK, so one big question hanging over all of this is will the U.S. take military actions to bring about regime change in Venezuela. What did Vice President Pence have to say about that today?
OTIS: He said he hopes military force isn't necessary but that it remains an option. Now, this is something the Trump administration has been saying for a long time. So it wasn't really an escalation in rhetoric. Pence did make some quite interesting comments about Colombia, which borders Venezuela and was the launching point for that failed aid convoy. And let's listen to what he said.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Colombia is our strongest partner in the region. And any who would threaten her sovereignty or security would do well not to test the commitment to our ally or the resolve of the United States of America.
OTIS: What Pence seems to be saying there is that the U.S. could be drawn into a conflict with Venezuela should there be any kind of major cross-border incidents with Colombia. And, you know, as we saw over the weekend, it's not that hard to imagine something like that happening.
SHAPIRO: Pence is not the only foreign leader in Bogota today. There are also dozens of representatives of other countries backing Juan Guaido, including other Latin American countries. What's the broader feeling about the prospect of military intervention in Venezuela?
OTIS: Latin American diplomats are saying that they're open to things like tougher sanctions. Pence wants them to, for example, restrict visas to Maduro officials, to confiscate state oil company assets in their countries, to close off their banking systems. But even before today's meetings, Latin American leaders - including the vice president of Brazil - were explicitly ruling out military intervention in Venezuela.
You know, right now there's a lot of unity in many parts of the world in terms of backing Guaido and isolating Maduro. And so there's a danger that this solidarity could break apart if there's a major push, either from within the Venezuelan opposition or the U.S. - or from some other country - to send in troops.
SHAPIRO: And so what is Guaido's next move here?
OTIS: Well, Guaido's in a tough position. He has a lot of international support but no real power. In fact, it's unclear whether Maduro's even going to let him back into Venezuela. There are efforts to open up negotiations with the Maduro government for a peaceful transfer of power. But in many past attempts at talks, Maduro has used negotiations to stall for time.
SHAPIRO: That's reporter John Otis in Bogota, Colombia. Thanks so much.

Opioid Maker Charged With Fraud In Marketing Drug As Less Prone To Abuse,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711669778/opioid-maker-charged-with-fraud-in-marketing-drug-as-less-prone-to-abuse,"Eamon Queeney/The Washington Post/Getty Images Eamon Queeney/The Washington Post/Getty Images
Federal prosecutors late Tuesday charged British drug maker Indivior with felony fraud and conspiracy for its marketing of opioid products including Suboxone. The company allegedly created a ""nationwide scheme"" in the U.S. designed to convince doctors and government insurance providers that Indivior's patented opioid medications are safer and less prone to abuse than cheaper generic alternatives.
""The indictment alleges that, rather than marketing its opioid-addiction drug responsibly, Indivior promoted it with a disregard for the truth about its safety and despite known risks of diversion and abuse,"" said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt in a statement.
Federal prosecutors claim Indivior bilked Medicare, Medicaid and other health care providers out of billions of dollars as they paid for a more expensive version of the drug, believing it to be safer. The criminal charges, filed in the western district of Virginia, stem from a joint investigation that included the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Virginia's state attorney general office, and other agencies.
The company issued a statement denying any wrongdoing. ""Key allegations made by the Justice Department are contradicted by the government's own scientific agencies,"" Indivior said on Tuesday, adding that the firm ""will contest this case vigorously and we look forward to the full facts coming out in court.""
At the heart of the 28-count indictment is Indivior's effort, beginning in 2007, to popularize a new method of delivering its Suboxone medication, which is used to treat patients suffering from opioid dependency. With a cheaper generic tablet form of the drug expected to go on sale, the company developed a dissolvable film that could be placed under the tongue, describing the new delivery system as ""less abusable"" with a ""lower risk.""
Prosecutors now say the company knew the dissolvable film version of Suboxone was potentially more dangerous, more susceptible to abuse, and included a higher risk that children might be exposed to the drug. The firm also developed a program that allegedly connected opioid-dependent patients with doctors who prescribed Suboxone ""in high doses and in suspect circumstances.""
Federal prosecutors say if Indivior is found guilty, the company should forfeit at least $3 billion in penalties. In its response, Indivior said the company acted responsibly and has played a crucial role responding to the deadly opioid epidemic. The firm also says it tried to negotiate a settlement before the charges were filed.
""We are extremely disappointed in this action by the Justice Department, which is wholly unsupported by either the facts or the law,"" Indivior's statement said."
Teenage Sisters Get Global Respect For Campaign To Rid Bali Of Plastic Bags : Goats and Soda,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/01/26/688168838/how-teenage-sisters-pushed-bali-to-say-bye-bye-to-plastic-bags,"Teenage sisters Melati and Isabel Wijsen of Bali have received many honors for their efforts to ban plastic bags.

Five years ago, two young women decided they were going to do something about the plastic problem on their island of Bali.
How young? So young one of them couldn't make it to our midweek interview. ""She's at school,"" explained 18-year-old Melati Wijsen, talking about her 16- year- old sister Isabel.
""She's just halfway through grade 11 and she's putting her focus more into graduating high school.""
About 'The Plastic Tide'
NPR is exploring one of the most important environmental issues of our time: plastic waste. Click here to read more about the topic.
Bali is part of the island nation of Indonesia, which is the world's second biggest polluter when it comes to marine plastic , trailing only China. And when ocean currents carry that plastic to the tourist island of Bali, it's a public relations nightmare. This video taken by British diver Rich Horner last year pretty much sums up the scale of the problem as he tries to navigate through a sea of plastic just below the water's surface. A New Weapon In The War Against Plastic Waste
The two sisters got the idea for Bye Bye Plastic Bags in 2013 after a lesson at school about influential world leaders — change-makers — including Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi.
""My sister and I went home that day thinking, 'Well, what can we do as kids living on the island of Bali?' "" Melati Wijsen says.
""You see, we didn't want to wait until we were older to start making a difference. It wasn't even a question, really. It was more like, what can we do, as kids, right now.""
The answer was right in front of them. Literally. On the beach in front of their home.
""It got to the point where on weekends when we would go to our childhood beach, if we went swimming there, a plastic bag would wrap around your arm, Wijsen says. ""And you say just, enough is enough.""
They went online and discovered that over 40 countries had already banned or taxed plastic bags.
""We thought, 'Well, if they can do it, c'mon, Bali! C'mon, Indonesia! We can do it, too!' "" Wijsen says. ""So, without a business plan or a strategy or a budget, like my mom will tell you, we went forward with a pure passion and intention to make our island home plastic bag free.""
They got some friends together, went online to start a petition and got 6,000 signatures in less than a day, Wijsen says. They spread awareness through school and community workshops. The organized massive beach cleanup campaigns , all the while drawing international attention and that of local politicians too. Especially when they decided to up the ante optics-wise.
""I think one of the biggest tools that pushed us forward was our decision to go on a food strike,"" Wijsen says, inspired, she says, by one of the tools used by Gandhi. ""He also had peaceful ways of reaching his goals, of getting attention, So that was a huge inspiration for us.""
The sisters put the word out about their plan on social media. Local media picked it up, and that's prompted the governor at the time, I Made Pastika, to do what any savvy politician would do when faced with two teenage girls threatening a hunger strike. He invited them to come see him. ""Within 24 hours, we had a phone call and then the next day we were picked up from school and escorted to the office of the governor,"" Wijsen says. Teen Inspires Youth Demonstrations Across Europe, Demanding Action On Climate Change
Pastika signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the sisters to work toward eliminating plastic on the island — and later pledged to rid Bali of plastic bags by 2018. That didn't happen, but the sisters kept engaging government at every level — local, municipal and national — to keep up the pressure. Melati Wijsen says she learned a lot about dealing with politicians in the process.
""Yeah, well, being 14 and skipping school on a Tuesday because I had to learn about draft regulations and suggestions really was an interesting learning curve for me,"" she says. Dancing with politicians, she says, is like three steps forward, two steps back and again, and again. It's almost like the cha-cha. I learned a lot of different things.""
Wijsen says that in the past year she's spent about 100 nights on the road with speaking engagements to get out the anti-plastic message and to talk about youth empowerment as well. The sisters have given a TED talk , spoke at the U.N. in New York and again last year at the IMF World Bank Forum in Bali. World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva called Melati ""a girl that is changing the world around her.""
They've also been named among the world's most influential teenagers by Forbes , Time magazine and CNN.
And just last month, the new governor of Bali announced a law banning single-use plastic in 2019, thanks in part to the sisters' efforts and those of like-minded NGOs.
Businesses have six months to comply or face having their business permits revoked.
Melati Wijsen was thrilled with the news. But she says there's still lots of work to be done spreading the no-plastic gospel not just in Bali and Indonesia but around the globe.
So Bye Bye Plastic Bags is multiplying. ""We're actually now in 28 locations around the world, and it's all led by young people,"" Wijsen says. ""We've created a starter kit and a handbook that guides them through this process of how to start a movement.""
She says this global expansion is one of the most inspiring parts of being part of Bye Bye Plastic Bags ""because ... we literally prove that kids can do things, and Bye Bye Plastic Bags has become this platform where kids can feel like their voices are being heard.""
She wants to continue being heard — and demanding change. And she wants other young people to do the same: ""For us, everything is happening in our lifetime, right? So we have to be the ones to start working toward the future and the world that we want to be a part of.""
In addition to efforts in Bali, the Indonesian government has pledged to do its part in eliminating the scourge of plastic pollution. It's committed to reducing plastic pollution by 70 percent by 2025. Melati Wijsen will be closely monitoring their efforts.
She's graduated from high school but is committed to her campaign: ""This is my No. 1 focus right now,"" she says. ""It consumes almost every thought in my body. I mean, it's like a full-time job.""
Is she obsessed or just focused? ""A healthy chunk of both,"" she says, laughing, adding that her mother helps keep her balanced. ""Some days, she'll just be like, 'Melati, take a day off, like go to the beach with your friends and just don't pick up the plastic, just sit there.' "" She is going to the beach — on Feb. 16, when Bye Bye Plastic Bags is planning its biggest beach cleanup ever. Correction Jan. 27, 2019

Editor's note: On Thursday, President Trump said on Twitter he had canceled a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, citing intensifying Russian aggression toward Ukraine.
In late September, the Ukrainian navy announced that two of its vessels had successfully traveled from the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov, passing through waters controlled by the Russian ""aggressor"" and exercising Ukraine's maritime rights under international law. Notes Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014, is shown with stripes on the map.

A Ukrainian news channel hailed the move as ""a brilliant and risky operation under the enemy's nose,"" while Russian media mocked the ""rusty"" ships that had ""crawled"" past the Crimean Peninsula.
On Sunday, three more Ukrainian vessels attempted to make the same journey. This time, the Russian coast guard intercepted the Ukrainians, ramming a tugboat and firing on the gunboats.
Russian authorities said that unlike before the passage in September, the Ukrainian vessels had failed to request permission and ignored orders to stop. Russia seized the three boats and took the two dozen crew members prisoner, several of whom had been injured in the clash.
Ukraine insisted on its freedom of navigation and said its seamen had become the victims of an unprovoked attack.

It is not by chance that the 4 1/2-year conflict between Ukraine and Russia has taken on a naval dimension. For Kiev, keeping the Sea of Azov open to its ships is more than just a matter of legal principle — it's a strategic and economic imperative. For the Kremlin, the challenge posed by Ukraine's tiny navy is almost entirely symbolic.
While there are real fears in Kiev of all-out war, neither country could afford a serious escalation. Following fierce combat in the first year of the conflict, the Kremlin has largely stuck to prosecuting a low-level war with occasional flare-ups. The naval skirmish over the Sea of Azov is primarily about Russia imposing on Ukraine the irreversibility of its annexation of Crimea.
The Sea of Azov is a shallow body of water that Ukraine shares with Russia. Its only access to the open seas is through the Kerch Strait, which connects it to the Black Sea.

After Russia occupied and seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin gained de facto control over both sides of the Kerch bottleneck — even if practically no other country recognized the Russian annexation de jure. In May, Russian President Vladimir Putin personally opened a 12-mile-long bridge over the Kerch Strait . The Crimean Peninsula, which juts into the Black Sea from the Ukrainian mainland, was literally cemented to Russia.
Putin's bridge is a symbol of Russia's claim on Crimea. Since Sunday's skirmish, it has also become the physical gateway to the Sea of Azov. To prevent the three Ukrainian boats from passing under the bridge, Russia placed a cargo ship below it.
Ukraine depends on the port of Mariupol to export grain and steel via the Sea of Azov. After Ukrainian authorities said Russian forces were disrupting shipping in that sea, the government in Kiev announced its intention to build a naval base at the port of Berdyansk. Enlarge this image

""Russia's purpose is to occupy the Azov Sea, the same way it did Crimea. This is a brutal violation of international law, and we cannot accept it,"" Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko told The Washington Post in September. ""We have absolutely clear legal status in the Azov Sea. Russia has no right to attack or stop our vessels.""
When the first two Ukrainian naval boats passed under the Kerch bridge to the Sea of Azov that same month, Poroshenko thanked the crews for a ""perfectly executed order"" and said the two aging vessels would be stationed at the new base. A few days later, Poroshenko traveled to Baltimore to officially receive two U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats that will be delivered to Ukraine next year.
Ukraine is no match for Russia in terms of sea power.
After Ukraine gained independence from Moscow in 1991, most of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet ended up going to Russia. In an agreement that would later prove fateful, Ukraine allowed Russia to use the Crimean port of Sevastopol as the main base for the Russian Black Sea Fleet. When Putin ordered the occupation of Crimea in February 2014, Russian forces with unmarked uniforms and vehicles fanned out across the peninsula from Russian Black Sea Fleet facilities.
Putin justified Russia's takeover as the free choice of Russian-speaking Crimeans who feared Ukrainian nationalists coming to power after street protests in Kiev brought down a Kremlin-backed government. Putin also said he couldn't countenance the presence of ""NATO sailors"" in Sevastopol should Ukraine one day join the U.S.-led alliance. Enlarge this image

Ukraine's navy estimates it lost at least 80 percent of its assets and capabilities after the annexation of Crimea, as its most important bases were located on the peninsula. Russia's seizure of the two gunboats on the weekend is a further blow.
After the clash, Poroshenko called Russia's actions at sea "" a new stage of aggression ."" If Russia's war against Ukraine had previously been clandestine, he said, Sunday's incident was an open attack. Poroshenko warned that new intelligence suggested ""an extremely serious threat of a land-based operation against Ukraine"" that warranted the imposition of martial law.
Domestic opponents of the unpopular president accused him of planning to use martial law as a way to suspend an election scheduled for March 31. Poroshenko only got Ukraine's boisterous parliament to approve the measure once he had watered down his proposal by reducing martial law — which entered into force Wednesday — to 30 days from 60, limiting it to border regions and promising not to postpone the election.
Sonya Koshkina, the editor of the Kiev news site lb.ua, wrote that Poroshenko's lack of transparency in pushing through martial law had increased ""the gap between the government and the Ukrainian people."" Ukrainian journalist Maxim Eristavi warned that martial law itself could crush Ukraine's fledgling democracy .
While Putin blamed Poroshenko for a pre-election ""provocation"" to boost his sagging popularity, the flare-up in tensions doesn't exactly hurt the Russian president domestically either.
After his triumphant re-election to a fourth term in March, Putin's approval ratings have taken a hit amid anger over the government's raising of the retirement age, rising fuel prices and tax hikes. The portion of Russians who say they trust Putin has dropped 20 percentage points to 39 percent within less than a year, according to the independent Levada Center. His popularity was at an all-time high after the annexation of Crimea.
Ukraine's biggest problem in its struggle with its giant neighbor is keeping the world's attention — especially that of the United States.
While the leaders of NATO, the European Union and Germany spoke out against Russia's seizure of the Ukrainian boats and their crews, President Trump left it to his ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, to condemn the move as an ""outrageous violation of sovereign Ukrainian territory.""
In a Monday interview with The Washington Post , Trump suggested he may cancel a meeting with Putin planned for later this week as a result of the naval clash.
But in a White House briefing the next day, national security adviser John Bolton made no mention of any cancellation and indicated that Haley had spoken the administration's final word on the Kerch Strait incident."
The Legacy Of 'The Godfather' At 50: How It Sparked One Afghan Man's Imagination,www.npr.org,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/03/09/701734022/opinion-how-the-godfather-sparked-imagination-in-afghanistan,"Mario Puzo is the author of The Godfather .

It's hard to forecast the influence a work of art may have. Fifty years ago, Mario Puzo wrote a book in his basement after his first two novels had won splendid reviews but sold poorly.
In 1969, The Godfather was published.
One of the more than 30 million copies sold wound up in a pile of books on the street in Kabul, Afghanistan, in the mid-1990s. All Western literature, from Cervantes to Shakespeare to, well, Puzo, had been removed from the library during Afghanistan's civil war. Afghans would buy the books to burn the pages for heat, then tie the covers around their feet as makeshift shoes.
A young student named Zalmai Yawar saw a copy of The Godfather and placed it in a heap of books he hauled off in his arms for about 8 cents. Zalmai says that because it was a paperback, it wouldn't make good shoes, so he decided to try to read it.
He didn't read or write English. English education had been forbidden under Soviet domination, but Zalmai still had his father's old English-Pashto dictionary and translated the novel, in secret, word by word.
And he loved it. He saw The Godfather as a story of tribal rivalries, blood grudges and family loyalties.
When the Taliban came to power in 1996, Zalmai says he learned to look away from the religious police, who often beat people on the street for imagined disobedience, because he recalled a passage from The Godfather in which Don Vito Corleone counsels, ""Never let anyone ... know what you are thinking.""
When producer Peter Breslow and I came to Kabul to report on the war in 2002, Zalmai was our indispensable interpreter and guide. After he told us how he loved The Godfather , we began to call him ""consigliere"" and ""Zally,"" à la ""Sally,"" a name straight out of the story.
I remember a night in the hills of Bamiyan, where the Taliban had blown up statues of Buddha and left behind mass graves. Zally told me to look into the sky and said, ""When you live in the mountains, like we do, the stars become your neighbors.""
During Afghanistan's civil war, Zalmai Yawar translated The Godfather using his father's old English-Pashto dictionary. David Riese hide caption toggle caption During Afghanistan's civil war, Zalmai Yawar translated The Godfather using his father's old English-Pashto dictionary. David Riese
Zalmai Yawar came to the United States after Peter and I returned. He graduated from Amherst College in 2006. He's studying for his Ph.D. in geology at Indiana University, where Zally and his adviser help a group of geologists analyze images from the Mars Science Lab.
I think Mario Puzo would appreciate how an old copy of his book about blood and love wound up on a pile on another side of the world, just in time to nourish a young man's imagination. Art can lead to the most amazing places."

Kristen Hartke for NPR/
The 40 days of Lent, which began last week, are a time when many Christians around the world decide to voluntarily give up bad habits or luxuries. This year, it might be time we all consider how to give up – or at least reduce – our reliance on disposable products .
A year ago, I decided to create a more environmentally friendly and sustainable kitchen, focusing particularly on reducing my use of disposable products such as plastic sandwich bags, aluminum foil and paper towels.
It's worth the effort: Americans toss 185 pounds of plastic per person each year while also going through 13 billion pounds of paper towels as a nation. Aluminum foil sounds like a ""natural"" alternative to a lot of people, but it can actually take a hundred years or more to biodegrade. If composting kitchen scraps or reusing old coffee grounds for a body scrub seems like a step too far, there are a few simple ways to reduce the environmental footprint of your kitchen without sacrificing modern conveniences.
I'm not going to sugarcoat my experience. It takes commitment and a willingness to change long-held habits. In creating my sustainable kitchen, I tried a lot of different alternative products and some plain old common sense; the result, however, has been worth the effort. I'm recycling more and relying less on single-use products. The kicker: I'm saving money too.
Want to reduce reliance on plastics in your kitchen? Here are four steps that I found can stand the test of time:
Invest in alternative storage. I'm not kidding when I say that I used to really love plastic storage bags, from snack-size to gallon-size zip-top bags — so this was, perhaps, the biggest challenge for me. Switching to reusable storage bags was a financial investment up front, but the cost was reasonable considering that I previously spent at least $100 annually on disposable plastic bags and wrap. My favorites: Stashers, heavy-duty reusable silicone zip-top bags that can go from the freezer to the microwave ($10 to $20 each), and Food Huggers, silicone disks that slip over the ends of cut pieces of fruits and vegetables ($12.95 for a set of five), are functional and durable (except for that avocado-shaped Hugger, which I want to love but it never really fits correctly). Fabrics coated in beeswax are handy for wrapping sandwiches or oddly shaped pieces of food and for covering bowls; variety packs from Bee's Wrap, Abeego, and Etee all run about $18, while Trader Joe's has a pack for under $10, but you can also make your own . For packing lunches, consider the highly affordable Japanese bento box , designed with food compartments that negate the need for disposable wraps. The proof is in the pudding: I haven't purchased any disposable plastic bags for a full year.
Recycle. Really recycle. Americans are estimated to recycle just 30 percent of the recyclable materials that they consume each day. Plastic and glass bottles and jars, aluminum cans and newspaper are common items that we've gotten used to throwing in the recycling bin, but milk, eggs, Tetra Pak cartons, pizza boxes and plastic deli and pet food containers are also items that may be accepted at local recycling centers ; check online periodically in your local jurisdiction for recycling updates. TerraCycle offers a pack-and-ship zero-waste box for a wide variety of non-organic kitchen items, from party supplies to silicone or mixed-material food containers. The company recommends getting together a group of friends, neighbors or co-workers to purchase and contribute to the box. (They cost from $130 to $475 and range in size from 11"" x 11"" x 20"" to 15"" x 15"" x 37"", but the largest box — split among a group or sponsored by an employer — can be the most cost-effective.) Once the filled box is returned to TerraCycle, the company will sort the waste into four categories (fabrics, metals, fibers and plastics) that are then recycled, upcycled or reused — depending on the type of material. The company also works with a wide range of manufacturers to offer free recycling of individual hard-to-recycle items, like Brita water filters and Clif Bar energy bar wrappers.
Keep it clean and eco-friendly at the same time. I'm a clean freak and used to go through an unseemly amount of paper towels on a daily basis, but it's easy enough to take old T-shirts or towels and cut them up to use to wipe down surfaces. (If you're cleaning surfaces that have been in contact with raw meat, poultry or fish, throw those towels in the washing machine to get them really clean.) I'm also a fan of bamboo paper towels, which have the look and feel of traditional paper towels, yet are made from a highly renewable source and also break down in landfills in just 45 days. Better yet, they can be reused up to 100 times. I can attest to how sturdy they are because I bought a single roll of bamboo paper towels for $7 a full year ago and still have more than half the roll left, using a single bamboo towel to clean my countertops and stove for a few weeks until it's worn out (rinse the sheet in hot water, then wring and let air dry). When I consider that I probably spent up to $15 a month on single-use paper towels before, that roll of bamboo paper towels was a huge bargain. As for kitchen sponges, keep an eye out for those made with natural materials, because typical polyurethane sponges cannot be recycled and end up in landfills.
Think before you buy. In our disposable society, it's easy to purchase items that are convenient but not sustainable — and more environmentally friendly options are generally available once you know what to look for. Juice boxes that include plastic straws, dishwasher tabs individually wrapped in plastic and coffee makers that use K-Cups are all examples of items that can create additional waste. When grocery shopping, ask yourself if you really need to use individual plastic bags in the produce section for those lemons, potatoes or apples. Consider packaging as you peruse the shelves for your favorite purchases, from cookies to pasta to frozen pizza. For instance, the plastic window on that pasta box may make it convenient for you to see what the pasta inside looks like, but the mixed-material container can be a problem for some recycling facilities. When purchasing bulk pantry or other household items online from companies like Amazon or Jet, ask to have them shipped in as few boxes as possible to cut down on the number of boxes you receive, and if you get a single small item sent in a huge box, let the company know that you'd prefer that it pay more attention to how it is packaging items for delivery.

"Kenya, Zimbabwe, Other African Nations Hold Lessons For Venezuela",www.npr.org,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/03/09/700880670/reporters-notebook-africa-holds-lessons-for-venezuela,"Embed Embed Transcript
Tens of thousands of people gathered at Uhuru Park in Nairobi as opposition leader Raila Odinga promised to defy the official election results and the government by declaring himself president.
Kenya was months into a standoff between Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta. The country had held two elections. The first was thrown out by the country's Supreme Court, the second was boycotted by Odinga. Some opposition strongholds were so beset by violence the second time that polls never opened. At least 100 opposition supporters were reported killed by police and pro-government groups, with some estimates even higher.

By the time Odinga announced his intent to ""inaugurate"" himself as president, the government had had enough. It felt a lot like Venezuela: two men claiming the presidency in a high-stakes jostle for power.
But unlike Guaidó, who has been recognized as the legitimate leader of Venezuela by more than 50 countries including the United States, the U.S. had warned Odinga against taking the oath of office.
Kenya's government had promised a violent crackdown and that it would charge Odinga with treason, which is punishable by death, if he went through with his plans.
Just as Venezuela's security agents have come out in force, the streets of Nairobi were militarized in advance of the opposition event in the park. Paramilitary police, armored vehicles and water cannons were stationed at nearly every corner. The crowd at Uhuru Park has grown exponentially since morning and people are still filing in. #NASAOathDay pic.twitter.com/WOWZbPUUvx — Eyder Peralta (@eyderp) January 30, 2018
Yet every inch of Uhuru Park was packed with Kenyans willing to face off with security forces. Everyone I spoke to wanted Odinga to declare himself president, and after that, they wanted to march with him to the presidential palace and take it by force.
The security forces retreated. They didn't fire tear gas, they didn't shoot or beat anyone as they had in the past. And at that moment, it became clear that Odinga had won over the majority of Kenyans.
Similarly, in Venezuela, the opposition mobilized a sea of people to the streets of Caracas saying "" somos mayoría "" — we are the majority.
Odinga arrived at that park to deafening applause. He quickly took the oath of office and, then, without any explanation, told everyone to go home.
Odinga's running mate and other opposition members did not show up to the ceremony, where they risked being arrested or seeing a bloodbath.
Months later, in a surprise move in March, Odinga shook hands with President Kenyatta, pledging to work with him toward reconciliation, and has stopped talking about a rebellion.
Zimbabwe's repression
In Zimbabwe, a similar opportunity to depose a longtime government dissipated just as easily.
It was Aug. 1, 2018. The opposition had just competed in Zimbabwe's freest elections since the country ended minority white rule and became Zimbabwe in 1980. It was also the first election without Robert Mugabe on ballot.

So, it was without a doubt the chance of a lifetime to oust the ZANU-PF party that had ruled Zimbabwe for almost four decades. But as the votes came in, observers noted vast irregularities and it became clear that Emmerson Mnangagwa, once Mugabe's deputy and now the head of ZANU-PF, would soon be declared the winner.

Creators Of Anti-Abortion Film To Testify That Twitter Censors Them : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711693259/creators-of-anti-abortion-film-to-testify-that-twitter-censors-them,"Creators Of Anti-Abortion Film To Testify That Twitter Censors Them Creators Of Anti-Abortion Film To Testify That Twitter Censors Them Embed Embed
The anti-abortion, Christian movie Unplanned is in theaters at a time when there's renewed debate about abortion. The film's creators accuse Twitter of suppressing their account.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Conservatives who say they have been censored by tech companies are going to be on Capitol Hill today. Among those testifying at the Senate hearing is one of the creators of an anti-abortion Christian film that recently opened in theaters nationwide. It is called ""Unplanned,"" and it tells the story of a former Planned Parenthood clinic director from Texas who is now an anti-abortion rights activist.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""UNPLANNED"")
ASHLEY BRATCHER: (As Abby Johnson) Hi. My name is Abby Johnson. I used to be the director of this clinic. I quit because my conscience wouldn't let me stay.
MARTIN: It's a small-budget film, and it is exceeding expectations at the box office. NPR's Sarah McCammon joins us now to talk about the movie and its impact.
Hey, Sarah.
SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Morning, Rachel.
MARTIN: Just introduce us to the story here in ""Unplanned.""
MCCAMMON: Well, it's based on the autobiography of Abby Johnson, and we just heard that clip. She says that in 2009, after having worked at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Bryan, Texas, for several years, she witnessed an abortion procedure that led to a change of heart about abortion. And this film has earned already close to $13 million, which isn't bad for a film that just had a budget of $6 million. It's been in the box office for a couple of weeks, and it's stayed in the top 10. And, Rachel, Abby Johnson, whose character's portrayed in the film, she now leads an organization called And Then There Were None that encourages other clinic workers to leave their jobs.
Now, about this hearing - anti-abortion activists accuse Twitter of censoring the film's account by temporarily blocking it a couple weeks ago. Twitter says the account was mistakenly blocked by an automated system but was put back online right away as soon as that mistake was brought to their attention.
MARTIN: And who's behind the film? I mean, who are the producers? Who's making this film happen?
MCCAMMON: Right. Some of the creators include the same team behind another relatively high-profile Christian movie that some folks might have heard of called ""God's Not Dead."" And it got some funding from some prominent conservatives. Also, it's been getting a lot of support from abortion rights opponents who would like to see more restrictions on the procedure and would like to see all public funding to groups like Planned Parenthood cut off. And its supporters include Vice President Mike Pence, who's tweeted support for it.
MARTIN: The film portrays Planned Parenthood in a negative light, I think it's fair to say. What's the organization - how are they responding to this? Are they responding?
MCCAMMON: Well, Planned Parenthood has disputed some of Abby Johnson's claims for a long time. She wrote an autobiography by the same name, ""Unplanned."" And they dispute the circumstances that led to her resignation as well as the portrayal of some of Planned Parenthood's facilities and procedures. I talked to a former vice president of Planned Parenthood who now runs a communications firm, Elizabeth Toledo. She describes this film as propaganda.
ELIZABETH TOLEDO: It's a drama. It's not a documentary. It's not a real-life account of what actually happens at Planned Parenthood or any medical provider.
MCCAMMON: And Toledo says she believes the timing of the film is meant to tap into the renewed political battles we've been seeing around abortion rights.
MARTIN: Well, is this about politics? Because, you know, the election, 2020, is around the corner, and Christians in particular have long felt like Hollywood has just ignored them, that that is not a space for them, that pop culture is not a place where they can get their political views out there.
MCCAMMON: That's right. And so there is a lot of excitement, a lot of grassroots excitement, among church groups, conservative groups, again, conservative leaders about this film. And this is out at a moment where abortion rights are sort of - there's a battle about them being waged in a lot of state legislatures that was sort of sparked by the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who, of course, has tilted the court to the right.
There's a lot of - a lot of eyes are watching what will happen with abortion rights as some of these restrictive measures that have passed in state legislatures in recent weeks, including banning abortion as early as six weeks, as those work their way through the court system, potentially to the Supreme Court. And it is, of course, coming up in the 2020 presidential campaign. President Trump has used it as a - the issue of abortion as a rallying cry. So it's not clear, Rachel, whether this film, ""Unplanned,"" will change any minds about abortion, but it is certainly rallying some members of the Republican base at a key time.
MARTIN: NPR's Sarah McCammon for us this morning.
Sarah, thanks. We appreciate it.

New York Ramps Up The Battle Against A Measles Outbreak In Brooklyn : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711693252/new-york-ramps-up-the-battle-against-a-measles-outbreak-in-brooklyn,"New York is mandating measles vaccines in certain Brooklyn zip codes where there is an outbreak of the disease — mostly affecting the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
There's a measles outbreak in New York City - the largest there in nearly 30 years. The city has declared a public health emergency, and the Health Department is taking a drastic step. They are mandating that everyone who is unimmunized and living in the affected areas has to get vaccinated unless they can prove a medical exemption. From member station WNYC, Gwynne Hogan reports.
GWYNNE HOGAN, BYLINE: Adults and children in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, are now required to get the measles vaccine. They could be fined up to $1,000 if they don't. This announcement comes as the number of measles cases has more than doubled in the last six weeks. The outbreak has mostly impacted the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community here. And with Passover gatherings coming up, there's concern it could worsen. Deputy Mayor Dr. Herminia Palacio.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
HERMINIA PALACIO: When you make the decision not to vaccinate your child, please understand you're also making that decision for the people around your child.
HOGAN: City officials said they're hoping people will voluntarily comply, but if during investigations of measles cases, health inspectors find an unvaccinated person was exposed, that person could be fined if they refuse the vaccine. Community leader Rabbi David Niederman says he doesn't think it will get to that point.
DAVID NIEDERMAN: I am convinced people will learn how the Department of Health is committed, and it will never get to fines because everybody is going to be vaccinated.
HOGAN: But Dr. Jay Begun, a pediatrician in the neighborhood who's treated dozens of measles cases, says no community will get 100 percent compliance.
JAY BEGUN: But I'm hoping that we're able to raise the levels of immunization to achieve the herd immunity that's needed to prevent further outbreaks.
HOGAN: Begun says most of his patients don't ardently oppose vaccines; rather, they're hesitant because of misinformation about the safety of vaccines. He recalled one recent conversation with a parent who said they weren't ready for their toddler to be vaccinated.
BEGUN: So I said, well, when do you think you'll be ready? There's a huge outbreak of measles in your community. If not now, when?
HOGAN: He says he hopes the city's public health emergency might sway parents like that.

Contract Cheating: Colleges Crack Down On Ghostwritten Essays,www.npr.org,Tovia Smith,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/710985799/contract-cheating-colleges-crack-down-on-ghostwritten-essays,"Enlarge this image Concern is growing about a burgeoning online market for essays that students can buy and turn in as their own work.

toggle caption Angela Hsieh/NPR Concern is growing about a burgeoning online market for essays that students can buy and turn in as their own work. And schools are trying new tools to catch it.
Angela Hsieh/NPR As the recent college admissions scandal is shedding light on how parents are cheating and bribing their children's way into college, schools are also focusing on how some students may be cheating their way through college. Concern is growing about a burgeoning online market that makes it easier than ever for students to buy essays written by others to turn in as their own work. And schools are trying new tools to catch it.
It's not hard to understand the temptation for students. The pressure is enormous, the stakes are high and, for some, writing at a college level is a huge leap.
""We didn't really have a format to follow, so I was kind of lost on what to do,"" says one college freshman, who struggled recently with an English assignment. One night, when she was feeling particularly overwhelmed, she tweeted her frustration.
""It was like, 'Someone, please help me write my essay!' "" she recalls. She ended her tweet with a crying emoji. Within a few minutes, she had a half-dozen offers of help.
""I can write it for you,"" they tweeted back. ""Send us the prompt!""
The student, who asked that her name not be used for fear of repercussions at school, chose one that asked for $10 per page, and she breathed a sigh of relief.
""For me, it was just that the work was piling up,"" she explains. ""As soon as I finish some big assignment, I get assigned more things, more homework for math, more homework for English. Some papers have to be six or 10 pages long. ... And even though I do my best to manage, the deadlines come closer and closer, and it's just ... the pressure.""
In the cat-and-mouse game of academic cheating, students these days know that if they plagiarize, they're likely to get caught by computer programs that automatically compare essays against a massive database of other writings. So now, buying an original essay can seem like a good workaround.
""Technically, I don't think it's cheating,"" the student says. ""Because you're paying someone to write an essay, which they don't plagiarize, and they write everything on their own.""
Her logic, of course, ignores the question of whether she's plagiarizing. When pressed, she begins to stammer.
""That's just a difficult question to answer,"" she says. ""I don't know how to feel about that. It's kind of like a gray area. It's maybe on the edge, kind of?""
Besides she adds, she probably won't use all of it.
Other students justify essay buying as the only way to keep up. They figure that everyone is doing it one way or another — whether they're purchasing help online or getting it from family or friends.
""Oh yeah, collaboration at its finest,"" cracks Boston University freshman Grace Saathoff. While she says she would never do it herself, she's not really fazed by others doing it. She agrees with her friends that it has pretty much become socially acceptable.
""I have a friend who writes essays and sells them,"" says Danielle Delafuente, another Boston University freshman. ""And my other friend buys them. He's just like, 'I can't handle it. I have five papers at once. I need her to do two of them, and I'll do the other three.' It's a time management thing.""
The war on contract cheating
""It breaks my heart that this is where we're at,"" sighs Ashley Finley, senior adviser to the president for the Association of American Colleges and Universities. She says campuses are abuzz about how to curb the rise in what they call contract cheating. Obviously, students buying essays is not new, but Finley says that what used to be mostly limited to small-scale side hustles has mushroomed on the internet to become a global industry of so-called essay mills. Hard numbers are difficult to come by, but research suggests that up to 16 percent of students have paid someone to do their work and that the number is rising.
""Definitely, this is really getting more and more serious,"" Finley says. ""It's part of the brave new world for sure.""
The essay mills market aggressively online, with slickly produced videos inviting students to ""Get instant help with your assignment"" and imploring them: ""Don't lag behind,"" ""Join the majority"" and ""Don't worry, be happy.""
""They're very crafty,"" says Tricia Bertram Gallant, director of the Academic Integrity Office at the University of California in San Diego and a board member of the International Center for Academic Integrity.
The companies are equally brazen offline — leafleting on campuses, posting flyers in toilet stalls and flying banners over Florida beaches during spring break. Companies have also been known to bait students with emails that look like they're from official college help centers. And they pay social media influencers to sing the praises of their services, and they post testimonials from people they say are happy customers.
""I hired a service to write my paper and I got a 90 on it!"" gloats one. ""Save your time, and have extra time to party!"" advises another.
""It's very much a seduction,"" says Bertram Gallant. ""So you can maybe see why students could get drawn into the contract cheating world.""
YouTube has been cracking down on essay mills; it says it has pulled thousands of videos that violate its policies against promoting dishonest behavior.
But new videos constantly pop up, and their hard sell flies in the face of their small-print warnings that their essays should be used only as a guide, not a final product.
Several essay mills declined or didn't respond to requests to be interviewed by NPR. But one answered questions by email and offered up one of its writers to explain her role in the company, called EduBirdie.
""Yes, just like the little birdie that's there to help you in your education,"" explains April Short, a former grade school teacher from Australia who's now based in Philadelphia. She has been writing for a year and a half for the company, which bills itself as a ""professional essay writing service for students who can't even.""
Some students just want some ""foundational research"" to get started or a little ""polish"" to finish up, Short says. But the idea that many others may be taking a paper written completely by her and turning it in as their own doesn't keep her up at night.
""These kids are so time poor,"" she says, and they're ""missing out on opportunities of travel and internships because they're studying and writing papers."" Relieving students of some of that burden, she figures, allows them to become more ""well-rounded.""
""I don't necessarily think that being able to create an essay is going to be a defining factor in a very long career, so it's not something that bothers me,"" says Short. Indeed, she thinks students who hire writers are demonstrating resourcefulness and creativity. ""I actually applaud students that look for options to get the job done and get it done well,"" she says.
""This just shows you the extent of our ability to rationalize all kinds of bad things we do,"" sighs Dan Ariely, professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University. The rise in contract cheating is especially worrisome, he says, because when it comes to dishonest behavior, more begets more. As he puts it, it's not just about ""a few bad apples.""
Law Felicity Huffman And 12 Other Parents To Plead Guilty In College Cheating Scandal ""Instead, what we have is a lot ... of blemished apples, and we take our cues for our behavior from the social world around us,"" he says. ""We know officially what is right and what's wrong. But really what's driving our behavior is what we see others around us doing"" or, Ariely adds, what we perceive them to be doing. So even the proliferation of advertising for essays mills can have a pernicious effect, he says, by fueling the perception that ""everyone's doing it.""
A few nations have recently proposed or passed laws outlawing essay mills, and more than a dozen U.S. states have laws on the books against them. But prosecuting essay mills, which are often based overseas in Pakistan, Kenya and Ukraine, for example, is complicated. And most educators are loath to criminalize students' behavior.
""Yes, they're serious mistakes. They're egregious mistakes,"" says Cath Ellis, an associate dean and integrity officer at the University of New South Wales, where students were among the hundreds alleged to have bought essays in a massive scandal in Australia in 2014.
""But we're educational institutions,"" she adds. ""We've got to give students the opportunity to learn from these mistakes. That's our responsibility. And that's better in our hands than in the hands of the police and the courts.""
Staying one step ahead
In the war on contract cheating, some schools see new technology as their best weapon and their best shot to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous students. The company that makes the Turnitin plagiarism detection software has just upped its game with a new program called Authorship Investigate.
The software first inspects a document's metadata, like when it was created, by whom it was created and how many times it was reopened and re-edited. Turnitin's vice president for product management, Bill Loller, says sometimes it's as simple as looking at the document's name. Essay mills typically name their documents something like ""Order Number 123,"" and students have been known to actually submit it that way. ""You would be amazed at how frequently that happens,"" says Loller.
Using cutting-edge linguistic forensics, the software also evaluates the level of writing and its style.
""Think of it as a writing fingerprint,"" Loller says. The software looks at hundreds of telltale characteristics of an essay, like whether the author double spaces after a period or writes with Oxford commas or semicolons. It all gets instantly compared against a student's other work, and, Loller says, suspicions can be confirmed — or alleviated — in minutes.
""At the end of the day, you get to a really good determination on whether the student wrote what they submitted or not,"" he says, ""and you get it really quickly.""
Coventry University in the U.K. has been testing out a beta version of the software, and Irene Glendinning, the school's academic manager for student experience, agrees that the software has the potential to give schools a leg up on cheating students. After the software is officially adopted, ""we'll see a spike in the number of cases we find, and we'll have a very hard few years,"" she says. ""But then the message will get through to students that we've got the tools now to find these things out."" Then, Glendinning hopes, students might consider contract cheating to be as risky as plagiarizing.
In the meantime, schools are trying to spread the word that buying essays is risky in other ways as well.
Professor Ariely says that when he posed as a student and ordered papers from several companies, much of it was ""gibberish"" and about a third of it was actually plagiarized.
Even worse, when he complained to the company and demanded his money back, they resorted to blackmail. Still believing him to be a student, the company threatened to tell his school he was cheating. Others say companies have also attempted to shake down students for more money, threatening to rat them out if they didn't pay up.
The lesson, Ariely says, is ""buyer beware.""
But ultimately, experts say, many desperate students may not be deterred by the risks — whether from shady businesses or from new technology.
Bertram Gallant, of UC San Diego, says the right way to dissuade students from buying essays is to remind them why it's wrong.
""If we engage in a technological arms race with the students, we won't win,"" she says. ""What are we going to do when Google glasses start to look like regular glasses and a student wears them into an exam? Are we going to tell them they can't wear their glasses because we're afraid they might be sending the exam out to someone else who is sending them back the answers?""
The solution, Bertram Gallant says, has to be about ""creating a culture where integrity and ethics matter"" and where education is valued more than grades. Only then will students believe that cheating on essays is only cheating themselves."
Johnson Publishing Company Files For Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Protection : NPR,www.npr.org,Karen Grigsbates,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711693280/johnson-publishing-company-files-for-chapter-7-bankruptcy-protection,"The Chicago publishing giant that launched Ebony and Jet magazines, and made them a touchstone in African-American life, is closing its doors. It plans a court- supervised sale of its assets.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
It was the name behind iconic magazines like Ebony and Jet. But Johnson Publishing Company - one of the most successful black-owned corporations in U.S. history - has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. The Chicago-based company has been struggling in recent years. Karen Grigsby Bates from our Code Switch podcast has more.
KAREN GRIGSBY BATES, BYLINE: In a 2002 interview with the National Visionary Leadership Project, Ebony's founder, John H. Johnson, was very firm about his magazine's mission.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JOHN H JOHNSON: Ebony is a magazine devoted to making people feel good, making people proud of their heritage.
GRIGSBY BATES: Until that time, most black Americans didn't show up in the mainstream media, unless the stories were about criminal activity or destitution. John Johnson wanted them to see something else.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JOHNSON: First time I ever saw a black person in print in a tuxedo was in Ebony.
GRIGSBY BATES: That formula showcasing black achievement and prosperity kept Ebony flush for decades. It financed a landmark tower on tony Michigan Avenue and a nationally known haute couture fashion show. But the publishing world was changing and shrinking. John Johnson died in 2005. And his daughter, Linda Johnson Rice, tried to run the company before selling Ebony to a pair of black venture capitalists in 2016. The duo soon made news for not paying several Ebony writers.
There were two remaining assets of Johnson Publishing - a stunning photo archive that is the institutional memory of post-war black America, and its Fashion Fair cosmetics line. Now those, too, will be sold. Fans of Fashion Fair, the first high-end makeup for black women, had been worried for a while that e-commerce was killing the brand. Late last year on YouTube, makeup artist Lashelle Farrington wondered about Fashion Fair's fate.
(SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)
LASHELLE FARRINGTON: I know at the counter in my city, the person that works for the counter doesn't even know when they're going to get items in stock. It's like Russian roulette.
GRIGSBY BATES: With yesterday's filing, the last bullet has left the chamber. The company's statement says an unnamed group with, quote, ""a proven track record of advancing cultural preservation and building and operating legacy brands"" has made an offer for some of those assets, and the bankruptcy trustee will evaluate the offer. And after 77 years of proud existence, the Johnson Publishing Company will soon be history.

What Would Golf Look Like If Augusta National Invited Women To Compete Earlier?,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711693294/what-would-golf-look-like-if-augusta-national-invited-women-to-compete-earlier,"David Greene talks to USA Today sports columnist Christine Brennan about the historic women's golf tournament in Augusta, Ga. It's the first time women have been allowed to compete at the club.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The Masters Tournament starts tomorrow in Augusta, Ga. And we're going to hear a lot about Tiger Woods and other players. But USA Today sports columnist Christine Brennan has been thinking about something else that just happened in the male-dominated world of golf.
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Hell has frozen over, and it's actually a good thing.
GREENE: Brennan has been in Augusta over the past week. And on Saturday, she covered an amateur women's championship. This event marked the first time women have ever competed on the storied Augusta golf course.
BRENNAN: Some golf clubs started opening their doors in the '90s, but Augusta National did not. And because it's a private club, of course, David, it can do whatever it wants. But because they're hosting the Masters, one of the four men's major golf tournaments every year, and in fact because they've become the public face of golf, there was a lot of scrutiny. I came down here for the first time 20 years ago and asked a question about if they had women members, if they had African-American members, and how many - was told that was a club matter and all club matters are private.
GREENE: Wow. Did you face discrimination as a female journalist at the club? Or they didn't do that kind of thing.
BRENNAN: Well, no, in that sense, but I did see at the first - 1999, the first press conference that I attended, they called on the men, older members calling on people for questions in the press conference. And they'd say, sir, yes, sir, over here, sir. And then when they called on a woman, it would be the little lady down front. And literally I felt, David, that I'd left my home in Washington, D.C., come down to Augusta and entered the 1940s.
GREENE: When you watch the women playing on that course in this amateur tournament just days ago, I mean, do you think they felt the weight of something important, or were they just out there playing the best golf they could?
BRENNAN: I think they did, and that's what made them so terrific. Jennifer Kupcho is the top-ranked amateur in the world, a senior at Wake Forest, and she won the tournament - had a terrific performance on Saturday. There were two days of the tournament at another golf course and then the final day Saturday in Augusta National. That was historic. That was the first time the women had ever been able to play a tournament. And then Kupcho's best - one of her best friends and rivals of course, Maria Fassi, Arkansas senior, was second. What they put on was a majestic show of sportsmanship and class - fist bumping each other, cheering each other on even as they so desperately wanted to win. I think they absolutely rose to the moment, and also, David, so did Augusta National. I saw at least 100 of the 300 members of Augusta National, in their green jackets, walking the course. So I will say that even though it took them a long time to get to this point, the members of Augusta National did put on quite a show for the women and showcasing these terrific female golfers.
GREENE: Does this make up for years of discrimination?
BRENNAN: David, they're trying, but I think it's too little, too late. I mean, if they had put on women's tournament 20 years ago, what would golf look like today? Instead, they put up a stop sign. And at the exact same time as the Augusta National is doing that, you've got this Title IX revolution, this wave of women athletes. They're running marathons and doing triathlons and doing yoga and after-work leagues for soccer leagues or volleyball. And they're going to do that and spend money on that the rest of their lives. They're not playing golf. And for the greatest capitalists among us, the men who play golf - and some women - to see them choose sexism over capitalism, over selling golf balls and selling golf clothes and selling golf equipment to 51 percent of the population was stunning. And I watched it happen and wrote about it for 20 years, so it's great to see the women on the golf course now. But I think the message comes way too late for the game of golf.
GREENE: USA Today sports columnist and frequent guest on our program, which is great for us, that's Christine Brennan.

'The Atlantic' On Stephen Miller: 'Trump's Right-Hand Troll',www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711693273/the-atlantic-on-stephen-miller-trumps-right-hand-troll,"Heard on Morning Edition
David Greene talks to McKay Coppins, a writer for The Atlantic , about Stephen Miller, President Trump's top immigration adviser, and Miller's role in setting White House policy.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
So the secretary of Homeland Security is out. So is President Trump's original nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement. All of this as the president says he wants tougher border policies. So what's behind this? Or perhaps the real question is, who is behind this?
There's renewed focus right now on Stephen Miller, the 33-year-old presidential aide who's considered one of the driving forces behind Trump's immigration policies. This is Miller on Fox News, defending the president's decision in February to declare a national emergency at the southern border.
(SOUNDBITE OF FOX BROADCAST)
STEPHEN MILLER: The bottom line is this. You cannot conceive of a nation without a strong, secure border. It is fundamental and essential to the idea of sovereignty and national survival to have control over who enters and doesn't enter the country.
GREENE: McKay Coppins has spent some time getting to know Stephen Miller. He profiled him for The Atlantic last year. And he's with us in our studios.
McKay, welcome.
MCKAY COPPINS: Thanks for having me.
GREENE: So the narrative out there is there's this shadowy figure - Stephen Miller - looming behind the president's big decisions on the border. How true is that narrative, do you think?
COPPINS: Well, you know, I think that the reason that Stephen Miller has been so successful in this White House at kind of garnering power and positioning himself is because his instincts on immigration align with President Trump's. He is a fierce ideologue, a fierce restrictionist - has been for most of his life. But he also is somebody who the president, I'm told, trusts more than virtually anyone else in the West Wing or in his orbit to kind of advance the immigration agenda that President Trump rose to power by promising to advance. And that's what kind of makes him powerful.
He has - especially in recent weeks - gained more power than he has. But he has always been a key adviser with the president's ear on immigration issues. And a lot of the most divisive episodes that we've seen, from the travel ban in the opening days of Trump's presidency all the way to the national emergency that you just mentioned...
GREENE: Yeah.
COPPINS: ...Have had Stephen Miller kind of as a central figure in pushing those things.
GREENE: You've sat down in his office in the White House. What's he like?
COPPINS: Yeah, it's interesting. You know, you played that clip just now, and he comes across on television as, you know, this almost kind of self-conscious supervillain.
GREENE: (Laughter).
COPPINS: He's out there trying to provoke ire, trying to defend the president in the - kind of the most aggressive terms possible. In person, he does that as well, but you can kind of see the cracks in the facade. It's clear to me, especially having spent time with him and talking to people who have known him throughout his life, that he enjoys - almost delights in - the provocation. You know, he comes from a kind of conservative campus trolling culture, where his goal often is not to persuade people or to win people over, but to provoke them. And that really comes through when you're spending time with him.
GREENE: Yeah. I mean, talk about that, that desire - almost delight, as you say - to provoke. This goes back to when he grew up, I mean, in the liberal bastion that is Santa Monica, Calif. - right? - when he was young.
COPPINS: (Laughter) Yeah, that's right. He grew up in a kind of very diverse, liberal, multicultural community and high school where he was kind of the resident conservative gadfly. And he would loudly complain and protest the Spanish-language announcements that came over the PA system at school. He would - he ran for office, student body office, by complaining about having to pick up trash when the janitors should be there to do it for them.
He is really somebody who has always kind of tried to offend the sensibilities and feelings of his liberal peers. That goes from high school to college to when he arrives in Washington and Capitol Hill as an aide to Jeff Sessions. He's always kind of looking for a way to stir the pot and kind of anger his ideological and political adversaries.
GREENE: You say that President Trump has an alignment of views with him. You say that President Trump trusts him. Do you get the sense there's anyone in the White House who makes an effort to check his power and influence?
COPPINS: Yeah. Well, certainly, I think that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are not aligned with Stephen Miller on immigration issues. But again, you know, what I'm told from people who have observed this dynamic up close is that the president understands that Jared and Ivanka come from a different world - right? - and they're more aligned with kind of a moderate-to-liberal sensibility on this issue, and - whereas Stephen Miller really aligns with the Trump base. And that's why he keeps turning to him again and again for advice.
GREENE: McKay Coppins is a writer for The Atlantic profile with Stephen Miller, who seems to be playing a bigger and bigger role right now in President Trump's immigration policies.
McKay, thanks a lot.

European Union leaders meet in Brussels Wednesday for an emergency summit to decide whether to offer British Prime Minister Theresa May another delay to negotiate the U.K.'s departure.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Brexit is a total mess still. Politicians in the United Kingdom still can't agree on a way to leave the EU, which is why Prime Minister Theresa May is heading to Brussels today to ask the EU for another extension before the clock runs out on Friday. In recent days, she's been in Berlin and Paris seeking the support of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. Now, for more, we turn to NPR's Mr. Brexit, Frank Langfitt in London. Hi there, Frank.
FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey, David.
GREENE: OK. So Friday is the big day that Britain could crash out with no plan at all. So is the prime minister basically just saying she needs more time?
LANGFITT: She does need more time. She's going to ask - she's asking for an extension to June 30. And what she needs is exactly what you're talking about, David - time to find some consensus on leaving the EU. She's under a lot of pressure from Brexiteers here to get out as soon as possible. She wants to do it before she would have to seat U.K. members in the European Parliament. The new Parliament opens in early July. So she's looking for a short window to try to do something that the British Parliament and the prime minister have failed to do now for, like, upwards of two years.
GREENE: Yeah. I mean - and all those failures to get any sort of agreement, I mean, has to have EU leaders feeling very impatient. What - how are they going to react?
LANGFITT: They're exasperated, but we do expect there'll be some kind of extension. And the reason for that is just what you were pointing out earlier, David. It's in nobody's interest that the United Kingdom just walk away from the European Union without any way to sort out how things would work at the ports and things like that. You'd have tariffs, big lines of trucks, things along those lines. One thing the EU, of course, wants to hear is what's the plan? How are they going to break this deadlock in Parliament? Donald Tusk - he's the president of the European Council - he is suggesting a long extension, talking about up to a year. And the reason for this, one, is I think they're tired of the U.K. continuing to blow through deadlines and, frankly, dominating the EU agenda.
And any extension, David, is going to have to have conditions. And one is going to be the U.K. not disrupting the EU if it remains inside for many, many months longer. There is a concern in Brussels that when Prime Minister May leaves office, whenever that is, there could be a Brexiteer prime minister who comes in here and the U.K. could actually become a Trojan horse inside the EU and be disruptive.
GREENE: How are people in Britain feeling at this moment? I mean, this Brexit has divided society. It's paralyzed politics. Like, could people tolerate another delay and uncertainty for, like, up to another year?
LANGFITT: I think it's - there's a lot of different feelings, and I don't think people have felt like this in Britain in decades. There's bitterness. There's distrust. There's complete Brexit fatigue. A lot of people just say get it over with, which is a very British approach to things. Even if something isn't going to work out all that well, it's, you know...
GREENE: Just do it.
LANGFITT: It is. It's a stiff upper lip. It's a bit of a cliche, but it's true. Remainers, they want a second vote. They feel that Brexiteers presented a way too rosy picture of all of this and lied about what was going to happen. Obviously, it's turned into chaos. Brexiteers fear that Brexit is going to actually be cancelled and that this whole vote from 2016 is going to be stolen from voters. They also - you know, you were just talking about earlier the prime minister going to see Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Merkel. They feel that the U.K. is a supplicant, and they feel that this is kind of nationally humiliating; so a lot of very mixed feelings right now, a lot of divisions.
GREENE: And what about the view in Europe, across Europe?
LANGFITT: Well, many, I think, in Europe are baffled and stunned by this. I was in Copenhagen over the weekend. And I was talking to a friend who just was stunned by the bitterness and anger and chaos in Parliament, which many in Europe have admired for a long time. Another person I talked to in Denmark, she pointed out that the U.K. is Denmark's closest ally. And she just feels very sad about all this. One thing interesting, David, is the chaos is such that it's actually bound people closer to the EU. It has higher ratings now than it did a number of years ago. And that's because Brexit has gone so badly so far.
GREENE: All right. NPR's Frank Langfitt, the latest on Brexit in London.
Frank, thanks.
LANGFITT: Happy to do it, David. "
Israel's Parliamentary Election Will Decide Netanyahu's Political Future,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711693235/israels-parliamentary-election-will-decide-netanyahus-political-future,"With almost all votes counted, it appears Prime Minister Netanyahu has the best chances of forming a government of right-wing parties. But the race isn't entirely over yet.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
It appears Benjamin Netanyahu has survived a close election and is headed to his fourth consecutive term as Israel's prime minister. Both Netanyahu and his rival, Benny Gantz, declared victory last night. But with nearly all the votes counted and a mix of right-wing parties ready to join with Netanyahu, he clearly has the best chance of forming a government. NPR's Daniel Estrin is in Jerusalem this morning and joins us now. Hi, Daniel.
DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Good morning.
MARTIN: So clearly, this is very close. Is Netanyahu going to pull it out?
ESTRIN: Well, it does look like Netanyahu has the best chances. This morning, when nearly all of the votes were counted, Gantz and Netanyahu - Gantz is Netanyahu's centrist rival - both of them were tied in the number of seats that they are expected to win in Parliament. So Gantz has not yet conceded the race. But it appears that there is, as you said, a clear majority of right-wing and nationalist and religious Jewish parties that won. And that would make it easiest for Netanyahu to form the government.
MARTIN: You were out and about, talking with Israelis when they were voting yesterday. What'd you hear?
ESTRIN: Well, I started by visiting the polling station where Netanyahu himself cast his ballot. And one of the first people I saw walking into that polling station was a former government minister in Netanyahu's own party, Dan Meridor. And I asked him this question.
Can you tell us who you're voting for?
DAN MERIDOR: Yeah, I vote (foreign language spoken).
ESTRIN: He said he was voting for Netanyahu's rival. He is upset with Netanyahu's corruption scandals. And as he was saying that, a woman named Shoshana Tal (ph) was walking out of the polling station. And she heard what he had to say, and she said this.
SHOSHANA TAL: (Foreign language spoken).
ESTRIN: She was saying, what is so bad about this country? What? Things are so good right now. When did people have - travel so much abroad? You hear a lot from Netanyahu supporters that the economy's doing really well, and they feel great in Israel, so why change?
MARTIN: So what about Palestinians, I mean, especially those living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip? What are they saying about the potential of a fifth Netanyahu term?
ESTRIN: Right. Well, Palestinians in the Palestinian territories do not have the right to vote in Israeli elections. Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said that the results look quite bad for the prospects of ending Israel's occupation in the West Bank. Here's what he said.
SAEB EREKAT: They want their occupation to be endless. And they want us to live under a continued, deeper apartheid system than the one that existed in the darkest hours of South Africa's apartheid.
ESTRIN: And just days before elections, Netanyahu vowed to begin annexing Jewish settlements in the West Bank if he's re-elected, which is a dramatic promise. And if he does so, that could make it impossible for Israel and the Palestinians to reach a peace deal. And another thing to remember here is that President Trump's team has promised to release its peace plan after elections - shortly after elections. We'll see if that happens.
But the Palestinians have already rejected Trump's role as peacemaker. And the question is, will the new government expected to be formed by Netanyahu - that government will be right-wing and far-right, made up of far-right parties as well - will that government be amenable to such a Trump peace plan?
MARTIN: Right, or do they even have an appetite for it at all?
ESTRIN: Right.
MARTIN: So that - I was interested - that first clip you played from that man, he actually referenced the corruption charges against Netanyahu. So clearly, if he pulls it out, it didn't matter enough to voters to deny him a victory. But, I mean, could it hamper his ability to govern?
ESTRIN: Well, that's the great question. And this could pose a threat. Let's say Netanyahu does form the next government. Within months, Netanyahu is expected to face an indictment for bribery and for other charges. And then once that happens, it could spell the beginning of the end for Netanyahu because there are questions here.
Will all of the parties in such a Netanyahu government stand by his side? Will Netanyahu's own party start preparing for the day after and maybe even hold a leadership contest within the party? And maybe there will be even new national elections next year. That's what some legal experts are forecasting. So this could be Netanyahu's shortest term if he does, in fact, secure the government.
MARTIN: All right. NPR's Daniel Estrin for us in Jerusalem this morning.
Thanks so much.

Accident Probes By Congress Often Capture Public's Attention,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711693228/accident-probes-by-congress-often-capture-publics-attention,"Rachel Martin talks to Cokie Roberts, who answers listener questions about how the government responds to major accidents such as plane crashes and mine explosions.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Two recent accidents involving the Boeing 737 Max 8 have the world and Congress looking closely at the plane's design. And now Congress is investigating the Federal Aviation Administration's approval process and whether safety inspectors were properly trained. Texas Senator Ted Cruz chairs a subcommittee on aviation and space, and he's already held one hearing.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TED CRUZ: Welcome to each of the witnesses. On March 10, 2019, Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 departed Addis Ababa Airport with 157 souls on board.
MARTIN: Congressional investigations of accidents have often captured public attention, like the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. People followed press reports of 82 witness testimonies. Accident investigations is our subject this week for our conversation with commentator Cokie Roberts. She joins us for Ask Cokie, our weekly segment on how politics and government work.
Cokie, thanks for being here.
COKIE ROBERTS, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel.
MARTIN: So it didn't take long, did it, for Congress to jump into the 737 disaster?
ROBERTS: Well, it's a big story, Rachel, and Congress wants to be in on the act. But that's often where Congress does have an important role to play, in looking at the agencies they've set up to regulate whatever industry has had an accident, whether it's the airlines, railroads, ships, whatever.
MARTIN: So one of our listeners wants to know what effect Congress has. Bob Gundby writes the following.
(Reading) It'd be interesting to see how many investigations resulted in meaningful, regulatory change or punishment for the people involved.
Cokie?
ROBERTS: Punishment usually comes in the form of huge payouts by the companies involved. But occasionally, individuals are charged. Here's Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Fritz Hollings in 1989 challenging the chairman of Exxon after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
FRITZ HOLLINGS: Isn't it the case that the record shows this particular master of the vessel had three convictions of driving under the influence of alcohol? In other words, he had an alcohol problem?
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yes, sir. It shows that.
HOLLINGS: Man, that'd scare me to death in a boardroom if I were there on Exxon's board.
ROBERTS: In fact, the ship's captain went to trial, but a jury found him not guilty, said he was not driving drunk. But there are often regulatory changes, and in the wake of this investigation, for instance, Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, strengthening the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to prevent and clean up spills and creating a cleanup trust fund by taxing oil.
MARTIN: OK. Here's our next question.
TEAL FENTON: Hello. My name is Teal Fenton. And I am from Greenville, S.C. Why does it always seem like when the government does these investigations, there are reports that never get released? Thank you.
ROBERTS: They issue reports, all right - lengthy, detailed reports, sometimes with some fanfare. Here's former Secretary of State William Rogers at the end of the investigation into the space shuttle Challenger explosion.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
WILLIAM ROGERS: Every agency that worked with us on this report and all of the people on the commission came to the same conclusion, that the - this tragic accident was a result of the failure of that joint on the right aft booster rocket.
ROBERTS: All these reports are available to the public, including the 1,100 pages of the testimony in the Titanic hearings. In fact, after the 1997 movie about the Titanic made it popular again, a paperback was issued, ""The Titanic Disaster Hearings.""
MARTIN: A paperback of the report.
ROBERTS: A paperback of the hearings. But the report is online, as well. Just go to senate.gov, and you can find it along with just about anything else the Senate's ever done.
MARTIN: (Laughter).
ROBERTS: Same with house.gov. They do put their reports out.
MARTIN: All right. Commentator Cokie Roberts. You can ask Cokie your questions about how politics and government work by tweeting us with the hashtag #AskCokie.
Cokie, thanks so much.
ROBERTS: Good to talk to you, Rachel.

Texas Tech's School Of Medicine To Stop Considering Race In Admissions,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711693204/texas-techs-school-of-medicine-to-stop-considering-race-in-admissions,"David Greene talks to Wall Street Journal reporter Michelle Hackman, who got access to documents detailing the agreement between the Texas Tech medical school and the Department of Education.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
All right. The Trump administration has ordered the medical school at Texas Tech University to stop using race as a factor in admissions. And now one question is whether this case has broader implications for affirmative action in this country. This is the first time the administration has made this kind of demand of a school, and it comes after a 14-year federal investigation of Texas Tech's use of affirmative action. Michelle Hackman covers national education policy for The Wall Street Journal. She got access to documents detailing an agreement between the university's medical school and the Department of Education. She's with us this morning.
Welcome.
MICHELLE HACKMAN: Thanks for having me.
GREENE: So what exactly did the administration conclude here that has them making this demand?
HACKMAN: So there are two requirements if you want to use affirmative action. The first one is that your use of race when you're picking, you know, students in admissions is that it's very narrowly used. It's one factor in many. And the other is that you do regular checks. And colleges - most colleges have interpreted this to mean annual checks that race is really a factor that's uniquely helpful in sort of achieving the type of diversity that you want in a campus; that you can't use race-neutral factors like, you know, a person's income, whether someone's bilingual, things like that. And they found that Texas Tech, the medical school, had not been doing these annual checks. And so it was unclear whether their use of race was really necessary the way that they're saying it was.
GREENE: So what happens now? Is the school basically saying, yes, we weren't doing these checks, we're wrong and we're going to cooperate and stop using race?
HACKMAN: That's right. So what they signed with the Education Department is called a resolution agreement where they say we agree to stop using race to come into compliance with your view of anti-discrimination law. Now, I think what's remarkable about that is that the Education Department sort of - you know, their enforcement was that they wanted the school to immediately stop using race rather than sort of conduct the analysis that they hadn't done.
GREENE: Remind me of the broader context here because, I mean, hasn't the Supreme Court ruled several times that schools can use affirmative action if they want to increase diversity?
HACKMAN: Yes.
GREENE: So why do these legal challenges keep happening?
HACKMAN: So, you know, proponents of affirmative action would say that. They'd say the Supreme Court has said several times that race is permissible, that it's important, in fact, if you want to be able to achieve diversity. But in the 2016 case - so this was Fisher v. the University of Texas - the decision sort of left an opening for legal challenges. They said you have to do these sort of regular checks to make sure it's still necessary. And we've seen the Trump administration really lean into that and say, you know, we want this to be as narrowly tailored as possible. Last July, they actually rolled back this guidance that was almost like a roadmap that the Obama administration had created to say here's how you can use affirmative action legally. So the Trump administration took that away, sort of signaling that they were going to go ahead and try to enforce affirmative - you know, not using affirmative action as strongly as they possibly could.
GREENE: Well - and the administration is investigating policies at other places like Harvard, Yale. I mean, could this be the administration just getting started here?
HACKMAN: So I think the specifics of this case are unique to the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center. That's, you know, the larger school where the medical school's housed. But the administration does have, you know, civil rights investigations open at Harvard, at Yale, over their use of affirmative action - those cases specifically looking at Asian-American students. And so it's a question whether we'll see them continuing to enforce this really strict, narrow view of affirmative action at those schools or, you know, at possibly other schools where they could open investigations. I think it puts those schools on notice.
GREENE: Michelle Hackman covers national education policy at The Wall Street Journal.
Thanks a lot.
HACKMAN: Thank you.

Rachel Martin talks to New Zealand's Privacy Commissioner John Edwards, who criticized Facebook after last month's attacks on two mosques in Christchurch were live-streamed on Facebook.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
How much are social media companies to blame for the hate that spreads on their platforms? Last month's attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, were livestreamed on Facebook. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told ABC News last week his company needs to act faster to take down videos with violent, hateful content. In the case of New Zealand, he said Facebook took down more than a million copies of the video, but other versions kept cropping up. Here's Zuckerberg on ABC after the New Zealand shooting.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MARK ZUCKERBERG: One of the things that this flagged for me overall was the extent to which bad actors are going to try to get around our systems.
MARTIN: Our next guest says it's the systems that are the problem, not just the bad actors. One member of New Zealand's government is John Edwards. He is New Zealand's privacy commissioner, and he lambasted Facebook in a series of tweets, writing Facebook cannot be trusted. He joins us on the line this morning. Thank you so much for being with us.
JOHN EDWARDS: Good morning, Rachel.
MARTIN: You also wrote that Facebook is a group of, quote, ""morally bankrupt pathological liars."" Why?
EDWARDS: Yeah. Well, that is more extravagant language than I would normally use as an official and lifted out of its context promoting another interview that was a reaction to Mr. Zuckerberg's ABC interview. It certainly has got some cut through it. And so, you know, I mean, I don't regret using that language. We have a platform that has displayed shocking lack of responsibility and accountability for the tools that it has enabled. And I mentioned in the tweet, you know, there's the genocide in Myanmar, there's the corruption of the elections and undermining of democratic institutions elsewhere. It is really time for social media platforms to start taking more responsibility for the effects of their platforms.
MARTIN: So how would you like them to do it? Because we heard Mark Zuckerberg point out the lengths to which people would go to get around any tighter restrictions.
EDWARDS: Yeah, that was really interesting because he said - you know, he kind of conflated that with the livestreaming of the atrocity in New Zealand. But that person, you know, didn't go to any lengths. There were no systems. I mean, if you are going to offer a service that is capable of such deep and profound harm, then it is incumbent upon you to ensure that that's safe. In the U.S., you have product liability. If a manufacturer makes something - a product which causes harm, they are liable for that. You know, I think it's time we started looking to the social media companies for that. You know, to put this event in context for you, Rachel, as a proportion of our population that was affected, this is actually like to us what 9/11 was to the U.S.
MARTIN: So let's talk more about the change you'd like to see. Australia recently passed legislation where social media companies could face huge fines. Executives could get jail time if they don't pull down this type of material fast enough. Is that something you're looking at for New Zealand?
EDWARDS: Well, I don't get to make those decisions, but that will certainly make the companies sit up and take notice. I'm not sure about the practicalities of that. Certainly, in the U.K., we've also seen a legislative proposal introduced. We've seen the same in Singapore. But what prompted my tweets was the lack of responsibility that the company is taking. They should be acting now. I mean, if they can't assure us that that streaming service is safe, then it should be taken down. I was really quite - or a delay in search or something. I was quite disappointed when I heard Mr. Zuckerberg equate the atrocity in Christchurch with children's birthday parties. You know, he said if you put a delay in the system, it might have prevented the uploading of that video, but that would have broken the experience for the people who use it for children's parties.
I mean, I don't understand the mathematics there. You know, how many children's parties, Mr. Zuckerberg, equals one murder, one livestreamed suicide, one sexual assault livestreamed? You know, it's really incumbent, I think, on the platform to take some responsibility to make the product safe. And until they can to take it down - in the same way, for example, that we've seen Boeing 737 Max grounded because of a software fault, you can't fly them anywhere in the world. Here we have livestreaming as a software fault capable of causing great harm, and they've done nothing to change it since the 15 of March.
MARTIN: Do you believe they can find a balance? Or would you prefer that they just take the service down altogether?
EDWARDS: Well, I think that they have billions of dollars to invest on launching these products. It's incumbent on them to find the solution to launch it in a way that it can be safe. It's not incumbent on me to devise the solution for them. And, you know, they need to divert some of that investment. And maybe they need a cross industry agreement for all the other potential hosts to say, well, let's pause until we can do this safely.
MARTIN: Sharing the video, the activist taking it online and clicking and sharing it, is illegal in New Zealand because of censorship laws there. I understand you've asked Facebook to tell you who has shared the video. Have they responded to you?
EDWARDS: In the days following the shooting, I did make that comment. The scale, I think, is - has meant that that's impractical. But we do have at least one person facing charges in New Zealand for distributing that. And that's before the courts now.
MARTIN: Other social media companies like YouTube also had a role in spreading the video of the mosque killings. Are you holding them accountable, too?
EDWARDS: Well, I'm not really in a position to hold anyone to account because of the...
MARTIN: At least rhetorically.
EDWARDS: ...Attitude - yeah. Well, certainly. I mean, the thrust of my comments has been about the failure to address the immediate problem of that livestreaming service. Certainly, the subsequent distribution and the whack-a-mole and endless replication that makes that a practical impossibility is really difficult. But, you know, they also have to design solutions to that. But I think that they need to act immediately to assure us that a product that they're offering can't cause such harm again.
MARTIN: New Zealand Privacy Commissioner John Edwards, thank you so much for your time this morning. We appreciate it.
EDWARDS: Thank you.

Morning News Brief,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711693190/morning-news-brief,"Trump's immigration stance appears to be influenced by adviser Stephen Miller. Nearly all the votes are counted in Israel's parliamentary elections. EU leaders meet for a Brexit summit.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
There are more departures at the Department of Homeland Security. The second-in-command there, Claire Grady, offered her resignation last night. And she'll be leaving office today, the same day outgoing secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is departing.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Grady's exit paves the way for Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of the U.S. Borders - Customs and Border Protection Agency. He's going to take over as the Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary. This is all part of a shift by President Trump, who says he wants an even tougher approach to immigration. That shift appears to be heavily influenced by the president's senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller.
GREENE: And let's learn more about the man who seems to be behind a lot of the president's border policies inside the White House. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is here to talk about him.
Hi, Mara.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, David.
GREENE: So who is Stephen Miller?
LIASSON: Stephen Miller is a young White House aide who's been with Donald Trump since the beginning of the campaign. Before that, he worked for former attorney general Jeff Sessions in the Senate. And Miller has been an immigration restrictionist since long before Trump ran.
He has an interesting background. He grew up as a teenage conservative contrarian in liberal Santa Monica, Calif. And then he became a right-wing media star when he was a college student at Duke University.
But he got an opportunity with Trump. Now he's the strongest voice inside the White House on immigration. The president has tasked him with this, said he's in charge of immigration policy. He really knows his brief. He's also been one of the most fiercely loyal defenders of Donald Trump on television. And here he is in...
GREENE: Which Trump loves. I mean, that's very important to be in...
LIASSON: Yes, very important. Here he is in 2017 talking about the Muslim ban, which is the first big restrictionist immigration fight that the president picked.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
STEPHEN MILLER: Our opponents, the media and the whole world will soon see, as we begin to take further actions, that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.
LIASSON: So, yes, the president's powers on immigration are substantial. But they also have been questioned by other institutions, like Congress and the courts. And one of the reasons that Donald Trump was so frustrated with Kirstjen Nielsen was that, even though she didn't push back against his immigration goals, she would explain to him, on occasion, that some of what he wanted to do was probably unconstitutional. She was a reality check he didn't want.
But now, with the house cleaning at the Department of Homeland Security, Trump gets to remake the personnel in charge of immigration more in his own image. And Miller will be guiding that.
GREENE: OK. Well, if he's - I mean, he's remaking the personnel and, in theory, remaking the policy to make it tougher. But what exactly would that mean? What would it look like?
LIASSON: Some of the things that the president wants we know about. He wants a wall. He wants to stop the immigration lottery. He wants to stop chain migration. There's been some talk at the White House about creating an immigration czar.
The president has also talked about maybe stopping the asylum process altogether or closing the border, putting punitive tariffs on Mexico if they don't stop immigration. And what he wants to do is find deterrents to make it harder for asylum seekers to get in so that he can stop this surge at the border.
GREENE: That's something - I mean, the kinds of things you're talking about - even without Kristen Nielsen as the reality check, like you said, I mean, there's another reality check, which is Congress, right?
LIASSON: Right. And the president has been either unwilling or unable to make a deal with Congress. But White House officials believe that just changing some regulations at DHS, they could accomplish a lot. For instance, they'd like to toughen up the criteria for credible fear. They believe that immigration officials have a, quote, ""reflexive tendency to believe asylum seekers."" They want DHS to give fewer work permits to people in the asylum process. The White House believes, even without congressional action, that would make a big dent in the numbers of asylum seekers and asylum winners.
GREENE: OK. So some executive moves that the president could theoretically make here. That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks.
LIASSON: Thank you.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
GREENE: All right. Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting for his political survival after one of the closest-fought elections in Israeli history.
MARTIN: Yeah. Israelis went to the polls yesterday, cast their votes. Exit polls showed a race too close to call. Both Benjamin Netanyahu and his rival, Benny Gantz, declared victory at their respective rallies last night. The question now is who is better positioned to form a government?
GREENE: All right. Let's turn to NPR's Daniel Estrin, who is in Jerusalem. Hi, Daniel.
DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Good morning.
GREENE: So what is the latest here? I mean, does Benjamin Netanyahu have a clear path to victory here?
ESTRIN: It looks like Netanyahu has the best chances. Over 90 - over 97 percent of the votes have been counted, and it looks like the prime minister is set to extend his term. He and his centrist challenger, the retired general, Benny Gantz, were tied in the number of seats they won so far, as the votes have been counted.
But to become prime minister, you need to form a coalition of parties that adds up to a majority in parliament. And there is a clear majority, so far, of right-wing parties that won. And that would make it easiest for Netanyahu to form the government.
GREENE: What did this election feel like on the streets, I mean, as you were speaking with Israelis as they were voting yesterday?
ESTRIN: It was really interesting. I think, when I spoke to people voting for Gantz, the centrist, they seemed resigned to the fact that he didn't have a great chance of unseating Netanyahu. But they thought, well, if anyone had a chance to do it, he would. And here's what a left-wing voter, a 43-year-old woman named Yael Levine (ph), told me.
YAEL LEVINE: I have very little hope, but we have to have hope. We just have to hope that even center parties can move us forward.
ESTRIN: And the Netanyahu voters I met were actually very confident in him. And they said Israel's economy's doing really well. People are feeling secure here. And when I asked, well, what about the corruption allegations that Netanyahu faces? Well, listen to what Tzvi Gudin (ph), a 29-year-old voter, said.
TZVI GUDIN: Right now, everything is clear. For me, until there'll be a trial, there'll be a sentence, he's to me as clear as snow.
ESTRIN: So a lot of Netanyahu's voters said to me they didn't really care or they were skeptical about the allegations.
GREENE: What about the mood among Palestinians, at this moment, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip? What are they saying?
ESTRIN: Well, Palestinians in the Palestinian territories don't have the right to vote in Israeli elections. And Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said that the results look bad for the prospects of ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank. Here's what he said.
SAEB EREKAT: They want their occupation to be endless. And they want us to live under a continued, deeper apartheid system than the one that existed in the darkest hours of South Africa's apartheid.
ESTRIN: And actually, just days before elections, Netanyahu vowed to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank if he's re-elected. And that could make it impossible for Israel and the Palestinians to reach a peace deal.
GREENE: So, Daniel, assuming that Netanyahu remains in power - I mean, one of the voters you spoke to brought up, you know, until there is a trial, talking about these corruption allegations looming over him. Do those allegations pose a threat if he stays in power for now?
ESTRIN: They could, David. Within months, Netanyahu is likely to face an indictment. Once that happens, it could spell the beginning of the end for him. At least one of the parties expected to join a possible Netanyahu government may not stay by his side. And Netanyahu's own party could start preparing for the day after.
GREENE: All right. The latest on that very close Israeli election yesterday - NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem. Daniel, thanks.
ESTRIN: Sure thing.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
GREENE: Well, here's a headline - Brexit remains a total mess.
MARTIN: Yes, it does. Politicians in the United Kingdom still cannot agree on a way to leave the European Union, which is why the prime minister, Theresa May, is heading to Brussels today to ask the EU for yet another extension. This is before the clock runs out on Friday morning. Recently, she's been in Berlin. She has been in Paris trying to get support from German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron.
GREENE: And let's turn to our own Mr. Brexit - Frank Langfitt in London. Hi, Frank. You interested in...
FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey...
GREENE: ...Covering something else at some point (laughter)?
LANGFITT: At some point, but we'll have to see how tonight goes.
GREENE: Well, what exactly is the prime minister asking for this time?
LANGFITT: She - well, she wants a short extension to June 30. And the reason is just as you guys were mentioning - she needs more time to find some consensus in this country on how to leave the European Union. She's also under a lot of pressure from Brexiteers here to just get out as soon as possible. And the other thing is she wants to avoid having to seat U.K. members in the European parliament. The new parliament opens in early July. So that's what she's asking for.
GREENE: Well, what kind of response is she going to get from European Union leaders who, I mean, have been getting impatient for...
LANGFITT: Yeah. They're...
GREENE: ...Like, forever now.
LANGFITT: Exactly. Well, the EU is exasperated. But we are expecting that there will be some kind of extension. And that's because the EU, as we've said before, doesn't want the U.K. to crash out of this trading block with no arrangements or plans on Friday night.
Also, the EU, though, is going to want to hear some kind of plan on how to break this deadlock in the British parliament. Donald Tusk - he's the president of the European Council - he is suggesting a long extension, could be up to a year. And one of the reasons for that is he wants to avoid the U.K. just continuing to blow through these deadlines, which we've been talking about, and also, frankly, dominating the EU agenda.
Now, any kind of extension would probably have conditions, and one would be to keep the U.K. from disrupting the EU while it remains inside. There's a concern here that once the prime minister - Prime Minister May - leaves, a Brexiteer prime minister could come in and actually try to muck things up in the EU. So there are going to be probably some pretty tough conditions if there's any extension.
GREENE: Frank, can I ask you this? I mean, you have these EU leaders. And what we've heard is that no one wants to be that veto necessarily who forces...
LANGFITT: Oh, no. I don't think so.
GREENE: ...Britain out, I mean...
LANGFITT: No.
GREENE: ...And crash. But they all have to respond to their own voters as well. I mean, we know that Brexit's divided British society. What is the view from the European continent of all this?
LANGFITT: It's really interesting, David. I was in Copenhagen over the weekend, and I was talking to Danish friends. And the response that I got was people cannot believe the bitterness, the anger, the chaos that they've seen in the parliament here that many in Europe really admired for a long time. Another pointed out that the U.K. is Denmark's closest ally, and he just feels really sad about it.
Interestingly, the chaos of Brexit has actually helped the EU's image on the continent. I was speaking last week to George Papaconstantinou. He's the former finance minister for Greece. And this is what he said.
GEORGE PAPACONSTANTINOU: Brexit has made Europeans realize more clearly what they have. It has made people realize that peace, prosperity and a common destiny that we've all been taking for granted for such a long time is something brittle that, if you don't protect and nurture, you could lose.
GREENE: Wow. That's quite reflective about this moment. What an interesting view to hear.
LANGFITT: It is. And I think that, really, in some ways, in the short run, Brexit has actually been good for the EU.
GREENE: Tonight in Brussels, another big decision on the U.K.'s long and - can we say - tortured path out of the EU. And NPR's Frank Langfitt in London will be covering it. Frank, thank you.
LANGFITT: Happy to do it, David.

"Beyond The Summer Of Love, 'Get Together' Is An Anthem For Every Season",www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711545679/get-together-youngbloods-summer-of-love-american-anthem,"Enlarge this image The Youngbloods circa 1967. Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images hide caption
toggle caption Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images The Youngbloods circa 1967.
Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images This story is part of American Anthem, a yearlong series on songs that rouse, unite, celebrate and call to action. Find more at NPR.org/Anthem .
The song sometimes called the ""hippie national anthem"" can be found in all kinds of places. It's been used on The Simpsons and in Forrest Gump, recorded dozens of times by the likes of The Kingston Trio, The Dave Clark Five, Jefferson Airplane, The Staples Singers and the Carpenters (twice). You may have even heard it in a Walmart commercial a few years ago.
The song has gone by a few different names: ""Let's Get Together,"" Everybody Get Together."" But the best-known version is called, simply, "" Get Together ."" It was recorded by The Youngbloods in 1967 — the same year as the Summer of Love, where it would become a constant presence.
YouTube In 1967, the Vietnam War was raging. The Youngbloods' lead singer, Jesse Colin Young, remembers, ""Back then we were all subject to the draft. That made everything more life and death. And hope is what comes out of that song.""
Young was a folk singer and guitarist with two albums under his belt when he met guitarist Jerry Corbitt on the folk scene in Cambridge, Mass. They put The Youngbloods together in New York City with drummer Joe Bauer and multi-instrumentalist Lowell Levinger, known as Banana. The band rehearsed in Greenwich Village's Café au Go Go when there wasn't a show happening, and that's where Young first heard ""Get Together.""
""It was a Sunday afternoon and I was walking through the Village and thought, 'Oh, the Go Go's gonna be dark. I'll call the band; we can rehearse,' "" Young recalls. ""I walked down the stairs and it turned out to be an open mic. I thought I would turn around and go home. But Buzzy Linhart was onstage singing 'Get Together.' That song just stopped me in my tracks.""
Young says it was the lyrics that really grabbed him. "" ' Love is but a song we sing / Fear's the way we die .' Wow — the human condition in two lines.""
The lyrics grabbed Lizz Wright , too: The jazz and gospel singer recorded ""Get Together"" in 2004 for her album Dreaming Wide Awake . She's a fan of one verse in particular:
If you hear the song I sing
You will understand
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
Just one key unlocks them both
It's there at your command
""It's so clear, and the imagery is fantastic,"" Wright says. ""In our uncertainty, in our not fully knowing, we are still holding so much power and choosing to learn by love or to learn by fear as we go. And I just love how this verse puts it back in our in our court as individuals.""
YouTube The song was written in the early 1960s by Chester Powers, who performed under the name Dino Valenti. The son of carnival performers, he made a name for himself in the folk clubs of Greenwich Village. Though he had already left for the West Coast when The Youngbloods formed, Young did meet him years later.
""I met him at a motorcycle shop in Marin County — we were both living in the Bay Area,"" Young says. ""I was surprised Dino was kind of a tough guy. I thought to myself, 'Wow, the angels just took a hold of you one day and put this song in your head, and you brought it to us.' ""
David Freiberg of Jefferson Starship puts the song's origin around 1964. He was in Los Angeles visiting a friend, ""and in pops Dino Valenti driving in like a crazy [man] and says, 'Hey man, listen to this song I just wrote!' "" Freiberg recalls. ""And we listened to it and went, 'Oh my goodness! How great that song is.' And we're quickly writing down the lyrics to it.""
He also remembers hearing Valenti perform for the first time. ""He stomped his foot so hard on the stage it was like there were drums playing with him,"" he says. ""A lot of energy, very fiery kind of guy, but he was so talented."" Freiberg eventually got to know Valenti well when they played together in Quicksilver Messenger Service.
When the Youngbloods' version of Valenti's song came out, it became part of the soundtrack for the Summer of Love in San Francisco, making Valenti something of a local celebrity. But when he got busted for drug possession, he had to sell the rights to ""Get Together"" to pay for a lawyer and avoid a possible 10-year prison sentence, according to music journalist Ben Fong-Torres .
""As he famously said,"" Fong-Torres recalls, "" 'For 10 years of my life? Man, I can write another song.' "" Valenti did eventually recover the rights later in life, before his death in 1994.
Valenti's most famous song went on to have a life of its own. Though it didn't get much national attention in 1967, two years later The Youngbloods' version was used in a public service announcement for the National Conference of Christians and Jews . People started calling their radio stations requesting the song. Young remembers what happened next.
""Augie Blum, the head of promotion at RCA, went to his boss and said, 'I want this song again. Now's the time for it.' And they told him, 'Now Augie, we don't do that. You know we released it once. That's it.' And he said, 'You release a song again or I'm out of here.' He was too valuable for them to lose,"" Young explains. ""So they put it out again, and he was right, of course. The country was ready.""
American Anthem A Thousand People In The Street: 'For What It's Worth' Captured Youth In Revolt American Anthem Greatness Is Not A Given: 'America The Beautiful' Asks How We Can Do Better The Youngbloods' version of ""Get Together"" went to No. 5 on Billboard 's Hot 100 chart. Fong-Torres says it captured the zeitgeist of the time, albeit in a roundabout way: ""It took a band from New York City to give San Francisco and the Haight-Ashbury generation its anthem.""
One meaning of the word ""anthem"" is a psalm or hymn. ""Get Together"" definitely carries that message for Young, who was a born-again Christian in his teens.
""I think Dino must have had some church upbringing, because he's talking about, 'Some may come and some may go. We will surely pass.' This is very Eastern philosophy, and new to some of us at that point,"" Young says. "" 'When the one that left us here returns for us at last / We are just a moment's sunlight fading in the grass.' Wow.""
Freiberg, however, points out a word change: ""The Youngbloods' version says, 'When the one that left us here returns for us at last.' Dino said the lyric was supposed to be, 'When the wind that left us here.' I like that best 'cause it symbolizes the cosmic wind and the interconnection of everything."" He adds, ""But then, I'm a Buddhist.""
An early review of the song even asked why it's not sung in church. Wright thinks it should be. ""There was just all this imagery, some of it even edging on biblical imagery,"" Wright says. ""I just felt like this is one of those songs that helped me speak better, speak everything else better. And when I first heard it, I knew that it would make me better as a messenger.""
And Young says it still carries a message — for our times.
""Every night I sing it, it's my favorite part of the show because the people sing,"" he says. ""I played it in Central Park this past summer, and that was on the first anniversary of Charlottesville. Those people sang it stronger than I've ever heard it sung. Some people were pumping their fists, and I realized they were saying, 'We choose love.' ""

Karine Polwart Trio: Tiny Desk Concert,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711244527/karine-polwart-trio-tiny-desk-concert,"Scottish singer, songwriter and essayist Karine Polwart seldom comes stateside. She prefers to limit air travel in order to minimize her carbon footprint. She took exception, however, to fly from Edinburgh to New York City to participate in the Carnegie Hall Migrations festival, a celebration of the history of the movement of people all around the world. Polwart and her brother, guitarist Steven Polwart and multi-instrumentalist, Inge Thomson, then escaped New York for a day to play the Tiny Desk here in Washington, D.C.
Polwart writes songs about hope, music that harnesses spiritual power and lyrics that address important social justice themes. Stories of human emotion and the human experience are also commonplace as in the first tune, ""Ophelia.""
""There's a wind in from the desert
Red dust blows across the sun
It bleeds into the evening
We watch it from the garden
Your hair glints in the strange yellow light
We let go of all our fighting
Ophelia""
Her second song at the desk, ""I Burn But I Am Not Consumed,"" includes a mesmerizing spoken word denunciation of President Donald Trump, while the closing tune, ""King of Birds,"" praises the power of small things. In it Polwart recounts the legend of a wren who piggybacks a lift on an eagle's wing. Just as the large bird is unable to fly any higher in the sky, the tiny wren catches a breath of air, soars higher than the eagle and is crowned the king of all birds.
""At Ludgate Hill
where the towers of smoke and mirrors bruise the sky
the pilgrims huddle in
as the tiny King of Birds begins to cry
the people start to sing
to light glory in the dark
to ring the bell
and to breathe hope in every heart""
Lyricism and messages of hope and beauty heard throughout punctuate a stunning accompaniment of inventive instrumentation. The steady, resonant guitar riffs played by Steven Polwart ground the delicate vocal harmonies. Inge Thomson's accordion lines, combined with an array of percussion instruments and synth-generated effects, add a complimentary layer of sound without overpowering the music. Karine Polwart's bellowing and drone-like Shruti box provides a sweet serenity.
This performance will quite likely inspire you to learn more about Polwart. The NPR program, The Thistle and Shamrock often features her music. This recent episode features cuts from Polwart's latest album, plus her ideas on movement and migration.

Amazon Independent Booksellers TERRY GROSS, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Congress in the Trump era is the subject of the new book by my guests Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer. It's called ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America."" Sherman and Palmer are senior writers for Politico and co-write the twice-a-day newsletter Politico Playbook.
Their new book covers Capitol Hill, when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress as well as the White House, and describes how the power dynamic changed after Democrats took control of the House last year and Nancy Pelosi reclaimed her position as speaker. One thing that Democrats and Republicans in Congress have in common during this divisive period is that they're both dealing with a president who is unpredictable and doesn't follow protocol when it comes to dealing with Congress.
Jake Sherman, Anna Palmer, welcome to FRESH AIR. So we're supposed to be a government of checks and balances. The Congress voted against giving President Trump the money he requested for the wall, so the president declared a national emergency to build the wall and plans on getting the money from other parts of the budget. And Republicans who voted against funding for Trump's wall seem to be willingly ceding their power to the president - ceding their power as being, like, a check against the president. Tell us why you think that's happening.
JAKE SHERMAN: I think it's kind of the most recent example of a long string of Congress giving its power away to the presidency, to be honest with you. We've seen this in various fashions over the last 10 years. Congress has given away some of its power of spending and things of that nature. But this truly is new.
And the fear from the people that we talk to every day on Capitol Hill is that the next president will come in and say something else is an emergency. And if they can't get it from Congress, they'll also declare an emergency and try to get money from other places in the budget. So I think, more than anything, this specifically is a very dangerous precedent to set.
GROSS: Do you think that Republicans in Congress are afraid of President Trump and afraid to stand up to him?
ANNA PALMER: I don't think they're afraid. But I do think there is a concern about going up against the president on key issues like immigration and the border, for example, and what that impact might have on their re-election. One of the things that, you know, you find when you're talking to these members every single day is how obsessed they are with their next election and their popularity. And the president is very popular with the Republican base. And he has shown no compunction to do anything but go after Republicans who aren't in line with what he thinks.
GROSS: So Republicans have traditionally been against massive federal spending and against deficits. But right now, I mean, the tax bill that Republicans passed has greatly added to the deficit. Spending for the wall that the president wants - I mean, that's a hugely expensive bill. And it's another issue where Republicans don't seem to be standing up to Trump on that. Have Republicans changed in their attitude toward spending as the party has gotten further to the right? Have the priorities shifted?
PALMER: Yeah. I mean, I think it's actually pretty stunning. When Jake and I have been covering Capitol Hill Republicans in power for years, the orthodoxy was, spend less, cut spending. And Donald Trump came in and really doesn't care about any of that. And so one of the kind of interesting things that we discuss in the book - and talking to members who were his key allies, whether that's Mark Meadows of North Carolina or Jim Jordan of Ohio - that kind of cutting spending and government waste is - was how they came into office.
They, you know, are willing to let the president spend and do what he wants to on those things. But then there are issues such as immigration or the border wall where they really want to make sure and try to pressure the president to hold fast to where they are on those issues.
GROSS: It seems so paradoxical that for the first couple of years of the Trump presidency, Paul Ryan was the speaker of the House. And he was, like, the deficit hawk. I mean, that was - there were so many programs he wanted to cut. That was his thing.
SHERMAN: It was. And this is something that history will have to reckon with in a way that we are not able to at this moment or we're only beginning to be able to at this moment. But Paul Ryan's orthodoxy - his entire intellectual makeup and his entire partisan makeup - has completely shifted. As you noted, he was a spending hawk, a deficit hawk, who spent the first 15 or 20 years of his congressional career railing against the - a bloated bureaucracy and a bloated federal government.
And he - Donald Trump - got into office. And in a sense, Paul Ryan, I believe, felt like he had lost the argument - that he presented one view of America, which he believed for - between 1999 and 2016. He was on the presidential ticket in 2012. And then Donald Trump got elected, presenting another, completely different view of the Republican Party in America. And Donald Trump won the presidency.
So I think Paul Ryan felt, at that moment, that he had a decision to make. Either he would have to retire, leave Congress, when Donald Trump got elected, or stick around and try - in his words and his thinking - to keep the government on the rails, to keep things from going too crazy. And that was his thinking as he got into Donald Trump's presidency.
Now, a lot of people will say, Republicans only cared about deficit spending when Barack Obama was in office. And Donald Trump got in there, and they didn't care anymore. And there's some truth to that. And there's some truth to Ryan completely changing his tune on all of these things. And that's something we get into a lot.
GROSS: Well, you write about how one of the reasons why Ryan wanted to stay in the House - 'cause he was conflicted about staying or going. He wanted to set an example that there could be, like - I think he used the word a normal person in Congress in the party.
PALMER: I think Paul Ryan, and I certainly think Mitch McConnell, who leads the Senate Republicans, feel like they are kind of the guardrails of this presidency in terms of making sure that things don't go totally haywire. And so I think Paul Ryan - this - Donald Trump offends him in so many ways in what he personally believes, how the president tweets, how he, you know, is crass in some ways. That is not the kind of person that Paul Ryan believes he is himself or how he comports himself to be. But I think he felt a real responsibility to try and make sure that things didn't go completely off the rails.
GROSS: But then he decided to leave.
SHERMAN: He did. And in his telling publicly, it was because he has a young family. His father and grandfather both died young. And he's getting to the age where they passed away. And he had a sense of time in the sense that he thought, in his head, that he was lucky. He was living on borrowed time, in a sense. And he wasn't sure how much time he would have left, although he's a very physically fit guy and shows no sign of slowing down.
But I mean, you do get the sense - and we all got the sense from covering this every day for the last two years - that Paul Ryan did get sick of Donald Trump. And there were several episodes throughout the last two years where Paul Ryan got in massive, blow-up arguments behind the scenes with the president over immigration law, over spending, over just his behavior.
There's an episode where he says - he - the president said he wanted to do away with the 14th Amendment, which allows birthright citizenship. And Paul Ryan went on the radio and said, he can't do that. And then the president called him, screaming. And that's kind of a good encapsulation of their relationship. And President Trump, by the way, who we interviewed, said he - basically said he didn't really care that much for Ryan in the end. He said, he really abandoned me a few times.
PALMER: Foxhole Paul.
SHERMAN: He called him Foxhole Paul, which is his way of saying he wasn't in the foxhole with the president. Paul Ryan wasn't in the foxhole with the president. So it was a complicated relationship between two men who really did not care for each other but felt like they had to work with each other to keep the government open and to keep some things on the rails. Although, many would argue that things did go off the rails on many occasions.
GROSS: Now, I want to ask you about Lindsey Graham. He heads the Senate Judiciary Committee. And after the House voted unanimously to release the full Mueller report, Lindsey Graham decided not to even bring that up to the Judiciary Committee. And Graham's been demanding that the Democrats also vote on appointing a special counsel to look into alleged Department of Justice misconduct on the investigations into President Trump and into Hillary Clinton.
Lindsey Graham used to be so close to John McCain - to Senator McCain. And President Trump seems to have missed no opportunity to insult John McCain. He insulted him during the campaign. He insulted him when he came to office. He insulted John McCain after John McCain died. And Lindsey Graham has become very close and very politically aligned to President Trump. Do you have any insights into what happened to Lindsey Graham between the time when he was, you know, the closest of allies with John McCain and now, when he's so close to the person who has maligned John McCain?
PALMER: I think it's important to note that Senator Graham most recently did speak back home and said that what the president was - his most recent criticism of John McCain was not appropriate. And he really did push back on that. But I do think what you have to realize is, yes, John McCain and Lindsey Graham were close, personal friends. Lindsey Graham also tried to do a massive immigration deal. He has - he's up for re-election. And as I said earlier, what you really realize when you're on Capitol Hill every day is that when members are up for re-election, they are constantly looking at the numbers there. And it's a political calculus.
I think he has decided that, you know, they - he doesn't believe that the Mueller report needs to be released. He wants to go - he has aligned himself with the president in a lot of ways. He's personally golfed with him many times. Being close to the president is politically advantageous to Lindsey Graham at this point.
SHERMAN: I would say one more thing on top of that. I think that writing this book has made - has sharpened this point in my mind - that politicians really exist in a political moment, meaning they act the way they do because of the political dynamics at one moment. And number two, politicians are there to gain power, keep power and increase power. And however they might do that, they'll do it.
And in this situation, Lindsey Graham basically said back home - Anna alluded to this - what the president said about John McCain wasn't right. But the voters of South Carolina put me in office to get things done and to work with this president, and I'm going to do that - basically saying, I understand that he's critical of my very close - former very close friend John McCain. I don't appreciate that. But I also have something else I need to do, which is to work with Donald Trump to achieve the policies I'm looking to achieve. And he's pretty brash about that. And he's pretty honest about it, even though, to everybody else - and many people we talked to - they find it to be intellectually dishonest. But that's the way he views it.
GROSS: What are Republicans looking to right now to see if the winds are shifting against Trump? - because if they're aligning with Trump because they think it's going to help them with re-election, then they need Trump's support. But if Trump is losing support, then it would hurt them to be aligned with Trump when the next election comes around. So how are they testing the winds on that? - because it's always - it always seems to be questionable if there's going to be a point at which the wind shifts.
SHERMAN: You saw this recently. The president said he wanted to do health care reform. And Republicans said, no, thanks. We lost the House of Representatives because we got into a prolonged fight over health care reform, a policy that Republicans do not have their arms around in a real, big way. And I think you saw them back off on that. And you see them back off on several other fronts, too. I think they're trying to put distance between themselves and the president where it's useful.
But, especially in the House of Representatives, many Republicans now hold seats that are overwhelmingly supportive of Donald Trump. The Republican Party on Capitol Hill now is Trump's party. And their fortunes - some - many members tell us, when they go home, they couldn't be close enough to the president. That's the political dynamic at this point. That's what the political map looks like at this point. They couldn't be close enough and tied closely enough to this president. And his - their fortunes are tied together. But in many of their districts, the president's still incredibly popular.
GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more about what's happening in Congress now.
If you're just joining us, my guests are Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer. They co-write Politico's Playbook, and now they have a new book-book - (laughter) - which is called ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America."" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF LOUIS SCLAVIS' ""FETE FORAINE"")
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guests are Anna Palmer and Jake Sherman. And they co-write Politico's Playbook. And they also have a new book that they've co-written called ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America.""
Let's look at some divisions within the Democratic Party now between the mainstream of the party and the newer, more left members in the House, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And so there's questions now about whether to push for Medicare for All or make incremental changes in Obamacare, whether to go for the Green New Deal or more incremental environmental change. Give us a sense of the dynamic now in the House among Democrats, between the more left-leaning, new members - who are also largely, you know, younger - and the more veteran members, those who are more mainstream.
SHERMAN: Yeah. The center of gravity in the House of Representatives among Democrats is Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker. And that's the - kind of an eternal truism about Democratic politics. Nancy Pelosi has been the leader of House Democrats now for a very long time and is probably as powerful as ever. And if you ask Nancy Pelosi about the Green New Deal or Medicare for All or any of these positions that some of the younger members are advocating for, she kind of deals with them in her own way by saying, I'm as progressive as they come, but I'm also about getting an outcome. I'm about solutions that can pass the House of Representatives and have a chance of, some point, getting into law. And she's spoken very dismissively about the Green New Deal and about Medicare For All and says we actually have a good health care system, called Obamacare, and we should improve and strengthen that. And she talks about the Green New Deal as the green new dream. She knows the name, obviously, and she knows what's in it. But she's dismissive of it, in a sense, and says she has her own solutions that she's been working on for many years.
And I think there's some of the older guard. The Democrats that have been in the House of Representatives for a decade or more feel like they've been working on these issues for a very long time, and in come a new crop of freshmen and they're taking all the credit for it. And I think there's some tension there. But there's no question that the younger Democrats, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and some of her allies in the House of Representatives, have brought an energy to the House that we really haven't seen in a long time, especially on the left. I mean, we saw a little bit in 2010 with Republicans, but - definitely have brought a new energy and a new vigor to a House Democratic Caucus that was increasingly old.
GROSS: How are divisions among Democrats effecting the tactics that they're using to move forward with opposition to the president? Are they divided on those tactics?
SHERMAN: Minorly, but not really in a major way. I'd say the one thing Democrats are completely on the same page on is going after President Trump with all the weapons and all the tools they have. Now, there is a small clutch of Democrats at the moment who believe that the party should immediately move to impeach the president. That's still a very small minority in the House of Representatives among Democrats. But I think that they have largely stuck together when it comes to demanding the president's tax returns, issuing subpoenas for bank records going back several decades from the president's businesses, things of that nature. I don't think you see much divide there, and I don't think you will, going forward.
But in a way, Democrats are helped by President Trump in that there's not much that could get the president's signature. They're not going to pass many bills into law. So they only really have to stick together on these big investigatory committees, on these big oversight issues, which is not difficult with a president who probably polls in the low teens, if that, with the Democratic base.
GROSS: President Trump - you write that President Trump wanted Nancy Pelosi to be speaker after the Democrats won the House and that his plan was to ask the Freedom Caucus - the most conservative members of Congress, who are also his allies - to vote for her. And Trump told you that he thought the most conservative members of Congress would do him a favor and vote for Nancy Pelosi as House speaker. Tell us more about that. That's an interesting and surprising story.
SHERMAN: I do think that there is some dynamic between Pelosi and Trump that's hard to capture and hard to explain. It seems like, from our experience both talking to the president and watching him publicly, he does seem almost taken by Pelosi, taken by her power, taken by her ability to corral Democrats together to keep them on the same page. And he lamented to us in the book that Democrats stick together much better than Republicans do, and that's something that he was very upset about and very regretful that Republicans couldn't stick together. He doesn't appreciate Democrats' policies, he says, but he appreciates their unity, which was an interesting insight into the president's head.
But also, furthermore, I do think that the president likes cutting deals with Democrats periodically. I think he likes the Hollywood flair, in his mind, and the ratings - again, in his telling - of doing business with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer - by the way, two people that he's known for a very long time. So it's a very interesting relationship, and I think we'll see more in the months ahead between the Democratic speaker, who, by the way, President Trump was a donor to and was very, very, very praising of when he was a developer in New York.
GROSS: Wait - to Schumer, not to Pelosi, right?
SHERMAN: To both of them.
GROSS: To both of them.
SHERMAN: Yes, he wrote the - he wrote Pelosi a note when she became speaker in 2006 saying how great she was and how much he respected her. Again, I'm paraphrasing the president's words, but he sent her a note very praising of her abilities when she became speaker in 2006, 2007.
GROSS: My guests are Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer, senior writers for Politico who co-write the newsletter Politico Playbook. Their new book is called ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America."" We'll talk more after a break. And Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel by Sally Rooney that was named the Irish novel of the year. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF ALLISON MILLER'S BOOM TIC BOOM'S ""WELCOME HOTEL"")
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview about Congress in the Trump era. My guests are Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer. They're senior writers for Politico and co-write the twice-a-day newsletter Politico Playbook. Their new book is titled ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America.""
Let's talk about the role of the Freedom Caucus. You write about the Freedom Caucus a lot in your book. And I should say the Freedom Caucus is basically a far-right Republican caucus within the House. And their role has obviously changed from when the House was run by Republicans to now, when it's run by Democrats. But tell us how they were first created.
SHERMAN: The Freedom Caucus came to be during John Boehner's speakership, and it was started by Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows - Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mark Meadows of North Carolina. And they wanted a small group of people who would be able to stand up against their own party when they thought their party went astray. And I visited Jim Jordan at his home in Ohio in reporting this book and talked to him about this. And he compares it to a union because in the House of Representatives, you don't have power as a single member of Congress. You have power if you band together and starve the speaker of the House of the ability to move legislation. And they were able to do that on almost every issue - tax reform, health care reform, spending, immigration. They were able to hold the party's feet to the fire, hold Donald Trump's feet to the fire and drag every piece of legislation to the right.
And they found a kindred spirit, in a sense, in Donald Trump, who was elected, obviously, in 2016. They had been planning to try to oust Paul Ryan if Hillary Clinton was elected president. Instead, they found themselves with a ideological ally in the White House or someone they thought could be an ideological ally. And they have - and it's no overstatement to say they have really shaped the Republican Party in that image and shaped, in a small way, America the - some policies that got enacted into law in Donald Trump's presidency in their image over the last couple years.
GROSS: What are the tactics that they used during Republican control of the House to block legislation they didn't like and to move legislation further to the right?
PALMER: Yeah, I mean, they oftentimes - a lot of it's behind the scenes - right? - so it's not just going to the House floor. But it would be starving John Boehner first and then Paul Ryan of the necessary votes to get bills passed. They would - you know, in the book, we detail how both Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan went to the floor and, you know, kind of would give speeches that then would get played on Fox News that then the president would see. And so you see their impact kind of all along the way.
And I would also say they also had - they - particularly Mark Meadows has a very good relationship with the president. And he was brought in on tax reform kind of surprisingly after he and Jim Jordan wrote a letter saying these were the kind of, you know, four or five things that needed to be in tax reform for their support. And not only did the president read it, but then the president wanted to make sure that he kept those guys happy.
SHERMAN: One other tactic is they took unrelated bills hostage. They were looking for certain policies on immigration reform, so instead, they starved Republicans of the votes they needed to pass an agricultural policy bill. So they would take completely unrelated issues hostage to get what they want on issues that Donald Trump cared about, like immigration reform, immigration overhaul, restrictive immigration policies.
So they were really bending the legislative process to their will and angering a lot of people, but they saw Paul Ryan and the House Republican leadership as not representative of what Donald Trump got elected to do. They thought Donald Trump got elected on a very simple platform, which was building a wall on the border with Mexico and very restrictive immigration policies. And it was - in their view, they needed to do everything they could do to help the president achieve those ends, which, at times, included blocking unrelated pieces of legislation to make a point and to achieve an end.
GROSS: Did the Freedom Caucus have just enough people to block legislation?
SHERMAN: Yes, they had a little bit more than the margin that Republicans had over Democrats, which allowed them - basically gave them veto power over anything that Paul Ryan wanted to do. So if they stuck together, they were the most powerful 20 people in America or 30 people, depending on who their allies were on that specific issue, which is amazing. We had never seen power exercised like this in the modern House of Representatives.
PALMER: I don't think you can underscore how frustrating it was to Republican leadership that this kind of band of ragtag Republicans that typically would never have been taken seriously would've, you know, given rousing speeches on the House floor, but would never have been able to control the agenda how big of an impact that made.
GROSS: Now, you write Jim Jordan of the Freedom Caucus craves confrontation. Give us an example of a confrontation that he initiated.
SHERMAN: Well, he was the mastermind behind the December government shutdown, which we know now was the longest government shutdown in American history - lasted more than a month and impacted Americans who work for the federal government to a degree that we're only beginning to realize. He went to the White House and pushed Donald Trump to shut down the government if he did not get money for his border wall. He thought - in his mind, Jim Jordan - some of his allies thought - in crises - in big legislative crises like a government shutdown, people's incentive structures in people's minds would be scrambled, in a sense, and they would make decisions that were irrational, which is an interesting way to think about governing. He thought if you put people against a wall, they might abandon their ideology.
He thought Nancy Pelosi - there was no way Nancy Pelosi could stand up for not having a wall on the border with Mexico. And he put that theory to a test and pushed Donald Trump into a government shutdown. So those were the kinds of things he did to try to achieve ends for Donald Trump. And I think the president realizes now that those tactics are not necessarily successful, not necessarily good strategy, but that's what Jim Jordan tried to do. He put the government in crisis and believed that he would be able to achieve an end out of that.
GROSS: Let's talk about Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. And you write, you know, with Congress often in gridlock, the judiciary has become more important. And McConnell's goal is to reshape the federal judiciary. How long has that been his goal?
PALMER: Really, when you look at the Republicans and conservatives writ large across the country, the judiciary and the importance of the judiciary has been something that they have been talking about for years. It's something that wins elections for them. It's something that really energizes their base - you know, getting the Supreme Court to be more conservative. And what you've seen this Congress and even before is that Mitch McConnell - his single focus, more than anything else, has been to try to push through more judges that are conservative and - particularly in the Trump administration, they are younger. They are conservative. They are going to be on the bench for a very long time.
GROSS: So he has changed some of the rules in order to push through very conservative judges. So what are some of the rules he's changed?
SHERMAN: Well, I think it's most important to note the kind of unwritten rule that he changed back in Obama's years. President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland to be a Supreme Court justice when Scalia passed away. And Mitch McConnell, at that moment - that day, he was on vacation with his wife in the islands. And the moment Scalia, who he knew very well - the moment he died, McConnell took a pen out and wrote a statement, sent it to his office, saying, Merrick Garland will not be given a hearing. The next president will choose the next Supreme Court justice - which, by the way, was a massive gamble for McConnell because Hillary Clinton was ahead in the polls. Donald Trump, who McConnell likes to remind people was donating money to Chuck Schumer just a few years ago - Republicans weren't confident about how Donald Trump would view the judiciary, so it was a huge gamble. But McConnell - that was McConnell's goal, to not get Merrick Garland a hearing and not give him a vote on the floor. And he achieved that. And from that, he got Neil Gorsuch. And later, he got Kavanaugh. But that's right. I mean, McConnell has fast-tracked the procedures to get nominees to the floor and has done so with stunning success and has gotten dozens of judges on to federal courts across the country. And Congresses come and go, and people don't always remember that. The House flips all the time. The Senate flips all the time. Judges have lifetime appointments, and that's incredibly important to remember when thinking about Mitch McConnell and his long-term goals.
GROSS: One of the things that McConnell recently did was to cut the debate time from 30 hours to two hours for judicial and administrative nominees. What's the significance of that?
SHERMAN: The Senate has very arcane rules, to say the least. And it just basically, in layman's terms, allows him to move judges - more judges in a short period of time. Remember; the Senate is home probably one out of every four weeks. So instead of taking several days to move judges, he can move several judges in one day. And that's incredibly, incredibly important because the Judiciary Committee in the Senate can move judges out of their committee quite quickly. But there was this threshold that forced a slowdown in that process, and McConnell has completely removed that stumbling block. And McConnell's critics will say, well, this might not benefit you when you're in the minority. But McConnell's retort is that Democrats are blocking, and they're forcing Republicans to use up all of those 30 hours. And that's preventing the president from getting the judges he wants. And that's, obviously, a very big priority of the president, which McConnell is helping him out with.
GROSS: Do you think McConnell is also thinking, by the time the Democrats have a majority, there will be so many conservative judges who have been appointed, it won't matter that much?
PALMER: Sure. I mean, I think he's making a gamble to say, I'm going to stack the judiciary as far as he can according to Democrats' perspective. And, you know, he's going to continue that mission. When we sat down with him - I think a lot of people wonder what motivates Mitch McConnell because he's a man of few words. He doesn't get fiery. He rarely, you know, kind of does long speeches or different things like that. He's been in politics for a long time. But the one thing that is clear is he sees his legacy as the federal judiciary.
GROSS: Let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guests are Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer. They wrote the new book ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America."" They cover Congress for Politico where they write The Playbook, which is a twice-a-day newsletter about what's going on on the Hill. We'll be right back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF CUONG VU & PAT METHENY'S ""SEEDS OF DOUBT"")
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guests are Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer, who cover Congress for Politico. They write the daily newsletter the Playbook. And they also have a new book they've co-authored called ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America.""
How have you seen Congress change in the years that you've been covering it? And that's since 2009 and 2011 to the year or...
SHERMAN: Yeah, that's right.
PALMER: You know, I mean, I've covered Congress...
SHERMAN: Yeah.
PALMER: ...Since 2004.
SHERMAN: OK, sorry.
GROSS: Oh, OK.
PALMER: I'm older. But we've been at Politico since 2009 and 2011.
SHERMAN: We've been covering it together since 2009.
PALMER: Yes. Yes, sorry.
GROSS: OK. OK. So what are some of the ways you've seen Congress change in that time?
PALMER: I definitely think that it has only become more partisan. I think that the way elections start - the day after a member is elected, they're raising money. They're trying to go back to their districts. There's not a lot of community and bipartisanship in a sense of Republicans and Democrats getting to know each other as humans, as people. And I think that's to the detriment of, you know, the institution in the sense that you don't give your colleague on the other side of the aisle the benefit of the doubt that they're coming from a good place. I do think the amount of money in politics has also increased tremendously in my time covering Washington. And the amount of dark money and 527's after Citizens United has had a huge impact on the overall tenor of things as well.
SHERMAN: And I think Anna's right on the money front. I mean, individual House races - races that are conducted with electorates of five-, 600,000 people are costing tens of millions of dollars, which is just astronomical. People were raising several hundred thousand dollars in the past. Now they have to raise three-, $4 million for competitive races. And I think everything has become politicized. I mean, starting in 2009, Republicans made a calculated choice to - in the worst financial crisis in a very long time - to allow President Obama to pass legislation on his own without their help. It was a political decision, but it really set the tone for the last decade of legislating. And I'm not sure Republicans realized that at the time, but their decision to really oppose Barack Obama at every turn set the tone for just a really partisan phase in our politics.
GROSS: Now that the Democrats control the House, it seems the people who really watch right now include the heads of some of the committees, like the House Intelligence Committee, Ways and Means, judiciary - the committees that are really investigating President Trump and continuing to investigate Russian interference in the election. So how are you covering them? You know, like Adam Schiff, Jerrold Nadler - they hold a lot of power now, and what they're trying to do could prove to be very significant.
PALMER: I think we cover them like we always have. I think one of the great things about being a reporter on Capitol Hill that is unlike any other institution is the amount of access that you have to these members. You can follow them in the hallways. You can wait for them after votes. They regularly talk to - both Republicans and Democrats talk to reporters. And so I think that now that they're in power, we cover them because they get to make some of the key decisions about whether these investigations happen and how they happen.
SHERMAN: And also they're sending letters every day. I mean, they're really pressuring the administration. But we also - it's important to keep in mind that everything flows through Nancy Pelosi. She sets the tenor and tone of all these investigations, and it's important to listen to every one of her utterances on every topic to really know what the Democrats are going to do when it comes to investigations.
And I will say, within the Democratic Party, there is some nervousness about looking overzealous. I think that's something that we'll begin to see in the next couple months is Democrats wanting to make sure they proceed with caution because while holding Trump accountable is very important both substantively and in the polls - it polls very well - there is concern of overreach and going too far too quickly too much. There's a lot of committees looking into the president, and it's the Democratic leadership's job to keep it streamlined, to keep everybody in line.
GROSS: I want you to tell a couple of stories about Jared Kushner that you learned that show the ability he thinks he has to fix things and to, like, change how Congress operates for the better.
SHERMAN: During the shutdown, during the immigration fight in late 2018, Jared Kushner was not really involved in the immigration policy and not really involved in anything that was going on. And the - as the government was about to shut down, moments from shutting down, Jared Kushner blew into a meeting with with Paul Ryan, Steve Scalise and Kevin McCarthy and said, I wasn't involved earlier, but now I am, and I can fix this quite quickly.
So Jared tended to think, according to people that we spoke to for the three-year period, 2 1/2-year period that we were writing this book, that he had a unique ability to, again, bend the government to his will and to do things that otherwise people thought were impossible. And he came up short a number of times. He did have one big success in the Trump administration, which was he passed - he helped pass a criminal justice reform bill. But that's about it. That's really the only episode where he had been successful in getting Congress to do what he wanted.
GROSS: Like a lot of other reporters, you reported that President Trump, you know, watches a lot of TV. And if he likes you on TV, he'll make an alliance with you or maybe give you an appointment (laughter). And so I'm wondering. He sees you on TV probably 'cause you - you're on TV a lot. And has that affected your access to him?
SHERMAN: I don't think so. I mean, he's acknowledged passively that he has seen us on TV earlier before we started writing this book. So I don't think it's impacted our access to him, but it certainly has impacted other people's access to him and frankly has impacted who he's put in key government positions and who he's given jobs to and who he likes defending him.
And I mean, we write in the book that members of Congress have literally rearranged their schedules so they can appear more frequently on television, which is really one of the chief ways that Washington has changed - is that daytime television is really prime real estate for policymakers and journalists and people who are trying to speak to the president or who want the president to hear them. I mean, dayside cable, which was at one point kind of an afterthought in the media climate, is now really prime territory for a lot of people.
GROSS: All right. I want to thank you both for talking with us.
SHERMAN: Thank you very much.
PALMER: Thank you.
GROSS: Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer are the authors of the new book ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America."" They co-write the daily newsletter Politico Playbook.
After a break, Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel by Sally Rooney, who's been called the first great millennial author. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.

Amazon Independent Booksellers Normal People , Sally Rooney's second novel, opens in 2011 in a small town in the west of Ireland, where two teenagers, improbably, hook up.
Marianne is a social pariah: She's really smart, lightly contemptuous and weird — a judgment bestowed on her by the cultural gatekeepers at her high school because ""she wears ugly thick-soled flat shoes and doesn't put make-up on her face.""
Connell, a football player, is also very smart, but he knows enough to turn the dimmer switch down on his intelligence, so he's popular. His mom cleans the large house that Marianne's family lives in.
Connell often picks his mom up at the end of her stint and Marianne is often sitting in the kitchen, reading The Fire Next Time or something equally challenging. They talk, they fall into bed together, they break up.
This ""wash-and-repeat"" romantic cycle continues far into their university years at Trinity College, Dublin. Eventually, Marianne confides in Connell that she was in a relationship with a man who beat her during sex. ""It was my idea, that I wanted to submit to him,"" she tells Connell. ""It's difficult to explain.""
It's an understatement to say that, as a chronicler of youthful Irish life and love, Sally Rooney is no Maeve Binchy. In fact, Rooney is a tough girl; her papercut-sharp sensibility is much more akin to writers like Rachel Kushner , Mary Gaitskill , and the pre- Manhattan Beach Jennifer Egan . Normal People moves forward in rough fragments: Instead of chapters, increments of this story are dated and given headings that read ""four months later;"" ""seven months later.""
The great poignancy of reading Normal People derives from being totally swept along by the force of Marianne's and Connell's psychological insights into each other or events and then witnessing how the solid certainty of those insights dissolves four months later or seven months later.
For instance, at the end of high school, when an anxious Connell, in a moment of cowardice, asks another girl to the formal dance (even though he and Marianne have been secretly sleeping together for a long time) we're treated to this self-lacerating assessment by Marianne:
[Connell] didn't do anything that bad. He had never tried to delude her into thinking she was socially acceptable; she'd deluded herself. He had just been using her as a kind of private experiment, and her willingness to be used had probably shocked him. ... In a way she feels sorry for him now, because he has to live with the fact that he had sex with her, of his own free choice, and he liked it. That says more about him, the supposedly ordinary and healthy person, than it does about her.
Rooney nails the bitter smarts of a certain kind of willfully odd teenage girl; but then, three months later, the joke is on Connell when Marianne's eccentricities render her chic and sought-after at university, while his working-class earnestness is socially toxic.
Class is one of Rooney's chief concerns here, especially as Connell, who's something of a budding writer, penetrates deeper and deeper into the smug undergraduate literary culture. Here's his wry take on a reading by a visiting celebrated writer:
Connell couldn't think of any reason why these literary events took place, what they contributed to anything, what they meant. They were attended only by people who wanted to be the kind of people who attended them. ...
[The reading itself] was culture as class performance, literature fetishized for its ability to take educated people on false emotional journeys, so that they might afterward feel superior to the uneducated people whose emotional journeys they liked to read about.
Whoa. For those of us who've attended (or perpetrated) more than our fair share of these types of literary events, Connell's pronouncements constitute a miniature instant classic of academic farce writing. He's so intense in his disdain; but, then, he's so intense in his desire. By the end of the novel, he's seriously deciding whether or not to enter an elite MFA program.
Normal People is a nuanced and flinty love story about two young people who ""get"" each other, despite class differences and the interference of their own vigorous personal demons. But honestly, Sally Rooney could write a novel about bath mats and I'd still read it. She's that good and that singular a writer.

"In 'All That You Leave Behind,' Erin Lee Carr Writes About Her Relationship With Dad David Carr : NPR",www.npr.org,Lily Meyer,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711352423/a-daughter-reflects-on-her-dads-ongoing-influence-in-all-that-you-leave-behind,"All That You Leave Behind A Memoir
by Erin Lee Carr
Hardcover, 240 All That You Leave Behind Subtitle A Memoir Author Erin Lee Carr Last winter, I took my father to the live journalism show Pop-Up Magazine. Neither of us expected to cry, but five minutes into documentarian Erin Lee Carr's beautifully constructed tribute to her late father, the famed New York Times media reporter David Carr, we were sobbing.
Carr wept, too. I left the event deeply moved, and deeply grateful to have my own father there. I expected Carr's memoir, All That You Leave Behind , to elicit the same level of feeling. On the page, however, she is much less successful at getting her emotions across.
In part, this might be a question of voice. Carr is a highly accomplished filmmaker, best known for her HBO documentaries Mommy Dead and Dearest and Thought Crimes , and her prose has a screenwriter's economy. She moves rapidly from scene to scene, never lingering on the complex emotions that memoirs are built to investigate. As a result, All That You Leave Behind functions far better as a portrait of David Carr than as one of the writer herself. She consistently lets her father overshadow her on the page.
This may be intentional. Toward the book's end, Carr cites her father's journalistic reminder that ""you are not an intrinsically interesting subject,"" and yet a memoirist must be interested in herself. How else can a memoir work? Carr often seems guarded or shy on the page, as if shielding her emotions from the reader. This is especially true in the chapters dealing with her alcohol abuse. She traces her struggle to get sober while processing her father's death, but nearly every scene ends with a blackout; she never tries to find out what happened, nor does she give voice to her sister, her best friend, and her boyfriend, all of whom were present throughout.
Nor does she fully examine an earlier attempt at sobriety, after her drinking began to threaten her career. Her father was alive then, and when she reached 90 days, he accompanied her to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, speaking to the room about ""his own attempts at ninety days, how hard won it was, and what it was like to see his kid get there."" Carr glosses over the speech itself, hurrying into a blankly positive reaction: ""I was proud to be with him, and felt lucky to have him.""
This is often Carr's way. She presents facts, then a neat summary of her feelings. When she allows complexity, it tends to be in lists of questions, which is clearly how her mind operates: After her father dies, she emails a questionnaire to friends who have coped with grief. More questionnaires would have suited All That You Leave Behind , but Carr often cuts them off too soon. In a section on her father's relapse into drinking during her adolescence, Carr approaches anger, then ducks into summary: ""Who drives their kids drunk? Who drinks on the way to a parent-teacher conference? I learned quickly that the circumstances did not matter when it came to my dad and alcohol.""
Carr's struggles with addiction link her to her father, but their most meaningful bond is ambition. She writes honestly and gratefully about her father's unwavering career support and guidance, and is excellent at noting the privilege of his help, as well as her resulting insecurities: ""How do I have a career without you?"" she asks in one list. ""Was my moderate success because of you? ... Why were you so hard on me?"" What she never fully explores is ""the tension of being both his kid and his mentee, one relationship always in conflict with the other.""
That tension simmers quietly through the memoir. I wanted far more from a scene at South by Southwest, when Carr drinks more than she means to at her father's annual media party. ""I went in for the hug with my dad,"" she writes at the start of the scene, ""and he started introducing me as his kid, who worked for VICE. People were kind, but I could tell instantly that I was not who they really wanted to be speaking with at such an event... [Before] I knew it I was seven beers deep."" It's difficult to read Carr's behavior here: Does she feel diminished, or embarrassed? Out of her depth? Is she trying to rebel against her father, or, as she occasionally wonders, imitate his younger self?
The closest Carr offers to an answer comes, obliquely, from her father. After a bad breakup, he emails her to say, ""[He] was a significant person in your life, but sadly not a significant person."" Carr takes this as comfort, and as an important lesson. It's also a lot of pressure. The mandate to be a significant person is present on every page in All That You Leave Behind. It may well be what stood between Carr and a more revealing, more nuanced, and perhaps messier version of this memoir.
As is, the book provokes both gratitude and empathy. But Carr's significant writing, in which she investigates herself with the rigor she brings to her journalistic subjects, is yet to come.

U.S. Will Leave 400 Troops In Syria,www.npr.org,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/02/22/696928907/u-s-will-leave-200-peacekeeping-troops-in-syria,"U.S. Will Leave 400 Troops In Syria Facebook Enlarge this image

Updated at 4:34 p.m. ET
The Trump administration is changing the number of American troops that will remain in Syria.
Approximately 400 troops will stay there, a senior administration official has told NPR. That's double the number announced Thursday night by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.
In Thursday's one-sentence statement, Sanders said: ""A small peacekeeping group of about 200 will remain in Syria for a period of time."" But the senior administration official said Friday the troops will be ""observers and monitors,"" and not a U.N.-style peacekeeping force.
The official said there is no timeline for the mission and no date for withdrawal.
About 200 troops will remain in the Syrian town of al-Tanf, near the border with Iraq. Their mission is to counter Iran and support U.S. forces in Iraq.
Another 200 will remain in northern Syria and be part of a ""multinational observer force"" numbering between 800 and 1,500, mostly European NATO allies, including France and Britain. They are located in the ""safe zone"" on the Turkish-Syrian border controlled by Kurdish allies of the U.S. who have led the ground war against ISIS. The American troops will be combat-ready but their role is to monitor the region.
According to The New York Times , the Sanders announcement came after a phone call between President Trump and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in which the two leaders agreed to create a safe zone in Syria. U.S.-Backed Kurdish Forces Launch 'Final Push' Against ISIS In Syria
In December, the White House said it would pull all 2,000 troops from Syria, a reversal of U.S. policy that reportedly was met with disapproval within the Pentagonand prompted Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to resign in protest .Troops began withdrawing in January, sparking criticism that the U.S. was leaving before it had completely eradicated the Islamic State presence there.
At a security conference in Munich last week, the U.S. encouraged its European allies to remain in Syria even as it was withdrawing. German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized the U.S. plan. ""Is it a good thing to immediately remove American troops from Syria, or will it not strengthen Russia and Iran's hand?"" she said.
Some have worried that Russia and Iran would fill the vacuum created by a U.S. pullout.
A senior administration official told the Times thatthe decision to leave some troops in Syria was intended to encourage France and Britain to also keep troops there. European countries had ""unanimously"" told the U.S. they wouldn't stay if American forces left, The Washington Post reported , quoting a senior administration official.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, applauded the decision. ""This will ensure ISIS does not return and Iran does not fill the vacuum that would have been left if we completely withdrew,"" he said in a statement . Senate Republicans Rebuke President On Syria And Afghanistan Policy
Graham, who had been critical of Trump's December decision to pull all troops, said keeping forces there ensures that the U.S. won't repeat the mistakes it made in Iraq. ""This also ensures Turkey and [Syrian Democratic Forces] elements that helped us defeat ISIS will not go into conflict,"" he said."

President Trump's plan to withdraw all U.S. military forces from Syria has triggered disparate responses — from worries in liberated Raqqa and Kurdish-controlled areas to approval from Syrian and Russian officials.
Trump declared victory over ISIS, saying in a video Wednesday night, ""We've beaten them and we've beaten them badly. We've taken back the land and now it's time for our troops to come back home.""
But that idea is at odds with the president's top military advisers, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who has resigned , effective in February, noting his disagreements with the president on Syria and other issues. Politics Secretary of Defense Mattis Will Resign, Tumultuous Week For WH Continues Secretary of Defense Mattis Will Resign, Tumultuous Week For WH Continues Embed Embed RSS link
Trump is also at odds with Gen. Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Early this month, Dunford refused to give a possible date for withdrawal from Syria , saying the job isn't over until areas are stabilized and local forces are trained and equipped to ensure security.
Then, days after Dunford made those comments, Trump announced Dunford's plans to retire , saying he would nominate Gen. Mark Milley to replace him. White House Orders Pentagon To Pull U.S. Troops From Syria
The U.S. currently has more than 2,000 troops in Syria, fighting alongside Arab and Kurdish forces.
In addition to the troops, the White House is also ordering the withdrawal of advisers who have been trying to help reconstruct Syria's infrastructure, which has been mangled by civil war. The State Department will also withdraw staff who have been working on essential issues, such as providing water and electricity, and trying to get children into schools.
For Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the decision represents a shift in priorities.
""The president made an enormous commitment to take down the caliphate, and that has been achieved,"" he told NPR's Morning Edition . ""We now have the .... counterterrorism battle — not only against ISIS but against al-Qaida and others.""
That assessment view has not been accepted universally, however. Several of the countries involved in the Syrian conflict have voiced their opinions on the decision. Here's a roundup of some key players:

In Raqqa, fears of a power vacuum
""The Syrian Democratic Forces — that's the U.S.'s local Kurdish led partner there — are saying it's just not true that ISIS has been defeated. And they're saying that this withdrawal will damage the remaining fight against ISIS,"" NPR's Ruth Sherlock reports from Beirut.
""There's also a lot of panic among civilians. We reached people in Raqqa, that's one of the main cities that were largely destroyed in this war against ISIS. And they say they just don't know who will control this area now.""
Both the Syrian regime and Turkey want to take the area away from Kurdish control, Sherlock said. And there is also the chance that there will simply be a vacuum of power, she added.
""One person we spoke to said they're afraid that ISIS will exploit this chaos and return to this area — just like extremists did when the U.S. pulled out of Iraq after the war there.""
In the city of Kobani near the Turkish-Syrian border, Kurds have been digging tunnels out of concern that Turkey might stage an attack.
""Now with the U.S. leaving, there's a sense that they don't have any cover to protect them anymore, and that it's more likely that the Turks will move in,"" Sherlock says. ""They are saying that they feel a deep sense of abandonment from the U.S."" Enlarge this image

Israel projects a mixture of caution and resolve
An ally of President Trump and an outspoken hawk, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu navigated a fine line in his comments immediately after Trump's announcement.
""This is, of course, an American decision,"" Netanyahu said in a statement released Wednesday , noting that Trump and Pompeo had alerted him to the move before they made it public.
""We will learn its schedule, its mode of operation and of course the implications for us,"" he added. ""In any event, we will make sure to maintain Israel's security and protect ourselves from this arena.""
At the same time, in recorded remarks , Netanyahu made clear the U.S. decision will not affect Israel's own military activities in Syria. As we speak, we’re employing means to neutralize these tunnels, and we’ll continue to act in Syria to prevent Iran’s effort to militarily entrench itself against us. We are not going to reduce our efforts; we’re going to increase our efforts. pic.twitter.com/oVsdGQrJ3l — PM of Israel (@IsraeliPM) December 20, 2018
""Israel continues its operation against the Hamas terror tunnels, and will do so until its completion,"" he said, referring to the country's attempts to block tunnels that Palestinian militants have built to infiltrate Israeli territory. ""As we speak, we're employing special means to neutralize these tunnels.""
Coupled with those efforts along its border with the Gaza Strip, Israel recently launched a similar operation on its border with Lebanon, intended to ""expose and destroy"" tunnels built by the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. Israel's Army Says It Found Tunnels Dug By Hezbollah Beneath Border With Lebanon
Israel has attacked Iranian forces directly in Syria, carrying out airstrikes on what it calls dozens of Iranian military targets in the country. About four months ago, Israeli intelligence forces also reportedly assassinated a Syrian rocket scientist who they believed had been collaborating with Iran.
""We will continue to take very strong action against Iran's efforts to entrench in Syria,"" Netanyahu added. ""In neither of these fronts do we intend to lessen our efforts; we will intensify them, and I know that we do so with the full support and backing of the United States.""

Turkey steps up the pressure — but toward what end?
The Turkish military has long had an intense interest in its neighbor to the east — an interest that flared into violence earlier this year, when Turkey launched an operation to clear Kurdish fighters from the borderlands between the two countries.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan views the YPG, a Syrian Kurdish militia, as a terrorist organization allied with the separatist Kurdish groups operating within his own borders. But that view was not shared by the U.S., which irked its NATO ally with its decision to arm and support the YPG in the fight against ISIS.
Now that Turkey is eyeing a future in Syria without U.S. intervention, its leaders have sent some mixed signals on what it plans to do next.
On one hand, during a joint news conference Thursday with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Erdogan announced an intention to ""increase our efforts to ensure permanent peace that will embrace Syria and whole Syrian people"" — and he vowed to cooperate closely with Iran toward that end, Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency reports.
On the other hand, Erdogan's top ministers appear to be gearing up for battle.
Kurdish terrorists are ""digging some trenches and tunnels in Manbij and east of the Euphrates,"" Defense Minister Hulusi Akar told troops Thursday, saying the Turkish military is preparing ""intensely"" for a new offensive, according to Anadolu .
""Whatever they dig, trenches or tunnels,"" he added, ""when the time comes they will be buried in the trenches that they dig. Of this there should be no doubt.""
Russia's Vladimir Putin: ""Donald is right""
Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed news of the U.S. withdrawal, saying during a news conference Thursday, ""Donald is right, I agree with him,"" according to NPR's Lucian Kim. ""Donald is right, I agree with him."" Putin says ISIS has been dealt a serious blow in Syria. ""If US has decided to withdraw its contingent, it's the right thing to do."" pic.twitter.com/fvuASAqxIk — Lucian Kim (@Lucian_Kim) December 20, 2018
ISIS has suffered serious blows in Syria, Putin said.
But while the Russian president agreed with Trump's talk of leaving, he also suggested he would wait and see what the U.S. does.
Kim paraphrased Putin's observation that ""We haven't seen any signs of U.S. withdrawal from Syria yet. [The ] U.S. has been in Afghanistan 17 years and almost every year they say they're leaving.""
Putin also reiterated that in his view, the U.S. troop presence in Syria ""is illegitimate as it was not approved by a U.N. Security Council resolution."" By contrast, he noted, ""Russian troops were invited by the Syrian government."" After U.S. Troops Leave Syria, What Happens Next?
France: ISIS ""has not been wiped from the map""
In announcing his decision to withdraw troops from Syria, Trump declared that ""we have defeated ISIS in Syria"" — but that view is far from shared by a close U.S. ally.
""Daesh is weaker than ever,"" Florence Parly, France's armed forces minister, said Thursday on Trump's medium of choice , referring to ISIS by its Arabic acronym.
""But,"" she added, ""Daesh has not been removed from the map, nor have its roots. The last pockets of this terrorist organization must be defeated militarily once and for all.""
The country's Foreign Ministry echoed this continued commitment.
""In the coming weeks, France will endeavor to ensure the security of all U.S. partners, including the Syrian Democratic Forces,"" a ministry spokesperson said in a media briefing Thursday. ""The United States must take the protection of the populations of northeastern Syria and the stability of this area into consideration in order to avoid any further humanitarian tragedies and any return by the terrorists.""

Japan's military has confirmed that one of its F-35A jet fighters has crashed in the Pacific Ocean during a training exercise. National broadcaster NHK reports that search crews have recovered part of the plane's tail.
As of midday Wednesday in Japan, the plane's pilot, reportedly in his 40s, was still missing. It is not clear whether he ejected before the plane crashed. NHK quotes Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya as saying that the military is focusing on rescuing the pilot and investigating the cause of the crash. He added that the U.S. military is assisting with the search.
The crash has raised concerns both about the safety of the F-35, which Japan plans to adopt as the mainstay of its air force, and the possible intelligence windfall that any foreign government could score, in the event that they could beat Japanese or U.S. search crews to the missing plane's wreckage.
The plane took off from Misawa airbase in northeast Japan's Aomori prefecture around 7 p.m. for a combat training exercise with three other jets. There were no signs of any problem until a half-hour later, when the pilot communicated that he was calling off the mission. The plane then disappeared from the radar, roughly 80 miles east of Misawa.
Misawa is home to both U.S. and Japanese air forces. It is also reportedly a center for the allies to collect signals intelligence. It is home to Japan's first squadron of F-35A fighters, which began operations just last month.
The Reuters news agency reports that the F-35 was less than a year old. It is made by Lockheed Martin, but the crashed plane is the first to be assembled in Japan by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Nagoya, Japan. The F-35 went into service, for the U.S. Marine Corps, in 2015. Two have now crashed in the years since.
Japan has grounded its 12 remaining F-35As at Misawa, as well as other military flights.
The so-called ""fifth generation"" fighter plane costs about $100 million, and Japan plans to buy about 150 more of them from the U.S., more than any other customer.
The purchase affects the balance of payments between the U.S. and Japan, as the U.S. pushes its main allies, including South Korea and Germany, to shoulder more defense costs, including the basing of U.S. troops on their soil.
For Japan, the F-35 purchase is part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's strategy to build up its military, to cast off its postwar constitutional limitations, to make it more independent of its U.S. allies, and to deter China in long-simmering territorial disputes in the East China Sea.
China is developing its own fifth-generation stealth fighters and is expected to deploy more of them than Japan, even with its purchase of F-35s, over the next decade and beyond.
While there are no indications that anyone other than Japan and the U.S. are trying to recover the crashed F-35, the concern that it might fall into foreign hands, such as Russia's or China's, is a reminder that U.S. ""forward deployed"" forces in the western Pacific operate in a crowded region, where chance encounters and competition with other major powers is a constant condition. Correction April 11, 2019
In a previous version of this report, we said the F-35 has been in service for nearly two decades. In fact, it went into service in 2015. Development of the fighter began a little more than two decades ago."

Torres Says U.S. Needs To Focus On Root Cause Of Migration Crisis, Rep. Torres Says Embed Embed Heard on Morning Edition
David Greene talks to Democratic Rep. Norma Torres of California about Trump's toughening immigration policies, and the effects on Central American asylum-seekers. NPR's Mara Liasson weighs in.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The numbers are the highest they have been in years. U.S. Customs and Border Protection say more than 103,000 people tried to cross the southern border into the United States last month. The sheer volume of migrants is overwhelming the U.S. government on the southern border, and amid this swell, President Trump is purging the top ranks of the Department of Homeland Security. He's also promising to cut off aid to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Representative Norma Torres is a Democrat from California who was born in Guatemala before coming to the U.S. She's the only member of Congress who was born in Central America, and she joins us in our studio in Washington this morning.
Congresswoman, thank you so much for coming in.
NORMA TORRES: Thank you, David.
GREENE: So these numbers seem to grow more and more by the day. What do you attribute this to right now?
TORRES: Well, I attribute that to many issues, but mostly I blame the Trump administration for failing to follow up on the good work that had already been established by the Obama administration. When we were addressing the root causes of migration and dealing with those very, very corrupt governments in the Northern Triangle, you know, Vice President Biden at the time flew down to the region constantly, every other month at least, and met with the Northern Triangle presidents directly. They came to the U.S. and met with him here often. So there was always an agenda on how to move things forward and address the deep-rooted issues of not just public corruption but the gang violence and the lack of economic development in the region.
GREENE: Many of the forces that are driving people to come. Can you just explain to Americans who would ask why it's the responsibility of the United States to improve conditions in countries like this?
TORRES: No. 1, I think from, you know, a perspective of our national security, we better be paying attention to democracy and the rule of law and how all of those things are eroding within our region. And these are our closest neighbors to the south - Mexico and the Northern Triangle. So we better care about that because we cannot - we simply cannot put a border at our southern wall - I mean, a wall at our southern border - and think that that is going to be the solution. That is just a Band-Aid. People will continue to come, and we will have more deaths on our hands if we don't focus on the region.
GREENE: Can you remind me of your own story and why your family decided to come to the U.S.?
TORRES: Yes. So I was born in Guatemala, and I can't imagine, David, what my parents, you know, might have been going through when they decided that it was safer for me for them to send me to the U.S. to live with my father's oldest brother, my uncle. My story is like many of those children at the border. They're trying to reunite with their family. It's heartbreaking. During my time, thank God that America was not closed. Thank God that they opened their arms and I was able to succeed and go to school and learn the language and embrace the culture, which is what these people want to do when they get here - to be able to work and be able to live another day. Circumstances at times might have changed a little bit. There's maybe no longer a civil war, but the war in the streets between gangs, between narco traffickers - the public corruption is still there, and those are the issues that we need to focus on.
GREENE: When we had a reporting team last week in El Paso, we spoke to some of the migrant families coming. Some of them said they were fleeing violence, without a doubt, but some told us it was just extreme poverty, saying they just wanted to give their kids a better life. For Americans who look around our own country and see poverty, can you just explain why people who are looking for a better life - economic migrants - should be considered for asylum here?
TORRES: Right. The poverty we see here in our own communities, you know, in comparison to the poverty that has been caused by climate change issues, severe droughts in the region, the fact that there is no infrastructure for the indigenous populations, you know, to get, you know, any of their merchandise to market - they have major issues of stunting because of poor malnutrition. These are the reasons why we have people coming from the highlands in Guatemala. If we were to follow, you know, the president's orders and stop sending aid to Central America, imagine what we will see when the youth in the inner cities begin to not get the assistance they need - education programs, job training programs, and just, you know, help with everyday living that they need in the region. When you allow their elected officials to be so corrupt, there's not enough money to pay for the services that they need.
GREENE: Congresswoman Norma Torres is a Democratic representative from Congress from California who was born in Guatemala. Thank you so much for your time this morning.
TORRES: Thank you so much, David.
GREENE: I want to turn to NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, who has covered the debate over immigration in this country for years as it has been going on. Mara, as you listen to that conversation, what do you take away?
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Well, we're having a debate in this country about how open the United States should be to people who are fleeing economic problems not just civil war. As the congresswoman just said, the civil war in Guatemala is over. But all - lots of things that force people to flee are still there, whether it's crime and violence and poverty. But the president the other day said, quote, ""we can't take you anymore. Our country is full. We can't take you anymore. I'm sorry."" So, you know, he believes there's really no room for anyone else, even though we're facing a looming labor shortage. But that's the debate going on right now. How many people should the U.S. take in? What should be the criteria?
GREENE: And it seems like both sides in this debate are only, I mean, taking more to their extreme views and playing to their bases, right? I mean, there's a lot of turnover right now in the Trump administration. Today's the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's last day. She tweeted that her acting deputy secretary, Claire Grady, has offered to resign. Like, the president is looking for a tougher policy, not looking for somewhere to meet in the middle.
LIASSON: No, he's not looking to make a deal with Congress, even though he says it's the Democrats' fault for not changing the laws to make it easier to prevent asylum-seekers from getting asylum. But what he wants is bureaucratic changes in the Department of Homeland Security. That's why he's doing this personnel housecleaning. He wants to toughen up the criteria for credible fear - in other words, what asylum-seekers have to prove to get asylum. He thinks that DHS officials have a reflexive tendency to believe asylum-seekers. He also wants immigration officials to give fewer work permits to people in the asylum process. He thinks that will cut down on the surge.

No More Magic: Johnson Abruptly Resigns From The LA Lakers,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711691359/no-more-magic-johnson-abruptly-resigns-from-the-la-lakers,"Mark J. Terrill/AP
Magic Johnson isn’t having fun anymore.
“Today, I’m going to step down as president,” the former NBA superstar told a gaggle of reporters on Tuesday night, about an hour and a half before the Los Angeles Lakers played their last game of the season. “I was happier when I wasn’t the president.”
Johnson has served as the team’s president of basketball operations for more than two years — the latest move in a long and successful career as a businessman and philanthropist after he first retired in 1991 when he tested positive for HIV. He came back to be part of the U.S. Olympic “Dream Team” in 1992 and then again to play for the Lakers in the 1995-96 season.
His resignation came out of the blue; on Monday, Johnson had a three-hour meeting about the team’s future after its sixth consecutive losing season, the Associated Press reported .
Reporters and basketball fans weren’t the only ones to find out about his resignation late in the game.
“Somebody’s gonna have to tell my boss,” Johnson told reporters.
His boss is Lakers controlling owner Jeanie Buss, who hired Johnson just over two years ago after she dismissed her brother Jim, who was vice president of basketball operations, and General Manager Mitch Kupchak in an effort to change things up after multiple losing seasons. Magic Johnson is conducting an impromptu press conference and just stepped down as Lakers president. He said he loves Jeanie Buss like a sister.
— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) April 10, 2019
Johnson said he just couldn’t face Buss, who he called “my sister.”
“Have you really not told Jeanie yet?” a reporter asked.
“No, I haven’t. I couldn’t,” he answered. “She doesn’t know I’m standing here because I knew I would be crying like a baby in front of her.”
The Hall of Famer barely kept it together in front of the press: “I’m about to cry now,” he said.
When his boss inevitably heard the news, the Lakers issued a statement thanking Johnson for his time with the team. “There is no greater Los Angeles Laker than Earvin Johnson,” the statement said. “He will always be not only a Lakers icon, but our family.”
Buss also tweeted her thanks: Earvin, I loved working side by side with you. You’ve brought us a long way. We will continue the journey. We love you ?? https://t.co/ofmQl6BtBz
— Jeanie Buss (@JeanieBuss) April 10, 2019
But not everyone thought Johnson was good for the Lakers.
“It’s a mess,” sports anchor Rob Parker said recently, calling him “tragic Johnson.”
“Nobody … thought that the Lakers wouldn’t make the playoffs when LeBron James came here, even with the injury,” Parker said.
James, who joined the LA team in July of last year, didn’t comment on Johnson’s resignation on Tuesday. LeBron James didn’t address the media and had his security try to stop reporters who came near him. LeBron on the phone: “Crazy, crazy, crazy.” Yep. pic.twitter.com/PObznj26Rd
— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) April 10, 2019
Johnson didn’t give any specific reasons for his decision to quit.
He said he’s happy with where the team has gone during his two years. “We’re halfway there with LeBron coming back,” Johnson said. “I think this team is going to be in the position to really contend for a championship with the growth of the young players.”
The Lakers ended their season with a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday night, after being eliminated from the playoff race last month.
They used to be a top team, with 16 NBA titles. But they haven’t made the playoffs in six years.
Johnson said he is not stepping down because of differences he’s had with the team’s coach of three years, Luke Walton.
“I like Luke a lot,” Johnson said. “We have different opinions about different things — that’s OK.”
It’s been widely reported that the Lakers were expected to dismiss Walton at the end of the regular season.
Walton told reporters he didn’t know Johnson was planning to quit. “I found out the same time as you guys,” the coach said at a press conference after the team’s Tuesday night game.
However, Johnson did suggest vaguely that his departure had to do with an upcoming confrontation.
“Tomorrow, I would have to affect somebody’s life — ruin their life,” he said. “That’s not fun for me, that’s not who I am.”
Delivering bad news — that’s one of the job requirements Johnson said he doesn’t like. He talked about the challenge of having to trade players that he likes. Magic Johnson just gave the longest, strangest, greatest “I’m stepping down” press conference I have ever witnessed. Just beautifully bizarre and completely contradictory. None of it made sense – except he is now so happy & so relieved to be going back to his old life.
— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) April 10, 2019
Johnson would rather be on the other side of things, helping mentor players such as tennis champion Serena Williams and the Philadelphia 76ers’ Ben Simmons.
But NBA rules prevent teams — including players, coaches and management — from doing anything that might entice a player away from another team they’re under contract with. Mentoring another player can be construed as tampering.
Johnson has been investigated by the NBA for tampering four times, including for his response to a mentoring request from Simmons in February. Also this year, Johnson incurred a $500,000 fine for “impermissible contact” with Oklahoma City Thunder player Paul George’s agent, and another $50,000 for praising Milwaukee Bucks player Giannis Antetokounmpo.
Johnson said he’s had enough of the tampering charges. “I can’t help young men who want me to help them,” he said. “I don’t like that; I like to be free.”
He also said he was tired of “the backstabbing and the whispering” associated with his leadership position.
“What am I doing? I’ve got a beautiful life,” said Johnson, laughing. “So I’m gonna go back to that beautiful life.”"
Colorado's 'Red Flag' Gun Measure Raises Concerns,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711714596/colorados-red-flag-gun-measure-raises-concerns,"Colorado's 'Red Flag' Gun Measure Raises Concerns Colorado's 'Red Flag' Gun Measure Raises Concerns Embed Embed Bente Birkeland
From
Democratic Gov. Jared Polis is expected to sign the bill this week, allowing guns to be temporarily taken from individuals deemed a threat to themselves or others.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Colorado's red flag gun measure is raising red flags of its own. The law is designed to allow family members or law enforcement to petition courts to temporarily take guns away from people deemed a threat to themselves or others. More than a dozen other states already have so-called red flag gun laws on the books. State lawmakers have passed the bill in Colorado, and the governor there says he will sign it. But some gun rights groups and law enforcement say they just won't follow the law. Here's Bente Birkeland of Colorado Public Radio.
BENTE BIRKELAND, BYLINE: Even though the gun bill hasn't been signed, it's already leading to potential recall efforts and legal challenges, and roughly half of the state's counties oppose it. Steve Reams is the Weld County Sheriff in northern Colorado. He says the law won't make anyone safer.
STEVE REAMS: Just taking someone's firearms away and leaving them in place doesn't solve the problem, in my mind. It could actually make it worse in some scenarios. And we're kicking the can down the road to deal with the mental health issue.
BIRKELAND: A big sticking point for critics is that the burden of proof would be on gun owners to get their firearms back by showing that they're no longer a risk. Reams says he's willing to go to jail rather than follow a court's order to seize someone's guns.
REAMS: In my oath of office, it reads that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of the state of Colorado. Obviously, that creates a concern if a law is adopted that I believe is in conflict with either the state constitution or the United States Constitution.
JARED POLIS: The job of a sheriff is to enforce the law, not make the law. I mean, if they want to make the law, they should run for a different office.
BIRKELAND: That's Democratic Governor Jared Polis. He estimates the red flag law would be used about 50 times a year.
POLIS: It would be a great concern if this was used more broadly. It should be a very, very high bar to even temporarily remove that right because it's a constitutional right, which I strongly support.
BIRKELAND: Colorado is home to two of the country's most infamous mass shootings - the one at Columbine High School 20 years ago this month and another at an Aurora movie theater in 2012. The following year, when Democrats passed stricter gun laws, two state lawmakers were recalled.
MEG FROELICH: We are a Western state with a libertarian streak. We are a strong outdoors state with hunting and fishing.
BIRKELAND: That's Democratic Representative Meg Froehlich.
FROELICH: So I think all of those make for a more nuanced discussion on this issue.
BIRKELAND: She's among several Democrats potentially facing a recall election for supporting the red flag gun bill. Froelich thinks it will reduce gun violence and save lives. She says a recall campaign from Republicans would be a waste of taxpayer money.
FROELICH: Why not call for an exciting agenda of what you want to do and what solutions you're offering?
BIRKELAND: Tom Sullivan is a Democratic representative who sponsored the bill. He got involved in politics after his son, Alex, was killed in the Aurora shooting when a gunman opened fire on moviegoers. Sullivan says, after six years without any new gun control laws in Colorado, this is a much needed win.
TOM SULLIVAN: When the final vote was taken, I just had that moment where, you know, you could close your eyes, take a deep breath, appreciate what has happened. But then you open your eyes and that's not the end of, you know, the pain and the sorrow - and it's just the next day of it.
BIRKELAND: Sullivan plans to frame the signed bill and hang it on his office wall. He says it'll go next to the poster honoring his son and other Aurora shooting victims.

New Hampshire Aims To Change Legal Fee Policy For Indegent Defendants,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711693214/new-hampshire-aims-to-change-legal-fee-policy-for-indegent-defendants,"New Hampshire Aims To Change Legal Fee Policy For Indigent Defendants New Hampshire Aims To Change Legal Fee Policy For Indigent Defendants Embed Embed Todd Bookman
From
Criminal case defendants are provided an attorney if they can't afford one. They usually are billed for that representation, even if they're found not guilty. New Hampshire wants the policy change.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
What happens if you're charged with a serious crime and you can't afford an attorney? In criminal cases, defendants are provided a court-appointed attorney. But in most states, so-called indigent defendants still get slapped with a bill for that legal representation, even if they are found not guilty. New Hampshire Public Radio's Todd Bookman reports on an effort there to give innocent defendants a pass.
TODD BOOKMAN, BYLINE: If he knew all the stress it was going to cause him, the money it would cost him, Tobias Tarr probably wouldn't have gotten involved. June of 2017, a drunk guy arrived at the homeless shelter where Tarr was living.
TOBIAS TARR: I sat with him on the couch and just calmed him down. And he had it in his head he wanted to beat somebody up upstairs.
BOOKMAN: Tarr couldn't control the guy, though. So the shelter manager called the cops. Soon, a bunch of police were on scene. The room was crowded. The drunk guy was losing it. It was tense. Then all of a sudden...
TARR: Chaos. And I cannot stress enough - chaos.
BOOKMAN: Tarr says that when he tried to leave the room, an officer thought he bumped into him. They tackled Tarr. They tackled the drunk guy. Law enforcement would later allege that during the scuffle, Tarr reached for an officer's gun. He was charged with a felony and some misdemeanors and appointed a public defender. The case went to trial.
TARR: Not guilty on all three charges.
BOOKMAN: No jail time, no fines. But there was something waiting for Tarr.
TARR: I got a bill from them in the mail. I didn't have the money to pay nearly $700-and-something.
BOOKMAN: In the state of New Hampshire, in most states, indigent defendants - people deemed too poor to afford their own lawyer - are still required to pay for part of their legal defense, even when they're found innocent or when the charges are dropped.
GILLES BISSONNETTE: So really, by definition, this whole process is really designed to squeeze blood from the stone.
BOOKMAN: This is Gilles Bissonnette with the ACLU of New Hampshire.
BISSONNETTE: These are poor people. The court has found these individuals indigent. They're constitutionally entitled to representation. Yet they get, you know, a big, fat bill that they ultimately need to pay the state.
BOOKMAN: The ACLU is backing legislation that would prevent New Hampshire from seeking that money from those found not guilty. State Senator Shannon Chandley says a couple of other states - including California, Kansas - already have that exemption.
SHANNON CHANDLEY: So this bill would bring us into line with what those states are already doing. We're not breaking new ground here.
BOOKMAN: Currently, New Hampshire brings in about $1.5 million each year through these collections. And by all accounts, the state is flexible, putting people on interest-free, long-term payment plans. Charlie Arlinghaus, who oversees the department that collects the payments, sees it this way.
CHARLIE ARLINGHAUS: We're asking you to support a service that you're provided, whether you're convicted or not convicted. But it's not meant to be a punishment.
BOOKMAN: Tobias Tarr - the guy from the homeless shelter who was found not guilty - he has his own perspective on it. He was facing years in jail, so $800 is kind of small potatoes.
TARR: Is it fair? No, it's not fair. But that's the lesser of spending numerous years in prison for something that you didn't do. So I would gladly pay it. Do I think it's right? No, I don't.
BOOKMAN: Tarr is a stonemason. He doesn't have steady work. But he's going to try to make his first $10 payment to the state this month. At that rate, he'll have the debt paid off in a little over six years.

Little-Remembered Religious Preachers Get Their Due In Adam Morris' 'American Messiahs' : NPR,www.npr.org,Tom Gjelten,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711365122/little-remembered-religious-preachers-get-their-due-in-american-messiahs,"American Messiahs False Prophets of a Damned Nation
by Adam Morris
Hardcover, 413 American Messiahs Subtitle False Prophets of a Damned Nation Author Adam Morris There was the preacher who told his followers he could teach them to defy gravity. And another who insisted the sun is actually at the center of the earth. Then there was the Quaker who became delirious, died, and then was said to have come back to life as the reincarnated Jesus Christ.
It is little wonder that the succession of messianic prophets who emerged over the first two centuries of U.S. history have not been taken seriously. Jim Jones gained notoriety only by overseeing the massacre of 900 of his followers. The Shakers are famous mostly for their furniture. Who knows of George Baker, Cyrus Teed, or Jemima Wilkinson? The characters that come to life in American Messiahs, as author Adam Morris writes, have appeared ""irrelevant to American historians, aberrant to contemporary evangelicals, and abhorrent to the average consumerist.""
Morris is wise to give these forgotten messiahs the attention they deserve. Bizarre as they were, many were stunningly successful, leading movements that flourished over many years, due in good part to their success at identifying sources of social distress in the country and offering responses that actually made sense to people.
The evolution of American politics and American religion is ""a single intertwined history,"" as Morris writes. Protestantism in particular, from the Puritans to the evangelicals, emphasized individual responsibility and celebrated financial success, providing thereby a moral foundation for capitalism. Those Americans who felt marginalized and powerless, meanwhile, were drawn to more eccentric religious teachings, ones that spoke to their alienation and sense of vulnerability.
Especially appealing were those movements that drew their inspiration from early Christianity. Messianic cults are so-named because their leaders often portrayed themselves as latter-day messiahs, personifying at least the spirit of Christ or claiming that Christ was speaking through them.
Just as Jesus asked his apostles to give up their possessions and follow him, messianic leaders called on their followers to turn their accumulated wealth over to the group and live communally. Those people who responded found their lives simplified, their most basic needs met, and their loneliness diminished, thanks to close and comforting support from fellow believers.
One of the early leaders was Jemima Wilkinson, who, after seemingly arising from the dead in 1776, announced that hers was ""the Body which God had prepared for the Spirit to dwell in"" and that she was now a he, to be known as the ""Public Universal Friend"" or ""the Comforter."" Serving as an itinerant prophet over the next 40 years, the Friend gained fame across New England and established colonies of devoted followers.
Another early figure who left her mark on American religion was Ann Lee, an English woman who immigrated to America in 1774. Her deep religious convictions came after encountering the English evangelist George Whitehead, while her extreme piety was, at least in part, a response to the great offense she took at overhearing her parents' lovemaking. Given to visions and spiritual tremors, Lee was an early convert to a prophetic movement characterized by trembling and ecstatic convulsions. In America, the ""Shakers"" became known for their advocacy of celibacy, a practice that meant their growth came only through conversions.
In one way or another, almost all of America's messianic leaders have been spiritualists, claiming various powers of clairvoyance. Thomas Lake Harris, who said he witnessed his wife's ascent to heaven when she died, appeared to be especially adept at communicating with the spirit world.
""During one memorable projection,"" Morris notes, ""Harris telepathically transported himself to a meeting of spiritual dignitaries convened in a Greek amphitheater. ... Later on, [he] was privy to a conversation between the spirits of Plato, Socrates, Swedenborg, the Dutch microbiologist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, and the ancient Greek painter Zeuxis.""
For all their nuttiness, however, the messianic cults often addressed pressing social issues at the time. Women played much more important roles in these movements than they did in the rest of society, and virtually all the messianic leaders were fervent advocates of women's rights. With their devotion to ""apostolic communism,"" they were critics of labor exploitation, corporate greed, and racial discrimination, and they eloquently denounced the failure of conventional religion to address those problems.
Cyrus Teed, who developed a practice in medicine and alchemy in the mid-19th century and claimed to be the reincarnation of the prophet Elijah, offered what Morris calls ""a stern, puritanical critique of the 'prostituted' Christian churches, which in his view had become the servants of oppressive capitalist institutions."" His movement, committed to a communist lifestyle, ""functioned as one of many outlets for the urban unrest and bourgeois malaise in late-Victorian Chicago.""
One of Teed's successors, George Baker, a black man who disavowed all racial identities, led one of the most successful messianic movements in the early 20th century, with as many as 50,000 followers. Taking the name Father Divine, he established more than 150 ""peace missions"" across North America by 1936. His institutions were among the few hotels and restaurants in the 1930s that accommodated both blacks and whites, and his followers proposed anti-lynching legislation and advocated for European Jews when other progressive groups were not yet rising to the occasion.
Morris relates this history in a tone that is at once mocking and respectful. Teed's movement is presented as ""a viable alternative to the alienation of secularized industrial urbanism and a political-spiritual antidote to the anodyne mainline Protestantism that increasingly served as a handmaiden to big business."" But Teed is also the man who preached that Earth was hollow, with the sun inside.
Father Divine was viewed in his lifetime as one of the most important civil rights leaders in America, Morris says, but he also quotes Divine as suggesting that Jesus Christ was possibly ""a Martian or a Jupiterian or is from some other planet where there is a superior form of life.""
Morris is more disdainful of one of Father Divine's most important followers, a man who took the name John the Revelator. Smitten by a 17-year-old ""angel"" he named Delight, the Revelator took her with him to Los Angeles.
""In L.A.,"" Morris writes, ""he convinced the girl that she was the Virgin Mary and was destined to give birth to the Messiah in Hawaii. In the Revelator's prophecy, the birth was to be the result of immaculate conception, but he had sex with Delight anyway.""
The account of America's messianic leaders ends with the story of Jim Jones, the charismatic but paranoid preacher whose interracial Peoples Temple settlement appeared for a time to be a respectable left-wing commune. California State Assemblyman Willie Brown, San Francisco Mayor George Moscone, and California Gov. Jerry Brown were among the California politicians willing to be associated with Jones in the time before he led his followers to mass suicide.
Like many of the messianic leaders who preceded him, Jones convinced his followers that he had special powers. He had associates secretly gather private information about his followers, which Jones then publicly revealed, to the astonishment of his audience.
""Throughout the healing segment of his services, Jones would don his famous dark glasses to facilitate his 'trance,'"" Morris writes. ""In fact, the glasses hid the source of his clairvoyance: looking down to read from the notecards that ... spies supplied.""
It was a technique other messianic leaders before him had used. Throughout his book, Morris makes clear how much these movements had in common: their claims of divinity; their apocalyptic visions; their semi-socialist ideologies — and often their fraudulence. His writing is sharp and the story is entertaining, though Morris makes clear his purpose is entirely serious: to say these cultists' rejection of society, conventional economic activity, and organized religion says more in the end about the failings of the institutions they left than about the goofy ones they built in their place."

Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images Federal prosecutors on Tuesday said they dismantled one of the largest health care fraud schemes ever investigated by the FBI, charging 24 people in a $1.2 billion alleged scam involving telemedicine and durable medical equipment companies.
As part of the complex operation, doctors got kickbacks for prescribing unneeded back, shoulder, wrist and knee braces to elderly and disabled patients and charging the government's Medicare program, the Department of Justice said.
The accused ""concocted an elaborate scheme to exploit the U.S. health care system by targeting Medicare beneficiaries, paying doctors for prescriptions, paying kickbacks and bribes, and in turn selling these prescriptions to DME companies to ensure that they could line their pockets,"" IRS special agent Matthew Line said, according to Tut Underwood of South Carolina Public Radio.
Prosecutors allege a multilayered scheme to defraud Medicare. Call centers in the Philippines and Latin America advertised to Medicare beneficiaries and ""up-sold"" them on unnecessary medical braces, they say.
The call centers then paid bribes to telemedicine companies, who in turn paid doctors to write orders for the equipment. Then the call centers sold the orders to the durable medical equipment companies and billed Medicare.
Shots - Health News HHS Inspector General's Report Finds Flaws And Fraud In U.S. Hospice Care Equipment companies would ship the braces to beneficiaries. They would receive about $500 to $900 per brace from Medicare and paid kickbacks of almost $300 per brace, according to the Associated Press.
Doctors wrote prescriptions for medical equipment without any interaction with patients or after only a brief phone conversation, the DOJ said.
People participating in the alleged scheme laundered money through shell companies and used proceeds to buy ""exotic automobiles, yachts and luxury real estate in the United States and abroad.""
CEOs, COOs and associates with five telemedicine companies; owners of durable medical equipment companies; and three licensed medical professionals were among the 24 people charged.
Shots - Health News Documents Reveal Secret Legal Battle Over Medicare Overbilling Prosecutors charged residents of several states, including Florida, New Jersey, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, California and New York.
The government Center for Medicare Services' anti-fraud branch said it took ""adverse administrative action"" against 130 medical equipment companies that had billed Medicare more than $1.7 billion in claims and were paid more than $900 million.
The IRS chief of criminal investigation, Don Fort, said in a statement that the organized scheme ""details broad corruption, massive amounts of greed, and systemic flaws in our healthcare system that were exploited by the defendants.""
The FBI, IRS and 17 U.S. attorneys' offices took part in the operation, according to AP."
'Medicine' To Make You Feel 'Inmortal': Our Favorite Latin Songs This Week,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/altlatino/2019/04/10/711501308/medicine-to-make-you-feel-inmortal-our-favorite-latin-songs-this-week,"Enlarge this image Hear Lila Downs' new Peruvian cumbia classic on this week's Alt.Latino music roundup. Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist Hear Lila Downs' new Peruvian cumbia classic on this week's Alt.Latino music roundup.
Courtesy of the artist This week, the Latin music world is quaking! Bachata band Aventura reemerge from the shadows with their first song in 10 years, Jennifer Lopez duets with French Montana and Lila Downs releases a fresh Peruvian cumbia classic. You can also hear the follow-up to Anitta 's trilingual EP Solo and revisit Ms Nina and Tomasa del Real's song with a recent music video.
As always, as part of a series of NPR Music's favorite Latin songs , we created a Spotify playlist to accompany the songs we write about. Read and listen to the latest on Alt.Latino below .
Aventura, ""Inmortal"" Courtesy of the artist From the intro track that proudly proclaims ""Soy Dominicano,"" Romeo Santos' fourth album Utopia is a celebration of bachata. But the biggest draw to the album is that — after promising it with an artful nude and then unpromising it as an April Fools joke — Utopia delivers the first new Aventura song in 10 years since the band's last album in 2009. Far be it from us to be mad about the runaround, though. If there was any uncertainty about the utter madness Aventura inspires in its fans, Romeo settled it with this tease. In the video, Romeo is a lab creature under study, kept apart from the woman he loves by the scientists studying him. (The drama on her face throughout it is us when Romeo told us Aventura was back, then not back, then back.) — Stefanie Fernández
Jennifer Lopez feat. French Montana, ""Medicine"" Courtesy of the artist When first hearing ""Medicine,"" Jennifer Lopez 's latest unapologetic anthem, on shuffle, JLo's 2005 hit "" Get Right ,"" plays right after. The escapist, brass-heavy beat of ""Get Right"" leaves you riddled in a jumpy, head-bopping haze so, in a sense, it felt right for this Rebirth song would play following the equally brassy and infectious ""Medicine.""
The jazz-hop melody and layered brass and drum action ( and accompanying glammed-up music video ) of this new single makes for an empowering, timeless track that could easily find its place either on the tracklist of Rebirth or in today's day and age. — Jacqueline Reed
Anitta, Ludmilla, Snoop Dogg and Paptinho, ""Onda Diferente"" Courtesy of the artist On Kisses , Brazil's Anitta gives us 10 highly curated, highly produced hits in English, Spanish and Portuguese, a project she teased with the ambitious trilingual EP Solo in 2018. Driven to bring worldwide recognition to her music and her country, Anitta is a woman who won't be put into a box. The album features appearances ranging from trap kings DJ Luian and Mambo Kingz on "" Sin Miedo "" to Rae Sremmurd rapper Swae Lee on "" Poquito "" to beloved Brazilian songwriter and activist Caetano Veloso on the quiet ballad "" Você mentiu ."" Then there's the over-the-top, ridiculous-but-fun "" Banana "" with Becky G. Each song has a glitzy video to accompany it, like the beautiful "" Atención ,"" a supercut of diverse women getting ready and owning it in their bathrooms.
The album is so packed that an artist less precise than Anitta might have made it feel forced. Yet for all the experiments and languages in these songs, Anitta proves that she can still slay without straying from her native Portuguese on "" Onda Diferente ."" The track is baile funk at its core, with one big curveball from Snoop Dogg. ""I pay them boys a visit when I slip through them favelas,"" he says. It shouldn't work, but it does. — Stefanie Fernández
Lila Downs, ""Cariñito"" Courtesy of the artist Lila Downs has been making music that is both extremely popular and artistically exquisite for a while. And have you seen her Tiny Desk concert ? I often wonder what musicians with longevity do to keep things fresh. ""Cariñito"" is Exhibit A in how to go to the well and bring up something refreshing.
The song is a Peruvian cumbia classic and Downs has chosen ""The Man With The Golden Touch,"" Camilo Lara, to produce her upcoming album, due out May 3. The result is just what we expect from La Jefa but she has a musical spring in her step that comes from Lara's musical wisdom. He seems to know exactly will work with the bands he chooses to work with and for Lila Downs there is unbridled joy mixed in to the cumbia two step rhythms.
Downs released a statement about the album released with the single this week:
"" This new album is an homage to the chile. People often laugh and ask me if I'm serious! Yes, the music is a tribute to the fruit that causes us so much craving and suffering, but that we really love! We fry the chile, add beats from the city, then saxophones, trumpets and drums from the Mexican coast to keep the dance going. The village and the city are united by the same beat. With a mezcal in hand, we dream of a place with a palm tree where one falls in love and reflects .""
The name of Down's upcoming album is Al Chiles. — Felix Contreras"
Watch: Earth Gets Its First Look At A Black Hole : NPR,www.npr.org,Bill Chappell,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711723383/watch-earth-gets-its-first-look-at-a-black-hole,"Enlarge this image The first-ever image of a black hole was released Wednesday by a consortium of researchers, showing the ""black hole at the center of galaxy M87, outlined by emission from hot gas swirling around it under the influence of strong gravity near its event horizon."" Event Horizon Telescope collaboration et al Event Horizon Telescope collaboration et al The first-ever image of a black hole was released Wednesday by a consortium of researchers, showing the ""black hole at the center of galaxy M87, outlined by emission from hot gas swirling around it under the influence of strong gravity near its event horizon.""
Event Horizon Telescope collaboration et al The world is seeing the first-ever image of a black hole Wednesday, as an international team of researchers from the Event Horizon Telescope project released their look at the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy Messier 87 (M87). The image shows a dark disc ""outlined by emission from hot gas swirling around it under the influence of strong gravity near its event horizon,"" the consortium said.
""As an astrophysicist, this is a thrilling day for me,"" said National Science Foundation Director France A. Córdova.
The enormous black hole is some 55 million light-years from Earth in the Virgo galaxy cluster, with a mass some 6.5 billion times that of our sun.
""We are delighted to be able to report to you today that we have seen what we thought was unseeable. We have seen and taken a picture of a black hole,"" said EHT Director Shep Doeleman of Harvard University.
Researchers at the Event Horizon Telescope project say they were able to create an image of a black hole by using a network of eight radio telescopes to create ""a virtual telescope dish as large as the Earth itself,"" the National Science Foundation says .
The breakthrough, Doeleman said, came after a decade of work to align the myriad working parts of the project and gain the highest resolution possible from the Earth's surface. Finally, in April of 2017, he said, ""all of the dishes in the Event Horizon Telescope swiveled, turned and stared"" at the core of M87. From that data came the image that was released Wednesday.
Córdova and Doeleman led a news conference in Washington, D.C., to discuss the team's finding, in an synchronized process that took place simultaneously on four continents, as researchers held press conferences to share news of what they're calling ""a groundbreaking result.""
""You have probably seen many, many images of black holes before,"" said Heino Falcke, a professor in the Netherlands who chairs the EHT Science Council. ""But they were all simulations or animations. And this [image] is precious to all of us, because this one is finally real.""
National Science Foundation via YouTube Pointing to the screen at the European Research Council's news conference in Brussels, Falcke said that the much-sought-after image ""looks like a ring of fire. And it's actually created by the force of gravity, by the deformation of space-time, where light actually goes around the black hole, almost in a circle.""
Describing the image in Washington, Doeleman said, ""The bright patch in the south ... tells us that material moving around the black hole is moving at light speeds — which is also consistent with our simulations and predictions"" based on Albert Einstein's theories.
As for its broader implications, Doeleman said that by capturing the image of a supermassive black hole at the core of a bright galaxy, ""We now know clearly that black holes drive large-scale structure in the universe.""
""As with all great discoveries, this is just the beginning,"" he added, predicting the image would open new avenues for study and research.
The newly imaged black hole is some 100 billion kilometers across. But despite its massive size, anyone trying to find it in the night sky from the Earth's surface would face the same challenge if they stood in Brussels and wanted to see a mustard seed in Washington, Falcke said.
It's well-known that a black hole's gravity is so overpowering that even light cannot escape its center. But black holes also dramatically affect their surrounding space, most obviously by creating an accretion disk — the swirl of gas and material that rapidly orbits their singularities.
""Black holes are the X-games of physics. They represent an unexplored extreme of space-time,"" as astrophysicist Adam Frank wrote for NPR in 2017 . ""While we now have good indirect evidence that they exist, getting a direct view of a black hole is the ultimate dream for a lot of physicists.""
For years, a breakthrough in black hole detection promised to answer a question that has dogged scientists since Einstein proposed the existence of black holes in his general theory of relativity: How do you document the presence of something that's invisible?
As it answered that question, the EHT project team also published six research papers in The Astrophysical Journal , laying out their methodology and findings.

University of Arizona EHT telescopes are arrayed around the world, from Antarctica to Arizona and from Mexico to Spain. Before scientists can analyze data collected by the network, a painstaking process must take place. Each signal received by the telescopes must be synchronized wave by wave, using atomic clocks and a supercomputer to correlate and combine observations from around the world.
It takes many hours of observations to record enough data to create an image.
""Like a time-lapse exposure, this slowly builds up an image of even a very dim source,"" the NSF says. ""It also allows Earth's rotation to, in effect, fill in the empty spaces in the array to produce a more complete picture.""
In a few weeks of observing the black hole, the EHT project amassed 5 petabytes of data, which Dan Marrone of the University of Arizona said was equivalent to 5,000 years' worth of mp3 files — or ""the entire selfie collection over a lifetime for 40,000 people.""
The task of correlating huge amounts of data, sifting through noise, calibrating information and creating a usable image was a ""very significant"" part of the project, Marrone said.
""They deserve an enormous amount of credit for their diligence and dedication,"" Marrone said, ""because without it, we couldn't have made an image.""

— MIT CSAIL (@MIT_CSAIL) April 10, 2019 Some of that work took place in Massachusetts, at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, where computer scientist Katie Bouman ""led the creation of a new algorithm to produce the first-ever image of a black hole,"" the lab said Wednesday.
Bouman, who was a graduate student when she began working on the project, gave a TEDx Talk in late 2016 in which she discussed the challenge of using algorithms to ""piece together pictures from the sparse, noisy data"" from telescopes — without, she added, biasing the system to gravitate toward what scientists might expect a black hole to look like.
To ensure the final image's validity, the EHT project used a ""blind"" process, assigning four teams to spend seven weeks working independently to create an image based on data about the M87 black hole that was collected on April 11. When they compared the images , researchers found that all of them depicted a ""ring"" around the black hole that was roughly the same diameter, with a brighter segment in its southern arc.
YouTube To find a black hole massive enough to be potentially visible from an Earth-based telescope, Event Horizon researchers focused on ""supermassive"" black holes that are found at the centers of galaxies. The international collaboration decided to focus on the black hole at the center of galaxy M87 because of its gargantuan size and other characteristics.
""M87 is the nearest galaxy with a supermassive black hole that's generating a powerful jet — a beautiful streamer made of plasma travelling at close to the speed of light,"" said Charles Gammie, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who is on the EHT Science Council Board.
In a news release about the breakthrough , Gammie said: ""One of the great mysteries in astronomy has been how such jets are launched. Our simulations, which are based on the motion of magnetic fields and hot gas near the black hole, showed that the jets are powered by the black hole itself. Magnetic fields act to brake the rotation of the black hole and transfer its rotational energy to the jet.""
As they analyzed the image and related data, astronomers also grew increasingly confident with other assumptions they've made based on theories about the workings of the universe.
""Once we were sure we had imaged the shadow, we could compare our observations to extensive computer models that include the physics of warped space, superheated matter and strong magnetic fields. Many of the features of the observed image match our theoretical understanding surprisingly well,"" said Paul T.P. Ho, EHT board member and director of the East Asian Observatory.
He added, ""This makes us confident about the interpretation of our observations, including our estimation of the black hole's mass.""

CEOs Of Big Banks To Face Tough Questioning On Capitol Hill : NPR,www.npr.org,Jim Zarroli,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711732570/ceos-of-big-banks-to-face-tough-questioning-on-capitol-hill,"Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., told JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon his bank has been the subject of numerous complaints about overdraft fees, citing data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
""You're essentially gouging your most vulnerable clients, the ones that are living paycheck to paycheck,"" she said.
Dimon replied that bank customers can choose accounts that have different overdraft fee structures.
""The overdraft policy as it stands today, which was changed, by the way, in 2009, is that the client has to opt in,"" he said. ""They are given a choice on opening the account on whether they want to have overdraft features or not.""
Also testifying at the hearing were Bank of America's Brian Moynihan, David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley's James Gorman, State Street's Ronald O'Hanley and Charles Scharf of Bank of New York Mellon. Wells Fargo CEO Quits In Wake Of Consumer Financial Scandals
It's the first time bank CEOs have appeared before the committee since the Democratic takeover of Congress and the first joint appearance by the heads of all seven banks on Capitol Hill since the financial crash.
Perhaps in anticipation of Wednesday's hearing, Bank of America announced it would raise its minimum wage to $20 an hour by 2021.
Ranking member Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., accused Democrats of staging a political stunt and said the committee would be better focused on relevant issues like the impact of Brexit on the U.S. financial system.
""Why are we here?"" he asked. ""I fear our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are here to attack our economic system, attack the nature of our market. I fear my friends want to dictate social and environmental policy through government mandates on banks. That's not the right approach."" Bank Of America Raising Its Minimum Wage To $20 An Hour
McHenry questioned the CEOs about whether Britain's departure from the European Union without a firm plan in place would destabilize the global financial system.
Most said it would be a challenge but not a systemic risk. The heads of Citigroup and Bank of New York Mellon said they have already taken steps to relocate their British operations to other European countries in anticipation of a hard Brexit."

"Justice Department Accuses Maker Of Suboxone With Fraud, Conspiracy : NPR",www.npr.org,Rachel Martin,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711742397/justice-department-accuses-maker-of-suboxone-with-fraud-conspiracy,"Federal prosecutors charge British drug maker Indivior with felony fraud and conspiracy for its marketing of opioid addiction products including Suboxone.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Suboxone has been marketed as a treatment drug that helps people who are addicted to opioids. It actually contains opioids. It's designed to treat withdrawal symptoms. But federal prosecutors say the drug itself is prone to abuse. Late Tuesday, the Department of Justice charged Indivior, the maker of Suboxone, with fraud and conspiracy. Brian Mann is a reporter with North Country Public Radio. He reports on the opioid crisis, and he joins us now.
Brian, what exactly are prosecutors charging? We say fraud and conspiracy. What else can you tell us about the charges?
BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Yeah. They say this British company lied about the safety of Suboxone, claiming it was less prone to abuse. And the allegation here, really, is that Indivior's deceptive claims convinced a lot of health providers and insurers, like Medicare and Medicaid, to spend billions of dollars on their patented version of Suboxone rather than buying much cheaper, generic versions of the medication. An investigation by the Food and Drug Administration found Suboxone isn't actually safer. In fact, it may even be riskier in a lot of cases.
MARTIN: Which is really huge news because this was a drug that was seen to be a fix or at least something that was going to help people who were addicted to opioids, right?
MANN: Yeah. I mean, Suboxone is still widely used to treat people suffering from opioid dependency, prescription drugs and non-prescription opioids - designed to help with withdrawal symptoms and long-term maintenance. Medications like this are hugely important because so many Americans are addicted to opioids. But Suboxone itself contains opioids, and that means people sometimes abuse it too. And prosecutors say Indivior boosted profits illegally by setting up a system that connected people suffering from addiction with crooked doctors who were overprescribing Suboxone.
MARTIN: What's the company saying about these charges?
MANN: Well, they released a detailed rebuttal last night to these charges, saying the Justice Department is wrong on the science and on the facts. They say they've been an important and responsible player helping respond to the opioid crisis. Indivior promised they will - and this is their quote. They will ""contest this case vigorously. We look forward to the full facts coming out in court,"" they say.
MARTIN: Several states are already suing big drug companies for their role in the opioid epidemic. Why is the momentum catching right now?
MANN: Yeah, so this is just a huge health crisis. The Centers for Disease Control say more than 200,000 Americans have died from prescription opioid overdoses that began after these companies like Indivior began aggressively marketing these drugs - more than a hundred Americans still dying every day. And so what we're seeing is state attorneys general and now federal agencies beginning to demand that drug makers and distributors pay for some of the damage they've caused. Just last month, Purdue Pharma settled with the state of Oklahoma for $270 million. That company has started talking openly about filing for bankruptcy. And federal prosecutors say if Indivior is found guilty in this case, the company should forfeit $3 billion. And the promise, Rachel, is that a lot of that money will go to help with drug treatment for, you know, things like rehab programs and law enforcement.
MARTIN: Brian Mann with North Country Public Radio.
Thanks so much, Brian. We appreciate it.
MANN: Thank you.

A 14-Year-Old Oil Spill In The Gulf That No One Can Stop : NPR,www.npr.org,Tegan Wendland,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711085901/this-oil-spill-has-been-leaking-into-the-gulf-for-14-years,"Enlarge this image The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement are using Ian MacDonald's data to estimate the amount of oil being spilled at the Taylor Energy site.

toggle caption Tegan Wendland/WWNO The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement are using Ian MacDonald's data to estimate the amount of oil being spilled at the Taylor Energy site.
Tegan Wendland/WWNO Ten miles out in the Gulf of Mexico, off the tip of Louisiana, the fumes become overwhelming. ""See how it's all rainbow sheen there? So that's oil,"" says Ian MacDonald, who's guiding us in a tiny fishing boat that's being tossed around by 6-foot waves.
MacDonald is a scientist at Florida State University where he studies oil spills. This one is not a black, sticky slick, but it stretches on for miles. And here, where the murky Mississippi River dumps into the Gulf, it's been leaking for more than 14 years.
The Coast Guard has just begun to intervene to try and clean up this spill. But it faces challenges. And MacDonald sees the spill as a warning for regulators, just as the Trump administration pushes to expand offshore oil drilling in the Atlantic.
A hurricane, an oil rig, an underwater mudslide
The spill began in 2004, when Hurricane Ivan toppled an oil rig into the Gulf. The rig was owned by Taylor Energy, a New Orleans-based company, which managed to plug some of the 25 broken pipes, but the leak continued.
Jonathan Henderson runs an environmental nonprofit called Vanishing Earth and worries about the impact on marine life. ""Everything that lives and breathes in the Gulf of Mexico travels back and forth through that zone,"" he says. ""Fish, seabirds, turtles, dolphins.""
Everything that lives and breathes in the Gulf of Mexico travels back and forth through that zone.
Jonathan Henderson, Vanishing Earth
The government is studying the impact on marine life, but even they can't figure out exactly how much oil is leaking. Neither can the company.
Henderson has been trying to monitor it himself by doing regular flyovers and reporting what he sees. He's frustrated at the government's response. ""If we can put a man on the moon, we can figure out how to, like, grab oil that's coming up from the seafloor and 400 feet of water,"" he says.
The Department of the Interior and the Coast Guard have been working with the company to try to stop the leak for years, but it poses a major engineering challenge. The wells were buried under hundreds of feet of mud in an underwater mudslide, which are common in the area, where the mouth of the Mississippi has built up hundreds of feet of silt on the bottom of the ocean floor.
""This is a well-known, high-risk area,"" says Ed Richards, a law professor at Louisiana State University. He says it raises questions about offshore development. ""Should they have built the rig the way they built it? Should it have been permitted that way?""
Taylor Energy has spent about $500 million to try to stop the spill, and it's paying for pilots to fly over and monitor it. The company has reported less than a barrel of oil a day on the surface, but estimates vary widely.

Ian MacDonald visits the site of the Taylor Energy oil spill regularly. He's helping measure the size of the spill for the government. He estimates that about 100 barrels of oil are spilling into the Gulf each day, what he calls a sobering finding, ""and neither the government nor the responsible parties have been able to stop it, or even acknowledge that it really existed until now.""
MacDonald says the situation should serve as a warning to regulators as they attempt to expand oil and gas drilling in the Atlantic, where underwater canyons pose a threat to underwater infrastructure.
""The idea that we would be building in deep water, and making pipelines going back to land in an area that's susceptible to those kinds of accidents,"" he says, ""is something that we should take into account as we do our planning.""
But he worries that's not happening. The Trump administration has rolled back offshore safety rules, even as it works to open up more areas to drilling.
A giant containment dome
Earlier this year, the Coast Guard began hiring contractors to try to stop the spill by dropping a giant metal containment dome over the wells in order to collect the leaking oil. Taylor Energy says this could make the leak worse, so it has sued the Coast Guard.
Neither the government nor the company agreed to go on record, saying litigation is ongoing.
Back on the boat in the Gulf, MacDonald remains hopeful.
""I'm really glad to be out here and to see this operation,"" he says, "" because it's been a long time coming, and there's a lot riding on it.""
But he says it might be that no one is able to stop the oil from bubbling up into the Gulf. If that's the case, according to government estimates , the leak could go on for 100 more years."

Updated at 2:50 p.m. ET
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be on his way to a fourth consecutive term, and his main challenger has conceded defeat.
The election was neck and neck between his right-wing party and that of his top contender, centrist political newcomer Benny Gantz. But with at least 97 percent of the votes counted, Netanyahu appears to be in the best position to form a government because of the strength of other right-wing, nationalist and religious parties.
""We respect the decision of the people,"" Gantz said at a press conference on Wednesday evening.
Israeli voters were choosing between some 40 different candidate lists, representing parties, alliances and individuals. Netanyahu's Likud party and Gantz's Blue and White alliance each appear to have secured 35 seats.
Netanyahu and Gantz, a former military chief of staff, both declared victory shortly after the polls closed. But according to Haaretz , parties in the right-wing bloc total are poised to take 65 seats, eclipsing the 55 seats from the center-left bloc that would likely align with Gantz.
He and other leaders in his party have indicated that they will act as opposition to Netanyahu in parliament, rather than joining his coalition.
""We didn't win in this round. We will make Likud's life hell in the opposition,"" said Yair Lapid, another leader of the Blue and White alliance, according to Reuters.
On Wednesday, Gantz wrote this message to his supporters, according to the Associated Press: ""Our voters asked for hope and we gave it to them. They wanted a different way and we outlined it.""
Israel's president, Reuven Rivlin, is charged with declaring which candidate will have the first opportunity to try to put together a government. He's set to meet with party leaders for their nominations, and he's announced that those meetings will be broadcast live to ""ensure transparency for Israel's citizens.""
In the final days of the campaign, Netanyahu has vowed to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank — a move that would quash any remaining hopes of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
As NPR's Daniel Estrin reported, Palestinian official Saeb Erekat saw Netanyahu's victory as a sign that the occupation was far from over.
""They want their occupation to be endless, and they want us to live under a continued deeper apartheid system than the one that existed in the darkest hours of South Africa's apartheid,"" Erekat said.
One major complicating factor for Netanyahu is that he is accused of corruption and could face indictment for bribery and other charges. The allegations are related to allegedly accepting gifts from wealthy businessmen and allegedly conspiring with media moguls to trade favors in exchange for positive coverage.
If indicted, ""it could spell the beginning of the end for Netanyahu. Because there are questions here — will all the parties in such a Netanyahu government stand by his side?"" Estrin reported . ""Will Netanyahu's own party start preparing for the day after and maybe even hold a leadership contest within the party?""
He added: ""This could be Netanyahu's shortest term if he does indeed secure the government."""
GitHub Is Now Where China's Tech Workers Vent Outside Reach Of Censors : NPR,www.npr.org,Emily Feng,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/709490855/github-has-become-a-haven-for-chinas-censored-internet-users,"Enlarge this image Created by Chinese programmers, 996.ICU has become a popular repository of workers' rights campaign materials on the website GitHub. The name is a play on a refrain that long work hours of 9 to 9, six days a week, could send tech workers to the intensive care unit. 996.ICU/Screenshot by NPR 996.ICU/Screenshot by NPR Created by Chinese programmers, 996.ICU has become a popular repository of workers' rights campaign materials on the website GitHub. The name is a play on a refrain that long work hours of 9 to 9, six days a week, could send tech workers to the intensive care unit.
996.ICU/Screenshot by NPR China is remarkably successful at scrubbing its Internet of social dissent. Twitter and Facebook have been blocked ever since deadly ethnic riots in 2009. Chinese social media platforms employ armies of internal censors to take down posts, images and even emoji.
But this month, coordinated dissent has popped up in an unexpected place: GitHub, the world's largest open-source site that lets programmers collaborate on code. (GitHub is owned by Microsoft, which is an NPR funder.)
China's beleaguered tech workers have deluged GitHub in the past month with thousands of posts protesting ""996"" schedules — 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week — and demanding better working conditions.
Tech-savvy programmers in the world's most thoroughly censored cyberspace are turning to unconventional means to collectively organize. They created a ""repository,"" or collaborative project, on GitHub called ""996.ICU,"" based on a joke that a 996 schedule will send you to the intensive care unit. It's become one of the most popular projects on GitHub, with more than 200,000 GitHub members following the project.
""First they came after my two breaks. Then they came after my remaining break. Then we had 996,"" one GitHub programmer wrote in Chinese on the 996.ICU page last month.
The viral GitHub campaign puts Beijing in a tight spot: How do you keep China's Internet just free enough to enable economic development without opening the door to protest?
""GitHub has always presented something of a dilemma because the service is so successful in how developers use it to share code and share software. If you cut off China from it, it can present genuine problems for developers and for tech firms,"" said James Griffiths, the author of The Great Firewall of China .
The site's role as an influential platform for creating and sharing anti-censorship software tools within China has made it a target before. It was briefly blocked within China in 2013. Then in 2015, GitHub was briefly taken offline by a DDoS attack, or distributed denial of service — the largest recorded at the time — from servers later traced back to Chinese state telecom giant China Unicom. Access to certain pages and projects have been selectively disrupted.
But for now, GitHub remains accessible in China.
Over the past decade, Chinese authorities have systematically cut off other tools used to coordinate collective action, such as Twitter, WhatsApp and even Instagram. Popular domestic platforms, such as Tencent's WeChat app and the Twitter-like Sina Weibo, are increasingly monitored.
""Other groups have not been able to have their concerns raised as prominently as we have. This is because normal Chinese media and social media platforms are heavily censored by the Chinese government and so their information cannot be shared to the public,"" a 996 programmer who goes by the alias Deleted Account tells NPR.
Despite his involvement through GitHub, the programmer said he was ""scared to death"" of political retribution: ""I am not optimistic about our long-term prospects. I think the Chinese Communist Party will see us as terrorists and use the most modern weaponry to make us obey.""
The 996 campaigners face risks in their efforts for better working conditions. In the past year, labor activists in China have encountered a new wave of suppression. More than 30 students, activists and factory workers are still being held incommunicado after they were detained last summer for trying to unionize factory workers.
Asia In China, The Communist Party's Latest, Unlikely Target: Young Marxists This year, local authorities arrested eight more labor advocates across China, including three editors at a well-known labor rights website.
But the campaigners insist their campaign is not political. They simply want companies to follow existing labor laws, which limit work schedules to 44 hours a week.
So far, they say smaller companies are receptive.
""The response has been really radical,"" says Suji Yan, a Shanghai-based programmer. Last month, he and his wife, Katt Gu, designed a free software license for the 996.ICU GitHub campaign that lets companies signal they follow labor laws.
""A lot of small and medium companies started to put all their work in the anti-996 license to show that they are a good company and they respect the law and peoples' lives. ... It's all happened in the last 48 hours [of putting up the license] and it's all going very fast.""
The original GitHub 996 project has now spawned regional meetup groups in southern China, where many tech companies have offices, as well as offshoot chat groups for specific tech sectors.
Organizers also have crowdsourced an employers ""blacklist"" containing dozens of companies that they say have illegally forced employees to work more than 70 hours a week and written petitions to Chinese government ministries, including the state labor union.
""In the future, we hope that this project is not just a group for 996 programmers. We hope that it can become a place where all software workers come to together and organize in order to strive for their labor rights and interests,"" said Victor Xu, a GitHub contributor.
The growing 996 project on GitHub may place Microsoft, which has significant business interests in China, in a tough spot. It has introduced a software suite tailored for Chinese government use. It also owns LinkedIn , the only major Western social media platform accessible in China, which frequently blocks content and accounts in China deemed politically sensitive.
Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment.
""It remains to be seen if the government does make a request for Microsoft to take down these projects ... and whether Microsoft will be willing to play ball,"" Griffiths said. ""This could be a really important test for Microsoft and for GitHub."""

Airbnb will allow listings in the occupied West Bank — again.
On Tuesday, the property rental company reversed a previous decision to remove about 200 listings in Israeli settlements in the area.
Now, the company says it will allow settlement properties to be listed, and will donate all the money it makes from those properties to non-profit humanitarian aid organizations ""that serve people in different parts of the world.
""We have always sought to bring people together and will continue to work with our community to achieve this goal,"" said Airbnb in a statement , adding that it has never boycotted Israel.
The company said it will apply this donation model to other disputed territories in the world, like South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Arvind Ganesan, a director at Human Rights Watch, called the company's reversal ""disappointing"" and suggested its offer to donate profits falls short.
""By continuing to do business in settlements, they remain complicit in the abuses settlements trigger,"" said Ganesan.
The rights group said in a post to Twitter last November that it has been pushing Airbnb to leave the West Bank for two years.
Airbnb's decision came after the company said it had ""settled all lawsuits"" brought by potential clients who objected to the company's initial decision to bar listings.
The company was sued in U.S. federal court by 12 U.S.-Israeli citizens with homes in the settlements, the Associated Press reported .
In November, NPR reported that Israel's minister of strategic affairs, Gilad Erdan, had encouraged people affected by the policy to file lawsuits against Airbnb.
""As a provider of a service to the public, Airbnb is not permitted to refuse to provide services to selected religious groups to engineer who it thinks should be allowed to live where,"" Robert Tolchin, an attorney for the plaintiffs told AP. "

Guillem Sartorio/Getty Images Guillem Sartorio/Getty Images Workers repair the roof of a small shop while a woman hangs clothing to dry among debris in Beira, Mozambique. The city was badly damaged after Cyclone Idai hit on March 14.
Guillem Sartorio/Getty Images Daviz Simango, mayor of Beira, Mozambique, thought that his coastal city was prepared for cyclones.
In 2012, the city built a new drainage system and wave barriers with $120 million from the World Bank. The idea was to help Beira withstand the rising seas and increased storms that experts predict will accompany global climate change.
Then Cyclone Idai hit.
The storm, which slammed into the coast of Mozambique on March 14, was devastating. It claimed at least 847 lives in the region, displaced tens of thousands, and created an inland sea from flooding that measured about 80 miles long and 15 miles wide.
Beira was especially affected. The once-bustling port, home to about half a million people, was badly damaged by high winds and flooding. Approximately 90 percent of the city's infrastructure was destroyed by the storm. It raised a question for Simango: why weren't the city's preparations enough?
NPR's Ari Shapiro spoke with Simango to discuss the aftermath of the storm and how Beira plans to rebuild. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Cara Anna/AP How did Cyclone Idai affect Beira?
Roofs, houses, schools, hospitals, businesses, were all destroyed by high winds. Our coasts — which have a lot of protective infrastructure like wave breaks and walls — were all destroyed. Roads as well, so many downed trees. We spent a few days without power, no communication, without clean water. It was a really terrible situation.
What does your city look like today?
Now, we've started to rebuild. Life is coming back to the city. I'm beginning to see people in the street walking, driving. The market is waking, business is ongoing. But [rebuilding] will take a long time.
You oversaw the construction of a massive drainage system under the city to prepare for storms like this. Why wasn't that enough to prevent the cyclone from destroying the city?
Beira was prepared for the flooding. We have a good drainage system that worked, but we were not prepared for the wind. Wind damaged everything.
Goats and Soda In Need Of Blankets, Pain Killers, Pill Refills: Life After Cyclone Idai Most of the buildings here are built to withstand [75 miles-per-hour] winds, but the winds brought by Idai were much higher.
What lessons do you take from this?
The lesson we take is maybe we have to do better homework. Study how to deal with [multiple aspects of] climate change. We focused on one [aspect] which was flooding. Now we need to think about wind, too. We need to build more resilient houses against wind, and map out vulnerable areas [to inform] where to build and where not to build.
What is Beira's most pressing need right now?
When you have these kinds of disasters — flooding, raining, wind — at the end of the day you have different types of rubbish. If you keep rubbish and water together, the people will be drinking bad water. We're advising people on the dangers of untreated water.
So we need drinking water and sanitation. After that, we need to be clear that mosquitoes will come . We've done well against cholera with vaccinations, but we need to protect ourselves against malaria, too.
Is your city getting the support it needs from the international community?
So far yes, we've had support from the international community which is playing an important role on the ground. But what will happen if they go? What's going to happen in Beira as we try to rebuild?
How are you personally holding up through all of this?
Goats and Soda Cyclone Idai: A Town Is Haunted By The Smell Of Death I'm a public worker, I have to do my duty. I was elected and the people see me as a leader. I have to use my leadership to deal with everything that's happening here. We're trying our best, and I hope the people remember what we've been doing. It's most important to keep hope and know that together we can rebuild this city.
What was it like for you the day the cyclone hit?
My grandmom was at the hospital on the 14th. It was flooding in her room so I had to take her out [of the hospital] and bring her somewhere safe. At that time I was worried she'd die in my arms, but she did quite well and she's still living."

Devan Schwartz for NPR Devan Schwartz for NPR Tom DiGiovanni's job as chief financial officer for Canndescent involves managing bags of cash by the millions which must be counted, then hauled in armored vehicles.
Devan Schwartz for NPR Normally, a chief financial officer's job involves poring over balance sheets and bank statements. But in the pot business, the job still bears a lot of similarities to the illicit trade — transporting loads of cash under the watchful eye of big guys carrying lots of guns.
Just ask Tom DiGiovanni.
This chief financial officer and former Ernst & Young accountant leans into an unmarked armored van where there's a metal cage to protect the revenues for his company, Canndescent, from would-be thieves.
The Salt Haute Pot: How High-End California Chefs Are Cashing In On Marijuana ""Over the course of a month, we probably have $2 million in cash that's in some state of transit,"" he says. By the end of the year, that's expected to top $4 million, which will mean more armored vans and heavily armed guards.
""They have an ankle holster and another one in the small of their back and they're wearing tactical gear,"" DiGiovanni says. ""It's pretty crazy.""
DiGiovanni looks like he could be Ray Liotta's brother, with a nightclub bouncer's build. He says he likes living on the edge — at least businesswise. That's good, since aspects of his job feel more akin to gangster than pencil pusher.
Marijuana is legal medically or recreationally in 34 states, but it's still illegal under federal law. And though many businesses have entered that new gray market, the financial services industry has not. No major U.S. banks will open accounts for a company like Canndescent or its retail clients.
Enlarge this image Banks won't lend to the cannabis industry, so much of the money Canndescent used to build its 27,000-square-foot grow house came from friends and family of the owner. Devan Schwartz for NPR Devan Schwartz for NPR Banks won't lend to the cannabis industry, so much of the money Canndescent used to build its 27,000-square-foot grow house came from friends and family of the owner.
Devan Schwartz for NPR Last month, the House Financial Services Committee advanced legislation that would authorize banks to serve the cannabis industry .
Anti-cannabis groups oppose the bill, and legalization generally. They argue the legal trade is a threat to public health that outweighs the tax benefits.
The measure has 157 bipartisan co-sponsors so far. But until it passes the full House and Senate, every aspect of DiGiovanni's job will be fraught with added risk and costs — from getting insurance, to paying employees, to filing taxes.
The estimated 300 U.S. financial institutions that serve the pot industry are small, state-chartered banks or credit unions. They're audited frequently, and transactions are monitored closely for suspicious activity. A cannabis business pays thousands in monthly fees just to have an account.
Code Switch What John Boehner's Pivot On Cannabis Tells Us About The Legal Weed Boom After scouring the state looking for a credit union to work with, DiGiovanni found one willing to deposit his marijuana revenue. But about every week, he gets calls from retail clients looking for a way to bank, because their accounts were shut down.
Banks also won't lend to the industry because if the federal government were to seize a company's assets, the lender would have nothing to collect on the loan.
DiGiovanni says the risk of that is extremely low. Yet that fear makes everything harder to access. He's been turned down by payroll companies, human-resource software firms and insurance brokers.
And, because of the extra risk, everything costs more. Canndescent invested $200,000 in an automated weighing machine that makes packaging six times faster, for example. The interest rate was 18 percent, or nearly three times the normal rate.
Enlarge this image Canndescent grows and sells premium pot to retailers throughout California. Most of them pay for the goods in cash. Devan Schwartz for NPR Devan Schwartz for NPR Canndescent grows and sells premium pot to retailers throughout California. Most of them pay for the goods in cash.
Devan Schwartz for NPR Two years ago, an infection destroyed Canndescent's hydroponic beds of seedlings. But crop insurance wasn't available for marijuana, so the company ate the $600,000 loss.
Most financing for cannabis businesses come from individual investors. Canndescent built its 27,000-square-foot grow house in Desert Hot Springs, Calif., largely with money from friends and family of the founder.
Meanwhile, sales keep growing, which means dealing with the headache of handling more cash — most of it in $20 bills. Counting all of that money is a pain, and it's heavy. DiGiovanni employs workers to do just that.
Business Cannabis Producer Gets $4 Billion Investment From Beer Company ""It's three or four hours a day that they're standing in front of that machine, feeding cash into it,"" he says. And it must be counted three times, at an undisclosed location, after every transfer — a process we're not allowed to see. ""It gets transported again on a random schedule to our processing facility, which is in a different city that I won't name,"" he says.
Safety is one primary argument in favor of legalizing banking for the industry, says Alyson Martin, co-founder of news site Cannabis Wire.
""Because these are essentially cash-only businesses, they become sitting ducks for robberies, thefts and those sorts of things,"" she says.
Business As More States Legalize Marijuana, Investors And Marketers Line Up Banking is the industry's biggest challenge, she says. ""I don't think I've talked to anybody who hasn't had banking headaches.""
DiGiovanni says he thinks the legislation will eventually pass and that will change things for the company. He says better access to banks would help him grow the business faster and hire more. And, in the long run, raise even more tax revenue for the government. But until then, he'll continue moving piles of cash about in bulletproof vans under a blanket of secrecy.

HBO ""When you play the game of thrones,"" Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) told Ned Stark (Sean Bean) icily — but of course she says everything icily — ""you win ... or you die.""
Foreshadowing? To say the least. More like fiveshadowing.
Because she said that to him way back in the seventh episode of Game of Thrones ' very first season. It was May 2011, years before the show would become the inescapable international phenomenon it has, and two episodes before it would set itself firmly down the path to becoming just that, by killing off its nominal main hero, Ned Stark.
Since that time, over the course of seven seasons, Cersei has been proven exactly right, again and again. There's been some small amount of winning, here and there, but just really a tremendous lot of dying — characters big and small, both the beloved and the benighted, have been poisoned, beheaded, slashed, gashed, stabbed, devoured by hounds, hurled from parapets, immolated, head-squished, pincushioned by arrows and — in one case — even died of old age, if you can imagine anything so grotesque.
Pop Culture Happy Hour 'Game Of Thrones' Season 7 Finale: 'We've Been Here For Some Time' Now that we're entering the home stretch — just six episodes left, which will clock in at an estimated seven hours and twenty minutes, total — all the series' disparate storylines are crashing together, which can be depended upon to send its body count soaring.
So let's make some predictions.
Read: Wild guesses.
These predictions are not based on anything but gut instinct. Nothing remotely spoilery lurks beneath them. Not knowledge gleaned from a close reading of the books, or from leaked on-set scuttlebutt, or anything, really, but a recent re-watch — and a reasonable understanding of how narrative arcs generally play out.
Let's take the likely deaths in piecemeal fashion, because they tend to slot into discrete categories.

Jaime Lannister — He's come a long way, baby, and though from a story perspective it feels like he needs to see Cersei one last time before he dies, I suspect his end will come sooner. Maybe he ends up saving the life of Bran, the kid he sent plummeting from a tower? Nah, that's too tidy, but I don't see the Kingslayer making it out of season eight alive. Brienne of Tarth — A beloved character, whose entire being is dedicated to honor, nobility and goodness. On Game of Thrones . No, yeah, she's doomed. Theon Greyjoy — Another character whose long, grisly redemption storyline is finally over, which is great. Not so great: That means there's nothing left for him to do, dramatically, but to die saving his sister Yara. Davos Seaworth -- Look, I hope he makes it. And there's a good chance he might, better than anyone else in this category. After all, he's not a fighter, he's the kind of character the show seems to favor — the loyal, canny, good-hearted advisor. But there are big battles coming. Grey Worm -- He's a soldier. In war, soldiers die. And for the producers to really sell the tremendous human cost of the battles to come, they'll need to show us more than hordes of faceless Unsullied and Dothraki getting mowed down. They'll need to put a face on it — and show us Missandei, grieving his loss. Bran Stark -- Not sure about this one. But Bran's spent the last couple seasons as a living, breathing Encylopedia Westerosi, imparting crucial information for the other characters to act on. There doesn't seem to be a lot left for him to reveal. And the fact that he was marked by the Night King bodes, you know, just all kinds of ill. Gendry -- Admit it, it would be just like this show to bring Gendry back after so long away, throw him into battle and have him like trip on a rock and die. He's Robert Baratheon's son, after all. The Deaths Foretold:
These are the characters who've been set up — either by in-show prophecy, or just the simple, implacable demands of storytelling — to totally eat it, at some point in season eight.
Melisandre — She said it herself. She's coming back to Westeros to die. Take the woman at her word. Varys -- You too, Big V, I'm afraid. Melisandre said your number would come up, too, and this show wants us to place a great deal of stock in its mystic pronouncements. I just hope we find out what that mysterious voice was that Varys said he heard from the flames on the day he was made a eunuch. It's come up twice, over the course of the series, and actor Conleth Hill made a meal of it, both times, so let's hope it pays off. (I do not think it will pay off.) Arya Stark — This one's controversial, because there's no in-continuity prophecy about Arya dying — there's just, you know, the show. The producers want us to thrill at Arya's badassery, but also wring our hands over her lethal, ruthless nature. I'm calling it: At some crucial moment she'll be forced to choose between crossing a name off her list — a big one (Cersei?), or choosing mercy. She'll choose the list, dooming herself. But she'll look great while she does so. Beric Dondarrion — He's been brought back for a purpose, we are assured. That purpose has got to be destroying the Night King. Once that mission is over, so is he. Jon Snow — I know, I know, one true heir to the Iron Throne, etc. etc. Doesn't matter. It's the Dondarrion rule: He's been brought back for a purpose and he'll accomplish that purpose. It'd be great if he could then retire to the Summer Islands with whatever the Lotus Port equivalent of a mai-tai might be, but that's not how this works, that's not how any of this works. Favorite Sessions Ramin Djawadi, 'Game Of Thrones Main Title' (Live) The Just Deserts:
These are the series' most hissable remaining villains; rest assured, not a one of them is gonna make it. Sure, the show's allowed their cruelty to thrive for multiple seasons, in most cases — but here at the end, justice has to find them.
The Night King — He's a force of nature, he's blue-eyed soullessness, he's Death itself, sporting a bunch of teensy ice-cowlicks. More importantly, as we learned last season, killing him means killing every White Walker, and by extension, every wight, instantly. That's ... tidy. The show wouldn't have built that failsafe mechanism unless it intended to use it. Queen Cersei* — She doesn't seem the sort to surrender amicably, and the show's not about to let her. She's done too much, she's gone too far. Winter (maybe Arya!) is coming for her. (That asterisk by her name refers to the fact that Cersei is also a proud member of Deaths Foretold category, as she was also the subject of a death-prophecy. So she's gonna get twice as killed as everyone else.) The Mountain -- Cleganebowl will see everyone's favorite reanimated corpse (non-wight variety) going down. Qyburn — This guy's exactly the sort of creepy toady the series will delight in preparing a particularly nasty demise for. Euron Greyjoy — This cartoonishly cruel, one-note, bargain-basement pirate — Captain Jackass Sparrow — will go down , and go down hard . Probably at the hands of Yara. And it won't be nearly as surprising as the show wants it to be, because he's not so much a nuanced, believable villain as a plot device in guy-liner and leather pants. The Stakes-Raisers:
I dearly hope everyone in this category makes it through. I'd like to think the series will rise above the pernicious tendency to kill or abuse secondary characters (usually women) in order to inspire hero characters (usually men) into taking action. I'd like to think it won't happen. But then, I've seen the show.
Gilly --Part of me thinks they wouldn't dare, because it's such a hack, obvious, tired cliche. But if they (wrongly) think they need to justify Sam leaping into heroic action, Gilly's a goner. Missandei -- Similarly, Missandei's the kind of character — smart, kind, gentle, warm — that could all too easily get fed into the sausage grinder of the show's producers, if they want to give us a sequence of an outraged Grey Worm rallying the troops. (Note: Either Grey Worm or Missandei will die — not both. One must remain alive to have us register the loss.) Podrick -- If they want Tyrion or Brienne to get their vengeance on, they'll kill off Pod. Shots - Health News 'Game Of Thrones' Finds Fans Among Disability Rights Activists, Too The Safe As (Westeros) Houses:
These are the characters who will make it through, bloodied, beaten but unbowed.
Tyrion Lannister — Don't get me wrong, it would be just like GRRM to off his most identifiable character (and most identifiable- with character, if you're one of his legions of ""bookish-nerd-who-can't-fight"" readers) at the last possible second, just when victory is at hand. But I see Tyrion making it through, barely. He's coming off two seasons as a pretty lousy strategic adviser, so let's close off that career path. Maybe he'll get that vineyard he always wanted. Samwell Tarly -- Well someone 's got to stick around to write A Song of Ice and Fire (see above, re: characters with whom the author and his readers most closely identify). He dropped out of maester school, and, what, he's gonna go back to Castle Black to be a Watcher On The Rubble? I don't think so. After last season's Friar's Club Roast of his father and older brother (more like ""Fryer's Club Roast"" good night Cleveland) the family seat at Horn Hill is ... kind of super super open. Daenerys Targaryen — It's what the series has been setting us up for, all along: Young woman comes into her power, learns how to wield it with wisdom, compassion and restraint (or else what the hell was that interminable Meereen business for?), experiences huge losses, and ultimately assumes her rightful place. (Forget Jon Snow — his status as the ""true heir"" means he would simply continue the cycle, and that's not how the show will send us out.) And yes, on one level, Daenerys assuming the Iron Throne would also represent a return to the status quo. Except it won't — all those references to how she wants to ""break the wheel,"" to say nothing of the fact that the Wall is down, means that there won't be any status quo to return to. There also likely won't be an Iron Throne on which to sit. (Dragon fire forged the Iron Throne in the first place — fitting if it also destroyed it, once and for all.) I'd love for the show to legitimately surprise us, and having Dany assume power in some new, unlooked-for way would do that. Bronn — There are survivors, and then there are cockroaches. Bronn would find some way to survive, even if the Night King won — he'd wrap himself in rotting entrails and stagger around going ""Argh, argh, got any mead argh, argh, argh."" This guy rolls with any punch; he'll be fine. Sansa Stark -- In the books, she's an ancillary character, but the show's made her central, and put her through hell. She'll make it. She better . Lyanna Mormont — After forcing us to watch Shireen Baratheon go up in flames, I suspect the show's appetite for killing young women — especially fan favorites like the bluntly badass Lady of Bear Island — has been sated. Yara Greyjoy -- She'll assume her rightful place as the Queen of the Iron Islands, having kicked her worthless Uncle Euron to the briny curb. The Hound — Tough call. He could very likely die in Cleganebowl, because he's already been through a whole ""almost dies, turns away from violence, whoops, nope, just kidding HACK SLASH KILL"" arc. Doubtful they'd do that again. They've put in so much work supplying him with added layers over and above his need for revenge, I hope they'll let him live to explore them. There you have it. Again, wild guesses, all. I'll be recapping this final season of Game of Thrones here at NPR.org, so we'll have six opportunities to bask in my wrongness. I'll write them overnight, so check for them on Monday mornings, first thing.

23 Thoroughbred Deaths Force Santa Anita To Change. Will The Racing Industry Follow?,www.npr.org,Tom Goldman,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711726633/23-thoroughbred-deaths-force-santa-anita-to-change-will-the-racing-industry-foll,"Enlarge this image Horses and jockeys charge toward the finish of a race on Santa Anita Derby day. The Derby was the most prominent event on a schedule that included 11 horse races. Tom Goldman/NPR Tom Goldman/NPR Horses and jockeys charge toward the finish of a race on Santa Anita Derby day. The Derby was the most prominent event on a schedule that included 11 horse races.
Tom Goldman/NPR The famed horse racing track, Santa Anita Park, is up and running after being closed for much of last month following a spike in racehorse deaths. Since the end of December 2018, 23 thoroughbreds have died — mostly due to injuries from racing or training. The fatalities have forced the horse racing industry, and the public, to take a hard look at the sport and some of the issues that have been debated for years: Are the economics of horse racing taking priority over the animals' health and welfare? Should racehorses be medicated and, if so, how much?
In mid-March, U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill aimed at improving horse-racing safety by requiring a uniform anti-doping and medication control program. Medicating thoroughbreds has been a long-running controversy in the U.S. — some medications mask symptoms which critics say can lead to catastrophic horse injuries. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has assigned investigators to work with the California Horse Racing Board to try to figure what's caused the Santa Anita deaths.
Amid the heightened scrutiny, and concerns about the racing industry's future, Santa Anita held one of its major events of the year this past weekend.
""The Great Race Place""
At last Saturday's Santa Anita Derby, it was easy to see why the track, founded in 1934, is nicknamed ""The Great Race Place."" From the grandstand along the stretch, it was a visual feast. A bright blue California sky, the San Gabriel Mountains just beyond the Park, and muscular thoroughbreds rumbling by on the dirt track.
Beneath this appealing, festive scene, though, there was anxiety among those connected to the track. Their mantra in the days leading up had been, ""just get through Saturday."" After 23 thoroughbred deaths, Santa Anita certainly didn't want another . Not on a day when NBC would broadcast the Derby, an important prep race for the Kentucky Derby next month.
Top jockey Joel Rosario was focused on his racing, but still aware of the bigger issue.
""Hopefully everything goes nice [and] smooth,"" Rosario said after finishing a race early in the day. ""[Hopefully] we don't have any problem.""
Apprehension in the stands
Steve Bazela was among the more than 30,000 paying and gambling customers at Santa Anita on Saturday. He's been coming to the track since the 1960s. He certainly didn't want to see what he saw just a week before. The catastrophic injury to a thoroughbred named Arms Runner — the most recent horse to die.

Benoit Photo/AP Benoit Photo/AP Jockey Mike Smith celebrates aboard Roadster, trained by Bob Baffert, after their victory in the Grade I, $1 million Santa Anita Derby horse race last Saturday.
Benoit Photo/AP ""All you got to do is see that once or twice in your life and it changes you,"" Bazela said. ""I saw a horse break down at the finish line about eight years ago [at Santa Anita]. I just literally walked to the parking lot I was so upset. I mean, they give you everything they've got.""
Bazela is 65 and still loves the sport. But he did say the incident made him more aware of ""why this is such a dangerous game. And it's not just the horses. The jockeys get on these horses and their lives are at stake.""
""We needed a lift""
The big race of the day, the Santa Anita Derby, didn't disappoint. Horses trained by hall-of-fame trainer Bob Baffert finished 1-2 and qualified for the Kentucky Derby.
Baffert, the face of horse racing in this country, was thrilled and grateful so many fans turned out and got to see an entire day of injury free racing.
""We needed a lift,"" Baffert said. ""I know I did.""
Catastrophic injuries happen in horse racing, but these spikes in deaths are not the norm. Baffert warned against over-reacting.
""You don't have to burn the house down just because the pipes are bad,"" he said, adding, ""we're going to work through this. But I really think the weather, really, caused a lot of this.""
You don't have to burn the house down just because the pipes are bad ... We're going to work through this.
Trainer Bob Baffert
Baffert's not wrong. In January and February, southern California got a ton of rain. It affected the multi-layered dirt track at Santa Anita and posed a potential risk to the massive horses who need those layers just right in order to protect their legs.
But, a prominent California equine veterinarian says you can't just blame the rain.
""Frankly, we shouldn't have run on some of the days that we had a bad track,"" says Dr. Rick Arthur. ""And some of the days when the track wasn't as good as it should've been, trainers shouldn't have trained their horses.""
Arthur is the equine medical director at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the the University of California, Davis. He also advises the California Horse Racing Board on veterinary practices, drug testing and health and welfare issues.
He's been based at Santa Anita for more than four decades. Arthur says those decisions to race and train horses when the track wasn't in good shape, are driven by a reality that goes beyond Santa Anita to many of this country's race tracks. Where the focus, he says, is more on economics than horses.
That, he says, is horse racing's real problem.
National Why Have 21 Horses Died At A California Racetrack Since December? ""Racing has become more competitive over a period of time,"" says Arthur. ""Horses are worked faster and there are fewer horses to fit the slots that are available. So there's more pressure on the horses to race more frequently.""
Getting the horse racing industry — track managers, owners, trainers — to embrace the ideas of less racing and more rest for the horses is going to take a culture change, Arthur says. But he adds if that doesn't happen, and horses keep dying at higher rates, there's a unanimous belief in what will happen.
""If we don't make racing safer,"" he says, ""I don't think the public's going to allow us to continue the sport.""
Regulating medication
A more immediate, and perhaps easier fix to make racing safer is restricting use of medications for race horses. It's been a hugely controversial issue over the years and critics of over-medication point to what they call a more humane and effective use of drugs by the international racing industry.
Recent changes at Santa Anita put the track more in line with international standards. The California Horse Racing Board approved proposals by track owner, the Stronach Group, to ban medications given to horses on the day they race – medications that can mask symptoms and thereby put the horse in danger of injuring itself.
Enlarge this image Animal rights activists protest horse racing deaths outside Santa Anita Park on March 10. Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images Animal rights activists protest horse racing deaths outside Santa Anita Park on March 10.
Mario Tama/Getty Images The 125-year-old Jockey Club, which registers all thoroughbreds in the U.S., supports the changes, and put out its own white paper in late March. The paper calls for comprehensive reform in the U.S. horse racing industry, and also focuses on medications and drug testing.
Jockey Club Executive Director Matt Iuliano says his organization published a document in 2011 calling for reform of racing medication rules. It was similar to the new white paper.
""We think the time is even more ripe now [for reform],"" says Iuliano. It's something we should all worry about and make us have a singular focus. How do we improve the health and safety of that [horse]?""
What's different now
The last fatality in the spate of Santa Anita horse deaths, was on March 31. The weather now is warm and Dr. Rick Arthur says the track is in great shape. Along with the new rules on medication, more veterinarians have been dispatched to watch horses during training sessions. Even the industry's harshest critic, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, praises the ownership group's action.
""As tragic as it sounds, it's a good thing [the spike of horse deaths] happened here,"" says PETA Senior Vice President Kathy Guillermo. ""Where the company that owns the track is trying to make something of a difference.""
Guillermo says her organization started working on the issue of horse racing deaths a decade ago, but now senses people outside the industry are more aware.
""What's different now,"" she says, ""is we have a public that's intolerant of abuse. So it's getting so much more attention. It's long overdue.""
With the Kentucky Derby less than a month away, Guillermo says PETA is shifting its focus to Churchill Downs. Late last month, the Louisville Courier Journal described that famed racetrack as one of the deadliest in the U.S.
Guillermo said in a statement this week, ""PETA is putting Kentucky on notice. No horses died during Santa Anita Derby weekend, which seems to show the track's new rules – while not as strong as PETA would have liked — are a lifesaving step. Churchill Downs has the second worst death rate for horses in the country. Change is overdue. It needs to come now.""
All those breathing a sigh of relief at Santa Anita know, however, it could be short lived. Until the next catastrophic horse injury.
On the way out of the track this weekend, a visitor wished a steward good luck for the rest of this season. A steward enforces the racing rules at Santa Anita.
""Thanks,"" she said. ""We need all the good thoughts we can get."""
Confused By Your College Financial Aid Letter? You're Not Alone,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/642287824/confused-by-your-college-financial-aid-letter-you-re-not-alone,"McKenna Hensley got into 10 colleges — each with its own distinctive financial aid offer. ""It was very confusing,"" she says. ""It makes a difference when you're paying yourself. You have to be extra careful."" Elissa Nadworny/NPR Elissa Nadworny/NPR McKenna Hensley got into 10 colleges — each with its own distinctive financial aid offer. ""It was very confusing,"" she says. ""It makes a difference when you're paying yourself. You have to be extra careful."" Elissa Nadworny/NPR
This time last year, McKenna Hensley had a big question on her mind: Where would she go to college? The answer — sort of — was somewhere in her pile of 10 financial aid offers. Each school she'd been admitted to had its own individualized letter, terms and calculations.
""It was very confusing,"" the now college freshman remembers.
One letter sticks out in her mind: The school had bolded about $76,000 in the upper-right corner of its offer. She remembers smiling really big and thinking, ""I got a lot of money!"" But when she looked a little closer, she saw that the big number included loans. Hensley was determined not to borrow. She took the letter and added up all the costs of attending, then subtracted the grants and scholarships and found she was still about $30,000 short.
Hensley looks through her college acceptance letters and financial aid offers. Elissa Nadworny/NPR Hensley looks through her college acceptance letters and financial aid offers. Elissa Nadworny/NPR
""I was like, 'Oh, you almost got me!' "" she says, laughing. "" 'This is a bad deal.' ""
Hensley ended up enrolling at Ohio State University, where scholarships and grants covered everything, but the roller coaster of emotions from her financial aid offers still feels very fresh.
""You'll feel like you have a whole bunch of money,"" she says, ""but you don't.""
Right now, students across the United States are in the process of choosing where to enroll. For many, that decision is closely tied to a college's financial aid offer. But with no current standardization of these offers, letters look vastly different from one school to the next. They're often filled with confusing terms, and the numbers are all over the map.
""I think anyone who's worked with students is just like, 'No, no, no, no, no. What a mess,' "" says Rachel Fishman, a researcher at the progressive think tank New America. She helped co-author a report with the nonprofit uAspire that analyzed more than 11,000 award letters from about 500 colleges, most of which were four-year institutions.
""It's really the Wild West when it comes to how these letters look,"" she says. How To Calculate The Cost Of College: A Guide To Financial Aid Terms
This story was produced with support from the Education Writers Association Reporting Fellowship program.
And that isn't just an inconvenience for students and parents — it has lasting consequences. ""This is a really critical moment. This is the moment you decide,"" says Laura Keane, uAspire's chief policy officer. ""Students rely on these financial aid offers to make their decisions.""
It's also when students first weigh their options with student loans, which can follow them well into adulthood.
3 big problems with financial aid award letters
Because financial aid offers are sent to individuals, researchers have found it difficult to study them en masse. But uAspire, an organization that works with students during the admissions process, has been collecting them for years. The uAspire-New America report yielded the following takeaways:
1. There is a lot of jargon and terminology. Take something like the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan, which often appears on award letters. To be eligible, students simply have to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. Researchers found that colleges referred to this loan 136 different ways in their financial aid letters. Some colleges didn't even use the word ""loan"" — they called it ""Fed Dir Unsub"" or just plain ""Unsubsidized."" Loading...
Don't see the graphic above? Click here.
Many of these weird names stem from the software that schools use to generate letters, Fishman explains. Still, she says, ""it's just such a damning example of even the smallest thing that should be really simple — there are so many institutions doing different things.""
2. More than a third of the schools didn't include how much it would cost to attend — only how much the student was awarded. ""The first thing you're trying to figure out is, 'What the heck is this gonna cost me?' "" Fishman says. ""You're looking around for this number, and there's nothing.""
3. Seventy percent of offers put all the aid together, so it feels like one big gift — like Hensley found in her letters. That aid included money from loans, even though students would have to pay that money back. Some schools lumped in things like work-study, which pays students as they work throughout the semester and doesn't help cover tuition when the bill is due at the beginning of the year.
Nonprofits, school districts and guidance counselors help students, especially low-income students, navigate their letters. Hensley worked with a virtual adviser from the nonprofit College Advising Corps. That adviser shared a Google spreadsheet with formulas to help her compare schools. Hensley just had to scan the letters for things like total scholarships, grants, tuition and living expenses, then plug those numbers into the document. The tool performed calculations so Hensley could easily see which schools she'd still need money for.

Many nonprofits offer similar calculators, and a handful of school districts have tools to help students sort through their numbers, like this one from District of Columbia Public Schools .
Policy is catching up
At the national level, there's legislation to solve this problem. In March, a group of bipartisan senators — including Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa — reintroduced a bill to standardize financial aid award letters."

Getting the horse racing industry — track managers, owners, trainers — to embrace the ideas of less racing and more rest for the horses is going to take a culture change, Arthur says. But he adds if that doesn't happen, and horses keep dying at higher rates, there's a unanimous belief in what will happen.
""If we don't make racing safer,"" he says, ""I don't think the public's going to allow us to continue the sport.""
Regulating medication
A more immediate, and perhaps easier fix to make racing safer is restricting use of medications for race horses. It's been a hugely controversial issue over the years and critics of over-medication point to what they call a more humane and effective use of drugs by the international racing industry.
Recent changes at Santa Anita put the track more in line with international standards. The California Horse Racing Board approved proposals by track owner, the Stronach Group, to ban medications given to horses on the day they race – medications that can mask symptoms and thereby put the horse in danger of injuring itself.

Mario Tama/Getty Images The 125-year-old Jockey Club, which registers all thoroughbreds in the U.S., supports the changes, and put out its own white paper in late March. The paper calls for comprehensive reform in the U.S. horse racing industry, and also focuses on medications and drug testing.
Jockey Club Executive Director Matt Iuliano says his organization published a document in 2011 calling for reform of racing medication rules. It was similar to the new white paper.
""We think the time is even more ripe now [for reform],"" says Iuliano. It's something we should all worry about and make us have a singular focus. How do we improve the health and safety of that [horse]?""
What's different now
The last fatality in the spate of Santa Anita horse deaths, was on March 31. The weather now is warm and Dr. Rick Arthur says the track is in great shape. Along with the new rules on medication, more veterinarians have been dispatched to watch horses during training sessions. Even the industry's harshest critic, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, praises the ownership group's action.
""As tragic as it sounds, it's a good thing [the spike of horse deaths] happened here,"" says PETA Senior Vice President Kathy Guillermo. ""Where the company that owns the track is trying to make something of a difference.""
Guillermo says her organization started working on the issue of horse racing deaths a decade ago, but now senses people outside the industry are more aware.
""What's different now,"" she says, ""is we have a public that's intolerant of abuse. So it's getting so much more attention. It's long overdue.""
With the Kentucky Derby less than a month away, Guillermo says PETA is shifting its focus to Churchill Downs. Late last month, the Louisville Courier Journal described that famed racetrack as one of the deadliest in the U.S.
Guillermo said in a statement this week, ""PETA is putting Kentucky on notice. No horses died during Santa Anita Derby weekend, which seems to show the track's new rules – while not as strong as PETA would have liked — are a lifesaving step. Churchill Downs has the second worst death rate for horses in the country. Change is overdue. It needs to come now.""
All those breathing a sigh of relief at Santa Anita know, however, it could be short lived. Until the next catastrophic horse injury.
On the way out of the track this weekend, a visitor wished a steward good luck for the rest of this season. A steward enforces the racing rules at Santa Anita.
""Thanks,"" she said. ""We need all the good thoughts we can get."""

Devan Schwartz for NPR Normally, a chief financial officer's job involves poring over balance sheets and bank statements. But in the pot business, the job still bears a lot of similarities to the illicit trade — transporting loads of cash under the watchful eye of big guys carrying lots of guns.
Just ask Tom DiGiovanni.
This chief financial officer and former Ernst & Young accountant leans into an unmarked armored van where there's a metal cage to protect the revenues for his company, Canndescent, from would-be thieves.
The Salt Haute Pot: How High-End California Chefs Are Cashing In On Marijuana ""Over the course of a month, we probably have $2 million in cash that's in some state of transit,"" he says. By the end of the year, that's expected to top $4 million, which will mean more armored vans and heavily armed guards.
""They have an ankle holster and another one in the small of their back and they're wearing tactical gear,"" DiGiovanni says. ""It's pretty crazy.""
DiGiovanni looks like he could be Ray Liotta's brother, with a nightclub bouncer's build. He says he likes living on the edge — at least businesswise. That's good, since aspects of his job feel more akin to gangster than pencil pusher.
Marijuana is legal medically or recreationally in 34 states, but it's still illegal under federal law. And though many businesses have entered that new gray market, the financial services industry has not. No major U.S. banks will open accounts for a company like Canndescent or its retail clients.

Devan Schwartz for NPR Last month, the House Financial Services Committee advanced legislation that would authorize banks to serve the cannabis industry .
Anti-cannabis groups oppose the bill, and legalization generally. They argue the legal trade is a threat to public health that outweighs the tax benefits.
The measure has 157 bipartisan co-sponsors so far. But until it passes the full House and Senate, every aspect of DiGiovanni's job will be fraught with added risk and costs — from getting insurance, to paying employees, to filing taxes.
The estimated 300 U.S. financial institutions that serve the pot industry are small, state-chartered banks or credit unions. They're audited frequently, and transactions are monitored closely for suspicious activity. A cannabis business pays thousands in monthly fees just to have an account.
Code Switch What John Boehner's Pivot On Cannabis Tells Us About The Legal Weed Boom After scouring the state looking for a credit union to work with, DiGiovanni found one willing to deposit his marijuana revenue. But about every week, he gets calls from retail clients looking for a way to bank, because their accounts were shut down.
Banks also won't lend to the industry because if the federal government were to seize a company's assets, the lender would have nothing to collect on the loan.
DiGiovanni says the risk of that is extremely low. Yet that fear makes everything harder to access. He's been turned down by payroll companies, human-resource software firms and insurance brokers.
And, because of the extra risk, everything costs more. Canndescent invested $200,000 in an automated weighing machine that makes packaging six times faster, for example. The interest rate was 18 percent, or nearly three times the normal rate.

toggle caption Devan Schwartz for NPR Canndescent grows and sells premium pot to retailers throughout California. Most of them pay for the goods in cash.
Devan Schwartz for NPR Two years ago, an infection destroyed Canndescent's hydroponic beds of seedlings. But crop insurance wasn't available for marijuana, so the company ate the $600,000 loss.
Most financing for cannabis businesses come from individual investors. Canndescent built its 27,000-square-foot grow house in Desert Hot Springs, Calif., largely with money from friends and family of the founder.
Meanwhile, sales keep growing, which means dealing with the headache of handling more cash — most of it in $20 bills. Counting all of that money is a pain, and it's heavy. DiGiovanni employs workers to do just that.
Business Cannabis Producer Gets $4 Billion Investment From Beer Company ""It's three or four hours a day that they're standing in front of that machine, feeding cash into it,"" he says. And it must be counted three times, at an undisclosed location, after every transfer — a process we're not allowed to see. ""It gets transported again on a random schedule to our processing facility, which is in a different city that I won't name,"" he says.
Safety is one primary argument in favor of legalizing banking for the industry, says Alyson Martin, co-founder of news site Cannabis Wire.
""Because these are essentially cash-only businesses, they become sitting ducks for robberies, thefts and those sorts of things,"" she says.
Business As More States Legalize Marijuana, Investors And Marketers Line Up Banking is the industry's biggest challenge, she says. ""I don't think I've talked to anybody who hasn't had banking headaches.""
DiGiovanni says he thinks the legislation will eventually pass and that will change things for the company. He says better access to banks would help him grow the business faster and hire more. And, in the long run, raise even more tax revenue for the government. But until then, he'll continue moving piles of cash about in bulletproof vans under a blanket of secrecy.

A 14-Year-Old Oil Spill In The Gulf That No One Can Stop,www.npr.org,"Jonathan Henderson, Vanishing Earth",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711085901/this-oil-spill-has-been-leaking-into-the-gulf-for-14-years?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement are using Ian MacDonald's data to estimate the amount of oil being spilled at the Taylor Energy site.

toggle caption Tegan Wendland/WWNO The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement are using Ian MacDonald's data to estimate the amount of oil being spilled at the Taylor Energy site.
Tegan Wendland/WWNO Ten miles out in the Gulf of Mexico, off the tip of Louisiana, the fumes become overwhelming. ""See how it's all rainbow sheen there? So that's oil,"" says Ian MacDonald, who's guiding us in a tiny fishing boat that's being tossed around by 6-foot waves.
MacDonald is a scientist at Florida State University where he studies oil spills. This one is not a black, sticky slick, but it stretches on for miles. And here, where the murky Mississippi River dumps into the Gulf, it's been leaking for more than 14 years.
The Coast Guard has just begun to intervene to try and clean up this spill. But it faces challenges. And MacDonald sees the spill as a warning for regulators, just as the Trump administration pushes to expand offshore oil drilling in the Atlantic.
A hurricane, an oil rig, an underwater mudslide
The spill began in 2004, when Hurricane Ivan toppled an oil rig into the Gulf. The rig was owned by Taylor Energy, a New Orleans-based company, which managed to plug some of the 25 broken pipes, but the leak continued.
Jonathan Henderson runs an environmental nonprofit called Vanishing Earth and worries about the impact on marine life. ""Everything that lives and breathes in the Gulf of Mexico travels back and forth through that zone,"" he says. ""Fish, seabirds, turtles, dolphins.""
Everything that lives and breathes in the Gulf of Mexico travels back and forth through that zone.
Jonathan Henderson, Vanishing Earth
The government is studying the impact on marine life, but even they can't figure out exactly how much oil is leaking. Neither can the company.
Henderson has been trying to monitor it himself by doing regular flyovers and reporting what he sees. He's frustrated at the government's response. ""If we can put a man on the moon, we can figure out how to, like, grab oil that's coming up from the seafloor and 400 feet of water,"" he says.
The Department of the Interior and the Coast Guard have been working with the company to try to stop the leak for years, but it poses a major engineering challenge. The wells were buried under hundreds of feet of mud in an underwater mudslide, which are common in the area, where the mouth of the Mississippi has built up hundreds of feet of silt on the bottom of the ocean floor.
""This is a well-known, high-risk area,"" says Ed Richards, a law professor at Louisiana State University. He says it raises questions about offshore development. ""Should they have built the rig the way they built it? Should it have been permitted that way?""
Taylor Energy has spent about $500 million to try to stop the spill, and it's paying for pilots to fly over and monitor it. The company has reported less than a barrel of oil a day on the surface, but estimates vary widely.

Courtesy of Jonathan Henderson/Vanishing Earth Hundreds of barrels each day
Ian MacDonald visits the site of the Taylor Energy oil spill regularly. He's helping measure the size of the spill for the government. He estimates that about 100 barrels of oil are spilling into the Gulf each day, what he calls a sobering finding, ""and neither the government nor the responsible parties have been able to stop it, or even acknowledge that it really existed until now.""
MacDonald says the situation should serve as a warning to regulators as they attempt to expand oil and gas drilling in the Atlantic, where underwater canyons pose a threat to underwater infrastructure.
""The idea that we would be building in deep water, and making pipelines going back to land in an area that's susceptible to those kinds of accidents,"" he says, ""is something that we should take into account as we do our planning.""
But he worries that's not happening. The Trump administration has rolled back offshore safety rules, even as it works to open up more areas to drilling.
A giant containment dome
Earlier this year, the Coast Guard began hiring contractors to try to stop the spill by dropping a giant metal containment dome over the wells in order to collect the leaking oil. Taylor Energy says this could make the leak worse, so it has sued the Coast Guard.
Neither the government nor the company agreed to go on record, saying litigation is ongoing.
Back on the boat in the Gulf, MacDonald remains hopeful.
""I'm really glad to be out here and to see this operation,"" he says, "" because it's been a long time coming, and there's a lot riding on it.""
But he says it might be that no one is able to stop the oil from bubbling up into the Gulf. If that's the case, according to government estimates , the leak could go on for 100 more years."

The heads of some of the nation's biggest banks faced tough questions from Democrats on Wednesday about overdraft fees, the stability of the banking system and their own multimillion-dollar compensation.
The House Financial Services Committee hearing was titled, ""Holding Megabanks Accountable: A Review of Global Systemically Important Banks 10 years after the Financial Crisis.""
""Ten years ago, the CEOs appeared before this very committee to discuss the financial crisis and the massive bailout taxpayers provided,"" said committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif. ""A decade later, what have they learned? Are they helping their customers and working to benefit the communities they serve? Or are the practices of these banks still causing harm?""
Politics 'Auntie Maxine' Waters Gets Ready To Take On The Banks As House Panel Chair But much of the questioning veered into executive pay and consumer issues.
Democrat Nydia Velazquez of New York noted that Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat received $24 million in compensation last year, while the median bank salary is less than $50,000.
""Does this ratio seem fair to you?"" she asked Corbat.
""My compensation is decided by our board and voted on by our shareholders,"" he replied.
""If you were an employee, and you saw your boss making $486 for every dollar you make, how would you feel about that situation?"" Velazquez asked.
""I would be hopeful there's opportunity to continue to advance within the firm,"" he said.
""Unbelievable,"" Velazquez said. ""And this is why people that live in a bubble or ivory towers cannot understand why there's so much anger out there.""
Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., told JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon his bank has been the subject of numerous complaints about overdraft fees, citing data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Business Wells Fargo CEO Quits In Wake Of Consumer Financial Scandals ""You're essentially gouging your most vulnerable clients, the ones that are living paycheck to paycheck,"" she said.
Dimon replied that bank customers can choose accounts that have different overdraft fee structures.
""The overdraft policy as it stands today, which was changed, by the way, in 2009, is that the client has to opt in,"" he said. ""They are given a choice on opening the account on whether they want to have overdraft features or not.""
Also testifying at the hearing were Bank of America's Brian Moynihan, David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley's James Gorman, State Street's Ronald O'Hanley and Charles Scharf of Bank of New York Mellon.
It's the first time bank CEOs have appeared before the committee since the Democratic takeover of Congress and the first joint appearance by the heads of all seven banks on Capitol Hill since the financial crash.
Business Bank Of America Raising Its Minimum Wage To $20 An Hour Perhaps in anticipation of Wednesday's hearing, Bank of America announced it would raise its minimum wage to $20 an hour by 2021.
Ranking member Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., accused Democrats of staging a political stunt and said the committee would be better focused on relevant issues like the impact of Brexit on the U.S. financial system.
""Why are we here?"" he asked. ""I fear our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are here to attack our economic system, attack the nature of our market. I fear my friends want to dictate social and environmental policy through government mandates on banks. That's not the right approach.""
McHenry questioned the CEOs about whether Britain's departure from the European Union without a firm plan in place would destabilize the global financial system.
Most said it would be a challenge but not a systemic risk. The heads of Citigroup and Bank of New York Mellon said they have already taken steps to relocate their British operations to other European countries in anticipation of a hard Brexit."

Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images Federal prosecutors on Tuesday said they dismantled one of the largest health care fraud schemes ever investigated by the FBI, charging 24 people in a $1.2 billion alleged scam involving telemedicine and durable medical equipment companies.
As part of the complex operation, doctors got kickbacks for prescribing unneeded back, shoulder, wrist and knee braces to elderly and disabled patients and charging the government's Medicare program, the Department of Justice said.
The accused ""concocted an elaborate scheme to exploit the U.S. health care system by targeting Medicare beneficiaries, paying doctors for prescriptions, paying kickbacks and bribes, and in turn selling these prescriptions to DME companies to ensure that they could line their pockets,"" IRS special agent Matthew Line said, according to Tut Underwood of South Carolina Public Radio.
Prosecutors allege a multilayered scheme to defraud Medicare. Call centers in the Philippines and Latin America advertised to Medicare beneficiaries and ""up-sold"" them on unnecessary medical braces, they say.
The call centers then paid bribes to telemedicine companies, who in turn paid doctors to write orders for the equipment. Then the call centers sold the orders to the durable medical equipment companies and billed Medicare.
Shots - Health News HHS Inspector General's Report Finds Flaws And Fraud In U.S. Hospice Care Equipment companies would ship the braces to beneficiaries. They would receive about $500 to $900 per brace from Medicare and paid kickbacks of almost $300 per brace, according to the Associated Press.
Doctors wrote prescriptions for medical equipment without any interaction with patients or after only a brief phone conversation, the DOJ said.
People participating in the alleged scheme laundered money through shell companies and used proceeds to buy ""exotic automobiles, yachts and luxury real estate in the United States and abroad.""
CEOs, COOs and associates with five telemedicine companies; owners of durable medical equipment companies; and three licensed medical professionals were among the 24 people charged.

The government Center for Medicare Services' anti-fraud branch said it took ""adverse administrative action"" against 130 medical equipment companies that had billed Medicare more than $1.7 billion in claims and were paid more than $900 million.
The IRS chief of criminal investigation, Don Fort, said in a statement that the organized scheme ""details broad corruption, massive amounts of greed, and systemic flaws in our healthcare system that were exploited by the defendants.""
The FBI, IRS and 17 U.S. attorneys' offices took part in the operation, according to AP."
Contract Cheating: Colleges Crack Down On Ghostwritten Essays,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/710985799/contract-cheating-colleges-crack-down-on-ghostwritten-essays?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Concern is growing about a burgeoning online market for ghostwritten essays that students can turn in as their own work.

Angela Hsieh/NPR As the recent college admissions scandal is shedding light on how parents are cheating and bribing their children's way into college, schools are also focusing on how some students may be cheating their way through college. Concern is growing about a burgeoning online market for ghostwritten essays that students can turn in as their own work. And schools are trying new tools to catch it.
It's not hard to understand the temptation for students. The pressure is enormous, the stakes are high and, for some, writing at a college level is a huge leap.
""We didn't really have a format to follow, so I was kind of lost on what to do,"" says one college freshman, who struggled recently with an English assignment. One night, when she was feeling particularly overwhelmed, she tweeted her frustration.
""It was like, 'Someone, please help me write my essay!' "" she recalls. She ended her tweet with a crying emoji. Within a few minutes, she had a half-dozen offers of help.
""I can write it for you,"" they tweeted back. ""Send us the prompt!""
The student, who asked that her name not be used for fear of repercussions at school, chose one that asked for $10 per page, and she breathed a sigh of relief.
""For me, it was just that the work was piling up,"" she explains. ""As soon as I finish some big assignment, I get assigned more things, more homework for math, more homework for English. Some papers have to be six or 10 pages long. ... And even though I do my best to manage, the deadlines come closer and closer, and it's just ... the pressure.""
In the cat-and-mouse game of academic cheating, students these days know that if they plagiarize, they're likely to get caught by computer programs that automatically compare essays against a massive database of other writings. So now, buying an original essay can seem like a good workaround.
""Technically, I don't think it's cheating,"" the student says. ""Because you're paying someone to write an essay, which they don't plagiarize, and they write everything on their own.""
Her logic, of course, ignores the question of whether she's plagiarizing. When pressed, she begins to stammer.
""That's just a difficult question to answer,"" she says. ""I don't know how to feel about that. It's kind of like a gray area. It's maybe on the edge, kind of?""
Besides she adds, she probably won't use all of it.
Other students justify essay buying as the only way to keep up. They figure that everyone is doing it one way or another — whether they're purchasing help online or getting it from family or friends.
""Oh yeah, collaboration at its finest,"" cracks Boston University freshman Grace Saathoff. While she says she would never do it herself, she's not really fazed by others doing it. She agrees with her friends that it has pretty much become socially acceptable.
""I have a friend who writes essays and sells them,"" says Danielle Delafuente, another Boston University freshman. ""And my other friend buys them. He's just like, 'I can't handle it. I have five papers at once. I need her to do two of them, and I'll do the other three.' It's a time management thing.""
The war on contract cheating
""It breaks my heart that this is where we're at,"" sighs Ashley Finley, senior adviser to the president for the Association of American Colleges and Universities. She says campuses are abuzz about how to curb the rise in what they call contract cheating. Obviously, students buying essays is not new, but Finley says that what used to be mostly limited to small-scale side hustles has mushroomed on the internet to become a global industry of so-called essay mills. Hard numbers are difficult to come by, but research suggests that up to 16 percent of students have paid someone to do their work and that the number is rising.
""Definitely, this is really getting more and more serious,"" Finley says. ""It's part of the brave new world for sure.""
The essay mills market aggressively online, with slickly produced videos inviting students to ""Get instant help with your assignment"" and imploring them: ""Don't lag behind,"" ""Join the majority"" and ""Don't worry, be happy.""
""They're very crafty,"" says Tricia Bertram Gallant, director of the Academic Integrity Office at the University of California in San Diego and a board member of the International Center for Academic Integrity.
The companies are equally brazen offline — leafleting on campuses, posting flyers in toilet stalls and flying banners over Florida beaches during spring break. Companies have also been known to bait students with emails that look like they're from official college help centers. And they pay social media influencers to sing the praises of their services, and they post testimonials from people they say are happy customers.
""I hired a service to write my paper and I got a 90 on it!"" gloats one. ""Save your time, and have extra time to party!"" advises another.
""It's very much a seduction,"" says Bertram Gallant. ""So you can maybe see why students could get drawn into the contract cheating world.""
YouTube has been cracking down on essay mills; it says it has pulled thousands of videos that violate its policies against promoting dishonest behavior.
But new videos constantly pop up, and their hard sell flies in the face of their small-print warnings that their essays should be used only as a guide, not a final product.
Several essay mills declined or didn't respond to requests to be interviewed by NPR. But one answered questions by email and offered up one of its writers to explain her role in the company, called EduBirdie.
""Yes, just like the little birdie that's there to help you in your education,"" explains April Short, a former grade school teacher from Australia who's now based in Philadelphia. She has been writing for a year and a half for the company, which bills itself as a ""professional essay writing service for students who can't even.""
Some students just want some ""foundational research"" to get started or a little ""polish"" to finish up, Short says. But the idea that many others may be taking a paper written completely by her and turning it in as their own doesn't keep her up at night.
""These kids are so time poor,"" she says, and they're ""missing out on opportunities of travel and internships because they're studying and writing papers."" Relieving students of some of that burden, she figures, allows them to become more ""well-rounded.""
""I don't necessarily think that being able to create an essay is going to be a defining factor in a very long career, so it's not something that bothers me,"" says Short. Indeed, she thinks students who hire writers are demonstrating resourcefulness and creativity. ""I actually applaud students that look for options to get the job done and get it done well,"" she says.
""This just shows you the extent of our ability to rationalize all kinds of bad things we do,"" sighs Dan Ariely, professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University. The rise in contract cheating is especially worrisome, he says, because when it comes to dishonest behavior, more begets more. As he puts it, it's not just about ""a few bad apples.""
Law Felicity Huffman And 12 Other Parents To Plead Guilty In College Cheating Scandal ""Instead, what we have is a lot ... of blemished apples, and we take our cues for our behavior from the social world around us,"" he says. ""We know officially what is right and what's wrong. But really what's driving our behavior is what we see others around us doing"" or, Ariely adds, what we perceive them to be doing. So even the proliferation of advertising for essays mills can have a pernicious effect, he says, by fueling the perception that ""everyone's doing it.""
A few nations have recently proposed or passed laws outlawing essay mills, and more than a dozen U.S. states have laws on the books against them. But prosecuting essay mills, which are often based overseas in Pakistan, Kenya and Ukraine, for example, is complicated. And most educators are loath to criminalize students' behavior.
""Yes, they're serious mistakes. They're egregious mistakes,"" says Cath Ellis, an associate dean and integrity officer at the University of New South Wales, where students were among the hundreds alleged to have bought essays in a massive scandal in Australia in 2014.
""But we're educational institutions,"" she adds. ""We've got to give students the opportunity to learn from these mistakes. That's our responsibility. And that's better in our hands than in the hands of the police and the courts.""
Staying one step ahead
In the war on contract cheating, some schools see new technology as their best weapon and their best shot to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous students. The company that makes the Turnitin plagiarism detection software has just upped its game with a new program called Authorship Investigate.
The software first inspects a document's metadata, like when it was created, by whom it was created and how many times it was reopened and re-edited. Turnitin's vice president for product management, Bill Loller, says sometimes it's as simple as looking at the document's name. Essay mills typically name their documents something like ""Order Number 123,"" and students have been known to actually submit it that way. ""You would be amazed at how frequently that happens,"" says Loller.
Using cutting-edge linguistic forensics, the software also evaluates the level of writing and its style.
""Think of it as a writing fingerprint,"" Loller says. The software looks at hundreds of telltale characteristics of an essay, like whether the author double spaces after a period or writes with Oxford commas or semicolons. It all gets instantly compared against a student's other work, and, Loller says, suspicions can be confirmed — or alleviated — in minutes.
""At the end of the day, you get to a really good determination on whether the student wrote what they submitted or not,"" he says, ""and you get it really quickly.""
Coventry University in the U.K. has been testing out a beta version of the software, and Irene Glendinning, the school's academic manager for student experience, agrees that the software has the potential to give schools a leg up on cheating students. After the software is officially adopted, ""we'll see a spike in the number of cases we find, and we'll have a very hard few years,"" she says. ""But then the message will get through to students that we've got the tools now to find these things out."" Then, Glendinning hopes, students might consider contract cheating to be as risky as plagiarizing.
In the meantime, schools are trying to spread the word that buying essays is risky in other ways as well.
Professor Ariely says that when he posed as a student and ordered papers from several companies, much of it was ""gibberish"" and about a third of it was actually plagiarized.
Even worse, when he complained to the company and demanded his money back, they resorted to blackmail. Still believing him to be a student, the company threatened to tell his school he was cheating. Others say companies have also attempted to shake down students for more money, threatening to rat them out if they didn't pay up.
The lesson, Ariely says, is ""buyer beware.""
But ultimately, experts say, many desperate students may not be deterred by the risks — whether from shady businesses or from new technology.
Bertram Gallant, of UC San Diego, says the right way to dissuade students from buying essays is to remind them why it's wrong.
""If we engage in a technological arms race with the students, we won't win,"" she says. ""What are we going to do when Google glasses start to look like regular glasses and a student wears them into an exam? Are we going to tell them they can't wear their glasses because we're afraid they might be sending the exam out to someone else who is sending them back the answers?""
The solution, Bertram Gallant says, has to be about ""creating a culture where integrity and ethics matter"" and where education is valued more than grades. Only then will students believe that cheating on essays is only cheating themselves."
"Indivior, Maker of Suboxone, Accused Of Fraud In Drug Marketing",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711669778/opioid-maker-charged-with-fraud-in-marketing-drug-as-less-prone-to-abuse?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Eamon Queeney/The Washington Post/Getty Images Eamon Queeney/The Washington Post/Getty Images Federal prosecutors late Tuesday charged British drug maker Indivior with felony fraud and conspiracy for its marketing of opioid products including Suboxone. The company allegedly created a ""nationwide scheme"" in the U.S. designed to convince doctors and government insurance providers that Indivior's patented opioid medications are safer and less prone to abuse than cheaper generic alternatives.
""The indictment alleges that, rather than marketing its opioid-addiction drug responsibly, Indivior promoted it with a disregard for the truth about its safety and despite known risks of diversion and abuse,"" said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt in a statement.
Federal prosecutors claim Indivior bilked Medicare, Medicaid and other health care providers out of billions of dollars as they paid for a more expensive version of the drug, believing it to be safer. The criminal charges, filed in the western district of Virginia, stem from a joint investigation that included the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Virginia's state attorney general office, and other agencies.
The company issued a statement denying any wrongdoing. ""Key allegations made by the Justice Department are contradicted by the government's own scientific agencies,"" Indivior said on Tuesday, adding that the firm ""will contest this case vigorously and we look forward to the full facts coming out in court.""
At the heart of the 28-count indictment is Indivior's effort, beginning in 2007, to popularize a new method of delivering its Suboxone medication, which is used to treat patients suffering from opioid dependency. With a cheaper generic tablet form of the drug expected to go on sale, the company developed a dissolvable film that could be placed under the tongue, describing the new delivery system as ""less abusable"" with a ""lower risk.""
Prosecutors now say the company knew the dissolvable film version of Suboxone was potentially more dangerous, more susceptible to abuse, and included a higher risk that children might be exposed to the drug. The firm also developed a program that allegedly connected opioid-dependent patients with doctors who prescribed Suboxone ""in high doses and in suspect circumstances.""
Federal prosecutors say if Indivior is found guilty, the company should forfeit at least $3 billion in penalties. In its response, Indivior said the company acted responsibly and has played a crucial role responding to the deadly opioid epidemic. The firm also says it tried to negotiate a settlement before the charges were filed.
""We are extremely disappointed in this action by the Justice Department, which is wholly unsupported by either the facts or the law,"" Indivior's statement said.
National Oklahoma Drops Some Claims To 'Refocus' Lawsuit Against Opioid-Makers Asia China To Close Loophole On Fentanyl After U.S. Calls For Opioid Action This indictment marks an escalation in what has already emerged as a dangerous year for major drugmakers and distributors entangled in the opioid crisis. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prescription opioid overdoses have killed more than 200,000 Americans over the last 20 years.
Companies including Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson and CVS face a wave of civil lawsuits in state courts around the country. They stem from claims that Big Pharma accelerated the opioid crisis by aggressively marketing prescription painkillers and other opioid medications. The next major trial is set to begin next month in Oklahoma.
Federal prosecutors have successfully pursued criminal charges against opioid manufacturers in the past. In 2007 , Purdue Pharma and three of its executives pleaded guilty and paid more than $600 million in fines and other charges after the company falsely claimed its Oxycontin medication was less addictive than other opioid painkillers."

Callao Cave Archaeology Project An unusual species of human apparently lived on the island of Luzon in the Philippines as recently as 50,000 years ago. Based on teeth and bones found there, scientists suspect that these early humans probably stood less than 4 feet tall and had several apelike features. Yet, the researchers say, the bones are distinctly human — from a previously undiscovered species.
The first clue was a bone that surfaced in 2007. Archaeologist Armand Salvador Mijares was digging in a cave on the island of Luzon and found a toe bone. He says it didn't look like a modern human bone. ""There's something peculiar with this bone,"" he recalls thinking. But one bone wasn't enough to say for sure who or what it belonged to.

Callao Cave Archaeology Project Mijares, who's with the University of the Philippines, was part of a team looking for bones of early humans. They kept digging for four more years. In 2011, they hit pay dirt — more toe bones, as well as finger bones, part of a thigh bone and seven teeth. And none looked like it belonged to modern humans. ""We agreed that this could probably be a new species,"" Mijares says.
Discovering a new species of ancient human is a career-maker in anthropology — or career-breaker, if you're wrong. So the team spent another eight years studying the bones and teeth. They now conclude that the skeletal fragments are from three individuals who lived sometime between 50,000 and 67,000 years ago. Writing this week in the journal Nature, the scientists call them Homo luzonensis, after the island.

Emily Bazelon's 'Charged' Reveals How Prosecutors And Plea Bargains Drive Mass Incarceration,www.npr.org,Emily Bazelon,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711654831/charged-explains-how-prosecutors-and-plea-bargains-drive-mass-incarceration,"Independent Booksellers
On why so many cases end in plea bargains
Plea bargains keep the system moving much more quickly. They are far less time-consuming in terms of hours in court than a trial. And so you've really seen them take over the system. Justice Anthony Kennedy several years ago said for the Supreme Court that plea bargains were not an adjunct to the system, they really had become the entire system. When you think about the criminal justice system the founders of our country designed, that's just a sea change. Trial by jury — it's in the Constitution, written into the Sixth Amendment, [but there's] nothing about plea bargains.
On how prosecutors' focus on winning convictions is linked to mass incarceration
We put prosecutors in this arguably difficult position. We tell them that it's their job to win convictions. We also tell them that they are obligated to be ministers of justice. Good prosecutors know how to balance those ethical responsibilities, but it's not always easy to curb your instinct to win. And so I think when prosecutors abuse their power, what we're seeing is a real tension in this dual nature of their role.
On the ways the criminal justice system unfairly targets poor people
We have so many people who've gotten tangled up in the criminal justice system. And for misdemeanor offenses, often we're not talking about jail or prison sentences, but we are talking about other consequences where you have this notation on your record that can really affect the opportunities that you have going out from there. Former Physician At Rikers Island Exposes Health Risks Of Incarceration
So I think those costs are leading people in the reform movement to really question why we criminalize certain behavior and not others. So for example, fare beating, turnstile jumping: Those are things people get arrested for. Well, if you're a driver of a car, a more middle-class person, [and] you blow through an E-Z Pass on the highway, you're not going to get arrested. You're going to get a fine. So we have different ways of punishing different classes of people for minor kinds of wrongdoing that have a tremendous impact on people's lives.
On how bail works
Here's how for-profit cash bail works in New York: You go in front of a judge; say he sets bail at $15,000. That's standard for a gun offense. You then can pay it at that moment if you have the cash, but of course most people don't have that amount of cash sitting around. And so then they have to go to a bail bondsman. Is America Engaged In A 'Vicious Circle' Of Jailing The Poor?
Usually, you work out a deal where you pay the bondsman 10 percent. Then the bondsman doesn't actually pay the court anything. They just go to the court and say we'll guarantee that if this person flees we will pay that amount. At the end of the case, if you have come to all your court appearances as almost everyone does, you're supposed to get your money back at the end. But I did not see people getting any more than, like, $60, $50 back when they completed this process. ...
But, in fact, we know from Washington, D.C., which has been doing it differently for years; from the state of Kentucky, which has a different system, that cash bail is not necessary to bring most people back to court. Most people, you just ask them politely to come back to court. You send them reminders, you connect them with support services if necessary and they'll come back, because they know it's going to be bad for them to have a warrant out there for their arrest.
On what happens to defendants who cannot afford bail
If you can't make bail, you go to jail. And we have probably about 6 million people every year in America who are sitting in jail because they can't afford to post bail and get out, sometimes for very minor offenses.
This is just a hidden cost of our system that we've tolerated for a long time. The question I would ask about it is why people are sitting in jail if they don't pose a threat to safety? ... I mean, if you are accused of marijuana possession, for example, and the judge asked you to post bail and you're poor and you can't post it, well you're going to jail where someone who was better off would not go to jail, and that has nothing to do with public safety. ...
We really have a system that treats people differently based on the amount of money they have — and that seems fundamentally wrong, and yet it drives our whole pretrial system. Emily Bazelon
We really have a system that treats people differently based on the amount of money they have — and that seems fundamentally wrong, and yet it drives our whole pretrial system.
On the new reform movement to curtail mass incarceration
This is a new movement that has really bubbled up in a bunch of cities since 2016. What you see here are people who want to reduce and end mass incarceration, realizing that they have the power to elect a new kind of prosecutor. These are local elections; voters decide [who the district attorney is], and if you're organized, you can have a big impact on these races.
So then these new DAs have come into office and they answer to a different constituency. It's not the old, you know, drum beating of law and order. The people who voted for them are saying, ""We want the system to be more fair, to treat victims and defendants better. We want prison and jail to be a last resort rather than the default all the time.""
And so these prosecutors are using their discretion in a different way to try to change the system. They can change the way they charge people. They can stop asking for bail in a lot of circumstances or all circumstances. They can decriminalize certain offenses, like jumping a turnstile or possessing marijuana. So you're seeing the great power that prosecutors have harnessed in a new and different way.

Immigration agents say they have identified more than 3,100 migrants over the past year making fraudulent claims about their age or family relationships after crossing the southern border.
This includes migrants who claim to be children, but who are actually 18 or older, as well as adults who falsely claim to be parents of minors they're traveling with, according to Brian Hastings, chief of law enforcement operations for Customs and Border Protection.
Officials highlighted the number during a conference call on Tuesday to announce the latest data on unauthorized migrants crossing the southern border.
More than 103,000 migrants were taken into custody in March — the biggest monthly total in more than a decade and a 35 percent jump over February. Nearly 6 out of 10 were family members.
The Trump administration says migrants are gaming the asylum system to gain entry into the United States. And border agents say they're encountering more ""fake families"" among the growing number of Central American migrants crossing the border.
But immigration advocates say most of the migrants are fleeing violence and poverty in Central America, and seeking a better life in the United States. The advocates say the Trump administration is exaggerating the threat to children.
In many cases, they say the parents already live in the U.S. and asked a relative or family friend to bring their children north, and to use fake documents to ensure they would be allowed into the country together.
Customs and Border Protection did not say how many fraudulent claims were made in years past for comparison. And this year's number is still a small fraction of apprehensions — 3,100 cases represents less than 0.5 percent of the total.
President Trump has said the recent surge is overwhelming the nation's immigration system. ""We can't take you anymore,"" he said last week to asylum seekers. ""Our country is full."""

Greg Epperson Greg Epperson This 1991 photo became famous in the climbing community after appearing in a 1995 Patagonia catalog. Almost three decades after the photo was taken, Jordan Leads, the baby pictured, is grown up and tells NPR about her perspective on the photo.
Greg Epperson Almost three decades ago, photographer Greg Epperson created an image that would become iconic to some in the climbing community: a 6-month-old baby in a purple jumpsuit in midair.
The picture records a moment while the infant is traveling across a vast gap between two giant boulders. Her precariously perched mother has thrown her toward the waiting arms of her father.
That baby is now 27 years old.
Jordan Leads landed safely in the arms of her father that day in 1991 after Epperson, a rock climbing photographer, asked her parents, Jeff and Sherry, if he could take a daring photo of them while at Joshua Tree National Park.
The photo first appeared publicly four years later in a Patagonia catalog. And now, it has been given a new life in the current catalog , along with an update about Jordan Leads, the star of the photo.
Leads lives in Las Vegas and is studying to become a court reporter. She says the photo of her flying over a gap in the boulders was just one of many outdoorsy shots that hung on the walls of her parents' house, which also had a climbing gym that her dad built in the garage.
A few years back, the photo resurfaced as a meme , and examples include her infant self leaping with a pod of dolphins, being hurled out of a cannon or punted by a kicker on a football field. Leads finds all of them entertaining.

But her favorite edited photo is the one ""where my parents are feeding me to a Jurassic Park dinosaur. I think that's the best.""
Leads says her parents surprisingly didn't get a lot of public scolding for flinging their baby over the rocks. That early moment of flight, along with her upbringing, seems to have stuck with her. She's now a rock climber and occasionally climbs with her father.
Hidden Brain Our Better Nature: How The Great Outdoors Can Improve Your Life Leads hopes to continue her family's value of the outdoors — and possibly re-create the photo.
""I can't wait to show it to my kids one day and to show them how I was growing up, how my parents raised me and to really just bring that whole family value of going outside back to them,"" Leads says. ""I would put [my photo] up on the wall, and then I could put my child's right next to it in our hallway ... I think that would be really cool.""

'Her Smell' Is A Brilliant And Blistering Portrait Of A Musician Falling Apart,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711832339/her-smell-is-a-brilliant-and-blistering-portrait-of-a-musician-falling-apart,"Critic Justin Chang says he couldn't tear his eyes away from Elisabeth Moss, who gives a spectacular performance as an out-of-control punk musician struggling with substance abuse.
TERRY GROSS, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. The actress Elisabeth Moss and the writer-director Alex Ross Perry previously collaborated on the independent dramas ""Listen Up Philip"" and ""Queen Of Earth."" Their new movie, ""Her Smell,"" stars Moss as an out-of-control punk rock musician. Dan Stevens, Virginia Madsen and Cara Delevingne play characters who bear witness to her self-destructive behavior. Film critic Justin Chang has this review.
JUSTIN CHANG, BYLINE: Between her superb performances on ""Mad Men,"" ""Top Of The Lake"" and ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" Elisabeth Moss has been one of the best actors working in television for quite some time. Her excellent film work hasn't garnered as much attention, though, hopefully, that's about to change. She did steal a few scenes recently in Jordan Peele's hit horror picture, ""Us,"" and she gives her most arresting performance yet in her new movie, ""Her Smell,"" written and directed by her regular collaborator, Alex Ross Perry.
This is a brilliant but blistering film, and it might be too emotionally draining an experience to draw the audience it deserves. The nose-wrinkling title may not help, either. But you should see it for Moss' spectacular psychological meltdown of a performance as Becky Something, the lead singer and guitarist of an all-female punk rock band called Something She. Early on, we see a flashback to the group's '90s heyday, when Becky and her bandmates - well played by Agyness Deyn and Gayle Rankin - first landed on the cover of Spin magazine. But most of the movie unfolds much later, after fame, wealth and substance abuse have taken their toll, and Something She is now playing in smaller clubs rather than sold-out arenas. The story is divided into five acts, and while some of them are set months or even years apart, each one plays out unflinchingly in real time.
The first three acts are like the proverbial slow-motion train wreck, as Becky flails around backstage at grungy concert venues or in a recording studio verbally incinerating everyone in her midst. She lashes out at her bandmates, her manager and even her mother, who seems to be forever apologizing for having brought this monster into the world. She rips into her ex-boyfriend, played by Dan Stevens, with whom she has a daughter, and you can't help but fear for the poor child's safety whenever her mom picks her up and gives her a maniacal squeeze.
Everyone takes Becky's abuse with varying degrees of tolerance, exasperation and justified anger. About halfway through the movie, her bandmates have had enough and walk out of the studio where they've been struggling to record a new album. Three up-and-coming rockers arrive to record in the same studio. And Becky, always ready to turn her defeat into victory, draws these star-struck young women into her orbit.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""HER SMELL"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) We don't need to be here. I know we can give you your space. Like, this must not be super easy.
ELISABETH MOSS: (As Becky Something) Wrong. I am the heart and soul of this band. Well, hello, I named it after myself. I found those girlies, and they were not the first and they will not be the last. I put Something She together from the ashes of failed junk bands wanting to have something in my own name like God spewing mankind. That's ancient history and so are those ungrateful wenches who suckled at the teat of success that I placed upon their mouth. But before we embark on this journey, promise me one thing. Show me honesty, and I will do the same because that is the pillar of my music. So enough with this jibber-jabber, and let's rock. (Singing) And that sums it up in one big lump.
CHANG: ""Her Smell"" sounds like an endurance test but as raw and abrasive as Perry's warts-and-all filmmaking can be, I found it utterly mesmerizing in its sound and fury. And I couldn't tear my eyes away from Moss, who gives us an astonishing portrait of celebrity gone ferociously to seed. Her hair has been dyed peroxide blonde as if to evoke Courtney Love, and her tongue often darts in and out of her mouth when she talks, suggesting a snake addressing its prey. Moss makes Lady Gaga in ""A Star Is Born"" look like even more of a Cinderella saint among pop divas. And she eclipses Natalie Portman in ""Vox Lux"" for sheer backstage histrionics. Unlike ""Vox Lux,"" ""Her Smell"" doesn't present a lofty thesis about the dark roots of celebrity flameout. Becky is too thorny and complicated to be reduced to a symbol or a symptom of some deeper social malaise.
What's remarkable about Moss' performance, apart from her convincing display of Becky's musical talent, is that it's beautifully modulated, even at its most extreme. Becky grins and cackles like a demon one minute, then drops scarily silent the next. Even at her most unhinged, she's startlingly lucid and hyper eloquent. That might be the product of Perry's show-offy (ph) impulses as a writer, but Moss is so good, she sells them as the character's own.
In its final two acts, ""Her Smell"" leaps ahead to find Becky hushed and humbled at last after a few years of rehab, signaling the arrival of a significant transformation. The harshness and dissonance of Perry's filmmaking clears away, and the movie strikes a clean, beautiful chord, a moment of reckoning that feels honest, heartbreaking and completely earned. We see Becky Something with sudden clarity for the good friend she once was, the loving mother she might have been and the gifted musician she still is. ""Her Smell"" might not have a great title, but it gives redemption movies a good name.
GROSS: Justin Chang is a film critic for the LA Times. He reviewed ""Her Smell,"" starring Elisabeth Moss. Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, my guest will be Henry Winkler. He won an Emmy for his portrayal of a self-important acting teacher in the HBO dark comedy series ""Barry,"" which is now in its second season. Winkler is known around the world for his role as the Fonz in the series ""Happy Days."" I hope you'll join us.

On Tuesday, President Trump tweeted out a video. He gave no explanation of what it was or where it came from — just an exhortation to ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""
The video was odd — it opened with footage of various Washington landmarks interspersed with clips of Barack Obama and Hillary and Bill Clinton. Then came clips of Trump visiting a factory, Trump meeting with Kim Jong Un, the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing, and clips of actors Rosie O'Donnell, Bryan Cranston and Amy Schumer, mixed in with shots of Trump at campaign rallies.
As a dramatic score played, words appeared on the screen: ""First they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they call you racist. Donald J. Trump. Your vote. Proved them all wrong. Trump: The Great Victory 2020.""
Just a few hours later, the video was taken down from YouTube.
The video was removed from YouTube after Warner Bros. complained that the use of music from The Dark Knight Rises was a violation of its copyright. Screenshot by NPR hide caption toggle caption Screenshot by NPR The video was removed from YouTube after Warner Bros. complained that the use of music from The Dark Knight Rises was a violation of its copyright. Screenshot by NPR
At issue was that dramatic score: It is music composed by Hans Zimmer for the soundtrack to the Warner Bros. 2012 Batman film The Dark Knight Rises .
In a statement, Warner Bros. said that the video's use of its music was unauthorized: ""We are working through the appropriate legal channels to have it removed.""
Trump later deleted the tweet. As of Wednesday afternoon, near-copies of the video were still on YouTube.
The video was apparently not created by the Trump campaign but rather by a fan. ""The video was made by a supporter,"" a campaign aide told CNN . ""We like to share content from diehard supporters, and this is just another example of how hard Trump supporters fight for the President."" Neil Young Is Displeased That Donald Trump Was 'Rockin' In The Free World'
The video was posted to a pro-Trump Reddit channel last week. The account that posted the video to the r/The_Donald subreddit wrote Tuesday that the video was made a couple of weeks ago, and its creator was shocked and delighted when Trump shared it.
""I'm honored,"" the person wrote. ""My dad has [Trump's] tweet printed so I can frame it.""
Artists including Neil Young , Pharrell Williams and the estate of Prince have all previously demanded that the Trump campaign stop playing their music, complaining that their songs had been used without permission.

Attorney General William Barr has launched his own informal inquiry about the origins of the Russia investigation, he confirmed to senators on Wednesday.
Barr told members of a Senate Appropriations Committee panel that he wants to understand how and why key decisions were made about the counterintelligence investigation opened by the FBI in the summer of 2016.
He said he isn't ""putting a panel together"" and the effort may not result in a criminal investigation or the finding of a crime.
But the attorney general did say he has taken seriously some of the criticisms by Republican supporters of President Trump about the way the FBI and Justice Department conducted the investigation.
""I feel an obligation to make sure government power is not abused,"" Barr said. ""I think that is one of the principal roles of the attorney general.""
National Security Barr: Mueller Report Out Within 1 Week; IG Report On Russia Inquiry This Summer Alleged abuse of power and alleged bias by the FBI and DOJ have been long-standing themes of Trump and allies since special counsel Robert Mueller was commissioned to investigate whether Trump's campaign colluded with the Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election .
The special counsel's office did not establish that , Barr has said, nor did it establish that Trump broke the law in trying to frustrate the investigation.
National Security Mueller Report Doesn't Find Russian Collusion, But Can't 'Exonerate' On Obstruction The basis for those conclusions is not yet public, but Barr said Congress and Americans will be able to read much of Mueller's report for themselves when it's released next week.
Barr's office is working with Mueller's team to redact it.
Politics READ: The Justice Department's Summary Of The Mueller Report Trump and Republicans have sought to exploit the tailwind they feel they got last month from Barr's summary about Mueller's findings .
The attorney general's testimony on Wednesday confirmed they have an ally at the Justice Department who may help with reviving questions about investigators' practices now that the worst political peril from Mueller apparently has passed.
Early decisions
Past subcontroversies about the Russia investigation have involved the FBI's use of confidential informants to approach people in contact with Russians in 2016; questions about what briefings were made to Trump or people in his circle; and investigators' use of surveillance powers.
Barr told Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., for example, that ""spying did occur"" on the 2016 Trump campaign — the question he wants to answer now is whether it was ""adequately predicated.""
Barr later clarified to Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., that he has no ""specific evidence"" about abuse of power or improper surveillance. What he has, he said, are ""questions about it. ... I have concerns about various aspects of it.""
National Security The Mueller Report Is Getting A Lot Of Attention. Here's How We Got Here Why, for example, wasn't Trump briefed explicitly about the contacts his staffers were making with Russians at the time the FBI became concerned enough about it to open its counterintelligence investigation?
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., described a case in which counterintelligence officials became worried that a man working for Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., might have problematic ties to the Chinese government . Feinstein was briefed and the man was fired, Graham said. Why weren't Trump or his team briefed in that same way?
""That is one question I have,"" Barr said. ""Normally the campaign would have been advised of this. I'm interested in getting that answer.""
National Security The Russia Investigations: What You Need To Know About Russian 'Active Measures' Trump's campaign even included two former United States attorneys, Barr said — Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani — people familiar with law enforcement and well known to the Justice Department. The attorney general said he wants to find out what notifications were made to the team and why.
Although Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton received counterintelligence briefings about the threat of infiltration by foreign spies, it isn't clear what they were told.
National Security Get Caught Up On The Russia Investigation: The 'Collusion' Question In the summer of 2016 when some briefings reportedly happened, the FBI's investigation — which began in late July — might have been only a few weeks or even days old and might have been too closely held to have been the subject of one of these briefings.
Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., praised the FBI as an entity but said he thought it has become clear that a few bad individuals had made highly consequential decisions in deploying it against Trump and his camp.
Kennedy also said it has become obvious how disappointed Trump's opponents are in Barr's summary of Mueller's report, as evidenced by their new focus on the report itself and some expectation that it could still damage the president. The country must move on, he argued.
""You're only young once, but you can always be immature,"" he said.
Democrats were infuriated by what they called the return of suggestions about snooping or abuse of power that already have been put to rest in earlier phases of the Russia imbroglio.
Democrats enraged
""I don't trust Barr, I trust Mueller,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told The Associated Press in an interview on Wednesday.
The attorney general has a duty to be independent, Pelosi said, not serve as a political operative working on behalf of the president.
""How very, very dismaying and disappointing that the chief law enforcement officer of our country is going off the rails yesterday and today,"" Pelosi said at a press conference. ""He is the attorney general of the United States of America, not the attorney general of Donald Trump.""
Sen. Mark Warner, who does not sit on the appropriations subcommittee before which Barr appeared on Wednesday but is vice chair of the Senate intelligence committee, responded on Twitter to what he called Barr's irresponsible airing of conspiracy theories.
Russia really did attack the 2016 presidential election, Warner pointed out, and that obviously merited a serious investigation then and today. ""Giving a wink and a nod to this long-debunked 'spying' conspiracy theory is irresponsible,"" the Virginia Democrat also wrote.
Mr. Barr knows how counter-intel investigations work. He knows there was ample evidence of Russian attempts to infiltrate the Trump campaign and that the FBI took lawful action to stop it. Giving a wink and a nod to this long-debunked “spying” conspiracy theory is irresponsible.
— Mark Warner (@MarkWarner) April 10, 2019 Surveillance powers
Trump and his allies have focused much of their criticism of the FBI and DOJ on the warrant that authorities sought in 2016 to conduct surveillance on a junior campaign foreign policy aide, Carter Page.
At least some of the information that underpinned the request came from a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, who also was the author of the infamous Russia dossier .
National Security What You Need To Know About The Russia Investigations: The Dossier Steele's work ultimately was underwritten by Democrats, and because the dossier remains unverified — and, in some cases, its contents have been debunked — critics charge that Page's rights were violated.
Applications to reauthorize the surveillance continued into the Trump administration and two were signed by Trump appointees, suggesting that the collection yielded enough foreign intelligence to merit the subsequent requests to keep it going.
National Security What Else Could Robert Mueller's Report Reveal About Trump And Russia? What has never been clear is what — apart from the material in the dossier about Page — investigators might have uncovered. That may be covered in the Mueller report. Speaking to a House appropriations subcommittee, Barr also said on Tuesday that the use of surveillance would be the subject of a report this summer by DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz.
Page has not been charged with any crime and has maintained all along that he did nothing wrong.
National Security All The Criminal Charges To Emerge From Robert Mueller's Investigation Three other Trump aides who were the subject of investigation by the FBI in the early stage of the investigation — national security adviser Michael Flynn; campaign chairman Paul Manafort; and another junior foreign policy aide, George Papadopoulos — all faced criminal charges , although none were accused of conspiring with the Russian interference.
Democrats press Barr
Trump's opponents asked Barr whether he had any evidence about inappropriate steps taken by the FBI or the Justice Department — no, the attorney general said, just some of the unanswered questions posed at the hearing.
Democrats also asked Barr whether he has briefed anyone in the Trump administration about the Mueller report or given copies to the White House.
The attorney general didn't address that directly, nor did he offer any details about how he had reached the conclusions he summarized for Congress in his letters last month.
""Once the report is out I'm happy to discuss the process,"" Barr said.

Stephen Lovekin/FilmMagic On Tuesday, President Trump tweeted out a video. He gave no explanation of what it was or where it came from — just an exhortation to ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""
The video was odd — it opened with footage of various Washington landmarks interspersed with clips of Barack Obama and Hillary and Bill Clinton. Then came clips of Trump visiting a factory, Trump meeting with Kim Jong Un, the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing, and clips of actors Rosie O'Donnell, Bryan Cranston and Amy Schumer, mixed in with shots of Trump at campaign rallies.
As a dramatic score played, words appeared on the screen: ""First they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they call you racist. Donald J. Trump. Your vote. Proved them all wrong. Trump: The Great Victory 2020.""
Just a few hours later, the video was taken down from YouTube.

In a statement, Warner Bros. said that the video's use of its music was unauthorized: ""We are working through the appropriate legal channels to have it removed.""
Trump later deleted the tweet. As of Wednesday afternoon, near-copies of the video were still on YouTube.
The video was apparently not created by the Trump campaign but rather by a fan. ""The video was made by a supporter,"" a campaign aide told CNN . ""We like to share content from diehard supporters, and this is just another example of how hard Trump supporters fight for the President.""

The account that posted the video to the r/The_Donald subreddit wrote Tuesday that the video was made a couple of weeks ago, and its creator was shocked and delighted when Trump shared it.
""I'm honored,"" the person wrote. ""My dad has [Trump's] tweet printed so I can frame it.""
Artists including Neil Young , Pharrell Williams and the estate of Prince have all previously demanded that the Trump campaign stop playing their music, complaining that their songs had been used without permission.

"Among Migrant Families And Children, Fake Documents A Growing Problem",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711850056/fake-documents-a-growing-problem-among-migrants-crossing-u-s-mexico-border?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Kirstjen Nielsen, then Homeland Security Secretary, is sworn in in March to testify on Capitol Hill before the House Homeland Security Committee.

Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP Kirstjen Nielsen, then Homeland Security Secretary, is sworn in in March to testify on Capitol Hill before the House Homeland Security Committee. She testified that ""cases of fake families are cropping up everywhere,"" among the surge of migrants at the Southern border.
Susan Walsh/AP Immigration agents say they have encountered more ""faux families"" among the growing number of Central American migrants sweeping across the southern border.
Federal agents have identified more than 3,100 people making fraudulent claims over the past 12 months. This includes migrants who claim to be children, but who are actually 18 or older, as well as adults who falsely claim to be parents of minors they're traveling with, according to Brian Hastings, chief of law enforcement operations for Customs and Border Enforcement.
Border agents encountered more than 103,000 unauthorized migrants crossing the border during March — nearly 6 out of 10 were family members. President Trump said last week the surge is ""overwhelming our immigration system. We can't take you any more. Our country is full.""
Repeating a common refrain that undocumented migrants are criminals, administration officials claim that false parents are exploiting and endangering the children they bring. But migrants have a simpler explanation: they're not mistreating the kids and they're both coming for a better life.
The number of fraudulent claims identified — 3,100 — represents less than .5 percent of the total number of apprehensions in the past year.
Kirstjen Nielsen, then Homeland Security secretary, told a congressional committee last month: ""Cases of fake families are cropping up everywhere and children are being used as pawns."" She said investigators had uncovered ""child recycling rings, a process in which innocent children are used multiple times to help migrants gain illegal entry.""
Nielsen abruptly resigned on April 7 over differences with the president about how to control illegal immigration.
In her congressional testimony, she appeared to be singling out one notorious case that occurred in Charleston, S.C., involving a Guatemalan woman who was part of a human trafficking ring. Officials say the woman paired immigrant children with adults back in Guatemala who are not their parents. They would present themselves at the U.S. border knowing that parents and children traveling together are usually released. Adult immigrants who travel alone are usually detained or quickly deported.
CBP Associate Intelligence Chief Carl McClafferty described the South Carolina case in an appearance with Nielsen and the president last month at the White House. He said that the woman was paid $1,500 a child, ""to take the children back to Guatemala who are not part of the actual family unit. She tried to do this 13 times."" Local offices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. attorney declined to provide details about the case, because the Guatemalan woman has not been convicted.
National Coyotes' Boomtown: Picking Up The Migrant Trail On The Way To The U.S.-Mexico Border National Trump Administration Mulls Tougher Immigration Policies Amid DHS Shake-Up Child recycling cases are rare. Homeland Security officials could not come up with another case other than the Charleston indictment.
Fake documents at the border, however, have become more common. In the Yuma, Ariz., Border Patrol sector alone, there have been more than 450 instances of ""fraudulent family units"" since October, according to a local spokesman.
In El Paso, Texas, Border Patrol Special Operations Supervisor Ramiro Cordero has noticed it, too. ""We found cases where adults have been coming in with kids who are not their kids, yet they're claiming that they're their children. We found birth certificates that have been forged,"" Cordero says.
When agents in El Paso suspect a Guatemalan birth certificate is fishy, they send it to that country's consul in Del Rio, Texas. Officials there check the document's authenticity with the database of the Guatemalan National Persons Registry.

He says it's an additional service provided by organizations that work for human smugglers.
John Burnett/NPR Guatemalan Consul Tekandi Paniagua says he's not aware of any recycled children.
""Unfortunately,"" he says, ""the consulate has detected lots of fake identity documents in recent months."" Paniagua says in most of the cases they've investigated, the pair involves an adult neighbor or relative who is not the parent, and a child who is willfully traveling with them. In many cases, he says, immigrant parents already in the United States pay for fake documents for an adult traveling companion to bring their children.
The consul says the price for fake documents ranges from $200 to $700. He called it ""an additional service provided by organizations that work for human smugglers.""
In some cases, it's a bogus document with the wrong watermark, wrong stamp and wrong agency logo. In other cases, the document is authentic, but a name or an age has been changed. The consulate staff has also come across cases where a young adult altered their birth date to appear to be under 18 years old. Migrant children 17 and under are sent to federally-contracted youth shelters where living conditions are much more benign than adult detention.
With the large numbers of immigrants wading across the Rio Grande into El Paso, border agents have apprehended as many as 1,000 family members a day. A majority come from Guatemala. Paniagua says the consulate is identifying about a dozen sham birth certificates every day.
When federal agents on the front lines encounter some immigrant family units, even before they examine birth documents, they can tell something is not right.
""A young man has arrived with a small child. He had no diapers, no bottle, nothing. He did not even know how to feed the child,"" says Monica Mapel, assistant agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in San Antonio. ""So that tells me that's not your child. You're not a father who's been caring for that child.""
Mapel has begun to explore whether faux family schemes are mostly a matter of traditional illegal immigration or child exploitation.
""Is it continuation of human smuggling? Or is it worse — human trafficking?"" she says. ""As an investigator my mind is wide open."""

toggle caption Juan Camilo Bernal/Getty Images Close to 2.2 million people were incarcerated in the U.S. in 2016; author Emily Bazelon says prosecutors — not judges — are responsible for many of the prison sentences defendants receive.
Juan Camilo Bernal/Getty Images The U.S. prison population is booming. It is estimated nearly 2.2 million people were incarcerated in America in 2016, and as many people in the U.S. have criminal records as have graduated from four-year colleges.
Journalist and Yale Law lecturer Emily Bazelon attributes America's high incarceration rates to prosecutors more than judges. She says that in the 1980s, when crime was on the rise, legislators across the country passed laws with mandatory minimum sentences that have disproportionately affected black and brown communities.
""That set up prosecutors to be able to determine the punishment by the charge they bring in,"" Bazelon says. ""And so we're still living with that change — even though crime has really fallen since that time.""
Bazelon notes that the majority of court cases — more than 90 percent — end in a plea bargain rather than a trial, which gives prosecutors even more power.
""You see this kind of haggling over plea bargains in the hallway, not an open court,"" she says. As for a defendant's guilt and innocence? ""Honestly, people don't even really talk about those things.""
Bazelon spent 2 1/2 years reporting on the Brooklyn district attorney's office. Her new book, Charged, examines the power of prosecutors and looks at alternatives to bail, plea bargains and incarceration.

Amazon Independent Booksellers On why so many cases end in plea bargains
Plea bargains keep the system moving much more quickly. They are far less time-consuming in terms of hours in court than a trial. And so you've really seen them take over the system. Justice Anthony Kennedy several years ago said for the Supreme Court that plea bargains were not an adjunct to the system, they really had become the entire system. When you think about the criminal justice system the founders of our country designed, that's just a sea change. Trial by jury — it's in the Constitution, written into the Sixth Amendment, [but there's] nothing about plea bargains.
On how prosecutors' focus on winning convictions is linked to mass incarceration
We put prosecutors in this arguably difficult position. We tell them that it's their job to win convictions. We also tell them that they are obligated to be ministers of justice. Good prosecutors know how to balance those ethical responsibilities, but it's not always easy to curb your instinct to win. And so I think when prosecutors abuse their power, what we're seeing is a real tension in this dual nature of their role.
On the ways the criminal justice system unfairly targets poor people
We have so many people who've gotten tangled up in the criminal justice system. And for misdemeanor offenses, often we're not talking about jail or prison sentences, but we are talking about other consequences where you have this notation on your record that can really affect the opportunities that you have going out from there.
Shots - Health News Former Physician At Rikers Island Exposes Health Risks Of Incarceration So I think those costs are leading people in the reform movement to really question why we criminalize certain behavior and not others. So for example, fare beating, turnstile jumping: Those are things people get arrested for. Well, if you're a driver of a car, a more middle-class person, [and] you blow through an E-Z Pass on the highway, you're not going to get arrested. You're going to get a fine. So we have different ways of punishing different classes of people for minor kinds of wrongdoing that have a tremendous impact on people's lives.
On how bail works
Here's how for-profit cash bail works in New York: You go in front of a judge; say he sets bail at $15,000. That's standard for a gun offense. You then can pay it at that moment if you have the cash, but of course most people don't have that amount of cash sitting around. And so then they have to go to a bail bondsman.
Law Is America Engaged In A 'Vicious Circle' Of Jailing The Poor? Usually, you work out a deal where you pay the bondsman 10 percent. Then the bondsman doesn't actually pay the court anything. They just go to the court and say we'll guarantee that if this person flees we will pay that amount. At the end of the case, if you have come to all your court appearances as almost everyone does, you're supposed to get your money back at the end. But I did not see people getting any more than, like, $60, $50 back when they completed this process. ...
But, in fact, we know from Washington, D.C., which has been doing it differently for years; from the state of Kentucky, which has a different system, that cash bail is not necessary to bring most people back to court. Most people, you just ask them politely to come back to court. You send them reminders, you connect them with support services if necessary and they'll come back, because they know it's going to be bad for them to have a warrant out there for their arrest.
On what happens to defendants who cannot afford bail
If you can't make bail, you go to jail. And we have probably about 6 million people every year in America who are sitting in jail because they can't afford to post bail and get out, sometimes for very minor offenses.
This is just a hidden cost of our system that we've tolerated for a long time. The question I would ask about it is why people are sitting in jail if they don't pose a threat to safety? ... I mean, if you are accused of marijuana possession, for example, and the judge asked you to post bail and you're poor and you can't post it, well you're going to jail where someone who was better off would not go to jail, and that has nothing to do with public safety. ...
We really have a system that treats people differently based on the amount of money they have — and that seems fundamentally wrong, and yet it drives our whole pretrial system.
Emily Bazelon
We really have a system that treats people differently based on the amount of money they have — and that seems fundamentally wrong, and yet it drives our whole pretrial system.
On the new reform movement to curtail mass incarceration
This is a new movement that has really bubbled up in a bunch of cities since 2016. What you see here are people who want to reduce and end mass incarceration, realizing that they have the power to elect a new kind of prosecutor. These are local elections; voters decide [who the district attorney is], and if you're organized, you can have a big impact on these races.
So then these new DAs have come into office and they answer to a different constituency. It's not the old, you know, drum beating of law and order. The people who voted for them are saying, ""We want the system to be more fair, to treat victims and defendants better. We want prison and jail to be a last resort rather than the default all the time.""
And so these prosecutors are using their discretion in a different way to try to change the system. They can change the way they charge people. They can stop asking for bail in a lot of circumstances or all circumstances. They can decriminalize certain offenses, like jumping a turnstile or possessing marijuana. So you're seeing the great power that prosecutors have harnessed in a new and different way.

toggle caption Tyler Evert/AP West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice delivers his State of the State speech on Jan. 9 in Charleston, W.Va. Mining companies belonging to the Justice family owe millions in safety violations.
Tyler Evert/AP West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice promised to wipe out his family's debt from mine safety violations when he ran for governor in 2016. Instead, that debt has more than doubled since NPR first reported on it in 2014, amounting to millions of dollars.
""We'll absolutely ... make sure that every one of [the debts] is taken care of,"" Justice said at a news conference announcing his campaign for governor.
The Justice companies owe more than $4 million to the federal government, according to a new Ohio Valley ReSource analysis of federal data. That's the highest delinquent mine safety debt in the U.S. mining industry — and those unpaid violations have been a chronic problem for the Justice family for years, despite many promises to pay.
In 2014, an NPR investigation showed Justice companies owed just under $2 million in delinquent federal mine safety penalties, which are levied by the Mine Safety and Health Administration . Two years later, when Jim Justice was running for governor, the companies' debt had climbed to $2.6 million, according to a follow-up NPR investigation .
Source: MSHA Debt by Age data Alexandra Kanik/Ohio Valley ReSource hide caption
toggle caption Alexandra Kanik/Ohio Valley ReSource By the end of 2018, the Justice companies — now mainly controlled by the governor's children, James Justice III and Jillean Justice — owed millions more in delinquent mine safety penalties. Their delinquent debt ballooned to $4.3 million, according to the ReSource data analysis. The data were originally obtained by NPR's Howard Berkes through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.
""[Gov. Justice] and his family has simply chosen to disregard, flagrantly violate, continually violate and increasingly violate the rules of mine safety and the penalties of mine safety,"" says Davitt McAteer, a former head of MSHA during the Clinton administration.
The delinquent penalties were accrued by the Justice companies between June 2009 and August 2018 at 71 mines in Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Virginia. Collectively, the Justice companies' unpaid fines and penalties account for nearly 10 percent of all delinquent debt owed by mining companies in the country.
The governor's office did not respond to requests for comment. The Justice companies referred questions to attorney Richard Getty, who represents the company in Kentucky. In a statement, Getty touted the company's safety record, despite owing millions in unpaid mine safety fines and violations.
""The Justice Group is also very proud to report that its accident and incident history of currently operated mines is very favorable,"" he stated.
Delinquent Mines Coal Mines Keep Operating Despite Injuries, Violations And Millions In Fines Delinquent Mines Billionaire Gubernatorial Candidate Owes $15 Million In Taxes And Fines The ReSource analysis found injury rates at delinquent Justice mines fall close to the national industry average. However, that does not mean those mines were free of unsafe conditions. From 2009 to 2019, Justice mines had 5,560 violations for things like failing to maintain equipment, accumulation of combustible materials, and failure to develop and follow ventilation plans.
About one-third of violations issued at delinquent Justice mines were listed as what MSHA calls ""Significant and Substantial,"" meaning the observed conditions at the mine present a reasonable likelihood that an injury or illness will occur. Nine violations were for conditions that federal regulators say placed miners in ""imminent danger"" of death or serious physical harm.
Getty, the attorney, acknowledged the $4.3 million in unpaid fines. But he said the company ""vehemently denies responsibility for this total."" According to Getty, a ""very significant portion"" of the penalties occurred at mines operated by a Russian company prior to their acquisition by the Justice family.
That's a claim Justice, his attorneys and spokesmen have made in the past. But the NPR and ReSource analyses of the federal data show none of the unpaid fines were incurred when mines were operated by the Russian company. The current $4.3 million in delinquent penalties are associated only with mines owned by the Justice companies when they owned them.
That was confirmed by an MSHA spokesperson in response to a direct question: The regulatory and enforcement agency ""stands by its assessment of fines and penalties for the Justice companies.""
Getty also claimed the Justices were ""currently involved in negotiations"" with MSHA to ""reach a fair and reasonable settlement."" But in a statement, MSHA said that's not true: The agency is not ""currently involved in negotiations with the Justice group.""
Investigations An Epidemic Is Killing Thousands Of Coal Miners. Regulators Could Have Stopped It Investigations 'I Figured It Was Going To Be A Horrible Death, And It Probably Will Be' While the Justice-owned companies are the top delinquents, they are not the only mining companies in the region that fail to pay their fines and penalties. Thousands of the country's mine operators continue to not pay fines assessed for health and safety violations. MSHA is owed more than $45 million in overdue fines, some as old as 1994, according to the ReSource analysis.
Delinquent mines represent about 8 percent of the nation's more than 40,000 coal, metal and nonmetal mines. Among the country's active coal mines, 23 percent are delinquent.
Working in mines that fail to pay penalties has potentially major impacts to the health and safety of miners. Injury rates for miners working in delinquent underground coal mines are 31 percent higher than rates at mines that are not currently delinquent, according to the ReSource analysis.
Mine inspections and citations exist to protect the nation's coal miners, says Patrick McGinley, a professor of environmental law at West Virginia University.
""Any friend of coal has to admit that there is no greater responsibility of a coal operator than to protect the lives of miners,"" he says. ""The failure to pay civil penalties is a way of saying, 'Safety doesn't matter. We don't care, we can get away with it.' ""

Fisher-Price has issued an immediate recall of all models of its Rock 'n Play baby sleeper, according to a news release from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission . Fisher-Price, which has sold approximately 4.7 million of these sleepers, is advising that consumers stop using the product immediately and contact the company for a refund or voucher.
""Since 2009, there have been more than 30 infant deaths involving the Rock 'n Play,"" the commission's acting chair, Ann Marie Buerkle , said in a statement.
""This issue has been a top priority for the agency. CPSC has been investigating incidents and analyzing the data regarding how they relate to this product. In addition, CPSC is continuing our investigation into other inclined sleep products.""
Fisher-Price General Manager Chuck Scothon said in an emailed statement that the company ""stand[s] by the safety of our products.""
""However, due to reported incidents in which the product was used contrary to the safety warnings and instructions, we have decided to conduct a voluntary recall of the Rock 'n Play Sleeper in partnership with the Consumer Product Safety Commission,"" he wrote.
On Wednesday, the federal agency tasked with regulating consumer products said it had ""identified a hazard with rollover issues,"" in which babies move onto their stomachs or sides and can't return to their back. That same day, Scothon defended the product in an emailed statement, saying the company ""stand[s] by the safety of the Rock 'n Play Sleeper,"" which he said meets all applicable safety standards.
But on Friday, the company reached an agreement with the CPSC to recall the product.
Earlier in the month, Fisher-Price and the agency had jointly issued a warning recommending that consumers stop using the sleeper by the time their babies are 3 months old or when they begin to be capable of rolling over. Now they are advising that parents immediately stop using it.
Shots - Health News As Injuries Continue, Doctors Renew Call For Ban On Infant Walkers An investigation by Consumer Reports found that the sleepers were tied to the deaths of 32 babies. According to the report, the deaths can be traced back to the crib's inclined design.
""If the baby's head falls forward or to the side it compresses the trachea and that limits the oxygen that they can take in,"" said Rachel Peachman, a deputy of special projects at Consumer Reports and author of the investigation. ""We believe that it is not a safe product for parents to use for infants of any age, and the safest thing to do is to recall the product immediately.""
The American Academy of Pediatrics called for a recall of the product. Ben Hoffman, a pediatrician and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Injury, Violence and Poison Prevention, said he has had ""significant concerns"" about the Rock 'n Play sleeper for a long time.
""We know the safest place for a baby to sleep is on a flat, firm surface,"" he said. ""It's not safe for a baby to sleep at an angle, whether it's a car seat or a swing.""
Hoffman said he has found Rock 'n Play sleepers to be ""incredibly popular"" with families he works with, who believe that the incline can help babies who have trouble sleeping owing to acid reflux. According to Fisher-Price's website , this is exactly how the idea for the Rock 'n Play originated — a mom looking to make a product that would allow her spit-up-prone baby to sleep through the night.
But Hoffman said studies have shown sleeping at an angle can actually make reflux worse for babies. Combine that with the risk of suffocation, and Hoffman said the Fisher-Price product ""is just not a safe sleep environment.""
""I would urge every family that has one to never use it again,"" he said. ""That's why [the AAP] feels ... a recall is really important."""
Most Semi-Automatic Weapons Banned In New Zealand After Massacre : NPR,www.npr.org,Matthew S. Schwartz,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711820023/new-zealand-passes-law-banning-most-semi-automatic-weapons,"Enlarge this image

Less than one month after a gunman killed 50 people in an attack on two mosques in Christchurch, the New Zealand Parliament voted Wednesday to ban most semi-automatic and military-style weapons.
The law makes it illegal to possess the prohibited weapons in New Zealand. Current owners of the now-banned firearms will have until the end of September to return their weapons for compensation under a buyback program. If they don't return them, they could face up to five years in prison.
Speaking before lawmakers , Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she knew her country would approve a ban after the police commissioner described the deadly nature of the guns used in the attack, which had been obtained legally and easily modified to hold more than 60 bullets per magazine.
""I could not fathom how weapons that could cause such destruction and large-scale death could have been obtained legally in this country,"" Ardern said.
She described visits to hospitals where dozens of victims are still recovering.
""I struggle to recall any single gunshot wounds,"" she said. ""In every case they spoke of multiple injuries. Multiple debilitating injuries that deemed it impossible for them to recover in days, let alone weeks. They will carry disabilities for a lifetime, and that's before you consider the psychological impact.""
According to the text of the legislation, it ""seeks to remove semi-automatic firearms from circulation and use ... in New Zealand."" It bans ""semi-automatic firearms, magazines, and parts that can be used to assemble prohibited firearms,"" as well as certain ammunition. ""Military style"" weapons will also be banned.
The law makes some exceptions. Semi-automatic firearms up to .22 caliber that can hold up to 10 rounds will be permitted, as will magazines for shotguns that can hold up to five cartridges. Licensed dealers, pest controllers and ""bona fide collectors"" will also enjoy ""narrow exceptions"" to the ban.
Ardern told lawmakers she couldn't face the victims left behind and tell them she was OK with such dangerous weapons being legal to purchase in New Zealand.
""Fifty people died and they do not have a voice. We in this house are their voice,"" Ardern said on the floor of Parliament. ""We have used that voice wisely,"" she said to applause from lawmakers.
The bill, which passed 119-1, will become law by the end of the week, the New Zealand news site Stuff reported. The one dissenter, David Seymour of the ACT Party, criticized the speed at which lawmakers had moved without public input. ""Trying to make complex legislation in nine days is madness,"" Seymour wrote . ""If it was effective, we would rush all legislation, but it is not.""
In response to complaints about the process, Ardern said: ""You either believe that in New Zealand these weapons have a place or you do not. And if you believe, like us, that they do not, you should be able to agree that we can move swiftly. My view is that an argument about process is an argument to do nothing.""
The speed at which New Zealand moved to ban the weapons stands in contrast with U.S. inaction at the federal level after mass shootings. Despite calls by some lawmakers for similar bans, it has proved difficult to impose major restrictions on gun ownership."
Oregon Officers Say Burglary Suspect Turns Out To Be Industrious Roomba Vacuum,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711819433/oregon-man-called-police-about-a-burglar-armed-officers-found-a-rogue-roomba,"Enlarge this image Three seasoned deputies — one with at least 20 years on the force — a detective who happened to be in the area, and two canine officers all responded to the call of a burglary in progress at a Cedar Hills home near Portland, Ore. Instead, they found a trapped robotic vacuum cleaner. Washington County sheriff Washington County sheriff Three seasoned deputies — one with at least 20 years on the force — a detective who happened to be in the area, and two canine officers all responded to the call of a burglary in progress at a Cedar Hills home near Portland, Ore. Instead, they found a trapped robotic vacuum cleaner.
Washington County sheriff The Washington County sheriff in Oregon says there was nothing unusual about the call. Sure, it was broad daylight — 1:48 p.m. local time exactly — but ""crime can happen anytime.""
So the frantic call from a house guest about a burglar making loud rustling noises inside the house, specifically from within the locked bathroom, deserved an urgent response, Sgt. Danny DiPietro, a sheriff's spokesman, tells NPR.
""The man had just gone for a walk with his nephew's dog and when he came back, he could see shadows moving back and forth under the bathroom door,"" DiPietro says.
Resources were immediately deployed: three seasoned deputies — one with at least 20 years on the force — a detective who happened to be in the area, and two canine officers from Beaverton Police Department, about 7 miles outside Portland.
They surrounded the Cedar Hills house, then made their way inside, guns unholstered. ""And the whole time they were yelling, 'Sheriff' and 'Police' but the burglar wouldn't come out. He wouldn't say anything,"" DiPietro says.
Instead, the banging got louder. ""Like a loud thud, thud, thud on glass."" Officers assumed the burglar was trying to escape. ""That he was trying to open a window and jump out and run away.""
Hearts pounding, guns ready to fire, they counted down and entered the bathroom. But instead of confronting a suspect, they found ... a rogue Roomba robot vacuum that was apparently doing ""a very thorough"" job.
""It was just this little round machine, slamming against the glass [shower] wall,"" DiPietro says.
The entire group erupted into peals of laughter.
""Everyone just started cracking up. It was such huge relief because it's the kind of situation that could go either way. It could end peacefully or ..."" DiPietro trailed off. ""No one had any idea what was waiting for them behind the door but they definitely didn't expect that.""
DiPietro, who has been on the force for 13 years and has some experience working with canine officers, says the responding officers were especially perplexed by the lack of response when they said a dog was outside the bathroom door.
""That was confusing because usually, when you say, 'We've got a dog,' people are done. They're like, 'OK, I'm not fighting a dog!' and they'll just give up,"" he says.
The fact that the individual inside the bathroom didn't do that was chilling, he added.
From start to finish the incident took 25 minutes, according to a play-by-play post on the department's Facebook page.
As for the man who reported the call, DiPietro said he felt ""awful.""
""But I would have done the exact same thing if I was visiting someone and didn't know there was a robot vacuum cleaner that was set to go off on its own. And even the responding officers, when they saw the shadow under the door and the sound of someone trying to get out ... well, they fell for it too,"" he added.
Plus, DiPietro says, the sheriff's office Facebook followers are loving the story, coming up with punny reports of their own as well as demands to see the bodycam footage.
""After sweeping the premises, the perpetrator was nabbed. Later, the room was dusted for prints,"" Richard Cox commented.
Marti McCleskey offered a compliment: ""Great job catching the sucker!"""

Scientists Have Taken The First Photo Of Something That's Invisible — A Black Hole : NPR,www.npr.org,Nell Greenfieldboyce,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711951875/scientists-have-taken-the-first-photo-of-something-thats-invisible-a-black-hole,"Scientists Have Taken The First Photo Of Something That's Invisible — A Black Hole Scientists Have Taken The First Photo Of Something That's Invisible — A Black Hole Embed Embed
The swirling mass around a black hole is called an ""event horizon,"" the point of no return beyond which not even light can escape. Scientists unveiled the first image of this on Wednesday.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Scientists have taken the first photo of something invisible - a black hole. For decades, black holes have captured people's imaginations.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: There is an inexorable force in the cosmos where time and space converge.
SHAPIRO: That's the trailer for the 1979 movie ""The Black Hole."" Well, today researchers unveiled what a black hole really looks like. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce was there.
(CROSSTALK)
NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The press briefing in Washington, D.C., was packed.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of making sure the fire marshal does not have any issues, I need a clear lane for...
GREENFIELDBOYCE: Two kinds of people were milling around - folks who were dying to see the black hole photo and scientists who weren't allowed to show them yet. Feryal Ozel was one of the latter. She's an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona.
FERYAL OZEL: I have seen these images. I've worked a lot on these images and the interpretations.
GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ozel says a black hole is like a cosmic vacuum with such strong gravity that it sucks up everything.
OZEL: We have no other object quite like a black hole. It just distorts the space-time around it, and in the interior, it distorts it so much that even light is trapped. So it is the absence of light that we're looking for.
GREENFIELDBOYCE: People sat down, and speakers took the stage, including Sheperd Doeleman of Harvard, who led this effort. It involved about 200 people in 20 countries. In 2017, they used eight radio telescopes around the world to peer at the center of a galaxy around 50 million light years away, a place where a black hole is thought to be lurking.
SHEPERD DOELEMAN: We have seen what we thought was unseeable. We have seen and taken a picture of a black hole.
GREENFIELDBOYCE: And then what looks like a blurry ring of fire appeared on a screen above him.
DOELEMAN: Here it is.
(APPLAUSE)
GREENFIELDBOYCE: Some high school students were in the audience. I asked Ana Humphrey (ph) how she'd describe this photo.
ANA HUMPHREY: There's definitely, like, a dark shadow - a circular shadow in the center of the image. And then around the black hole, there's this sort of orangey halo.
GREENFIELDBOYCE: The halo being bright gasses swirling towards oblivion. Her schoolmate Gregory Durkin (ph) was glad to see something that matched the predictions of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.
GREGORY DURKIN: So I was not surprised, but it was a great, great pleasure and privilege to see a black hole and live in the generation that can see it first.
GREENFIELDBOYCE: Scientists plan to use more telescopes to get better close-ups of this black hole and others like it. Sera Markoff is an astrophysicist at the University of Amsterdam.
SERA MARKOFF: It's just the beginning, you know? You can think of it as a picture, but it's also one of the most profound things humanity has ever seen.
GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says to her, it's like looking into the pit of nothingness, one of the most fundamental mysteries of the universe. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. Copyright © 2019 NPR.
