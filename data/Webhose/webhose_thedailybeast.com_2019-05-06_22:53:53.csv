Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar is currently on a media swing touting the Trump Administration’s pledge to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030. But given the administration’s actions to create a federal judiciary wholly inhospitable to both accessible health care and the LGBTQ community, this is breathtaking hypocrisy—and Azar should know it.
While Azar is pitching the plan to halt new HIV infections and end AIDS, the administration seems to be doing everything within its power to undermine that goal. Yes, the President’s budget has requested $291 million in additional funding for HIV treatment and prevention, but that modest increase is largely overshadowed by staggering cuts to other critical HIV-related programs, not to mention the administration’s efforts to halt Medicaid expansion. For example, Trump’s budget takes out $1.3 billion for the President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief. And all of this is happening while the administration is steadily pursuing a court-focused strategy to eliminate access to health care for tens of millions—including those with pre-existing conditions like HIV.
The court strategy is brazen and two-pronged: 1) Pack the federal courts with judges whose records show hostility to the Affordable Care Act and its promise of Medicaid expansion and coverage for preexisting conditions; and 2) Deploy political appointees in the Department of Justice to advocate for the dismantling of the ACA in court.

Colbert Rips Trump After Mueller Report: Innocent People Don’t Say ‘I’m F*cked’ ‘That’s actually what I said at the beginning of your presidency,’ the ‘Late Show’ host joked.
Stephen Colbert brought all 448 pages of the Mueller report on stage for his monologue Thursday night.
“You know how for a couple of years you’ve been thinking, ‘There’s probably bad stuff in the Mueller report that makes Donald Trump look terrible?’” the Late Show host asked. “But then three weeks ago, Attorney General Bill Barr put out his four-page valentine to Donald Trump, and then you thought, ‘Maybe I’m crazy?’ Well, if you just returned to this dimension from the phantom zone, today the Mueller report was released. And I’m here to tell you, you’re not crazy.”
Colbert had so much to say about the day’s big news that he actually delivered two full monologues about it, with a commercial break in between. And he began with the attorney general’s “one-man no collusion spectacular” press conference, which prompted numerous pundits—including one from Fox News —to say that Barr was acting more like Trump’s personal attorney than the head of the country’s Justice Department.
“That’s not fair,” Colbert replied. “If Bill Barr were the president’s attorney, he’d be in prison right now.”
As for Barr’s assertion that Trump’s attempted obstruction of justice could be forgiven because he was “frustrated” by the special counsel probe, the host asked, “Wait, when did feelings become a get-out-of-jail-free card? ‘Sure, my client’s actions might look like arson, but may I remind you, he was feeling tense, and who doesn’t relax in front of a roaring fire?’”
“And if you needed any more proof that this was just a thinly disguised, coordinated campaign event,” the host added, “the instant Barr’s press conference ended Trump tweeted this Game of Thrones -themed image saying, ‘No collusion. No obstruction. For the haters and the radical left Democrats—Game Over.’”
“That picture, by the way, is Trump posing next to all the smoke that William Barr just blew up his ass,” Colbert joked.
And Colbert seemed genuinely surprised that Barr did not redact the portion of the Mueller report in which Trump reacted to the appointment of the special counsel by declaring, “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I’m fucked.”
“That’s actually what I said at the beginning of your presidency,” Colbert said. “And I’m guessing that’s not how an innocent person reacts.” He imagined someone whose spouse suspects them of cheating and instantly replies, “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of our marriage. I’m fucked.” READ THIS LIST"
Jimmy Kimmel: Only Don Jr. Could Be ‘Too Stupid to Collude’,www.thedailybeast.com,matt.wilstein@thedailybeast.com (Matt Wilstein),04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/jimmy-kimmel-mocks-donald-trump-jr-mueller-deemed-him-too-stupid-to-collude,"Jimmy Kimmel on Mueller Report: Only Don Jr. Could Be ‘Too Stupid to Collude’ The late-night host’s favorite part of the Mueller report concerned his old friend ‘DJTJ.’ Matt Wilstein 04.18.19 11:59 PM ET
“It was another remarkable day here in the United States,” Jimmy Kimmel told viewers at the top of his monologue Thursday night following the release of the Mueller report . Then he focused his ire on Attorney General William Barr.
“Before the report came out this morning, Trump’s defense attorney general William Barr held a very curious press conference, which was clearly designed to put a positive spin on this not very positive report,” the late-night host said. “This Bill Barr, I don’t know what his deal is. But he looks like if Elton John had conversion therapy and it worked.”
Noting that “many experts on the presidency were shocked by Bill Barr’s willingness to spin this thing in the president’s favor,” Kimmel said, “The attorney general is supposed to be independent, not an apologist for the White House.”
Later, Kimmel moved on to the “most explosive part” of the report, which revealed President Trump’s reaction to the appointment of the special counsel. Slumping in his chair, Trump reportedly said, “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I’m fucked.”
“And of course, he was wrong, it wasn’t the end of his presidency,” Kimmel replied. “And it’s us that are fucked.”
Trump also allegedly said, “This is the worst thing that ever happened to me,” to which the host shot back, “And I assume that includes Don Jr. being born.”
And speaking of Kimmel favorite Trump family target “DJTJ,” Kimmel highlighted the fact that Mueller’s team declined to indict the president’s eldest son because they could not determine that he “willfully violated the law.”
“In other words,” Kimmel said, “he was ruled too stupid to collude.” READ THIS LIST"

With Justin Bieber singing lyrics like “Hi, I’m a baboon, I’m like a man just less advanced and my anus is huge,” Lil Dicky’s musical collaboration on his new single, “Earth,” is sure to be a hit.
TMZ first reported the new animation and single release scheduled to drop next week. It’s Bieber’s first major collaboration since teaming up with DJ Khaled, Chance the Rapper, and Quavo last year for “No Brainer.”
The “What Do You Mean” singer joined a huge lineup of stars for new animation, including Ariana Grande as a zebra, Halsey as a lion club, and Wiz Khalifa as a skunk. Snoop Dogg also features as a talking marijuana plant that sings: “I’m a marijuana plant, I can get you fucked up.”
The song and animation star more than 30 A-listers: Adam Levine voices a group of vultures and Ed Sheeran is a koala. Sia, Katy Perry, Kevin Hart, and the Backstreet Boys all feature, and Leonardo DiCaprio appears as an animated version of himself.
Lil Dicky, the 31-year-old comedian-rapper, told Time that he wanted to use his contacts to force people to think more about climate change and how to fight back against it. “Right now, I don’t think people care that much. If everyone decided to care just a little bit—if everyone cared enough to not use straws at all—that’s going to have an impact,” he said.
“Somehow, life has led us to this 12-year-window where it’s on the people who are on earth right now to insist that everything finally gets actually taken seriously. What an opportunity.”
He added: “I wanted to minimally get people to even consider caring.” READ THIS LIST"
Northern Ireland Journalist Shot Dead in ‘Calculated’ Killing During Unrest,www.thedailybeast.com,Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau),04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/lyda-mckee-northern-ireland-journalist-targeted-for-her-work-covering-unrest,"SILENCED Northern Ireland Journalist Shot Dead in ‘Calculated’ Killing During Unrest Lyra McKee, 29, was shot in the head at the scene of Derry protest, in what police are calling a ‘terrorist incident’ as part of renewed violence. 04.19.19 6:14 AM ET Handout via Getty
Lyra McKee, a 29-year-old journalist in Northern Ireland, was fatally shot in the head late Thursday in the city of Derry , where riots had erupted and nationalist paramilitary forces tossed petrol bombs at law enforcement. Local police have said they believe she was fired upon by a dissident Republican group known as the New IRA, according to ITV News.
Violence has recently flared in the historically troubled city, where the Bloody Sunday massacre was carried out in 1972. Car bombs, stabbings, and gun violence have marked a spate of violence tied to the new militant group that has surged in recent weeks, along with fresh tensions related to Brexit and the prosecution of a British soldier for his role in the 1972 attack that left 14 unarmed civilians dead.
McKee is the fourth high-profile European female journalist killed in the last two years, after Sweden’s Kim Wall , Malta’s Daphne Caruana Galizia , and Bulgaria’s Victoria Marinova .
Her partner, Sara Canning, expressed her grief to reporters on Friday, saying her “death must not be in vain.”
“The senseless murder of Lyra McKee has left a family without a beloved daughter, a sister, an aunt, and a great aunt, has left so many friends without their confident, victims in the LGBTQIA community are left without a tireless advocate and activist, and it has left me without the love of my life, the woman I was planning to grow old with,” Canning said.
Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton confirmed McKee’s murder on Twitter late Thursday night. “Sadly I can confirm that following shots being fired tonight in Creggan, a 29-year-old woman has been killed. We are treating this as a terrorist incident and we have launched a murder enquiry.”
At a press conference Friday morning, Hamilton confirmed the line of investigation. “We believe this to be a terrorist act,” he said. “We believe it has been carried out by violent dissident republicans, our assessment at this time is that the New IRA are most likely to be the ones behind this and that forms our primary line of inquiry.”
Hamilton added, “But not only is it a murder of a young woman, it is an attack again on the people of this city. I stood here in January and we talked about the bomb and the act of violence against this city, and yet again we see another act of violence in this city which has had horrendous consequences and which will affect people for many, many years.
“The bringing of a firearm out and firing it down a street in a residential area where they knew lots of people were standing about is a calculated and callous act and can only be designed to hurt and kill people.”
The official appealed for calm ahead of Easter weekend. “I would appeal to people who are intent on violence to draw back, I would appeal to people with influence to use your influence and make sure this is peaceful weekend. Not only this weekend but going forward in this city.”
Police officials said later Friday that McKee was standing near officers when she was hit. More than one suspect was reportedly being sought in the shooting.
McKee tweeted from the streets shortly before she was fatally shot. “Derry tonight,” she wrote over a photo of smoke rising and anti-bomb vehicles in front of her. “Absolute madness.”
British Prime Minister Theresa May condemned the murder on Twitter early Friday. “The death of Lyra McKee in last night’s suspected terrorist incident in Londonderry is shocking and truly senseless,” she tweeted from the official Downing Street account . “My deepest condolences go to her family, friends and colleagues. She was a journalist who died doing her job with great courage.”
McKee’s fellow journalist Leona O’Neill wrote on Twitter that she had witnessed the murder. “I was standing beside this young woman when she fell beside a police Land Rover tonight in Creggan,” O’Neill tweeted. “I called an ambulance for her, but police put her in the back of their vehicle and rushed her to hospital where she died. Just 29 years old. Sick to my stomach tonight.”
Rev. Joe Gormley, a Catholic priest based in the Creggan area who knew McKee personally, told the Belfast Telegraph that he had been at the hospital to give her last rites. “It’s just dreadful to see Lyra’s partner and family heartbroken this morning,” he said. “Last night I was called over to the hospital and they just thought it was someone else, they thought it had to be somebody else, that it wasn’t Lyra, but unfortunately it was.”
McKee was an accomplished investigative journalist who had just signed a two-book publishing deal with Faber & Faber. Her work dissecting the complicated political situation in Northern Ireland appeared in The Atlantic , Mosaic Science, and BuzzFeed.
She was named by Forbes in 2016 as one of the top “30 Under 30 in Media.” At a TED talk in 2017, she talked about tolerance, the targeting of gay people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, and the struggles she has faced.
Her “Letter to My 14-Year-Old Self” about growing up gay in Belfast was made into a short film in 2019. In it, she lamented over a local pastor saying two lesbians living together did not make a family. She poignantly wrote, “Life is so hard right now. Every day, you wake up wondering who else will find out your secret and hate you. It won’t always be like this. It’s going to get better.”
Her partner said Friday that “we are all poor for the loss of Lyra.”
“Our hopes and dreams and all of her amazing potential was snuffed out by a single barbaric act. This cannot stand,” Canning said. “Her legacy will live on in the light that she has left behind.” READ THIS LIST"
Inside Stacks House: The Terrible ‘Feminist’ Money Pop-Up Invading Los Angeles,www.thedailybeast.com,Tarpley.Hitt@thedailybeast.com (Tarpley Hitt),04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-stacks-house-the-terrible-feminist-money-pop-up-invading-los-angeles,"Inside Stacks House: The Terrible ‘Feminist’ Money Pop-Up Invading Los Angeles Courtesy of Stacks House ‘We want women to know being rich is OK,’ a spokeswoman said, standing by a shower of dollar bills. Tarpley Hitt 04.19.19 4:50 AM ET
L OS ANGELES—Tuesday afternoon, a handful of reporters trickled into a neon warehouse in Los Angeles’ Arts District, graffitied with the phrase: “You’re So Money.” This particular building isn’t a store—it’s an event space that reinvents itself semi-regularly for a string of transient pop-up exhibits. Last October, it was Cheat Day , a fantasia of pastry dumbbells and food art dedicated to “the snacks and treats that we dream of during our workouts.” Before that, it was the millennial pink, Wonka-wannabe Museum of Ice Cream . Now, the building has been taken over by Stacks House , an 11,000-square-foot temporary museum, which its founders call a “proudly for-profit feminist financial business concept.” Like its predecessors, Stacks House is a maze of colorful installations—only instead of ice cream, the theme is money, investment and debt.
Stacks House is the invention of “Experiential Marketing Maven” Patience Ramsey, former Hillary Clinton fundraiser Kindra Meyer, and personal finance influencer Farnoosh Torabi. In the past, pop-up museums have drawn criticism as costly, hollow spectacles for the social-media age— The New York Times ’ internet critic Amanda Hess called her journey through several of these things “a masochistic march through voids of meaning.” Stacks House posits itself as a remedy to that—the founders call it a “pop-up with purpose.” That purpose, the website says, is to promote financial independence and help close the gap between women and wealth in America. “We want women to know being rich is OK,” publicist Jenny Gorenstein said during the press tour, standing by a shower of dollar bills.
But in a political moment defined by fury over inequality, with cavernous gaps between the incomes of managerial rich and the working poor; health care costs so high that GoFundMe fundraisers have become a virtual extension of the insurance infrastructure; and more than 44 million borrowers who collectively owe a staggering $1.5 trillion in student loan debt, Stacks House gives off the impression of missing something—if not, perhaps, everything. (As if to prove a point: the installation recently scored an endorsement from Goop ).
Stacks House interprets its purpose with whimsy. A quick jaunt through the exhibit will take attendees through the Debt Boxing Gym, where women can pose in a bright orange ring bearing the word BO$$, or hit punching bags with statistics on student loans, “deadbeat friends” and credit card debt. From there, visitors can dry off on money-printed towels, take a ride on a mechanical piggy bank at the Retirement Rodeo, or hit the Stacks Salon—a mock-beauty shop offering tips on how to map out your next side hustle. “The only way we can affect change is through money,” founder Patience Ramsey told The Daily Beast. “Money is power, and we have to figure out how to have a lot of money to affect change.”
In a sense, there’s something radically transparent about Stacks House. Pop-up shops have always been concerned with shoring up capital of some form or another. Historians of pop-up retail—which do exist—have traced the concept back as far as 19th-century traveling merchants, which were central during the Industrial Revolution for establishing markets in hard-to-reach areas. But the idea really owes its origin to a man named Joe Marver, who, in 1983, opened the first Spirit Halloween Superstore—patient zero of the pop-up trend. Marver noticed that by setting up temporary locations during the Halloween season, he could multiply his profits. These days, according to the Business of Fashion , the company’s 1,200 short-lived storefronts generate 50% of its annual revenue.
At that point, Marver wasn’t calling his invention a pop-up—the word didn’t come around until the early aughts, according to Trendwatching.com. In an article dated January 2004, the fad site claimed to have coined the phrase “pop-up retail,” as a catch-all for a marketing trend capitalizing on what they called “planned spontaneity.” Even then, the word was all about money. In one of the early self-declared “pop-ups,” a Teen Vogue installation called the Haute Spot set up at a mall in New Jersey. “Our goal is to encourage people to shop in the mall,” a spokesperson told The New York Times . Stacks House has taken the concept to its most literal end. (In interviews with The Daily Beast, representatives consistently called their clientele “consumers.”) “ For all its honestly, there is something sinister about the exhibit. ”
For all its honestly, there is something sinister about the exhibit. Stacks House pitches itself as an educational experience to promote financial literacy. But information is scarce in the exhibits, swapped out for scripted mantras like “Let’s get that bread.” The main data comes from interactive beacons placed in each installation, and even those have their limits. The beacon in the boxing gym, for example, offers a list of different types of debt, and asks users to select all that apply to them. But each option leads to the same page, with generic advice about prioritizing the highest interest loans first, automating payments, and seeking help at non-profits. Another beacon quizzes users on their investment knowledge—but doesn’t provide answers to the questions they got wrong. In a phone call with The Daily Beast, founder Farnoosh Torabi offered an alternative vision of these beacons—less as a means of supplying data and more as a means of collecting it.
“The pop-up is going to tour,” she said, “and in each city where we invite women to come, we’re going to be learning about what their financial challenges are, what their financial health is, where their credit is, what kind of student loan debt they have, where are they in terms of investing, what are their biggest needs.” (Stacks House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether it will ask attendees for consent on data collection).
But the most unsettling aspect of the installation is that it leaves visitors with the impression that financial solvency is something they can control. There’s a Manifestation Mural, where visitors can visualize their financial dreams on the wall and “manifest” them into existence. The Money Moves section recommends requesting money in lieu of presents. And in the Retirement Rodeo, a wall of piggy banks offers tips on saving, with advice like “Coupons,” “Fewer Green Juices,” and “Quit Vice.” (This section was sponsored by Charles Schwab, which last year paid the SEC $2.8 million in settlement money, over allegations that they failed to report suspicious activity from investment advisors.)
The result is an exhibit full of incremental adjustments for individuals, without information on how money operates in a larger context. Stacks House doesn’t address the reasons people fall into debt or the systemic inequalities that have kept certain groups from accumulating wealth. It doesn’t mention government bodies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—which recently scrapped an Obama-era regulation on payday lenders, requiring them to assess whether borrowers can pay back their loans before issuing them—or discuss skyrocketing healthcare costs, which can often deter people from seeking care. Instead, it propagates the myth that elbow grease alone might stave off catastrophe.
For their part, the founders say that Stacks House is just the first step in what will be a long project. When asked about addressing deceptive financial institutions, income inequality, and other larger systemic questions, Gorenstein said: “These are definitely the kinds of questions we want so we can get deeper and more nuanced with how we’re dispensing advice for the go-forward.” Stacks House also plans to host seminars in an adjacent event space to talk about important issues like debt management.
In a recent Forbes piece promoting Stacks House, writer Megan Gorman opens with an anecdote about an infamous, ‘60s-era advertising campaign. The ad features a young woman dressed as a superhero, touting the slogan “You’ve Come a Long Way, Baby.” It was capitalizing on the feminist wave of a Boomer Generation reeling from the revelation of women’s liberation. What was it selling? Cigarettes. The Virginia Slim “ultra-smooth” ad would go down in history as one of the most successful, if profoundly cynical, marketing campaigns of the century. It was also, perhaps inadvertently, an apt allegory for Stacks House: colorful, empowering packaging for a product that could, quite probably, be harmful."
Measles Crisis: Judge Dismisses Parents’ Suit Against NYC,www.thedailybeast.com,Jaclyn Jeffrey-Wilensky,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/measles-crisis-judge-dismisses-parents-suit-against-nyc,"‘THE FIRE OF CONTAGION’ Measles Crisis: Judge Dismisses Parents’ Suit Against NYC The parents wanted the court to reverse an emergency order requiring vaccination during a measles outbreak. 04.19.19 4:48 AM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Getty
A New York judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit brought against the city’s Department of Health by five parents who refuse to vaccinate their children.
The dismissal shores up an emergency order declaring the city’s measles outbreak a public health emergency. In addition to mandating the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine for children in zip codes affected by the crisis, it threatened parents with fines of up to $1,000.
There have been 329 confirmed cases of the viral illness, mostly among observant Jews in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn.
“The unvarnished truth is that these diagnoses represent the most significant spike in incidences of measles in the United States in many years and that the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn is at its epicenter,” Kings County Supreme Court justice Lawrence Knipel wrote.
Knipel debunked the parents’ arguments, concluding that their medical objections to vaccines ran counter to scientific evidence; their religious objections weren’t supported by doctrine, and were only relevant to school admissions; and their moral objections, such as their insistence on informed consent for vaccines, were misplaced.
“A fireman need not obtain the informed consent of the owner before extinguishing a house fire,” he wrote. “Vaccination is known to extinguish the fire of contagion.”
Jay Begun, founder of Kindercare Pediatrics in Williamsburg and an instructor in the Department of Pediatrics at Mount Sinai, said the dismissal was a victory for the community.
“Now more people will be encouraged to immunize their children, and it will create a safer environment for everyone,” he said. “This proves that the greater good trumps the marginal opinions of a small segment of the population.”
But, he added, when it comes to enforcing the order, “the less punitive the better and the more educational the better.”
One Hasidic father, who asked that his name not be shared in order to protect his privacy, felt that the dismissal was a step toward safety for his community.
“It is still scary to go out with the kids in Williamsburg, but hopefully this will help turn around the situation,” he said.
Robert Krakow, the parents’ attorney and a frequent representative of parents who claim their children were injured by vaccines, said he wasn’t particularly surprised by the judge’s decision.
Krakow claimed that a new version of the order presented during the hearing said the city could fine parents per day, as opposed to only once, for refusing to vaccinate their children.
“Wouldn’t you expect, when the city handed over the order and said the criminal provisions are removed, that they would also highlight any significant changes?” he said. “I didn’t hear them say anything about fines per day. Let’s just say we’re investigating it.”
The decision came on the same day that the Health Department announced it had issued summonses to three parents for not vaccinating their children . The department also shut down four yeshivas for not complying with its order that unvaccinated students be forbidden from attending. A daycare that was shut down earlier this week , United Talmudical Academy, reopened today under close supervision by the Health Department. READ THIS LIST"
"Meet Map Pesqueira, The First Trans Person Prevented From Joining The Military By Trump’s Ban",www.thedailybeast.com,samantha.allen@thedailybeast.com (Samantha Allen),04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/meet-map-pesqueira-the-first-trans-person-prevented-from-joining-the-military-by-trumps-ban,"DISCRIMINATION Meet Map Pesqueira, The First Trans Person Prevented From Joining The Military By Trump’s Ban Trump’s ban is officially underway: Map Pesqueira, a University of Texas at Austin freshman, tells The Daily Beast he lost his military scholarship because he is a transgender man. Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway / The Daily Beast / GoFundMe
Try telling Map Pesqueira that the transgender troop ban is not a ban.
The University of Texas at Austin freshman revealed this week that he had lost his military scholarship because he is a transgender man, as The Daily Texan first reported . His is the first known case of a person losing such a scholarship due to the Trump administration’s policy on transgender service , which went into effect on April 12.
“It’s awful,” Pesqueira told The Daily Beast. “I’m so hurt by it.”
Now, instead of looking forward to an all-but-guaranteed military career, Pesqueira has had to turn to crowdfunding, raising money through GoFundMe to stay at UT Austin now that his scholarship money is gone. As of this writing, the 19-year-old has raised $17,000 from over 400 donors to keep paying out of pocket for school.
If he can’t get tuition money together, he will have to reassess his options.
“I had a career and a job lined up after college and I would be taken care of—and now that’s not happening anymore,” he told The Daily Beast. “Right now, I’m looking at having to go back home to San Antonio and go to community college until I’m able to figure out what my next step is.”
Pesqueira is 19 years old. He started transitioning last February, legally changing his name and gender marker in May. Last year, the transgender troop ban was still blocked by a handful of federal injunctions , so Pesqueira’s path to service was clear.
When the Supreme Court decided in January 2019 to allow the Department of Defense to implement the Trump administration’s ban, Pesqueira says he didn’t get any updates about the status of his scholarship.
He started sending “multiple emails,” he told The Daily Beast, “asking for an update.”
Then, on March 19 this year, he underwent top surgery to masculinize his chest.
Finally, on March 24, he emailed his adviser at the Department of Defense—and got a response. But he couldn’t bear to read it right away.
“I didn’t really take a look at that email until around the beginning of April,” he recalled, “Because I had just had surgery and I wasn’t really in a clear mind to comprehend everything—and when I did read the email, I learned that I would be disqualified.”
The Trump administration’s policy on transgender military service bars people who have undergone transition-related medical care from enlisting, and only allows a tiny subset of transgender people to serve in the military without suppressing their identity, namely those who received a gender dysphoria diagnosis before April 12 .
Someone like Pesqueira, who had not only been diagnosed with gender dysphoria but been treated for it, will have no way to enlist under the ban.
On April 8, as the freshman told The Daily Beast, he received final confirmation from his adviser that he would be disqualified: “He said, ‘It’s been an honor and privilege working with you,’ and that was that,” Pesqueira said.
Just like that, his goal was out of reach. “Map Pesqueira is the first, but sadly won’t be the last. Map is qualified, capable, and willing to serve. The only reason he can’t is a discriminatory policy that costs this nation our future heroes”
Organizations that serve LGBT service members hope that Pesqueira’s story can draw attention to the human toll of the transgender troop ban.
“The trans ban is already costing careers,” SPART*A president Lieutenant Commander Blake Dremann told The Daily Beast in a statement. “Map Pesqueira is the first, but sadly won’t be the last. Map is qualified, capable, and willing to serve. The only reason he can’t is a discriminatory policy that costs this nation our future heroes.”
Andy Blevins, executive director at OutServe-SLDN, which sued the Trump administration over the ban, told The Daily Beast in a statement that Map’s “selection for a coveted ROTC scholarship” only underscores his qualifications to serve.
“Map lost his scholarship and future career—and this country lost his leadership and dedication to the mission—because of a discriminatory and unwarranted ban that was founded in mistruths and ignorant biases,” he added. “We can, and we must, do better.”
Pesqueira wanted to serve so badly that he initially wished he had suppressed his gender identity to do so. (“Why did I start transitioning?” he asked himself, as he told The Daily Beast. “I should have thought about it and put my transition on hold to make sure that I would be able to go into the military and serve my country.”)
The transgender troop ban tacitly encourages this sort of thinking , by making gender dysphoria a disqualifying condition “unless applicants have lived in birth gender for three years immediately prior,” as the Palm Center think tank notes in its breakdown of the policy.
In other words, if Pesqueira knew the details of the policy in advance of seeking medical treatment, he might have delayed his transition—which can have extremely deleterious effects on mental health—in order to start his career.
Those conflicted feelings came to a climax after the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the transgender troop ban could go into effect.
“I started thinking that this is my fault,” he told The Daily Beast. “This is my fault that I’m like this. I don’t want to be like this. If I were just cisgender, I wouldn’t have to deal with this—and why couldn’t I have been born like that? Why did I have to be born trans?”
He hit rock bottom shortly thereafter. “It really got to me and it was hard to find something to cling onto that kept me positive,” he said.
Only with the help of loved ones has he been able to return to a place of love and self-acceptance. They have reassured him that being transgender is not a choice, that he is who he is, and that he can’t suppress his identity to please the ill-informed.
“The positivity really came from the support of my friends and my family and the people who are sending me encouraging messages,” Pesqueira said. “So that’s where my strength and positivity and light is coming from in all of this.” “I’ll be an older lieutenant, an older officer, but it will still be what I dreamed of doing, I’ll just be a little bit older”
The college freshman still plans to pursue a military career if and when the ban gets reversed. But because he hopes to become an officer, there are timing issues to consider. Many service members become officers by commissioning through their undergraduate degree, so if Pesqueira can’t do that, he will have to go to graduate school and commission that way instead—presuming the policy has been lifted by then.
“I’ll be an older lieutenant, an older officer, but it will still be what I dreamed of doing, I’ll just be a little bit older,” he said.
Even then, he’s trying to shield himself from the possibility that the ban could remain in effect for longer than he can afford to wait. “I would just have to accept it and figure out something else [if that happened], which is what I’m trying to do right now.”
A Department of Defense spokesperson told The Daily Beast: “The student’s gender identity did not impact his status in the ROTC program. The scholarship offer was contingent upon meeting the standards required of all prospective recruits; the student did not meet these standards.”
As a point of clarification, The Daily Beast asked the DoD whether Pesqueira having received transition-related medical care is what impacted his ROTC status.
The DoD spokesperson said: “The offer was contingent upon meeting service entry standards. There are a wide range of medical conditions that make prospective recruits unfit for military service. It would be improper to discuss the medical history of a particular candidate.”
Pesqueira has been blown away by the support he has received on GoFundMe . He was anticipating “a couple of donations from my family and friends” but now, it has been spread nationally. He calls the donations “very, very humbling.”
He knows that there are others in a similar position who have yet to come forward—“I’m not the only one going through this,” he told The Daily Beast—and he wants to shine a light on their situation.
“I am doing this to bring justice,” he said. “It’s what needs to be done. It’s the right thing to do.” READ THIS LIST"
Robert Mueller Made One Mistake: He Trusted Bill Barr,www.thedailybeast.com,michael.daly@thedailybeast.com (Michael Daly),04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/mueller-made-one-mistake-he-trusted-bill-barr,"opinion Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty
Two days before the 50th anniversary of Robert Mueller being seriously wounded while leading his platoon against a numerically superior enemy in Vietnam , his latest service to the nation was released in the form of the Special Counsel’s Report .
In a morning press conference before the release, Attorney General William Barr seemed to give a friend of three decades his due after two years of lies and slander by our president.
“I would also like to thank Special Counsel Mueller for his service and the thoroughness of his investigation, particularly his work exposing the nature of Russia’s attempts to interfere in our electoral process,” Barr said.
A few breaths later, Barr committed one of the great public betrayals of our history.
The country’s most senior law enforcement officer actually sought to justify President Trump’s mendacious attacks against Mueller and the investigation he had been appointed to conduct.
“As the special counsel’s report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks,” Barr said.
In fact, the report acknowledges no such thing.
What the report does demonstrate is that Mueller conducted an exceedingly fair, determinedly thorough investigation.
Just as he had on the battlefield a half century ago, Mueller performed brilliantly.
His one mistake was to trust his supposed friend Barr.
To call Barr a human hedgehog would be unfair if the resemblance were confined to his appearance. But he also shares a hedgehog’s unique “self-anointing,” a behavior that involves licking an object whose smell the creature finds attractive until it works up a froth that it then rubs on itself.
Barr must have worked up considerable froth in the presence of the president. He smelled like pure Trump on March 24, when he offered a four-page document that was was supposed to be an honest appraisal of the evidence Mueller so carefully gathered under such trying circumstances.
Barr reeked of The Donald when he subsequently spoke of the FBI “spying” on the Trump campaign.
During his public betrayal of Mueller at Thursday’s press conference, Barr twice said there was “no collusion.” He implicitly excused even Trump’s demonstrable lies concerning an effort to fire Mueller because of fictitious “conflicts.”
As he exonerated Trump, Barr failed to note that page two of Volume II of the very document he was releasing states, “While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”
The report further states, “If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.”
Mueller apparently did not foresee that Barr would effectively see Trump exonerated anyway. Mueller also did not likely anticipate that when releasing the report, Barr would say Trump’s behavior must be put “in context” and accepted.
The report documents that Trump lied, lied, and lied again—and pressured his subordinates to do the same.
The true source of the frustration and anger that Barr describes was partly the refusal of several staffers to be as unprincipled as their president.
The most prominent of those who stood up to the president was White House Counsel Don McGahn, nephew of the late Atlantic City lawyer/fixer Paddy McGahn. The uncle cleared the way for Trump’s casinos and the nephew might therefore have been expected to be situationally flexible. But the uncle was also a thrice-wounded Marine and recipient of the Navy Cross. The report describes the nephew as responding more like a Marine than a fixer/lawyer.
The big test for Don McGahn came after Trump instructed him to have Mueller fired for supposed “conflicts,” in June 2017. Mueller would subsequently find himself in the bizarre position of investigating an attempt to stop him from investigating.
“The president cited as conflicts that Mueller had interviewed for the FBI Director position shortly before being appointed as special counsel, that he had worked for a law firm that represented people affiliated with the president, and that Mueller had disputed certain fees relating to his membership in a Trump golf course in Northern Virginia,” the report notes.
The report adds that Steve Bannon told Trump the purported conflicts were “ridiculous.” Mueller had never been interviewed for the FBI Director. He had not represented any Trump people, even if others at his very large law firm had.
As for the supposed golf course fee dispute, the report says:
“In October 2011, Mueller resigned his family’s membership from Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, in a letter that noted that, ‘We live in the District and find that we are unable to make full use of the Club,’ and that inquired ‘whether we would be entitled to a refund of a portion of our initial membership fee,’ which was paid in 1994.”
The report adds, “About two weeks later , the controller of the club responded that the Muellers’ resignation would be effective Oct. 31, 2011, and that they would be ‘placed on a waitlist to be refunded on a first resigned / first refunded basis...’ The Muellers have not had further contact with the club.”
McGahn said he would quit rather than fire Mueller on fictitious grounds, and went so far as to pack up his office. Trump relented, and that might have been that, had the “fake news” not reported the truth.
“In early 2018, the press reported that the president had directed McGahn to have the special counsel removed in June 2017 and that McGahn had threatened to resign rather than carry out the order,” the report says. “The president reacted to the news stories by directing White House officials to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed. McGahn told those officials that the media reports were accurate in stating that the president had directed McGahn to have the special counsel removed. The president then met with McGahn in the Oval Office and again pressured him to deny the reports.”
The report continues, “The president asked McGahn whether he would ‘do a correction,’ and McGahn said no.
“The president also asked McGahn in the meeting why he had told Special Counsel’s Office investigators that the president had told him to have the special counsel removed. McGahn responded that he had to, and that his conversations with the president were not protected by attorney-client privilege.”
Trump inquired about McGahn’s habit of jotting down what was said during meetings with him. The report says, “The president then asked, ‘What about these notes? Why do you take notes? Lawyers don't take notes. I never had a lawyer who took notes.’ McGahn responded that he keeps notes because he is a ‘real lawyer’ and explained that notes create a record and are not a bad thing. The president said, ‘I’ve had a lot of great lawyers, like Roy Cohn. He did not take notes.’”
Anybody who was around Roy Cohn knew that he did not want to be hampered by a record and that he always sought to make the truth whatever best suited him at the moment. And Cohn was not just Trump’s lawyer; he was young Donald’s mentor.
To read the litany of Trump’s lies as detailed in the Mueller report is to feel that Cohn’s spirit has risen from the crypt in Queens that he shares with his mother. Trump also lies about the successful firing of FBI Director James Comey.
Then there are the lies about the Mueller investigation itself. The report describes a moment on the south lawn last August: “In an impromptu exchange with reporters that lasted approximately five minutes, the president twice called the special counsel’s investigation a ‘rigged witch hunt.’”
So said the president who sought to rig the firing of a resolutely honest prosecutor.
At another moment, the report says, “The president described the special counsel’s investigation as ‘a witch hunt that ends in disgrace.’”
The actual disgrace belongs to Trump and to Barr.
In assuming the scent of the president, the human hedgehog seems to have also assumed the scent of Trump’s mentor. Cohn spoke endlessly about loyalty, but was always ready to betray a friend.
In Barr’s case, that is Mueller, whose only big mistake in the investigation was trusting him.
It’s nearly 50 years since Mueller led his platoon from potential disaster, despite a bullet wound to the thigh. This is one of the qualities that has long made America great. Barr, and Trump, and his truth-indifferent supporters, all owe Mueller an apology READ THIS LIST"
Kenya Banned Her Film for Its ‘Corrupt’ Lesbian Romance. So She Showed It Off to the World.,www.thedailybeast.com,Joseph.Longo@thedailybeast.com (Joseph Longo),04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/rafiki-kenya-banned-her-film-for-its-corrupt-lesbian-romance-so-she-showed-it-off-to-the-world,"RULE BREAKER Kenya Banned Her Film for Its ‘Corrupt’ Lesbian Romance. So She Showed It Off to the World. Director Wanuri Kahiu’s joyous lesbian romance ‘Rafiki’ was banned in her home country of Kenya. So she sued the government—and showed it off to the world. 04.19.19 3:14 AM ET via RafikiMovie.com
Cate Blanchett found Rafiki “incredibly powerful and moving,” while Benicio Del Toro went out of his way to chat with star Samantha Mugatsia. Dr. Ezekiel Mutua of the Kenya Film Classification Board, on the other hand, said the film works “to corrupt our culture and moral values, and to kill the institution of family.”
Rafiki , based on the Ugandan short story “Jambula Tree” by Monica Arac de Nyeko, follows a Kenyan Romeo and Juliet romance between the daughters of rival politicians. Kena (Mugatsia) and Ziki (Sheila Munyiva) explore first-time love in a country where being gay is illegal. Doused with saturated colors and tender performances, Rafiki is a rarity in queer cinema with a bright and hopeful tone.
That’s exactly what Mutua detested. It wasn’t that Rafiki depicted a lesbian romance—intimate kissing was in the script he’d approved. Rather, it was that the film depicted a positive love story. As chair of the Kenya Film Classification board, he banned the film last April for “clear intent to promote lesbianism in Kenya contrary to the law.” Homosexuality is punishable up to 14 years in prison in the East African country. ( Advocates are currently in court hoping to strike down the pre-colonial law ).
Before banning the film, Mutua offered director Wanuri Kahiu an out: change the film’s ending. “I remember it very clearly,” she recalls. Kahiu alleges they told her the ending “is not remorseful enough, and it makes it seem as if LGBT people can be accepted in Kenya.” Mutua and the Kenya Film Classification board did not return The Daily Beast’s multiple requests for comment.
Kahiu chose not to alter her ending, refuting their claim that she changed the script they had approved months earlier. Knowing Rafiki would prove controversial, she worked with a lawyer throughout production in case the classification board squashed the film.
Mutua did just that on April 17, 2018, issuing an official nationwide ban on Rafiki . “We wish to emphasize the fact that films made in Kenya for public consumption MUST reflect and respect the dominant values of the Kenyan society,” he said in a statement. Notably, the ban does not extend to foreign films. The 2019 Indian lesbian rom-com Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga is currently playing in theaters across Kenya.
“It’s not about the representation of LGBT issues from around the world,” Kahiu says of the ban. “The concern is us seeing ourselves in a particular way.”
While the classification board balked, a major foreign film festival readily took Rafiki under its wing. In May 2018, Rafiki became the first Kenyan film to play at the Cannes Film Festival. Main competition jury members Cate Blanchett, Ava DuVernay, Lea Seydoux and Khadja Nin skipped out on official duties to see the film, which was nominated in a lesser category. Nin, a Burundian musician, encouraged film journalists to “follow up on the situation once [the stars] return home.”
Indeed once home from Cannes, Kahiu filed a constitutional petition to remove the ban to meet the seven-day screening requirement for Oscar consideration in the Best Foreign Language Film category. High court judge Wilfrida Okwany consented . Kahiu just barely scraped by— Rafiki ’s last day of screening to a sold-out audience in Nairobi was the final day for Oscar eligibility.
Trevor Noah joked about the ruling on The Daily Show . “I think it’s amazing that homophobia bows down to the Academy Awards.” However, Rafiki was not chosen as Kenya’s Oscar entry. Supa Modo , about a terminally ill young girl dreaming of being a superhero, was selected but did not receive a nomination. Mutua blamed Rafiki ’s failed nomination on Kahiu’s refusal to change the ending. “I can bet it would have qualified for nomination to the Oscars and would have won an award. See now!” he tweeted .
The controversy proved helpful for distribution. Rafiki dominated the 2018-2019 film festival circuit, with high-profile screenings at the Toronto and Palm Springs fests. That’s Kahiu’s silver-lining. “You dream about your film getting international releases,” she said. “It’s amazing to go around the world with it and see how different people are responding to the film.” “It’s not about the representation of LGBT issues from around the world. The concern is us seeing ourselves in a particular way.”
Over a year after its world premiere at Cannes, Rafiki finally premiered in select North American theaters Friday. “We saw this as a real talent. We felt the film was important not just because it was a good film but also because of where the film’s coming from and what it’s trying to accomplish in its home country,” said Michael Rosenberg, president of Film Movement, the distributor of the film in North America.
Kahiu is grateful Rafiki ’s notoriety is shining an international light on Kenya’s anti-LGBT laws. But she didn’t create the film for American liberals. “The people who need to see themselves hopeful and joyful are not able to see the film,” she said, noting LGBT Kenyans face high risks of assault.
Rafiki is in many ways a success story for African filmmaking after achieving international acclaim and distribution. Kahiu, and occasionally her two leads, have appeared in glossy photo shoots for Vanity Fair and Vogue . The Guardian reported that Kahiu became the first African woman to receive a studio dea l when Universal and Reese Witherspoon’s production company Hello Sunshine tapped her to direct the adaption of The Thing About Jellyfish starring Stranger Things ’ Millie Bobby Brown. She’s also working on a Los Angeles-set musical romance for Universal, as well as with Viola Davis’ production company on Wild Sees , an Amazon sci-fi show .
But Kahiu isn’t able to revel in her rising star. Per Kenya’s ban, she purged her computer and home of all Rafiki production and promotion materials. “I don’t have a copy of my own film,” she says, with a resigned laugh. “More than anything, I would love to be able to collect the posters from around the world just as a token of this time.”
Then there are the legal battles still waging around the film. Kahiu is suing the Kenyan government for infringing her constitutional right to freedom of expression. The Guardian also reports she’ll appear in court in June. If she wins, the historic ruling would lift the ban on most previously banned films, including Rafiki and fellow LGBT narrative Stories of Our Lives .
“We wouldn’t feel so firm about it if our constitution didn’t allow us the right to freedom of expression in the very way that it is written,” Kahiu says of all Kenyan films. “Everybody has the right to watch them. They have the right to choose to watch them.”"
"Matt Gaetz Hires Dr. Darren Beattie, Speechwriter Fired From White House Over White Nationalist Conference",www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/matt-gaetz-hires-dr-darren-beattie-speechwriter-fired-from-white-house-over-white-nationalist-conference,"04.19.19 12:13 PM ET Zach Gibson
One of President Donald Trump’s top congressional allies announced on Friday that he’d hired a speechwriter who left the White House last year after it was reported he’d spoken at a conference attended by white nationalists.
Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) tweeted that he had brought on board “the talented Dr. Darren Beattie” to serve as a “Special Advisor for Speechwriting.”
Beattie, who has a PhD in political theory from Duke University, was an outspoken Trump supporter at Duke and wrote op-eds backing Trump’s candidacy and his policy positions. He later joined the administration as a full-time speechwriter and policy aide.
That administration job became imperiled after CNN’s KFILE investigative unit reported in summer 2018 that Beattie had spoken at a 2016 conference frequented by white nationalists like Richard Spencer, who also was a PhD student at Duke University. Beattie, who delivered a talk called “The Intelligentsia and the Right,” was on the program alongside Peter Brimelow, founder of the anti-immigrant website VDARE, and other alt-right figures.
According to The Washington Post , the White House in August asked Beattie to resign over his attendance at the conference. When he refused to do so, he was fired.
In a text to The Daily Beast, Gaetz said he had no issues with Beattie’s attendance at the conference, noting that Beattie had not been accused of saying anything bad himself but merely being in attendance while “other people said bad stuff.”
“I remember when the left tried this on America’s now most popular Governor,” Gaetz added, adding a link to a 2018 campaign story of how then-Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) attended the far-right Freedom Center conference four times. DeSantis went on to win the election despite being dogged for his attendance at that event.
It is unusual for House members, save for those in leadership, to have designated speechwriters. Told that The Daily Beast assumed he wrote his own speeches, Gaetz responded with the “HAHA” function on iMessage.
This is not Gaetz’s first flirtation with figures from the world of the alt-right. In 2018, the Florida congressman invited Chuck Johnson, a notorious right-wing troll, to be his guest to the State of the Union. Gaetz told Politico that he was unaware of most of Johnson’s views before extending the invite.
Shortly after Beattie was fired from the White House, Johnson came to his defense in an email chain for the listserv of the conservative Claremont Institute, which quickly spiraled into finger-pointing about white nationalism .
In response to an August 21 email from Beattie defending his reputation, Johnson replied “well said” and fended off criticism from other listserv members about Beattie’s associations.
“Beattie's offense is that he spoke at an event where -- gasp! -- there were white nationalists afoot!” wrote Johnson. “Heaven forbid that some thinkers -- like the American founders who favored our country be majority white -- think that the U.S. of A should stay majority white.” READ THIS LIST"

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Friday became the first 2020 presidential candidate to explicitly say Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump, citing Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s findings.
“The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help,” Warren tweeted on Friday afternoon. “Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack.”
She then cited text from the special counsel’s redacted report, released Thursday: “Congress has authority to prohibit a President’s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.”
“The correct process for exercising that authority is impeachment,” the senator declared.
“The severity of [Trump’s] misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty,” the Massachusetts Democrat concluded. “That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States.”
Most recently, Warren said she wanted to wait until the Mueller report was released before making a conclusion on impeachment—a line that many 2020 Democrats have taken thus far. Now she is one of two who definitively said that the contents of the report warrant the initiation of impeachment proceedings.
Other competitors in the primary field have been more cautious in recent days deferring to Congress on the matter, though in an interview with CNN on Friday, Julián Castro was more direct saying that it would be ""perfectly reasonable"" for the House to begin impeachment proceedings. Castro's campaign characterized it as him being first to the punch on the issue.
“I think that Congress needs to make that decision,” South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg said at an event on Friday. “I think he may well deserve it, but my focus, since I’m not a part of Congress but I am part of 2020, is to give him a decisive defeat at the ballot box, if he is the Republican nominee in 2020.”
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) told MSNBC that she wouldn’t rule it out but would like to hear testimony from Mueller.
“I think that there is definitely a conversation to be had on that subject, but first I want to hear from Bob Mueller,” Harris told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes in an interview on Thursday, “and really understand what exactly is the evidence that supports the summary that we have been given today.”
Others, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), have only said that Congress should continue investigating the president.
“It is clear that Donald Trump wanted nothing more than to shut down the Mueller investigation,” he said on Thursday following the report’s release. “While we have more detail from today’s report than before, Congress must continue its investigation into Trump’s conduct and any foreign attempts to influence our election. We must also work to do everything we can to protect our future elections from the significant threat of foreign interference, and I call on President Trump and Republican leadership to stop obstructing the necessary work to protect our democracy.”"
Seagram’s Heiress Clare Bronfman Pleads Guilty in NXIVM Sex-Cult Case,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/seagrams-heiress-clare-bronfman-bookkeeper-kathy-russell-to-plead-guilty-in-nxivm-sex-cult-case,"Seagram’s Heiress Clare Bronfman Pleads Guilty in NXIVM Sex-Cult Case NXIVM founder Keith Raniere may be the only person in the case to stand trial. 04.19.19 4:58 PM ET REUTERS/Brendan McDermid
Seagram’s heiress Clare Bronfman pleaded guilty on Friday afternoon for her role in NXIVM, a purported cult in which women were allegedly branded and groomed for sex with the group’s leader.
Bronfman , 40, who was once NXIVM’s operations director and one of its largest donors, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to conceal and harbor illegal aliens for financial gain and fraudulent use of identification.
The group’s bookkeeper Kathy Russell, 62, also pleaded guilty Friday to one count of racketeering conspiracy before U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn federal court. Russell later pleaded guilty to one count of visa fraud, and is expected to be sentenced in late July. She faces up to 10 years in prison.
After initially fighting the charges, the two women are now the fourth and fifth defendants to plead guilty in the case, leaving NXIVM founder Keith Raniere to stand trial alone next month.
Friday’s turn marks the final unraveling of the once ultra-secretive “self-help” organization founded by Raniere in Albany, New York, over two decades ago. In what prosecutors now believe was a front for a “cult-like” pyramid scheme, the 58-year-old’s inner circle allegedly recruited thousands of followers to pay for “executive success” training programs around the country.
Prosecutors allege Bronfman helped Raniere steal email passwords from “perceived enemies,” laundered money to help a non-citizen enter the U.S. in the name of the program’s success, and paid off debts the founder racked up with a dead girlfriend’s credit card. Russell is accused of helping Bronfman and Raniere smuggle the non-citizen into the US .
“NXIVM was not a criminal enterprise but instead was an organization that helped thousands of people,” Bronfman’s attorney, Susan Necheles, insisted in a statement after her arrest.
Investigators opened an investigation into the organization after former members accused Raniere’s sidekick, Smallville actress Allison Mack, of inducting women into a secret sect of the group called DOS—which is loosely translated to “Lord/Master of the Obedient Female Companions”—in which “slaves” would allegedly be forced to have sex with Raniere , or “The Vanguard,” and brand themselves with his initials.
In March 2018, federal authorities arrested Keith Raniere on a variety of charges related to DOS, including sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy, and conspiracy to commit forced labor. He has also been charged with two counts of sexual exploitation of a child and one count of possession for child pornography. Raniere has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
Mack was arrested and charged on similar sex tracking charges one month later.
NXIVM president and co-founder Nancy Salzman , her daughter Lauren Salzman, and Mack have all pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy in the last six weeks.
“I’m very sorry for the victims of this case,” Mack said in court on April 8. “I’m very sorry for who I’ve hurt through my misguided adherence to Keith Raniere’s teachings.”
Opening statements in Raniere’s criminal trial are scheduled for May 7 in Brooklyn. He remains in custody at a federal detention facility without bond."
‘I Still Have Nightmares’: Tortured Turpin Children Speak at Parents’ Sentencing in ‘House of Horrors’ Case,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/house-of-horrors-children-speak-at-david-and-louise-turpin-sentencing,"‘TAKING MY LIFE BACK’ ‘I Still Have Nightmares’: Tortured Turpin Children Speak at Parents’ Sentencing in ‘House of Horrors’ Case A judge sentenced David and Louise Turpin to life in prison for their ‘selfish, cruel, and inhumane’ treatment of their children. 04.19.19 2:20 PM ET Damian Dovarganes/Reuters
The children of David and Louise Turpin shared emotional statements in court Friday as their parents were sentenced to life in prison for torturing, starving, and holding them hostage for years.
In February, the California couple pleaded guilty in Riverside County Superior Court to torture and dependent abuse as well as several counts of false imprisonment, child endangerment, and adult abuse in the “house of horrors” case that shocked the country. The abuse came to light in January 2018, when their 17-year-old daughter escaped from their Perris home and used her brother’s cellphone to call 911.
“My parents took my whole life from me but now I’m taking my life back,” one of the couple’s 13 children, identified as Jane Doe #4, tearfully said in court. “I’m a fighter, I’m strong and I’m shooting through life like a rocket.”
Before the hearing, the judge allowed the victims to speak under the guise of anonymity.
“I’m in college now and living independently,” the daughter added . “I love hanging out with my friends and life is great. I believe everything happens for a reason. Life may have been bad, but it made me strong. I fought to become the person I am.”
Prosecutors allege the Turpins abused 12 of their 13 children, routinely shackling, beating, and starving them in an act of torture and neglect so severe it stunted the growth of some of the kids. Two of the Turpin daughters are now unable to bear children as a result of the abuse.
The siblings, who ranged in age from 2 to 29, were isolated from the outside world in their home about 60 miles outside of Los Angeles and were denied showers, medical care, and sometimes even food, prosecutors said. As punishment, the children were tied up for “weeks or even months at a time,” Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin said.
When authorities arrived to the house after the daughter’s call, she didn’t know what month it was or what the word medication meant. She claimed she hadn’t been bathed in months.
“I cannot describe in words what we went through growing up. Sometimes I still have nightmares of things that had happened, such as my siblings being chained up or getting beaten. But that is the past and this is now,” one of the couple’s sons said Friday, adding that he loves his parents and now forgives them for “a lot of the things that they did to us.”
On Friday, Superior Court Judge Bernard J. Schwartz sentenced the pair to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years for their “selfish, cruel and inhumane” treatment, a ruling previously agreed upon with the Riverside County District Attorney’s Office.
“The only reason your punishment is less than the maximum is that you took responsibility and spared your children the harm of reliving it,” Schwartz said in court.
The parents had an opportunity to speak before the sentencing, each showing remorse for their actions and tearfully asking their children for forgiveness.
“I’m sorry for everything I’ve done to hurt my children,” Louise Turpin said . “I love them more than they could ever imagine.”
David Turpin broke down in tears before he addressed the court, prompting his attorney to read his hand-written statement, which expressed hope his children will “remain” close since their parents will “not be with them.”
“I thank God for all of my children,” the father’s statement read , adding that he is sorry “if I’ve done anything to cause them harm.”"

A California music instructor who allegedly gave teenagers flutes tainted with semen has been indicted with committing lewd acts against minors, authorities announced Thursday night.
John Zeretzke, the 60-year-old founder of the Flutes Across the World who already faces federal child-exploitation charges, was indicted in Orange County Superior Court for six criminal counts of committing lewd acts against five children under the age of 14, the California Attorney General’s Office announced Thursday.
“Crimes against children are despicable. Schools must represent a safe environment for our students,” said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. “No parent should fear for the safety and security of their child at school. We will work relentlessly to hold people who exploit our children criminally accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”
According to the indictment , Zeretzke committed “a lewd and lascivious act upon and with the body and certain parts” of two girls in Orange County and three girls in Los Angeles County, all “under the age of 14 years with the intent of arousing, appealing to and gratifying (his) lust, passions and sexual desires.” The charges, which don’t go into detail about the exact nature of the alleged abuse, are “not based upon allegations that he personally had physical contact with any child.”
Zeretzke founded the international program in 2009, working with thousands of children across the U.S. to create and decorate a pair of flutes out of PVC pipe. At the end of the program, each kid was allowed to keep one flute, while the other was given to children in other countries, including the Philippines where the organization had a field office, according to authorities.
California officials began investigating reports that flutes distributed to children in several Orange County school districts “were tainted with semen” in 2017, a spokesperson at the attorney general’s office told The Daily Beast on Friday.
After the investigation began, all six California schools districts associated with Flutes Across the World discontinued the program.
On Sept. 13, 2017, Zeretzke was charged in a five-count federal indictment claiming the 60-year-old music director coerced a girl to “produce child pornography,” traveled to the Philippines to engage in sex with multiple minors, and attempted to entice another child to send him sexually explicit images. He was released from custody on bond five days after his arrest in 2017, according to federal booking records.
“We believe he contacted these individuals over the internet,” Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, told The Daily Beast. He added that prosecutors do not believe he met any of his victims through the flute program.
Zeretzke, who did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment, has pleaded not-guilty to the new charges, the attorney general’s office said. It is not immediately clear if he has a lawyer. His next court hearing is scheduled for May 1."
"Russia’s Mueller Report: If Putin Did It, He Did It for You",www.thedailybeast.com,Julia Davis,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/russian-state-tv-spins-mueller-report-if-putin-did-it-he-did-it-for-you,"PUTIN ALWAYS WINS Russia’s Mueller Report: If Putin Did It, He Did It for You Kremlin-controlled hosts say brighter days are coming for everyday Russians, now that President Trump is cleared to give them their spoils of the information war. 04.19.19 11:14 AM ET Alexander Nemenov/REUTERS
Russian state-TV viewers on Thursday were delivered a different conclusion from Robert Mueller’s report: Putin always wins. And now everyday Russians are going to win, too.
In the rest of the world, the Justice Department’s redacted version of the special counsel’s report concluded Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election “in sweeping and systematic fashion.” He identified numerous links between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign, establishing that “the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.”
On Friday, the Kremlin issued a scathing response , feigning disappointment with the investigation’s quality, questioning whether it was a waste of taxpayers’ money, and falsely claiming the report doesn’t contain “a single piece of evidence” of Russian intervention in 2016.
Willfully ignoring Mueller’s conclusions, Russian government officials appeared greatly encouraged by the lack of further indictments stemming from the investigation. Parroting President Trump’s narrative, state-media outlet RT on Thursday posted the link to Mueller’s report, prefaced by : “SPOILER ALERT: No ‘collusion’” “Collusion” has no legal definition and is not a federal crime—therefore, the Mueller report did not make a determination on “collusion.”
Unburdened by the facts, Russian state-TV hosts and experts were happy to repeat Trump’s mantra—“No collusion, no obstruction”—throughout the investigation.
They seem further emboldened by the recent visit by Fiona Hill , a Trump adviser who held talks in Moscow on April 17 with several Russian officials. U.S. Special Envoy on North Korea Steven Biegun is also in Moscow this week , ahead of the upcoming meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Vladimir Soloviev, host of Russian state-TV shows Moscow. Kremlin. Putin and The Evening , proudly surmised that Americans can’t solve any problems without Moscow, and are “wavering” and ready to talk. The host and experts jointly concluded that Trump’s hands seem to be untied, because the Mueller investigation’s ending has opened a new era of diplomatic relations between the White House and the Kremlin.
Collusion and obstruction denials aside, there were begrudging acknowledgments that the Mueller report did indeed confirm Moscow’s campaign of election interference.
Nevertheless, Kremlin-controlled state media on Thursday was encouraging its audiences with the notion that economic sanctions have now been exhausted and will soon be replaced with conciliatory gestures. Average Russians are being sold on the idea that Putin’s long-term strategy is bound to pay off. According to the Russian state TV, Putin always wins—even when he loses.
That trusty narrative also surfaced in the special counsel’s investigation.
Heavily redacted sections of Mueller’s report revealed that “at approximately 2:40 a.m. on Nov. 9, 2016, news reports stated that candidate Clinton had called President-elect Trump to concede,” prompting an unnamed individual, who traveled to New York alongside the Kremlin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov, to send a message to the CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Kirill Dmitriev . The message was simple: “Putin has won.”
This line of thinking wasn’t limited to communications taking place behind the scenes. In recent years, Russian state media has made a habit out of boasting about the Kremlin’s successful influence operation, brazenly asserting “Trump is ours,” mocking the American intelligence community for sleeping “while Russia elected a new U.S. president,” and joking that U.S. lawmakers traveled to Russia “to make deals with our hackers so they can rig the midterms in favor of Trump’s team.” In line with Trump’s “locker-room talk” explanations, the Kremlin’s mouthpieces have consistently claimed these statements are meant only as jokes or sarcasm. In reality, they represent a thinly veiled pride at the reach and success of Russia’s ongoing info-ops against the U.S. Experts say a coordinated online disinformation campaign targeting 2020 elections is already underway , using techniques developed and refined by the Kremlin during the U.S. presidential elections in 2016.
Evgeny Popov, the host of 60 Minutes, the most popular state TV program in Russia as of 2018, is defiant about the findings in the Mueller report. Popov tells me : “Soon, we will help you elect Trump once again. Just like the last time. Get ready!”"

This week: Stop everything and watch Homecoming . The best part of the Game of Thrones premiere. Really? A modern-day Oklahoma! ? The Big Little Lies trailer arrived. Very important Antoni from Queer Eye news. Beyoncé Is So Damn Good It Hurts
This week’s edition of The Daily Beast’s OBSESSED is coming to you from a higher plane of existence, from which I now reside after watching Beyoncé’s Homecoming documentary and concert special on Netflix.
My vision is corrected. My pores are cleared. My anxiety is gone. My future is boundless, and without hangovers. The air is crisper. Colors are brighter. There are no more nightmares, only dreams involving sex with Jake Gyllenhaal. This morning, the cashier at Dunkin Donuts handed me my coffee and said, “Here’s your change. You are a gift to this world.” The subway arrived on time. Beyoncé did that.
You see, Beyoncé is peerless, the kind of unrivaled superstar who invites that kind of hyperbole. She’s been at the top of her game for two decades, and yet is still throwing down the gauntlet: Homecoming , which chronicles the making of and shows off the brilliance of her 2018 Coachella set celebrating HBCU culture, proves she is the Greatest Living Entertainer.
There may be better vocalists, artists with more musicianship, and others who are more cunning provocateurs. But no one lassos showmanship, craft, identity, tradition, ingenuity, politics, sex, and plain-old bops from the different corners of culture where they usually reside disparately—especially in the music landscape—and marries them in her power.
It’s transcendent because she’s so meticulous about it. Every person on stage with her, every bead on her costume, every beat of the drum, twitch of her neck, direction of her gaze, and snarl in her voice has purpose. Multiplied on the scale that it was for the Coachella performance, with risers filled with musicians, dancers, and vocalists, it was one of the most stunning things that I’ve ever seen. It had so much swag, and so much beauty. I was struck especially by the jubilance of it all. It was a celebration.
I’m more than aware that I’m Whitey McCracker O’Caucasian writing about all this. But that, at least I think, is part of Beyoncé’s gift. Homecoming is a rapturous celebration of black culture that must be meaningful in a way that I can’t speak to. But as a good friend pointed out to me, it showcases a culture that is so American that, by bearing witness to it, it’s almost as if we all should feel more American, too.
And the work—the work—that went into this. Beyoncé spent eight grueling months crafting this for us, because she felt like we deserved it. The amount of dedication to the craft. More, the amount of certainty that we needed it. There’s no one else. Beyoncé is it. Want this in your inbox? Subscribe here. Jaime Lannister Is the Best Game of Thrones Character
Of all the schemers having incest on Game of Thrones , Jaime Lannister is by far my favorite. Without a doubt, he is the most captivating of all the people having sex with a relative but also going through an existential moral crisis on this drama series. And that is why, when he finally arrived in Sunday night’s Thrones premiere , I squealed with delight. His scene was the best scene!
In the last minute of the episode, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’s Jaime is seemingly the last of the main actors to arrive back in Winterfell. He takes off his helmet, sending hearts-a-putter for the first time in 20 months by revealing his dashing, chiseled, Prince-Charming-in-Shrek good looks. You swoon, remembering all the ways in which Jaime has changed for good. The noble decisions he’s made in the last few seasons. The purest of all the Lannisters, for sure, after standing up to Cersei.
Then he sees Bran. Bran, whom he hasn’t seen since shoving the then-young boy out of a window for the crime of accidentally seeing him banging his twin sister in the show’s first episode. It’s a thrilling face-off, and Coster-Waldau masters the combination “oh shit I’m still so pissed at you” and “oh shit I’m scared of you still” in his staredown. But it’s also a brilliant reminder that this guy is just as much a monster as everyone else on this damn show. I almost forget!
I have no idea who will end up on the Iron Throne. I couldn’t even begin to guess who will die. But, as a casual watcher, these are the moments that I enjoy the most. The reveals are amazing. No one does a narrative payoff better than this show, like the Jamie-Bran reunion proves. Other shows do a lot of other things way better—you know, like character development and plot coherence—but few get me as excited to settle down for my Sunday night squeals of delighted surprise. I’ve Never Been More Intrigued By a TV Pitch
There’s a bright golden haze on the meadow, and this time it’s probably due to smog and some air pollution, y’all! It was announced this week that a modern-day version of the classic Rodgers & Hammerstein musical Oklahoma! is coming sweeping down the plain and right to your TV screen.
The timing is clever, with New York all abuzz and aroused over a revisionist Broadway production of the show that reimagines the characters as much hornier than you’d remember from that version you starred in during senior year of high school, and which portrays the show’s nostalgic promise of manifest destiny as much darker and more macabre.
It’s unclear how edgy this new TV version will be, or how writer John Lee Hancock and Bekah Brunstetter plan to modernize an entire second act revolving around cowboys and farmers purchasing women at a box social. But I’m at the very least excited to see my beloved buffoon Will Parker, the second-banana character I played in high school.
Obviously, my rendition of “Kansas City” brought down the house, though there was a part where I was meant to jump onto a fence and the fence broke when I landed on it. The entire audience laughed and loved it, but anyway that was the start of my weight anxiety and this whole story is basically me in a nutshell. Of Course the Big Little Lies Trailer Is Excellent
I under no circumstances thought they should have greenlit a second season of Big Little Lies , since the original iteration of the HBO drama was the rare show, I think, to be actually perfect. (I named it The Daily Beast’s top show of 2017 .)
That said, the just-released trailer for this ill-advised second season is exceptionally cut, thus moving up the date of my inevitable copping to loving the new season, thinking it’s a wonderful idea, and exposing myself as a hypocrite. The way Reese Witherspoon gasps her breath in the last second just won an Emmy. ( Watch it here .) Antoni From Queer Eye Used to Star in Musicals?
It came to the attention of Gay Twitter this week that Antoni from Queer Eye , long before bringing avocados into the kitchens of straight men all across rural America, co-starred in a production of the Legally Blonde musical . It was in 2011 at New York City’s Neighborhood Playhouse, where he apparently studied acting, and also featured Halt and Catch Fire’s Mackenzie Davis as Elle Woods.
This is all to say there is a handsome reward waiting for the person who sends me video of this. (The reward is a hug from me!)
What to watch this week:
Someone Great : Gina! Rodriguez! In! A! Rom-com!
Gentleman Jack : It’s British and weird and fun.
Little Woods: The Oscar goes to whoever thought to cast Tessa Thompson and Lily James as co-leads.
Under the Silver Lake : This was a see/skip toss up, as it very much loses its way. But a riveting start lands it here.
What to skip this week:
The Curse of La Llorona : I mean the name alone, people.
Guava Island : How could a Donald Glover/Rihanna film manage to feel like a waste? NEWSLETTERS The Daily Beast’s Obsessed Everything we can’t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture. Subscribe"

Joshua Lott for The Washington Post via Getty
The phrase “LGBT Christian” might sound dissonant and strange.
After all, the last several decades of public discourse about issues like sodomy laws , marriage equality and transgender restroom use have often reduced them to a cage match: LGBT people in one corner, religious people in the other. Fight!
But Pete Buttigieg is complicating that all-too-neat notion. Whatever the fate of his candidacy for president, the openly gay and proudly Episcopal mayor is making it impossible to pretend as though the intersection of faith and LGBT life is empty.
Perhaps nowhere has the candidate done this with more precision than he did during a Victory Fund speech earlier this month when he called out Vice President Mike Pence, saying “My marriage to [my husband] Chasten has made me a better man and yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God.”
That assertion is all the more brilliant for its rhetorical simplicity: Same-sex marriage is a religious issue, Buttigieg is saying, for him and for many other LGBT people of faith.
Not every LGBT person in a same-sex couple feels the same way. (My marriage to my wife, for example, hasn’t moved me closer to God but it has moved me closer to health insurance coverage.) Even still, though Buttigieg’s distinctly gay intertwining of faith and family is a sorely-needed gesture at a cultural moment like this, when anti-LGBT groups are continuing to use “religious liberty” as a cover for discrimination.
Although it’s true that LGBT Americans are generally less religious than our non-LGBT counterparts, a large plurality do identify as Christian. According to a 2015 report from the Pew Research Center, 72 percent of straight Americans say they are Christian, which is much higher than the 48 percent of gay , lesbian , and bisexual Americans who report the same. But 48 percent is still nearly half, and it’s still more than the 41 percent of LGB Americans who told Pew that they weren’t affiliated with any religion.
Put simply: The odds of any LGBT American you meet being a Christian are roughly the same as a coin flip.
Looking specifically at transgender Americans might also prove surprising, given the past four years of discourse pitting the community against pastors and church leaders.
Twenty-one percent of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey identify as Christian, and four percent as Jewish, which together outnumber the 21 percent who identify as atheist.
Transgender people do appear to be less religious—based on this early data—than their cisgender gay, lesbian, and bisexual peers, which makes sense given the rigidity of many religions when it comes to gender fluidity.
But regardless, given that there are an estimated 1.4 million transgender adults in the United States , some back-of-the-envelope math would suggest that there could be a population of nearly 300,000 transgender Christians and over 50,000 transgender Jews.
So although Pete Buttigieg might be drawing unique media attention to the concept of being “both Christian and gay,” as Vox put it , he is not alone: There are millions of LGBT Americans who practice a faith—and they’ve been done a disservice by a media that often conflates anti-LGBT politicking with the religious beliefs used as a guise for it.
“I don’t have a problem with religion,” Buttigieg recently told Ellen DeGeneres . “I’m religious, too. I have a problem with religion being used as a justification to harm people and especially in the LGBTQ community.”
Indeed, part of the candidate’s exploding popularity in recent weeks seems to be because he has carved out space in the public sphere for religious progressives: In a determined way, Buttigieg is trying to reclaim the discourse around religion from an increasingly small—if still remarkably powerful—contingent of anti-LGBT Christians.
After all, it’s worth remembering that most religious Americans actually oppose anti-LGBT discrimination. According to the latest numbers from the Public Religion Research Institute, 80 percent of Jews, 71 percent of white mainstream Protestants, 70 percent of Mormons , and roughly 70 percent of Catholics support nondiscrimination protections for LGBT people. In fact, according to PRRI, a slim majority of white evangelicals—54 percent—support LGBT nondiscrimination, too.
There’s no reason why the minority of anti-LGBT evangelical Christians should own the conversation around faith in this country—and however Buttigieg fares during the 2020 cycle, he has already claimed his place in that public dialogue.
What gives his efforts a boost is the fact that his comments on his own faith have a ring of truth to them. Many political candidates—regardless of political party—do not sound nearly as convincing when they talk about their personal faith. “When he talks about God, Pete Buttigieg sounds like he’s speaking from the heart”
On the left, religion often feels like a necessary bone that candidates throw to a more believing general electorate. On the right, religion is often used as a synonym for a certain kind of exclusionary conception of the family—one that leaves LGBT people out.
Few and far between are elected officials who can actually talk about the role faith plays in their personal lives in a way that feels earnest. Indeed, while some of Buttigieg’s interview answers can sound overly polished—a bit too much like the perfect thing to say—when he talks about God, Buttigieg sounds like he’s speaking from the heart.
In explaining why he considers marriage equality a “moral issue” during his Victory Fund speech , for example, Buttigieg explained: “It’s a moral issue because being married to Chasten has made me a better human being—because it has made me more compassionate, more understanding, more self-aware and more decent.”
When was the last time you heard a political candidate talk about morality in a direct and non-euphemistic way—to talk simply about becoming a better person rather than pontificate about the right way to form a family?
That’s why the Buttigieg-Pence matchup is so invigorating: On one hand, a candidate who talks about faith straightforwardly, not as something that conflicts with his sexual orientation but that can exist harmoniously alongside it. (“Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator,” Buttigieg often says to Pence, asserting that God made him gay.) On the other hand, a vice president who has yet to condemn conversion therapy .
There’s a reason, too, that Buttigieg is “winning” that political match-up as Rolling Stone declared—and that the South Bend mayor sounds as convincing as he does when he talks about his beliefs: As a bisexual friend of mine recently put it, “If you’re gay and you’re still good with God, then you must really be good with God.”
In other words, LGBT Americans who grew up in certain faith traditions have probably been through the gauntlet. For many, those trials lead to a loss of faith. Those who keep their faith often believe so ardently that they are willing to take longer arriving at self-acceptance. (Consider that Buttigieg didn’t come out as gay until he was 33.)
Buttigieg himself has endorsed something like this notion: “You may be religious and you may not,” he said at his Victory Fund speech, to a largely LGBT audience. “But if you are, and you are also queer, and you have come through the other side of a period of wishing that you weren’t, then you know that that message—this idea that there is something wrong with you—is a message that puts you at war not only with yourself but with your Maker.”
Like many LGBT people of faith who struggle to come out, Buttigieg has won that war with himself—and ultimately maintained a belief in his Maker. To him, the idea of being a “LGBT Christian” doesn’t seem strange because he is one. And if he keeps talking about his religion this vocally, it won’t be long before that notion seems normal.

How Porn Stars Balance Sex Work and Parenting: ‘My Kids Are Trained to Respect Privacy’,www.thedailybeast.com,Aurora Snow,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-porn-stars-manage-sex-work-and-parenting-my-kids-are-trained-to-respect-privacy,"How Porn Stars Balance Sex Work and Parenting: ‘My Kids Are Trained to Respect Privacy’ Getty Aurora Snow 04.20.19 3:12 AM ET
M ILF. Mom. Stepmom. All three terms made Pornhub’s top-10 most-searched in 2018. Women’s No. 1 searched term in 2018 was “Daddy,” according to xHamster’s trend report. As the interest in fauxcest continues to climb , adult performers are increasingly fetishized as parents—but for some porn stars, being a mommy (or daddy) isn’t just sexy role-play, it’s real life. Not only do adult performers struggle with striking the same work-life balance as everyone else, they have the added responsibility of keeping their careers hush-hush. Some performers keep their two lives so segregated, they won’t even admit to being parents; others create boundaries and a framework within which to abide by.
Known as the “Taboo MILF,” Penny Barber has made a career out of indulging these types of desires, and much of her site focuses on mommy-son role-play. Barber happens to be a mother off-screen, too. Her kids, who are in elementary school, think Mom makes indie movies—which isn’t entirely untrue. Keeping her work separated from her kids’ realm feels “effortless” once the foundational limits were established, one of which is privacy.
“My kids are trained to respect privacy, which I assume other parents don’t have to worry about as much,” says Barber. “For example, if they see that I’m on my computer, they have to ask, ‘May I approach?’ before they come over, just in case I’m editing on Photoshop or have my email open or something.” Barber’s also taken additional precautions, like setting her computer to log out when it’s not in use.
While Barber’s flexible schedule grants her more time to spend with her kids than a nine-to-five would’ve allowed for, she’s also made a conscious decision to isolate herself from the other parents. “I can’t be involved with my kids’ school. I don’t volunteer and I try not to engage with other parents. You never know who’s going to start a rumor or who’s going to try to feel big by outing you,” says Barber. “I’d rather the other parents think I’m standoffish than have my children bullied or ostracized.”
Refraining from PTA involvement to avoid recognition, porn star Leya Falcon has imposed similar boundaries where her preteen daughter is concerned. “I get scared that someone will recognize me and take it out on her,” says Falcon. “I have no shame in what I do but I don’t want to tell her until it’s the right time, in an age-appropriate manner.” Falcon credits her career with the financial independence and flexibility to both provide for her daughter and be there to guide her as she grows.
Raising her son far from porn valley, Kiki Daire drew strict lines between her work as Kiki and her role as mom. Conversations about her career were muted, and there were a lot of topics Daire says were “off-limits” when her son was around. “I kept him far away from everything when he was a kid; he didn’t even come to L.A. until he was 18,” says Daire. “Anybody that knows me knows I look homeless half the time when I’m not working and part of that is on purpose. I don’t want to deal with being Kiki Daire all the time, especially when it’s family time.” “ I think the most important thing to realize is that we can raise well-adjusted, happy kids. ”
Despite these boundary lines, Daire’s son found out what she did for a living when he was just 12 years old—and not in the way you’d expect either. “My father’s brother and his wife decided it was time for him to be told, so they told him and made it sound a lot worse than it was,” says Daire. “I was furious, but at that point all I could do was sit him down and say, ‘OK do you have any questions?’” Looking back, Daire says it’s never easy being a parent, especially when you’re in the adult industry, but “I think the most important thing to realize is that we can raise well-adjusted, happy kids.”
“When I am home and not working I joke that all my followers know that because I don’t wear much makeup,” shares adult actress Sara St. Clair. “My son is 7 so he doesn’t know just yet, all he knows is mommy travels for work. He’s never asked just yet but if and when he does I’ll tell him I’m an actress and a model—a half truth.”
Living in the Bible Belt, St. Clair is keenly aware of the stigma associated with her career and strives to raise her son with an open mind while shielding him from judgmental views. “The stigma and mommy guilt is rough. I love my son and I love my job but people so often make me feel guilty, like I shouldn’t have both. I try to ignore it but sometimes it does get to me,” she confesses. “For industry moms, waitresses, CEOs, bosses—don’t let anyone shame you for being a working mom.”
Adult performer Foxxy feels she’s just like any other working parent—the job itself hasn’t impacted how she raises her kids. “I always travel for work, so they know when I’m leaving that it’s work-related and I’ll be back when I’m done. Once I get to where my job is, I jump in a phone booth and come out like superwoman and take off. I’m kidding but truly I feel like it,” says Foxxy. “Once I’m done with work and traveling I jump on a plane and fly home. Once I land my game face changes back into the co-parent. I don’t speak of work and they never ask.”
Parents in the adult industry are judged harshly—not so much for their parenting styles but for their career choices. One has nothing to do with the other, says performer Alexander Ace. With a 9-month-old at home, the new dad can’t predict what he’ll say about his career as an adult performer or what boundaries he’ll deem necessary to set in the future. Regardless, Ace plans to parent with honesty. “How we raise our children will dictate how they act. Just because we do adult films doesn’t mean they’ll grow up to be sexually deviant. What we do isn’t going to dictate what our children do, it’s how we raise them,” says Ace. “A few decades ago, same-sex couples couldn’t adopt children because it was thought the kids would grow up to be sexually deviant if they were raised by two fathers or two mothers but that’s not true either.”
Despite the obstacles and judgments endured, well-known MILF performer Karen Fisher says her occupation made being a single parent possible. “When my daughter was young, I was around most days after school to help her with her homework. If she was sick, I never had to scramble to find a sitter. Most parents don’t have that luxury,” offers Fisher. Nonetheless, Fisher kept quiet about how she made her living, fearing her daughter would be mistreated because of her career. “As adult performers, we’re often judged harshly,” says Fisher. “Even some of our fans look at us as less than human.”
An occupation doesn’t dictate how a person will parent, or if they’ll be good or bad at it, regardless of whether that person is a doctor or a sex worker."

The Best Reason to Visit Cleveland? To See a Dead Man,www.thedailybeast.com,william.oconnor@thedailybeast.com (William O’Connor),04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/visiting-cleveland-you-should-go-see-this-dead-man,"IT'S STILL A BIG WORLD The Best Reason to Visit Cleveland? To See a Dead Man Getty I really knew nothing about this city except that it was the metropolis around which so much of American politics in the last century and a half has revolved. 04.19.19 10:39 PM ET
I came to Cleveland to see a dead man.
Not just any dead man, but a dead man whose gruesome death left America shaken and unsure of its new place as a stable world power—a dead man who probably has not crossed your mind more than once or twice.
On a grassy rise in Lake View Cemetery (a macabre carnival of sorts for the history nerd) an odd Victorian Gothic tower appears, crowned by a spire. I say odd not because it’s misshapen, but because while there are certainly any number of spectacular mausoleums in this scenic 285-acre expanse, this sandstone folly is more something one would expect to find in a country estate designed by H. H. Richardson. For those curious enough to venture in, it contains an outrageously over-the-top memorial and tomb filled with Murano glass mosaics, expensive marble, and lofty architectural details befitting a conquering European monarch à la Napoleon or the fatuous “grand” duke Medici.
Instead it contains the remains and a soaring statue of the most forgettable of presidents (James Garfield) in the era of forgettable presidents (post-Reconstruction). Ask anybody to recite the presidents in order, and there are three periods that trip them up. Between Van Buren (Jackson, let’s be honest) and Lincoln. Between Wilson and FDR. And between Grant and McKinley. The last decades of the 19th century may have been the era that propelled the U.S. to what Henry Luce called the American Century, but its leaders were often caricatures of machine politics and corruption—pygmies masquerading as a colossus, as the late Robert Byrd might say.
Actually, maybe I’m being unfair to Garfield. He wasn’t the most forgettable (that goes to Hayes or Harrison). Instead, Garfield gets remembered because just four months after being inaugurated as president, he was shot in the back at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington, D.C, which no longer exists and was where the National Gallery stands today. In a twist of fate, Abraham Lincoln’s son, Robert, who was Garfield’s secretary of war was a witness to the assassination by Charles J. Guiteau. (Although, wait, scratch that. Because if you’re playing the president assassination trivia game, Garfield is definitely the name that you can’t remember.) Then he suffers horribly for months as “doctors” attempting to save him rummaged around in his body for the bullet (including Alexander Graham Bell, who tried to use an early version of a metal detector) only to leave him even worse off from infection. All told, the self-made man who rose up from a log cabin to become leader of the nascent American world power spent a third of his presidency in a bed in unimaginable agonizing pain.
I was also in Cleveland because, I hate to admit, I really knew nothing about this city except it being the metropolis around which so much of American politics in the last century and a half has revolved.
Thus it seemed like an ideal candidate for a series we have at Beast Travel that I love— It’s Still a Big World . Twice a month we take our readers to a destination they’ve likely never considered and try to crack it open and reveals the wonders it may hold inside.
And, as I discovered this month, Cleveland certainly does have wonders.
Don’t get me wrong, it’s unlikely travelers from across the country or world are going to be journeying to Ohio just for Cleveland’s touristic offerings. But , if you happen to be there for work or health (Cleveland Clinic), considering where to stop on a northern cross-country road trip, or a history buff exploring mid-size American cities—there’s a lot here for you.
First, the two things essential for any urban destination worth your time—places to eat and sleep. As for eating, like many cities across the U.S. that coastal elites might have once blanched at dining in, Cleveland has upped its game in recent years. It has a number of James Beard Award-winning chefs, and a number of spaces throughout the city that nail good food and great ambiance. Two can’t-miss options that made my time memorable were Marble Room and The Plum.
Marble Room Steak and Raw Bar is the high-end dining spot in the jaw-dropping former National City Bank in the Garfield Building downtown. Think ornate coffered ceilings, hulking marble Corinthian columns, and underground vaults converted into private dining rooms. All you need to know is that in addition to being a gorgeous space, it nails the staples as I had fantastic oysters and wolfed down my cut of meat. (I do have one annoying quibble however. They’ve created this swanky space but the salt and pepper shakers front and center on every table look cheap.)
The Plum, located in lively Ohio City just across the river from downtown, is a must for those who like the combination of an inventive menu in a cute and playful space. I’d recommend starting with the kale sprouts, but the menu changes every couple weeks depending on what can be sourced from nearby farms.
The city also has a bevy of breweries and low-key fare. One of the best Reubens I’ve ever had were found here at Lox, Stock, and Brisket, and all the sandwiches I wolfed down at Larder were delicious. Those looking for hearty breakfast/brunch options won’t go wrong at Lucky’s Cafe over in Tremont, just a couple blocks from the iconic St. Theodosius Orthodox Cathedral. And of course no visit to Cleveland would be complete without a stop in its historic West Side Market in Ohio City.
As far as where to lay your head, there’s plenty of modern options from the Marriott at Key Center to the Hilton Downtown to the Ritz-Carlton, but one of the most fascinating things about Cleveland has been the rush in recent years to transform one-of-a-kind historic buildings into hotels. The Drury is in the former Board of Education building, the Kimpton in the former Scofield building, the Metropolitan at the 9 in a Breuer tower, and the Hyatt Regency in the truly jaw-dropping Arcade.
If there’s a social-media friendly show-stopper in Cleveland, it’s without a doubt the Arcade. Built in 1890 and financed by tycoons like John D. Rockefeller (Standard Oil was founded here), it was one of the earliest indoor malls in the U.S. and certainly one of its most glamorous. It is lined on both sides by five stories of completely reserved retail and crowned by a huge glass skylight running the length of the building. While it’s said to be inspired by the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, that’s a bit of a stretch as the Arcade screams turn-of-the-century American in its overall aesthetic.
In fact, Cleveland as a whole screams turn-of-the-century America. And when I say screams, I’m only exaggerating a little bit. Nearly every single person I interacted with reminded me that Cleveland was once the fifth-largest city in the U.S., and according to one study at that time had more self-made millionaires than any city in the world. (For those looking for an easily digestible walk-through of the city, the Cleveland History Center on former Millionaire’s Row is a great place to start.) Those millionaires left behind cultural treasures that many big cities around the world would kill for, including the world-class Cleveland Museum of Art that is free to the public. Two paintings any visitor should not miss, the photograph-like Twilight in the Wilderness by Frederic Edwin Church and my fiery favorite of J.M.W. Turner’s series The Burning of the Houses of Lords and Commons , 16 October 1834.
The crown jewel in its cultural collection however, has to be Severance Hall (built in 1931), home to the Cleveland Orchestra. Cleveland’s orchestra is perennially ranked one of the best in the world (as is its Music Institute, which performed Mahler’s Fifth when I was in town). And Severance Hall is, in a word, glorious. The only hint on the restrained exterior of the decorative explosion inside is the Art Deco pediment above the entrance. Inside, a visual assault of sorts begins with rose-colored marble columns and staircases in the grand foyer, complemented by gold and Egyptian Revival decorative motifs. And the theater itself is an unforgettable silvery icon of Art Moderne decoration with its streamlined swirls.
Cleveland’s downtown and University Circle neighborhoods are lined with buildings that mark the battle between the on-its-way-out Beaux-Arts and the rise of a new American architecture coming out of the Midwest best articulated by Louis Sullivan .
But nowhere marks this battle better than the most unlikely of places—the same Lake View Cemetery with the Garfield Memorial that brought me here in the first place. Its mausoleums and gravestones run the gamut from stereotypical neoclassical to art deco to ultra modern. While popular this time of year for its blooms (including the 100,000 plug blooms on Daffodil Hill), the cemetery is a nerd’s heaven. Taking one of the tours offered by the cemetery is a Wikipedia rabbit hole in real time of oft-forgotten tycoons, society dames, politicos, and other notables whose life stories bring the cemetery to, um , life. Elliott Ness is buried there, as is Ray Johnson Chapman (only player to die from an injury in a MLB game when he got hit by Carl Mays in the head), disc jockey Alan Freed (the back of his stone has a jukebox carved in), GOP political boss Mark Hanna, Coburn Haskell (inventor of rubber-core golf ball), and John D. Rockefeller (his 70-foot obelisk is the tallest in the cemetery). Levi Scofield, the architect whose masterpieces dot the city, has a beautiful mausoleum with pink marble columns at the entrance.
Perhaps the most famous, however, is Wade Memorial Chapel, the non-denominational chapel for industrialist Jeptha Wade decorated inside by Louis Comfort Tiffany in a fish-scale rainbow of glass mosaics depicting biblical scenes. Built in 1901 for $270,000 (millions today, if you could find the artisans) it’s still operational for both weddings and funerals.
But I was there, of course, for Garfield. His memorial was constructed in 1890, nine years after his assassination. It was funded by donations from around the country ($225,000) in total and a competition overseen by local industrialists (as Garfield was from the area), including Rockefeller, selected George Keller of Connecticut’s entry for the design. The interior is eclectic Victorian Gothic to the max, with Druid symbols stenciled and mosaic-ed here and there, a Byzantine-esque gold ceiling made from Murano glass, and stained-glass windows (when Tiffany’s bid was too high, they went with H. Walter Lonsdale, of Mount Stuart House fame, in London). Numidian marble from Morocco, red granite from Nova Scotia, and blue Belgian marble round out the space’s opulence. And of course there is the statue itself, standing 6’9” in white Carrara marble (it was the second attempt as in the first block a flaw was found partway through). The real Garfield stood at six foot, 200 pounds and was a former wrestler. My favorite nugget about his bio? While in college at Williams he dated three women simultaneously!
Now, he’s laid to rest in the vault beneath his grand statue in a marble sarcophagus next to that of his wife (who was also his former student). In the first year he was first placed there, according to the docent, 690,000 people visited. Today, if you go (open from April 1-November 19), you might just have the place to yourself. And if you venture up the spiral staircase to the balcony you will have on a clear day the best view of this truly American city one can find."

Maybe we need another bout of the same irreverence. 04.19.19 10:38 PM ET Hulton Archive via Getty
LONDON—It was demented from the very first minute. It began with a blast of American military band patriotism, John Philip Sousa’s The Liberty Bell , playing to a graphic montage of bizarre images under the title of Monty Python’s Flying Circus .
Nothing like it had ever been seen on BBC television and even the natives, already familiar with the more surreal reaches of British comedy on BBC radio, took a while to adjust to this new kind of visual humor in which nothing was too sacred to be lampooned: religion, politics, bureaucrats, the military, the Empire, psychiatry, patriotism, culture.
This year is the 50th anniversary of Monty Python’s Flying Circus , a show that at first seemed so peculiarly British that it couldn’t possibly be understood outside these shores let alone attract a global following that eventually spanned many languages and cultures. But that’s exactly what happened. Long before social media, the Python shows went viral through the slower old-fashioned means of syndicated TV sales.
Today, when political life in Britain and America has become populated with figures so absurd that they outstrip the ability of satire to satirize them, a new viewing of Python reminds us that when all else fails mockery is an important last resort in a democracy – and, in the right hands, it can wound beyond the best investigative journalism. It punctures egos and challenges sacred systems.
And as Donald Trump has demonstrated, there is nothing a demagogue detests more than being laughed at . Alec Baldwin’s impersonation of him on Saturday Night Live provoked Trump into calling for “retribution” and including Baldwin in his “enemies of the people” anti-media incitements.
Python did not ridicule individual politicians. It had a broader and deeper thrust, creating a theater of absurdity in which all the characters, however loony, were drawn from contemporary life and from attitudes that had crippled British behavior for generations, particularly those based on class.
Python performances were always a group effort that depended on a cast of six—Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam—each with his own strengths, learning to play off and with the talents of the others. Sometimes it seemed like a mutual therapy session in which passive and aggressive personalities tortured each other to produce convulsive laughter.
A legendary example is the “Dead Parrot” sketch. Cleese plays a customer in a pet store, run by Palin, who is returning a parrot that he claims is dead. This was written, apparently from personal experience, to show how English manners allowed appalling standards of customer service where a shopkeeper could stubbornly resist accepting the return of flawed goods while the customer was too polite to force the issue.
Palin resorts to desperate sales speak to imply that there is nothing actually amiss with the parrot—“it’s resting, it’s stunned”—while Cleese slowly steams to un-British fury – “it’s a late parrot, it’s a stiff.”
Cleese has said that Palin was his favorite foil; the mixture of British social classes they naturally adopted in their sketches—Palin as a crafty pleb and Cleese as a short-fused upper middle class blockhead—became natural to them.
Looking back it’s clear that of the whole troupe of original talents Cleese was the most gifted as a performer. He was physical in a way that the others were not.
As the Python sketches evolved he gradually established a comic personality of his own in the way that Chaplin established the tramp and Jackie Gleason established the belligerent and insecure bus driver Ralph Kramden in The Honeymooners .
Cleese’s invention didn’t have a name in the Python sketches. He was a composite of recognizably English personality disorders. Part of it came from his height—at six feet five inches he loomed ominously above the others as a kind of alienated presence, with a square, tense jaw, basilisk eyes and verbal eruptions that began as a low snarl and ended in manic fury. He took the quintessential uptight English male and revealed the rages within, sometimes to a scary degree.
It was not just Cleese’s height that he deployed to comic effect. His whole body had a plastic virtuosity. In a role that he himself later said he disliked he became the Minister of Funny Walks, a parody of Britain’s multiplying officialism, in which he adopts an extreme form of the fascist goose-step while wearing a bowler hat, bureaucratic suit and carrying a briefcase.
Cleese instinctively understood the importance of accent in the hierarchy of British power. Other Python performers assumed upper class accents when required to be buffoonish, but with Cleese the accent came naturally without comic stress. He understood one of the great English deceptions, that the “right” accent conveys authority regardless of intellect, frequently empowering idiots like the World War I British generals who sent millions to needless deaths with a mindless belief in static warfare.
Eventually this creation acquired a name. In 1975 Cleese introduced to us the character of Basil Fawlty in a BBC comedy series, Fawlty Towers . Within the confines of a small suburban English hotel Cleese and the show’s co-creator, his American wife Connie Booth, encapsulated the worst of Little England: managerial incompetence, xenophobia, racism, staff abuse and inedible food.
And it was funny. So funny that it has just been voted the greatest ever British television comedy by the readers of the British listings magazine, Radio Times . Only 12 episodes were made. Cleese and Booth showed rare discipline in understanding that they had mined gold but probably exhausted the lode. The show’s lasting effect on comedy was immense.
There were 45 episodes of Monty Python . Cleese played little part in the final series. He was more engaged in the Python movies, Monty Python and the Holy Grail , The Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life that introduced a wider global audience to this surrealistic form of blasphemy and disrespect for all forms of authority, whether secular or sacred. “The true catalyst in the creation of Python was David Frost.”
Looking back to the origins of the Python humor all tracks first lead to the BBC. Within a decade from the late 1950s into the 1960s, the public broadcaster was an astonishing creative disruptor, finding and nurturing original talents. Surrealistic comedy broke through first on BBC radio, where, for example, Peter Sellers first emerged as an actor of many voices in The Goon Show .
However, the true catalyst in the creation of Python was David Frost. Frost is remembered now as a formidable television interviewer culminating in his landmark interrogation of Richard Nixon . But at the start of his career he was torn between journalism and stand-up comedy. It took him a while to accept that he was a terrible comedian with a tired routine that was widely mocked by contemporaries including Cleese.
Frost and Cleese had been members of Footlights, a legendary Cambridge University forcing ground for comic talent. Frost was the first of them to earn the title of “television celebrity” when he anchored That Was The Week That Was , another BBC breakout production that later served as the model for Saturday Night Live .
In 1967 Cleese and future Python costar Graham Chapman told Frost about an idea they had for a radical new show. It had an inexplicable name, At Last The 1948 Show , and was a series of unrelated and bizarre sketches to be performed by Cleese, Chapman and several others.
By this time Frost had his own production company and had moved from the BBC to commercial television. He sold the idea to a London commercial station and it went on the air late in 1967. One of its catch-phrases that migrated to Python was “And now for something completely different.” Although it seemed a device to deal with the extreme incongruity of the sketches it was also a private joke.
Cleese and Chapman had served in a comedy writers’ pool that Frost employed for his first commercial television show, The Frost Programme . This live one-hour prime time show punctuated serious interviews with some monologues and stand-up one-liners delivered by Frost and written mostly by the pool—who invariably felt pain from Frost’s performances. “And now for something completely different” was their idea for moving Frost from monologue to journalism.
Thirteen episodes of At Last The 1948 Show were made. When the London commercial station changed hands all of them were wiped. Later, as the show’s significance in television history became apparent (several of its sketches were repeated in Python ) efforts were made to recover copies, including by Cleese, and 11 have now been saved.
Although Frost should get full credit for not only getting the program on the air but understanding and promoting such a radical break from conventional British comedy the tension between his role as a mocked comedian and the Python troupe continued – in one episode of Python they deliberately slipped Frost’s private phone number into a scene, an annoyance that forced him to change the number.
The more famous Frost became as a journalist the more they mocked him and the more he hated it. As a producer of Frost’s show I watched this strange feud unfold and persist. Cleese in particular never lost an opportunity to ridicule “Frostie”—sounding very much like the misanthropic British stereotype he had so brilliantly embodied. It’s all very Pythonesque.

The Disciples’ Argument for Why Jesus Wasn’t a Ghost or a Zombie,www.thedailybeast.com,Candida Moss,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-disciples-argument-for-why-jesus-wasnt-a-ghost-or-a-zombie,"SCARRING The Disciples’ Argument for Why Jesus Wasn’t a Ghost or a Zombie One thing is for sure: long before zombies became a phenomenon in pop culture, the Evangelists were forcefully arguing that Jesus wasn’t one. 04.19.19 10:38 PM ET Getty
Easter Sunday commemorates the resurrection of Jesus following his crucifixion on Good Friday. To many Christians what happened on that day is the heart of the Easter message and the foundation of their faith. To some non-Christians it’s a somewhat macabre folk tale invented by the traumatized disciples of Jesus. But to both groups the question: “What, if anything, did the disciples see?” is of critical importance.
The Gospel writers seem sure that something happened: each of the four Evangelists agree that when the women went to the tomb where Jesus was laid it was empty. Paul, too, tells us that Jesus was resurrected from the dead. Whether or not you believe that Jesus appeared to the disciples, it’s clear that the tradition about it is very early. But it also wasn’t that remarkable; in the ancient world, unlike today, it was fairly common to have an encounter with one’s loved one after their death. As Dr. Meghan Henning , an assistant professor of Christian origins at the University of Dayton, told me, “In the ancient world if someone told you they saw their dead mother you would reply ‘Cool, what did she say?’” There was a broad consensus that you might see your loved ones, but that didn’t mean that they had been resurrected or that they were even that special.
After all, just like in modern science fiction and horror, there was a whole host of ancient supernatural and ghostly figures in the ancient world. What if Jesus was just one of them? You can sense the anxiety about this in the Gospels of Luke and John. In Luke 24:39 Jesus displays his “hands and feet” to the disciples as proof that he isn’t a “spirit” or ghost. John uses Thomas to linger over the contours of the resurrected body. Thomas was evidently missing at the earlier appearance and famously declares, according to the NRSV translation, “Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe” (John 20:25). The ambiguity of the language yields a variety of possible interpretations. What do the “marks of the nails” look like? The dominant interpretation of this scene is one in which Jesus is still openly wounded and Thomas demands to insert his finger into Jesus’s hand and side. That idea is reinforced by crucifixes and sculpture that highlight the wounds that Jesus received during the crucifixion. The rich legacy of medieval artwork has led us to believe that we can see through the holes in Jesus’s hands but the phrase “marks of the nails” is much more ambiguous and peculiar than that.
In my new book, Divine Bodies: Resurrecting Perfection in the New Testament and Early Christianity , I investigate what the Bible actually says about the resurrected body of Jesus. Reading this passage in John it’s clear that Thomas expects to touch the body of Jesus and see if it yields to his hand (although we never find out if he actually does), but nothing about the Greek text here insists that his touch will be penetrative rather than probative. Grammatically, it is equally acceptable to see Thomas as desiring to place his fingers on Jesus’ body rather than—more suggestively—in it. The Greek word for marks – “ typoi ” – doesn’t mean wound. It refers to a mold or shape on which other things were modeled and can also refer to the effect of a blow or pressure. The word was sometimes used to describe the impressions of images that imprinted themselves on the eye in the act of seeing, but it was commonly used to describe the impression left by a horse’s foot, the uneven surface produced by the stamping of seals, the indentations produced in engraving, and the mint marks made by the process of striking coins. In other words, “marks” could be either outlines to be copied or deep impressions left by the application of pressure. Where “marks” are the result of pressure, they are uneven impressions on an otherwise smooth surface. This would seem to be a good description of a scar or a scab: the bump you encounter as you move your finger over otherwise smooth skin. There’s even a passage in the writings of the first-century Jewish philosopher Philo in which he uses the word to refer to a scar (Laws 1.103).
To my knowledge there are actually no instances in which it is used to describe a “through and through” puncture. When Thomas says he wants to place his finger into the marks of the nails, he might actually mean that he wants to place his finger on or in the creases of a healing or scarred wound, rather than into open holes. Interestingly, if we look at ancient medical writers, it’s clear that they also think that bodies start to—forgive me—scab over after several days. The way we have imagined this scene is mistaken.
Why does it matter if he is bleeding or scarred? Well, scars communicate something important about the very nature of Jesus’s resurrected body. Some scholars, like Bishop N. T. Wright , claim that the presence of wounds and the tangible physicality of Jesus’s body demonstrate that he is a live person and not a kind of ghost. And that, moreover, he is the first person to be permanently resurrected in human history. The problem is, as Professor Gregory Riley has written in Resurrection Reconsidered , this isn’t strictly speaking true. To be sure, there are kinds of ghosts—like that of Odysseus’s mother in Homer’s Odyssey—whose soul or “psyche” slips through his hands “like vapor,” but there were other kinds of supernatural entities who could easily be touched. In fact, they might even like it. It’s not fatuous to suggest that Jesus was a zombie; reanimated corpses were a common phenomenon in the ancient world. In a book of fantastical stories by the second-century writer Phlegon, we learn about a young girl named Philinnion who emerges at night from her family tomb in order to liaise with a male house guest. During her periods of reanimation, which last anywhere from minutes to days, she eats, drinks, and has sexual intercourse. Just as we would not suggest that the Night King resurrects people so much as reanimates corpses, we wouldn’t say that Philinnion is actually alive. Intangibility might be a proof of ghostliness, but the ability to touch a person is no assurance that he or she is actually alive.
In the same way, having wounds doesn’t necessarily prove that Jesus is alive either. A number of ghosts or “shades” of the dead preserve the marks of their death in their form. In the Aeneid, for example, Virgil describes Dido’s wounds as “still fresh” in the underworld. Just because a dead person appears to you and seems to be bleeding doesn’t automatically mean that they have been resurrected from the dead.
This is where the “marks” on Jesus’ body become important. Wound healing is not possible in corpses, even ambulatory ones. They knew this even in the Roman world: the second-century Roman doctor Galen is clear that blood does not flow without heat and that both are required for new flesh to be supplied to serious wounds like these. Nor do physically touchable zombies and ethereal shades exhibit signs of healing in the afterlife. As a rebuttal to the potential anti-resurrection objection that what the disciples saw was a mere apparition, not a truly resurrected body, the presence of visible wounds is not, and would not have been, particularly convincing. By contrast, the scarring of Jesus’s body proves, in ways that having open wounds does not, that the very same Jesus that was crucified is now actually alive.
Now of course none of this means that the resurrection actually happened: that’s a question of individual belief. But one thing is for sure: long before zombies became a phenomenon in pop culture, the Evangelists were forcefully arguing that Jesus wasn’t one. Unfortunately, the history of translation and interpretation has hidden their meaning.

Trump’s Right About One Thing: There’s a Double Standard for Him,www.thedailybeast.com,Lawrence Robbins,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-right-about-one-thing-theres-a-double-standard-for-him,"‘FAVORITE PRESIDENT’ Trump’s Right About One Thing: There’s a Double Standard for Him In the name of the president’s supposedly “sincere belief,” all manner of plainly obstructive conduct was exonerated by his attorney general. opinion Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Photos from Getty
For two years now, President Trump has promoted the narrative that he has been singled out for persecution by the special counsel and by his political opponents. The Mueller probe, he has vented, is a form of “Presidential Harassment,” a “Witch Hunt” aimed at unseating “your favorite President.” In the president’s apparent view, no other person—and certainly no other president—would have been treated so harshly.
In the wake of the Mueller Report, and Trump’s exoneration by Attorney General Barr, it is now clear that the truth is exactly the opposite: No other person—and no other president—could have escaped prosecution for obstruction of justice, or at least impeachment, on facts like these.
Let’s start with what separates Donald J. Trump from almost everyone else: He is the president. For Bob Mueller, Trump’s status as president gave Trump a double leg-up: First, under Department of Justice guidance, Mueller could not indict the president so long as he remains in office. To that extent, of course, Trump was treated like any other sitting president elected since the issuance of the original Office of Legal Counsel memo. But Mueller took that immunity a critical (and, in my view, mistaken) step further: He reasoned that, because the president could not be indicted , it would be unfair even to reach a judgment about whether Trump had committed obstruction. As a result, Mueller declined to make a formal obstruction finding and instead handed the case off to Attorney General Barr.
Barr, of course, had auditioned for his current job by writing a memo contending that the entire suite of offenses identified by Mueller could never constitute obstruction, given the scope of the president’s Article II powers. Barr has also contended that the absence of an underlying offense—here, the failure to find that Trump actually “colluded” with the Russians in destabilizing the 2016 election—is an important reason to reject any obstruction charge.
(That proposition, by the way, would be news to at least two of my former clients—Scooter Libby and David Safavian, both high-ranking officials in Republican Administrations. Both were indicted for obstruction; neither of them was ever alleged, or could have been alleged, to have committed some underlying offense.)
Barr, who acknowledged in his press conference (though not in his four-page letter) that he had not relied “solely” on his legal views in making his decision, unsurprisingly dismissed any possible obstruction within 48 hours of receiving the 400-page report.
So it’s nice to be president. But Donald J. Trump is not just any president. He’s also a president whose attorney general was, by his own admission, prepared to discount the wealth of evidence of palpably obstructive conduct found by Mueller on the ground that Trump was “angry” and acted as he did in the “sincere belief” that he was the “unprecedented” victim of illegitimate accusations of wrongdoing.
Can you imagine Attorney General Reno making the same claim for President Clinton, regarding his false testimony during the Paula Jones deposition (on which Kenneth Starr predicated an impeachment recommendation)? Can you imagine Reno rejecting any perjury or obstruction charges by taking a page from Barr’s playbook:
“In assessing the President’s testimony, it is important to bear in mind the context. President Clinton faced an unprecedented situation. Opposing counsel in the Jones deposition was inquiring into the most intimate details of Mr. Clinton’s personal life about which few, if any, of us would wish to be questioned, much less under oath. The President was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that these questions were undermining his presidency.”
Yet in the name of Trump’s supposedly “sincere belief,” all manner of plainly obstructive conduct was exonerated by Attorney General Barr.
Or how about President Nixon’s obstructive conduct in Watergate? Can you imagine Attorney General Mitchell or Attorney General Kleindienst defending the president’s conduct by arguing that Nixon “sincerely believed” that his enemies were out to get him? Or arguing that, because there was no evidence that the president planned the underlying Watergate break-in, Nixon could not be lawfully charged with obstructing the investigation of that event? (Actually, one can imagine Mitchell and Kleindienst making those arguments, which is hardly a ringing endorsement of Barr’s defense of Trump).
Despite Mr. Trump’s protestations of wrongful persecution, the fact of the matter is this: On the facts found in Volume II of the Mueller Report, any other president would now be facing impeachment, and any non-president would be fitted for an orange jumpsuit. READ THIS LIST"
Why Kim Jong Un Hates Mike Pompeo—But Loves Trump,www.thedailybeast.com,Donald Kirk,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-north-koreas-kim-jong-un-hates-mike-pompeobut-loves-trump,"HAWK HUNTING Why Kim Jong Un Hates Mike Pompeo—But Loves Trump North Korea is blustering that it won't return to talks with Trump if the Secretary of State is at the table. But is it all just a ruse to up the stakes? 04.19.19 10:37 PM ET The White House via Getty
North Korea is making Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the bad guy in a sputtering diplomatic process that’s obviously not working.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at this stage seems to harbor more disdain and distrust for Pompeo, if that is possible, than he does for National Security Adviser John Bolton . Yes, Kim hosted Pompeo at a lavish luncheon in Pyongyang as recently as last October, but the seeming goodwill all went wrong when Pompeo sat beside President Donald Trump at the summit with Kim in February and Trump told Kim, in effect, much though I love you, this conversation is going nowhere.
Humiliated by Trump’s sudden walkout from the meeting in the historic Metropole Hotel in Hanoi, Kim appears to be holding Pompeo, not Bolton, personally responsible for the debacle.
That’s why Kwon Jong Gun, director-general for American affairs at the North’s foreign ministry, made clear that Kim and Trump would damn well not meet again if Pompeo were anywhere in the vicinity. Considering that his words were carried in English by Pyongyang’s Korean Central News Agency, he clearly was speaking at Kim’s behest when he said he was “afraid, if Pompeo engages in the talks again, the table will be lousy once again and the talks will become entangled.”
Even if talks with the U.S. resume, said Kwon, “I wish our dialogue counterpart would be not Pompeo but (an)other person who is more careful and mature in communicating with us.”
The State Department very properly and primly did say the U.S. “remains ready to engage North Korea in a constructive manner.” It would seem, however, the U.S. and North Korea are inexorably returning to square one, the state of play before the first Trump-Kim summit in Singapore last June when the two signed off on a meaningless statement promising “denuclearization” of the Korean peninsula, with no hint of when or how.
If there’s one thing nobody expects Kim to do, that’s to give up his nukes and the missiles for carrying them to distant targets. It was to demonstrate he might just return to testing missiles, maybe nukes too, that Kim made a show of witnessing the test of what was described as a new tactical weapon this week. The weapon was not quite a missile, but the North’s media machine called the test “an event of very weighty significance.”
And Kim, whose highest title is “chairman” of the state affairs commission, also was identified in the state media as “supreme commander” of the armed forces. Though “chairman” would suggest power enough, the added military title was designed to convince everyone the North might just go on the warpath again with nukes and missiles, last tested in late 2017.
In fact, Kim in a speech last week “left no doubt as to his intentions of reinforcing his nuclear posture,” says Lee Sung-yoon, North Korea expert at Tufts University’s Fletcher School. As evidence, Lee quotes Kim saying the U.S. “has grown fearful of the threats posed by our rapidly-developing ‘nuclear’ armed force” and “we must frustrate the hostile forces' sanctions on the strength of self-sufficiency”—a reference to economic growth as well as military power.
As for “vilifying Pompeo,” says Lee, that’s “a ruse, a deflective deception to make the real point,” that the U.S. must “get rid of the root cause that pushed us into a nuclear state and obstacles on the way to denuclearization by its own hands.”
In other words, Lee says, Kim still insists on “dislodgement of the U.S. extended nuclear deterrence,” i.e. “eviction” of U.S. forces from Korea and Japan “and removal of nuclear strategic assets from Guam and Hawaii.” As for blackballing Pompeo as a negotiating partner, Lee says that’s just another instance of “raising the stakes, playing hard to get”—all in “the North Korean playbook.” “North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at this stage seems to harbor more disdain and distrust for Pompeo, if that is possible, than he does for National Security Adviser John Bolton.”
To Evans Revere, a former senior diplomat at the U.S. embassy in Seoul, “the idea of North Korea dictating to the United States who should lead its negotiating team is, of course, ridiculous and insulting” —a reflection of “Pyongyang's desire to keep those members of the U.S team who are very firm about denuclearization as far out of the game as possible.” It was, he says, “no accident that the North Koreans in Hanoi only wanted to talk to Trump, whom they see as a softer target than his advisers when it comes to a deal.”
Revere harks back to Pompeo's relations with the North Koreans. They’ve been “fraying since at least the time of his ill-fated visit to Pyongyang in July 2018,” says Revere, when the North Koreans accused him of making “gangster-like’ demands” and Kim refused to meet him.
Although Pompeo did see Kim on his fourth visit to Pyongyang in October, Revere says the North Koreans “have not forgiven him” for having made “some specific and tough demands” for denuclearization. Nor is Pompeo “a fan” of Kim Yong Chol, the vice chairman (under Chairman Kim) of the ruling Workers’ Party and a member of the state commission.
“Pompeo's prickly ties with Kim Yong Chol are widely known,” says Revere. Indeed, Pompeo before the Hanoi summit wanted to see him “to resolve the major differences that existed between the two working-level negotiating teams and the North Koreans refused.” Naturally, when Trump at the summit demanded that Kim “agree to the U.S. definition of denuclearization and also take major steps to denuclearize,” the North Koreans remembered that Pompeo had made the same demand back in July. “The North Koreans in Hanoi only wanted to talk to Trump, whom they see as a softer target than his advisers when it comes to a deal.”
Trump has said he would be glad to see Kim for yet another summit, but the North Koreans may not go for it without a guarantee in advance of the deal they want—beginning with relaxation of sanctions. At his recent summit in Washington with South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in, Trump did say “I enjoy being with the chairman and it really is productive.”
Those words were no doubt welcome by Moon, who’s been pressing hard for reconciliation and dialogue while pressing for his own fourth summit with Kim. Trump played to Moon’s ego, saying he’s “been fighting this battle a long time,” has done “an excellent job” and is “a great ally” but the bottom line remained the same as at Hanoi.
“I think that sanctions now are right now in a level that is fair, and I really believe something significant is going to happen,” Trump told the assembled media. Sure, “various smaller deals” might happen, including sanctions relief, but “we’re talking about the big deal”—“and the big deal is we have to get rid of the nuclear weapons.”
For North Korea, clearly the key to getting Trump to go for a step-by-step process, in which denuclearization would never happen, is first to get rid of Pompeo. READ THIS LIST"
There’s a Gender Gap in the Legal Marijuana Movement,www.thedailybeast.com,The Conversation,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-marijuana-legalization-movement-has-a-gender-gap-problem,"There’s a Gender Gap in the Legal Marijuana Movement Where are the women of weed? 04.19.19 10:37 PM ET Getty
Surveys show that on issue after issue , women are more liberal than men, save for one: Men are more likely than women to support the legalization of marijuana.
Americans are becoming more supportive of marijuana legalization each year but the gender gap remains a constant: While 68 percent of men now support marijuana legalization, only 56 percent of women do.
What’s behind this gender gap?
We suspected mothers might be a key driver. In our book “ The Politics of Parenthood ,” we were able to show that mothers support policies that help children, whether it’s subsidized health care or public assistance for needy kids. So we naturally assumed that mothers – out of concern for children’s health – were driving the gender divide on the issue.
We were wrong. Parenthood is political
Becoming a parent and raising a child is a profound life-altering experience. It changes how you spend your time, the way you think about your finances, whom you socialize with, and what you worry about.
But until recently, political scientists had ignored the ways being a parent might shape political attitudes.
In previous research , we drew from a range of national data sets to show that parenthood is, indeed, political. We showed that parents have distinct views on a range of policies, from government spending on education and child care, to the role the government should play in helping others.
Dads today are more likely to take on child care duties than in the past. But we found that parenthood remains a highly gendered experience. Mothers still spend more time parenting than men. Mothers also engage in more of the day-to-day work of parenting such as scheduling play dates and making doctor appointments.
Given the greater amount of time women spend caring for and worrying about their children, it’s perhaps not surprising that women’s political views are more affected than men’s by the experience of being a parent.
Across time and across demographic groups, motherhood consistently pushes women to embrace more liberal views on the role of government, which they see as a source of support for their kids. Testing the Motherhood Hypothesis
All of this previous research fortified our belief that motherhood would be a major driver behind the gender gap on marijuana legalization. After all, so many of the anti-drug messages in the media focus on the dangers drugs hold for children.
It makes sense that mothers – worried about the safety of their children – might not want a mind altering drug to become freely available. Some earlier research even hinted that this might be the case.
To put our motherhood hypothesis to the test, we drew on a distinctive data set from the Pew Research Center that included a series of questions on attitudes towards marijuana, including self-reported marijuana usage.
Unexpectedly, we discovered that mothers and fathers were no more likely to oppose marijuana legalization than women and men without kids. The Real Drivers of the Divide
So if a lack of support among women for legalization has nothing to do with motherhood, what’s behind their tepid support?
We identified three key drivers.
First, women are more likely to be religious than men. Earlier work has found that, unsurprisingly, religious people are more disapproving of marijuana use and less likely to try drugs .
Second, men have a higher tolerance for risk than women. Legalizing marijuana involves some risks to society, and it appears that men are more comfortable with these risks than women.
But what best explains the gender gap in support is the gender gap in marijuana use. Men simply use marijuana more than women, and this seems to make them more likely to support legalization.
We were curious about which other demographic and political factors might predict marijuana use and support for legalization. Some results were surprising, while others weren’t.
Married people and older people were less likely to report using marijuana – no surprise there. But we found that despite Republicans’ lower level of support for marijuana legalization, Republicans were just as likely as Democrats to report using marijuana.
The other surprise was that mothers and fathers who had children 18 or younger in the home were just as likely to report using marijuana as non-parents.
The fact that mothers use marijuana as much as other women certainly helps explain why there’s no motherhood gap for marijuana attitudes. When it comes to marijuana, the perception that mothers are distinctively moral – or make more wholesome choices than the rest of society in order to protect their children – isn’t really supported by the data.

Is Glitter Beer Actually Beer?,www.thedailybeast.com,Lew Bryson,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-glitter-beer-actually-beer,"EXTREME BEER Is Glitter Beer Actually Beer? From brisket- and donut- to pickle-flavored beer, we explore the farthest reaches of brewing and try to answer the age-old question of what is and what is not beer. 04.19.19 10:35 PM ET
I remember where I was the first time I heard someone say “that’s not even beer.”
I was in an elevator in a Denver hotel on my way to the Great American Beer Festival, and a guy standing next to me, a beer judge according to his dangling ID, looked like his best friend had just died.
“What’s the matter?” someone else asked him.
“I’m judging malt liquor all morning,” he admitted with a look of deep regret.
“What? That’s not even beer!” the questioner spat out with disbelief.
That was more than 20 years ago, and it still strikes me as a funny exchange. Probably even funnier now, because there are beers being made, and sold, and consumed with gusto, that make malt liquor look downright traditional.
What is beer, then? It has to be fermented from grain—and not distilled—but once you get past that, you get more like...guidelines.
Beer does not have to have hops, despite some laws to the contrary. (For one, gruit uses a blend of other botanicals, and it’s definitely beer.) Beer doesn’t have to be carbonated, it doesn’t have to be boiled, it doesn’t have to be filtered, or chilled, or aged, or bottled.
Stripped down to the very basics, a bowl of thin gruel that fermented would be beer. Building up from there, you can really add almost anything to the mix and use a range of production methods. The beers we’re used to drinking—like pilsner and other light lager, stout, IPA and pale ale—have occupied a fairly narrow range over the past 50 years, one that has only recently begun to broaden significantly.
So let’s have a look at what beer is, and can be.
We all know the familiar beers: central European lagers, British ales, Irish stouts, Belgian ales of various types, and, yes, American light beers and the denigrated and debased malt liquor. You may know some of the traditional beers on the fringes of what’s “normal,” like the spontaneously fermented lambics of Belgium, those gruits I mentioned earlier, various fruit beers and sour beers.
But it goes a long, long way further out than that if you explore the most remote extremes of what’s called “beer.” Dip your attention into the Reddit streams and Facebook groups that discuss beer on the cutting edge, and the extreme homebrewing groups. It’s really kind of crazy out there.
Start with something familiar: IPA. A new sub-category pops up every eight months or so. Sour IPAs and IPAs with a rainbow of added fruit have joined the standard IPA, double IPA, and session IPA. Is IPA too bitter for you? Try the New England IPA, which is hazy, aromatic, and full of hop flavor but without the bitterness, or a brut IPA, bracingly dry from a full fermentation. There are even “Zero-IBU” IPAs, brewed so that they come in at zero when measured for International Bittering Units, despite having pounds and pounds of hops in every barrel. If IPA is too menacing, why not try a milkshake IPA with added lactose, or a pie IPA with yummy fruit?
But that’s just getting started! There are pastry stouts, with flavors like coconut, chocolate, oatmeal, figs, and caramel. There is a full range of coffee beers, from eye-opener espressos to sweet-and-spiced Vietnamese coffee brews. I had a horchata beer that sure did remind me of almonds and sweet rice, with cinnamon.
There are revivals of largely extinct beer types, twists on classics, and juxtapositions of unlikely ingredients. A couple of weeks ago, someone sent me an actual tap list from Denver that had so many unusual options that it sounded like the basis of a Portlandia skit. The place was serving an open-fermented “Norwegian raw ale,” a Czech pilsner brewed with unadjusted Denver tap water (Okay, not that scary), almond milk stout aged on Thin Mints, and a coconut milkshake IPA aged on dragon fruit, vanilla, and coconut milk.
Those last two verge on what I think of as “stunt beer,” like beers made with donuts, or Peeps. There’s a whole sub-category of beers made with additions of breakfast cereals, like Lucky Charms and Fruity Pebbles. I have to put glitter beer in here as well, brewed with a big dose of food grade glitter, so it looks like My Little Pony’s Beer.
There’s also a range of gose beers, and gose is weird enough on its own. Gose is a relic from Leipzig, Germany, a tart wheat beer made with coriander (or cilantro) and salt. Gose almost died out in 1945, was revived and then almost died out again in 1966, but apparently someone forgot to put the stake back in its heart, and it revived. I don’t get the demand for a sour beer with coriander and salt. Maybe it isn’t to drink? Dogfish Head just released a Super Eight Super Gose that you can use to develop film. Not kidding, they worked on it with help from Kodak.
Gose’s natural character made it easy to add things to it, because it was crying out for a better flavor. (Okay, yes, that’s my personal prejudice speaking; gose is perhaps the only style of beer I just don’t care for.) So you can now find gose with the following added flavorings: cherry, cucumber, melon, blood orange (there are a lot of blood orange beers out there right now), hibiscus, key lime, mango, guava, passionfruit, peach, blackberry, raspberry, cranberry, spruce, agave, pineapple, plum...There are more, a lot more. You get the idea.
Want a cocktail? Why not have a beer that tastes like one instead? No, I don’t know why you’d want that either, though I did find it hard to resist a Negroni-inspired beer that was served in a quart jug, called a “Negrowler.” Get a pint of Old-Fashioned (beer), Mojito (beer), Paloma (beer), Long Island Iced Tea (beer), or Sex on the Beach (beer), you knew it was coming.
I could go on and on, just with crazy ingredients—I saw a dill pickle lager this morning—but let’s wind this part up with a quick nod to the beers made with meat. Yes, meat, because there are beers made with brisket, and bull testicles, and an Icelandic beer that is made with whale testicles...that are smoked over a sheep dung fire. Check the date: it is not April 1. Dung-smoked whale testicle beer.
I’ll try any one of these. And in fact, I have tried quite a few of them already. It’s my job, after all. But these are the beers that get some people shouting, “that’s not even beer!” As a result, there are frequent calls for “beer-flavored beer” (there are even a few beers named that), a good old-fashioned beer, like dad used to make.
But when people say that, they mean a fairly narrow range that doesn’t include a lot of historic types of beer. After all, gose is a traditional beer, but hardly anyone in America had ever heard of it until about fifteen years ago. Go further back to the early years of beer, and let me know what you think of Mumme, made with wheat malt, oats and beans, spiked with fir bark and tips, handfuls of seeds and herbs, “bruised bayberries,” and whole eggs. All of that was brewed and then bunged into a barrel for two full years. Mmmm, boy! Beer-flavored beer!
It seems like every generation faces a beer that some say “isn’t beer.” The first batch of Guinness Stout made with raw roasted barley seems likely to have faced resistance. Japanese brewers met a stiff increase in malt taxes by brewing low-malt beers, happoshu (“sparkling wine”). When the government responded by taxing happoshu , the brewers made daisan no biru (“the third beer”), with little or no malt at all.
There were a whole set of über-beers, starting with the well-established German EKU 28 and the Swiss Samichlaus, both lagers that pushed north of 12 percent alcohol by volume. Samuel Adams laid a path upwards with Triple Bock, Millennium, and then Utopias, topping out around 28 percent. BrewDog responded with Tokyo* (18 percent), Tactical Nuclear Penguin (32 percent) and Sink the Bismarck! (41 percent), the last two done with the assistance of freezing to concentrate the alcohol. Some people reacted badly. “That can’t be beer, it’s too strong!” Poppycock. And please hand me another, I can still feel my lips.
I’d love to use my years of beery experience to make a ruling, saying this is beer, but this is not because it’s just a joke. People who heard I was writing this story asked me to “lay down the law,” but...it’s not that way.
If it’s fermented from grain, it’s more than likely beer. Anything else you do to it, with the exception of distillation, isn’t going to change that. If it’s good, people will drink it. If it’s good enough, they’ll drink it more than once. I don’t have to like it for it to be beer; neither do you.
That said, I’m likely going to have a nice cold, crisp pilsner with lunch. It tastes like beer. READ THIS LIST"
"Forget Roy Cohn, Future Presidents Would Ask ‘Where’s My Bill Barr?’",www.thedailybeast.com,Barbara McQuade,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/forget-roy-cohn-future-presidents-would-ask-wheres-my-william-barr,"Jonathan Ernst/Reuters
He lost me at “no collusion.”
I have been withholding judgment on Attorney General William Barr , believing that someone who has previously served in the Department of Justice as he did would respect the institution and the rule of law. His conduct before and after his confirmation had provided some reason to question his motives, but I still held out hope that he would lead honorably in handling the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
Barr confirmed my worst suspicions when he stood at the podium to discuss the release of Mueller’s report into Russian election interference. Instead of using the language of a prosecutor, Barr parroted President Donald Trump’s favorite talking point of “no collusion” four times. And it got worse from there.
Mueller’s report specifically stated that he was not using the term “collusion” because “collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability” nor a “term of art” used in federal law. Instead, Mueller stated that his team analyzed the facts under the law of conspiracy. For Barr to repeatedly use the term “collusion” when Mueller deliberately avoided it gave the appearance that Barr had coordinated his message with the White House. Barr seemed more like a defense attorney for Trump than the lawyer for the people. “A motive of frustration or anger does not excuse obstruction of justice.”
Moreover, during his remarks, Barr diverged from the language of the report in other ways. The report stated that “the investigation did not establish” conspiracy. Instead, Barr said that the special counsel “found no evidence” that any American participated in the conspiracy to interfere with the election. These are two very different things. In fact, Mueller seemed to anticipate that some might misread his findings, including in his report the following language: “A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those facts.” He likely did not expect the person to misconstrue his findings would be the attorney general of the United States.
Barr then went on.
“In assessing the President’s actions discussed in the report, it is important to bear in mind the context. President Trump faced an unprecedented situation. As he entered into office, and sought to perform his responsibilities as President, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office, and the conduct of some of his associates. At the same time, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the President’s personal culpability. Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion. And as the Special Counsel’s report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the President was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks.”
A motive of frustration or anger does not excuse obstruction of justice. In fact, most defendants who commit obstruction of justice experience frustration and anger. These motives are not exonerating, and Barr’s reference to them sounds like the kinds of excuses you might hear from a lawyer representing the accused.
Perhaps the most egregious remark that Barr made during the press conference made was when he said that the White House “fully cooperated” in the investigation. Barr made this statement despite the fact that Trump refused to participate in an interview with Mueller, something Mueller’s team sought for a year. Mueller’s report noted the problems that resulted from allowing Trump to respond to written questions, responding more than 30 times that he did not recall the answer. Trump’s failure to sit for an interview prevented Mueller’s team from asking follow-up questions or attempting to refresh his recollection with documents.
Mueller gave up on the idea of an interview because he believed that Trump would resort to “lengthy constitutional litigation” that would unduly delay the investigation. The report also shows that in addition to refusing to participate in an interview, Trump engaged in obstructive behavior throughout the investigation, attempting to fire Mueller, editing a press release in a misleading way, directing White House Counsel Don McGahn to lie, and seven other episodes of obstructive behavior. That hardly sounds like full cooperation.
If Barr’s language is not enough to tarnish his legacy, then his conduct certainly is. Barr’s March 24 letter to Congress stated that Mueller’s inability to decide the obstruction of justice issue “leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.” We learned yesterday that the report contains no indication that Mueller intended for Barr to decide the obstruction issue.
Mueller stated that he followed the DOJ opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted, and so “fairness counseled against concluding that President Trump committed crimes because he could not avail himself of the normal adversary process for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator.”
In other words, Mueller was refraining from recommending charges against Trump because he is the president, not for lack of evidence. Mueller further stated that he decided to “preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary materials were available,” suggesting that he was leaving the decision to pursue charges to Congress or to prosecutors in a time when Trump is no longer president. By substituting his view for that of the special counsel, Barr circumvented the very purpose for having a special counsel, to insulate the decision-maker from conflicts of interest that exist for those in the executive branch chain of command.
We had a warning about Barr last summer, before he was attorney general, when he submitted an unsolicited 19-page memo to the Justice Department arguing that a president cannot obstruct justice as a matter of law when he is exercising executive power. Mueller and his team rejected that position in their report, but as attorney general, Barr gets the last word.
When former Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, Trump was angry that he did not have a protector. He asked then, “where’s my Roy Cohn,” a mob lawyer who used aggressive and legally questionable tactics to help his clients prevail.
For future presidents, the question may be “where’s my Bill Barr?” READ THIS LIST"
Gov’t Wants 18-Month Sentence for Russian Agent Maria Butina,www.thedailybeast.com,Tracy.Connor@thedailybeast.com (Tracy Connor),04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/maria-butina-doj-pushes-for-18-month-prison-term-in-case-of-russian-agent-as-her-lawyers-argue-for-time-served,"DUELING MEMOS Gov’t Wants 18-Month Sentence for Russian Agent Maria Butina In memos filed Friday night, the government and defense attorneys presented dueling sketches of the gun-slinging Russian who cozied up to powerful American conservatives. Tracy Connor 04.19.19 10:24 PM ET
Federal prosecutors are asking a judge to give Russian agent Maria Butina 18 months in prison while her lawyers are pushing for a sentence of time-served so she can return to her homeland and “start her life anew.”
In sentencing memos filed Friday night, the government and defense attorneys presented dueling sketches of the gun-slinging, flame-haired Russian who cozied up to powerful American conservatives .
She pleaded guilty in December to conspiring to violate laws prohibiting covert foreign agents and promised to cooperate with American law enforcement. She is scheduled to be sentenced April 26.
Prosecutors described her as a politically-savvy schemer who sought to advance Russian interests and establish a back channel between Moscow and influential figures in Washington.
“Butina was not a spy in the traditional sense of trying to gain access to classified information to send back to her home country. She was not a trained intelligence officer,” they wrote.
“But the actions she took were nonetheless taken on behalf of the Russian Official for the benefit of the Russian Federation, and those actions had the potential to damage the national security of the United States.”
Her lawyers, by contrast, portrayed her as a naive country girl who came to the United States for love and opportunity and made a bureaucratic mistake—failing to register as a foreign agent while she reported back to a former Russian official, Alexander Torshin, about her activities.
They described how she started and built a gun-rights organization, made contact with the National Rifle Association, started a romance with Republican operative Paul Erickson, and then moved to the U.S., where she admittedly did Torshin’s bidding.
“If given a chance, she would have done things differently,” her attorneys wrote.
But, they added, “all told, her motivations weren’t nefarious. Maria was genuinely interested in improving relations between the two countries, and she had no ill intent.
“Additionally, if Torshin happened to share any of her unsolicited notes or political thoughts up the chain, she didn’t know, although she would welcome any recognition all the same.”
The attorneys said that Butina has fully cooperated with the U.S. investigation, turning over thousands of documents to a Senate committee, answering the committee’s questions for eight hours, and sitting for interviews with federal investigators before and after her guilty plea.
They asked the judge to give her a sentence of no more than six months; since she’s been jailed for nine months, that would amount to a sentence of time served—along with a one-way ticket to Russia.
Prosecutors acknowledged Butina’s cooperation and said they were willing to cut her a break, asking for a six-month downward departure in the sentence. Instead of the 24 months called for in the guidelines, they argued, she should get 18 months.
“Butina’s work involved building a rolodex of and information about powerful people who had, or were likely to get, access to and influence over the next presidential administration,” the U.S. attorney’s office wrote.
“Butina’s reports back to the Russian Official on the people she was meeting have all the hallmarks of spotting-and-assessing reports. The value of this information to the Russian Federation is immense.”
Butina’s memo included a sheaf of character references including one from George O’Neill, the Rockefeller heir and conservative writer who reportedly hosted a U.S.-Russian “friendship dinner” at her behest in 2017.
He called her a “delightful and idealistic young soul” and suggested that her efforts at diplomacy might not be over.
“I expect with the spiritual strength gained from this painful and unhappy episode in her life, she can continue working to enable peaceful answers to some of her vexing international problems,” he wrote. READ THIS LIST"

The Trump administration is set to reverse more than two decades of U.S. policy in Cuba by allowing lawsuits against foreign companies doing business in property seized from Americans after Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution. An unnamed administration official told the Associated Press about the shift ahead of an expected official announcement Wednesday. The move could make it much more difficult for Cuba to bring in foreign investment and ignite international trade disputes between the U.S. and Europe. Trump reportedly hopes the pressure will help isolate Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro who is holding power with support from countries including Cuba. National security adviser John Bolton is expected to explain the new policy during a speech in Miami Wednesday afternoon, which is home to thousands of exiles and immigrants from Cuba.

Two Florida Teenage Girls Arrested for Plotting Nine Murders,www.thedailybeast.com,Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau),04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/two-14-year-old-florida-teenage-girls-arrested-for-plotting-nine-murders,"AVERTED Two Florida Teenage Girls Arrested for Plotting Nine Murders The 14-year-old girls had made extensive plans to obtain guns and dispose of the bodies of their victims. 04.20.19 10:06 AM ET Getty
Two 14-year-old girls from Avon Park Middle School, about 80 miles south of Orlando, Florida were arrested for intricately plotting to kill nine people, according to local news reports.
The plans included where they would buy firearms, what they would wear and how they planned to burn the bodies to dispose of them. It also included how they intended to “lure” their victims to the location they planned to carry out the killing.
The girls wrote their plans, including the names of six of their victims along with coded abbreviations, on eight pieces of paper found by their teacher in a folder called ‘Project 11/9’ with the words “private info” and “do not open” scrawled on the front, according to the local newspaper The Ledger .
The paper also reports that the girls had plans about how they would pick up the victims in a vehicle, though it is unclear if either of the girls had a valid drivers license or access to a car.
They also reportedly planned to transport the victims’ bodies to a place where they would be burned and buried after the killings, according to the affidavit seen by the local newspaper.
Three of the eight pieces of paper found in the folder reportedly had notes describing the outfits the girls would wear, which included gloves. One note said, “NO NAILS,” and another said, “NO Hair Showing from the moment we put on these clothes we NIGGAS!”
The Ledger also reported that another note made reference to “traphouse in Sebring,” and “5-8 guns.” One note said, “I’m just going to tell them it’s a prank if they call me or if they find it.”
The teacher who turned in the girls said the two suspects were acting “hysterical” while looking for the folder, even going through other students’ backpacks. The teacher then located the missing folder and opened it. She saw a note about guns and immediately reported it to the school security officer.
The Highlands County School Board posted information on their Facebook page to “prevent any incorrect information from circulating.”
‘Two Avon Park Middle School students were arrested after a teacher alerted law enforcement of a possible plan to harm others off campus. All families involved have been contacted. As this is an ongoing investigation, no further details will be released at this time.”
The girls each face nine counts of conspiracy to commit murder and three counts of conspiracy to commit kidnapping. They will be arraigned on Monday."

Coachella Security Guards Allege Inhumane Treatment: ‘People Over Here Are Starving’,www.thedailybeast.com,amy.zimmerman@thedailybeast.com (Amy Zimmerman),04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/coachella-security-guards-allege-inhumane-treatment-people-over-here-are-starving,"Coachella Security Guards Allege Inhumane Treatment: ‘People Over Here Are Starving’ exclusive Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Security guards working the 2019 Coachella music festival open up to The Daily Beast about how they’ve slept in makeshift tents, received meager portions of food, and much more. Amy Zimmerman 04.20.19 2:08 PM ET
E very year, music lovers and miscellaneous basics flood Indio, California, for the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Coachella is known for its huge headlining artists and general aura of douchebaggery—the stereotypical festival-goer is a rich kid sporting a headdress and a fanny pack , scouring the desert for good times and even better Instagram opportunities.
Of course, these highly mocked caricatures only make up part of the story. The festival is also populated with an army of staffers who aren’t in Indio to party. This contingent includes security guards who work long days in high heat confiscating contraband, protecting talent, and generally attempting to ensure that everyone survives the weekend. It’s an important job, and an appealing one for fans and entertainment world-adjacent security professionals.
Antonio Cannady, a screenwriter based in Los Angeles, told The Daily Beast that he heard about a company based in Long Beach that was hiring security for Coachella. “So I went down there and applied and then we had this little quick orientation. It wasn’t much of an interview, it was like a cattle call, ‘cause we go inside this room and everybody’s standing up. It’s hot, we’re all sweating. But they talked it up like it’s Coachella, this big music festival. And they were like, yeah, it’s going to be like camping, so bring a tent and a sleeping bag or whatever.”
Cannady, who sent The Daily Beast a written account of his experience at Coachella, wrote, “Fast-forward a few weeks later and I’m at the BMW Nationwide Security loading into a bus with about thirty-five people, all people of color.” After a four-hour bus ride, his report continued, “We all unloaded with our luggage and checked in with reps for the Staff Pro, one of the main security companies contracted by Goldenvoice [a subsidiary of AEG ]… who provided us with a one-page document; basically, giving us instructions on how not to die from heat stroke.”
The Daily Beast reviewed a photo of Cannady’s Coachella badge, which lists both Staff Pro and BMW. He told The Daily Beast that, “What Staff Pro has done is provided the grounds for their subcontracted companies. When we clock in, it’s all done through Staff Pro. We wear Staff Pro uniforms. We wear Staff Pro creds. They pay BMW and BMW pays us.”
When reached for comment Allied Universal, the parent company of Staff Pro, initially told The Daily Beast that Staff Pro does not subcontract out to private security companies for Coachella. However, they later reversed their position, writing in an email that, “All our Staff Pro/Allied Universal security professionals (including the security staff who are subcontracted) are offered the same resources.”
In a written statement, Allied Universal elaborated on these alleged resources, saying, “The Staff Pro security professionals hired for the Coachella event are offered the resources needed in order to make sure that we uphold the highest standards in working conditions for each and every employee. Located on a grassy field area at the event, we offer a camp ground that includes seating, picnic tables, charging stations as well as shower facilities. In addition, each security professional is provided pallets of water and catered food. For those security professionals who work the night shift, we offer a large air-conditioned tent that is blacked out from the sun so they can sleep during the day.”
While Cannady certainly wasn’t expecting luxurious accommodations, he was taken aback by the condition of the campground, writing, “We were all ushered into a large, smelly, humid tent floored in grass.” Although BMW Security had advised the security guards to bring a tent, air mattress, and a blanket with them, Cannady explained that, “This was easier said than done, with some security guards obviously stricken with poverty and arriving with pretty much nothing.”
Workers without their own tents slept in a large communal tent. Cannady’s account continued, “A lot of folks arrived destitute and had no choice but to sleep on a ground that felt like you were sleeping on a slab of concrete. I for one was one of those people that slept on the ground the first couple of nights. The next morning my body felt like I was a lineman for the New England Patriots. It ached just that bad. At night, the temperatures dropped into the low-60s, and the moisture moved in saturating the grass that was also your bed. So, those of us without an air mattress or a blanket were forced to use cardboard boxes and aluminum foil as a barrier between themselves and an insect-infested, cold, moist ground.”
He added, “This was a situation that if you could not afford to bring the needed supplies, then you were screwed and for the most part on your own.”
Speaking on the phone with The Daily Beast from Coachella, Cannady explained that, “People over here are starving, losing weight because we’re not being fed properly. It’s just a lot of messed up stuff that’s going on.”
A security guard with another company, who asked to be referred to by his nickname, Chowderr, confirmed in a conversation with The Daily Beast that it was not uncommon for workers to complain of being underfed and hungry: “If you’re not coming stockpiled and prepared, you’re going to be hurting for maybe a couple of days at a time.” The Daily Beast reviewed a photo of Chowderr’s 2019 Coachella security badge, which labels him as a Staff Pro employee, and also lists the smaller security company that hired him. The Daily Beast also reviewed an email to Chowderr from that company, Parker Security Services, confirming his employment with them.
Like Cannady, he was advised to bring a sleeping bag and a tent. “So we get here, we set up our tents and whatnot,” he recalled, “It’s about 80-degree weather, really hot. I think my biggest problem is they didn’t really let us know about the wind problems that they have here. When they did let us know, it was already like—people came back from work and their tents were destroyed. A lot of people didn’t know that wind does that to the tents out here. There was no warning, there was really no assistance.” “ We know that people who run this have the money. We’re not asking for five-star treatment or anything like that. It’s just a whole mess. ”
“They don’t supply you with anything—the most that they’ll supply you with is if they kick someone out, they’ll give you their tent. That’s literally it…Besides that, it’s a big lot of non-communication. It could be set up way better. We know that people who run this have the money. We’re not asking for five-star treatment or anything like that. It’s just a whole mess.”
Chowderr compared the food that is provided to security guards to “jail”—“That’s kind of what it’s like, not in the quality of how good it is, but in terms of you literally get one portion off of a 13-hour shift—like, what is this? What is this going to do?” In follow-up texts to The Daily Beast, he elaborated on that “portion,” saying that Staff Pro provides “a scoop or two of whatever it is they have.” Cannady observed that different companies appeared to provide different resources to their staffers. “We were told we would be fed but we were not told what minimum we would be. For example, the company I’m with provided a small bowl of pork and beans yesterday. That was it! So if you didn’t go to work or had your own food, then that’s all you ate.”
He continued: “Multiple meals were provided…sometimes. Hit-or-miss with these companies. Our company provides bag lunches but sometimes they only consist of a can of tuna and/or a single sandwich. Staff Pro is SO inconsistent. If they feed us, it’s a small single serving before we head into the field. This food is gone/burned off halfway through your shift and then you’re stuck.”
In his written account, Cannady emphasized that, “If it wasn’t for BMW providing meals until we got our first paycheck, which was two weeks later, then most of the crew would have been screwed. Sadly, other security guards with other companies were not as lucky.”
Cannady, in his written statement, called on Coachella to “allocate food budgets to properly feed guards for at least two weeks until they receive their first pay checks. Some people arrive destitute, proper meals are essential. This burden should not fall on small subcontracted security companies because all can’t afford to do it.” He told The Daily Beast that he would also urge them to provide aircraft hangars for lodging, complete with cots and blankets, because “no one should be sleeping on that horrid ground in that horrid tent or dealing with sand storms where your tent is blown away.”
Cannady has also alleged a racial divide with regard to working conditions for security personnel. “On my campground there are like three or four companies, all minority-owned by black folks,” he explained. “Now if you go across the field like I showed in the pictures, those are majority-white folks on different campgrounds.”
The photos show a row of buildings, which Cannady labels as “their lot,” juxtaposed with “our lot”: a smattering of tents.
Different security companies also pay different hourly wages, according to employees. Cannady, who was hired by BMW, wrote that, “Those bussed in to work Coachella for the entire month of April are only paid $12 dollars an hour and are required to work 12-16 shifts during the event.” Chowderr said that he is paid $14 an hour, but added, “I don’t understand how we don’t all get paid at least $15 minimum. Some of these posts…When I got here, they said you’re supposed to work thirteen hours, you’ll be in the sun, you cannot sit, you cannot move. And I’m like, well, how do you expect me to just stand here for thirteen hours straight in the sun and not have a chair for me?”
The owner of a private security company, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution from Staff Pro, told The Daily Beast that his company was subcontracted by Staff Pro for Coachella for many years. He said that his company last worked with Staff Pro in 2017, and that “I wouldn’t want to do business with them again.” He recalled a hectic working environment at the festival and a logistical “nightmare,” explaining, “The thing was, sometimes you’d show up with 20, 25 people and they’d send away, you know, 10, 15 people because they’ve already met their numbers. So it’s not always, if you send 25, they’re going to clock in 25. And in my opinion, it’s always been a favoritism game too with [the various subcontracted security companies]…It becomes a vicious toxic environment and I don’t want to do it no more.”
“When it comes to food and water and things like that, they may provide that stuff, but it runs out pretty quickly,” he continued. “Or there may not be enough of it.”
Chowderr told The Daily Beast that he had had difficulty accessing food and other resources, mainly because “Walmart runs” were offered inconsistently. “Some days I didn’t eat. Like one day I did a 16 [hour shift], I did 10 a.m to 2:30 a.m., and then they’re like, okay, we’re going to do a Walmart run in the morning. How can I do Walmart runs in the morning if I’m at work for you guys? Then when I get off, they’re like, no more Walmart runs, but I need to go to Walmart to get supplies and food and something to eat! So that makes it hard.”
He added that Walmart runs appeared to be cancelled during “show days,” noting, “They don’t tell us this by the way, they are just cancelled until the following week, so if you don’t have a car or know anybody with one…Yesterday I walked about 4 miles to Walmart to pick up some things for show day.”
According to Chowderr, “show days” bring in an influx of even more security guards, further aggravating the perceived lack of organization, communication and resources. He specifically referenced the portable showers, saying that they hold five people at a time, while there are “over 300 guards on my lot.” He continued, “When the hot water is gone we have to wait until they refill it with hot water and we don’t even know when that will be. There are lines and sometimes people are late for work or didn’t make it because of the showers.”
“If you don’t respect your guards, and you don’t have these basic things, you’re not doing what you need to as a company to support a big event like this,” Chowderr warned.
When asked what happens when security guards complain, Chowderr claimed, “[They] try to shoo you away, say they’ll get back to you or that it is what it is.” Cannady told The Daily Beast that he has asked other guards why they don’t speak up, and been told that, “We don’t want to get in trouble. We don’t want to get fired.” He added that quitting in protest would present many of the bused-in guards with a new challenge—finding a way back to LA."

"One Woman Nearly Decapitated, Another Slashed While 4-Year-Old Was in House in New York Bloodbath",www.thedailybeast.com,Pervaiz.Shallwani@thedailybeast.com (Pervaiz Shallwani) Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau),04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/one-woman-nearly-decapitated-another-slashed-while-4-year-old-was-in-house-in-new-york-bloodbath,"04.20.19 1:57 PM ET REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton
A 20-year-old woman was brutally murdered—her head nearly-decapitated and her fingers severed—following an attack inside a Brooklyn apartment Saturday, a senior NYPD official told The Daily Beast.
A second woman was critically injured and a 4-year-old girl was found unharmed in a back bedroom of the apartment, the official said.
A person of interest was arrested in connection with the killing Saturday night and was being questioned, NYPD Deputy Chief Michael Kemper said during a press conference. Kemper would not go into details about the suspect, but said that the man is known to both women and police are “confident that we’re not looking for anyone else right now” in connection with the attack.
“We believe this incident was not random,” Kemper said. “We believe the victims knew their assailant.”
A second law enforcement official told The Daily Beast the man is the boyfriend of the woman who survived the attack.
Investigators are working to determine if a bloody axe that was recovered from a nearby dumpster is the weapon used to killthe victim, Savannah Rivera, police said.
The incident took place around 1:30 a.m. inside a housing project in Brooklyn’s increasingly hip Bushwick neighborhood.
According to a preliminary investigation, officers responded to the scene when the second woman escaped the attack, flagged down a taxi cab and asked the driver to take her to a hospital, police said.
The driver, noticing the woman was severely injured and bleeding, called 911. Responding medics took the woman to the hospital because of her condition before officers arrived, the senior law enforcement official said.
On her way to the hospital the woman told medics that there was a dead woman inside the building and that a 4-year-old child was also in the apartment, the official said.
Responding officers and medics found Rivera, unconscious and unresponsive in the living room of an eighth-floor apartment with stab wounds and cuts to her head and body, police said. She was pronounced dead at the scene by responding medics.
Police found the 4-year-old daughter of the injured woman unharmed in a back bedroom of the apartment, police said. She has been taken to an area hospital for observation.
The girl’s mother remains in critical but stable condition with lacerations on her head and body, police said.
Officers at the scene say Rivera was fully clothed in the blood-splattered living room of the apartment, the official said. Police believe she was visiting the 21-year-old woman, who is believed to be a family member or friend, when the attack took place, and does not live in the building.
No arrests have been made, but officers found an axe in the trash compactor of the apartment, the official said. Forensic tests are being done to determine if it is the murder weapon.
Investigators have determined that there is surveillance camera footage in and around the building and are working to secure and analyze the video to determine who may have entered or exited the building, the official said.
The police had previously responded to a dispute between the surviving 21-year-old woman and her mother, the official said, adding that the mother was not home at the time of the murder.

Chris Lilley’s New Netflix Show ‘Lunatics’ Is Painfully Out of Touch,www.thedailybeast.com,Joseph.Longo@thedailybeast.com (Joseph Longo),04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/chris-lilleys-netflix-show-lunatics-no-blackface-but-still-painfully-out-of-touch,"WHAT YEAR IS IT Chris Lilley’s New Netflix Show ‘Lunatics’ Is Painfully Out of Touch The Australian comedian’s new Netflix mockumentary follows six freakish characters, all played by him. But is it funny? 04.20.19 1:25 PM ET Vince Valitutti/Netflix
Lunatics is classic Chris Lilley—for better and worse. I could give you the synopsis—the Australian comedian’s new 10-part mockumentary series on Netflix chronicles the mundane day-to-day lives of six eccentrics, all played by Lilley. They include Becky, a seven-foot-tall twin starting college and Gavin, the vulgar preteen heir to an English estate.
I could tell you about the show’s sweeping production value. Shot like a high-budget Netflix documentary, Lunatics features gorgeous aerial shots of homes and landscapes in Australia ’s Gold Coast. Each setting feels lived in. The home of an ex-adult movie star turned “collector” named Joyce is claustrophobic enough for Hoarders . Likewise, retail veteran Keith, who is physically in love with his cash register, looks like he walked straight out of a Buckle store circa 2002.
I might even praise Lilley’s already impressive acting chops. Forever a character actor, he once again excels at seamlessly making his caricatures feel real. Quentin, an adult fuckboy failing to successfully take over his family’s real estate business, immediately recalls the likes of DJ Pauly D or James Kennedy. In fact, it wouldn’t be hard to imagine Quentin mugging it up in the background of Vanderpump Rules .
But ultimately, any interest in Lunatics depends entirely on how you feel about its creator.
Some find Lilley repulsive. In 2017, the comedian remixed his track “Squashed N*gga” which originated in his 2011 Australian mockumentary Angry Boys. On the show, Lilley wore blackface and a curly wig as one of his most notorious characters S.mouse, a black rapper living in Calabasas, California. He donned the racist costume again for his remix, which he posted to Instagram a day after a driver was acquitted of manslaughter after killing Elijah Doughty , a 14-year-old indigenous Australian, in a traffic collision. Lilley apologized after swift backlash , saying the video wasn’t “connected in any way to current news stories.”
For others, Lilley is a comedy titan. His best show to date, Summer Heights High , and its spinoffs Ja’mie: Private School Girl and Jonah from Tonga garnered international acclaim and pickup stateside for his peculiar, nuanced characters. For his work, Lilley has won five Logie Awards, Australia’s version of an Emmy.
Lunatics functions as a career culmination for Lilley. While none of his most infamous characters appear in the series, he is at his best and worst this time around. Lilley clearly has a keen eye for what makes great reality TV so successful. His real-life absurdism is “dope as fuck,” as his pubescent character Gavin would say. But the genre has evolved since the early 2000s, and the sensationalism of Kate Gosselin and Honey Boo Boo type characters is dated.
It doesn’t help that Lilley is just as out of touch as his characters. Lunatics ’ best character also happens to be its most controversial. Jana is a South African pet psychic to the stars. She’s the character most believable as TV fodder (looking at you, Hollywood Medium ), but Lilley uses a big, poofy afro and a dark tan as part of the costume. The blackface accusations have once again returned. “It doesn’t help that Lilley is just as out of touch as his characters.”
Show producer Laura Waters claims Lilley is portraying “a white woman with huge ’70s style curly hair.” While believable—Lilley looks eerily like Richard Simmons when in character—it’s simply a poor costuming choice. At this point in his career, Lilley should know better than to toy with even the most ambiguous references to cultural appropriation.
Then again, that’s Lilley’s signature. He seems to believe that portraying people society looks down on will force viewers to reflect on their own prejudices; however, it’s starting to look more like he simply seizes the chance to be offensive under the guise of satire. Sure, the countless real-life douchebags who serve as inspiration for the misogynistic Quentin do say “faggot” repeatedly, but Lilley doesn’t have to follow suit.
If Lilley wants to continue with his searing mockumentaries, he’d do well to modernize them. Throughout the show, I kept asking myself what the point of all this buffoonery is. Lilley isn’t exploring new terrain. If he took on an Instagram influencer or the white male late-night hosts unsure what to do with their privilege, than maybe there’d be so relevant humor. Better yet, he should satirize the growing trend of aging male comics who fear PC culture. Then, finally, we might get an idea of who Lilley really is. READ THIS LIST"

Maxwell Tani 04.20.19 5:38 PM ET
Northern Irish police said a “new brand of terrorism” was responsible for the death of a well-respected journalist who was killed last week as they announced the arrest of two teenagers in connection with the killing.
Twenty-nine year-old journalist and LGBT activist Lyra McKee was fatally shot on Thursday while covering a clash between police and nationalist rioters in Londonerry. She was standing near police officers when rioters fired gunshots and threw petrol bombs at police.
During a press conference on Saturday, police in Northern Ireland announced that arrested two men, 18 and 19 years old, under the country’s terrorism act in connection with McKee’s murder. They have been taken thw two to Musgrave Serious Crime Suite for questioning.
On Friday, police blamed McKee’s murder on gunshot wounds fired indiscriminately , and released footage of a masked gunman firing during the riots.
“What we are seeing is a new breed of terrorist coming through the ranks and that for me is a very worrying situation,” Police Service of Northern Ireland Superintendent Jason Murphy said.
Violence has flared in Northern Ireland over the past several months as the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union has once again raised questions about the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland’s borders.
Law enforcement on Friday blamed the killing on members of the New Irish Republican Army. The small group rejects the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, which put an end to the unrest of the period dubbed the Troubles and years of sectarian civil war between Irish nationalists and UK loyalists. According to the Associated Press, the group has also been blamed for a car bombing in Londonderry earlier this year, as well as several killings over the past several years. The group also claimed it sent mail bombs across the UK.
McKee, an independent journalist whose work covering the conflict in Northern Ireland once earned her a spot on the Forbes 30 under 30 list, was just weeks away from publishing her first book about young people who disappeared during the Troubles.
Her death sparked an outpouring of grief from journalists and many local and international political figures.
“This cannot stand,” her partner Sara Canning said during a vigil on Friday . “Lyra’s death must not be in vain because her life was a shining light in everyone else’s life, and her legacy will live on in the light that she’s left behind.” READ THIS LIST"

Journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead in Northern Ireland on Thursday evening in what police are calling a “terrorist incident,” BBC News reports. Dissident Republicans were rioting in Derry—reportedly in response to police searches in the city’s Creggan area—when she was fatally shot. “Sadly I can confirm that following shots being fired tonight in Creggan, a 29 year old woman has been killed,” Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton wrote in a tweet . “We are treating this as a terrorist incident and we have launched a murder enquiry.” In addition to the rioters and police exchanging gunfire, the protesters also reportedly threw petrol bombs at police vehicles. Journalists on Twitter have identified the deceased woman as McKee, who tweeted a photo from the scene earlier Thursday night. According to The Guardian , the unrest comes ahead of when Republicans commemorate the 1916 Easter Rising—an insurrection waged by the Irish to end British rule.

Saudi Sisters Escape to Georgia and Plead for Asylum on Twitter,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/saudi-sisters-escape-to-georgia-and-plead-for-asylum-on-twitter,"ON THE RUN Saudi Sisters Escape to Georgia and Plead for Asylum on Twitter The two Saudi sisters, Maha al-Subaie, 28, and Wafa al-Subaie, 25, took to Twitter as @GeorgiaSisters late Tuesday night to make a plea for their lives. 04.20.19 11:23 PM ET via Twitter
TBILISI, Georgia—For the people of Saudi Arabia, its victims, and anyone who values human rights, Wednesday, April 17th, was a painful day.
First, President Trump vetoed a bill that would have ended U.S. support for the Saudi war in Yemen.
Then, an abrupt cancellation of a criminal court in Riyadh left some 30 Saudi human rights activists in prison. Among the detained are two U.S. citizens and the dissident Loujain al-Hathloul, who was arrested for campaigning against the Saudi male guardianship system and for the woman’s right to drive.
Accused of espionage, al-Hathloul and others were waterboarded, electrocuted and by some counts sexually abused in the basement of a secret prison near Jeddah by a member of the crown prince’s inner circle. The UN Human Rights Council and a host of Western countries have demanded their release to no avail.
And finally, two more women fled from Saudi Arabia to avoid abuse. This time they came to the post-Soviet country of Georgia where they waged yet another social media campaign begging for their lives.
All of this went down on Wednesday. And if that’s not enough, the Mueller report dropped the following morning making it nearly impossible for the sisters to stand out in the Interweb’s echo chamber. But stand out they did.
The two Saudi sisters, Maha al-Subaie, 28, and Wafa al-Subaie, 25, took to Twitter as @GeorgiaSisters late Tuesday night to make a plea for their lives. They are just the latest of an estimated 1,000 women a year (though likely tons more) who escape the kingdom’s ongoing gender apartheid under the penalty of death to avoid domestic abuse and torture.
A full day and nearly 4,000 concerned followers later, the girls once again disappeared. Everyone rooting for them feared the worst. When wanted Saudi dissidents vanish, it usually means only one thing—à la Jamal Khashoggi.
Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch, told The Daily Beast, “Saudi women make dangerous attempts to flee Saudi Arabia for numerous reasons including systematic discrimination and dearth of places to turn for help in cases of domestic abuse. Any country that receives escaping Saudi women should allow them to make asylum claims and assess those claims fairly. Forcible return of Saudi women can result in forced isolation or even violence.”
Before their disappearance Maha and Wafa had been hiding out in Tbilisi for three weeks after fleeing from their abusive family in Saudi Arabia. Like all Saudi women they had lived as second-class citizens or “permanent legal minors” in too often-harrowing conditions, threatened not only by a totalitarian regime but by their families as well.
The App from Hell
According to the kingdom’s male guardian laws, women in Saudi Arabia are not allowed to travel without permission from a male family member. Thanks to a secret online network of dissident women, the sisters found a workaround to get out of the country.
The girls stole their father’s phone and signed into the Saudi government-backed “woman-tracking” application called Absher . From there, they reset the password and then granted themselves permission to leave the country. The girls won’t say where they got their passports.
The controversial app is provided by both Google and Apple. Absher allows a Saudi man to do things like order passports or government documents online. The app also will send male users SMS alerts when their female presents a passport at any border, in case the female tries to flee without permission.
Basically, this allows a man to track his women’s movements. Remember those 1,000 women a year who escape? This is how Saudi men try to stop them.
According to TIME , “The app allows male users to log the information of their dependents and to grant or revoke permission for them to travel at the click of a button.”
Fortunately, Georgia also has a visa free regime with Saudi Arabia, so the sisters could fly directly to Tbilisi. Unfortunately, this also means that their father, brother and cousins can follow them to Georgia at any time and at least attempt to bring them back by force.
If they did, it wouldn’t be the first time that has happened. According to the al-Subaie sisters, the French embassy in Georgia, and several other advocates for Saudi women, another young Saudi woman with the same last name, al-Subaie, fled Saudi Arabia for Tbilisi in 2018, seeking asylum and protection.
The other al-Subaie went to the French embassy where she received approval to request a visa. At the end of August last year, two days before her French visa was due to arrive, she vanished from the city. She didn’t answer calls or texts from the women in her dissident support network.
It appears that she was kidnapped from Georgia, most likely by her own family. There are also claims that she turned up in a Saudi prison. Whatever the case, for Maha and Wafa, hers is a cautionary tale.
On the Run In Georgia
It turns out the sisters’ mistrust of the Georgian government isn’t groundless. They wrote in reference to the missing al-Subaie, “We couldn’t be another forgotten story without fighting for our lives.”
“We are not safe here and we need to leave as soon as possible,” the girls told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. They aren’t incorrect.
Traveling to a third country that doesn’t have a visa free regime with the kingdom and ideally with a better track record of preventing dissident visitors from mysteriously turning up in jail back home probably would make sense.
For all its talk on democracy and human rights, the Georgian government for decades now has made an unfortunate habit out of cozying up to various despots in the region at large, the House of Saud being no exception.
Unfortunately for the Georgian government, this isn’t an isolated case. On May 29th, 2017, the Azerbaijani investigative journalist Afgan Mukhtarli was pulled off of a Georgian street in broad daylight. He was beaten, bound, and tossed into a trunk by Georgian-speaking assailants wearing Georgian police uniforms. “We are not safe here and we need to leave as soon as possible.” — the girls told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
What happened next is baffling. Afgan Mukhtarli magically appeared in an Azeri prison. On January 12th, 2017, Mukhtarli was sentenced to six years in prison.
How these mysterious uniformed men forced the journalist to cross the border into Azerbaijan against his will is criminal. How this happened while Mukhtarli’s passport sat in his home is conspiracy.
After nearly two years, the Georgian authorities still haven’t offered any credible explanation for his disappearance. The investigation fell flat long ago.
If the Georgian government could not be trusted then, how could it be now?
Yet the Georgians are not alone in their negligence or culpability in this regard. If the United States, which claims to prioritize human rights, liberty, and democracy above all else, is willing to make an exception for Saudi Arabia and look the other way—at least for the right price—then who isn’t?
Sisterhood of The Anonymous Chat Room
A friend of the al-Subaie sisters from before they left Saudi Arabia spoke to The Daily Beast on the condition on anonymity. “The point here is that this type of tribe is very dangerous. People don’t understand that yet. We don’t want this to happen to these girls. Georgia will not protect them from being kidnapped.”
As for how the girls were able to purchase plane tickets and escape? The sisters’ friend shuts down. She is careful not to expose any details about their personal lives or any of the specific methods by which the sisters’ or other girls in the past have escaped.
She explains that broadcasting vulnerabilities or potential exploits in the system might cause them to be patched up, compromising the next girl’s chances of escape. “We are all women, and we help each other,” the sisters’ friend says,
Has the al-Subaie girls’ father hired anyone to search for them? The sisters' friend says, “Anything is possible. I believe that they can do anything, and that they won’t stop until they find them. The fact that the girls showed their faces means that they will face death if their family reaches them.”
After the Saudi government canceled their passports, Maha and Wafa were essentially stateless. Their only hope was social media and their network of like-minded ladies. All of these women who managed to escape the country often provide support, logistics and advice to those girls who remain behind in the Kingdom, trapped and dreaming of escape.
Maha and Wafa explain that the abuse from their family really became a problem when Maha and her husband first became divorced. Her ex-husband then lied to her family claiming that Maha had betrayed him. As a result the girls’ family began beating them both out of shame.
For help, the girls turned to a private chatroom hosting a secret online network of Saudi women who had escaped from the kingdom.
The Dissidents
Last January, 18-year-old Rahaf Muhammad Alqunun fled Saudi Arabia and attempted to fly to Australia. She was stopped along the way in Bangkok. If she’d been sent back, she explains, then she would have been killed.
After an arduous social media campaign, several frightening days barricaded in a Thai airport hotel, countless close calls, and all kinds of pressure from Saudi authorities, Alqunun was granted asylum in Canada where she now resides.
One of the most important rules in fleeing the kingdom is that once you escape and are ready to seek asylum, then you must upload a picture of your passport in order to prove your identity when you go public on Twitter.
The al-Subaie sisters did just that. And then they took it a step further. On Wednesday, they posted a video, showing their bare faces without head scarfs.
There was no turning back. If they were deported from Georgia, kidnapped like the disappeared al-Subaie girl, caught by their family or Saudi authorities, and taken back to Riyadh or their hometown, Ranyah, then they certainly would have been killed.
With their passports invalid and with no other choice, Maha and Wafa again sought protection from their digital community of Saudi women. Over the next few days, the community responded in droves. Twitter followed suite, at times resembling some kind of electronic Underground Railroad.
People from all over the world retweeted the Saudi sisters’ requests for aid, ferrying their calls for support and protection to mainstream media outlets, where they no longer could be ignored. “There was no turning back. If they were deported from Georgia, kidnapped like the disappeared Al-Subaie girl, caught by their family or Saudi authorities, and taken back to Riyadh or their hometown, Ranyah, then they certainly would have been killed.”
The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, was bombarded with so many messages that it tweeted, “UNHCR does not comment on individual cases, including for reasons of confidentiality and data protection. We are closely monitoring the situation of the two sisters from Saudi Arabia who are currently in Georgia.”
By the end of the first day #SaveSaudiSisters was trending on Twitter. Rarely are social media accounts this uplifting.
Return of the Saudi Sisters
After an overwrought 24 hours of radio silence, despite desperate appeals from their growing Twitter following, the al-Subaie girls turned up back in Tbilisi. They had been blocked out of their Twitter account for unknown reasons, but they were safe at least for the moment.
Video footage showed Maha and Wafa arriving with government escort at the Migration Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia. In a statement on Thursday, the Georgian police announced that they had visited the girls at their temporary flat “to offer assistance and security guarantees to the women and inform them about procedures on getting asylum in Georgia.”
Strangely, despite the girls’ insistence that family members were in Georgia searching for them, the police stated that the “family members, to whom Alsubaie sisters are referring to (sic) as posing a risk for them, those family members are not in Georgia at the moment.”
How the Georgian police could know this for certain and essentially prove a negative remains unclear, unless they know much more than they are letting on. Regardless of these assurances, Twitter and the secret networks of the Saudi dissidents who helped the girls escape were rife with rumors that a group of Saudis was already in Georgia, searching for the al-Subaie sisters.
According to an interview on CBC Radio’s As It Happens , when the sisters arrived at the French embassy in Tbilisi to request asylum, the embassy told the girls that a group of men had already come by asking for the girls.
The embassy was however uncertain whether the men were with the Saudi government, the girls’ family, or a third party. In any case, it wasn’t a good sign.
The plight of the sisters brings even more attention to Saudi Arabia’s continuing gender apartheid. Under the male guardianship system, women need permission from a man to work, study, marry, and travel.
The Arab Winter
If the Donald J. Trump’s United States can be bought by Saudi Arabia, then the girls have good cause to be weary of the Georgian government. According to a statement from the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , “The amount of direct Saudian [sic] investments in Georgia has exceeded 100 million USD. Positive dynamics is observed in tourism as well. Up to 60 thousand Saudi Arabian citizens visited Georgia in 2017 alone.”
The question is: How many of them were forced back home and imprisoned? As a former Soviet republic, Georgia would do well to remember how it feels to be a prisoner in your own country.
If the uprisings that reverberated across the Middle East constituted 2011’s Arab Spring, then the October murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul suggests the coming of an Arab Winter for those living in the Saudi kingdom under the dark paradoxical regime of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Once considered a young media-savvy modernizer and technocrat, MBS showed his true colors when he began an “anti-corruption” campaign, which turned out to be just another way to consolidate power and marginalize his enemies.
Mohammed bin Salman is unique in his attempts to bill himself as a “progressive” reformer, while murdering people in broad daylight. Most autocrats just skip the liberal dance altogether.
The young crown prince is now de facto ruler of the kingdom and already more brutal, manipulative and vindictive than his father. MBS’s claims of being a “reformer” for building movie theaters are as laughable as Trump zealously repeating “No collusion, no obstruction,” in hope that it might be true.
Even the notoriously pro-Trump senator, Lindsey Graham, recently called MBS “toxic” and “a wrecking ball .” Yet, in a curious move even for Trump, the embattled president refuses to criticize the kingdom’s habit of abusing, torturing, and murdering its own citizens.
On Wednesday, as the al-Subaie sisters implored the West for help, the Trump administration vetoed an uncommonly bipartisan piece of legislation to end the war Yemen, which was passed by Congress in response to Jamal Khashoggi’s murder.
Trump claimed that it was “an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken [his] constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.” In so doing, the president ensured that the United States’ official response to the assassination of U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist was a belligerent, deafening, and murderous silence.
To be fair, the U.S.’s silence on Saudi human rights was purchased long before Trump took the White House. The Obama administration certainly continued the same quid-pro-quo Saudi-American relationship that has pre-dated World War II.
Death Threats from Zealots
The al-Subaie sisters write from their new Twitter account, @GeorgiaSisters2, “We were laying low. We did not wanted to publish our personal information or come out to the media, but when we knew that there was a report against us and that the police were looking for us we had to do it.”
On Friday just when things seemed to be calming down for the girls, the death threats began rolling in. But these weren’t your “typical” death threats, unlike those you might find peppered all over the girls’ Twitter account from random zealots and Saudi trolls who when at a loss for online niceties jump straight to the murder of young women.
But these death threats came from the girls’ cousin and, even, their brother. The boys warned the sisters that all of their cousins had already arrived in Georgia, claiming that if they find you, they will kill you.
As the sisters’ Saudi friend puts it, “Their family will easily kill them in the name of honor. I know that because I came from a big tribe too. They will not stop until they honor their tribe. And by that, I mean kill them.”
She continues, “It is impossible to live in Georgia while being chased. We want to move them [the sisters] to an anonymous country, so they can start a normal happy life without the need to worry about their lives.”
The al-Subaie sisters have a message for the folks at @refugee (the UN refugee agency). In one of their last tweets on that ill-fated Wednesday, before they vanished for 24 hours, the girls wrote: “We need URGENT help. We are trapped if we disappeared it’s your responsibility. @Refugees.”
Things Left Behind
What’s most heartbreaking of all is that Maha had to leave behind her young son when she fled the Kingdom. She tweets, “I have a little son, and the circumstances in Saudi forced me to leave him. It was devastating for me to see him watched me being abused by my father.”
So when a Saudi troll with the username @aleef911, leaves yet another death threat below this heartfelt message from a mother to her son, it is an astoundingly telling and no doubt unintended contrast.
On one side is an angry little man who writes, “No one leave his baby alone should be scared.” Indeed what @aleef911 intended to say was, “Anyone who leaves her baby alone should be scared,” but then ignorance and hatred often go hand in hand.
On the other is a young woman who has overcome the very worst of her culture, her religion, and even her family, to courageously claim her life for the very first time.
She writes, “To my little son: You may read this message someday, I hope you forgive me for. I did not have another solution, I hope to hug you even for a moment, but I promise you will meet someday, please forgive me, I love you.”
If they can endure, the al-Subaie girls, like so many women in their dissident network, will emerge as reluctant but worthy leaders setting an example for an entire generation of young Saudi women. Whether anyone likes it or not, in 2019 when Twitter reigns, the whole world is watching.
Though they might not realize it yet, Maha and Wafa al-Subaie have already begun to fight back. Each day they grow stronger. The girls have already earned something akin to celebrity, though with all the death threats right now, it may not seem that way.
The same cannot be said for MBS’s Saudi Arabia. The House of Saud’s gender apartheid grows weaker and more desperate by the day, with every girl who escapes and each scandal that comes. By simply surviving, not to mention tweeting, they are a thorn in the side of a hate-filled regime, propped by the worst of antiquity and the saddest of fears.
On Friday morning, Maha and Wafa al-Subaie released photographs of their injuries and audio recordings of their abuse as proof. The shrieks of agony are difficult to listen to. It’s hard to believe that it is them in the recording.
With an ever-growing following of supporters behind them, the sisters seem different now from a mere two days ago. Even under the gravest of threats from those who were the closest to them, the al-Subaie sisters are somehow untouchable. Somehow they are free.
The Saudi sisters write, “A lot of torture a lot of violence, it’s really hard for us to hear it again [broken heart emoji] but this is for all the people who called us liars.” READ THIS LIST"

Sharing the name of the man at the center of one of the most controversial episodes in recent political memory has made life a little weird. The politicians Mueller interviews on his show have ribbed him about how long it’s taken to get to the bottom of the Trump mess. Hosts at restaurants where he’s made reservations have offered “a-ha!” glances when he shows up to eat. And his Facebook feed has been a cesspool of loonies and MSNBC moms offering support.
“It would happen whenever I would post a Trump story that he was involved in,” Mueller explained. “Then the vitriol would start from the Trump people. That’s the part that always amazed me—that there were people out there who thought Robert Mueller actually had a Facebook page. But they believed it. And some of the stuff was nasty. ‘Eff you, you should be put of the jail, you’re part of the deep state.’”
Few names are as ubiquitous these days as Bob Mueller. Podcasts have been launched in his honor; Christmas carol lyrics have been reimagined with his investigation in mind; T-shirts touting “ Mueller Time ” have popped off the racks; Robert De Niro has portrayed him on SNL; and an entire sub-industry of reporters has been tasked with collecting each breadcrumb he leaves behind.
Mueller’s mystique has only grown due to the astonishingly low profile he’s kept. But while the special counsel has stayed quiet, Bob Mueller the newscaster has soldiered on.
There is no confusing the two men. They don’t look alike, aren’t related, and pronounce their last names differently—it’s Moo-ller (like a cow) for Bob from Tennessee. One has become a national hero for liberals. The other isn’t sure his name gets him any perks in a state filled with Trump fans.
“This is Tennessee,” he explains. “I’m not sure how helpful it would be. I got to go to L.A. for it to work.”
But their lives have intersected, and not just because Bob Mueller the newsman has been consumed by the work of Bob Mueller the special counsel.
“I’m obsessed with it,” he admits. “I’m a junkie. I watch it every night. I probably know more about it than anyone else in the state.”
Bob Mueller, the newscaster, is a St. Louis kid who grew up in farm country but didn’t want to work on a farm. So he turned to radio at the age of 15, doing news dispatches for an audience of farmers that surrounded him. The news bug bit and, from there, he continued working in broadcast through college and beyond. Eventually, he found his way to Chattanooga where he was asked to do investigative and documentary work before shifting over to the state capital.
In 2002, he went to Kandahar, Afghanistan, to embed with the 101st Airborne Division. While there, he got a tip that John Walker Lindh, the captured American Taliban fighter, was going to be brought in before being taken back to the United States. Word was that the FBI director—a man named Bob Mueller—was going to show up to help with the transfer.
Sure enough, the tip panned out.
“Here comes this car, it’s a jeep, and he pops out of the car,” Bob Mueller, the newscaster, recalled. “I start asking him questions and he is just steel-nosed. He never looks at me at all. I realize he is not going to talk to me. But we caught eyes and I’m wearing my press credentials and it says Bob Mueller. So I flashed it at him and he gave me a thumbs and just walks on.”
There wasn’t much overlap after that, even as Mueller, the FBI director, stayed at his post. But then, in May 2017, word broke that Mueller was being appointed special counsel to investigate Russia’s electoral interference and Trump’s role in it.
By that point, TV’s Mueller had won numerous Emmys and Peabody awards for investigative reporting and was hosting his own Sunday morning political show, This Week with Bob Mueller . There was no doubt that he would be covering the work of the man whose name he shared.
“I remember thinking I have to remember to say his name the correct way,” Mueller said of covering Mueller.
For nearly two years, Mueller, the newscaster, has followed along closely as the investigation has played out. He’s had fun with it, telling groups he’s speaking to that he’s grateful to be there instead of spending his “days prosecuting the Russians before doing the evening newscast.”
And he’s thought about petitioning the president for an interview on the grounds that he may as well sit down with one Bob Mueller.
“I’m friends with a bunch of these Republicans here,” he said. “A lot of them are tight with Trump. Maybe they can help me out,”
But mostly, he’s just covered it as a newscaster does, keeping a distance from the online mobs that have descended on his Facebook page to lodge their complaints at the man they believe is personally harassing Trump. “I didn’t want to get into the protracted stupid arguments,” the other Bob says.
On Thursday, when the Mueller report finally came out, Mueller did what he normally does: he mined it for news. Starting at 9 a.m. he began watching coverage. Then he began reading excerpts before putting out a post unpacking the confusion that laid ahead for WKRN viewers.
“A lot of Bob Mueller discussion in Nashville today,” it read. “I, Bob Mueller on the left will be reporting about Bob Mueller on the right and his Mueller Report. You will hear the words written by Bob Mueller on the right from the Mueller Report in the voice of Bob Mueller on the left because Bob Mueller on the right is not speaking today. Got that.”
Mueller the journalist doesn’t give many hints about what he thinks about the report’s findings that Trump sought the help of the Russians and that he likely obstructed the investigation even if he can’t be legally charged. Mostly, he sees some benefits in the report being released.
Yes, there is some sense of closure for the country. But the vitriol that he gets online may slow down or even stop and he can finally renew his quest to become the nation’s better-known Mueller.
“Exactly,” he said. “I got an opportunity now.” READ THIS LIST"

But dig into his letters and you'll find an intense devotion to erasing all forms of oppression. 04.20.19 11:22 PM ET Public Domain
During the past decade, if not before, I’ve been wrestling with an angel: Paul the Apostle . I’ve been reading the letters of Paul intensely from the time I was a young man, drawn by his wild and visionary sense of reality, his “invention” of Christianity, his example as a man who moved through the wide cosmopolitan world of the first century without the slightest fear of consequences. (In this, he’s very different from me and, I suspect, most of us!) As Easter approaches, I begin to think about what Paul said when he urged us to “take on the mind of Christ” [Philippians 2.5], which in his theology means entering completely into this cosmic spirit so that the spirit itself becomes part of us.
My own spiritual journey has been a textual one in part, living in the gospels and letters of Paul as a reader, digging into the Greek words themselves to unearth their full meaning. This work, most recently, has led to a series of 21 lectures that I recorded some months ago about Jesus, Paul, and the early Christians. And I have just published The Damascus Road: A Novel of Saint Paul .
In this novel, I write as Paul in the first person, countering or “correcting” his narrative with that of his traveling companion, Luke, who wrote the Gospel of Luke and, of course, the Acts of the Apostles , the latter being an account of their missionary journeys through the Roman world—a journey that ended with the martyrdom of Paul in Rome around the time of the great fire of 64 A.C.E. Luke’s cool-headed view of what was happening stands (at least in my novel) in contrast to Paul’s mad visionary rhetoric, as embodied in his letters.
To write this, I had to sink into the physical as well as mental geography of these men, traveling to the Holy Lands (what I call Palestine in the novel, as all of this region was called in Roman times), to the Jordanian desert, to Asia Minor or what is now Turkey, to Greece and Italy. I followed as best I could in the footsteps of Paul, hoping to summon that world in images, trying at all times to remind myself how these places would have played on the five senses, with its tingling atmosphere of herbs and spices, wild flowers, shit in the streets, decaying bodies, brilliant sunshine on the sea, and evergreen forests as deep as one can imagine.
This was an intellectual journey as well as a physical one. Like Plato , Paul was a founding thinker in the West. In fact, I began to write this novel after reading again through the Dialogues of Plato—always a text I return to for inspiration and bracing mental exercise. I realized how many of Plato’s ideas, even phrases, had sunk into Paul’s unconscious. He casually quotes from the great philosopher throughout his letters. The very idea of the eternal soul was, of course, illumined by Plato, and Paul ran with this, creating a Platonic theology.
It’s important to recall that Paul was a Greek-speaking Jew, born in Tarsus (now in Turkey), privately educated there by Greek-influenced tutors—the latter is an assumption, but one that seems to make sense, given his erudition, his command of Greek prose, his range of allusion. His status as one of the elite is evident in the fact that he “transferred” to the academy run by Gamaliel in Jerusalem as a young man. Only the child of a wealthy family would have been shipped to a far-off country to study under a major scholar like Gamaliel, the grandson of Hillel—the famous Jewish sage.
But what mostly drew me to Paul was his vision of equality—not what one usually thinks about when one thinks of Paul. Indeed, many friends who heard I was writing about Paul raised an eyebrow or two, saying: Wasn’t he a patriarchal misogynist who hated all gays?
My answer, invariably, was No! No! No!
Paul’s chief idea was this, as found in Galatians 3:28: “In Christ there is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free man, neither male nor female. In Christ, all of these are one.” For me, this is the key verse in the entire New Testament.
Boldly, Paul erased the most crucial barriers of his day. Himself a Jew, a member of the tribe of Benjamin, a Pharisee by affiliation, he took the Good News (as he called it) to the West, understanding that if the Way of Jesus were to prosper, it would have to go beyond this powerful boundary. In this, he fought against the church in Jerusalem, led by James, the brother of Jesus , who wished only for the Way to remain a kind of hyper-Jewish sect devoted to the strict adherence to the Law of Moses. Had James won out over Paul, Christianity would soon have dwindled to a tiny group in the Holy Land, one that would soon be overridden, obliterated by time and circumstances.
Needless to say, Paul challenged class divisions when he erased the boundaries between slave and free man. Remember that half of the people one met in the ancient world were slaves. Paul would have grown up with a houseful full of slaves who fetched water, bought food in the market, cooked and cleaned, raised the children, and so forth. Most of the people working for Paul’s father in his tent-making business in Tarsus would have been slaves. And slaves were invisible, not really people, hardly creatures in possession of a “soul” or—in Greek—psyche. Paul didn’t want to see divisions among the classes, believing that enlightenment (a word I prefer over the less interesting and misleading term “salvation”) would come to everyone in the end, slaves as well as free men and women.
Which brings us, crucially, to men and women. Paul had no doubt that women were equal to men in the sight of God, in the mind of Christ. The world of early Christianity was largely financed and led by women, including the powerful Phoebe, Lydia, and Priscilla. Phoebe is described as a presiding officer in the early movement, a deacon, a dominant figure. She could easily be seen as the first Pope, although there were no such offices as the church was not an official body but a loose aggregation of gatherings with no hard rules or clear theology. Indeed, Paul sent his most important piece of writing, an epistle to the Roman gathering, in the possession of Phoebe, this spirited woman of the world who traveled widely and knew every leader in the early Christian movement.
But what about the patriarchal Paul who said women shouldn’t speak in church? There are two mentions of this, one in the 14th chapter of 1 Corinthians, one in 1 Timothy. The former is widely considered a later addition, an “interpolation” by editors. In this case, the assertion that women should be silent wildly interrupts the flow of the passage, which is whole without it. And the infamous remark is not present in several early manuscripts of this letter. Furthermore, the injunction contradicts the main thrust of the epistle, where (in 1 Corinthians 11:5) Paul says that women should “prophesy and pray” in church. It just makes no logical sense for Paul to follow with a command for them to remain silent: This was an editorial hand at work, much later. And the matter of 1 Timothy is easily discarded as not something written by Paul himself.
Paul only wrote seven letters that survive: Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, 1 Thessalonians, Philippians, and Philemon. The remaining six letters are “school of Paul,” written much later. To anyone who reads Greek, the difference in prose style is obvious—Garry Wills burrows into this with common sense in What Paul Meant (2006). The differences between the two clumps of letters is profound: They come from wildly different worlds, with different underlying assumptions. A frantic effort was underway on the part of some within the evolving movement to keep the patriarchal practices of Judaism and the Roman world in place. Hence the “pastoral epistles,” 1 and 2 Timothy, which are very late indeed as additions to the New Testament canon. “Paul sent his most important piece of writing in the possession of Phoebe, this spirited woman of the world who traveled widely and knew every leader in the early Christian movement.”
There is also the complicated matter of Paul’s sexuality. I tend to agree with Bishop John Shelby Spong, a brilliant theologian and church leader, who argues that Paul was “a rigidly controlled gay male,” as he writes in Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism (1991). Be this as it may, Paul was clearly at war with his own body, tormented by the idea if not the reality of sexual desire, and eager to withdraw into the company of his male companions: Luke, Timothy, Silas, and others. His conflicted feelings about his own sexual nature may account for the “thorn in his flesh” that he wrote about in his second letter to the church at Corinth. (2 Corinthians 12:7-9)
In my view, the authentic Paul was combative, fiercely intellectual, probably depressive, bi-sexual or gay, a radical visionary who had a fiery image in his head of a new heaven and a new earth. He had a vision of what it meant to take on the full mind of Christ, and this involved emptying himself out thoroughly, taking up the cross, which for him meant following the path of self-abandonment, uniting with the mind of Christ, where everything—male and female, slave and free man, Jew and Gentile—finds reconciliation in unity with God in the eternal moment of Resurrection.

Why My Family Didn't Go to the Ganges to Say Goodbye,www.thedailybeast.com,deepa.lakshmin@thedailybeast.com (Deepa Lakshmin),04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/beyond-the-ganges-why-my-family-said-goodbye-at-one-of-indias-lesser-known-rivers,"MOKSHA Why My Family Didn't Go to the Ganges to Say Goodbye For my parents, going to the Ganges for my grandparents’ pujas didn’t make sense. My whole family is from Bengaluru, a South Indian state that’s nowhere near the famous river. 04.20.19 11:21 PM ET SANJAY KANOJIA
Rivers are a big deal in India. In fact, one of the country’s state courts previously declared the River Ganges — a sacred site for Hindus and a bucket-list sight for tourists — to be a “living entity” with human rights. It was a short-lived legal status, but Hindus don’t need official laws to personify or worship a body of water. The proof is in the numbers.
From January to March 2019, roughly 120 million people — equivalent to more than a third of the U.S. population — traveled to the Ganges to bathe in its water and wash away their sins. UNESCO hails this Kumbh Mela festival as “the largest peaceful congregation of pilgrims on earth.” One of its most revered locations is the intersection of three rivers: the Ganges, the Yamuna, and the mythological Saraswati . The meeting point is known as Triveni Sangam . (The word sangam , derived from Sanskrit, means the junction of two or more rivers.)
Though I was in India during the first part of the Kumbh Mela, I was more than 1,000 miles away from the crowds of sadhus (pictured above) and devotees camping out. But like them, I was also standing on the bank of a sangam : Rivers Kaveri, Lokapavani, and Hemavati. I wasn’t there to take a dip myself, but to say goodbye to my grandfather.
Nallanna Lakshminarayanaiah died on February 7, 2018 at age 98, less than one year after Radha — his wife and my grandmother — died in June 2017. The only thing longer than their last name is the incredible life they shared. Born and raised in India, they immigrated to the U.S. in 1962 and made a new home for their two kids. My dad spent his teenage years playing basketball in West Philadelphia and went to Connecticut for college. Decades later, when his parents passed, he and my mom brought their ashes back to India to scatter them according to Hindu tradition.
The Ganges is famous for such ceremonies or pujas , especially in the spiritual city of Varanasi, where funeral pyres and cremations are common. Hindus believe depositing a loved one’s ashes in the Ganges helps the deceased reach moksha — a term for freeing the soul from the cycle of reincarnation. Mohandas Gandhi’s ashes were locked up for years, but even his final resting place was the Ganges .
Yet for my parents, going to the Ganges for my grandparents’ pujas didn’t make sense. My whole family is from Bengaluru, the capital city of Karnataka, a South Indian state that’s nowhere near the famous river. Instead, they chose a sangam in Srirangapatna, Karnataka that was driving distance away from our hometown.
Though the Kumbh Mela and Ganges make the most headlines, there are multiple sangams across India where funerals take place. Traveling to the Ganges may be too expensive or inconvenient for some Hindu families, so they find a closer option. Plus, tourists generally don’t flock to these rivers, so the rituals are less rushed and more private.
I recently witnessed this firsthand at my grandfather’s immersion puja . (My parents did my grandmother’s in June 2017, but I unfortunately couldn’t accompany them to India that time.) There was a cremation ceremony in a typical U.S. funeral home, a flight to Bengaluru, and a four-hour drive to the nearest sangam . By the river, there was a no-frills concrete patio with plastic stackable chairs and a few framed photos of Hindu deities. The scene was a stark contrast from the cushy funeral homes I’d been in before. Even the urn was a plain plastic box with no decorations. My mom gathered all the prayer supplies ahead of time: a garland of flowers, milk, rice, a coconut, and more offerings.
Krishna Sharma, the priest conducting the puja , told me he’s been happily working at this spot for years. As a Brahmin, he said, it was his duty to send souls to moksha . (Brahmins are the highest caste in Hinduism, and though adherence to the caste system varies throughout India, many priests happen to be Brahmin because in the ancient past, they were the most educated caste.)
Besides Sharma and one other priest — who surprisingly remembered my parents from their last trip there with my grandmother’s ashes — the only other people present were my family members. It was blissfully quiet except for the priest’s hymns. That was the beauty of this sangam . As we watched my grandfather float down the river, we took our time celebrating his long and full life without anyone else sharing that space. Had we been at the Ganges, I don’t know if we would have had the same type of unforgettable moment as a family.
A few weeks after saying goodbye to my grandpa, my parents paid a visit to the Ganges as tourists themselves. Could they have brought his ashes with them and done the puja there? Sure, but my dad chose to honor him in Karnataka instead. I understand why. READ THIS LIST"
The Mystery of Why Michelangelo Burned His Sketches Just Before He Died,www.thedailybeast.com,Allison McNearney,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-mystery-of-why-michelangelo-burned-his-sketches-just-before-he-died,"Lost Masterpieces The Mystery of Why Michelangelo Burned His Sketches Just Before He Died In the days before Michelangelo’s death, while his health was deteriorating, the artist built two bonfires and burned everything he could get his hands on. 04.20.19 11:21 PM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Getty
At the end of a long vaulted room in the Galleria dell’Accademia, there stands a man who has been hailed as the embodiment of perfection.
He looks nonchalantly off to the side while positioned in a casual contrapposto stance. His abs ripple in the natural light that gleams through the domed ceiling, his curly hair is perfectly coiffed with every strand defined, and his fingers and toes are faithfully detailed down to the creases and veins in a show of artistry that just might bring viewers to tears.
This man is the David sought out by millions of tourists visiting Florence each year, and he represents the pinnacle of Renaissance sculpture.
But if you were to study the drawings, cartoons, and papers left behind by Michelangelo, the genius behind this work, you would be forgiven for thinking the master sculptor picked up his chisel one day and carved this ideal specimen out of thin air. No preparatory drawings for the David exist.
Michelangelo worked hard to hone his talent and skills, not to mention his public perception (he was an early genius at personal branding), and it paid off. During his lifetime, he was lionized and his work highly sought after by the top patrons of his day. But he didn’t always want to put on display the effort that it took to achieve this greatness.
While 600 of the master’s drawings have survived, that is but a fraction of the preparatory works he is believed to have produced throughout his lifetime. (His elder and rival Leonardo da Vinci , for instance, left a surviving 4,000 pages.)
A variety of factors contributed to the loss including the vagaries of time, but for many of the drawings, it was the artist himself who was the agent of destruction. In the days before Michelangelo’s death, while his health was deteriorating, the artist built two bonfires and burned everything he could get his hands on.
This was not the first time Michelangelo had consigned his work to the fire.
By 1518, the sculptor was in his early forties and already a well established artist in Renaissance Italy.
By this time, he had sculpted the Pietà, Bacchus, and the David and painted the Sistine Chapel. He had completed multiple commissions for the Vatican, before being called up to Florence in 1515 by the other great pillar of artistic patronage of the era—the Medicis. (In the second half of his career, these two became one and the same.)
Throughout Michelangelo’s development as an artist, drawing was his foundation. It was where he developed his ideas and his technique, where he worked out technical problems, and where he explored innovations. He embraced the concept of “disegno,” the idea of drawing and design that reigned in Florence at the time.
According to Alan Riding in The New York Times , Michelangelo wrote a note to a student in 1520, imploring him to, “Draw Antonio, draw Antonio, draw and don't waste time.”
While drawing was essential to developing a vaunted artistic practice, it was not at the top of the hierarchy of art according to Michelangelo. It landed squarely behind sculpture, painting, and then architecture.
But just because Michelangelo didn’t rank his sketches up there with the David doesn’t mean he wasn’t protective of these works.
Maybe the Pope Julius IIs and the Lorenzo de’ Medicis of the world could afford to commission grand sculptures and paintings and chapels from him, but the ordinary denizens of the upper class in the Italian city-states had to content themselves with getting their hands on any piece of the star artist that they could.
His drawings were in high demand and Michelangelo was not always happy when they made their way into the world.
Riding writes that Michelangelo once scolded his father via post for showing some of his drawings to “outsiders,” and in Michelangelo: The Achievement of Fame , Michael Hirst describes some of his actions as driven by “his intense dislike, if not paranoia, of unauthorized access to his creations.”
It was perhaps in this psychological climate that the first recorded instance of Michelangelo destroying his own preparatory works occurred. In early 1518 he ordered his assistant in Rome, Leonardo Sellaio, to burn some cartoons that were stored at his house. “On February 5, 1519 Sellaio reported that almost all of them had been burnt; he expresses his grief over the decision, while confirming that he has devotedly carried it out”
Cartoons were the preliminary drawings artists made to transfer designs onto walls or canvases, and in this instance it is believed that Michelangelo had it in for the cartoons he used to paint the Sistine Chapel.
“On February 5, 1519 Sellaio reported that almost all of them had been burnt; he expresses his grief over the decision, while confirming that he has devotedly carried it out,” Hirst writes.
This was not welcome news to the many Michelangelo acolytes, not to mention scholars from the following centuries. During the artist’s life, at least one of his supporters, Pietro Aretino, begged him to stop destroying his drawings.
In Michelangelo Drawings: Closer to the Master , Hugo Chapman writes that Aretino, “in his sustained but unsuccessful attempt to wheedle the gift of some drawings out of Michelangelo, mentions in letters to the artist written from Venice in 1538 and 1546 that he would be happy to accept works that might otherwise end up being burnt.”
He would have been appalled to learn what Michelangelo would do at the end of his life. In 1546, when the sculptor was in his early seventies, his health began to decline. Michelangelo had experienced the recent deaths of several close friends and he must have known what was in store for him.
He made a very short will “leaving his soul to God, his body to the earth, and his material possessions to his nearest relations,” Howard Hibbard writes in Michelangelo . And then he decided to cull those material possessions.
According to reports from the artist’s nephew, Michelangelo made two bonfires and proceeded to burn all of the drawings and works on paper that were in his studio in Rome at the time. The only things that survived were some of the cartoons and two drawings.
We will never know for sure what treasures were burned in those final bonfires or why Michelangelo was so determined throughout his life to keep his process from being seen. His secretive nature surely played a role and it wasn’t entirely unfounded. He had rival artists and up-and-comers nipping at his heels eager to decode the secrets of his innovative style and genius.
But there is another explanation for his actions, one promoted by Giorgio Vasari, the biographer to the Renaissance artists. “I know that a little before he died he burned a great number of designs, sketches, and cartoons made with his own hand, to the end that no one might see the labours endured by him and his methods of trying his genius, and that he might not appear less than perfect”
Vasari believed that Michelangelo wanted to maintain an aura of perfection, and he wanted to hide the painstaking work that had gone into creating each of his masterpieces. In short, he was trying to control the narrative and image of Michelangelo, the Great Sculptor, so he burned the evidence of the work and process it took to get there.
As Vasari wrote ,“I know that a little before he died he burned a great number of designs, sketches, and cartoons made with his own hand, to the end that no one might see the labours endured by him and his methods of trying his genius, and that he might not appear less than perfect.”
Artistic genius aside, Michelangelo, it turns out, may not have been that different from us all. READ THIS LIST"

Levi Higgs 04.20.19 11:21 PM ET
I n November of 2018, the most aptly named biography to ever exist was published: Born to Be Posthumous: The Eccentric Life and Mysterious Genius of Edward Gorey .
Written by Mark Dery, it covers with great detail the macabre and bizarre author Edward Gorey. Many readers will know Gorey’s most famous work, The Gashlycrumb Tinies : Published in 1963, it tells the tales of small children meeting their theatrical deaths, written to the tune of an alphabet book.
“Eccentric” is a good word to latch onto when it comes to Gorey, a man who not only wrote about the alliterative deaths of small children in alphabetical order, but also pranced around New York City in extravagant fur coats, and bedecked every finger with huge silver rings. Even more mysterious: Gorey was, in actuality, a pretty well-adjusted man.
Born in 1925, Gorey was a precocious child prodigy with a flair for writing and the arts, and he attended the prestigious Francis Parker School in the Chicago area. After graduating, he served briefly in World War II, and then enrolled in Harvard in 1946, studying French literature. How dramatic.
His professional life lead him to New York City, working first at publishing giant Doubleday, where he illustrated covers for many books. By the mid-1960s, he was freelancing on illustrating books as well as creating his own. His hatch-marked style of illustration is instantly recognizable and iconic today.
Also in the 1960s, Gorey also became enamoured with the New York City Ballet, and it was even reported that he made sure to attend every single performance of every single ballet choreographed by George Balanchine. It was around this time that press photos depict Gorey in his luscious furs and extravagant silver jewelry.
Gorey’s jewels of choice were anything but ordinary, especially for a mid-century man. There were chunky silver rings and bracelets of every sort and skulls that he wore as pendants, mostly purchased from different antique shops in New York City. Gorey did inherit some more conventional jewelry from his mother and his aunt, as well.
Rick Jones, the director of the Edward Gorey House, spoke to The Daily Beast about Gorey’s collection of jewelry: “Edward’s collection of jewelry was vast—he had hundreds of rings, bracelets and neck pendants. Most of the pendants were not meant to be worn as jewelry but were found objects that he strung and wore around his neck. He seemed to have a different favorite piece every day.”
Kevin McDermott wrote a lot about Gorey’s fascination with jewelry in his book Elephant House; or, The Home of Edward Gorey : ""Edward wore jewelry long before it was a common occurrence to see men wearing earrings, finger rings, and neck pendants. African, Tibetan, and Indian jewelry were of particular interest to him. Some of his rings were so heavy and awkward that one had to wonder how he could function with such obstacles…” Indeed, he was hardly seen without them encircling every finger and wrist, and it gives one that much more admiration for the exacting precision of his illustration style.
McDermott also wrote that “some of the rings were not rings at all, they were antique gold weights that jewelers once used to measure various ounces of gold…. Inspired by the 1961 French film Cleo from 5 to 7, whose heroine hung her necklaces on the wall, Edward dealt with the problem of his ever-growing collection of jewelry by hanging his rings and pendant on wooden racks that had once held spools of thread.""
In 1979, Gorey purchased an old sea captain’s home that was over 200 years old on Cape Cod, a place he had frequently visited in summer since childhood. The home, Elephant House, later became his hidden sanctuary, an escape from New York City, where he withdrew and continued to work on artwork and theatrical projects. After his death in 2000, the home was turned into the Edward Gorey House Museum, and operates annually from April through December.
So, what happened to the jewelry after his death? Many pieces were given to friends and family, but much of his collection was kept by the Edward Gorey Charitable Trust, much of which is now on display at the Edward Gorey House Museum in the Yarmouth Port Common, Cape Cod, Massachusetts."

This coming Easter marks the 80th anniversary of the concert that, long before the 1963 March on Washington and Martin Luther King Jr. ’s “I have a dream” speech , established the Lincoln Memorial as sacred space for protesting racial injustice in America.
On Easter Sunday 1939, Marian Anderson , then America’s best-known classical singer, gave a free concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial after being denied the opportunity to perform at Washington, D. C.’s Constitution Hall. Anderson was African-American. Constitution Hall had a “white artists only” policy.
In 1939 Anderson’s Lincoln Memorial concert was celebrated by many as a near-perfect blend of art and politics. Today, at a time when the Trump administration continually fosters racial tension, Anderson’s concert seems even more remarkable than it originally did.
Anderson, who was born in 1897, was at the peak of her career in 1939. In 1925 she made her debut with the New York Philharmonic, and in the ’30s she became a success in Europe. During a Scandinavian tour she impressed Finnish composer Jean Sibelius so much that he dedicated his song “Solitude” to her, and in 1935, after listening to her perform at Salzburg, the famed conductor Arturo Toscanini told Anderson , “A voice like yours is heard once in a hundred years.”
The battle that led directly to Anderson’s Lincoln Memorial concert, as Allan Keiler has shown in his biography, Marian Anderson: A Singer’s Journey , began in early 1939 when Howard University asked to use Constitution Hall for a concert by Anderson. After its request was turned down, Howard officials appealed for help from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), whose executive secretary, Walter White, was a close friend of Anderson.
In late January, White went public with a letter he sent to the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) the owners Constitution Hall, asking them to change their “white artists only” policy. The DAR answered White’s letter with a press release declaring there was nothing exceptional in its policy. “The rules governing the use of Constitution Hall are in accordance with the policy of theaters, auditoriums, hotels, and public schools of the District of Columbia,” the DAR’s president insisted.
A month later, Eleanor Roosevelt lent her prestige to the controversy, now widely covered in the media, by announcing in her “My Day” national newspaper column that she was giving up her membership in the DAR to protest its segregationist stance.
The First Lady’s defense of Anderson did not come out of the blue. In 1936 Eleanor Roosevelt had invited Anderson to perform at the White House and had begun a friendship with her that would last until Roosevelt’s death in 1962. In a 1936 “My Day” column , Roosevelt made a point of letting the country know how much she admired Anderson, writing, “My husband and I had a rare treat last night listening to Marian Anderson.”
In the wake of the DAR’s negative press release, Anderson and her supporters considered giving a free, open-air concert in the small park in front of Constitution Hall. But by March a grander idea, endorsed by both the NAACP and Anderson’s manager, impresario Sol Hurok, emerged. Anderson would, if it could be arranged, sing at the Lincoln Memorial.
Once again, Eleanor Roosevelt’s influence became critical. The Lincoln Memorial was under the control of Harold Ickes, the secretary of the interior, and before the liberal Ickes could sign off on a concert, he needed the approval of President Roosevelt. On this occasion, FDR, who throughout his years at office was very cautious on racial matters, threw caution to the winds, and quickly gave his assent . “In 1939 Anderson’s Lincoln Memorial concert was celebrated by many as a near-perfect blend of art and politics.”
The concert that followed was path-breaking for the nation and the Lincoln Memorial. Seventeen years earlier, as Christopher Thomas has recounted in his study The Lincoln Memorial & American Life , African-Americans in the crowd at the Lincoln Memorial dedication were confined to a “colored section” and the dedication speech by President Warren Harding emphasized Lincoln’s role in uniting the nation rather than his role in ending slavery.
In 1939, the emphasis was entirely different. Speaking to the nation over NBC and addressing a crowd of 75,000 that included Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, and democratic Senator Robert Wagner of New York, Secretary of the Interior Ickes declared , “When God gave us this wonderful outdoors and the sun, the moon, and the stars, He made no distinction of race, or creed, or color.”
In her autobiography, My Lord, What a Morning , Marian Anderson recalled that when she first looked out at the crowd, “I felt for a moment as though I was choking.” But she quickly regained her composure and presented her audience with a full program that ranged from “America” to Schubert’s “Ave Maria.”
Two months later Anderson returned to Washington to sing at the White House at a reception for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England, and soon after that, she was invited to sing at the world premiere in Springfield, Illinois, of John Ford’s film Young Mr. Lincoln .
The political symbolism behind both invitations was unmistakable, but Anderson made a point of treating what she had accomplished with great modesty. During World War II, when Anderson sang at a desegregated Constitution Hall in a concert for war relief, she did not crow over how the DAR had been forced to change its ways. “There was no sense of triumph,” she wrote in her autobiography. “I felt that it was a beautiful concert hall, and I was happy to sing in it.” “The political symbolism behind both invitations was unmistakable, but Anderson made a point of treating what she had accomplished with great modesty.”
It would not be until 1955, when she was past her singing prime, that Anderson was finally invited to make her New York Metropolitan Opera debut in the role of the sorceress, Ulrica, in Giuseppi Verdi’s Un Ballo in Maschera (A Masked Ball). The standing ovation that greeted Anderson when the curtain rose lasted for nearly five minutes, but the real beneficiaries of her debut as the first African-American soloist at the Met would be her successors, the African-American sopranos Leontyne Price, Jessye Norman, and Kathleen Battle.
In Anderson’s later years, honors poured in. President Eisenhower appointed her to serve as a delegate to the United Nations. She would sing at his inauguration at 1957 and at President Kennedy’s inauguration in 1961, and in 1978, she would be among the first group of artists to receive Kennedy Center Honors.
Anderson would return to the Lincoln Memorial for the 1963 March on Washington, but this time she was not alone as a performer. She was able to join a new generation of singers—Mahalia Jackson, Joan Baez, Odetta, Peter, Paul, and Mary, Bob Dylan, and the Freedom Singers—for whom politics and music were inseparable.

"M.R. James Wrote the Scariest, Not-So-Holy Ghost Story for Easter",www.thedailybeast.com,Colin Fleming,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/mr-james-wrote-the-scariest-not-so-holy-ghost-story-for-easter,"THINGS UNSEEN M.R. James Wrote the Scariest, Not-So-Holy Ghost Story for Easter Three friends, out for a seaside holiday under the Easter moon, find an ancient, buried crown. Sounds pleasant, right? Not in the hands of horror master M.R. James. 04.20.19 11:20 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast
Though we never think of Easter as a day pocked by any kind of fear, it’s certainly the holiday that represents the most macabre event out of any of them. Skinny, sage dude, who was trying to revolutionize the world with love, gets his hands and feet nailed to a cross, then spends the afternoon up there until he dies. Upon which, he is stuck in a cave with a rock jammed into its mouth, only to rise from the dead, get out, and find his friends to see if they need to test their belief in him by sticking their fingers in his nail holes. Now let’s eat the crap out of some Peeps and Cadbury Eggs!
Easter is so vernal, with a color scheme of pinks, light blues, and yellows to match, which enlivens everything from little girls’ dresses to ubiquitous Easter eggs. But what has always produced a frisson of fear in me is one of our greatest ghost stories —let’s call it top 20—written by a man who normally reserved his frights for Christmas but saw an opportunity in the soft pastel spring of Easter.
Montague Rhodes James—M.R. to his friends and to us—was born in 1862, living until 1936. He was a scholar and provost, working at a number of universities in England. But it was while he was at King’s College from 1905 to 1918 that he did what he became most famous for.
Each year, at Christmas, James would write a ghost story. These dispensed with the trappings of the spirit yarns of the Victorian age, in favor of more modern sensibilities—an emotionally hidebound, sexually repressed professor taking a holiday and encountering something otherworldly that causes him to confront who he is in this world, for instance. James invited his professor buddies and some favorite students to his rooms on Christmas Eve, and he would then commence to scare them witless. These spectral soirees were legendary.
When I point people to a horror writer, if they’re looking to get into the real good stuff—which is not Stephen King—James is one of my go-to people. But for all of his Christmas jolts, the best ghost story he ever wrote is centered on Easter. We don’t expect to be frightened at Easter, unless an endless parade of Christian iconography gives you the creeps, which I totally get. James must have known that readers—and future readers—would be ripe for petrified plucking when he composed “A Warning to the Curious.”
He was judicious in what he would write and would not pen something unless he was certain he could get it into the gem-like fashion he favored. Still, “A Warning” is as close as he got to the perfect ghost story. It is the time of the Easter Moon—which, for this story, is a bit like Echo and the Bunnymen’s “Killing Moon”—and two buddies are having a golfing holiday together in an English coastal town. The narrator buddy remarks that his golfing buddy is dead—for it is many years later—so he can’t corroborate what happened here, but he’s got a tale to tell.
The story begins with more than a page of description and scene-setting. James does this nowhere else in his canon of 30 or so stories. “Well, at the top of my little hill, a line of these firs strikes out and runs towards the sea, for there is a ridge that goes that way; and the ridge ends in a rather well-defined mound commanding the level fields of rough grass, and a little knot of fir tree crowns it. And here you may sit on a hot spring day, very well content to look at blue sea, white windmills, red cottages, bright green grass, church tower, and distant Martello tower on the south.”
These aren’t old guys on a golfing holiday. They feel about 26. They’re staying at a place which is like a dorm for adults. Old school style. You’re not supposed to be out super late. Maybe that made it cheaper. I don’t know. They’re not rich guys, but they’re certainly good guys, fair guys. And one night, as the friends sat in the lounge, one of them, Long—the man we know is dead—is playing solitaire, the narrator is writing, when a third man named Paxton joins them.
This is a story where we must note the configurations of numbers. Easter Moon out in the sky, three fellows coming together. Paxton hangs for a bit, but he’s fidgeting, and he is prevailed upon by the other two to unburden himself. Until this point, we’ve felt cozy. James pulled us in with that description, which all but produced the smell of brine and newly-dewed grass in our nostrils. We’ve felt as if we were in this room by the fire having a nice lounging session, and now that we are fully immersed, something is going to happen.
Paxton begins by asking if the two friends are aware of the legend of the three crowns. A second trinity, then. They are, but James is going to signpost this road for us and walk us down it. The legend was that three royal crowns were buried at strategic beachheads in England, to ward off invaders. To weaken them, confuse them, scatter them. One family took it upon itself to guard one of the burial spots. They did this through the generations. The last guardian was a sickly young man in his late twenties, who nonetheless camped out at night in cold and rain, guarding the crown, until he died before his time in his devotion. Paxton, who is relocating to Sweden and has a couple weeks to kill, has an easy time of learning, from simple townsfolk, where this man stationed himself, and with no remarkable effort, he dug up the crown. He also dug up something of a problem. “This is a story where we must note the configurations of numbers. Easter Moon out in the sky, three fellows coming together.”
A delicious idea, right? Sometimes you have an idea as a writer where you think, “Wait, that’s almost too perfect, did someone hit on this before?” Not unlike what happened with Paul McCartney when the melody to “Yesterday” came to him. This was one of the best ideas of James’ compact ghost story-writing career. The two friends are stoked—they are going to see a real deal Anglo-Saxon crown. “But our man gazed at us with a rueful eye,” the narrator plaintively informs us. “’Yes, he said, ‘and the worst of it is I don’t know how to put it back.”
That is the plot’s mechanism—the restoration—the re-interring/re-tombing—of the vaunted symbol that has been made visual and manifest. We are playing off of a New Testament conceit—entombed human-saving king—with Old Testament fury, for Paxton is being followed by something, though he is not sure exactly what. Which is rather worse. The friends and Paxton inspect the crown in the latter’s room. He’s careful not to let their skin come in direct contact with it. That’s very important to him. Regarding what it is following him, he expresses the beyond-creepy, pithy line that it seems to have some control of your eyes. He’s like a student coming to learn a lesson, and his first foothold in that lesson is already sufficiently terrifying in its fullness of knowledge that there is greater, unremittable fear for what must be waiting to come.
Before courage fades in the cold light of deliberation, the three agree to a plan. They will make some excuse to leave the venue they are staying at that night—it’s like you need permission from an RA—and return the crown to its barrow. As the two friends go off to get ready, Paxton asks them to make sure that the hallway coast is clear. It’s those unexpected details that make James so Jamesian. They provide the fillip—that powerful flick of nerves—to your heart. They have no problem finding the clearing in the bower by the sea where the crown had been laid. The friends stand back as Paxton works swiftly, like he’s some master archeologist going in reverse. He packs down the earth with great care after, then ushers his new friends away with celerity. That duo looks over their shoulders to see that Paxton has left his dark coat behind, and it appears to be propped up on something. “Yet, in all this quiet, an acute, an acrid consciousness of a restrained hostility very near us, like a dog on a leash that might be let go at any moment,” has been felt, and so it is both with no surprise and legitimate surprise—again, exceedingly Jamesian—that Paxton, not bothering to turn around to look, remarks that that is not his coat. “We are playing off of a New Testament conceit—entombed human-saving king—with Old Testament fury, for Paxton is being followed by something, though he is not sure exactly what.”
The next day, “on as beautiful an April morning as you could desire,” the two friends find Paxton in slightly better spirits. They are off to play a game of golf, and say they will reconnect with him after. They return from their outing to learn that Paxton just went out and seemed to be following them. The friends, naturally, don’t understand this at all, in one way, but in another, they do.
On a shingle high above the sea, they race, seeing Paxton below, running to catch up with what they realize Paxton thinks is them. He catches up with something. When the friends descend down to find his corpse, they see that his mouth is rammed with sand and broken bits of seashell. They’re fortunate that a nearby caretaker had witnessed everything and comes running to help, or else they’d be accused of murder.
There’s a cool reading by Michael Hordern—the actor who played Jacob Marley in 1951’s Scrooge—that is excellent, plus a BBC short film adaptation worth screening. But there is nothing like leaning over the pages of this story, eyes traveling along the shapes of sentences like those of the friends looking down on the racing Paxton below, to remind us of powers beyond ourselves. James has them go the way of darkness rather than light. It’s like what Easter might have been, minus a resurrection. Or, maybe, a different kind of resurrection. Hide those eggs well.

Feud Could Reportedly Drive Harry And Meghan to Africa,www.thedailybeast.com,tom.sykes@thedailybeast.com (Tom Sykes),04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/feud-could-reportedly-drive-harry-and-meghan-to-africa,"ROYAL RIFT Feud Could Reportedly Drive Harry And Meghan to Africa The reported feud between the royal couples could be part of the motivation for the move. 04.20.19 7:04 PM ET Richard Martin-Roberts/Getty Images
Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and their new baby could move to Africa for two to three years in 2020, in an attempt to defuse the bitter feud with William and Kate that has dogged them in recent months, a bombshell report in Britain’s Sunday Times is claiming.
The prince’s advisers are said to have been working on a ‘bespoke’ role for the couple which will combine work in their role as Commonwealth youth ambassadors, charity work and the job of promoting Britain.
The Sunday Times story was not immediately published on the papers website, but began to circulate on Saturday night after the paper released its front page on social media.
The report names two senior advisers as involved in the planning of the trip including Sir Christopher Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary who was ousted by Prince Charles in a bitter power struggle.
The paper suggests that the reported feud between Harry and Meghan and William and Kate could be part of the motivation for the move, saying it would give them a chance to ‘enjoy a break from the divisions that have riven the royal household in recent months.’
The Sunday Times notes that Prince Harry has spent a considerable amount of time in Lesotho and previously referred to the country as his second home. He has a good relationship with the impoverished country’s crown prince. He and Meghan have also visited Botswana twice.
The Sunday Times’ shocking report also claims that there were discussions about whether to make Harry governor-general of Australia or Canada, but these were rejected as impractical.
A source tells the Sunday Times ; “Discussions are at an early stage but the plan is to find a new way of using their soft power abilities, most likely in Africa.” READ THIS LIST"

Tarpley Hitt speaks with filmmaker Penny Lane (‘Our Nixon’) about her controversial movie. Tarpley Hitt 04.21.19 3:43 AM ET
F ive years ago, I was eating dinner at a Chinese joint in Boston when a parade of black-clad guys in hoods and horns trudged into the restaurant, up the stairs and into the black box performance space on the third floor. They were members of the Satanic Temple, who had come to Boston to perform a Black Mass—a parody ceremony aping the rituals of a Catholic service.
Their arrival had caused chaos. Catholics who believed the group planned to use a consecrated host in the ceremony poured into the streets in protest. Op-eds condemning the ceremony popped up in publications from the Boston Globe to the BBC. At the core of the fight was the question of whether fringe spiritual groups could expect the same freedom of expression that Christians exercise on a daily basis. As it turned out, they couldn’t. The Satanists were kicked out of venue after venue, until they wound up on the third floor of the Hong Kong restaurant on Massachusetts Avenue, lighting candles and murmuring in mock religious fervor.
Now, that same scene appears in the opening act of a new documentary from Penny Lane (her real name), documentarian and chronicler of weird Americana. Lane’s other movies—which range from a look at patients who believe they have Morgellons ( The Pain of Others ), to an examination of Richard Nixon’s home movies ( Our Nixon ), to the biography of a wacky radio host who launched a national campaign to cure impotence with goat testicles ( Nuts! )— tend to dig into the underbelly of our national oddities. Her latest, Hail Satan? , which premiered at Sundance in January, continues the trend. The film follows the Satanic Temple and its co-founder Lucien Greaves from its rise in the early 2010s, into the streets of Boston, and up to their legal battles in Oklahoma and Arkansas to erect a nine-foot statue of the goat-headed god Baphomet on capitol grounds.
I talked to Penny Lane about doctrinal differences among devil-worshippers, death threats, and why she regrets becoming a card carrying Satanist.
When did the Satanic Temple first register on your radar?
I’m sure it was something about the Baphomet in Oklahoma—I read about it and I just thought the headline level was cool. Then I kind of forgot about them, and then a while later, my producer sent me Anna Merlan’s Village Voice piece about them, and he was like, hey, what do you think about this as a film topic to pursue? I was like, oh yeah, I’ve heard about those people. I meant to look into that.
You have a track record of documenting weird Americana. What do you look for in a story? Did this immediately register as a Penny Lane subject?
Oh yeah, totally. Even before I knew very much, it registered as something that I would like to do. It kind of evolved. Initially, I thought it would be interesting because I thought there was a lot of deception going on, and a lot of performativity. I didn’t really get it—I thought they were pretending to be Satanists and that they were so good at pretending or that the joke went so deep that they were really sticking to it. So, initially I thought, well this is beautiful; it’s this weird, what-is-true-what-isn’t thing. There’s all these pseudonyms. It just kind of gives off a vibe of lying or pretending. So I was interested, even at that level.
What were the details that caught your attention?
I would say that the first moment when I realized this was going to be a great movie was when I saw Lucien Greaves’ interview with Megyn Kelly. I was just astonished by the performance on his part. I could not tell what was going on. It was so hard to read. Was he smirking? Was he terrified? It was just super unclear to me. I loved the ambiguity.
I read that, initially, you couldn’t tell if the Satanists were sincere or kidding, but eventually realized that they were both. At what point in the reporting process did you get a sense for how sincere this was?
I think pretty early. But you have to realize, I was meeting so many people and there were so many different things going on. It’s one thing to say, oh I realize Lucien Greaves was sincere about his mission to create the Satanic Temple; but it’s kind of different to realize that individual Satanists on the ground in Arizona were sincere about Satanism as a religion. You know what I mean? It was kind of an ongoing process, where every step we took it just became more and more clear that the only way to make sense of what was happening was to accept that these people were sincere.
Did you see that change over the course of the time you spent with them? In the opening scene, you have them endorsing Rick Scott’s bill to allow student-led prayer. That’s plainly ironic—they’re not actually endorsing him. But later, you see them do these counterprotests that are actually about Satanic values. Was there a shift?
I think there might have been a shift, but you have to realize I wasn’t around that early. By the time I showed up they were already on their way to Arkansas. So if you look at the film, basically the entire first act had already happened. By the time I showed up, the move from the Satanic Temple as a concept to the Satanic Temple as a real organization with actual members, that had already happened—that idea of it becoming real, or something funny becoming serious, or an idea manifesting into reality. That was what we kept feeling over and over again. It was already part of the story, if that makes sense. There are places in the film where my subjects will say things like, that’s the moment I really became a Satanist. There’s a sentiment of sort of faking it until it’s real, in some cases.
When, roughly, did reporting for this begin?
I’m not really a reporter, but I started researching it in the spring of 2016, and then we started filming in the fall of 2016.
Are there any statistics on the Satanists? How many there are? They obviously have to have some amount of money—for their house and the lawsuit. Are there numbers on that?
I don’t have any numbers for how many there are. Lucien Greaves says it’s somewhere around 100,000 people. But membership doesn’t really mean—it’s like $20 to get a membership card—there aren’t like membership dues or anything, so the number of people doesn’t necessarily translate into their financial thing. But they pretty much make most of their money, meager as it is, through merch sales. They sell T-shirts and tote bags and Baphomets. Figurines. Medallions. Stuff like that. People really like them and they have good merch. They also get some donations through their non-profit arm. I don’t really know anything about their finances.
Someone says early in the film that Satanism is the original troll. Trolling has become a kind of central theme in our political landscape. For the most part, at least in the film, the Satanist’s adversaries are relatively humorless, very sincere people. I’m wondering if, while following these Satanists, you ever saw them interact with opponents—like the alt-right, like 4chan—who are also irreverent about their beliefs, but just happen to have the opposite ones?
No. Nope. Never saw that. I’m sure they exist but we never came across them. It’s an interesting observation. Because I think part of what’s made the idea of trolling so salient in our culture is, frankly, it’s Twitter. It’s the flattening of the hierarchy. Everyone’s tweet is the same as everyone else’s tweet. And you too can have a big impact that belies your actual numbers. Suddenly, you can have a group like, I don’t know, the fucking white supremacists, if you want to go there. There aren’t like that many of them, but they can sure make a big impact, because if they send out incendiary tweets, we’re all going to pay attention. The Westboro Baptist Church is a good example too. At the height of their success, what did they have? Like, 20 members? I mean, they’re not a big group. It’s like one family. Yet everyone in America knows who the Westboro Baptist Church is. Isn’t that crazy? There’s an element of trolling in that. You could say it’s good media manipulation. But now we have this new word for it.
There is this climactic moment in the movie where the Detroit representative, Jex Blackmore, threatens to execute Trump on stage. You start to see these divisions in the group. Can you talk a little bit more about that? What was the response when that first happened?
Well, first of all, it’s super-important to be clear about what she did and didn’t do. She did not threaten to execute anyone. She was doing an artistic performance in a private context. In that performance, she says the words, “execute the president.”
I was in the room, and no one in that room interpreted what she said as a literal call for violence. No one. Just to be clear, it was an art piece. It certainly was an art piece that toes the line about what is legal. You can go back and find lots of examples of stand-up comedians and other people who have said things like that and been investigated by the FBI. It’s a big First Amendment quagmire. It’s just a big mess.
But essentially, the Satanic Temple as an institution decided that this performance was a huge liability to them. They don’t want to give people even the slightest ammunition to say that they were a violent group. To do that is to put them all in danger. That’s why they didn’t want anything to do with that, which I understood. I also understood that, from Jex’s point of view, the First Amendment is supposedly very important to the Satanic Temple—in some ways I wonder if they could have supported her, instead of kicking her out? But these are all things I felt were good arguments on all sides, and we just wanted to represent it as accurately as we could. It was very painful for everyone. It was a little bit inevitable, just in terms of where things were going with the institution, and how Jex was feeling about the institution. But, it was still very sad.
When she said it while you were in the room, did you feel like, oh, crap ?
No! It didn’t cross my mind! I’m so stupid. It was a really powerful performance. It was incredibly moving. It was really, really, intense. Jex is an incredible artist. Her ability to inspire a sense of urgent, creative rebellion in people is incredible. It’s really, really incredible. I’ve never known anyone like her and I have so much respect for her.
What is she up to now?
She’s doing her own thing. She’s still a Satanist—the Satanic Temple doesn’t own Satanism any more than the Church of Satan does. Although the Church of Satan thinks they own Satanism. Whatever. So, you know, it’s sort of like, she’s off doing her own thing now. I think it’s a much better outcome for everyone. She’s doing art performances all the time. She’s going to be in New York City this weekend doing something, although she won’t tell me what it is. “ This beef just doesn’t seem necessary. But that’s what’s happening. They all hate each other. They just argue on Twitter all day. It’s just super boring and depressing to everyone else in the world. ”
Can you rewind to how the Church of Satan thinks it owns Satanism? Is there beef there?
Oh God, yeah. It’s the most annoying part of my life right now. A couple times a day I check Twitter to see what’s going on with my movie. And every review or every attention the movie gets, the Church of Satan has to be like: “They are not Satanists! We are the only real Satanists! This movie is not about Satanism!” And I’m just like, you’re only making yourselves look bad. No one is going to look at this from the outside and be like, who are these get-off-my-lawn-old-people? This beef just doesn’t seem necessary. But that’s what’s happening. They all hate each other. They just argue on Twitter all day. It’s just super boring and depressing to everyone else in the world.
To play inside baseball for a second, are there doctrinal differences? What’s the story of the beef?
It’s such a can of worms. But basically, Anton LaVey founded the Church of Satan in 1966. Anton LaVey wrote a bunch of books in his life that the Church of Satan considers canon. And there are things in those books that are frankly, fucking ridiculous. Any modern person would read those books and think they were stupid. So many, many members of the Satanic Temple sort of grew up and had some exposure to LaVey’s writings, and some of what he wrote resonated deeply with them to the core, and then other parts of what he wrote made them cringe and made them wonder if they were Satanists.
Returning to the schism––not between the Church of Satan and the Satanic Temple, but between the Satanic Temple and Jex Blackmore––was there a reaction from Trump when she said that? Was there any fall out publicly?
No.
So, it was really an internal conflict. It didn’t make the news.
Yeah. It had a big impact within the Satanic community. Huge impact. Because many, many, many people came to the Satanic Temple because of Jex—because of her art, because of her point of view, because of her charisma. She brings a lot. She brought a lot to defining what the Satanic Temple was. It was really hard when she left. She took a lot of people with her.
There’s a lot of archival footage in the film — that old Adam and Eve clip, the Satan cartoons — can you tell me about digging through footage of biblical references, and how you wound up on those?
It was really fun. Each interview we did with different experts would send me down a different path. My editors were editing, doing all the really hard work of putting together a movie, and occasionally I would be able to go home and just spend the whole day watching Satanic Panic police-training videos, or another day might be 1960s and ‘70s horror movies. It was a fun process of watching tons and tons and tons of stuff, to find those tiny little nuggets we ended up using. We used such a small amount of it in the end compared to what we had.
Last question: I heard you joined the Satanic Temple. How’d that happen?
It never really occurred to me that this was going to be something that anyone cared about. And if I had thought it through, I probably wouldn’t have done it. It just causes problems for me now, because people want to be like, oh it’s made by a member! It’s propaganda! Getting a membership card to the Satanic Temple is a pretty low bar for supporting the organization. I sent them $20 and I got a card. I like my card and I feel very aligned with and allied to the work they do. But, like I said, if I had a time machine, I wouldn’t have done it. Because it’s the kind of thing now that seems a little more significant than it is."

A series of coordinated bomb blasts at churches and hotels across Sri Lanka killed more than 200 people and left hundreds more injured on Easter Sunday in one of the worst bouts of violence in the island nation since civil war ended a decade ago .
Four luxury hotels and three Catholic churches were among the highly populated areas that were targeted, according to the Associated Press. Officials told the AP that at least two of the blasts were carried out by suicide bombers.
Late Sunday, Sri Lanka’s Defense Minister Ruwan Wijewardena said authorities apprehended several people suspected of being involved in the attacks, according to the Associated Press. Three police officers were reportedly killed during operations to arrest the suspects.
A further improvised device was found at Bandaranaike International Airport by the Sri Lankan Air Force overnight Sunday. “A PVC pipe which was six feet in length containing explosives in it was discovered,” Air Force Spokesman Gihan Seneviratne told Sri Lanka’s main newspaper the Sunday Times .
Two senior intelligence officials told The Daily Beast that a Sri Lankan police official had alerted security officials in an advisory ten days ago about a threat on churches though it remains unseen what, if any, safety measures were taken to protect worshipers. The document, which has been reviewed by The Daily Beast is written in Sinhala, but is dated April 11 and clearly states in English in all caps, “Information of an alleged plan attack.”
Sri Lanka’s prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, said he had not been informed, underscoring tensions within the government, the New York Times reported. No one has yet claimed responsibility for the calculated attacks.
Both the Associated Press and AFP quoted local Sri Lankan intelligence officials that they had received warnings that “terrorist elements, including the radical Islamic organization NTJ, would carry out a suicide attack in certain churches during Easter.”
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement Sunday confirming that “several Americans” had been killed in the attacks. “While many details of the attacks are still emerging, we can confirm that several U.S. citizens were among those killed,” he wrote in a statement. “These vile attacks are a stark reminder of why the United States remains resolved in our fight to defeat terrorism.”
Officials told the Associated Press that at least nine foreigners are among those killed in Colombo, including two people who are dual citizens of the United States and the U.K. At least one American is among those reported missing, the news site said citing the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The dead include one Portuguese citizen and two U.K. citizens, the ministry said.
Chinese State Media has confirmed death of one of its citizens, per the AP. All of the foreigners were killed in attacks on hotels.
Emergency officials were still combing through the bomb sites for victims as night set in Sunday, but more tourists and foreign nationals are considered to be among the dead.
The New York Times reports that the deadliest attack occurred at 8:45 a.m. at the St. Sebastian Catholic Church in the city of Negombo about 20 miles from the capital city of Colombo. Survivors posted photos on social media and described seeing bodies blown to bits, with flesh splattered on the church walls.
“It was a river of blood,” a witness named N. A. Sumanapala, t0ld the Times . “The priest came out and he was covered in blood.”
The Catholic churches of St. Anthony’s Shrine in Colombo and the Zion Church in Batticaloa on the eastern side of the island were also bombed, according to reports.
Pope Francis, who visited the country four years ago to minister to the island nation’s Christian minority, expressed his condolences in his Easter Sunday mass in St. Peter’s Square in Rome. “I want to express my loving closeness to the Christian community, targeted while they were gathered in prayer, and all the victims of such cruel violence,” he said. “I entrust to the Lord all those who were tragically killed and pray for the injured and all those who are suffering as a result of this dramatic event.”
Local media showed images of damage at the Cinnamon Grand, Shangri-La and Kingsbury hotels. One report showed the second-floor restaurant of the Shangri-La gutted.
Sri Lanka has not seen such violence since the end of a 26-year civil war that ended over a decade ago. Then, rebels from the Tamil Tigers sought independence from the country’s Sinhala Buddhist majority.
Sri Lanka’s prime minsiter Ranil Wickremesinghe called for calm on Twitter. “I strongly condemn the cowardly attacks on our people today. I call upon all Sri Lankans during this tragic time to remain united and strong,” he wrote . “Please avoid propagating unverified reports and speculation. The government is taking immediate steps to contain this situation.”
The BBC reported that British nationals were among the injured. Prime Minister Theresa May called the attacks “truly appalling” adding “no one should ever have to practice their faith in fear”.
U.S. President Donald Trump also tweeted his condolences, “The United States offers heartfelt condolences to the great people of Sri Lanka. We stand ready to help!”
The attacks sent officials around the world into high gear taking precautions at churches in preparation for Easter celebrations.
A spokesperson for the NYPD confirmed to The Daily Beast that the department has ramped up domestic security measures in the wake of the attacks, and that officers will be visiting all houses of worship, with a focus Sunday on those offering Easter services.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report implicated the Russian government in a widespread campaign of hacking and political disinformation during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Russian state media is nonetheless trumpeting the reaction of U.S. conservatives to the report, which found that the Trump campaign was not complicit in those election-meddling efforts, as evidence of a broad anti-Russian conspiracy in the U.S. And it’s using at least one prominent American conservative voice to do so.
The Russian government-owned Rossiya 1 news channel recently broadcasted excerpts from Fox News primetime host Sean Hannity’s on-air monologue, which hammered “media hysteria” over the report and allegations of campaign “collusion” with the Russian government.
In its own editorializing , Rossiya 1 described the report as “bestseller about the absence of collusion between Trump and Russia,” and blamed the political press and U.S. intelligence agencies for “hounding Trump” over the allegations, according to a translation by journalist and Daily Beast contributor Julia Davis.
Though the report found no criminal conspiracy by the Trump campaign or any American to assist in Russian election-meddling efforts, it did confirm reporting that the Trump campaign solicited opposition research on 2016 rival Hillary Clinton from Russian nationals whom it understood were acting at the behest of that country’s government.
Mueller’s report also extensively documents allegedly criminal efforts by Kremlin actors to hack email accounts associated with prominent Democrats and sow political discord through social media disinformation campaigns.
In a separate Rossiya 1 segment this week, the channel described Mueller’s investigation as “an attempt to threaten the current government and influence U.S. foreign policy without offering any specific evidence.” READ THIS LIST"
Giuliani: ‘Nothing Wrong’ With Getting Political Dirt From Russians,www.thedailybeast.com,Lachlan.Markay@thedailybeast.com (Lachlan Markay),04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/giuliani-nothing-wrong-with-getting-political-dirt-from-russians,"SHOCKER Giuliani: ‘Nothing Wrong’ With Getting Political Dirt From Russians Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani says working with Russians on campaign dirt is a completely defensible political move. 04.21.19 10:46 AM ET REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun
The Trump campaign’s attempt to solicit political assistance from agents of the Russian government was perfectly legal, the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani suggested on Sunday, calling it was a completely defensible political move.
“There’s nothing wrong with taking information from Russians,” Giuliani told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview on Sunday morning, referring to a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting at which Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner solicited dirt on Hillary Clinton from people they believed to be acting at the behest of the Russian government.
Pressed by Tapper on whether it’s “okay” to use information stolen by adversarial foreign governments in the service of a presidential candidacy, Giuliani replied, “it depends on the stolen material.”
The investigative report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller released this week reviewed evidence that Don Jr. and Kushner may have violated campaign finance laws by enthusiastically taking that Trump Tower meeting in anticipation of receiving opposition research from two Russian attorneys with ties to the country’s government.
Mueller concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to charge anyone on the Trump campaign with soliciting an illegal in-kind contribution from a foreign national.
In the interview, Giuliani sought to shift the focus from whether the conduct was ethically defensible to whether it violated the letter of the law.
“We’re gonna get into morality? That’s not what prosecutors look at, morality,” Giuliani said. “This didn’t become an international scandal because of immorality. It became an international scandal because the president was accused of violating the law, falsely.”
The line of questioning was prompted by a statement this week from Mitt Romney, a senator from Utah and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. Romney said he was “appalled” that “fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia.”
Pressed on the question of morality, and whether such conduct was defensible even putting aside legal questions, Giuliani compared the acceptance of information stolen by a hostile foreign government to any other “immoral” conduct by a political campaign.
“I’d like to take a good look at Romney’s campaign and see if there were any immoral or unethical things done by the people working for him that he didn’t know about,” Giuliani said. “If there weren’t than it was the only campaign in history because he’s maybe holier than the holiest one.”"

KIEV—Exit polls show a television comedian backed by a shadowy billionaire has won Ukraine’s presidential elections with a crushing majority that may ultimately be greater than 70 percent.
This is no joke, as headline writers have been saying ever since the possibility of a victory by Volodomyr Zelenskiy over incumbent Petro Poroshenko loomed on the electoral horizon.
Ukraine is a country at war, shorn of territory by Russian covert and overt actions, with corruption a massive problem, and a hopeful but still fragile attachment to democracy.
There is little question that the vote for Zelenskiy (also spelled Zelensky) was a vote against the status quo—Poroshenko had failed to solve the key problem, the war, and was blamed for pervasive corruption. But what exactly people thought they were voting for remains unclear.
Zelenskiy is a clown whose humor is, to say the least, broad. Not long before election day, in one of his comedy skits that aired on Ukrainian television, Zelenskiy played a sex-obsessed middle-aged husband so overwhelmed by the sight of a popular young singer’s breasts that he dared not stand up. “It’s as if I am stabbed with a sword,” he told his wife, alluding to his unwanted erection. “All Zelenskiy wants to do is to unite Ukraine, make it stronger—cooler—and nothing can stop him.” — Yevgeny Koshevoy, fellow comedian and friend of the president-elect
Not so funny, really, but the now soon-to-be president of Ukraine does not care if his old jokes were a little crude and more than a little salty. He knows people love him.
The comedian’s fans have seen him on screen wearing the dress and scarf of a babushka’s outfit; they’ve seen him “drunk,” and terrified, and playing a variety of idiots. His signature role was playing a fool who wound up as president of the republic in the popular TV series, Servant of the People.
A few minutes before the exit polls were announced, Zelenskiy appeared before hundreds of journalists with music from the TV series in the background and a big smile on on his face that told us he knew he had won.
In real life Zelenskiy—his face stone serious—has promised “to break the old system” that he portrayed on TV. On Sunday night he kissed and thanked his wife, his parents and friends for their “strength.”
“If she knew what we would go through, she would not have married me,” he said about the mother of his two children, Olena Zelenskaya. Ukraine’s new first lady looked happy and above all relieved.
He addressed all post-Soviet countries with authoritarian regimes: “Look at us, everything is possible,” he said. Using the opportunity, the newly elected president encouraged dozens of reporters at the press center to join the information war against Russia.
In addition to his televised familiarity, 41-year-old Zelenskiy also has the appeal of youth at a time when Generation X politicians ahave been making their mark from Emmanuel Macron in France to Pete Buttigieg in the United States. And he played up his youthful style even as voters went to the polls.
The leader of “the old system,” President Poroshenko, wearing a white shirt and black suit, chose to begin election day with a trip to the Orthodox Church on what is, in the Orthodox calendar, Palm Sunday. Zelenskiy started his day pulling on a white T-shirt. He had a cup of coffee and his wife played some Eminem for him. Flashing smiles at the polling station, the comedian assured reporters: “Everything will be good.”
Everything about Zelenskiy irritated right-wing Ukrainian nationalists. “His behavior on election day shows how radically opposite he is from our leader, Poroshenko,” Sergiy Parkhomenko, an analyst with the right-wing To Protect Ukraine movement, told The Daily Beast on Sunday. “While the country is fighting a war with Russia, he is playful and full of jokes.”
Parkhomenko added ominously, “We are going to raise a new Maidan revolution if he makes a single step away from our course,” alluding to the uprising that brought down pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014. “He is weak, he does not have a religion, he does not have a nationality.”
On that last point, things are bit more complicated. Zelenskiy says that he is a Ukrainian of “Jewish origin,” which is also an unusual feature for a politician in Ukraine, a country where as many as 1.6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis during German occupation in World War II.
Today, Jews number only about 200,000, and anti-Semitism is far from over. Last year, the Jewish Committee reported more than one hundred cases.
“We have more than 180 Jewish politicians in power, but Zelenskiy is the first one among the leaders who is openly speaking about that,” Oleg Vishnevetskiy, the leader of Jewish community in the town of Uman, told The Daily Beast.
Thousands of Hasidic Jews arrive in Uman every year to visit the holy grave of Rebbe Nachman, and the community hopes that with Zelenskiy as the president, the environment for the community will grow more positive. “I hope that Zelenskiy will unite Ukraine and make peace between East and West, because so far we see Kiev allowing far-right marches with torches and think that the Germany of 1939 begins again,” said Vishnevetskiy.
Zelenskiy's television patron, billionaire Ihor Kolomoisky, currently lives in self-imposed exile in Israel. On the week of Passover, Uman Jews received boxes with matzah from Kolomoisky’s United Jewish Community. But many Ukrainians may not regard the oligarch’s influence as benign. As The Daily Beast reported earlier this month , the FBI in the United States is actively investigating Kolomoisky for a number of possible financial crimes. His lawyer has firmly declared that Kolomoisky is innocent.
Given the country’s history of anti-Semitism, the fact that such a powerful majority of Ukrainians voted for a Jewish candidate shows Vishnevetskiy's right-wing view is out there on the fringe one.
A former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, William Taylor, found it interesting Zelenskiy's Jewish heritage and preference for speaking Russian (another black mark for Ukraine’s nationalist right) has played such a minor role in the campaign.
“Ukraine has always been accused of being anti-Semitic and nationalistic in regard to the Ukrainian language and Russian language, and here is a guy who is Jewish, speaks Russian and he comes in first, so far,” Taylor, executive vice president of United States Institute of Peace, told The Daily Beast last week.
With passions high and political theater so unprecedented, the elections have been an exciting time for many Ukrainian voters, who sincerely want to have fully functioning democracy. According to the National Democratic Institute monitoring the election, up to 80 percent of people say that democracy is important to them—that is not a divisive issue.
A skeptical part of Ukraine’s electorate cannot imagine how Zelenskiy, an entertainer with no leadership or managerial experience political or otherwise, could manage to run a deeply corrupt country where millions are affected by the ongoing war against Moscow-led forces. But Zelenskiy seems to be sincere and fearless when he speaks about his feeling for the victims of the war.
“I am ready to kneel before every mother who did not see her son return from the frontlines,” he said during the presidential debates on Friday, and knelt down on the stage. Poroshenko followed him and also knelt in the most dramatic scene of this presidential race.
To many in Ukraine, living with daily news of soldiers killed in the east of the country, the two rivals kneeling down came across as a rare sign of reconciliation. But many continue to wonder: is Zelenskiy a really a Kremlin project?
“I don’t think so,” Ambassador Taylor told The Daily Beast. “I see no evidence that he is; he seems to be the guy who wants to unite Ukraine to make it strong.”
In an exclusive interview with The Daily Beast, Zelenskiy’s close friend and fellow comedian at Studio Quarter-95, Yevgeny Koshevoy, said the presidential campaign was “painful” to watch.
“It is just unbearable to face so many accusations. For three months I have been reading disparaging nonsense, lies about Zelenskiy, about our team being ‘the Kremlin’s prostitutes,’ ‘the Kremlin’s lapdogs,’” Koshevoy told The Daily Beast. “Pro-Poroshenko media groups attack us and never say that Russia has opened a criminal case against Zelenskiy.”
That probably is because it’s not at all the Kremlin connection that Zelinsky’s critics were looking for.
In 2015 Russia’s Investigative Committee opened a criminal case against Zelenskiy for financing “punishment battalions fighting against Russian speaking population” in eastern regions of Ukrainian. If charged, Zelenskiy could be facing up to 20 years of jail in Russia.
After so many years living the life of a TV star performing in front of thousands, Koshevoy found suffering a kind of sympathetic stage fight as he watched his best friend take on the new role of a serious presidential candidate.
We Zelenskiy presented his campaign team on national television, said Koshevoy, “I was standing by the TV set, drinking, terrified that some journalist would insult him.”
Koshevoy met Zelenskiy in 2002, and appreciates how tough he can be.
“Once he got terribly sick with salmonella from a bad egg but still came out on stage to perform a concert—we carried him to the stage,” Koshevoy recalled.
When the war began in Donbas, eastern Ukraine, in the spring of 2014 , Zelenskiy, Koshevoy and other members of the Studio Quarter-95 troupe traveled around the front line. They performed in front of the soldiers fresh from combat. “People told us that they were smiling at our jokes—smiling for the first time in weeks—that night,” Koshevoy remembered.
“All Zelenskiy wants to do is to unite Ukraine, make it stronger—cooler—and nothing can stop him—he is stubborn, believe me.” READ THIS LIST"
"Inside Kanye West’s Coachella Sunday Service: A Big, Mesmerizing, ‘Religious’ Grift",www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-kanye-wests-coachella-sunday-service-a-big-mesmerizing-religious-grift,"ULTRALIGHT BEAM Inside Kanye West’s Coachella Sunday Service: A Big, Mesmerizing, ‘Religious’ Grift On Easter Sunday, the MAGA artist delivered a spellbinding make-up performance at Coachella—while hawking $225 sweatshirts he called “Church Clothes.” 04.21.19 6:33 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast / Photos via Twitter
On Easter Sunday morning, Kanye West captivated Coachella with his attempt to rise from the depths of cultural cancellation . West brought his “Sunday Service,” previously reserved for elite worshippers, friends and family, to the masses. The rapper’s recent turn toward outspoken faith hints at his desire for redemption, or at the very least a search for community and meaning in the wake of a public fall from grace.
West is an inarguably talented and influential artist, but he’s an increasingly controversial one.
Many fans lost their faith after West repeatedly, insistently expressed his support for Donald Trump. In addition to sporting a telltale red MAGA hat, West has also visited the president and defended him against criticism. The rapper’s previously beloved Twitter feed has seemingly been converted into a tool for generating backlash, with posts shouting out far-right activist Candace Owens and repping “Trump all day.”
West’s decision to bring his Sunday Service to Indio, California, much like his increased role on his wife’s reality show Keeping Up With the Kardashians , reads like image repair. The rapper is understandably trying to regain control over his own narrative, counteracting bad press with good vibes. Then again, West’s holy performance didn’t start out too auspiciously; after Coachella promoter Goldenvoice reportedly refused to build Kanye a “giant dome” for his headlining set, West initially pulled out of the event. He was, however, willing to bring an elevated version of his star-studded, invite-only worship sessions to the festival.
Anyone who watched the Easter Sunday Service via Coachella’s livestream or in person—fans lined up hours in advance for the 9 a.m. PT proceedings—would agree that this novel event was a departure from the average Coachella set. Coming off of the release of Beyoncé’s Homecoming , a concert film about Bey’s instantly iconic Coachella performance, it was hard to ignore the Sunday Service’s palpable chill. West took his time making an entrance, finally arriving after about 45 minutes of intro.
Of course, this being a Kanye West production, the set up itself was striking. Lines and lines of singers snaked through the grassy hillside terrain, decked out in a uniform of muted, flowing garments. Nothing if not consistent in his vision, West returned to one of his favorite visuals: an assemblage of people standing very still and slightly apart for a long period of time, wearing earth tones. Swap out the tunics for elevated Spanx and it would’ve looked like a Yeezy fashion show . A full band grooved on, the music peppered with vocal harmonies and Easter-appropriate exaltations.
When Kanye finally did arrive, he leisurely greeted his musicians and then joined his VIPs, more or less taking a back seat (dancing, nodding his head, playing a little bit of piano) for the majority of the show. And while the audience may have been hoping for more Kanye West, they were left in capable hands as the phalanx of gospel singers seamlessly bridged the spiritual and secular divide, riffing West tracks into church songs.
In addition to Jesus, the set also paid homage to musical greats like The Clark Sisters, Otis Redding, and Stevie Wonder. While a good deal of planning and talent clearly went into executing these musical transitions, the overall effect was loose and comfortable. Singers vocalized, musicians meandered, and the audience was encouraged to participate. At some points West appeared to be directing on the fly, prompting the choir with lyrics or reconfiguring the group on a whim. Whether you come away from Sunday Service crediting Kanye with artfully curating powerful, informal vibes or accusing him of over-relying on filler and spontaneity might depend on how Christian you’re feeling today.
Luckily, a handful of A-Listers delivered some big, social media-worthy moments for the occasionally restless-seeming crowd (yes, the Kardashians were in attendance, and yes, Kylie and Travis Scott did engage in PDA). Teyana Taylor stole the show with her performance of “Never Would Have Made It,” complete with stunning choreography and hairography. Taylor is a gift, and we do not appreciate her enough! DMX slowed things down with a partially-rhyming prayer, and Chance the Rapper fully committed to his verse on “Ultralight Beam.” And of course, North West made multiple appearances, dancing along to the music and at one point even taking the mic.
While West seemed content with his role as aspiring megachurch hype man, he did deign to rap a few songs, and even debuted a new track: “Water” with Ty Dolla $ign. His rendition of “Jesus Walks” stood out as a testament to West’s power, not to mention his legacy—there’s still nothing quite like it. West was so moved by his own show that he broke down at one point, and had to be comforted by DMX, Kid Cudi and Chance.
Hours of dancing, singing and praising later, as the service came to an end, it appeared obvious that West had ascended to some higher plane, delivering a genuinely unique and profound experience (and at Coachella, no less). But for the cynics among us, there’s still cause for concern—namely, the expensive new merchandise that West has already been called out for selling at his overtly religious service.
According to photos from the Coachella performance, a tent marked “Church Clothes” offered sweatshirts from $165 to $225, $70 shirts and $50 socks. The merchandise reads “Trust God,” “Jesus Walks,” “Sunday Service,” and “Holy Spirit.” In light of a brewing social-media backlash, it looks like West’s decision to sell outrageously priced pseudo-religious garb at his Sunday Service has already undermined his nascent redemption."

The group’s Facebook page advertises the event, claiming that “Bishop Mark Grenon will be leading the seminar and introducing attendees to Chlorine Dioxide Therapy, otherwise known as MMS.” The post asks participants for “donations” of $450 per person; $800 for couples; and $400 for returning seminar students. The FDA has warned participants not to attend. “Consumers who have MMS should stop using it immediately and throw it away,” a spokesman for the FDA told the Guardian . “The FDA continues to advise consumers about the dangers of Miracle Mineral Solution and the agency has issued warnings to consumers over the past decade.” The FDA did not confirm whether they would alert law enforcement to stop the ceremony.

Video of Florida police officers slamming a 15-year-old black boy’s head into the pavement during a trespassing arrest went viral this weekend, sparking outrage from celebrities like Lebron James and Steve Kerr—but one officer involved claims the teen was being “aggressive” and that punching him in the head was nothing more than a “distractionary technique.”
Footage of the encounter shared on social media with the hashtag #JusticeForLucca appears to show the teen, who has been referred to both as “Lucca” and “Delucca” online, reaching down to pick something up off the ground outside a McDonald’s in Tamarac, Florida, while Broward County Sheriff’s deputies handcuff another teen on the ground.
An officer turned around and confronted Lucca, then pepper sprayed him in the face. As Lucca turned and tried to walk away, the officer grabbed him by the shoulders and slammed him to the ground.
Footage from video taken at a different angle shows another officer jumping on the teen after he’s been pushed to the ground. The officer repeatedly slammed the boy’s head into the pavement, before punching him once in the head. The teen then lay motionless, one arm sticking out, while bystanders screamed “what are you doing?” and “he’s bleeding!”
Photos taken after the encounter show the lower right side of the teen’s face drenched in blood.
Broward County Mayor Mark Bogan tweeted Friday that the officer’s conduct was “outrageous & unacceptable,” adding: “The officer who jumped the student, punched & banged his head should be fired.”
The Broward County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment.
Video of the encounter went viral over the weekend, after celebrities like LeBron James, Steve Kerr, and David Hogg condemned the officers involved. “So wrong!! Hurts me to my soul!!” James wrote on Twitter . “To think that could be my sons. Scary times man.”
“What the hell is wrong with our country?” Kerr wrote . “This is insane yet routine. So demoralizing.”
“It’s interesting how everyone in Parkland and Broward was calling out local law enforcement a couple of months ago,” wrote David Hogg , a survivor of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in nearby Parkland. “But now the black and brown youth are being brutally assaulted in school by the same police 15 min away. COMPLETE silence…”
In the aftermath of the attack, Sheriff Gregory Tony promised a “thorough investigation” of the matter in a video press release . He also announced that one of the officers involved, Christopher Krickovich, would be placed on administrative leave for use of force.
In an arrest warrant affidavit cited by BuzzFeed News, Krickovich offered his side of the story. He wrote that students often fought in the plaza after school, and that the day before the arrest, there had been a large fight that resulted in damage to an innocent bystander’s property.
After spotting a fight on Thursday, Krickovich wrote, he and other officers saw a teen trespassing who had been involved in the previous day’s activity. The student was placed in custody “without incident”—but when that teen’s cell phone fell during the arrest, Lucca allegedly bent down to pick it up.
After Sgt. Greg LaCerra told Lucca to stay back, Krickovich claims, the teen “took an aggressive stance” towards the officer, and “bladed his body and began clenching his fists.” After an officer pepper sprayed the teen and forced him to the ground, Krickovich said he jumped on the boy and “pushed down [...] to ensure my full weight was on his person so he could not attempt to take flight or fight us.”
“Again, the three of us were outnumbered by the large group of students who were yelling, threatening us, and surrounding us,” Krickovich wrote. “I had to act quickly, fearing I would get struck or having a student potentially grab weapons off my belt or vest.”
After the teen moved his right arm under his head to protect his face from getting slammed into the pavement, Krickovich added, “I struck [him] in the right side of his head with a closed fist as a distractionary technique to free his right hand.”
During a pre-planned meeting with the Broward County Black Elected Officials group on Saturday, Sheriff Tony attempted to quell the outcry.
“That’s the most electrifying and dangerous situation for a law enforcement administrator to handle,” Tony said. “Any time a white deputy is involved in contact with using force on a black youth, this thing blows up.”
He added that despite the furor against the officers, he can’t fire them. “There’s been a large cry of just go out and fire them. Just get rid of them,” he said. “You all know it doesn't work like that. It's going to be done the right way.” READ THIS LIST"
Nathan Lane Cleans Up Broadway’s Biggest Pile of Dead Bodies in ‘Gary: a Sequel to Titus Andronicus’,www.thedailybeast.com,tim.teeman@thedailybeast.com (Tim Teeman),04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/gary-a-sequel-to-titus-andronicus-nathan-lane-cleans-up-broadways-biggest-pile-of-dead-bodies,"Travel CLASSIC Nathan Lane Cleans Up Broadway’s Biggest Pile of Dead Bodies in ‘Gary: a Sequel to Titus Andronicus’ In ‘Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus,’ Taylor Mac imagines what happened next after Shakespeare’s tragedy: an epic clean-up of blood and body parts, and a call for resistance. 04.21.19 8:00 PM ET Courtesy Julieta Cervantes
Even before the lushly designed curtain rises on Taylor Mac’s Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus , which opens Sunday night on Broadway (at the Booth Theatre, to Aug. 4), the fluids start shooting forth.
A woman appears and begins to spurt blood from her slashed neck. The blood flies out sporadically, and this looks a little precarious if you are in the front two rows. The woman, inevitably raspy of voice given her injury, muses on the nature of sequels and revenge.
Then the curtain rises on one of the great stage designs of this Broadway season. The sight of hundreds of human bodies immediately confronts the audience. They are piled right in front of us; life-size stuffed mannequins, with red splodges on them signifying wounds. Legs and arms and faces and heads and necks, all in a horrific, mad, limb-clashing, mashing pile-up.
The astonishing sight, designed by Santo Loquasto , looks as ridiculous as it does horrific. This is what playwright and performer Taylor Mac imagines as what happened after the end of Shakespeare’s bloody revenge tragedy Titus Andronicus . (Full disclosure: One of the play’s producers is Barry Diller, chairman of IAC, The Daily Beast’s parent company.)
Mac is most famous for the acclaimed 24-Decade History of Popular Music , in which, in a variety of guises, he performed one hour of music (really, spectacle) for each decade from 1776 to 2016 . In Gary he imagines what the purpose of art can be in a desecrated society.
In this banqueting hall turned charnel house, there is the prosaically named Gary (Nathan Lane), a former clown now turned laborer, here to do some tidying up of bodies before the inauguration of a new leader the next day. “Bit more of them than I was expecting,” he says of the bodies. His voice is Cockney. Lane—orbiting in his brilliant way from shy to showman; naughty schoolboy to moral fulcrum—at first seems like a mischief-maker, bored on the job and up for fun.
The fourth wall stays permeable throughout; the actors stare out at us, puzzled at our applause. When Janice (Kristine Nielsen) enters, she responds to the applause with a “Yeah, yeah, yeah how ’bout a raise?” The modern world and classical world are linguistic neighbors here.
The job is miserable, one of funneling out fluids and gases out of bodies, which Lane makes into a gross-out mini-ballet, tapping gas out of a body like it’s a musical instrument.
The play, directed with an anarchic set of energies by George C. Wolfe, is a delirious collision of high and low, with he and Nielsen clambering over bodies, being careful not to mix up the poop and blood extraction tubes, and fishing out intestines from bodies. All we can see are men. The women and children are left covered.
Later, Gary wonders if moving all the men’s inert penises right to left could end all tragedy. It’s worth a try.
Echoes of Shakespeare’s original play drift in. Janice seems to have been in love with horribly mutilated Lavinia. Julie White’s Carol, whom we saw at the beginning, reappears, feverishly confessing her sense of culpability over the death of a “black baby” that she should have prevented. White is magnificently loopy, playing to the audience, smashing the fourth wall with all manner of mugging.
All of Gary is performed in a state of heightened hysteria, with bodies being walked over, thrown about, and—in the case of one handsome dead hunk—molested by Gary. This Broadway season’s most surreal tea party is set in motion, with a pie made of body parts; yes, it suddenly feels very Sweeney Todd .
Janice, whom Nielsen plays with a doughty impatience, is at first furious with the lack of respect shown to the bodies, until she emerges from the heap of bodies wearing golden robes and Saturnius’ crown. This transformation changes her; we soon realize, via beautiful soliloquy, the depth of her love for Lavinia.
Profundity and fart gags jumble into each other in Gary . Lane’s character is frustrated; he wants something else; to create a “fooling,” which he describes “an onslaught of ingenuity that’s a transformation of the calamity we got here. A sort of theatrical revenge on the Andronicus revenge. A comedy revenge to end all revenge. Well, not just a comedy. A sorta folly. No, a spectacle. Or a comedy folly that is a spectacle.”
Just wait to see his ambition achieved: Using a system of pulleys and ingenuity, the stage becomes a riot of movements and explosions, as if Busby Berkeley and H.G. Wells were on an acid-influenced mission in the Underworld. Real dancers-as-dead-bodies appear, a surprise on the night we were told later as we were handed their names: Collin Baja, Tom Berklund, Tislarm Bouie, Mark Junek, and Matty Oaks. “Right now, in our political system, we’re living in a kind of revenge tragedy. We’re trapped in a cycle where conflict is created and escalated and then created again; we’re chasing sensation.” — Taylor Mac
If this sounds a huge surreal flight of fancy, Mac has talked before about the inspiration of the works of Charles Ludlam and the Ridiculous Theatrical Company. “I even have Gary say, ‘We’ve got to make this ridiculous!’” Mac told The New Yorker .
Gary is intended to have a heavy Trumpian resonance. “Right now, in our political system, we’re living in a kind of revenge tragedy,” Mac told The New Yorker . “We’re trapped in a cycle where conflict is created and escalated and then created again; we’re chasing sensation.”
As ridiculous it is, Gary is also about the importance of art, the insistence upon it as a mode of resistance to the death and corruption literally piled up around Lane’s character.
Janice’s fervent cleaning, her admonishment of Gary for being lackadaisical, eventually leads him to ask her why she is so focused on cleaning, “making it all nice and clean and great, again, even though it was never really nice and clean and great in the first place, because the massacre of it was always floating about, just under the surface, and all you’ve done is make it seem pleasant for the people making the mess.”
Gary is a farce, a piece of messy circus whose many tones and shades will likely divide audiences and critics. But there is nothing like it on Broadway, and that is to be welcomed. It is an argument for art, and a passionate call for resistance—a pie of clashing ingredients just as is served for tea in the play. All three characters make their own brave moves at the end to effect some kind of change.
The most horrific sound we hear come when the two women open the doors to hear the baying shouts and screams of the mob. Inside the room, as well as all the death, we are left with Gary's mad piece of art—and a sign of new life; and Gary has gone from slacker clown to committed freedom fighter. READ THIS LIST"
Scouted: The 6 Women’s Sneakers That Will Elevate Your Everyday Style,www.thedailybeast.com,jillian.lucas@thedailybeast.com (Jillian Lucas),04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-nicest-womens-sneakers-for-everyday-wear,"Scouted By The Beast
As someone who wears sneakers several times a week, finding the right pair was a process. I needed sneakers that would get me through my 15-minute walk from the subway each morning but that didn’t look like I was getting ready for eighth grade P.E. class.
Sneakers don’t have to just be the “I want to be comfortable” option. They can take a dressy look and make it more fashionably-casual. They can streamline your outfit into something that feels more you. But not all sneakers are created the same. When it comes to upgrading your sneakers, look for ones that are made from high-quality materials like leather and cotton, and don’t be afraid to break them in.

The Perforated Royale , $179 from Greats: I love my Greats Royales. Every time I wear them, I get compliments. They’re versatile but still statement-making. It took a little while to break them in, but now I find them incredibly comfortable and easy to pair with anything, from jeans to dresses. They’re made from Italian leather and will keep your feet looking fresh every time you wear them.
Common Projects Achilles , $415 from Barney’s New York: There’s a reason that the Common Projects Achilles is one of the most-worn shoes right now. The Italian leather, padded tongue, rubber sole, and minimalist style combines into the perfect go-anywhere, do-anything sneaker. They look good with trousers to help liven up a suit but can be paired with jeans to have a great weekend look, too.
Veja V-10 Sneakers , $150 from Madewell: These Parisian sneakers have a sustainable backbone, including an organic cotton lining and soles crafted from wild Amazonian rubber. The leather will soften and you’ll be left with a sneaker that feels custom-fit to your foot while still looking sleek and light.
The Sempre , $198 from M.Gemi: The newest Sempre shoe is M.Gemi’s first unisex style. A soft, leather upper is sturdy but flexible enough to be packed in a carry-on. It comes in five different styles and its low profile allows you to pair it with any length pant. The monotone laces make this a sleek style that is an elevation from your everyday sneaker.
Saxon Leather Sneaker , $275 from Vince: Vince is all about “clean lines and uncomplicated silhouettes” and their sneakers show it. The Saxon Leather Sneakers give you a minimalist design, making them look more like a loafer than a true sneaker. It has a slightly pointed toe, adding a little bit more dressiness to an otherwise casual shoe.
Axel Arigato Platform Detailed Sneakers , $245 from Shopbop: These add a little bit of a platform into the mix, perfect for someone (like me) who could use any help they can get in the height department. The pop of red is a nice touch to allow you to pair them with simple outfits like a t-shirt and jeans. They’re made in Portugal and have a sturdy cowhide upper and suede lining to keep your feet comfortable all day.

Black Parishioners in Louisiana Pray on Easter for Alleged Racist Who Burned Down Their Church,www.thedailybeast.com,Laura Bassett,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/louisiana-church-fires-black-parishioners-pray-for-holden-matthews-accused-of-burning-down-church-in-hate-crime,"FORGIVENESS Black Parishioners in Louisiana Pray on Easter for Alleged Racist Who Burned Down Their Church Sunday was full of grief and triumph for Greater Union Baptist Church, which authorities say was attacked by a white man who targeted them because of their race. 04.21.19 5:24 PM ET Glenna Gordon
OPELOUSAS, Louisiana—Decked out in vibrant pink and yellow dresses and suits and elaborate hats, the all-black congregation of the Greater Union Baptist Church packed into a plain, windowless room in a private Masonic lodge with plastic folding chairs Sunday morning to hold their Easter service.
They’ve been gathering in this cramped donated space since April 2, when their historic church was burned to the ground in a series of alleged suspected hate crimes that destroyed three black churches over nine days.
Spirits were high, despite the circumstances. The gospel choir sang, and the churchgoers danced and hollered and praised exuberantly, as if nothing were different. Occasionally, bits of grief broke through: A woman burst into tears and started sobbing into her lap, and people passed a box of tissues down the row and rubbed her back until she recovered. Otherwise, the mood felt something like triumph.
Reverend Harry Richard addressed the fire many times in his sermon. He praised the congregation for handling the tragedy so gracefully amid all the media attention, and for resisting angry reactions. He urged continued empathy and prayers for the suspect in police custody, a 21-year-old white man named Holden Matthews , and his family.
“Holden and his parents, I think about what they must have been going through,” he said. “I would hate for that to have been my son. How would I feel? I put myself in his place. How would I feel if it was my son? Can you imagine that mother and that father waking up that morning and realizing it was their son that did this? Can you feel the heartbreak?”
“Don't ever give up on love,” he continued. “I don't care what the world might do to you. You never give up on love.”
The loss of this church, more than 100 years old, felt like the death of a close family member to many of the people who grew up in it. Monica Guidry Harris, 56, said her mother and father renewed their vows inside those walls every single year for 73 years in a row until they both passed away in the fall, two months apart. They’re buried together in a grave behind the now-burned church. The night of the blaze, Harris received a frantic call from one of her 12 siblings at 2:30 in the morning, and she jumped out of bed to drive to the scene. “I’m glad Mama and Daddy weren’t here to see the church burn.” — Celina Guidry Richard
“The only thing I could see in my mind was my dad with a waterhose, trying to put the fire out,” she said. “He only had a second grade education. He lived, breathed, everything this church. He used to cut the grass here.”
Several of the Guidry siblings wore matching pins Sunday morning with a picture of their parents on it. “I’m glad Mama and Daddy weren’t here to see the church burn,” said Celina Guidry Richard, 69.
The congregation is hesitant to talk about race or racism with regard to the fire, despite the long, painful history of white supremacists burning black churches in the Deep South. St. Landry Parish, the heart of Cajun country in Louisiana, is 41 percent black and 56 percent white. I grew up here, about five miles from Greater Union. The parish is still fairly segregated — there are black neighborhoods and white neighborhoods, black schools and white schools — but the races have interacted peacefully here for decades. Any tension or strife, like most things in the bayou, swims stealthily beneath the surface.
The older members of the church are keen to keep it that way by treating Matthews’ crime as if it were just an unfortunate anomaly, despite the mounting evidence that he was motivated by racism.
“He could have very well been a black man or a Mexican, it didn't matter to me to that he was white,” said Harris. “He’s 21 years old, what does he know about life? He just ruined the rest of his life. We just started praying for him, that God takes pity on him and opens up his heart, and that way he'll have somewhere to go in his afterlife.”
“It was almost a relief for the black community that it wasn't a black kid,” said Florence Guidry, another of the seven sisters. “We were scared, because we didn't know if it was one ours, one of our grandkids.”
I asked James Vaughn, 75, if the incident brought back memories of similar hate crimes from the civil rights era. “No, it didn’t come back to me,” he said. “The poor child was sick, that's the way I look at it. All you can do is pray for him.”
Some of the younger church members, who didn’t grow up watching black churches burn, are having a much harder time coping with the incident. Brandon Prince, 26, was the only person who answered affirmatively when I asked if he was angry.
“A little,” he said, holding back tears. “I can’t say that I’m not. But it’s like the pastor said: The church isn’t the building. The church is us.”
After their Easter service, at the pile of ash and rubble where the old church used to be, Prince’s mother held him as he sobbed into her chest. Other members carefully walked through the charred debris, picking out half-burned Bible pages and mementos to take home and preserve.
They’ll rebuild the church soon, bigger and better: A GoFundMe page for the three churches has raised over $2 millio n in the past week, thanks to promotion from celebrities and journalists. The three churches will split the money evenly for rebuilding efforts. Richard, who serves as the secretary for Greater Union, says the whole incident may leave them in a better place than they were before.
“Maybe in some weird way or a blessed way, God had a hand,” she said. “I feel sorry for Holden. He thought destroying a building would destroy our faith and ambition to be better, and he didn’t. All he did was motivate us.”

Is Sri Lanka Easter Massacre a Bid to Revive Global Holy War?,www.thedailybeast.com,christopher.dickey@thedailybeast.com (Christopher Dickey),04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-sri-lanka-easter-massacre-a-bid-to-revive-global-holy-war,"GLOBAL THREAT Is Sri Lanka Easter Massacre a Bid to Revive Global Holy War? No matter who carried out the coordinated massacre at churches and hotels in Sri Lanka, the shock waves will be felt near and far. STR/Getty
This analysis updated 1t 10:15 a.m. EDT, April 22, 2019.
NEW YORK—“It’s really a shame it had to come to this,” said an NYPD counterterrorism officer who was posted Sunday morning outside a Catholic church on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. Inside, the pews were filled with the faithful at Easter mass.
I asked her if she and her colleague were there because hundreds of people were killed hours earlier, halfway around the world, at Easter services in Sri Lanka . No, she said, this deployment in New York was scheduled months ago, but she understood the question perfectly well.
Christian churches, along with Jewish synagogues, Buddhist shrines, and Shiite Muslim mosques have been prime targets for violent jihadists, whether from the so-called Islamic State, al Qaeda, or groups or individuals that most of the world has never heard of.
The terrorists are on the fringe of their own faith, claiming anyone who does not believe exactly as they do deserves to die in their “holy war” against “Crusaders” and Jews, infidels and apostates. So wide do they cast their net of hatred that they can justify killing almost anyone, and the softer the target, in many respects, the better.
Especially from the perspective of ISIS and those it inspires, places of worship have the advantage of great symbolism and virtually no defenses. And an attack in one part of the world can lead to attacks elsewhere. If the death toll is high enough—which is certainly the case with the coordinated bombings in Sri Lanka—the shock will reverberate around the globe.
Notwithstanding the boasting of President Donald Trump, the war waged by such terrorists is far from over, and that is well understood by anyone in counterterror ops, which is why police would have been stationed outside places of worship in New York City anyway. Such are the facts of life and death in the 21st century.
“Happy Easter,” said the policewoman on the Upper East Side.
The killers in Sri Lanka attacked five-star hotels as well as churches, killing at least 290 people and wounding many hundreds. Several Americans are believed to be among the dead and injured. And while the question of what group, exactly, is behind the bombings remains unclear, the timing, the context, and news reports that Sri Lankan security warned of imminent jihadist attacks on churches, strongly suggest the slaughter was the work of Muslim extremists.
The French news agency AFP reported that Sri Lankan Police Chief Pujuth Jayasundara issued an intelligence alert to top officers 10 days earlier, warning that suicide bombers planned to hit ""prominent churches.""
According to the report, the alert said, ""A foreign intelligence agency has reported that the NTJ [National Thowheeth Jama'ath] is planning to carry out suicide attacks targeting prominent churches as well as the Indian high commission in Colombo.""
On Monday, after arresting dozens of people, the Sri Lankan government continued to focus attention on the NTJ and apologized for its abject failure to act on the earlier warning. Initial investigations suggest all the suicide bombers were locals. But foreign involvement is suspected as well.
The NTJ was accused of vandalizing Buddhist statues last year, but has never carried out any terrorist acts remotely as murderous and sophisticated as the coordinated bombings on Sunday. It does not figure on the State Department’s list of major terrorist organizations .
Sri Lanka also has a long history of violence by the former separatist organization Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which was not a Muslim organization at all, but whose “Black Tigers” were some of the first and most effective suicide bombers on the world scene. One of them successfully murdered former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. The LTTE finally was crushed by Sri Lankan government forces in 2009.
Rita Katz, director of the SITE Intelligence Group, which closely monitors jihadist chat and communiques, noted Sunday in an extended thread on Twitter that ISIS supporters were quick to celebrate the Sri Lanka attacks as revenge for the military campaign that finally ended its open control of territory in Iraq and Syria, and for the massacre at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, last month.
CNN's Barbara Starr reported Monday that according to a U.S. official ""initial intelligence are that the group responsible for the attacks in Sri Lanka was inspired by ISIS.""
The extent of coordination and the materiel for the bombings that has been discovered, including multiple detonators, also suggests foreign involvement. But the Tamil Tiger history shows the expertise for building suicide bombs is well established on the island.
Katz noted that no organization has claimed the operation, there have been fighters from Sri Lanka mentioned in ISIS ranks, and Sri Lanka in any case would be “easily accessible” for its supporters in the region. Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines and Indonesia, have “seen a surge of central-coordinated ISIS activity” in what it dubs its “East Asia Province.”
“Furthermore,” Katz wrote, “today’s bombings, albeit far more deadly, mirror January 2019 bombings” that targeted a Catholic Church in the Philippines, which ISIS formally claimed. She suggested that ISIS channels, “posting rampantly” about Sri Lanka, were paving the way for the organization to claim responsibility. Katz said that while the Easter Sunday slaughter may be framed as revenge for the New Zealand atrocity committed by a radical white nationalist, it was most likely planned long before.
Of course claims do not necessarily reflect reality, and in any case need to be studied carefully. A group aligned with ISIS, the Noor al-Tawhid Foundation, claimed the fire that ravaged the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris last Monday was not the work of jihadists, who had nothing to do with the tragic accidental blaze, but was the work of Allah: “divine punishment” for destruction of the mosque in Baghuz, the last ISIS redoubt to fall in Syria.
Extremists believe what they want to believe, always drawing inspiration from their own supposed victimization, and calling for “revenge” against those they hope to slaughter. Whoever finally is held responsible for the murders in Sri Lanka, and several arrests reportedly have been made, there is little question the group will claim it had no choice, and that will be the word spread to followers and faithful around the world, inspiring new attacks that may come much closer to home. ... It’s really a shame it has come to this. READ THIS LIST"

Donald Trump has demanded the capture of the Ugandan kidnappers who snatched an American tourist and demanded a $500,000 ransom. Kimberly Sue Endicott, a tourist from Costa Mesa, California, was kidnapped at gunpoint along with her tour guide on a safari last week and both were rescued alive Sunday. However, her kidnappers escaped. Endicott will be turned over to the U.S. ambassador Monday, according to Ugandan police, but it's unclear whether the ransom was paid. Tweeting Monday morning, Trump threatened that Uganda's tourism industry will suffer unless they swiftly capture the kidnappers. He wrote: “Uganda must find the kidnappers of the American Tourist and guide before people will feel safe in going there.

Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA), the 40-year-old veteran who is in his third term in Congress, is running for president.
“Whether it’s appointing a Cabinet member, negotiating a treaty, or signing an executive order, I will always uphold America’s values,” Moulton said in his announcement video. “I’m running because we have to beat Donald Trump, and I want us to beat Donald Trump because I love this country. We’ve never been a country that gets everything right. But we’re a country that, at our best, thinks that we might. I’d be honored if you’d join me in this mission.”
After spending time in early-voting states over the past few months, he announced his candidacy on Good Morning America , officially becoming the 20th candidate to compete for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
His campaign will emphasize organizing young people and veterans on the ground and aides to Moulton say they’ve heard positive receptions to a younger candidate who can focus on issues of national security, defense, and foreign policy in contrast to President Trump.
Moulton has recently spent time in early-voting states and his Serve America PAC contributed more than $4 million to candidates in the 2018 cycle, with staff on the ground working to flip almost two dozen House seats.
In the run-up to his announcement, Moulton has given a speech on foreign policy, including arms control and re-examining NATO , called for the creation of a Federal Green Jobs Corps and an electoral reform plan and said both the Electoral College and the Senate filibuster should be abolished .
Moulton was heavily criticized for his efforts to keep House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) from leading the party after Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives last year, protestations that included angry constituents at a town-hall meeting and potential primary challengers . Moulton eventually backed her speakership after coming to a deal that included term limits for the leadership positions of the House’s top Democrats. More recently, Moulton has said Pelosi has done a good job in her role.
One of his other competitors in the 2020 race, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH), also led the charge for new leadership and previously challenged Pelosi for the position of minority leader in 2016. When that vote was taken, another 2020 contender, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) supported Ryan .
Following the formal launch of his campaign, Moulton will participate in an aggressive media tour, including an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, a must-stop for Democratic presidential aspirants as of late. And throughout the rest of the week, he’ll be heading back to early-voting states for campaign events.
The number of candidates is not expected to remain at 20 for long, as former Vice President Joe Biden is poised to enter the race this week as well. READ THIS LIST"
Greece to Demand $300 Billion in World War II Reparations From Germany - The Daily Beast,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/greece-to-demand-dollar300-billion-in-world-war-ii-reparations-from-germany,"16 hours ago Greece to Demand $300 Billion in World War II Reparations From Germany
Greece’s parliament has voted to demand $300 billion from Germany in reparations for the destruction suffered during World War II, The Guardian reports Sunday. The demand comes after the country conducted a parliamentary inquiry into Germany’s conduct toward Greece throughout the war, which included the slaughter of tens of thousands of people between 1941 and 1944 as the nation pushed back against Nazi forces. The Guardian reports that by the end of German occupation, nearly 300,000 people were dead from famine alone. The $300 billion figure includes approximately $11 billion for an interest-free “occupation loan,” and about $288 billion for damage Greece suffered during the war. Germany has long argued that it sufficiently paid reparations when it gave Athens 115 million Deutsche Marks in 1960; Greek officials disagree. “It is an open issue that must be resolved,” Greece’s deputy foreign minister, Markos Bolaris, told the paper.

Fourteen bus passengers have been shot dead in Pakistan after gunmen ambushed the vehicle in what prime minister Imran Khan has condemned as “an act of terror.” The assailants reportedly boarded the bus and demanded the passengers hand over their identity cards before they were forced out onto the highway and massacred. Local official Jehangir Dashti told the Associated Press it was unclear who was behind the killings, but said “dozens of gunmen” were involved in the attack. “In this tragic incident, 14 passengers were forced off the bus, they were lined up in a nearby open area and killed by the terrorists,” Dashti said. Khan ordered authorities “to make every possible effort to identify and to bring the perpetrators of the barbaric act to justice.” Separatists in the southwestern Baluchistan region, where the attack took place, often target Pakistani security forces and people from the neighboring Punjab province. ‘Act of Terror:’ Gunmen Murder 14 Bus Passengers in Pakistan Cheat Sheet ®"

Amazon Fashion Takes All the Fun Out of Clothes Shopping—and Customers Love It - The Daily Beast,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/amazon-fashion-takes-all-the-fun-out-of-clothes-shoppingand-customers-love-it,"Amazon Fashion Takes All the Fun Out of Clothes Shopping—and Customers Love It Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/Photo by Getty The behemoth retailer wants to come for your closet like it came for the bookstore. But rather than dazzle you with designs, the site is catering to your most basic desires. Alaina Demopoulos 04.22.19 4:42 AM ET
L ast Sunday morning, I woke up to a message in my friends’ group chat with a link to the Saturday Night Live skit “ Fashion Coward .” It was a parody commercial for a store that caters to people who hate shopping. At Fashion Coward, customers can easily buy “clothes that suggest the general idea of a person.”
Racks are stocked with “brown sweaters, navy shirts, pants for the leg, and one black dress that says, ‘Keep it moving.’” The joke’s punchline is “It’s just Ann Taylor,” an easy jab at the much-maligned chain of business-casual basics.
But Ann Taylor has some competition in Amazon, where women flock to purchase utilitarian, good-enough clothing with as much passion as they would buying a new toilet brush.
The megaretailer's foray into capital-F fashion has been tricky. Despite attempts like glossy Vogue advertisements and the implementation of the try-before-you-buy program Amazon Wardrobe , the behemoth has failed to endear itself to industry insiders.
But Amazon has carved out a healthy niche in... well, no offense, but Fashion Cowards. The anti-peacocks among us who view what they put on their bodies as just another thing to buy, like a coffee maker or touchless garbage can, flock to the site to purchase “essentials.” (Representatives for Amazon Fashion declined The Daily Beast's request for interview.)
“A lot of people are not necessarily comfortable making fashion decisions,” Tyler McCall, deputy editor of Fashionista , told The Daily Beast. “That’s why we write trend wrap-ups, or the five things to buy at Zara this month to help people make the decision. The same reason I need somebody to tell me how to buy a vacuum cleaner, people want to know how to find a good winter coat that’s not $3,000.”
Amazon’s quiet sartorial coup started, in fact, with a coat. Or rather, The Coat , as the $137 Orolay Women’s Thickened Down Jacket has become known.
In March 2018, Katy Schneider of New York ’s revenue-generating commerce site The Strategist, wrote a short post called “The Unlikely Tale of an Amazon Coat That’s Taken Over the Upper East Side.”
Women who lived or socialized with those from the ritzy neighborhood spoke of the coat’s mind-boggling appeal. “I went to a Soulcycle on 83rd and I was one of four people wearing it,” Ana Maria Pimentel, the fashion director at Neiman Marcus, told the site. “Seven of my super-close friends have bought it since. A woman at a department store literally bought it on her phone, right in front of me.”
Relatively cheap, with two-day shipping, trendy zippers and puffing that some said looked expensive, The Coat quickly went viral. CNBC dubbed it a “must-have.” Influencer Arielle Charnas endorsed it to her million followers.
As Vox’ s Rebecca Charnas wrote in a piece about The Coat-related mania, one Glamour headline, ‘Everyone you know is buying the Amazon coat’ “sounded somehow like a threat.”
With the changing of seasons and shedding of coats come new ‘The’-prefaced pieces about items of Amazon clothing. InStyle profiled The Dixperfect One Piece : $27, boasting over 1,000 reviews, and the title of “universally-flattering.”
Just this week People boasted about finding “ The ‘Holy Grail’ of Yoga Pants ,” a $25 pair of black “tummy control” leggings.
Glamour spotted The Bra, a $68 Natori number with a “cult” following that even includes Lady Gaga, herself a noted one-woman fashion week and a follower of nearly nothing.
The items all have product names long enough rival a breathless James Joyce sentence. For instance, the one-piece's legal name is: Dixperfect Women's Retro 80s/90s Inspired High Cut Low Back One Piece Swimwear Bathing Suits. The word scramble is a hodgepodge of things you're likely to search, ensuring easy access to those who prefer to shop online.
Along with fitting into Google's algorithm, the clothing follows a similar visual equation. It's cheap, but could look expensive, simple, and comfortable. Definitely not unstylish, but mindlessly designed as to guarantee wherever you wear the goods will be the path of least compliments.
Entirely unexceptional—and that is the point. Let’s cover and lift up “the girls,” as the Dixperfect One Piece promises to do, and move on with our lives. “ I feel like the reviews are important—those are like instant feedback, like being in a dressing room with someone. ”
Channing Hargrove, fashion news writer for Refinery29 , told The Daily Beast that she is a frequent Amazon shopper. (It doesn't hurt that she sits next to her site’s market writer, who often sends her links to new finds.)
“Yesterday I searched for a ‘rhinestone belt,’ read the reviews, and picked the one I bought that way,” Hargrove said. “I feel like the reviews are important—those are like instant feedback, like being in a dressing room with someone.”
Last year, a handful of famous models like Hailey Baldwin and Kendall Jenner inexplicably decided to wear ’90s bicycle shorts out in the world. Women's fashion sites started to call the tricky trend A Thing. Before plunging into the world of designer spandex, Hargrove turned to Amazon.
“I knew it was trendy, but I didn't know if I was in love with it,” she said. “I decided to try bicycle shorts out, quietly order a bunch of cheap pairs with the best reviews on Amazon, to decide if I liked it or not.”
The test dive approach used to be reserved for fast fashion chains like H&M and Forever21, where women can decide whether or not they look good in imitation Yeezy bodycon dresses without spending $900.
But that requires the emotional energy it takes to trudge to a store, wait in line for a dressing room, and stare at yourself naked under less-than-flattering fluorescent lights.
“Amazon is easier, because you can do it from your bed, on your phone,” Hargrove said. “When you’re at dinner with your friend who has a great necklace on, you can order that necklace and get it in two days.”
Analysts predict Amazon retail will be worth somewhere between $45 to $85 billion by 2020. The site's fashion conquest began in 2002, when its marketplace first started selling clothes. Seven years later in 2009, Amazon purchased Zappos, at the time its biggest competitor, for a whopping $850 million .
For years, Amazon Fashion kept stock of what its shoppers wanted—and were searching—resulting in a lineup of mid-priced labels like Kate Spade, Calvin Klein, Lacoste, and Levi Strauss. In 2016, the company began to quietly sell a handful of its own new, private lines.
At the time, WWD reported that one of the Amazon brands, Lark & Ro, had the mission statement: “Our purpose is to simplify your life by serving up effortless style when you need it most.” One year later, Amazon Fashion tapped Christine Beauchamp, who led teams at Victoria's Secret, Ann Taylor, and Ralph Lauren, as president.
Last month, a report from the data analytics company CoreSight Research found Amazon Fashion to be the most-shopped apparel retailer in the United States, unseating Walmart as number one.
Another deep dive from the investment bank Piper Jaffray listed Amazon as the most popular shopping website for teens . Fifty percent of those surveyed said they shopped on the site, above Nike, Urban Outfitters, and American Eagle. “ The customer that’s most on Amazon is probably buying a utilitarian thing, like an electric broom, who thinks, ‘I might as well go over and get a pair of leggings as well.’ ”
But whether all that cash can buy clout remains to be seen. Charcy Evers, a fashion and retail trend analyst based in New York, told The Daily Beast that she has low expectations for the budding behemoth.
“I don’t see this going beyond the basics, the white T-shirts, with Amazon being a player in the fashion space,” Evers said. “The customer that’s most on Amazon is probably buying a utilitarian thing, like an electric broom, who thinks, ‘I might as well go over and get a pair of leggings as well.’”
As the issue of “sustainability” becomes less of a buzzword and an attempted industry-wide movement, Amazon could face increasing opposition.
Evers predicts: “We all have access to so much stuff, and what's going to rise to the top are unique, individual designers who make a statement, stand for something, advocate for causes beyond the clothing you wear.”"

A 50-year-old Canadian pleaded guilty to five wire fraud charges on Monday for running a Ponzi scheme while pretending to be a successful businessman with ties to NBA stars like Stephen Curry and Shaquille O’Neal, federal prosecutors said. According to the Justice Department, Khemraj Dave Hardat posed as a successful entrepreneur in the “performance beverage and water-bottling industries” between 2014 and 2018 to lure in investors. Hardat allegedly claimed O’Neal was one of his business partners, and said Curry would be endorsing one of his company’s products. According to the DOJ, he also doctored images of his bank account statements to make him appear more wealthy than he really was, faked advanced education degrees, and pretended to have connections with the CEO of PepsiCo and computer entrepreneur Michael Dell.
Hardat allegedly took investors’ money and used it to pay for his rent in Los Angeles’ Ritz-Carlton Residences, pay for his children’s private school tuition, pay off debts, and buy luxury vehicles. He also allegedly used the money he collected, totaling $5 million, to pay some of his previous investors. Hardat is scheduled for a August 12 sentencing hearing and faces up to 100 years in prison.

"Larry Mitchell Hopkins, Border Militia Leader, Allegedly Said Group Was Training to Assassinate Obama, Clinton",www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/larry-mitchell-hopkins-border-militia-leader-allegedly-said-group-was-training-to-assassinate-obama-clinton,"THREATS New Mexico Border Militia Leader Allegedly Said Group Planned to Assassinate Obama, Clinton Larry Mitchell Hopkins allegedly said his vigilante group was training to kill Hillary Clinton, George Soros, and Barack Obama, because of their ‘support of Antifa.’ 04.22.19 3:49 PM ET PAUL RATJE
The border militia leader who was arrested in New Mexico over the weekend on weapons charges allegedly said that his far-right group was training to kill prominent Democratic figures because of their “support of Antifa.”
According to an arrest warrant for Larry Mitchell Hopkins , witnesses told authorities that he’d said the United Constitutional Patriots were training to “assassinate” liberal billionaire George Soros, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and former President Barack Obama.
The 69-year-old and his armed militia, which spreads conspiracies and searches for asylum seekers on the border, have been accused of illegally detaining migrants . Hopkins was arrested Saturday on charges of possessing firearms and ammunition as a convicted felon. The Las Cruces Sun-News reports he could face three years probation and a $250,000 fine.
Witnesses also told authorities in Oct. 2017 that the group “had its ‘base’ at Hopkins’s residence, was supported by approximately 20 members, and was armed with AK-47 rifles and other firearms,” the arrest warrant states.
During a search of his property, the FBI found 10 guns in Hopkins’ “office,” which he claimed were owned by Fay Sanders Murphy, his “common law wife.” Hopkins told authorities there were two more guns in his bedroom—a shotgun and a handgun—and another handgun in his kitchen. All told, the FBI seized nine guns from Hopkins’ home as evidence, including shotguns and long rifles.
Saturday’s arrest marks the third time the militia leader has been arrested on weapons charges. In 1996, he was convicted for possessing a loaded firearm in Michigan. In 2006, he was also convicted in Oregon of felony possession of a firearm and criminal impersonation of a peace officer.
UCP and Hopkins claim to do work with Border Patrol, but the federal law-enforcement agency has denied having any ties to the vigilante group. A UCP spokesperson named Jim told The Daily Beast that there was “no question” about their work together, pointing to the group’s publicity videos in which Border Patrol agents can be seen in the background.
“That’s all documented, and not just once. It’s documented hundreds and hundreds of times over in the videos that I post,” he said.
Border Patrol, however, said it does “not endorse private groups or organizations” that take “enforcement matters into their own hands.”
UCP produces a radio show that spreads conspiracy theories, QAnon beliefs, and misinformation about migrants being connected to terrorists. Hopkins has also claimed President Trump has asked him about “Muslim immigration.”
According to the Las Cruces Sun-News , Hopkins made his initial court appearance Monday morning and has a detention hearing scheduled for April 29."

To his rally-goers, Donald Trump openly craves a 2020 showdown with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), salivating at the prospect of getting to run against an elderly, self-declared democratic socialist.
But in private, his view of a potential run against the senator is a lot more complex and less swaggeringly self-assured.
Those around the president say he’s been of two minds when the topic of facing Sanders in 2020 comes up. While he sees the senator as a vulnerable opponent, he also has offered begrudging respect for his political acumen. Trump will—sometimes unprompted—bring up Sanders’ own working-class support, and acknowledge that there is, in fact, potential for the senator to win over Trump voters with his populist appeal, three sources who’ve discussed this with the president tell The Daily Beast. The president has been impressed with Sanders’ ability to ignite his base and draw a large crowd, though not, in his words, as “good as Trump.” The president has also privately discussed the fundraising hauls that Sanders and his campaign have pulled off, noting Sanders’ impressive track record with small-dollar donors.
“In my conversations with the president, both in interviews and privately, I get the sense the president has clearly taken notice of the amount of money that Sanders is raising, the amount of small donors, and the passion of his followers,” said Eric Bolling, a BlazeTV host and friend of Trump and his family.
The respect the president has shown for Sanders is, in a way, a reflection of Trump’s own beliefthat the key ingredients for success in American politics are unconventionality and populism. Sanders, like the president, has cast himself as a politician who operates outside the traditional governing structures and whose north star is helping the American working class.
But while Trump has been quietly impressed by Sanders, aides and confidants say he doesn’t view him as an electoral threat, at least not yet. Bolling, for one, said Trump views a Sanders nomination as “a gift to his re-election campaign because he believes America is not ready for a socialist president of any kind.” And others who’ve spoken to Trump in recent months say that the president still expresses a desire to run against the senator, or someone of his ideological stripe, in part because it would easily afford him numerous lines of attack: from tying Sanders’ left-wing rhetoric to the economic crisis in Venezuela, to pushing caricatures of the Green New Deal, to warning of far-left government takeovers of major U.S. industries.
“President Trump would love to run against Bernie Sanders because President Trump believes he would crush Bernie at the ballot box and be able to hit him over the head with his socialist rhetoric from now until the election,” said Jason Miller, Trump’s former comms director for the presidential transition.
In public, Team Trump has adopted this bring-it-on posture. The president has gone after Sanders several times this month on his preferred social-media site, dubbing the senator “Crazy” while predicting that he, along with former Vice President Joe Biden, would be the likely Democratic nominees.
But the calculation is a bit more nuanced behind closed doors. When Trump talks to friends and advisers about Sanders, he often will note that Sanders drew far bigger (and more uproarious) crowds than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Miller even recalled that candidate Trump, during the 2016 race, would convey a “respect” for Sanders that was rooted in their mutual “distrust of the establishment.” Miller also recounted how candidate Trump talked about how “he never heard anyone clap for Hillary Clinton the way they clapped for Bernie.”
Sanders, for his part, has made no secret of his desire to draw voters from Trump’s coalition with an ideologically different flavor of anti-establishment messaging. Last week, the senator went on Fox News, the president’s favorite cable news network, to conduct a town hall meeting that was a thinly veiled attempt at reaching and converting Trump supporters.
The town hall was, from both a ratings and messaging perspective, a success. It also appears to have irked Trump, who lashed out publicly at Fox News.
For Sanders’ campaign, Trump’s social-media flailing was vindication of their strategy. It was also taken as evidence that the president would find it difficult to run against the senator should the two end up in the general election.
“We got in his head,” campaign manager Faiz Shakir told The Daily Beast on Friday. “It did seem like a bit of a panic and a bit of fear that came through his tweets and rightly so. Because I do think what you saw in the Fox News appearance was what will end up being a very intentional and successful outreach by Sen. Sanders to voters who may have either voted for Donald Trump, may have had some sympathy or empathy towards him, and have since soured on him.”
“Donald Trump, for as wild as his Twitter account is, I do think that what you get out of it is a sense that he understands that Bernie Sanders is a bit of a wild card,” Shakir added. “[He] doesn’t know how to deal with him.”
Sanders’ aides had anticipated that the town hall would be a mixed affair, with some supportive audience members but others who would jeer and boo, too. Instead, the crowd mostly applauded as the senator touted policies like Medicare for All, and didn’t register much dissatisfaction when he criticized Trump as a “pathological liar.” It’s a term Sanders uses in private about the president as well. On the car ride over to the town hall, Shakir recalled Sanders saying that Trump was such a liar that he can’t “even tell a straight story about where his dad was born”—a reference to the president erroneously stating that his father migrated from Germany.
The independent from Vermont wouldn’t say that he respects Trump’s political abilities, but acknowledges that “it will not be a cakewalk to defeat him,” Shakir said.
Sanders is clearly approaching this run for office differently than the campaign he ran four years ago. There is much more focus on presenting himself as a formidable general-election candidate. And there’s a greater sense of responsibility placed on defeating both Trumpism and Trump. At a recent event, Shakir recalled a woman who spoke with Sanders and had broken down as she recounted how difficult things had been for her during this administration. Shortly after that exchange, Sanders turned to his campaign manager and stressed just how important it was that they unseat Trump.
“There’s people out there whose hopes and fears are resting on us doing this right,” Shakir recalled Sanders saying to him. “We have to make sure we are doing everything right on this campaign.” "
Russia’s Filthy Rich Have a Thing for Miami—but the Good Times May Be Ending,www.thedailybeast.com,Anna Nemtsova,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/russias-filthy-rich-have-a-thing-for-miamibut-the-good-times-may-be-ending?source=articles&amp;via=rss,"Russia’s Filthy Rich Have a Thing for Miami—but the Good Times May Be Ending The Daily Beast 7 hrs ago By Anna Nemtsova © Provided by The Daily Beast Getty Russia’s Millionaire ‘Refugees’ MOSCOW—Here in the Russian capital, even though black snow has finally melted after the endless freezing winter, many people still feel a lack of vitamin D. But not everybody.
Thousands of rich Russian citizens—those not under U.S. sanctions—have been working on their tans around Biscayne Bay in the United States. Many spend their winters relaxing at Sunny Isles Beach in North Miami, enjoying the multi-bedroom condos they call their “distant dachas.” But there’s been notable tension wafting in on the sea breezes.
There are signs the good times are ending.
Yelena Berdichevskaya, an event manager, organizes concerts by famous Russian musicians in Miami. “This is the first time at least in a decade when we see half-empty Moscow-Miami airplanes,” Berdichevskaya told The Daily Beast.
In 2014 after Moscow took the Crimean Peninsula and backed a war in eastern Ukraine, Washington and the European Union imposed sanctions and the Kremlin banned tens of thousands of rich Russians, employees of law enforcement agencies, from traveling abroad. The U.S. sanctions were tightened further after extensive revelations about Moscow’s interference in the U.S. elections that put Donald Trump in the White House.
As a result, many rich Russian residents of Miami have had to rent out or sell their condos in the extravagant high-rises at Sunny Isles Beach, including one of the towers named Porsche Design, and another three of them bearing the label “Trump.”
To give you a sense of the extravagance: Porsche Design is famous for glass elevators allowing you to drive your car into your apartment up to 60 stories above the sea.
“The most recent talk of the town,” says Berdichevskaya, “was of a Russian family who due to politics had to sell their condo in the Porsche Design tower—everybody in the family was crying.”
They were not shedding tears about millions of their countrymen trying to deal with horrifying state hospitals who have no money to take their children or old parents to private clinics, much less the 20 percent of Russian families who don’t have indoor plumbing.
What makes the Russian elite in their little “Moscow by the Sea” worry about their Miami investments these days is fear of prison.
In 2017, Reuters published an extensive investigation into Trump properties in Florida, most of them at Sunny Isles Beach, and found that “at least 63 individuals with Russian passports or addresses” had bought “at least $98.4 million worth of property in seven Trump-branded luxury towers in southern Florida.”
Those numbers do not include those who successfully mask ownership through front companies, or go to Miami to rent and have their children born as Americans. Like many big-ticket real estate developments, there are always suspicions that the Miami properties serve not only as luxury getaways, but also as money laundries.
“I don’t think that corrupt Russian bureaucrats on sanctions are going to travel to their Miami homes any time soon,” says Gennady Gudkov, a former KGB officer who is now an opposition politician. “I hope they will be punished.”
The Anti-Corruption Foundation run by opposition leader Aleksey Navalny reported, for instance, that Nizhny Novgorod mayor Ivan Karnilin invested first $824,000 and then $1.1 million in Miami apartments in December 2013 and July 2014. This on a civil servant’s salary. The mayor allegedly registered the property in the names of his wife, Albina Karnilina and his daughter, Irina Ovchinnikova. Soon after Navalny published his reports, the mayor retired.
The Moscow team of Transparency International has conducted a series of investigative projects about “Russian Miami” or, as some call it, “Little Moscow.”
“Russian corrupt bureaucrats continue to see Miami as an attractive place for investment,” the deputy head of Transparency International here, Ilya Shumanov, told The Daily Beast. “Our project ‘Miami is Ours’ covered estates that belonged to businessmen, bandits, bureaucrats, politicians and even law enforcement officers, including former Interior Minister Gen. Anatoly Petukhov, who had invested over $30 million in Florida; even people responsible for the security system invested their money in Miami.”
Due to sanctions and to independent investigations conducted by corruption fighters, some hypocritical Russian state servants who invest and pay taxes in the United States have lost their jobs at home or had to sell their Miami residences, while others are banned from traveling to the U.S. altogether.
Russian legislators in Moscow may condemn the “Russophobic U.S. State Department,” but in Miami or in New York they seem to admire “the air of freedom,” as Member of Parliament Igor Lebedev said last fall. (Lebedev, take note, is the son of the controversial nationalist MP Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a big fan of Donald Trump. )
“I know several FSB [security service] and army generals who have huge properties in Miami but cannot travel outside of Russia,” Gudkov, the former KGB man, told The Daily Beast. “I don’t think that anything can change that now, after Mueller’s report comes out, since the sanctions are not the punishment for ‘collusion’ but for Russia’s bandit-like behavior all over Europe, Ukraine and the United States.”
Russians who can still travel stay in Miami during the winter months when it is dark and miserable here, returning back home mainly to make money. Russian business and real-estate deals are often discussed at the restaurants in the Bal Harbor mall.
That is where Lana Bell, a broker of luxury properties at Sotheby’s International Realty, tells Russian clients about attractive condos with spectacular sea views, and it appears, from what she says, that the election of Trump on Nov. 8, 2016, prompted an instant era of good feelings as well as high rolling for Russians in Miami.
Trump may have failed that year to seal a deal for a Moscow tower, but Muscovites made their way to his branded condos in Miami. Almost instantly their numbers and luxury investments surpassed those of traditional buyers from Colombia, Venezuela and Argentina.
The starting price for the condos Bell sells begins at about $3 million, she told The Daily Beast in a telephone interview. “My Russian clients have been buying condos in the most expensive towers, including the Trump Towers.” She noted that those are are right next to the “Kalinka” and “Matryoshka” stores specializing in Russian cuisine.
Bell, who has been in this highly competitive business for more than a decade, says that unlike American elites, who tend not to make their money so extremely obvious, Russian men show off their wealth as much as possible: “Russians can be easily recognized by their Bentleys and Rolls-Royces,” Bell says. “But this year the sales have gone down. It is becoming problematic for the Russian elite to take their money out of the country; and here the rules demand full disclosure, the name of the buyer and the source of money.”
Do Russian buyers, especially those loyal to President Vladimir Putin, feel bad about their secret estates in the nation the Kremlin constantly accuses of “Russophobia”? Hardly.
“Look, Russian patriots are happy here; Sunny Isles is a happy place. Russian men make money at home, they visit their Miami property just for a few months in winter.” Bell laughs. “Some of these rich daddies are in their fifties or older, while their women are in their twenties; the beach is packed with really young pregnant Russian girls, girls with babies. I sometimes wonder about their age—and life.”
Then there’s the question of what President Trump likes to call “anchor babies,” infants born in the United States and thus entitled to U.S. citizenship, thus making it easier for their parents eventually to apply for citizenship as well.
Natalia Borisova, a former manager at a Moscow state agency responsible for regional investments and Vasily Zubakin, a leading manager at Lukoil, one of Russia’s gas and oil giants, had their baby boy in Miami in September 2014. They followed the same agenda pursued by many rich Russians: rented a condo in the third Trump tower, spent a couple of nice months on the ocean, and got their newly born baby a U.S. passport.
“We were in Miami, where everybody around us spoke Russian,” Borsonova recalled in a recent interview with The Daily Beast, noting the irony that at that time, “Moscow was banning Western products in a move against the sanctions.”
“The medical service cost us around $4,000, the rent was around $6,000 a month; we had the nicest doctor, everything was easy, comfortable and pleasant,” Borisova said. “Our baby boy had Hollywood, Florida, as a place of birth in his passport.”
On a recent afternoon Tatiana Voloshin, a New York entrepreneur, was watching a loud group near her table on the veranda of Mira 5 Stars, a restaurant popular with rich Russians because its chef, Mirko Cldino, previously worked at Putin’s dacha outside Moscow. There were, as Voloshin recalls, six men and nine women with high heels and cosmetically-enhanced lips. “Some of the men were from Chechnya, I realized when one of the Russians said that their Chechen sober friends should drive.” Presumably the Muslims were not drinking.
The guests hopped into three Bentleys and one Maserati and took off. Voloshin said that she felt frustrated. She came to Miami to look for an apartment but the prices for real estate close to the beach turned out to be unaffordable. “I did not find a nice place, thanks to rich Russians who have spoiled the real estate market with their crazy bottomless budgets.”
Voloshin’s real-estate agent, Mikhail Shilt, says that his clients are both Russian and Chechen. “Some of my Chechen clients lived in Moscow before they came here; my buyers are businessmen and government officials, fifty-fifty,” Shilt said.
When the agent asked his Russian clients how their passion for investing in Miami condos went along with their loyalty to the Kremlin’s politics, they usually said that “their own happiness is their priority,” the agent said.

Prosecutors in Broward County, Florida, said they have started to investigate an incident caught on video in which a police officer is seen bashing a teen’s head into the pavement, the Sun-Sentinel reports. “This incident is under investigation by my office,” Broward State Attorney Mike Satz said in a statement Monday. “Our prosecutors and investigators had already scheduled a meeting for Tuesday with the attorney for the 15-year-old student... The student’s family has hired a new attorney, and we are arranging a meeting with the new lawyer as soon as they are available.” Video posted on social media shows two deputies—identified as Christopher Krickovich and Sgt. Greg LaCerra—taking down a 15-year-old black boy, slamming his forehead into the ground, and punching him repeatedly. The Broward County Sheriff’s Office said last week that Krickovich had been placed on “restricted assignment pending an investigation,” while LaCerra’s position has remained unchanged. Video of the incident went viral over the weekend, along with the hashtag #JusticeForLucca. Florida Prosecutors Probing Violent Arrest of Black Teen Cheat Sheet ®"
