(Adrian Sanchez-Gonzalez/AFP/Getty Images) “Real Time” host Bill Maher warned Democrats that they'll lose the 2020 presidential election if their message on immigration is designed to appeal only to other Democrats. Turning the immigration issue into a “woke contest” will only hand the election to President Trump, the liberal late-night host said Friday.
During the show's panel discussion, Maher said he didn’t believe that immigration is a top 10 issue “in reality,” but stressed that it was a “campaign issue” on which Trump ran and won in 2016.

“If it becomes a 'woke' contest, then the Democrats lose on this,” Maher said. “Yes, they look better, but it’s impossible not to look better next to him!”
Panelist Wendy Sherman, who served in the State Department during the Obama administration, told Maher that Trump “created this immigration crisis,” pointing to his administration’s decisions on cutting aid to Central American countries, separating migrant families and “putting kids in cages.”
Maher, however, only chuckled at her remarks.
“This is what Democrats say, which only gets other Democrats,"" Maher told Sherman. ""This is not the speech that is going to win any [swing] voters. You’ve [already] got the compassion vote!”
The HBO star credited former President Barack Obama for being able to “keep the left” while deporting record numbers of illegal immigrants. On Our Radar"
"Migrants break border gate, force their way into Mexico",www.foxnews.com,US Tech Workers,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/migrants-break-border-gate-force-their-way-into-mexico/,"Migrants break border gate, force their way into Mexico Posted on 12 Apr MEXICO CITY – Mexican authorities said a group of about 350 migrants broke the locks on a gate at the Guatemalan border Friday and forced their way into southern Mexico to join a larger group of migrants trying to make their way toward the United States. The National Immigration Institute did not identify the nationalities of the migrants, but they are usually from Central America.
A similar confrontation occurred on the same border bridge between Mexico and Guatemala last year.
The institute said the migrants were acting in a “hostile” and “aggressive” way, and accused them of also attacking local police in Metapa, a Mexican village that lies between the border and the nearby city of Tapachula.
The group of 350 pushed past police guarding the bridge and joined a larger group of about 2,000 migrants who are walking toward Tapachula in the latest caravan to enter Mexico.
Claudia Jaqueline Sandoval, 43, from El Progreso, Honduras, was walking toward Tapachula with her six-year-old daughter. Another son and a daughter are already in the United States.
“I have been HIV positive for 16 years,” said Sandoval, but her reason for going north was not just medical treatment. “It has been two years since I heard from my son” in the United States, and money is scarce, she said.
There are already several groups of migrants in the southern border state of Chiapas who have expressed frustration at Mexico’s policy of slowing or stopping the process of handing out humanitarian and exit visas at the border.
A group of several hundred Cuban, African and Central American migrants have been waiting at the immigration offices in Tapachula for documents that would allow them to travel to their U.S. border, where most plant to request asylum.
Some members of that group have scuffled with immigration authorities and broken windows at the offices in recent days, accusing officials of making them wait too long for papers.
And another group of an estimated 2,500 Central American and Cuban migrants have been stuck for at least a week further west in the Chiapas town of Mapastepec, also waiting for papers. This entry was posted in H1-B News , Immigration and tagged H1B Visa News , Immigration News . US Tech Workers"

Probation officials say Souzer escaped from the Orange County Juvenile Hall and jumped a perimeter fence just after midnight, Friday April 12, 2019. The 6-foot-tall, 200-pound teen was wearing red pants and a white shirt and may have an injured leg. (Orange County Sheriff's Department via AP) LOS ANGELES – Authorities on Friday recaptured a 15-year-old boy who is charged with killing his mother and managed to escape a Southern California juvenile facility. A ""very good lead"" led authorities to a McDonald's restaurant in Anaheim, where Ike Souzer was taken peacefully into custody on Friday night, Orange County sheriff's Capt. Mike Peters said. The teenager was given medical treatment for puncture wounds on his leg that might have come from his escape, Peters said.
Ike Souzer escaped the Orange County Juvenile Hall, somehow got onto a roof and then jumped a perimeter fence just after midnight Friday, said Steve Sentman, chief probation officer for the county.
Jail staff spotted Souzer on the roof, then turned on a facility-wide alarm and called the sheriff's office, he said.
Peters said deputies were ""very quick"" to respond, but Souzer was able to elude capture.
The sheriff's office released surveillance footage showing Souzer tending to an apparent wound on his leg shortly after escaping and then walking seemingly casually away from the facility. The 6-foot, 200-pound teen was wearing red pants and a white shirt.
Dozens of law enforcement personnel, including FBI agents and federal marshals, searched for the boy.
Sentman said it was the first escape from the 434-bed facility in at least two decades and that an investigation is underway into how it happened.
Souzer has been in custody since he was 13, when he was arrested on suspicion of fatally stabbing his mother, 48-year-old Barbra Scheuer-Souzer. His escape came in the middle of Souzer's trial on a murder charge in juvenile court, said Kimberly Edds, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office.
Souzer's public defender, David Hammond, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday.
A Gofundme page for Scheuer-Souzer says she was so good at helping her son with autism that she went back to school to help others with the condition and was about to graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles.
""Through her unconditional love and commitment, she helped her son go from non-verbal to verbal status,"" according to the page. ""Her whole goal was to help her son and the autistic community by giving back and serving the needs of others.""
Scheuer-Souzer had three other grown children and three grandchildren. Trending in US"
Poll workers journey to reach India's most remote voters,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/poll-workers-journey-to-reach-indias-most-remote-voters,"by AMRIT DHILLON

In this April 10, 2019, photo, Indian election officials and paramilitary soldiers with election materials walk along the river Brahmaputra to board on a country boat on the eve of the first phase of general election in Majuli, Assam, India. (AP Photo/Anupam Nath, File) NEW DELHI – The figures involved in India’s general election are staggering: 900 million voters, 83 million first-time voters, 11 million poll workers, nearly 4 million electronic voting machines, 1 million polling booths and 570 special trains for migrant laborers and security personnel. Such numbers convey the scale of the world’s biggest democratic exercise. But its smaller numbers that show India’s commitment to reach every voter, no matter how remote.
In India’s six-week marathon election that began this week, the Election Commission has ruled that no voter should have to travel more than 2 kilometers, or just over a mile, from their home to cast a ballot, whether they live on a Himalayan peak or an island in the Bay of Bengal.
The polling booth in Gir Forest National Park in Gujarat is set up for the sole human inhabitant, a Hindu priest who lives among the lions. Polling officials hike for a whole day to reach the remote village of Malogam in Arunachal Pradesh, where just one woman is registered to vote.
Poll workers must be in superb physical condition to cross mountains, rivers, deserts, forests and national parks. The work entails arduous journeys by train, road, helicopter and boat, accompanied by porters who carry the briefcase-sized voting machines, registers, ink and other election paraphernalia on their backs.
In Arunachal Pradesh, a state in India’s northeast that borders Bhutan, China and Myanmar and where voting took place Thursday, most polling stations are located inside dense, Himalayan forest.
Poll workers set off a week before the vote. The first leg of the journey was a three-hour drive from Changlang, a district in the east, to the city of Maio, a tourist destination 100 kilometers (62 miles) away.
From Maio, the next stop was Vijoynagar, some 163 kilometers (101 miles) away, via the Namdapha National Park. No road connects the two towns, and the terrain is subject to frequent flash floods and landslides. Journeys here are measured in days rather than hours.
So, the team reached Vijoynagar by Indian Air Force helicopter. In pre-monsoon time, bad weather can force the pilot to abort several attempts. That’s why a week’s leeway is given to the team. If all else fails, it’s six days to reach Vijoynagar by foot.
From Vijoynagar, the caravan walked the final leg of their odyssey to the polling station of Gandhigram. It is only 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from Vijoynagar but the trek takes eight hours, through eerily dark jungles where no sunlight steals through the canopy and under constant threat of an ambush by a herd of elephants.
Majestic gorges were crossed on casually strung, flimsy bamboo suspension bridges that wobble like jelly in strong winds. The team traveled with torches, water filters and emergency lights, and a local guide who knows the jungle.
“These are not Alpine tracks. These are sub-tropical forests with thick undergrowth. There is no stated rule, but we prefer people under 45 because a lot of stamina and energy are required,” said Kaling Tayeng, the chief electoral officer of Arunachal Pradesh.
The marathon expedition to Gandhigram was all for 242 voters.
In the Ladakh region of Indian-controlled Kashmir in the north, a polling station at an altitude of 4,327 meters (14,196 feet) is being set up for only 12 voters.
Another Ladakh station, Anlay Pho, is so high at 4,500 meters (almost 15,000 feet) above sea level that polling teams must carry oxygen tanks.
When Winston Churchill described India as a “geographical expression” no more a united nation than the equator, he was speaking to the diversity in landscapes that makes the Election Commission’s job so challenging.
At the other extreme of the country from the mountain peaks of Ladakh are the low-lying Andaman and Nicobar Islands where voting machines were transported by various seafaring vessels for Thursday’s vote.
The polling station at Pilopatia, just 9.7 meters (32 feet) above sea level, is famous for the trouble it presents election officials.
Officials start off on a 24-hour by ship journey from Port Blair, then by speedboat, then by small dinghy and finally by a “hodi,” or traditional boat used by the local tribe, said Dr. Monica Priyadarshini, a Nicobar district election officer.
“In places, the waters are infested with crocodiles and sea snakes,” Priyadarshini said.
The voting machines were protected inside waterproof boxes and other polling material was kept dry under layers of plastic cover. The journey ended with a splash: Priyadarshini and the team clambered out and waded through waist-high water to reach the shore. All this for just nine voters.
Many polling booths in remote areas have no mobile connectivity. Here too, the team had to use wireless sets and satellite phones to send the commission’s mandated twice hourly reports on the progress of polling.
“I had voted in elections, but I never had any idea of the work that goes into ensuring that every single vote is cast,” Priyadarshini said.
In Chhattisgarh, central India, where some polling stations were open this week, it is both geography and ideology that present problems. The jungles are thick with vegetation and teeming with Maoist insurgents called Naxalites who attack government officials with bullets, incendiary devices and land mines.
Earlier this week, insurgents attacked a convoy of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, killing a state party lawmaker and four other people in his vehicle with an improvised explosive device.
“We had 100 high security zones that are very dangerous. In some of them, over 100 security personnel accompanied just 20 polling officials to secure their path through the forest,” said Chhattisgarh police chief Durgesh Kumar Awasthi. “My men haven’t slept for days.”"

"Ocasio-Cortez coal-mine visit requires an apology to Crenshaw first, Ky. lawmaker says | Fox News",www.foxnews.com,Louis Casiano,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kentucky-rep-wants-ocasio-cortez-to-apologize-to-war-veteran-colleague-before-visiting-his-state,"U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., placed the condition on Ocasio-Cortez&apos;s planned visit to the Bluegrass State in a letter to the freshman congresswoman on Friday. Barr’s demand stems from comments that Ocasio-Cortez recently directed at U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw , R-Texas, over his response to domestic terrorism.
""I urge you to apologize to our colleague prior to coming to visit Kentucky,"" Barr said in the letter, describing Ocasio-Cortez&apos;s&apos; remarks as an example of a ""lack of civility that is becoming far too common in the U.S. House of Representatives.""
Ocasio-Cortez told Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL, that he should focus on domestic terrorism after he slammed Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., for describing the 9/11 attacks as “ some people did something .” In a March speech to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Omar spoke of the rise in anti-Islamic activity in response to terrorist incidents.
""Far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and frankly, I&apos;m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,"" she said. ""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.""
Crenshaw decried her comments, tweeting: “First member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as &apos;some people who did something.&apos; Unbelievable.""
Ocasio-Cortez stepped in the middle of the feud to defend Omar and called out Crenshaw for not co-sponsoring a measure to aid 9/11 victims and their families.
""You refuse to cosponsor the 9/11 Victim’s Compensation Fund , yet have the audacity to drum resentment towards Ilhan w/completely out-of-context quotes,"" she tweeted.
“In 2018, right-wing extremists were behind almost all U.S. domestic terrorist killings,"" Ocasio-Cortez continued. ""Why don’t you go do something about that?""
Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez, told the Louisville Courier-Journal that Crenshaw targeted Omar because she is one of the first Muslim women to serve in Congress.
Following Ocasio-Cortez&apos;s comments, Barr and other conservatives pointed to Crenshaw’s war record, having served three tours in Afghanistan and losing his right eye. During a hearing earlier this month about the Green New Deal , he invited Ocasio-Cortez to meet coal miners. But first, he would like her to apologize to Crenshaw.
Barr said his office has not received a response to his invitation.
""Luckily, Kentucky has open borders,"" Trent said. ""If we decided to go to Kentucky to visit with coal miners, which we certainly hope to, and talk about the opportunities that can be brought to the rural South ... and to coal-mine country and Appalachia, that can be brought by transitioning to renewable energy and the Green New Deal, we&apos;ll be excited to do so.""

Court temporarily blocks halt to Trump policy forcing asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico,www.foxnews.com,Louis Casiano,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/court-temporarily-blocks-halt-to-trump-policy-forcing-asylum-seekers-to-stay-in-mexico,"The decision by the three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked a lower ruling from taking effect and gave civil liberties groups until Tuesday to submit arguments on why the asylum policy should be put on hold. The government has until Wednesday to argue why it should remain in place. On Monday, a federal judge halted the change to the asylum system, saying it violated U.S. law by failing to evaluate the dangers to migrants while in Mexico . The suit was filed by 11 Central American asylum-seekers and advocacy groups who argue forcing asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico puts migrants risk given the uptick in violence there.

Thousands have fled Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador in recent months amid growing gang violence and abject poverty in the region. The ruling comes as more than 2,000 migrants made their way through Mexico on Friday, hoping to reach the U.S.-Mexico border. Mexican authorities said around 350 migrants broke the locks on a gate at the Guatemalan border Friday and forced their way into the country.
The government is asking the 9th Circuit to keep the asylum policy while the lawsuit makes its way through the courts. It argued halting it would endanger the public.

Families seeking asylum are typically released in the U.S. with notices to appear in court. The new policy began in January at the nation’s busiest border crossing in San Diego. More than 1,300 asylum-seekers have been to Mexico so far, according to the Mexican government.
""I haven&apos;t heard of anyone who&apos;s been sent back since the judge&apos;s order on Monday,"" American Civil Liberties Union attorney Judy Rabinovitz said.
The Trump administration has said its stance on asylum is a response to a shortage of detention space for migrants and overwhelmed immigration officials as more migrants appear at the border each day.

And while the castmates have stayed in touch over the years, Bach, who sizzled on the screen as sultry country girl Daisy Duke, didn’t think twice to kick off the celebration with fans.

We spoke with the 65-year-old star about how she earned the iconic role, why she almost turned it down and becoming a sex symbol. Bach also set the record straight on whether there was any canoodling with John Schneider, 59, or Wopat, 67.
Fox News: How does it feel to know “Dukes of Hazzard” is 40 years old?
Catherine Bach: It’s just wild. I’m just so proud of this legacy. We’ve managed to entertain people after all this time. And now it’s a hit on Amazon. It’s just wonderful. This is what the show was about — entertaining people. I’ve done a lot of different things since that show, but this part somehow continues to connect with people. It just makes me proud. And I just love meeting the fans. … We just want to take “Dukes” on the road for them. … Because of that show, I’ve not only managed to meet fans but their kids too. It’s crazy… It’s a history we all share together.
Fox News: Producers originally wanted a Dolly Parton look-alike to play Daisy Duke. So how did you get the role?
Bach: That’s still a mystery *laughs*… I had just done a one-woman show that was well received. That resulted in an offer to do movies of the week with ABC…. It’s funny because around that time, my agency had fired me and I hadn’t gone out in an interview for two years. According to them, I was too exotic looking. I was told, “We’re never going to make money off you. Aside from doing a movie here and there, we don’t see a television series in your future. We just don’t see that kind of thing happening. So we’re going to let you go because it’s a lot of work to represent you.” That’s what initially compelled me to do the one-act play.

My husband at the time was very connected with show business and worked with Bob Clark, who was writing with the show’s creator, Gy Waldron. He must have told him my stories because Bob called me and said, ""I’m working on this project and I’ve been thinking about you. I bring you up about your stories. I would love for you to try out for this role, Daisy Duke."" I went, ""No, no, no.""
Fox News: Why didn’t you want to play Daisy Duke?
Bach: Here’s the thing — they’ve been looking for a year for that part. They went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Georgia and California. Nothing. So I said, ""That’s very nice of you to think of me, and I know you’re doing this as a favor to my husband, but you don’t have to."" I just didn&apos;t think I had a chance. But he goes, ""I really want you to come in.""

A few weeks later, I was at some little Italian restaurant in Beverly Hills with my girlfriend, who directed my one-act play… I tell her, ""I do have this interview that I’m supposed to go, but I’m not. … You know part Daisy Duke for Warner Bros.? They want me to come in, but I know I’m not going to get it."" … She goes, ""It’s Warner Bros. You never know who you’re going to meet on the way in and on the way out. Just go!"" So I went.
After I did my reading during the audition, there was total silence. I thought, ""Oh no, they didn’t like what I did."" Then everyone, we’re talking about 30 people, got up and started clapping. They just connected with my vision of how this part should be played. Two weeks later I was on a plane to Georgia.
POP STAR TELLS ALL Fox News: Is it true you came up with the idea to wear short shorts or daisy dukes?
Bach: You would have too! *laughs* [The creators] wanted me to wear a poodle skirt that matched the tablecloth. I said, ""You want me to match the tablecloth? That’s demeaning to women."" They went, ""We didn’t come up with that!"" They took me across the street from Warner Brothers and sure enough, there were these older ladies waitressing at this little Italian restaurant wearing poodle skirts that matched the tablecloth.
I had go-go boots, a white turtleneck and a blonde wig because the creator loved Dolly Parton. I thought, ""We need a costume change."" So I got my jean shorts that I could never get even, with cowboy boots and a little top… They loved it.
Fox News: Honestly, were there any dates or hookups with you and Tom Wopat or John Schneider?
Bach: Let me say this — as much as those guys were the most charming, sexiest friends and men on the planet and women all over just adored them — they were really like my brothers. As much as I appreciate them, there’s no way I would be, as you say, hooking up with them. Just look at your brother or whoever is really close to you and go ""Can I do this?"" It’s a no *laughs*.
Fox News: You posed for a famous poster that sold 5 million copies and your legs were insured for $1 million. How did it feel to be this sex symbol, this American pinup?
Bach: I didn’t look at it as being a pinup. On a personal level, my husband at the time didn’t like me working. So I was going through this hard time emotionally trying to be independent and assertive… Also, Warner Bros. wanted me to follow the same formula as Farrah Fawcett ... But I felt like audiences wanted something else. They wanted an all-American country girl… They said, ""If you’re not doing it our way, we’re not paying for it."" … I said, ""No problem, I’ll do it."" So I took those shorts, a little red and white top I made…. I did my own makeup and got some daisies… A friend of mine shot that poster, front start to finish, in an hour.
Fox News: Were you ever worried about being typecast?
Bach: There is a certain amount of typecasting, sure. Everybody goes through that… But I know I’m an actress. And I have not played that part since I finished “Dukes of Hazzard.” … I know who I am and I’m not worried about it. And everything can’t be the biggest hit. You can get the biggest part every single time. All I can do as an actress is deliver the work the best way I can. And I don’t mind if people still call me Daisy Duke or associate me with her. I think it’s cute and charming.
Fox News: You’ve managed to avoid scandal in Hollywood. How?
Bach: I don’t know *laughs*. I’m interested in having a good time. I’m not interested in drugs. Just think about where those drugs come from. It’s disgusting. Just watch “Narcos” *laughs* and you’ll see why you shouldn’t be around that. It’s horrible. I wouldn’t even consider that. As for alcohol? I’ll have a drink, sure, but I won’t let anything take over me. My love for my family, my children and I, ultimately, prevent that.

Man who says he’s Charles Manson’s grandson films infamous cult leader’s funeral for doc: ‘This is my story’,www.foxnews.com,Stephanie Nolasco,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/man-who-says-hes-charles-mansons-grandson-films-infamous-cult-leaders-funeral-for-doc-this-is-my-story,"Email
A variety of parties have claimed the rights to killer mastermind Charles Manson's body, local officials said. (Associated Press) Jason Freeman, who says he is the grandson of notorious cult leader Charles Manson , wants to set the record straight in a new two-hour documentary. On April 13, Reelz is premiering “Charles Manson: The Funeral,” which explores how the Bradenton, Fla., resident fought to win custody over the corpse of one of the most infamous murderers of America.
Manson was convicted of organizing the horrific slayings of Hollywood actress Sharon Tate and six others in 1969 — killings so shocking they continue to resonate nearly half a century later.

At the time of her death at age 26, Tate, who was married to filmmaker Roman Polanski , was pregnant with the couple’s child.
The 50th anniversary of the Manson murders is on Aug. 9, which has sparked several films including “The Haunting of Sharon Tate” with Hilary Duff ; “Charlie Says” with Matt Smith – of “Doctor Who” fame – as Manson; “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” directed by Quentin Tarantino and starring Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio ; and “Tate,” starring Kate Bosworth as the ’60s starlet, which has no set release date at the moment.
Manson was originally given the death penalty but it was ruled unconstitutional in California in 1972. His sentence was changed to nine consecutive life terms and he was denied parole 12 times.
SHARON TATE'S SISTER EXPLAINS WHY SHE'S GIVING AWAY STAR'S ICONIC WEDDING DRESS
Manson died in 2017 at age 83. While the failed musician -turned-vile criminal was worshipped by the Manson 'family,' a group of ragtag followers who acted upon his every wish and whim, the only actual family member Manson had at the time of his death was his alleged grandson, who held a funeral for him once the court awarded him the body after a long legal battle involving two others.
“I wanted to film my life journey and share the story through my eyes,” Freeman told Fox News on why he participated in the Reelz documentary. “I knew at the time my grandfather was sick. … [but] I had no clue this film would ultimately chronicle his death.”
Freeman’s father was reportedly Charles Manson Jr., one of the sinister patriarch’s three known children, who later changed his name to Jay White. White was born to Manson’s first wife, Rosalie Willis. Unable to cope with the grisly murders committed by the Manson family, as well as the burden and impact of his infamous father, White killed himself in 1993.
Freeman grew up in Ohio with his mother and said he knew at an early age his grandfather was Manson. However, Freeman claimed only later he fully understood the nature of Manson’s crimes.

SHARON TATE'S SISTER SLAMS PAROLE RECOMMENDATION
“It really hit me during history class in junior high,” he claimed. “I came in and the name Charles Manson was written on the chalkboard. When that story was opened up and revealed to me about the murders, that’s the first time I would say that I was exposed to everything. Before then… I really didn’t have the graphic details of what happened or how many people were killed.”
Freeman said that before he went public with his claim in 2012, his family avoided bringing up the name Manson in the household.
“It was always known that it was something that our family didn’t talk about,” he explained. “Back then it was harder to get questions answered…. Anytime Charles Manson’s name was brought up, it was always an issue. We didn’t talk about it much.”

According to the documentary, Freeman began corresponding with Manson through letters and phone calls in 2011. At the time, Freeman said he wrote a book titled “Knocking Out the Devil,” which discussed his upbringing.

“He said some friends reach out to me first,” alleged Freeman. “He read my book…. He first told me, ‘So you think you can knock the devil out of me?’ Then he starts laughing.”
But when asked what his conversations were like, Freeman shot back, “I don’t want to get into that right now.” After pressed on why he was willing to speak with Manson, he responded, “Well, because there was no one else there. And he’s family. That’s why.”

In 2018, Newsweek reported at least three people claimed they had a legal right to Manson’s body, including another man claiming to be his long-lost son, as well as a prison pen pal named Michael Channels. However, a Bakersfield, Calif., county court commissioner ruled that Freeman is determined to be the surviving competent adult next of kin. Kern County commissioner Alisa R. Knight added that “no sufficient probative evidence was provided to this court to refute Freeman’s claims.”
“You have to look at the evidence they have to make the claim,” said Freeman. “It was a journey of paperwork, but it’s God’s will on how this plays out, not mine.”

The Los Angeles Times also reported that Freeman told a judge he would not agree to a DNA test to determine the validity of his claim unless ordered to do so by the court. The test was sought out by Channels, who claimed Manson left everything to him. But Freeman maintained that a 2002 will Channels alleged he possessed is a forgery. Freeman said he would take the test if the judge orders it because he is convinced of his bloodline.

“As we went through each court hearing, the evidence of where my father and I are bonded together legally through our paperwork, [like] social security when he passed,” said Freeman. “I gave all of my paperwork to my attorney when this started… My mother found original documents for child support and death benefits. That’s what I stood on. I stood on the relationship I had with my father, Charles Manson Jr. That’s what I’ve known all my life. If that’s good enough for the court system — if they wanted me to, they would have had me do it.”
Manson’s funeral was filmed for the Reelz documentary before his ashes were scattered in California. Freeman said he wanted to give his grandfather, regardless of his notoriety, a proper send-off. He hopes the documentary will finally set the record straight about his unusual upbringing so that he can finally move on with his life.
“If you have a belief in our God… you know we walk through this life and try to do the right thing,” he explained. “And it was the right thing for me to take that next step in my life and accepting my grandfather into my life. This is my story. And it was an experience that I would never give up. I found answers about my family that I needed to know personally. And you only have one family. There’s no one else there. It was a no-brainer for me. That’s just what you do.”

"Hackers can access pacemakers, but don't panic just yet",www.foxnews.com,Healthline.com,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/hackers-can-access-pacemakers-but-dont-panic-just-yet,"That’s the core message of a new advisory from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In late March, the agency warned that computer hackers can easily gain access to implanted cardiac defibrillators made by Medtronic.
“An attacker with adjacent short-range access to an affected product, in situations where the product’s radio is turned on, can inject, replay, modify, and/or intercept data within the telemetry communication,” according to a statement from the DHS.
TOT ER VISITS “This communication protocol provides the ability to read and write memory values to affected implanted cardiac devices; therefore, an attacker could exploit this communication protocol to change memory in the implanted cardiac device,” the advisory continued.
The devices all use Medtronic’s proprietary Conexus system, which the DHS’ National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center said is vulnerable to “low skill level” attackers who can interfere with, generate, modify, or intercept Conexus radio frequency (RF) communications.
“The Conexus telemetry protocol… does not implement authentication or authorization,” the most basic types of protection against unauthorized access, according to the advisory. Nor is communication with the device encrypted, meaning that hackers can gather personal medical data as well.
The announcement came as no surprise to cybersecurity experts.
“Cybersecurity across the board in biomedical devices is so poor,” Dennis Chow, chief information security officer at SCIS Security in Houston, told Healthline.
Tyler Hudak, head of incident response at Ohio cybersecurity firm TrustedSec, who formerly held the same title at the Mayo Clinic, agrees.
“This is absolutely indicative of the lack of security for medical devices. Traditionally, there has been a complete lack of security,” Hudak told Healthline.
No reported attacks so far In a statement, Medtronic said it’s conducting security checks to look for unauthorized or unusual activity affecting its devices.
“To date, no cyberattack, privacy breach, or patient harm has been observed or associated with these issues,” according to a company statement sent to Healthline.
Hudak told Healthline that despite official reassurances, such an attack “is not theoretical.”
“It’s definitely possible,” Hudak said. “Researchers were able to perform these attacks.”
In a nightmare scenario, he says, a hacker could shut off a defibrillator or command it to deliver a shock to the heart.
On the other hand, hackers wouldn’t be able to access the devices from their basement.
“That’s probably within the realm of spy novels,” Hudak says.
They would have to be within a few feet of the wearer and would have to time their attacks to when the devices “wake up” to communicate data, both factors that limit risk.
Dr. Shephal Doshi, a cardiac electrophysiologist and director of cardiac electrophysiology and pacing at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California, says an attempt to reprogram devices in a way that exposes patients to danger “would be extremely rare and unlikely.”
“The defibrillators need to be… within 20 feet to actually reprogram the device,” he told Healthline. “People cannot reprogram the device while you are sleeping from a remote location.
“There would have to be within close proximity of your device, and your device would have to be in an active state to allow such reprogramming. This would make it impractical for someone to develop a contraption and then stand next to the patient and reprogram the device.”
Medtronic and the Food and Drug Administration recommended that patients and physicians “continue to use devices and technology as prescribed and intended, as this provides for the most efficient way to manage patients’ devices and heart conditions,” according to the company statement.
A fix may be coming A software update to improve device security is currently under development and should be available later this year, subject to government approval, according to the company statement.
Medtronic also advised device users to take other steps to defend against attacks, including maintaining physical control over home monitors and programming devices as well as using only devices provided directly by doctors or Medtronic.
They also advised consumers to avoid connecting unapproved devices to monitors or programmers and only use programmers in medical facilities and home monitors in private areas.
Chow urges people with these implanted devices to go to their doctor’s office to have the device firmware updated once it’s available.
“There’s no reason not to take measures to protect yourself,” he said.
“Because the risk of changing the defibrillator involves a substantial risk of infection at the time of surgery, it is not logical to want to change the device based on the fear that someone is going to hack into them,” Doshi said.
“Patients should verify with their physicians if they have any of these models of devices that are potentially at risk [and] verify that they are connected to the remote monitoring system, which may provide them an opportunity to have automatic updates to the software,” he added.
The products affected The models of ICDs (implantable-cardioverter defibrillators) and CRT-Ds (implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy/defibrillator devices) vulnerable to hackers include:
Amplia CRT-D (all models)
CareLink Monitor, version 2490C
CareLink 2090 Programmer
Claria CRT-D (all models)
Compia CRT-D (all models)
Concerto CRT-D (all models)
Concerto II CRT-D (all models)
Consulta CRT-D (all models)
Evera ICD (all models)
Maximo II CRT-D and ICD (all models)
Mirro ICD (all models)
MyCareLink Monitor, versions 24950 and 24952

Protecta ICD and CRT-D (all models)
Secura ICD (all models)
Virtuoso ICD (all models)

The advisory doesn’t apply to Medtronic pacemakers, insertable cardiac monitors, or other Medtronic devices.

Rachel Campos-Duffy: Christians won’t fall for Buttigieg’s platitudes,www.foxnews.com,Rachel Campos-Duffy,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rachel-campos-duffy-christians-buttigiegs-platitudes,"Buttigieg blasts 'hypocrisy' of Trump's evangelical followers Mayor Pete Buttigieg calls out evangelicals who support President Trump. Fox News contributor Rachel Campus-Duffy calls the criticism a fundamental misunderstanding of what Christians really want. I don’t need my president to be my savior – I already have one. However, after eight years of President Obama’s anti-Christian agenda, it was time to get a new leader in the White House who would defend Americans’ right to freedom of religion. I am a practicing Catholic, not an evangelical Christian , but in 2016 I stood with millions of evangelicals who decided that Donald Trump would be the best person to fight for our religious liberty.
Since taking office, President Trump has done exactly that. He is unwaveringly pro-life, supports giving poor and working-class parents the same choice in education as rich parents, named a religious liberty czar, denounces Christian persecution domestically and abroad, and is the best friend our ally Israel has ever had in the White House.
BUTTIGIEG SURGES TO THIRD PLACE IN NEW NH POLL
These are some of the top issues Christians care about – not that Democrats seem to care. Their 2020 presidential candidates try to pander to the faith community, but their actions speak louder than words and Christian voters simply aren’t buying it.
Now yet another Democratic candidate is jumping into the race: Pete Buttigieg , the mayor of South Bend, Indiana – which was named “one of the most dangerous cities in the United States.” Buttigieg has made Christianity a cornerstone of his candidacy, but while he talks the talk, his record in office doesn’t show he is walking the walk. As mayor, Buttigieg blocked a pro-life women’s care center from opening in South Bend, against the will of the city’s Common Council. Meanwhile, he disregarded several complaints against the proposed medical director of a South Bend abortion clinic, who was found to have failed to report sex abuse of girls under 16. And, he is on record supporting late-term abortion as stated in the bill passed in New York state and proposed in Virginia.
Buttigieg preaches kindness and open-mindedness but is quick to cast personal judgment on the faith of those with whom he disagrees. Just look at the way he has repeatedly attacked President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence’s faith, despite pondering, “What can we talk about that brings us together?” Pence, on the other hand, has only spoken kind words about the mayor.
Most frustrating for me has been Buttigieg’s repeated accusations that Republicans and President Trump do not care about the poor, the immigrant or the prisoner. All the evidence proves this preaching is patently false. Under President Obama, millions of people fell into poverty and dependence on the government. But in only two years, President Trump and Republican policies have lifted millions of people out of poverty and into jobs, giving them what they really want: financial independence and the dignity that comes with work, not government handouts.
The free market and regulatory reforms enacted by a Republican-led Congress and President Trump have resulted in a blue-collar recovery, breathing life and jobs into working-class communities that Democrats had written off as expendable collateral damage in the inevitable globalization plans of American and global elites.
President Trump championed and signed into law the greatest reform of our criminal justice system in a generation. The First Step Act is already delivering second chances to prisoners who have served their time and are now living redeemed lives as contributing members of society.
And it is President Trump and the Republican Party who seem to be the only ones who care about the sexual abuse of children and women on the dangerous journey to our southern border. Democrats like Buttigieg are “morally opposed” to fixing an immigration system that incentivizes a sexually exploitative journey for vulnerable children, forced by parents and cartels who use them to game our asylum system. There is nothing compassionate or Christian about that. Buttigieg, like Obama, puts a mild-mannered face on a radical agenda. Look under the hood, though, and the policies look just like those of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez minus the Christian rhetoric. Buttigieg claims moral superiority, but his behavior today – in addition to his failed mayoral record – suggests the opposite. Not to mention that he is the son of a radical, Marxist professor, which might explain the policy positions that are far from being mild, centrist or Christian.

Serious Christian voters know better. We will not be fooled. Nor should we allow ourselves to be scolded by the very people who have been encouraging and profiting from the coarsening and sexualization of our culture for decades.
Whether we like it or not, we all swim in the popular culture cesspool Hollywood created and Democrats endorse, so excuse me if I’m a little desensitized to the tabloid scandals of our president -- a former Democrat. As a Christian voter, I’ll take loud-mouthed President Trump with his colorful, scandalous personal life over “mild-mannered” Buttigieg’s policies any day. Before judging Trump’s faith, or the faith and sincerity of millions of Christian Trump voters, maybe Mayor Pete should take the policy log out of his own eye!

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski is working with a Republican candidate in a longshot bid to dethrone U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y. The freshman congresswoman’s approval rating has dwindled since her election win in November thanks to numerous controversies and a firebrand style that tends to turn off many voters, sparking efforts by both Democrats and Republicans to oust the card-carrying Democratic socialist.
In New York City, Ocasio-Cortez’s favorability rating took a dive after she led an effort to block a deal that would have brought thousands of Amazon jobs to the borough of Queens. Her use of misleading information painted the plan as a massive government giveaway, even though it would have generated billions in tax revenue and 25,000 jobs.

Lewandowski has apparently agreed to serve as an unofficial adviser to Ruth Papazian, a medical journalist, and her campaign to unseat Ocasio-Cortez, New York magazine reported.
Lewandowski was instrumental in helping get then-GOP candidate Donald Trump’s 2016 bid off the ground and into the mainstream -- even as polls and critics deemed his candidacy unlikely.
Papazian told Fox News that her bid to run for Congress against Ocasio-Cortez partly stems from the fiasco over the Amazon deal.
“She parachuted into a congressional district she doesn’t even represent and led the parade of grandstanding politicians to tank the deal,” Papazian said. “Instead of fighting to keep Amazon out of Queens, she should have been fighting to bring Amazon to the Bronx.” “She parachuted into a congressional district she doesn’t even represent and led the parade of grandstanding politicians to tank the deal. Instead of fighting to keep Amazon out of Queens, she should have been fighting to bring Amazon to the Bronx.” — Ruth Papazian
AOC FACES BACKLASH FOR USING 'FIRST THEY CAME ... ' HOLOCAUST POEM IN DEFENSE OF OMAR
That appears to be an issue that could resonate with voters in the district, as 58 percent of the residents there said they actually supported the Amazon deal, according to a Siena College poll.
At the same time, many residents remain supportive of their representative, with the poll finding Ocasio-Cortez has a 52 percent favorability rating among her district's voters and that 48 percent of all voters would vote to re-elect her in 2020.
More importantly, a Republican is likely to struggle in the district as it has historically voted overwhelmingly for Democrats, with the majority of politically active residents being registered Democrats.

Sarah Anderson: President Trump and the GOP commit to second chances,www.foxnews.com,Sarah Anderson,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sarah-anderson-president-trump-and-the-gop-commit-to-second-chances,"During the “Prison Reform Summit and FIRST STEP Act Celebration,” President Trump gave much of his remarks off-script and featured the stories of formerly incarcerated individuals who have benefitted from the landmark legislation. He made abundantly clear his genuine and personal commitment to furthering criminal justice reform efforts in our country. “To recognize the dignity and the potential of every American, I have designated April as the ‘Second Chance Month,’” President Trump said. “As a result of our incredible economic turnaround ... there has never been a better time for those who need a second chance and they get a fresh start.”
A statistic not widely known outside of the sphere of criminal justice reform advocates is that 95 percent of all of those incarcerated in the United States will be returning back into society. It is imperative, then, that we do our best to ensure that those folks coming back into our communities do not commit more crimes upon release. Working toward this goal is a surefire way to reduce crime in every area of our nation and also to bolster the workforce by filling the jobs that our recent economic boom has created.
In a time when politics are so divided, it is encouraging to see that giving second chances to those returning home from prison is something to unify around. Because the First Step Act addressed front-end changes in sentencing laws and implemented prison rehabilitation programs, we will now have individuals coming out of our prisons ready to return to society. But second chances are about making sure that society is also ready for these individuals to return and be successful.
Without a doubt, the second step in justice reform needs to be focused on this issue of offender re-entry into society. To recognize this, bipartisan duos Reps. Mark Walker, R-N.C., and Tony Cárdenas., D-Calif. and Sens. Rob Portman, R-Ohio and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., have introduced resolutions in the House and the Senate to support the designation of April as Second Chance Month.
In passing the First Step Act, Congress chose to follow the lead of a vast number of Republican-led states that have implemented similar measures. Among these states are Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Oklahoma. But it has been a long time coming for Republicans to jump fully on board with criminal justice reform, and it is still a work in progress.
Undoubtedly, the fight to get the First Step Act across the finish line last year was chiefly focused on quelling opposition from Republicans. Right-of-center reform advocates strongly believe what Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, says often about the issue: “I am a supporter of criminal justice reform not in spite of, but because of, my conservatism.”
Lately, it seems as though the Republican Party broadly is increasingly embracing this view. The Republican National Committee is actively featuring President Trump’s commitment to justice reform on its social media, tweeting out video after video from last week’s White House event.
Now that both parties have agreed that justice reform is an important issue to address and have taken steps to do so, the possibilities are endless to make progress toward a fairer and more efficient system, in keeping with our values as Americans. We are committed to providing life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all Americans, and this commitment doesn’t stop when one makes a human error in life. Many have realized that second chances are critical to who we are as a country, and fortunately so. We are all better for it.

Dangerous Android malware comes to the iPhone,www.foxnews.com,Brooke Crothers,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/dangerous-android-malware-comes-to-the-iphone,"FILE- In this Jan. 31, 2019, file photo Grant Thompson and his mother, Michele, look at an iPhone in the family's kitchen in Tucson, Ariz., on Thursday, Jan. 31, 2019. (AP Photo/Brian Skoloff, File) An insidious variety of Android spyware has finally made its way to the iPhone . Early last year, mobile security firm Lookout discovered Android and iOS malware that can steal “contacts, audio recordings, photos, location, and more from devices,"" according to a blog post from the company.
The malware was originally found on the Italian-language Google Play Store for Android and disguised as “service applications ” from mobile operators, according to Security Without Borders which also documented the malware.
TOP IPHONE , ANDROID APPS FOR BLOCKING ROBOCALLS
Versions of the Android malware, dubbed Exodus, were unwittingly installed dozens of times, “with one case reaching over 350,” Security Without Borders said.
A Google spokesperson told Fox News that it ""removed the apps from Google Play earlier this year"" and warned the users who had installed the malware. ""We invest heavily in keeping users safe from bad apps, malicious developers, and new abuse trends,"" the spokesperson added. Now on the iPhone
Lookout's research on the Android version of the malware led to the discovery of it on iOS.
Unlike the Android version, the malware isn’t distributed through the App Store but via the Apple Developer Enterprise program, which allows organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees and bypass the App Store, Lookout said.
However, some malicious groups have exploited this, Domingo Guerra, Senior Director, Modern OS Security, Symantec, told Fox News. These groups “misused the enterprise app certificate ‘loop-hole’ to circumvent the App Store review process and get their apps ‘sideloaded’ onto target devices,” he said.
This is a new twist and potentially a sign of things to come. “The fact that it uses this ‘backdoor’ of the Apple Enterprise Developer Program is fairly novel and likely a new avenue other actors might try to take when targeting iOS users,” Adam Kujawa, Director of Malwarebytes Labs, told Fox News.
Since the App Store is secure, malware purveyors were forced to take an alternative route, Kujawa said. “Apple has a more locked down app store, trying to slip it into the legitimate application repository is pretty much impossible.”
Instead, attackers are setting up phishing sites, pretending to be mobile carriers, Kujawa added. “From these pages, there are links to install what the user believes to be useful applications from their mobile carrier…[but] these links will navigate the user to download the app on their iOS device.”
THE 7 TECHNOLOGICAL WONDERS OF THE 21ST CENTURY
“They are able to do this by having a legitimate enterprise certificate assigned to this app, notably from the company Connexxa S.R.L.,” Kujawa continued.
The iOS version is more limited than the Android variant but still can scrape personal data and listen in to an iPhone’s microphone, Kujawa said. But once Apple was made aware of this, they blacklisted the certificate used by the app."
Charlie Kirk: Game of Thrones vs. Game of Dems – how big is the difference?,www.foxnews.com,Charlie Kirk,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/charlie-kirk-game-of-thrones-vs-game-of-dems-how-big-is-the-difference,"Email
'Game of Thrones' actor Joe Dempsie revealed his secret to staying alive on the hit HBO drama (HBO) America is gripped with anticipation for this weekend’s premiere on HBO of the final season of “ Game of Thrones .” The series has taken its place alongside “The Sopranos” as transcendent entertainment that has become part of America’s cultural landscape. For anyone like me who just simply can’t wait for Sunday, let me suggest a great lead-in drama for your viewing: the Democratic presidential candidate race and the subplot of Joe Biden and Barack Obama.
For anyone not familiar with “Game of Thrones,” let me first offer condolences and then fill you in on the storyline. The show is set in the mythical region of Westeros where seven separate kingdoms are ruled reluctantly under one “Iron Throne.” There are power grabs, treason, assassinations, betrayals, treaties honored and broken, and military insurrections. In other words, it is a medieval-looking portrayal of a journey around today’s globe.
CHARLIE KIRK: THERE WAS COLLUSION – AGAINST TRUMP, BY HIS ENEMIES
There are also “White Walkers,” a legion of frozen undead who have been held outside Westeros and who are now, in the final season, about to enter. These are mindless soldiers focused only upon death and destruction. You cannot speak with them; you cannot reason with them. They are quite similar in nature to the socialists who have now invaded not only the Democratic Party but the party’s presidential field.
So, with the table set for a final conflict in Westeros, pivot with me to view the Democrats’ current tale of plotting and betrayal. I am referring to President Obama and his deafening silence in the Joe Biden skirmish with #MeToo.
Biden served President Obama faithfully for eight years as his vice president, king’s hand in Westeros terms, and never once wavered in his support. This could have been because of Biden’s belief in the president’s agenda. It could have been because of how Biden felt about the president as he expressed back in 2007, saying “I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a storybook, man.”
Or it could have been simply because he was loyal.
Now, as Biden comes under attack, likely an orchestrated attack, from women across our kingdom claiming he touched them or behaved with them in a manner that was inappropriate and made them feel uncomfortable, Barack Obama is standing on the sidelines refusing to come out and defend his former defender and trusted servant.
There has been a great deal of speculation as to why the former president is not stepping in. Articles in publications as wide-ranging as The Hill and Vanity Fair have offered differing ideas and analysis. One source said that unlike President Trump, the former president doesn’t like to try to shape public opinion.
Seriously? This was a man who used his office to step in on all sorts of events, such as back in 2009 when he said police “acted stupidly” in arresting a Harvard professor in his Cambridge home. Likewise, in the Ferguson, Missouri police shooting of Michael Brown, he quickly made comments before facts were known.
Obama has been very willing to weigh in on anything and everything. In fact, he did it this past Saturday in Berlin while speaking at an Obama Foundation event
The former president said: ""One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States, maybe it’s true here as well, is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, ‘Uh, I’m sorry, this is how it’s going to be’ and then we start sometimes creating what’s called a ‘circular firing squad’, where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues. And when that happens, typically the overall effort and movement weakens.”
Well, there he goes weighing in again. A side note: This man who warns of rigidity is the same man who once famously wagged his verbal finger at John McCain and told him that “elections have consequences.”
I will offer you two different possible explanations for Obama’s unwillingness to defend Joe Biden. They are completely opposite in nature, and yet both are completely outside conventional wisdom.
The first is that Obama sees Joe Biden as being far too moderate to be the heir to Obama’s progressive throne. Everything we know about Obama tells us he is radical in his politics and in favor of using government to socially engineer almost every outcome. He is far more in step with Kamala Harris than he is with Joe Biden. He wants Biden’s candidacy to end so that it can’t possibly interfere with a preferable field.
An alternate explanation would make “Game of Thrones” author George R. R. Martin green with plot envy. While I have it on good authority that Michele Obama does not like politics and would never consider running for the presidency, she, her husband, and Democrat experts have to be looking at this current field of lightweight misfits and realizing that if she stepped into the race she could likely win the nomination without having to get out of bed each morning before 11 a.m. Given the current American obsession with celebrity, discounting her as a formidable candidate would be a mistake.

As I and a large, dedicated audience eagerly brace for this Sunday night, a much larger audience, the audience of American citizens, braces for the 2020 election and the Democrat primary that precedes it. In Westeros, nothing is ever quite as it seems, and nobody can ever truly be trusted. There are things going on behind the scenes with the Democrats that are likely unseemly. Remember how they conspired to destroy the candidacy of Bernie Sanders just a few years ago.
All of this Democrat mischief and intrigue revolves around choosing who will do battle with President Trump in 2020. Democrats would do well to remember that the president brings dragons to the fight. Charlie Kirk is the founder and executive director of Turning Point USA, an advocacy group for young conservatives.

Golden Knights tie series with Sharks with 5-3 win in Game 2,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/stanley-cup-playoffs-2019-golden-knights-sharks-game-2,"Then, the referee waved it off for goalie interference and gave Vegas a power play that changed the momentum of the game and possibly the series. Mark Stone scored the tiebreaking goal on that power play and the Golden Knights responded after the first-period collapse to beat the Sharks 5-3 on Friday night to tie their playoff series at one game apiece.
""For our power play to come out and really bear down was obviously a big swing,"" Stone said. ""There&apos;s momentum swings in playoff games every night. Every game is a new chapter in a series and tonight was a big win for us.""
The teams packed an entire game into the opening minutes with the Golden Knights scoring three goals in the first 6:11 and the Sharks rallying for three more in the final 3:01 to become the first team in NHL history to tie a playoff game in the first period after falling behind 3-0.
The craziness continued at the start of the second period when the Sharks briefly celebrated an apparent goal in the opening minute by Brent Burns. That quickly turned to frustration when the officials waved off the goal because Logan Couture interfered with Marc-Andre Fleury, giving the Golden Knights the power play that led to the game-winning goal.
""It was awesome,"" Vegas coach Gerard Gallant said. ""It was definitely the right call. He hit him in the head. He tried to play the puck, he was defending his goal, he&apos;s trying to play the puck and a guy skates through the blue paint and bumps him in the head. To me, it&apos;s pretty obvious. I don&apos;t know what they&apos;re saying down there.""
Predictably, that wasn&apos;t the view from the Sharks side, with coach Peter DeBoer calling it a ""travesty."" DeBoer said he believed Fleury was outside the crease when contact was made and was upset the referee called a penalty on what he thought was incidental contact because that prevented a chance at a replay review.
""That one call is a two-goal swing and devastating for our group,"" DeBoer said. ""It&apos;s a shame.""
Stone converted from the slot after a scramble for his third goal of the series and Vegas held on from there, thanks in part to 34 saves from Fleury.
Cody Eakin, Colin Miller and Max Pacioretty all scored in the first period to stake the Golden Knights to the big lead after losing the opener 5-2. William Karlsson added a short-handed goal in the third to ice it.
Game 3 will be Sunday night in Las Vegas.
Couture, Tomas Hertl and Joe Thornton scored for the Sharks, who were doomed by the lackluster start and a poor power play. Martin Jones was pulled for Aaron Dell after allowing three goals on seven shots.
Perhaps even more concerning for San Jose was the fact that defenseman Marc-Edouard Vlasic left after blocking a shot in the second period and didn&apos;t return. Couture also missed significant time in the second period after being hit in the groin area by a shot but returned for the third.
The Sharks had chances to tie it with an early power play, but allowed a goal on a breakaway from Karlsson instead to fall behind 5-3. They finished 1 for 8 with the man advantage, along with allowing two short-handed goals.
""We just got outworked, plain and simple,"" forward Evander Kane said. ""We can&apos;t give up two short-handed goals and expect to win in the postseason. We just got outworked.""
Gallant had been unhappy with the compete level of his team in the opener, but that wasn&apos;t a problem early as Eakin scored just 58 seconds into the game after being left alone in the slot and the Golden Knights controlling the play early.
They even killed off one minute of a two-man advantage and scored a short-handed goal just after Colin Miller came back on the ice as he stole a back pass from Erik Karlsson and beat Jones on the rush to make it 2-0.
Pacioretty added his goal less than two minutes later after a turnover from Vlasic and it appeared as if the rout was on before a reckless penalty by Miller negated a Vegas power play.
The Sharks got on the board during 4-on-4 play with tic-tac-toe passing from Karlsson to Pavelski to Couture, who put the puck into an open net.
Karlsson&apos;s shot from the point on the man advantage deflected off Hertl to make it a one-goal game and Thornton tied it with 52 seconds left in the period when he redirected a pass from Brenden Dillon after Evander Kane&apos;s hustle created the scoring chance.
NOTES: Miller played in place of Nick Holden after sitting in the opener. He scored the short-handed goal, but also took two penalties. ... Jones has been pulled in five of 14 career starts against Vegas.

"Eberle, Bailey help Islanders beat Penguins 3-1 in Game 2",www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/stanley-cup-playoffs-2019-islanders-penguins-game-2,"Jordan Eberle and Josh Bailey scored less than four minutes apart in the final period and the Islanders beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 3-1 Friday night for a 2-0 lead in their first-round playoff series. ""You can&apos;t get too emotional, get too down and get frustrated,"" New York captain Anders Lee said. ""We were playing a good game at the time (Pittsburgh scored), but there was plenty of time left.""
Anthony Beauvillier had the tying goal midway through the second and Robin Lehner stopped 32 shots to help New York open a postseason series with two wins for the first time since sweeping Edmonton in the 1983 Stanley Cup Final for the Islanders&apos; fourth straight championship.
Mathew Barzal had two assists in a chippy, physical game that featured a lot of hard hits and some skirmishes, especially in the first two periods — and also after the final buzzer.
""We stayed with it all night,"" New York coach Barry Trotz said. ""Both teams were knocking heads for a while there. ... We got opportunities and we capitalized on them, and we got a big save when we needed it.""
Erik Gudbranson scored and Matt Murray finished with 31 saves for the Penguins, who have lost the first two games of a postseason series for the first time since the 2013 Eastern Conference finals against Boston.
Game 3 is Sunday at Pittsburgh.
""We&apos;ve got to go back to our building and worry about one game,"" Murray said. ""That&apos;s it.""
The Islanders took the lead after a turnover by the Penguins near their own blue line. Barzal sent the puck up to Eberle on the right side and he skated across the front and sent a backhand in at 7:54 of the third to put New York up 2-1.
Bailey, who had the overtime winner in Game 1 on Wednesday night, then gave the Islanders a two-goal lead with a power-play score with 8:22 remaining on New York&apos;s sixth man-advantage of the night. Devon Toews fired a shot that hit Lee, and the puck came to Bailey, who put it in from the right side.
The Islanders struggled on the power play all season, going 3 for 50 over the final 22 games to finish 29th in the NHL at 14.5 percent. They had one goal on their first seven chances of this series before Bailey&apos;s score.
""We kind of talked earlier in the week, just our power play not killing momentum,"" Lee said. ""We might not score every time, but to have a good showing, get some shots, create some buzz around us and start feeling the puck. We had a good showing with that. Guys just stuck with it.""
The Penguins pulled Murray for an extra skater with 2:44 remaining, but couldn&apos;t take advantage. Lehner made a nice glove save on Phil Kessel from the right circle, drawing chants of ""Leh-ner! Leh-ner!"" from the raucous home crowd.
""He was stellar, he made some huge saves,"" Eberle said. ""A couple that seemed they had an &apos;A&apos; chance at. He&apos;s been huge all year.""
The Islanders had a 5-on-3 advantage for about a minute in the second period, but couldn&apos;t beat Murray. The Penguins goalie then had a diving stop on Matt Martin in front about 7:44 in, and a stick save on a slap shot by Ryan Pulock 10 seconds later.
Brian Dumoulin hit a goalpost for Pittsburgh at about the 9-minute mark.
Gudbranson then gave the Penguins their first lead of the series when he took a pass from Evgeni Malkin and fired a one-timer that beat Lehner&apos;s blocker side and went in off the post with 9:24 remaining in the second. It was Gudbranson&apos;s first career playoff point.
It lasted less than three minutes.
Beauvillier tied it with 6:35 left in the period with his first career playoff goal as he knocked in the loose puck in front after Murray was out of position following a save on Barzal&apos;s initial try on a 3-on-2 break
While some of the Islanders began celebrating the goal, fights broke out to Murray&apos;s left. Barzal was given a double-minor for roughing, while Pittsburgh&apos;s Marcus Pettersson received a 2-minute penalty.
The Islanders outshot the Penguins 11-7 in the scoreless first period.
NOTES: Murray has lost consecutive playoff games for the fourth time. He also did it in Games 3 and 4 of 2017 Stanley Cup Final against Nashville, and Games 2-3 and 5-6 against Washington in second round last year. ... Penguins F Jared McCann sat out due to an upper-body injury. He was replaced in the lineup by F Teddy Blueger, making his playoff debut. D Jack Johnson was back in the lineup after sitting out Game 1. He had played in all 82 games during the regular season. D Olli Maatta sat out to make room. ... New York was 38-2-2 in regular season when scoring at least 3 goals, and is now 2-0 in playoffs.

New York GOP lawmaker looks to overturn Dems' block of bill expanding college tuition for Gold Star families,www.foxnews.com,Lukas Mikelionis,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-gop-democrats-college-tuition-gold-star-families,"“This is one of those things of misplaced priorities that needs to be simply fixed as quickly as possible,” said Robert Smullen, who’s also a retired Marine, on Saturday morning. “This is one of those things of misplaced priorities that needs to be simply fixed as quickly as possible.”
— Republican New York Assemblyman Robert Smullen “This was blocked in a committee vote. It needs to come out into the assembly onto the floor so it can be debated and then actually, I think the governor will sign it, he has indicated that he would. It&apos;s really time for action. It&apos;s a time for us to take care of the families of our service members who are fallen.”
The Assembly’s Higher Education Committee voted 15 to 11 on Tuesday to shelve the bill, meaning it won’t be going to the floor for debate and a vote.
The move comes just a week after the state approved $27 million for a program allowing illegal immigrants to qualify for state aid for higher education.
“This is a bipartisan thing. So, it is a process of procedural foul that needs to be corrected as quickly as possible. That&apos;s really where leadership comes in. If we lead properly, we would then be able to take care,” Smullen said, noting that the bill proposing aid to Gold Star families has been blocked for years.
“We have been working very hard to make sure this is an inclusive program. So it includes those who are killed in combat but also those that are killed in the line of duty. And it makes it an equitable thing so those people that go forward that do our duty, they do their oath to the Constitution to support and defend, they know that we got their backs covered and that their families will be taken care of,” he added.
Video New York Democrats defended the blocking of the bill, saying the aid to Gold Star families was not within the state&apos;s budget and noted that there’s a similar program that provides $2.7 million to 145 students who are dependents of veterans who served in combat zones.
Mike Whyland, a spokesman for Assembly Democrats, said the Republican-led bill “would have expanded the eligibility beyond the scope and should be considered within the context of the budget.”
But Smullen reiterates that supporting Gold Star families “should absolutely be our first priority” and points to the recent death of Christopher Slutman, Marine reservist and a member of New York City Fire Department, who was killed on Monday by a roadside bomb near a U.S. base in Afghanistan.
“When you think about it, we as a society, as a civilization, and New York particularly, ought to be a leader in this nation to take care of those who need it most. And, you know, we just had a marine reservist killed in Afghanistan. A member of FDNY, very tragic.""
— Republican New York Assemblyman Robert Smullen “When you think about it, we as a society, as a civilization, and New York particularly, ought to be a leader in this nation to take care of those who need it most. And, you know, we just had a marine reservist killed in Afghanistan. A member of FDNY, very tragic,” Smullen said.
“We need to be thinking most about their families in times like this. Our condolences to them. Also to be able to say we have got your back. We have got this covered. So, you, as a service member, can always do the right thing knowing that your family is going to be taken care of.”
The Republican legislator then urged people to call up their representatives and demand them to bring the measure to a vote, pass it, and get the governor to sign it.

Kirsten Gillibrand, N.Y., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., does not speak directly about immigrants but refers to covering U.S. “residents” instead. Both Sanders’ bill in the Senate, and a corresponding House bill introduced by Reps. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., would extend coverage to every U.S. resident -- a shift from the Affordable Care Act, which limited benefits to citizens, nationals and “lawfully present” immigrants. The House bill also prohibits the government from denying benefits because of ""citizenship status.""
While the Health and Human Services Secretary is given the task of defining residency, the federal government is tasked with taking steps to ensuring that “every person in the United States has access to health care, The Washington Examiner notes.
Sanders told CBS News&apos; Ed O&apos;Keefe , that his bill ""guarantees, like every other major country on Earth, health care to every man, woman and child in this country.""
He told The Washington Post : ""My plan would cover every U.S. resident.""
Such provisions are not new for Sanders, who has in the past pushed plans that would not exclude those in the country illegally. But it does mark a change for the 2020 field as a whole, which has moved dramatically to the left. Sanders’ bill would also mostly abolish private health insurance. Some estimates put the cost up to $32 trillion over the next decade.
Neither the House nor the Senate bill is likely to be made law while Republicans control the Senate and the White House. Republicans would almost certainly oppose either bill as a bloc, but even on the Democratic side, the plan could face significant resistance.
Video House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in February that Medicare-for-all” may not be “as good a benefit as the Affordable Care Act.”
“It doesn’t have catastrophic [coverage] -- you have to go buy it. It doesn’t have dental. It’s not as good as the plans that you can buy under the Affordable Care Act,” she told Rolling Stone in an interview. “So I say to them, come in with your ideas, but understand that we’re either gonna have to improve Medicare — for all, including seniors — or else people are not gonna get what they think they’re gonna get,” she said. “And by the way, how’s it gonna be paid for?”
As to the broader concept of a single-payer plan, she put the cost at $30 trillion and asked: “Now, how do you pay for that?”
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., expressed skepticism this week, saying it was just one of several proposals the party is considering: ""Different Democrats have different ways to get there.""
But the pushback from Democratic leadership has not stopped the shift left by both House freshmen and 2020 presidential candidates, particularly on the thorny topic of illegal immigration.
Former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro has called for illegal immigration to be treated as a civil, rather than a criminal matter. Meanwhile Gillibrand, as part of her call for “comprehensive immigration reform,” suggested that she wants to expand Social Security to those in the country illegally.
""First, we need comprehensive immigration reform,"" she said last month in Iowa. ""If you are in this country now you must have the right to pay into Social Security, to pay your taxes, to pay into the local school system and to have a pathway to citizenship. That must happen.""

"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez thanks Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren for defending Ilhan Omar after Trump’s 9/11 video",www.foxnews.com,Kathleen Joyce,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-ilhan-omar-trump-september-11,"Ocasio-Cortez, 29, called on members of Congress to respond to Trump’s “explicit attack today.” “Ilhan Omar’s life is in danger. For our colleagues to be silent is to be complicit in the outright, dangerous targeting of a member of Congress. We must speak out,” she tweeted Friday.
The freshman congresswoman thanked Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for applauding Omar’s “strength and courage.”
“She won’t back down to Trump’s racism and hate, and neither will we. The disgusting and dangerous attacks against her end,” Sanders tweeted.
Ocasio-Cortez then thanked Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for calling out others who refused to condemn Trump’s video.
“The President is inciting against a sitting Congresswoman – and an entire group of Americans based on their religion. It’s disgusting. It’s shameful. And any elected leader who refuses to condemn it shares responsibility for it,” Warren tweeted.
“Thank you for standing up for all of us, Sen. Elizabeth Warren,” Ocasio-Cortez said.
The New York congresswoman retweeted comments from others who defended Omar including 2020 presidential contender Julian Castro and Rep. Antonio Delgado, D-N.Y. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi commented on Trump&apos;s video, saying ""The president shouldn&apos;t use the painful images of 9/11 for a political attack.""
“As we visit our troops in Stuttgart to thank them and be briefed by them, we honor our first responsibility as leaders to protect and defend the American people. It is wrong for the President, as Commander-in-Chief, to fan the flames to make anyone less safe,"" Pelosi said in a statement.
Trump’s video pulled a snippet of Omar’s speech last month to the Council on American-Islamic Relations in which she described the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center as ""some people did something,"" as well as news footage of the hijacked planes hitting the towers. Trump on Friday tweeted, ""WE WILL NEVER FORGET!""
In the speech, Omar, who is one of the first Muslim women to serve in Congress, told CAIR in Los Angeles that many Muslims saw their civil liberties eroded after the attacks, and she advocated for activism.
""For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I&apos;m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,"" she said in the March 23 speech, according to video posted online. ""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.""
CAIR was founded in 1994, according to its website, but its membership increased dramatically following the attacks.
Her comments prompted responses from Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, who called her remarks ""unbelievable."" Thursday’s cover of the New York Post addressed her remarks with a front page that featured an infamous photo of New York City’s Twin Towers on fire on the day of the attacks.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard , the young Missouri woman who is serving a 10-year prison sentence for second-degree murder in her mother’s death, is reportedly engaged to her boyfriend after he began writing to her when he watched the documentary about her case. Blanchard, 27, reportedly told her friends and family that she and her boyfriend, who was not named, are getting married, according to a family friend.
“They are very happy,” Fancy Macelli, a family friend, told People. “You can hear excitement in her voice.”
GYPSY ROSE BLANCHARD SAYS SHE ‘FELT LIKE A PRISONER’ BEFORE MOTHER’S FATAL STABBING
The couple reportedly became pen pals before they began dating and have known each other for 1 1/2 years. Macelli said the man began writing to Blanchard after he watched “Mommy Dead and Dearest,” the HBO documentary that premiered in 2017. The documentary followed the case of Blanchard and her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard, 48, who was stabbed to death in 2015.
Macelli said the couple will not get married until Blanchard is released from prison and called the relationship a “good thing for her.”

“And whether it ends up being that way in the end no one knows, but for her right now it’s a very positive and happy time,” Macelli said.
Dee Dee Blanchard allegedly suffered from a mental illness called Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP), which occurs when a person attempts to produce psychological or physical symptoms in another person. Relatives said Blanchard was forced by her mother to use a wheelchair and undergo unnecessary medical procedures.
PATRICIA ARQUETTE TAKES ON SHOCKING GYPSY ROSE CRIME IN ‘THE ACT’: THE MOM-DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP WAS ‘TOXIC’
Blanchard testified in November that she asked ex-boyfriend Nicholas Godejohn to kill her mother. Blanchard said her mother physically abused her and controlled her life. She said she thought killing her mom was the only way out and she talked Godejohn into coming to Missouri to kill her mother. The two met on a Christian dating site.
Blanchard’s story has spawned numerous TV specials, including the HBO documentary and the Hulu series “The Act,” which stars Patricia Arquette as Dee Dee and Joey King as Gypsy Rose Blanchard.

Kevin Jennings: 'Our country is FULL?' I’ve heard it before,www.foxnews.com,Kevin Jennings,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kevin-jennings-our-country-is-full-ive-heard-it-before,"Jeff Paul reports. “Our country is FULL.” “If you open the borders , my God, there’s a lot of poverty in this world, and you’re going to have people from all over the world. And I don’t think that’s something we can do at this point. Can’t do it.”
“I believe that this nation is the last hope of Western civilization and if this oasis of the world shall be overrun, perverted, contaminated or destroyed, then the last flickering light of humanity will be extinguished. … Today, as never before, untold millions are storming our gates for admission and those gates are cracking under the strain.”
MARC THIESSEN: YES, AMERICA NEEDS WALLS. BUT THE COUNTRY IS NOT 'FULL'
You probably recognize the first quote, tweeted out Sunday by President Trump. You may even recognize the second quote, made by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in response to a question at a campaign event on the same day in Oskaloosa, Iowa (and which seems to prove that no party has a monopoly on xenophobia).
But which politician uttered the third? Surely this warning of the “untold millions … storming our gates for admission” must be from someone trying to appeal to the current wave of anti-immigrant hysteria sweeping our country, right?
Wrong. The author of the third quote is Sen. Pat McCarran, D-Nev. He was speaking not this week, but in March of 1953, almost exactly 66 years ago.
Somehow, despite McCarran’s apocalyptic warnings, the United States has survived for the nearly seven decades since he uttered that statement.
In fact, critics of immigration have always warned of “alien hordes” that are threatening our way of life. The composition of these hordes has evolved over time: from Irish Catholics to Chinese “coolies” to Eastern European Jews (just like Bernie’s dad, who arrived during the “open borders” era in 1921) to today’s Latino and Muslim immigrants. The names of the bogeymen change, but the rhetoric defaming them stays disturbingly the same.
Somehow America is always on the verge of being swamped by a wave of newcomers that “will soon so outnumber us that ... we will not in my opinion be able to preserve our language, and even our government will become precarious” (the words of Ben Franklin in 1751, raising the alarm about the influx of Germans into Pennsylvania). Yet, somehow, America always perseveres.
How is it that our supposedly full nation seems to always survive these onslaughts of “aliens?” Because of two factors.
First, despite the rhetoric from the likes of Trump, Sanders, and McCarran, we weren’t “full” in the past and we’re not “full” now. In fact, our labor force is barely growing at all (0.5 percent annually, according to the Congressional Budget Office), which is a major factor in today’s economic growth rates not being as robust as they were in the “golden era” of the post-World War II baby boom.
According to The New York Times, overall population growth is now at its lowest point since the Great Depression, and 80 percent of America’s counties are actually experiencing negative population growth among working-age adults, contributing to acute labor shortages in some geographic areas and specific industries.
With an expanding elderly population, this is a recipe for disaster. The Times reports that by 2035 if current trends continue there will be 2.2 workers for each Social Security beneficiary (down from 2.8 currently), imposing an increasingly crushing and unsustainable tax burden upon the working population.
Where will the home health care aides, the nurses, and the other service workers that meet the needs of the elderly – jobs often taken by immigrants – come from if immigration is cut off and the already low birth rates among native-born Americans continue to decline? Do the math: America is not full, and cutting off the flow of immigrants could have disastrous economic results for those of us who already live here.
Second, American culture is remarkably resilient and has proven itself to have an amazing absorptive capacity. Take, for example, Benjamin Franklin’s claim, writing in 1751 in his “Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind,"" that “our government will become precarious” due to the influx of inassimilable immigrants.
In 1924, nearly a century ago, the U.S. passed the National Origins Act, establishing strict national quotas designed primarily to exclude Southern and Eastern Europeans who were deemed inassimilable in part because they practiced unfamiliar faiths, namely Catholicism and Judaism.
Imagine how shocked the sponsors of the National Origins Act would have been on June 28, 2010, when Justice John Paul Stevens retired, leaving a Supreme Court composed entirely of Catholic and Jewish justices. Somehow, America had absorbed these “aliens” into the highest court of its land, and its traditions of jurisprudence had survived.
Another claim, made by Franklin and repeated down to today by immigrant critics, is that newcomers simply won’t learn “our” language (English) and that this problem is especially acute among today’s immigrants, who – unlike the “good” immigrants of yesteryear – cling to their native languages.
Once again, American culture has proven to be remarkably absorptive in this regard. In fact, Latinos – the group against which this charge is usually leveled – learn English more quickly than some prior immigrant communities of the past did.
A University of Wisconsin study found that, while 92 percent of second-generation Latino immigrants speak English “very well,” in the 1800s 35 percent of second-generation German immigrants in some counties in that state spoke no English at all. Immigrants learn quickly that the path to success in America involves mastery of the English language, and they tend to get with the program pretty fast.
Critics of immigration paint a scary picture, one where alien swarms practicing strange religions and speaking unfamiliar tongues (and refusing to learn English) are “invading” our already full country, imposing upon us a burden we simply cannot absorb.
History proves that’s been hogwash in the past, and it’s hogwash now. If we believed those who said America was “full” in the past, many of our ancestors might not have gotten into this country (indeed, Bernie’s father barely beat the 1924 National Origins Act cutoff), and the loss to America would have been incalculable (although, as 44 percent of our Fortune 500 companies were started by immigrants or their children, we can guess).

If we fall for the same tired rhetoric today -- rhetoric that has no grounding in either historic or present-day facts -- who knows what we will lose, what future Andrew Carnegie (who came here as an “unskilled” teenager in 1858 and who, at his death, was the third richest person in human history) or Steve Jobs (whose father came to the U.S. from Syria after experiencing political persecution) we might exclude.
The purveyors of fear of immigrants are asking you to bet against America’s ability to absorb newcomers. History shows we have done it before and I am betting we can do it again.

A spokesperson for the embassy told the Telegraph that since the perpetrator posed a threat to the ambassador, an armed police officer had to open fire and shoot at the driver through the window an unknown number of times. No people were injured.
“Nevertheless, despite the police actions, the attacker hit the Ambassador’s car again. In response, the police were forced to open fire on the perpetrator’s vehicle. The culprit was apprehended and taken to a police station,” the statement noted.
Some reports suggested there were shots from the car that hit the ambassador’s vehicle, but the embassy said only the British police opened fire.
Details concerning the motive for the attack, or the man’s nationality and any other information remains unclear.
“No one of the Embassy staff were injured. The police are investigating the suspect’s identity and motive for the attack,” it added.
Some residents told the media outlets that they heard about 10 shots in the area, though that remains unconfirmed.

Poll workers journey to reach India’s most remote voters,www.foxnews.com,AMRIT DHILLON,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/poll-workers-journey-to-reach-indias-most-remote-voters/,"13 Apr
In this April 10, 2019, photo, Indian election officials and paramilitary soldiers with election materials walk along the river Brahmaputra to board on a country boat on the eve of the first phase of general election in Majuli, Assam, India. (AP Photo/Anupam Nath, File) NEW DELHI – The figures involved in India’s general election are staggering: 900 million voters, 83 million first-time voters, 11 million poll workers, nearly 4 million electronic voting machines, 1 million polling booths and 570 special trains for migrant laborers and security personnel. Such numbers convey the scale of the world’s biggest democratic exercise. But its smaller numbers that show India’s commitment to reach every voter, no matter how remote.
In India’s six-week marathon election that began this week, the Election Commission has ruled that no voter should have to travel more than 2 kilometers, or just over a mile, from their home to cast a ballot, whether they live on a Himalayan peak or an island in the Bay of Bengal.
The polling booth in Gir Forest National Park in Gujarat is set up for the sole human inhabitant, a Hindu priest who lives among the lions. Polling officials hike for a whole day to reach the remote village of Malogam in Arunachal Pradesh, where just one woman is registered to vote.
Poll workers must be in superb physical condition to cross mountains, rivers, deserts, forests and national parks. The work entails arduous journeys by train, road, helicopter and boat, accompanied by porters who carry the briefcase-sized voting machines, registers, ink and other election paraphernalia on their backs.
In Arunachal Pradesh, a state in India’s northeast that borders Bhutan, China and Myanmar and where voting took place Thursday, most polling stations are located inside dense, Himalayan forest.
Poll workers set off a week before the vote. The first leg of the journey was a three-hour drive from Changlang, a district in the east, to the city of Maio, a tourist destination 100 kilometers (62 miles) away.
From Maio, the next stop was Vijoynagar, some 163 kilometers (101 miles) away, via the Namdapha National Park. No road connects the two towns, and the terrain is subject to frequent flash floods and landslides. Journeys here are measured in days rather than hours.
So, the team reached Vijoynagar by Indian Air Force helicopter. In pre-monsoon time, bad weather can force the pilot to abort several attempts. That’s why a week’s leeway is given to the team. If all else fails, it’s six days to reach Vijoynagar by foot.
From Vijoynagar, the caravan walked the final leg of their odyssey to the polling station of Gandhigram. It is only 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from Vijoynagar but the trek takes eight hours, through eerily dark jungles where no sunlight steals through the canopy and under constant threat of an ambush by a herd of elephants.
Majestic gorges were crossed on casually strung, flimsy bamboo suspension bridges that wobble like jelly in strong winds. The team traveled with torches, water filters and emergency lights, and a local guide who knows the jungle.
“These are not Alpine tracks. These are sub-tropical forests with thick undergrowth. There is no stated rule, but we prefer people under 45 because a lot of stamina and energy are required,” said Kaling Tayeng, the chief electoral officer of Arunachal Pradesh.
The marathon expedition to Gandhigram was all for 242 voters.
In the Ladakh region of Indian-controlled Kashmir in the north, a polling station at an altitude of 4,327 meters (14,196 feet) is being set up for only 12 voters.
Another Ladakh station, Anlay Pho, is so high at 4,500 meters (almost 15,000 feet) above sea level that polling teams must carry oxygen tanks.
When Winston Churchill described India as a “geographical expression” no more a united nation than the equator, he was speaking to the diversity in landscapes that makes the Election Commission’s job so challenging.
At the other extreme of the country from the mountain peaks of Ladakh are the low-lying Andaman and Nicobar Islands where voting machines were transported by various seafaring vessels for Thursday’s vote.
The polling station at Pilopatia, just 9.7 meters (32 feet) above sea level, is famous for the trouble it presents election officials.
Officials start off on a 24-hour by ship journey from Port Blair, then by speedboat, then by small dinghy and finally by a “hodi,” or traditional boat used by the local tribe, said Dr. Monica Priyadarshini, a Nicobar district election officer.
“In places, the waters are infested with crocodiles and sea snakes,” Priyadarshini said.
The voting machines were protected inside waterproof boxes and other polling material was kept dry under layers of plastic cover. The journey ended with a splash: Priyadarshini and the team clambered out and waded through waist-high water to reach the shore. All this for just nine voters.
Many polling booths in remote areas have no mobile connectivity. Here too, the team had to use wireless sets and satellite phones to send the commission’s mandated twice hourly reports on the progress of polling.
“I had voted in elections, but I never had any idea of the work that goes into ensuring that every single vote is cast,” Priyadarshini said.
In Chhattisgarh, central India, where some polling stations were open this week, it is both geography and ideology that present problems. The jungles are thick with vegetation and teeming with Maoist insurgents called Naxalites who attack government officials with bullets, incendiary devices and land mines.
Earlier this week, insurgents attacked a convoy of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, killing a state party lawmaker and four other people in his vehicle with an improvised explosive device.
“We had 100 high security zones that are very dangerous. In some of them, over 100 security personnel accompanied just 20 polling officials to secure their path through the forest,” said Chhattisgarh police chief Durgesh Kumar Awasthi. “My men haven’t slept for days.” This entry was posted in H1-B News , Immigration and tagged H1B Visa News , Immigration News .

Court temporarily blocks halt to Trump policy forcing asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico,www.foxnews.com,Louis Casiano,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/court-temporarily-blocks-halt-to-trump-policy-forcing-asylum-seekers-to-stay-in-mexico/,"Court temporarily blocks halt to Trump policy forcing asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico Posted on 13 Apr A federal appeals court on Friday temporarily halted a ruling that would have stopped the Trump administration from forcing asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico as they wait for immigration courts to hear their cases. The decision by the three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked a lower ruling from taking effect and gave civil liberties groups until Tuesday to submit arguments on why the asylum policy should be put on hold. The government has until Wednesday to argue why it should remain in place.
On Monday, a federal judge halted the change to the asylum system, saying it violated U.S. law by failing to evaluate the dangers to migrants while in Mexico . The suit was filed by 11 Central American asylum-seekers and advocacy groups who argue forcing asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico puts migrants risk given the uptick in violence there.
AS BORDER CRISIS WORSENS, IMMIGRATION BILLS IN CONGRESS CONTINUE TO STALL

Thousands have fled Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador in recent months amid growing gang violence and abject poverty in the region. The ruling comes as more than 2,000 migrants made their way through Mexico on Friday, hoping to reach the U.S.-Mexico border. Mexican authorities said around 350 migrants broke the locks on a gate at the Guatemalan border Friday and forced their way into the country.
The government is asking the 9th Circuit to keep the asylum policy while the lawsuit makes its way through the courts. It argued halting it would endanger the public.

Families seeking asylum are typically released in the U.S. with notices to appear in court. The new policy began in January at the nation’s busiest border crossing in San Diego. More than 1,300 asylum-seekers have been to Mexico so far, according to the Mexican government.

“I haven’t heard of anyone who’s been sent back since the judge’s order on Monday,” American Civil Liberties Union attorney Judy Rabinovitz said.
The Trump administration has said its stance on asylum is a response to a shortage of detention space for migrants and overwhelmed immigration officials as more migrants appear at the border each day.

"Dutch fertility doctor secretly fathered 49 children, DNA tests reveal",www.foxnews.com,Kathleen Joyce,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/dutch-fertility-doctor-secretly-fathered-49-children-dna-tests-reveal,"Jan Karbaat, who died in April 2017 at the age of 89, impregnated patients at his clinic in Bijdorp, near Rotterdam, a port city in South Holland, the BBC reported. The clinic shuttered in 2009. DNA tests results were announced Friday after a court ruled in February to “release his DNA,” which was taken off items like a toothbrush. A group of the doctor’s suspected children and their parents took Karbaat to court in 2017 following suspicions that they may all be related. The doctor inseminated his patients with his sperm instead of using that of chosen donors.
DNA tests showed Karbaat fathered 49 children, according to Defence for Children International, which helped the case. Many of the children are now in their thirties, Sky News reported.
Tim Bueters, a lawyer who represented the children, told Dutch broadcaster NOS that “there is finally clarity for the children who are matched.”
One of Karbaat’s children said he is glad to have the truth confirmed.
""After a search of 11 years I can continue my life. I am glad that I finally have clarity.""

Republicans renew calls for US-UK trade deal amid Brexit delay,www.foxnews.com,Adam Shaw,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-renew-calls-for-us-uk-trade-deal-amid-brexit-delay,"“If the U.K. regains control over its national trade policy, our two nations will have a once-in-a-generation chance to forge an ambitious trade pact - a truly free, fair, and reciprocal agreement that will foster economic growth, spur innovation, and define a new global standard in trade,” Rep. George Holding, R-N.C., wrote in an op-ed for the Daily Telegrap h this week. Holding, who is the ranking Republican of the British American Parliamentary Group and co-chair of the Congressional U.K. Caucus, wrote that a U.S.-U.K. free trade agreement is a “top priority” for the U.S. He said that President Trump is ""extremely supportive of such a deal as are many Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress.""
“With the U.K. no longer restrained by Brussels’ command-and-control bureaucracy and its heavy-handed regulatory tendencies, we can finally realize the full economic potential a sovereign Britain presents,” he wrote.
Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016, a vote that then-candidate Donald Trump and other Republicans supported, but the British government has struggled to implement the result.
Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement, negotiated with Brussels last year, has been voted down three times by Parliament, and last week U.K. and E.U. leaders negotiated an extension until Oct. 31. It had initially been scheduled to leave the bloc in March. The country cannot negotiate a free trade deal until after the U.K. exits the E.U.
Amid calls in the U.K. for a second referendum or a “softer” Brexit from British lawmakers in favor of staying in the bloc, those in favor of a “harder” Brexit have repeatedly pointed to the possibility of a generous U.S.-U.K. trade deal as an example of the benefits that will come from the U.K. leaving the E.U. -- and warned against a deal that would limit that ability to negotiate its own deals.
Video “All that remains to be seen are the exact terms under which Great Britain will leave the European Union,” Holding wrote. “An exit agreement that ties Britain too closely to the EU would effectively render a bilateral trade deal with the United States impossible.”
National Security Adviser John Bolton told Reuters in a recent interview that President Trump is very eager to cut a bilateral trade deal with an independent Britain.”
“It’s very complicated inside Britain,” Bolton said. “I know they’re going through a lot of turmoil. But really I think the president would like to reassure the people of the United Kingdom how strongly we feel, that we want to be there when they do come out of the European Union.”
Those remarks came days after Trump tweeted: ""My administration looks forward to negotiating a large scale Trade Deal with the United Kingdom. The potential is unlimited!”
The same day, in the Oval Office alongside Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, Trump said he was ""surprised at how badly it&apos;s all gone from the standpoint of a negotiation"" and said that May didn&apos;t listen to his advice on how to negotiate with the E.U. He also said that a second referendum would be ""unfair.""
""I hate to see everything being ripped apart right now, I don&apos;t think another vote would be possible because it would be very unfair to the people that won that say: &apos;What do you mean you&apos;re going to take another vote?&apos;"" he said. ""So that would be tough.""

California woman who attacked McDonald’s manager over ketchup pleads guilty,www.foxnews.com,Janine Puhak,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/california-woman-who-attacked-mcdonalds-manager-over-ketchup-pleads-guilty,"On April 12, Mayra Berenice Gallo was sentenced to 18 days behind bars and 15 days of community service for the October 2018 incident, which unfolded at a Santa Ana location of the fast food chain, NBC 4 reports . The 24-year-old woman, also of Santa Ana, has additionally been ordered to enroll in an anger-management course and has been placed on informal probation for three years.
Mayra Berenice Gallo, 24, was arrested Wednesday for allegedly punching and choking a McDonald's employee in Santa Ana, Calif. (Santa Ana Police Department)
Back in the fall, Gallo entered the Mickey D’s through the employee back door in search of ketchup because she allegedly “didn’t get her ketchup, or enough [of the condiment]"" with the meal she had ordered at the drive-thru, a restaurant staffer told the OC Register.
Though a manager told the woman they’d be “glad” to help her if she entered through the front of the restaurant, Gallo “became combative,” as per KABC-TV.
Surveillance video reportedly shows Gallo slamming the employee’s head into drink machines.
Though other employees of the McDonald’s tried and failed to intervene, Gallo did not leave the restaurant until a male accomplice entered the fast food chain.
The woman was arrested in November and charged with suspicion of assault at the Santa Ana Police Department Jail.
“There&apos;s no reason to physically assault someone because you didn&apos;t get enough ketchup,” Cpl. Anthony Bertagna Bertagna told KTLA-TV.

McGill University drops 'Redmen' name from sports teams,www.foxnews.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/mcgill-university-drops-redmen-name-from-sports-teams,"The Americas Published 13 hours ago McGill University drops 'Redmen' name from sports teams Associated Press Facebook Twitter Flipboard Print Email MONTREAL – McGill University has dropped the name Redmen from its varsity sports teams after receiving complaints that the name is a racial slur.
Principal Suzanne Fortier said in a statement Friday that the name had caused pain and alienation for indigenous students at the Canadian university. The change took effect immediately.
""Today, &apos;redmen&apos; is widely acknowledged as an offensive term for Indigenous peoples, as evidenced by major English dictionaries,"" Fortier said.
In recent years, American sports teams at amateur, college and professional levels have faced similar criticisms.
Last year, the Cleveland Indians baseball team removed Chief Wahoo as its logo. Stanford, Illinois and Dartmouth are also among the colleges and universities that have dropped Native American nicknames or symbols for their teams.
However, longstanding pressure to change the name of the Washington Redskins NFL team has so far been unsuccessful.
McGill&apos;s decision comes after an internal report revealed deep divisions between students and alumni over the nearly century-old name.
Even though the Redmen name was not initially adopted as a reference to indigenous people, the association was made in the 1950s when men&apos;s and women&apos;s teams came to be nicknamed the ""Indians"" and ""Squaws."" Some teams later adopted a logo with an indigenous man wearing a headdress.
The student who led the fight against the name told The Canadian Press he was ""ecstatic"" at the news.
""I had expected the name change,"" Tomas Jirousek said in an interview from Prague. ""I think if the principal had been actually listening to indigenous community members and students, I think it was the only possible option after, as she said in her email, &apos;the depth of pain&apos; we feel as indigenous students at the Redmen name.""
Meanwhile, a group of alumni who opposed the name change said they would never again donate to McGill and would discourage their children from applying to the school."

"House Democrats increase demands for Trump tax returns, setting up potential court fight",www.foxnews.com,Adam Shaw,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-democrats-increase-demands-for-trump-tax-returns-setting-up-potential-court-fight,"House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., told the IRS that the law gives Congress a right to the six years of Trump’s personal and business tax returns, and set a deadline for the agency to respond by April 23. Neal told IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig that if he does not respond to his letter, Neal will interpret that as denying the request, setting the stage for a potential court battle.
The Treasury Department missed an April 10 deadline last week set by Democrats to deliver the tax returns, and Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the department hadn’t decided whether to comply with the request.
“It is not the proper function of the IRS, Treasury, or Justice to question or second guess the motivations of the Committee or its reasonable determinations regarding its need for the requested tax returns or return information,” Neal wrote.
The letter marks the latest in a yearslong effort by Democrats to get access to Trump’s financial documents. Neal asked for Trump’s personal and business returns from 2013-18. Democrats say it is within their mandate of congressional oversight, but the unprecedented move has been opposed by Republicans.
Trump has said repeatedly throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and his presidency that he can’t make public his tax returns because he is under audit.
Video A lawyer for Trump said in a letter last week that the efforts are an attempt to harass a political opponent and that it would set a “dangerous precedent” for the agency to turn them over.
“For good reason, it would be a gross abuse of power for the majority to use tax returns as a weapon to attack, harass, and intimidate their political opponents. Once this Pandora’s box is opened, the ensuing tit-for-tat will do lasting damage to our nation,” William S. Consovoy said in a letter to the Treasury’s general counsel.
In his letter, Consovoy said that Neal “cannot legally request” the information as the tax code guards taxpayer privacy with the exception of certain conditions -- which he says are not met.
“Even if Ways and Means had a legitimate committee purpose for requesting the President’s tax returns and return information, that purpose is not driving Chairman Neal’s request,” he wrote.
“His request is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speech,” he added.

Forcing a smile at work linked to heavy drinking: study,www.foxnews.com,David Aaro,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/forcing-a-smile-at-work-linked-to-drinking-report,"Researchers at Penn State and the University of Buffalo studied the drinking habits of employees who work in the public view. Some of the jobs studied include nurses, teachers or food service employees. Alicia Grandey, professor of psychology at Penn State, believes these type of jobs should limit the need for employees to smile for the customer, according to the study.
""Faking and suppressing emotions with customers was related to drinking beyond the stress of the job or feeling negatively,"" said Grandey. ""It wasn&apos;t just feeling badly that makes them reach for a drink. Instead, the more they have to control negative emotions at work, the less they are able to control their alcohol intake after work.""
A study found a connection between people who fake emotion with heavier drinking after work. (iStock)
Researchers used data from a survey funded by the National Institutes of Health, called the National Survey of Work Stress and Health, which had included 3,000 participants in the U.S.
Researchers used phone interview data from 1,592 of those U.S. workers. Data collection was supported by a National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism grant.
The study looked at how often workers who faked or suppressed emotions and how often they drank after hours. It also measured variables like how impulsive the employees are or how much control they have at work.
Researchers found a stronger link between surface acting and drinking with highly impulsive people who work in jobs that don&apos;t develop a relationship with the customers they have to interact with (for example, employees at call centers). People at these types of jobs are usually young and entry-level professionals who don&apos;t have the social or financial benefits that can outweigh the costs of having to ""fake it"" all the time, according to the study.
""The relationship between surface acting and drinking after work was stronger for people who are impulsive or who lack personal control over behavior at work,"" said Grandey. ""If you&apos;re impulsive or constantly told how to do your job, it may be harder to rein in your emotions all day, and when you get home, you don&apos;t have that self-control to stop after one drink.""
Grandey said people who work in more rewarding jobs will be less likely to drink afterward.
""Nurses, for example, may amplify or fake their emotions for clear reasons,"" Grandey said. ""They&apos;re trying to comfort a patient or build a strong relationship. But someone who is faking emotions for a customer they may never see again, that may not be as rewarding, and may ultimately be more draining or demanding.""
She hopes this study will change how bosses treat their employees.
""Employers may want to consider allowing employees to have a little more autonomy at work, like they have some kind of choice on the job,"" Grandey said. ""And when the emotional effort is clearly linked to financial or relational rewards, the effects aren&apos;t so bad.""

A witness, Brian Johnson, told WCCO-TV on Friday that he heard a woman scream that her child had been thrown from the balcony. He said she was screaming, ""Everybody pray, everybody pray. Oh my God, my baby, someone threw him over the edge.""
Court records show that Aranda has a history of convictions for misdemeanor offense. He was charged in two previous incidents at the mall in 2015. Potts said some of those cases were handled through mental health court, but he didn&apos;t elaborate. At one point, Aranda had a trespass notice banning him from the mall, but it was no longer in effect, Potts said.
Jail records don&apos;t list an attorney for Aranda. Potts said he expects to submit the case to Hennepin County prosecutors for charges by noon on Monday.
The 4.2-million-square-foot Mall of America is in Bloomington, about 10 miles south of Minneapolis. It opened in 1992, has more than 520 stores and is visited by 40 million visitors annually, according to its website.

Lori Loughlin fears guilty plea's impact on daughters: report,www.foxnews.com,Jessica Napoli,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lori-loughlin-fears-guilty-pleas-impact-on-daughters-report,"One of the reasons the Hallmark actress is hesitating: Reports say she&apos;s concerned about the potential impact on her daughters . “She is very concerned about what a guilty plea would do to her daughters , who may not have grasped everything that was going on,” a source close to the star told People magazine .
“Yes, she can think about the public perception of her, but that’s nothing compared to what her daughters think of her. So that is something that has understandably made her less likely to enter a plea,"" the source added.
Loughlin and Giannulli allegedly paid $500,000 in bribes to get their young daughters into USC by falsely identifying them as crew recruits, even though they never participated in the sport.
Video The couple face the same charges, and their legal situation was made exponentially worse on Tuesday when they (along with 14 other parents) were indicted on additional charges of money laundering. The maximum prison sentence is 20 years for each charge.
“From the beginning, she didn’t want to take a deal, because she felt that she hadn’t done anything that any mom wouldn’t have done if they had the means to do so,” the source said. “So this wasn’t her being obstinate; this was her truly not understanding the seriousness of the allegations.”
The other celebrity parent involved in the college bribe scandal — Felicity Huffman — already pleaded guilty. “I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions,"" she said in a statement.
Meanwhile, the student statuses of Loughlin&apos;s two daughters at USC are up in the air. The university said the students involved in the alleged scheme will be under review.
""USC determined which applicants in the current admissions cycle are connected to the alleged scheme and they will be denied admission. A case-by-case review of current students who may be connected to the alleged scheme is also underway. We will make informed decisions about those cases as the reviews are completed,"" the college wrote on its website.

The condemned four-story buildings collapsed Friday in the hillside neighborhood of Itanhanga, an area that was hard hit by recent heavy rains and flash floods.

Booker’s remarks mark the start of a two-week tour across America for the 2020 hopeful, who has at times struggled to distinguish himself from the large pack of Democrats seeking the party’s nod and has languished in single digits in polls.
On Saturday, Booker led the rallying cry “We can’t wait” as he listed his policy goals, including fighting climate change, enacting comprehensive immigration reform ending “mass incarcerations” and facilitating federal legalization of marijuana.
He also made a call for national unity and for Democrats to fight “from higher ground” in an increasingly partisan and frequently toxic political environment.
Video ""Critics will tell us that a campaign powered by grace and love and a deep faith in each other"" cannot prevail, Booker said. ""But I say it&apos;s the only way we win. The president wants a race to the gutter and to fight us in the gutter. To win, we have to fight from higher ground in order to bring this country to higher ground.""
At the rally, he pushed his own bipartisan credentials -- namely the criminal justice reform bill he worked on, which was signed into law by President Trump last year. He is likely to continue to promote that work when he travels to states such as Iowa, Georgia and Nevada as part of his tour.
While Booker has thus far failed to generate the kind of buzz that has followed candidates such as Beto O’Rouke and Pete Buttigieg, his aides say that the campaign’s philosophy offers some home. That philosophy? “You’ve got to organize and get hot at the end.”
“We’re not building this campaign to win a poll in April of 2019. We’re trying to win the election in February of 2020, in March of 2020, in April of 2020. This is a long race where there’s going to be a lot of ups and downs,” Booker campaign manager Addisu Demissie told Fox News this week.
The campaign is directing most of its firepower to Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, the four states will kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar in February and can provide crucial momentum for the primaries to follow.
“We’ve built our operation with the intention of having the strongest operation in the states on the front end of the primary calendar,” he said.

Haitian orphanage founder arrested in Dominican Republic,www.foxnews.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/haitian-orphanage-founder-arrested-in-dominican-republic,"Email SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic – Police in the Dominican Republic have arrested a Haiti orphanage founder who's accused of molesting boys in his care. National police spokesman Col. Frank Felix Duran Mejia confirmed Saturday that Michael Geilenfeld was taken into custody. He did not say whether any charges had been filed and declined to specify whether Geilenfeld would be extradited to the U.S. or another country.
Seven men have accused Geilenfeld of sexually abusing them as boys.
Geilenfeld is a U.S. citizen who contends the assertions have ruined his reputation, cost the Hearts with Haiti charity several million dollars in donations and led him to be falsely imprisoned for 237 days.
An abuse survivors group said Friday that Geilenfeld had fled to the Dominican Republic to avoid arrest and prosecution in Haiti. Trending in World "
California man challenges federal law refusing 'immoral' trademark for clothing brand 'FUCT',www.foxnews.com,Paulina Dedaj,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-man-challenges-federal-law-refusing-immoral-trademark-for-clothing-brand-fuct,"Email
Los Angeles artist Erik Brunetti, the founder of the streetwear clothing company ""FUCT,"" poses for a photo in Los Angeles ON Thursday. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) A California man whose company carries a provocative name is hoping that the U.S. Supreme Court will rule against a trademark law that he says restricts his First Amendment rights. A lawyer for Erik Brunetti, owner of the “FUCT” clothing brand, will appear before the Supreme Court on Monday to challenge a federal trademarking law that allows officials to refuse trademarks that they deem “scandalous” or “immoral.”
Brunetti called the provision an unconstitutional restriction of speech that should be struck down. He also said that the underlying process is arbitrary, and that trademarks more offensive than his could be approved depending on who handles the case.
John R. Sommer, Brunetti’s lawyer, makes the argument that an attorney from the South might find something “not nice” that wouldn’t faze a lawyer from the Bronx.
That means “you can register profanity if you’re lucky” and you get assigned a lawyer who allows it, he continued.
OLIVIA JADE’S TRADEMARK APPLICATION WAS REJECTED FOR PUNCTUATION BEFORE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL
The Los Angeles-based clothing brand at issue, which started in 1991, can still operate under Brunetti’s chosen name without a trademark, but doing so could be costly. For instance, Brunetti wouldn't be able to go after counterfeiters who knock off his designs.
The government is defending the century-old trademarking provision, arguing in court documents that the law encourages trademarks that are appropriate for all audiences. The U.S. position is that the measure isn’t restricting speech, but rather declining to promote it.
But there have been workarounds in the past that could help Brunetti’s case.
Two years ago, the justices unanimously invalidated a related provision of federal law that told officials not to register disparaging trademarks. In that case, an Asian-American rock band sued after the government refused to register its band name, “The Slants,” because it was seen as offensive to Asians.

The office, which also refuses to trademark something too similar to existing ones, refused to register “FUK!T” for being scandalous and immoral -- but also confusingly similar to the already-registered “PHUKIT.”″MIDDLEFINGER” was denied after “JONNY MIDDLEFINGER” was registered, and “Ko Kane” was rejected after “Kokanee” was registered.
If Brunetti wins, the public is unlikely to notice a whole lot of change, his lawyer said. Retailers will decide what products are appropriate for their customers, and Target and Walmart aren’t going to carry Brunetti’s brand, Sommer said.

Rob Smith: I’m gay and support Mike Pence – don’t believe Pete Buttigieg’s claim that Pence is anti-gay,www.foxnews.com,Rob Smith,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rob-smith-im-gay-and-support-mike-pence-dont-believe-pete-buttigiegs-claim-that-pence-is-anti-gay,"Pete Buttigieg and Mike Pence spar over religion Vice president and second lady fire back at the the 2020 Democrat; Doug McKelway reports. I’m someone those on the left would have you believe doesn’t exist: a gay, black, conservative, Republican Christian. I’m glad that anti-gay bias doesn’t seem to be hurting South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg in his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, but I plan to vote to re-elect President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in November 2020. It’s an important sign of progress that Buttigieg’s sexual orientation, along with his marriage to another man, isn’t considered disqualifying in his bid for the presidency. It certainly would have been a few years ago. Thankfully, more and more Americans are realizing that sexual orientation is irrelevant unless you are looking for a romantic partner.
I know Buttigieg could make history by becoming the first openly gay major party presidential nominee – just as Hillary Clinton made history as the first female nominee and Barack Obama made history as the first black nominee and president.
MIKE PENCE HITS BACK AT PETE BUTTIGIEG AFTER CRITICISM: 'HE KNOWS BETTER'
But while I hope no one opposes Mayor Pete’s White House bid just because he is gay, I’m not ready to support him just because we share that one demographic characteristic.
And I think it’s unfortunate that Buttigieg has tried to portray Vice President Pence as anti-gay. Based on my own research, the work of the Log Cabin Republicans (an LGBT group) and my own experience recently meeting Pence, I know he is absolutely not anti-gay. That false accusation needs to be rejected once and for all.
But isn’t Pence an evangelical conservative Christian? Guilty as charged. So that means he must hate all gays and lesbians and wants to take away our rights, doesn’t it? Actually, no, it doesn’t. The left has branded Pence as the No. 1 enemy of gays and lesbians, so Buttigieg needs to show he can take Pence on, regardless of the cordial and respectful relationship they shared as Indiana politicians of different parties.
Campaigning at an event Sunday hosted by the LGBTQ Victory Fund, Buttigieg said: ""If me being gay was a choice, it was made far, far above my pay grade ... that’s the thing that I wish the Mike Pence’s of the world would understand – that if you got a problem with who I am – your problem is not with me, your quarrel sir, is with my creator.""
I love God and God loves me. I came to a deeper understanding of that particular fact after a tour in Iraq while I proudly served in the U.S. Army. Wartime service in combat helps you see the world in a completely different way.
Whether or not others interpret Christianity in the same way I do is none of my concern. Whether or not they believe I was born gay is also none of my concern until it starts to negatively impact my life. In 2019 it does not.
This message triggers those on the left because they’ve been very successful at convincing a generation of young gays and lesbians to reject God in favor of their cult of intersectionality and identity politics.
When religion is left behind, identity becomes religion. Politics becomes religion. And for many of these disaffected gay youth that I meet, far-left identity politics has become their religion. They worship its most prominent faces and voices like gods. Their Twitter feeds and Instagram posts become their Bible. And when their gods tell them that a politician is the enemy, they listen.
But here’s the truth: In the more than two years President Trump and Vice President Pence have been in office, gay and lesbian Americans have seen very little in terms of anti-gay legislation from this administration.
And according to many news reports, when Pence was governor of Indiana and Buttigieg was mayor of South Bend, the two got along well.
As The Associated Press reported Friday: “During the four years in which they overlapped in Indiana politics, Buttigieg, the South Bend mayor, had a cordial relationship with Pence. The two collaborated on economic development issues. Buttigieg presented Pence with a South Bend promotional T-shirt that said ‘I (heart) SB.’ And at ceremonial events, Pence would lavish Buttigieg with praise.”
For example, in June 2015, then-Gov. Pence called Buttigieg “a dedicated public servant and a patriot.” These aren’t the words of a homophobe, despite what many Democrats would like you to believe about Pence.
So why is Buttigieg woke-signaling now? Obviously, to get votes and campaign contributions from the gay community and others on the left.
The left has branded Pence as the No. 1 enemy of gays and lesbians, so Buttigieg needs to show he can take Pence on, regardless of the cordial and respectful relationship they shared as Indiana politicians of different parties.
A few weeks back, I was invited to the Midwest Regional Conference of Turning Point USA, an advocacy group for young conservatives. Pence spoke at the conference and I had the opportunity to take a photo with him and interact with his team as a part of my duties as a contributor to the organization. As a conservative, I was thrilled. As a gay man, I was unsure.
Why? Because I had heard and read many times that Pence supported so-called “conversion therapy”– the absurd and discredited “treatment” to make gay people straight, as if we were afflicted with a mental illness and needed to be cured. The very concept of “conversion therapy” is demeaning and insulting.
So I decided to get to the root of where this all came from, and was furious when I learned that it was based on a lie and a smear. I stumbled onto a Fox News op-ed written by former Log Cabin Republican Executive Director Gregory Angelo that delved into the origins of the smear.
Angelo found that Pence never advocated trying to change anyone’s sexual orientation. Instead, the governor supported reauthorizing funding to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS only if resources were “directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.”
Angelo, who is gay, wrote: “Changing one’s ‘sexual behavior’ is far different than changing one’s ‘sexual orientation.’ In fact, at the time of Pence’s proclamation, LGBT advocates were working to promote safer sexual behaviors themselves with condom distribution programs and public education campaigns about HIV transmission.”
That’s it. A stance that then-Gov. Pence had taken involving the reauthorization of HIV/AIDS funding was twisted by the left, repeated again and again, and used to exploit the deepest fears of gays and lesbians to get them to support Democrats and oppose Republican Pence.
I searched more and more for any other information that supported the claim that Pence supported “conversion therapy” but I couldn’t find anything. I was furious, realizing I and many others had been lied to by the left yet again.
So I went to the Turning Point USA conference. I posed for a photo with Pence and smiled bright and wide. I was proud to be there.
The vice president was welcoming and cordial to this gay, black, Iraq war combat veteran and conservative Republican. Like he was to our gay ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell when swearing him in as Grenell’s longtime partner Matt Lashey held the Bible.
Gays and lesbians are here to stay. Yes, even in the GOP. The vice president respects that. And I, as a gay conservative, can respect his right to his traditional Christian beliefs – even if they aren’t mine.

I support the Trump-Pence team because I think these two men are doing a great job for America and can do more if given another four years in office.
I realize many Americans are opposed to President Trump and Vice President Pence for a variety of reasons. But if this opposition is based on a belief that the occupants of our nation’s highest offices are anti-gay, it is based on a lie of the left.
