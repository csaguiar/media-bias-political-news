Pathetic.
Measles was all but eliminated before the vaccine was introduced. That is an undeniable fact.
Mortality from measles is very low. Getting it gives lifelong immunity and strengthens the immune system.
Fact: only a handful of people have died from measles the last 20 years yet hundreds have died from the vaccine.
The CDC only pushes the vaccine because they probably own the patent. They own over 20 vaccine patents. They are a vaccine profit company.
There is ZERO scientific evidence vaccines are safe and effective."
