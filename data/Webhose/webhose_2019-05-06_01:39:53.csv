“Lady J”: What’s In a Name,thepolitic.org,Claire Kalikman,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://thepolitic.org/lady-j-whats-in-a-name/,"Claire Kalikman April 7, 2019
The year is 1750. Madame de la Pommeraye (played by Cécile de France) is a wealthy widow who lives on a large estate and falls for the libertine Marquis des Arcis. But the rakish Marquis soon tires of her and their romantic relationship eases into a friendship. Although Madame DLP pretends that it was her idea to end it, she is bitter and seeks to enact her revenge. She recruits two ladies expelled from high society who have been forced into prostitution, Madame and Mademoiselle de Joncquières. Shakesperean-type drama ensues.
They say revenge is a dish best served cold. Here, it is best served with over the top hairstyles, bourgeois decor, and pastel period dresses. The movie left me with the impression that the writer and director Emmanuel Mouret simply wanted to make a period piece with the beautiful Cécile and the plot was more or less irrelevant… and that was perfectly fine with me.
The film is loosely adapted from a novel by Denis Diderot called Jacques the Fatalist . It also appears to draw inspiration from Pierre de Laclos’s 18th century novel “Dangerous Liaisons” with its plotting of various sexual relationships to enact revenge. The movie also connoted the Kate Beckinsale-led movie “Love and Friendship,” which itself was adapted from Jane Austen’s novel Lady Susan . In one sense the Beckinsale movie was not very good, but in another, more important way, all these films and books exist in the same exciting world: a vengeful female lead in beautiful costume-filled 18th century Europe.
Cécile de France plays the Madame with an excellent saccharine edge. In conversations with the Marquis, whose downfall she is plotting, her face appears blank, with an insipid smile on her face. But when talking with her best friend she is downcast, every muscle in her face on edge. Cécile de France (yes, that’s her real name, although ironically she’s Belgian) is a beloved actress in France, and won her first César for her appearance in the excellent film “Auberge Espagnole.” She was also a guest star on the French series “Call My Agent”, also available on Netflix, where she plays a hilariously conniving actress.
The title of the movie follows the custom of 18th and 19th century literature to name the work after the lead female (think Emma or Daisy Miller ). In English the film is titled “Lady J”, but I laughed when I realized that in French it is called “Mademoiselle de Joncquières” – I wonder if Netflix executives decided to change it because they thought a non-French speaking audience would never make the effort to pronounce the name. More fascinatingly, the title of the book on which the movie is based is named after the lead male character, but the writers made a small but powerful change by shifting the focus to the lead female and renaming the movie after her. The plot of the original book is a series of vignettes detailing various romantic foibles and mishaps: the story of Madame DLP is one of these stories. It’s therefore all the more interesting that a story first told from the point of view of a man has evolved over the last few centuries into this movie, so completely based in a woman’s point of view.
The mademoiselle in question is very beautiful. She barely looks at the camera or speaks, which seems to be part of what attracts the Marquis to her. He likes that she is unattainable, because he is more interested in the “chase” than the reward. But at the end, the young lady runs after him with a clomping stride and shouts at him. This show of emotion and strength is made all the more shocking by how strongly it contrasts with her demure personality up until this point. That is part of what drives this movie: women who at first glance seem gentle and dim, but who underneath betray strong feelings of vengeance and despair.
The best friend of Madame DLP is mostly thrust to the side, even though she is the only person loyal to her. I was haunted by the last line she utters – “he’s as alone as you are.” Except the marquis is not alone – he is with the wife he has decided to accept. Madame DLP has her best friend, who has always been honest with her and on her side, but whom she does not appreciate. They are in opposite situations.
At the end the Marquis decides to embrace his wife and forgive the lies and transgressions that brought the two together. We see their victorious union in contrast to the Madame, who feels empty even though her plot has reached its climax. By displaying this ending, the focus of the film shifts from Madame DLP to Mademoiselle J, the titular character. This is significant because most of the movie has been about DLP’s plotting, but in the end, it’s the soft-spoken Mademoiselle J who triumphs even through DLP’s manipulations. It is surprising to see a period film with several such strong and complex women. Most often these movies, such as “Pride and Prejudice” are more about the dictates of society and how women conform to them, and less about the inner thoughts of women.
My friend complained that the movie was “too slow, as all French movies.” It’s true that there is not a lot of action, and the plot is largely based in small psychological manoeuvres.
The movie is downright Proustian: it portrays a male lead who quickly bores of his conquests and only wants what he cannot have, namely, Mademoiselle J. This ennui (the French term for a deep existential angst and boredom) is what propels the movie forward. But it is also a question that goes unanswered: can we ever be satisfied? The Marquis appears happy at the end of the movie, choosing to stay with his wife, whose affection he has finally won over. But the whole problem with the Marquis, from Madame DLP’s perspective was that as soon as he prevailed upon a woman, he tired of her – but there is no explanation offered for why Mademoiselle J is any different.

ISLAMABAD, Apr 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) : All Parties Hurriyat Conference Chairman Syed Ali Gilani has strongly condemned the economic crackdown on local media , particularly some newspapers, by the Indian authorities in the territory.
According to Kashmir Media Service (KMS) , Syed Ali Gilani in a statement issued in Srinagar said throttling and curbing the media houses was part of the vast game plan and those thumping the chest to uphold the fourth pillar of democracy were themselves the architects of the undemocratic assault on media .
""Like every institution, media people in the Indian occupied Kashmir (IOK) too have a strenuous and suffocating environment to carry out their professional duties and they too have been facing a double edged sword from the last so many decades. ""Tehreek-e-Hurriyat Jammu and Kashmir Chairman, Mohammad Ashraf Sehrai demanded of the UN Secretary General Ant�nio Guterres to take a step forward and appoint a special representative on Kashmir to explore a viable solution to the lingering dispute. He urged the international community to come to the rescue of the humanity, which is getting killed in the occupied territory, every now and then.
The Hurriyat forum led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq at its executive committee meeting in Srinagar also strongly condemned the sending of the third summons to Mirwaiz Umar Farooq by the National Investigation Agency."

Jayapal: ‘We’re Going to Push Hard’ to Find Out What Trump Is ‘Hiding’ in the Mueller Report PAM KEY 7 Apr 2019 Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) pledged Democratic lawmakers would “push hard” to get special counsel Robert Mueller’s full report.
Jayapal said, “I think there’s a real problem with a politically appointed attorney general who seems to have released a three-page report on the actual Mueller report. The only thing we have seen so far that now is seeming to not comport with what Mueller and his team actually prepared. So, we are very firm.”
She continued, “I think the main thing here is what is the president hiding? How do we make sure that we get everything that was produced? We have not seen a Mueller report. We have only seen a Barr report. We’re going to stay firm on this. We’re going to push hard. We think there’s lots of precedent for us in the past to be able to do this. That’s really, I think, the main thing is that the majority of the American people want to see the report. We have to do our job.”
She added, “We don’t know what was in the Mueller report, what was in it around conspiracy. We know what the president says was in it. We certainly don’t know what the underlying information was that Special Counsel Mueller felt he could not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice. That’s a critically serious charge.”

DUBAI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 07th Apr, 2019) Dubai is all geared up for the opening of two landmark events that will convene top government leaders, investors, and industry experts from across the globe for three days to separately discuss the important role of startups and cities of the future in a nation’s sustainable socio-economic development and growth.
AIM Startup and Future Cities Show, both initiatives of the UAE Ministry of Economy, are happening in conjunction with the Annual Investment Meeting (AIM) 2019 , the world ’s leading platform for foreign direct investment (FDI), from 8th to 10th of April . Both shows, will feature conferences and exhibitions.
The latest edition of AIM Startup will bring over 150 promising startup companies under one roof to help facilitate business interactions and investment partnerships with major investors, business leaders, representatives of international institutions, and government entities.
Additionally, the participating small businesses with immense growth potential will be given an opportunity to demonstrate their ground-breaking solutions to a diverse global audience, providing them with a platform for maximum exposure to new markets and enabling them to widen their reach.
Walid Farghal, Project Manager for AIM Startup and Future Cities Show, said: ""Under the theme ‘Harnessing Global Digitisation to Empower Startups and SMEs’, this year’s AIM Startup will examine the effects of next-generation technologies by exploring the benefits, challenges, and opportunities brought about by digitalisation.""
""Intensive digital transformation efforts are taking place in Dubai and the UAE and startups, which are vital to the country’s adoption of knowledge- and innovation-driven economy, play a role in the success of these initiatives. As it is crucial that we contribute to the segment’s growth, we are in effect empowering startups by providing them with a venue where they can easily engage in collaborative efforts with potential investors and partners from across the world . ""
The event will hold panel discussions focusing on understanding the investment game; investing in the digital age; the future of entrepreneurship; the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain; the legal, financial, and social considerations when expanding abroad, and many more.
The Future Cities Show, on the other hand, will focus on five leading future city solutions, namely AI, blockchain, smart infrastructure, smart mobility, and sustainability.
According to Walid Farghal, the event is the only show that unites leaders from various industries to interact, discuss, and showcase top-notch solutions for a smart sustainable future.
Under the theme 'Propelling Globalisation through Digital Transformation’, the third edition will convene experts, leaders, and stakeholders who will take part in conferences and workshops tackling a range of topics, from the future of trust, green urban mobility and smart infrastructure to self-sustaining cities.
Walid Farghal said: ""For the Future Cities Show, participants will have an opportunity to exchange ideas with their like-minded peers and form investment partnerships that will help address social, economic, and environmental challenges. We will also highlight Dubai ’s achievements and plans such as Dubai 10X Initiatives, which aim to create new business models through the adoption of disruptive technologies. By doing so, we are underscoring the emirate’s leadership in implementing digital innovations in the region. Now is the time to emphasise the significance of the cities of the future, especially in the midst of increased globalization and connectivity.""
The Future Cities Show will also provide a global exhibition platform for 10 participating countries as well as networking opportunities to hold B2B and B2G meetings. Participants will be given a rare chance to promote their projects and services and connect with governments and private organisations at the global level."

ISLAMABAD, Apr 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Like other parts of the globe, the World Health Day was also observed in Pakistan on Sunday to remind that everyone should be able to access the health care they need, when and where they need it.
Various advocacy events were held around the world and in various cities of Pakistan to fuel the momentum of the 'Health for All movement' and to highlight World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of achieving a fairer, healthier world � in which no one is left behind.
The focus was on equity and solidarity � on raising the bar for health for everyone, everywhere by addressing gaps in services, and leaving no one behind. The tagline for World Health Day is 'Health for all � everyone, everywhere'.
According to WHO, universal health coverage means that all people have access to the quality health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship.
""We believe this is possible and it starts with strong Primary health care as it is a whole-of-society approach to health and well-being centred on the needs and preferences of individuals, families and communities."" It added to make health for all a reality, governments need to invest in quality, accessible primary health care. It added health workers need to care and advocate for patients and educate them on how to get and stay healthy while individuals and communities need to be empowered to take care of their own health.
It said that the goals to observe the day are to improve understanding of universal health coverage and the importance of primary health care as its foundation, to spur action from individuals, policy-makers and health-care workers and to make universal health care a reality for everyone.
It said that at least half of the people in the world do not receive the health services they need and about 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty each year because of out-of-pocket spending on health. It added over 800 million people which is almost 12% of the world 's population spent at least 10% of their household budgets to pay for health care.
It said that all UN Member States have agreed to try to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030, as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. It said that health is a human right and everyone should have the information and services they need to take care of their own health and the health of their families.
WHO said that primary health care is a cost effective and equitable way of delivering health services and helping countries make progress towards universal health coverage. It added health workers have a crucial role to play educating patients on how to take care of their health, coordinating care and advocating for their patients' needs to health facility managers and policy-makers."
Turkey: Erdogan Pledges to Convert Byzantine Cathedral Hagia Sophia into a Mosque,www.gatestoneinstitute.org,Uzay Bulut,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/14018/turkey-erdogan-hagia-sophia-mosque,"https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/14018/turkey-erdogan-hagia-sophia-mosque
""When Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, virtually all of the city's surviving cathedrals and churches were — after being desecrated and thoroughly plundered — forcibly seized and turned over to the Turks' religious establishment to be converted to mosques and used as Muslim properties."" — Dr. Alexandros K. Kyrou, professor of history, Salem State University .
Nine other former Hagia Sophia churches are either being used as mosques already or are in the process of being renovated for this purpose. The youngest of these, in Trabzon, was converted into a mosque in 2013. — Ersoy Soydan, assistant professor of communications at Kastamonu University and author of Churches and Monasteries in Turkey
Sadly, Turkey's Greek community as a whole, let alone that of Istanbul by itself, is not sizeable enough to oppose or protest infringements on their historic cathedral. The 1914-1923 genocide of Greek Christians in Anatolia, and subsequent atrocities against the survivors -- such as the 1955 anti-Greek pogroms in Istanbul -- have almost completely wiped out the region's Greek populace. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently announced plans to convert the Hagia Sophia museum, originally a Byzantine cathedral, into a mosque. (Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images)
Addressing a rally ahead of the March 31 municipal elections in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced plans to convert the Hagia Sophia museum , originally a Byzantine cathedral, into a mosque.
Erdogan repeated this statement the following day during a televised interview. ""Hagia Sophia will no longer be called a museum,"" he declared . ""Its status will change. We will call it a mosque.""
Erdogan took the opportunity to respond to foreign officials critical of his intention to violate the former church by venting against Israel.
""Those who remain silent when Al Aqsa mosque is attacked, trampled [and] its windows smashed cannot tell us what to do about the status of Hagia Sophia,"" he said, referring to clashes between Palestinian-Arab rioters and Israeli police on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, the holiest site in Judaism and the location of the Al Aqsa mosque.
Hagia Sophia, however, has nothing to do with either Al Aqsa or Israel. Destroying churches to use as mosques is also not new to Turkey, both during and preceding Erdogan's rule. Islamic supremacists have, in fact, been engaging in this practice since the Turkish invasion and takeover of Asia Minor in the 11th century.
Hagia Sophia (Greek for ""Holy Wisdom"") was built in the 6th century in Constantinople -- today's Istanbul -- and remained the world's largest cathedral for nearly 1,000 years, until the Ottoman Turks conquered the city and looted it.
Dr. Alexandros K. Kyrou, professor of history at Salem State University, recounts :
""When Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, virtually all of the city's surviving cathedrals and churches were — after being desecrated and thoroughly plundered — forcibly seized and turned over to the Turks' religious establishment to be converted to mosques and used as Muslim properties. The conquering sultan, Mehmet II, personally oversaw the conversion of Hagia Sophia. Crosses were demolished and exchanged for crescents, altars and bells were destroyed, icons were burned or hacked to pieces, mosaics and frescoes depicting Christian imagery were plastered over, and most of the cathedral's priests were killed or enslaved. In time, four colossal minarets were erected to surround Hagia Sophia, producing the iconic image that has come to be globally associated with Ottoman Constantinople and Turkish Istanbul...
""Indeed, the purpose for the construction of the massive minarets that now tower over Hagia Sophia was to project to the world Islam's triumph over Christendom's greatest empire, city, and church. The capture of Hagia Sophia confirmed and symbolized in the Ottomans' imagination their belief in the superiority of their state and faith over all other nations and all religions, a putative affirmation of their providential role and destiny in history. Hence, the Ottomans formally dedicated their greatest, most celebrated single piece of loot — Hagia Sophia — as Great Fatih Mosque, or 'Great Conquest Mosque.'""
The Turkish Republic, established in 1923, changed the name of Constantinople to Istanbul in 1930, and, under the first president Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, turned the city's Hagia Sophia mosque into a museum in 1935 -- but not back to a church. For at least the last six years, however, Turkish officials have been talking about their desire to reconvert it into a mosque.
In 2013, Turkey's then-deputy prime minister, Bülent Arınç, told reporters that he hoped to see Istanbul's Hagia Sophia Museum used as a mosque. In 2016, Turkish authorities announced that readings from the Koran would be broadcast from Hagia Sophia during Islam's holy month of Ramadan, spurring the government to appoint a permanent imam who would lead five daily Islamic prayers at the site.
The Hagia Sophia in Istanbul is not the first former Hagia Sophia church (and later museum) to be converted into a mosque in Turkey. According to Ersoy Soydan, assistant professor of communications at Kastamonu University and author of Churches and Monasteries in Turkey , nine other former Hagia Sophia churches are either being used as mosques already or are in the process of being renovated for this purpose. The youngest of these, in Trabzon, was converted into a mosque in 2013.
Sadly, Turkey's Greek community as a whole, let alone that of Istanbul by itself, is not sizeable enough to oppose or protest infringements on their historic cathedral. The 1914-1923 genocide of Greek Christians in Anatolia, and subsequent atrocities against the survivors -- such as the 1955 anti-Greek pogroms in Istanbul -- have almost completely wiped out the region's Greek populace.

----Ken Shultz
""I suspect you were in favor of securing the border regardless of whether there were any rapists in the caravan, weren't you? If that's your position, then why not start from that point?""
----Ken Shultz
Example 1:
""There are plenty of rapists and child molesters among the caravans. Trump was right in this regard.""
----JesseAz
Why does this matter?
Example 2:
""I expected more of you Ken.""
----JesseAz
You expected me to defend claims that don't matter either way because Trump made them--or you expected me to believe Trump's claims about rapists and Al Qaeda in the caravan because I support border security?
Not sorry to have disappointed you.
Example 3:
""Other than to claim Trump said something he didn't?""
----JesseAz
So, now, not only were Trump's statements true--but he didn't actually make them?!
And all of this over a question that should have no bearing on whether we want to build a wall or support border security. Out of curiosity, what do you hope to accomplish by defending Trump's silly statements?
. . . and he's made a lot of them!"

Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday, “Keep in mind they knew they’re not going to get these taxes. They know what the law is. They know that one of the fundamental principles of the IRS is to protect the confidentiality of you, and me, and everybody else who files taxes. They know that. They know the terms by which under law that the IRS can give them the documents, but political hit job is not one of those reasons, so they know they’re not getting it.”

— PoliticusUSA (@politicususa) April 7, 2019 The law says the IRS will have to turn over Trump’s tax returns
Trump himself has been under the delusion that he gets to decide if he turns over his tax returns. Mulvaney was engaging in political spin for the Fox News audience by avoiding the reason why Democrats are asking for the tax returns. Under the law, the IRS has to turn over the tax returns because Democrats are investigating whether or not the IRS is following correct auditing procedures with Trump.
The law is clear. The IRS must hand over Trump’s returns. This isn’t a request. It is a legal obligation.
Mulvaney’s answer suggested Trump is going to try to fight this is in court, but he will lose because Democrats aren’t engaging in a “political hit job.” They are conducting oversight.
Mick Mulvaney did get one thing right. This issue was decided by the voters when they gave Democrats control of the House. The voters want the tax returns, and House Democrats are going to get them."

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 07th April, 2019) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged ahead of the upcoming parliamentary elections in the country that he will never allow the creation of the Palestinian state in the way that the international community views it.
""There will be no Palestinian state, not as people talk about it. It will not be because I am making sure of it ... I am maintaining a united Jerusalem and I am maintaining our control on the entire area west of the Jordan River to prevent another Gaza . This is my policy,"" the prime minister said in an interview with the Arutz Sheva news portal, published on Sunday .
The parliamentary elections are slated to take place in Israel on April 9, with Netanyahu seeking re-election as the head of the country's government .
Palestine remains only partially recognized as a state and claims the territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank , including East Jerusalem . In 1947, the United Nations worked out a plan to put an end to the conflict, giving most of the West Bank and Gaza to Palestine .
Israel occupied the territories 20 years later but claims to have withdrawn all its forces from Gaza in 2005. The United Nations supports the recognition of Palestine within its pre-1967 borders."

President Trump hosted a gathering to celebrate the First Step Act, the prison reform legislation recently passed that begins to address sentencing and other issues for people incarcerated in the federal prison system.
It was my great privilege to be in the room with the President, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump who were the driving forces behind the initiative, and numerous members of the House, Senate, and activist groups who all played a key role in taking this “first step.”
The most important people in the room, however, were not the politicians who voted, they were the people who have been released from prison as a direct result of the First Step Act.
This event was not covered by the MSM because of how well it reflected upon the President and because of the praise he received from the people whose lives he has helped change forever. During the event, he introduced the guests of honor and had some of them step up to the microphone.

Gregory Allen made me laugh out loud when he enthusiastically shared with the crowd that two months ago, he was in a jail cell and now he is in the White House. He used that dichotomy to suggest “Let’s continue to make America great again.”
April Johnson made tears well in my eyes when she stepped up and shared with everyone how last September her daughter received a diagnosis of ovarian cancer with a very pessimistic prognosis. Because of the First Step Act, she was now going to be able to spend the time her daughter has left at her side instead of in her memories.
Several of the guests referred to the people they had left behind in prison and how there is still more work to be done. They mentioned the need for a “Second Step Act,” as did the President. It is forthcoming and it will address reentry into societyand reducing the unemployment rate for people with prison records. The President noted that their unemployment rate is roughly five times higher than the same measure for the general population.
Odd. We will gladly employ people who are here illegally but are less willing to employ someone who did something illegal and has paid the price for it.
President Trump can act in this area because while he ran as a Republican, he is not in any sense of the word a “traditional” Republican. The Republican Party has positioned itself as the party of “law and order.” Somehow, this has been lazily equated with not caring for lawbreakers. It is as if because a person has broken a law, they then become less than fully human. It is an extension of the idea that if you want to support our police, a common position for conservatives to take, then you can’t support anyone who has run afoul of the police.
This is broken logic and the President is the first Republican to bend down to pick up the pieces.
In his remarks, President Trump referenced human “dignity and potential” (Charlie Kirk/Breitbart News)
In fact, he is the first President to address this, period.
If people want to point to divided government as an excuse for things not getting done, I direct you to the first two years of the Obama administration where they had control of both the House and Senate. This wasn’t on their agenda. During that period, the only aspect of the criminal justice system on President Obama’s mind was pardoning himself for stealing away our choices for our own doctors andhealth insurance plans.
The First Step Act happened because President Trump and his much-maligned daughter Ivanka, and her even more maligned husband Jared, were willing to take that first step into an arena that other conservatives, and liberals, have not dared to enter. They were willing to do this because they are not beholden to party politics and special interest constituencies. Take a deep breath and enjoy the politically clean air.
In his remarks the President mentioned damage done by what he called the “Clinton Crime Act,” properly known as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. This Act, which had Senator Joe Biden as a major proponent, was Draconian in nature and helped to firmly stamp the word “hopelessness” across the forehead of anyone convicted of a felony within the federal system. First Step, and now Second Step, are this President’s way of working around VCCLE without having to repeal it.
To try and put all of this into perspective, President Donald Trump, along with Jared, Ivanka, and others, have recognized that in America we have systematically and thoroughly dehumanized people who have committed crimes and been run through the criminal justice system. They further have recognized that we have created a culture that implicitly says, “you may have served your time, but we are not done punishing you yet.”
The President who is not beholden has showed a willingness to say enough!
In his remarks, the President made references to human “dignity and potential,” moving toward “a nation that believes in redemption,” and giving a people a chance to “contribute to their community, state, and nation.” He also said that we are “one united nation sharing one common destiny.”
That statement might seem preposterous to anyone who observes how divided our nation is today in terms of political conflict. The truth is, we are united whether wewant to be or not. We are in this together; joyously, reluctantly, or otherwise. We are all to be measured in part by how we treat the least and the troubled among us.
I, for one, stand joyously in unity with the President, Ivanka, and Jared in supporting what’s been done in Step One and what is to come in Step Two.

DEAD SEA (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 07th April, 2019) Afghan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah called on Russia and the United States to better coordinate on Afghanistan with other regional and global actors, in a comment to Sputnik on Sunday .
""Recently, there was a meeting between the Russian presidential special envoy and the US special envoy. They are coordinating. The better they can coordinate with the region and the world powers the better impact it will have,"" he said during a World Economic Forum at the Dead Sea, Jordan .
The chief executive stressed that US and Russian efforts ""should lead to a situation where Afghans themselves sit together and decide about the future of the country.""
He acknowledged that the United States was in talks with the Doha-based Taliban to address its own concerns about the Taliban 's links to al-Qaeda (banned in Russia ) and other terrorist groups.
""This is a big concern for the Americans. They are talking directly to the Taliban about that. But when it comes to the future of the country, a ceasefire is needed,"" he said, repeating that the Afghans should agree it among themselves.
The US special envoy for Afghan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, has held several rounds of meetings with the Taliban with the stated goal of drawing up a road map for ending the years-long conflict in Afghanistan . The United States wants guarantees from Islamist insurgents that they would not harbor international terrorists in exchange for US troop pullout."
