Ivanka Trump says she passed on opportunity to lead World Bank | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ivanka-trump-says-she-passed-opportunity-lead-the-world-bank,"By Steve Benen Donald Trump recently conceded that he considered one of his adult daughters, White House aide Ivanka Trump, to lead the World Bank. In fact, the president told The Atlantic that he also saw her as a possible ambassador to the United Nations, but also thought she’d be a good fit at the World Bank because, as he put it, “she’s very good with numbers.”
It now appears the president did more than just contemplate this possibility.
White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump says her father asked her if she was interested in taking the job of World Bank chief but she passed on it.
In an Associated Press interview, President Donald Trump’s daughter said Wednesday she was happy with her current role in the administration. She spoke during a trip to Africa to promote a global women’s initiative.
Ivanka Trump says her father raised the job with her as “a question” and she told him she was “happy with the work” she’s doing…. Asked if her father had approached her about other top jobs, Ivanka Trump said she’d “keep that between” them.
There’s still some question as to the exact nature of the discussion. There’s a qualitative difference between a president asking, “Is this a position you might be interested in?” and a president saying, “I’m offering you this job.”
But in either case, we’re looking at a very strange dynamic.
As we discussed last week, it was shortly after the 2016 elections when Ivanka Trump said she would not take on a role in her father’s administration.
As regular readers know , it was a commitment she quickly abandoned. Ivanka Trump soon had a West Wing office , a staff , a policy portfolio , and a presence on the international stage .
We now also know, because her father admitted it on the record, that the president also had a conversation with her about possibly leading the World Bank – despite having none of the necessary qualifications or background – but she passed on the opportunity.
Imagine for a moment what Republicans would be saying if 80,000 votes in the Rust Belt went the other way and President Hillary Clinton were offering all of these opportunities to Chelsea Clinton.

Mueller report details Trump's efforts to undermine Russia scandal probe | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/mueller-report-details-trumps-efforts-undermine-russia-scandal-probe,"By Steve Benen As you’ve probably heard, the Justice Department released a redacted version of report late this morning, and while it’s impossible to summarize a 448-page document in two sentences, this Associated Press report struck me as quite compelling.
Public at last, special counsel Robert Mueller’s report revealed to a waiting nation Thursday that President Donald Trump tried to seize control of the Russia probe and force Mueller’s removal to stop him from investigating potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Mueller laid out multiple episodes in which Trump directed people around him to try to influence or curtail the Russia investigation after the special counsel’s appointment in May 2017.
Broadly speaking, we’re dealing that explored three central questions: did Russia attack American elections, did our adversaries have partners in Donald Trump’s political operation, and did Trump obstruct the investigation into what transpired.
The first question appears to have been answered in definitive fashion. Literally, the second sentence of the Mueller report says, “The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.” It’s a detail the Republican president has never acknowledged, at least not publicly, and it’s an assessment that skeptics of the Russia scandal have long resisted, but by fair measure, the debate over this has run its course.
On a related note, the Mueller report went on to note that the investigation “established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome.” That, too, is a fairly obvious detail that both the president and other skeptics of the scandal have long resisted.
On the second question, related to possible cooperation between the Russian attackers and the campaign they were determined to help, the Mueller report also noted Trump’s political operation “expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.”
What’s more, the Republican campaign “showed interest in WikiLeaks’ releases of documents and welcomed their potential to damage” Hillary Clinton.
And while there’s no shortage of redactions in relevant parts of the Mueller report, it leaves little doubt that there were extensive connections between Russians and Trump insiders, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s briefings with Konstantin Kilimnik, whom “the FBI assesses to have ties to Russian intelligence.”
The report added that while the connections between Moscow and Trump’s campaign didn’t rise to the level of criminal misconduct, the investigation did identify “numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign.”
But perhaps the most striking aspect of the report, at least for me, are the elements referred to in the aforementioned Associated Press excerpt. For all of Attorney General Bill Barr’s talk this morning about White House “cooperation’ with the investigation, there can be little doubt that Trump personally and directly took repeated ongoing – and not just by refusing to sit down for an interview.
It’s obviously a tough thing to summarize in a blog post – I’m going to hope you’ll watch tonight’s show – but the case for obstruction is remarkably strong.
“[T]he investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the Trump Campaign lied to the Office, and to Congress, about their interactions with Russian-affiliated individuals and related matters,” the Mueller report noted. “Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian election interference.”
The president personally made “non-public efforts to control” the special counsel probe,” the report added, and engaged in efforts “in both investigation.”
It went to say, “[I]f we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.” They made no such statement, Trump’s hysteria about “no obstruction” notwithstanding.
In fact, reading the document, it seemed at times that the president would face even more serious legal jeopardy if only members of his team did more to follow his instructions: “The president’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.”
Those requests included Trump’s efforts to, among other things, fire Mueller before the investigation’s end.
These two paragraphs are personal favorites, highlighting a conversation between the president and then-White House Counsel Don McGahn.
The President also asked McGahn in the meeting why he had told Special Counsel’s Office investigators that the President had told him to have the Special Counsel removed. McGahn responded that he had to and that his conversations with the President were not protected by attorney-client privilege. The President then asked, “What-about these notes? Why do you take notes? Lawyers don ‘t take note s. I never had a lawyer who took notes .”
McGahn responded that he keeps notes because he is a “real lawyer ” and explained that notes create a record and are not a bad thing. The President said, “I’ve had a lot of great lawyers, like Roy Cohn. He did not take notes.”
On more than one occasion, the Mueller report added that the investigators’ findings would’ve been more complete, were it not for all of the lying and deletions of relevant messages.
It’s probably safe to say I could get a couple hundred blog posts out of the Mueller report, but for now, I’ll just say this: if Donald Trump thinks this document is good news, he’s fooled himself into believing complete nonsense.

* The opposition : “Congressional Democrats on Thursday highlighted portions of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 campaign that appeared to contradict President Donald Trump’s assertion that it represents ‘total exoneration,’ pointing to examples within the document that they said demonstrate that the president had obstructed justice.”
* We don’t yet know if Mueller will accept the invitation : “House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., called on special counsel Robert Mueller to testify before his committee ‘no later than May 23.’”

* NAFTA 2.0 : “President Trump’s new North American trade deal will have an almost imperceptible effect on the U.S. economy, boosting the $20 trillion economy by just 0.35 percent and giving an even smaller jolt to the labor market, according to an independent expert analysis by the International Trade Commission.”
* Christopher Steele : “The frenzied anticipation around special counsel Robert Mueller’s full report has overshadowed another Justice Department report on the Russia probe that could land as soon as next month, and which will likely take direct aim at the former British spy behind an infamous ‘dossier’ on President Donald Trump’s ties to Russia.”

Why Trump's written answers to Mueller was deemed 'inadequate' | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-19-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-trumps-written-answers-mueller-was-deemed-inadequate,"By Steve Benen For reasons that aren’t yet clear, Attorney General Bill Barr assured the public yesterday morning that Donald Trump’s White House “fully cooperated” with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. We soon after learned that the opposite is true, though even at the time, the claim didn’t make a lot of sense.
If the president was willing to “fully” cooperate, wouldn’t he have agreed to answer investigators’ questions?
We learned in the Mueller report that investigators considered a subpoena to compel Trump to answer questions, but they ultimately passed, concluding that the legal fight would create excessive delays in the probe. The special counsel’s office instead agreed to a written Q&A with the president.
As the Washington Post noted , it didn’t go especially well.
They covered four primary topic areas: the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016, the Russian effort to interfere with the election, the proposed development project in Moscow and contacts with Russia or Russia-related issues during the campaign and transition. In total, the Mueller team asked 38 distinct questions with 37 follow-ups.
Trump offered 22 distinct answers. In 19 of those answers, he claims not to remember or recall some particular issue. Often, those failures to remember what happened constitute the entirety of his response.
Questions related to obstruction of justice weren’t answered at all.
The Mueller report noted, in reference to Trump’s responses, “We viewed the written answers to be inadequate.” Imagine that.
But to appreciate what makes this even more amazing, it’s worth revisiting how proud the president was in his answers.
Circling back to our earlier coverage , Trump originally claimed he was eager to sit down with investigators to answer their questions. When the president’s legal defense team realized he’d inevitably lie, they negotiated the terms of a written interview, about which Trump was eager to boast .
“I write the answers.” Trump told reporters six months ago. “My lawyers don’t write answers, I write answers. I was asked a series of questions. I have answered them very easily. Very easily…. The questions were very routinely answered by me. By me. Okay?”
As it turns out, the Republican answered the questions “very easily” because it doesn’t take a lot of effort to skip over difficult lines of inquiry, while writing, “I don’t remember” in response to the others.
Trump has bragged more than once that he has “one of the great memories of all time” I’m starting to think that might not be altogether true.

Trump can't let go of his preoccupation with Obama | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-19-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-cant-let-go-his-preoccupation-obama,"By Steve Benen Donald Trump didn’t have a whole lot to say about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report yesterday afternoon, though the president did get around to sharing a predictable thought via Twitter: he blamed his predecessor.
“Anything the Russians did concerning the 2016 Election was done while Obama was President. He was told about it and did nothing! Most importantly, the vote was not affected.”
Nearly everything in Trump’s tweet was wrong. The vote was affected . Barack Obama did a lot more than “nothing,” and he would’ve done more were it not for Mitch McConnell’s opposition. The “anything the Russians did…” suggests Trump may still have some doubts as to the nature of the Russians’ attack, which is an issue that does not lend itself to skepticism.
But routine nonsense is less interesting to me than Trump’s ongoing preoccupation with the president who preceded him. I thought it was at least possible that the Republican, in time, would stop obsessing over the recent past, but by some measures, Trump fixates on Obama nearly as much as Hillary Clinton.
Yesterday, for example, Trump blamed Obama for the Russia attack. Earlier this week, Trump made up a story about hearing from a “big tough guy” who was “crying” because Obama ruined his life . Last week, Trump focused his attention on his approval rating – as compared to Obama’s .
Earlier that day, Trump tried to defend his family-separation policy by falsely claiming it was actually Obama’s policy . Four days earlier, Trump went after Joe Biden by condemning Obama .
Three days earlier, Trump told the National Republican Congressional Committee, “By the way, the carbon and all of the things flying up in the air, you know, the carbon footprint? President Obama used to talk about the carbon footprint and he’d hop on Air Force One, a big 747 with very old engines, and he’d fly to Hawaii to play a round of golf. Now, you tell me, the carbon footprint. But that’s the way it is.”
Obama, incidentally, never flew to Hawaii solely to play a round of golf.
The week before that, Trump suggested Obama was responsible for orchestrating a conspiratorial scheme against the Republican campaign in 2016.
I’m reminded of this Politico piece from two years ago which highlighted the Republican’s “obsession.”
Donald Trump just can’t quit Barack Obama.
From entering politics as the chief promoter of the birtherism conspiracy – complete with claims of mysterious calls coming in to him with new information to detectives he claimed he sent to Hawaii but were never heard from again – to waking up Saturday morning tweeting, “How low has President Obama gone to tapp [sic] my phones,” Obama’s always there for Trump.
Two years later, is anyone prepared to argue that Trump’s focus has changed?
As we discussed a while back, at a certain level, I can understand the fixation. Obama was a successful, popular president, whose stature appears even greater when compared to his successor.
But that’s all the more reason for Trump to choose a different foil.

* The due date is May 1: “House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., on Friday subpoenaed the Justice Department for the full, unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report as well as the underlying evidence.”
* An important detail : “Special counsel Robert Mueller’s criminal investigation may be over, but the FBI’s efforts to assess and counter Russian efforts to influence the U.S. political system – including the Trump administration – is continuing, current and former U.S. officials say.”
* Ohio : “A federal judge blocked part of an Ohio law late Thursday that bans the abortion method of dilation and evacuation in most cases, adding to a list of restrictions on the procedure that are or soon could be in legal limbo.”
* Remember him ? “Scott Pruitt, the scandal-ridden former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, registered as an energy lobbyist in Indiana on Thursday as fossil-fuels interests there are fighting to block the proposed closure of several coal-fired power plants.”
* Virginia : “Two Virginia police officers who worked for different agencies were fired this week after an anti-fascist group linked them to white nationalist organizations.”
* South Florida : “Federal authorities today announced that John Kless, a 49-year-old resident of Tamarac in Broward County, called three Democrats at their Washington, D.C. offices April 16 and left voicemail messages threatening murder.

"If Romney is 'sickened' by Mueller's revelations, what will he do? | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/if-romney-sickened-muellers-revelations-what-will-he-do,"By Steve Benen The vast majority of congressional Republicans have been willing to stick to the White House’s script in the wake of the Mueller report’s release, but we’ve seen a handful of notable exceptions.
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), for example, arguably Congress’ most moderate GOP member, told Maine Public Radio last week that the special counsel’s findings offered “an unflattering portrayal of the president.”
And if Collins had been in New Jersey in 1937, I suspect she might’ve described the Hindenburg as “an unfortunate transportation incident.”
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) went considerably further on Friday, issuing a written statement that read:
“It is good news that there was insufficient evidence to charge the President of the United States with having conspired with a foreign adversary or with having obstructed justice. The alternative would have taken us through a wrenching process with the potential for constitutional crisis. The business of government can move on.
“Even so, I am sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the President. I am also appalled that, among other things, fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia – including information that had been illegally obtained; that none of them acted to inform American law enforcement; and that the campaign chairman was actively promoting Russian interests in Ukraine.
“Reading the report is a sobering revelation of how far we have strayed from the aspirations and principles of the founders.”
The statement, not surprisingly, was not well received at the White House. Donald Trump, who’s had a strained relationship with the senator whom he considered for his cabinet, published a tweet on Saturday afternoon, mocking Romney’s defeat in the 2012 presidential election.
Putting aside the fact that Romney actually won a larger share of the popular vote than Trump, my concerns about the senator’s statement came from a very different angle.
To be sure, given that so few GOP officials were willing to say anything even remotely critical of the president, the fact that Romney responded to the Mueller report by throwing a few elbows seemed reassuring. Since Thursday morning, Republican principles have largely gone into hiding, so Romney’s public disgust stood out for a reason.
But the seven words that stood out for me in Romney’s statement were these: “The business of government can move on.”
In practical terms, the Utah Republican seems eager to have it both ways. On the one hand, Romney wants to take a stand, condemn Trump’s misdeeds, and position himself as the brave truth-teller in a party that’s too afraid of his party’s base to respond to the Mueller report with candor.
On the other hand, Romney doesn’t actually want to do anything of practical significance. His statement wasn’t intended to serve as the starting point for a conversation about how best to hold the president accountable for his transgressions; rather, the senator’s statement was apparently his end point.
After all, as Romney sees it, “The business of government can move on.”
But maybe it can’t? With the special counsel’s report detailing multiple instances in which the president lied, encouraged others to lie, and r epeatedly obstructed a federal investigation , is this really the best time to walk away from the revelations?
As the Washington Post ’s Michael Gerson noted late last week, “Already, Republicans are urging the country to move on. In this case, moving on would ignore and reward corruption on a grand scale.”

Giuliani: 'Nothing wrong' with getting campaign aid from foreign foe | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/giuliani-nothing-wrong-getting-campaign-aid-foreign-foe,"By Steve Benen Rudy Giuliani made multiple appearances on the Sunday shows yesterday, doing his best to pretend the Mueller report wasn’t devastating for his client in the Oval Office, and presenting a series of wildly unpersuasive arguments.
The Republican told CNN, for example, “There’s nothing wrong with taking information from Russians.” In reality, there’s plenty wrong with it. A foreign adversary launched a military intelligence operation against our elections, and the attack included stealing Americans’ materials.
For Donald Trump’s lawyers to insist there’s “nothing wrong with” a U.S. campaign accepting assistance from our international foes is to invite additional attacks.
On “Meet the Press,” Giuliani went on to tell NBC News’ Chuck Todd that the public had a “ right to know ” about the information contained in the materials the Russians stole. The former mayor compared hacked information to the Pentagon Papers.
But that’s absurd. Not only did the hacked emails not point to any Hillary Clinton wrongdoing, but Giuliani’s argument – an implicit defense of an illegal hack – could just as easily be applied to stealing others’ materials. If a hack produced the president’s tax returns, would Giuliani be equally cavalier about the public’s “right to know”?
But what struck me as especially notable was Giuliani’s response to a question about Sen. Mitt Romney’s (R-Utah) criticism . Here was the exchange between Trump’s lawyer and CNN’s Jake Tapper.
GIULIANI: What a hypocrite. What a hypocrite.
TAPPER: But why is that hypocritical?
GIULIANI: Any candidate – any candidate in the whole world, in America, would take information, negative [information].
In context, the former mayor was clearly referring to taking “information” from a foreign adversary.
Last summer, then-Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), one of Moscow’s favorites, made a similar argument, insisting “there’s not a person in this town” who wouldn’t welcome foreign intervention to win an election.
Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 5/23/18, 9:44 PM ET History highlights Trump's failure on Russian election outreach Rachel Maddow tells the story of how Adlai Stevenson, acting for the good of the country, not only rejected overtures of the Soviet Union to assist his presidential campaign but told his political rival, President Eisenhower about the matter. share tweet email save Embed The pitch hasn’t improved with age.
There’s no reason to speculate about how others might’ve acted under similar circumstances because there are some meaningful historical parallels. For example, Russia offered to help Adlai Stevenson win the White House in 1960 and held a meeting with the Illinois Democrat to offer Moscow’s assistance.
Stevenson refused, left the meeting, went home, and documented every detail he could remember. He then quickly went to the authorities , explaining that a foreign adversary had just tried to intervene in American presidential election.
Eight years later, when Russia offered similar assistance to Hubert Humphrey, that didn’t go well for the USSR, either.
“Any candidate in the whole world in America would take information” from Russia to win an election? Evidently not, Rudy.

* Prepare for a very problematic ruling : “The Supreme Court seemed willing Tuesday to let the Trump administration add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census form that goes to every U.S. household, despite claims from populous states that it would actually make the count less accurate.”
* The delay could take a while: “The House Oversight Committee has agreed to postpone its deadline for a subpoena of President Trump’s financial records until after a court rules on a lawsuit filed by the president on the matter, according to a court filing Tuesday.”
* A rare sight : ‘In a national first in the fight against the opioid crisis, a major drug distribution company, its former CEO and another top executive have been criminally charged in New York.”
* The latest on the Easter attacks : “Sri Lanka’s defense minister said Tuesday that the coordinated Easter Sunday attacks that killed at least 321 people were in retaliation for the recent Christchurch mosque massacre in New Zealand.”
* In case you missed this yesterday: “House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., issued a subpoena Monday to President Donald Trump’s former White House counsel Don McGahn for testimony and documents as part the panel’s investigation into possible obstruction of justice by the president and others.”
* An underappreciated point : “Climate change creates winners and losers. Norway is among the winners; Nigeria among the losers. Those are the stark findings of a peer-reviewed paper by two Stanford University professors who have tried to quantify the impact of rising greenhouse gas emissions on global inequality.”
* Even for him, this was weird phrasing: “Trump claimed the New York Times had apologized to him after the 2016 election and that if they wanted his forgiveness again, they’d have to make a real gesture out of the apology: ‘Get down on their knees and beg for forgiveness.’” (Keep in mind, the newspaper never apologized to him, and it’s unclear why he keeps saying it did.)
* Consistent with a larger pattern: “President Donald Trump opened a new flank in his battle against illegal immigration on Monday when he ordered his administration to crack down on ‘visa overstays’ – foreigners who legally enter the country but remain in the U.S. after their visas expire.”
* From Team Trump to Facebook : “Facebook has hired Jennifer Newstead, a President Donald Trump-appointed legal adviser at the State Department, as its new general counsel as the company faces scrutiny from governments around the world over how it manages content and data on its sprawling social network.”
