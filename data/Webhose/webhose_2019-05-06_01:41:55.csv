He added that the DRAP had allowed only nine percent MRPs increase in hardship category and only 15 percent MRPs increase of medicines determined under the Drug Pricing Policy, 2018 for drugs other than those specified in clause (a).
He said the federal government had issued clear directions to DRAP to take strict action against pharmaceutical companies selling medicines on exorbitant prices.
He said the Authority had recommended registering of cases on overpriced medicines under the Drug Act, besides imposing heavy fines with recovery of overpriced amount. He said cases would be registered against the companies on overpricing for recovery of the overpriced amount.�� He said action had also been taken on receiving various complaints that pharmaceutical companies had increased prices of their drugs over and above the maximum retail price (MRPs) approved by the federal government .� He said the ministry had also directed DRAP to conduct market surveys for determination of overpricing.

WILLIAMS, PH.D. 7 Apr 2019 The number of Catholics in Australia fell by a significant 2.7 percent between 2011 and 2016, the National Center for Pastoral Research reported last week. Analyzing national census data from the most recent available year (2016), the center reported that the Catholic population had dropped from 5.4 million in 2011 to some 5.3 million in 2016 in its “Social Profile of the Catholic Community in Australia.”
The rapid decline in Australia’s Catholic population was even more dramatic as a percentage of the total population, the center found, falling from 25.3 percent of the population to just 22.6 percent, a decrease of 12 percent in just five years.
The center also noted that a higher percentage of Catholics were born overseas than five years earlier, and often immigrated from non-English-speaking countries.
Almost a quarter of Australia’s Catholics (24.7 percent) are immigrants. Nearly 20 percent of Catholics (19.1 percent) were born outside of Australia in non-English-speaking countries, the center reported, while another 5.6 percent had immigrated from English-speaking nations.
Although the percentage of Catholics in the total population is the highest among all religions, it is overshadowed by the number of Australians who identify with no religion at all, a group that makes up 30.1 percent of the population.
“The drop in the number of Catholics is concerning and the bishops are keen to understand what’s behind it and respond as positively as possible,” said Archbishop Mark Coleridge of Brisbane, president of the Australian bishops’ conference.
Archbishop Coleridge said that the decline in affiliation with the Catholic Church has been compounded by a drop in religious practice among Catholics, and speculated that government investigations and “related revelations about child sexual abuse as well as a general drift away from religious practice and a broader trend of disaffiliation” have affected Australia’s Catholic population.
Last month, an Australian judge sentenced Cardinal George Pell to six years in prison for sexual abuse, following a secret trial that was widely perceived as a travesty of justice.
The former head of the Vatican’s doctrinal office, the German Cardinal Gerhard Müller, said that the accusations against Pell were “absolutely unbelievable. It’s impossible. It’s without proof, against all evidence.”
Another observer, Canon lawyer Ed Condon, said that the presumption of innocence easily becomes a “legal fiction” when judging decades-old sex abuse charges with no corroborating evidence.
Such a case obliges jurors to choose “between the word of the accuser and that of the accused,” he said.
Not all the recent news was bad for Catholics, however, and the National Center for Pastoral Research, which assists the Australian Catholic Church in understanding the cultural, social, and personal dimensions of religions throughout the country, found that Catholics are more than twice as likely to have a university degree than two decades ago.
The Australian bishops intend to use the findings of the report to assist in planning in ministry development to better cater to the real needs of the population.
“All of this is important data as we plan for a very different future, given that any effective planning needs to be based on fact, not fantasy,” Archbishop Coleridge said.

DUBAI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 07th Apr, 2019) The Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement signed between the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia has come into effect at the beginning of this month, after both countries completed the necessary procedures in accordance with their regulations.
The UAE , represented by the Ministry of Finance, MoF, signed the agreement with Saudi Arabia on the avoidance of double taxation on income and capital and the prevention of tax evasion, at the Saudi Ministry of Finance in Jeddah in May 2018 .
The agreement aims to strengthen the cooperation in tax matters and consolidate the financial, economic and investment partnership between the two countries. This is in line with the UAE 's efforts to increase investment opportunities, encourage trade, and meet the country's development goals through the diversification of sources of national income and full protection of goods and services.
Younis Haji Al Khoori, Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, affirmed that the agreement is an important step in enhancing bilateral relations between the two countries, especially in financial and economic spheres. ""This agreement will contribute to a more flexible investment climate that will underscore the country's position as a key destination for Saudi investments. This agreement represents a qualitative leap forward in terms of the framework of financial, economic and tax cooperation between GCC countries,"" he added.
He further stated, ""The Ministry of Finance aims to expand the network of bilateral double taxation avoidance agreements with various countries around the world to fulfil the vision of the wise leadership of the state in diversifying sources of income and advancing the development objectives of the state.
""These agreements contribute to the elimination of double taxation, facilitate cross-border trade and investment flows, and provide protection to taxpayers from direct and indirect double taxation. This in turn enhances the country's investment climate and makes it more attractive as a destination for foreign investment.""
Investments of Saudi citizens and banks in the UAE were valued at AED17.08 billion in 2017 , whereas the number of economic activity licenses granted to Saudi citizens in the UAE reached 12,451 by end of 2017 . According to official statistics, the volume of trade between Saudi Arabia and the UAE reached AED32.93 billion in 2017 , and the number of Saudi shareholders in the UAE joint stock companies reached 118,878 during the same year. The value of real estate transactions for Saudi nationals in the UAE was AED59 billion in 2017 , while the total number of property owners in the UAE was estimated at 4,989 by end of 2017 .
The UAE is ranked second worldwide and first in the Arab world in terms of the number of avoidance of double taxation agreements. The number of agreements concluded between 1989 and 2018 reached 210, including 123 agreements to avoid double taxation, as well as 87 agreements to regulate and encourage investment, highlighting the country's efforts in spreading knowledge related to double taxation issues in the region and worldwide.
The UAE is a strategic partner of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, in raising awareness of the importance of tax treaty issues at a regional level. This partnership has been recently strengthened by signing the three-year (2019-2021) extension of the Memorandum of Understanding, MoU, between the UAE and OECD. The MoU aims to provide support and assistance to countries in the MENA region in terms of tax conventions, and stipulates mutual cooperation between both parties in developing a better understanding of the practical application of international tax principles.

ISLAMABAD, Apr 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) : Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday said the country could have got rid of money laundering, if Hudaibiya case was decided on merit and the Sharif family was not given an NRO (National Reconciliation Ordinance) by Pervez Musharraf .
The prime minister , in a meeting with Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain, said unfortunately the NRO in Hudaibiya case was used as a precedent in all the succeeding cases. The Hudaibiya case model was used in all the cases surfaced so far in which money was laundered abroad through front men and brought back later, he added.
Even in the cases of Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari , the use of very model had been exposed, he remarked.
The prime minister directed the Information Minister to disseminate all such details to the masses to expose the real face of public detractors. He also asked the minister to apprise the people about the adverse impact of their (Nawaz and Zardari ) misdeeds on the national economy consequently making them face the inflation and foreign debts.
He said there must be an accountability into the use of $60 billion foreign debt obtained during last 10 years, besides finding out as to who had transferred such huge amount to their personal accounts making the people to bear the burden.
He said the rules and regulations formulated by the incumbent government under the Benami law would help curb money laundering, besides discouraging the practice of holding the properties in fictitious Names . Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

That Doesn’t Exonerate Her. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had a clear message for Democrats Sunday: Don’t hold your breath. Mulvaney expressed certainty that congressional Democrats would not be able to move forward with their plan to get the IRS to deliver President Donald Trump’s tax returns. “Oh no, never—nor should they,” Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday when asked whether Democrats will ever see the documents that Trump has long refused to release . “That’s an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns. They knew that he didn’t and they elected him anyway.” In Mulvaney’s view, the question of Trump’s tax returns shouldn’t even be on the table because the voters already made clear they don’t really care what they contain. “Keep in mind, that’s an issue that was already litigated during the election,” Mulvaney said. “Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn’t, and they elected him anyway—which, of course, is what drives the Democrats crazy.” MIck Mulvaney says that the democrats will never see President Trump's taxes and that they know they won't #FNS pic.twitter.com/DDjFmjGz8f — FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) April 7, 2019 Mulvaney said Democrats won’t be surprised by his words because they “know they’re not going to” get the returns but characterized the request as part of a strategy to avoid policy discussions. “If they don’t get what they want in the Mueller report, they’re going to ask for the taxes,” Mulvaney said. “If they don’t get what they want in the taxes, they’re going to ask for something else. It doesn’t surprise anybody.” House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal formally asked this past week for the IRS to hand over six years of Trump’s personal and business tax returns . Trump later joked that asking for six years could be a sign that Democrats are “giving up” but insisted he has no plans on releasing the documents using the same old excuse he has been uttering since the campaign. “Is that all? Usually it’s 10,” Trump said . “So I guess they’re giving up. No, we’re under audit, despite what people said, and we’re working that out—I’m always under audit, it seems, but I’ve been under audit for many years, because the numbers are big, and I guess when you have a name, you’re audited. But until such time as I’m not under audit, I would not be inclined to do that.” TRUMP on House request for his tax returns:“I'm always under audit, it seems, but I've been under audit for many years because the numbers are big, and I guess when you have a name, you're audited.

I quit my job reporting on politics at the Alaska State Capitol on March 14. Boom. Done. I told myself after I quit that I’d never work for a newspaper again, not on a full-time basis anyways.
After a long week of wind and rain the sun came out on Tuesday, March 19, and temperatures peaked above 50 degrees for the first time this year. You might remember that day if you were in Juneau because everybody – I saw druggies tweaking, families skipping rocks in the channel, Rep. George Rauscher on the phone, the cops were on their bikes – it was beautiful outside. We Alaskans were all basking beneath the sun’s brilliant light. If you’re an Alaskan you know these kind of days. You cannot beat them.
I spent that day wandering along the pier admiring the green hills on Douglas Island, watching the tide go out, reflecting on my life trying to figure out what the hell I should do next. I had a plane ticket to Portland at the time, but I didn’t have a plan beyond flying to PDX and looking for work. Advertisement. For information about purchasing ads, please click here .
Jeff Landfield had previously approached me about publishing some freelance opinion pieces for the Landmine. As I began unpacking my life on that sunny day, I realized I could not encapsulate what I have to say into one or two focused op-eds. So I messaged Jeff and told him I wanted to write something else. I’ve been working on this for the last two weeks or so.
So here we go:
It became clear to me I needed to find a new job in early February, but I wanted to continue reporting at the Capitol. I tried to find a way to stay put. First, I started exploring freelance writing opportunities. There were a few opportunities but it was not enough money to make rent and pay bills. So, I looked into part-time jobs to bolster my income while freelancing. I interviewed for a job in the tourism industry in Juneau too. Nothing was panning out for me.
I even looked into “Unleashing Entrepreneurialism” as a means of supporting my journalism habit.
I mocked up a business plan for a hot dog stand. I believed I could run a successful hot dog stand since I have experience in grilling hot dogs in my personal and professional life. My first job out of college was slingin’ wieners at the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials in Eugene, Oregon. We served the athletes and their fans hundreds of hot dogs every day. It was fun work and the wiener jokes were abundant.
My business plan was to post-up outside the state Capitol and shout “We’re open for business!” and serve “Dunleavy Dogs” to the hungry, tired masses as they leave the Capitol and migrate downhill. These Dunleavy Dogs would be 6.7 inch wieners on an “Honest Sustainable Bun.” These Honest Sustainable Buns would be a foot long to trick customers into thinking they’re getting a good deal. There would be no condiments on a Dunleavy Dog because I’d need to spare unnecessary business expenses. When the customer bites into a Dunleavy Dog their taste buds are met with extreme disappointment.
Slingin’ wieners outside the Capitol seemed like a great idea but nobody would invest. Go figure. Advertisement. For information about purchasing ads, please click here .
In the end the dollars didn’t add up. Juneau’s an expensive place to live. I finally hit a breaking point and quit. I took the milk run out of Alaska on Monday, March 25. The irony of leaving Alaska on Seward’s Day is not lost on me.
Part II: Something stinks
There’s an ugly stench emanating from the third floor of the Alaska State Capitol building. I can smell it from Portland, Oregon as I follow what is happening in Alaska. I’m sure the people of Fairbanks or Bethel or Nome can smell it too.
Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s budget has instilled fear among state employees, teachers, and university staff as they stare at the prospect of unemployment. Business owners are concerned about the recession worsening. Mr. Dunleavy’s proposal to privatize and limit the services of the Alaska Marine Highway System has many Alaskans in coastal communities wondering if they will be left stranded. Seniors worry about their future in the Pioneer homes. Others worry about Alaska’s future as Dunleavy buries his head in the thawing permafrost and ignores climate change. The list could go on.
Mr. Dunleavy, you ran on a campaign slogan of “Standing Tall for Alaskans,” but what you’re proposing to do is take a shit on them.
Mr. Honest Budget, next time you plan a budget roadshow, don’t hide behind Americans for Prosperity and their arbitrary rules that encumber the public process.
Mr. Governor, next time Alaskans protest your abysmal policy proposals on the steps of the Capitol, I’d love to see you greet them. I’d love to see you explain to members of the Inland Boatman’s Union, to their faces, why their jobs are expendable. Explain to these ferry system workers why your salary provides a better service to Alaskans than theirs.
Lucky for Alaskans, the legislators in Senate and House Finance Committees are not dumb enough to drink Dunleavy’s shit flavored Kool-Aid. Co-Chairs of Senate Finance, Bert Stedman (R-Sitka) and Natasha von Imhof (R-Anchorage), deserve more kudos than they have received thus far. Stedman is standing taller than Dunleavy ever has as he fights for the Marine Highway System.
Von Imhof has made what is arguably the most important statement of the legislative session thus far:
“I keep hearing the administration referring to this ‘fiscal crisis.’ We don’t have a fiscal crisis,” she said during a Feb. 21 finance meeting, according to an Anchorage Daily News article. “We have a priority crisis. We have enough money to pay for a certain level of government services and a certain level of dividend. We just don’t have enough to pay for both at the highest level desired.” Advertisement.

Alaska does not have to be this way. Yet Dunleavy persists.
Sens. Bill Wielechwoski (D-Anchorage), Mike Shower (R-Wasilla), Donny Olson (D-Golovin), and Lyman Hoffman (D-Bethel), have been outstanding in Senate Finance too. Their line of questioning, and insight has been enlightening as they’ve grilled members of the Dunleavy administration on the budget.
On the House side, the Finance Committee has launched its own budget roadshow. No dumb rules. No Americans for Prosperity. Kudos to House Finance Co-Chairs Neal Foster (D-Nome) and Tammie Wilson (R-North Pole) for showing what real leadership is.
Since Dunleavy and many in his administration do not seem to give a damn about the people who will lose their jobs as a direct result of Dunleavy’s budget, I have an idea. Since it’s difficult to tell whether or not Dunleavy gives a damn about the people who will be missing out on essential services that he proposes to cut, I have a suggestion. My proposal is for Alaska’s Senate or House Finance Committees. I want to see the creation of a finance subcommittee on Thoughts and Prayers Assistance, or TAPASS. The purpose of this TAPASS subcommittee would be to comb through the budget bill and find each provision that would result in a job loss or cut needed services. The TAPASS subcommittee’s next task would be to add amendments to the budget bill containing language that assures those soon-to-be-unemployed Alaskans, or other effected Alaskans, that the Dunleavy administration’s thoughts and prayers are being sent to those people. I’m sure it will alleviate their pain.
Part III: Some random thoughts on journalism
I never worked in journalism for the money. The pay has never been great, but I got by. I am a journalist because I believe in journalism and what it can accomplish. I do it because I like telling important stories. In a single day, working as a newspaper reporter you can run the gamut of emotions. In the end it’s satisfying work, which is why it is so hard to walk away.
Alaska needs a strong Capitol press corps. That press corps has become exponentially important this legislative session as Alaska nears the edge. If you don’t think good journalism matters, just imagine where Alaska would be today if journalists weren’t digging into Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s so-called honest budget? Has the Dunleavy administration shown it understands transparency?
Despite all the good newspapers do, I am frustrated by the industry. During the last six years I’ve seen my friends in the newspaper business struggle to pay their bills. I’ve seen my friends stressed to a breaking point. I’ve seen my friends cry in frustration. Many journalists feel undervalued and wonder if it’s worth it to continue. I’ve seen talent move on from newspapers to new fields – grad school, public relations, union labor, law, web, coding, etc. — I cannot blame them.
In the end self-preservation will win out no matter how much a reporter loves working in newspapers. And it did with me too.
Throughout my career I heard of newspaper strikes happening in a bygone era when newspapers were king. Sometimes I wonder why Alaska journalists don’t unionize. What do Alaska’s journalists have to lose?
There’s this sense of entitlement among news consumers who feel that news must be free. That is infuriating. During a fairly recent conversation at the Triangle Club Bar in Juneau, a man told me news should be free. He scoffed at the idea of paying for a newspaper subscription. I asked this man what line of work he is in. He said he was a helicopter pilot. I asked him how successful his business would be if patrons demanded free helicopter rides simply because they were entitled to free rides.
A subscription to the Juneau Empire costs $0.99 for the first month and $9.95/month thereafter. A subscription to the Anchorage Daily News costs $11.99/month. An online subscription to the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner costs $14.99/month. A subscription to any one of Alaska’s big three newspapers would cost you no more than $0.50 per day. If you don’t like how much your newspaper has shrunk in the last decade, consider your subscription an investment into the product.
As newsroom staff decrease at Alaska’s traditional newspapers, independent media continues to play an increasingly important role. Say what you will about Jeff Landfield’s Landmine, Dermot Cole’s columns, or Matt Buxton at the Midnight Sun – there is no denying they are breaking important news and they’re doing it in a fun way. These journalists have the freedom to do journalism on their own terms. They’re not being held down by the traditional rules of journalism, which are at times arbitrary. Yes, their posts are interspersed with editorial opinion, which readers should be aware of. However, their body of work remains important. I hope to see more of independent media in the future.
Journalists get a lot of bullshit criticism based off reader assumptions or readers being blinded by their own bias (Yes, you can read your own bias into a completely neutral story. Think about that!). As frustration with the Dunleavy administration and this legislative session grows, I’ve seen important discussions on Alaska Twitter about journalism, its quality, its purpose, people’s frustrations with the media – journalism in Alaska is being critiqued. Good. Journalism must improve. Journalists should engage. The world is rapidly evolving. Is journalism keeping pace?
Part IV: Last words
As I put the finishing touches on this article I’m sitting on a pink couch in Portland’s Alphabet District. My belly is full of pancakes and I’m drinking coffee. I’ve been thinking about Alaska and where it’s headed during the last 24 hours as I try to figure out how the hell I should end this article.
I hope you Alaskans keep fighting. I like how Alaskans are reacting to this session. Alaskans are getting pissed. Alaskans are protesting. Alaskans are educating themselves. They are reading the news and engaging in the public process. Alaskans must let Gov. Mike Dunleavy know that Alaska is a lot bigger than the Anchorage/Mat-Su region. You would think with his lofty 6-foot, 7-inch viewpoint he’d be able to see the rest of Alaska.
Keep fighting for your children’s future. Do it for your friends. Do it for the methheads and heroin addicts who have been forgotten on the streets. Do it for the orcas and the bears and the environment. Do it for yourself because you deserve a good life.
Alaska can be a challenging place to live. Generations have worked hard and died for Alaska to be as it is today. If you’re familiar with the state’s history you know that many lives have been crushed throughout Alaska’s often tragic history. Don’t let Dunleavy crush yours.

Coventry police arrested a man who they say pointed a gun at two people who were driving by his house this weekend.
Christopher R. Digman, 35, was charged with two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and carrying a weapon while intoxicated, the Coventry police said.
Detectives seized several weapons, including the handgun that they say Digman pulled on the two men.
Police said they went to 312 Pulaski St. just after midnight Sunday for a report about the incident. The two men told them that the resident of 312 Pulaski St. “had confronted them as they were driving by his house,” police said. Words were exchanged, then Digman pulled out a handgun and pointed it at them, police said.
The two men escaped the area unharmed, police said. A search of 312 Pulaski St. turned up the guns that police seized. Never miss a story

NBA: Take Spurs (-8.5) vs. Cavs
From a motivational standpoint the Cavs really don't have a lot to play for here. Combine that with the edge San Antonio has in coaching and on-court talent and there is a lot to like about the Spurs in this situation.
NBA: Take Wizards (-4) vs. Knicks
Both teams are likely out of the playoff race here, but it's clear from the effort on the court that the Knicks are mailing it in the rest of the way. There is some solid line value here since the Wizards are on the road. There is no reason to believe the Knicks actually have any home-court advantage right now.
 Teams with a plus number are underdogs. Teams with a minus number are favorites."

Andrade Journal Staff Writer Kevprojo Sunday Apr 7, 2019 at 12:30 AM Apr 7, 2019 at 8:45 AM
EAST PROVIDENCE — The Haven United Methodist Church may strike people as an odd place to present a conference on the history of baseball. Yet local historians gathered there Saturday afternoon to listen to Francis Leazes speak about Providence's Kinsley Avenue and the Titanic.
""I cannot drive by the corner of Kinsley and Acorn without thinking about the Titanic,"" the Rhode Island College professor of political science and public administration told about 20 attendees at the lecture, ""Extra Innings: In Search of Historic Baseball Venues."" It was part of Rhode Island's 34th annual Statewide Historic Preservation Conference, this year focusing on preservation, recreation and sport.
The Titanic connection is related to Kinsley Park, a baseball field and city recreation hot spot that hosted Negro League games as well as integrated games between teams of black players and white players.
The park was on property owned by the Southern New England Railway, which was planned but never built, by tycoon Charles Melville Hays. He died in the Titanic disaster in 1912, and on his person were found money and plans for the railroad. Today, the property is a parking lot.
After Hays' death, his company leased the property.
According to Robert Cvornyek, a professor of sports history at RIC, the first professional baseball game there happened in 1921 between the Cleveland Colored Giants — a team made up of black players — and the Providence Independents — made up of white players.
The setup was part of an experiment called the International League, but soon afterward, the Colored Giants would call Providence home while keeping the Cleveland name at the outset.
""After that game, the league collapsed and they were stranded in Rhode Island,"" Cvornyek said.
Three years later, under the auspices of Arthur ""Daddy"" Black, a businessman who made his money ""playing the numbers,"" Cvornyek said, the team became the Providence Giants and played games against white teams as well as black teams. It was one of the last attempts to commercialize black baseball before the Great Depression hit.
""Sad thing is, 'Daddy' Black walked away [in 1931] from the project because it wasn't as profitable as he hoped,"" Cvornyek said.
That year, Black sold the team to Daniel Whitehead, a local baseball player more interested in the sport than the business end of operations. He changed the team's payments to players from a monthly salary to one based on ticket sales, and ""the players mutinied as a result,"" Cvornyek said. ""For all intents, commercial black baseball is dead after that.
""So, Kinsley Park is sacred ground for black baseball.""

Trump Economic Adviser Refuses To 'Litigate' Sexual Harassment Allegations Against Herman Cain,crooksandliars.com,Heather,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/trump-economic-adviser-refuses-litigate,"
Trump Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow was asked about his boss' completely reckless recommendation of Herman Cain to sit on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, and the allegations of sexual harassment against him during his 2012 presidential campaign by CNN's Jake Tapper, and surprise, surprise, Kudlow refused to answer whether he found the allegations ""disturbing"" or not.
If he wasn't ""disturbed"" enough to turn down a job working for Trump in the first place, I'm not sure why anyone thinks the allegations against Cain are going to bother him.
TAPPER: The question is, are these the best two people that he could pick. You know you that you're going to face questions about this. Herman Cain dropped out of the 2012 presidential race because of numerous sexual harassment allegations, multiple women. He denies them all. […]
There are at least four women that have allegations like this. Again, Cain denies they're true, but doesn't this trouble you?
KUDLOW: Look, we are going through a vetting process in the White House. I'm sure the Senate banking committee will do likewise. There's big disputes here. Mr. Cain disagrees with this point of view. I'm not going to litigate that here.
TAPPER: It's four women. It's not just one.
KUDLOW: Well, Lord knows, in this town, you know, I come here to work in the White House once every 35 years. It's very toxic here. More than I've ever seen. I don't want to...
TAPPER: Larry, nobody has made allegations like this about you or me, I mean, like...
KUDLOW: That is true. You and I, we are on the road to heaven. There's no question about that.
TAPPER: You know what I'm saying.
KUDLOW: I think this stuff, look, we've seen -- whether it's Supreme Court justices or many other things, we've seen a lot of charges here. They don't necessarily pan out. Again, let me make this generic point on behalf of the president and Mr. Cain and Mr. Moore, a 3.8 percent unemployment rate, this is fabulous, an economy that's growing at better than 3 percent, could do better even with tax cuts and deregulation. ↓ Story continues below ↓
We worry that the Central Bank is not taking account of a weak world economy, some financial tightening in the marketplace, and here is the key point, there is no inflation. So look, I'm not here to buck Fed independence. I started my career at the New York Fed many years ago. I get along well with the Fed officials.
I'm just saying we have two open seats on the board. The president has every right in the world to nominate people who share his economic philosophy. That is more people working is a good thing, not a bad thing.
TAPPER: Okay, you didn't answer the question necessarily about those allegations troubling you or not. Tags:"

In other words, socialism. But yeah. That guy does nothing but serve up word salads. Capitalism works just fine when the government stays the hell out of the way.

Dude is definitely a salesman and a politician, no doubt about it. Democratic capitalism is just a rebrand of socialism. Either way the means of production are being controlled publicly.
— Ryan Farmer (@CecilScribe) April 7, 2019 It's funny how socialists use the term ""democratic"" when describing their desire to control people and businesses.""We three wolves voted and the results are in: We're eating two sheep for dinner.""

During an event sponsored by Al Sharpton, radical Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was HAMMERED for being “financially illiterate” in relation to ruining the Amazon New York deal.
At the National Action Network event, Ocasio-Cortez talked mostly about her disastrous ‘Green New Deal’ that calls for the end to gas cars, planes and even cow farts. She also oddly noted that her deal will also address reparations for black people which has become a new idea for the Left. This is probably because the black vote is slipping from Left’s hands so they feel the need to literally pay the African American community to get their vote back.
Just hours before her speech however, the CEO of Advent Capital Management, Tracy Maitland, slammed anyone who opposed the New York Amazon deal which led to the loss of 25,000 potential jobs and billions in tax revenue.
“The people campaigning against the Amazon campus are financially illiterate,” he said.
Later on, he accused Ocasio-Cortez of spreading misinformation which ultimately killed the deal.
“This was a disgrace. I partially blame AOC for the loss of Amazon. She doesn’t know what she doesn’t know. That’s scary. We have to make sure she’s better educated or vote her out of office,” he noted.
It didn’t end there. The chairman of the City University of New York Bill Thompson pilled on and mentioned how the people who were most impacted by Ocasio-Cortez’s destruction of the Amazon deal were black and latino students.
POLL: Do you stand with TRUMP in his fight for the border wall?
“We were at the table talking to Amazon on how students could get jobs. … Those opportunities were snatched away,” Thompson stated.
“Those students look like us. … We’re talking thousands of high-paying jobs. It was a disappointment from a CUNY perspective.”
This wasn’t the only instance at the event where the young congresswoman made a total buffoon of herself. During the same event, Ocasio-Cortez appeared to take a page out the Hillary Clinton playbook and fake a southern accent during a speech to “appeal” to her audience.

“I’m proud to be a bartender. Ain’t nothing wrong that.” Ocasio-Cortez stated while talking in her fake accent. “There’s nothing wrong with working retail…There is nothing wrong with preparing that your neighbors will eat.”
Watch the cringeworthy video below: Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: ""I'm proud to be a bartender. Ain't nothing wrong that. There's nothing wrong with working retail…There is nothing wrong with preparing that your neighbors will eat.""

This concept of having an accent to appeal to your audience is quite odd. As a politician, it is very important to be authentic and transparent.
SPECIAL OFFER: Free Trump 2020 Hat While Supplies Last
Faking an accent is anything but authentic. One of the reasons why President Trump has been so successful is because he is 100% authentic no matter where he is and no matter who he is talking to.
Another day in America means another day where Ocasio-Cortez is embarrassing herself. The young socialist is making it increasingly clear that she has absolutely no idea what she is doing.

Rep. John Lewis on the Fire at the Highlander Center & the 51st Anniversary of King’s Death,johnlewis.house.gov,219,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://johnlewis.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-john-lewis-fire-highlander-center-51st-anniversary-king-s-death,"Rep. John Lewis on the Fire at the Highlander Center & the 51st Anniversary of King’s Death April 4, 2019 Press Release
I was disturbed to learn that just a few days before the 51st anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s death, a fire burned the main building of the Highlander Research and Education Center in Knoxville, Tennessee. Some of the archives of a priceless history were lost. White power graffiti was also discovered there, raising questions about whether the fire was started by an arsonist who wanted to deliver a message of hate.
Sixty years ago, the center was called the Highlander Folk School , founded by Myles Horton and located in Monteagle, Tennessee. Horton had been a student of a powerful theologian of the day, Reinhold Neibhur , a philosopher, among others, students in the Nashville sit-in movement studied under the leadership of the Reverend James Lawson . The school’s early focus was on the ideas of the labor movement and in making adult education more accessible to people in Appalachia. But once Brown v. Board of Education was decided in 1954, Highlander shifted its mission to tackle the thorny issues of racial integration, teaching everyone it could to respect the dignity of all humankind. It was a haven for Dr. King, a place where he could go to relax and repair his spirit in the glow of its “noble and creative work”.
It was at Highland Folk School that I shared a meal for the first time in my life in an integrated setting. I was a young adult, but I had never eaten a meal in the company of black and white diners. Highlander was the place that Rosa Parks witnessed a demonstration of equality that helped inspire her to keep her seat on a Montgomery bus, just a few after her first visit. She saw Septima Clark , a legendary black educator, teaching side-by-side with Horton. For her it was revolutionary. She had never seen an integrated team of equals working together, and it inspired her.
If Dr. King were here today, his words would ring so clear. He would say it is not so much a question of who but what. What is it that makes us feel threatened by a center that promotes peace and the brotherhood of all humankind? And what makes us believe that destroying a building will end the divine mandate of human unity? He would say, “The real problem is that through our scientific genius we've made of the world a neighborhood, but through our moral and spiritual genius we've failed to make of it a brotherhood.”
When Dr. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, some people hoped that his vision of humanity would die with him. But on this anniversary of his death, at a time when activism is again rising to the forefront and the demand for progressive change is more insistent and persistent, it should be more plain than ever before that you can kill a man, but you cannot kill an idea whose time has come. On this anniversary of his death, let us remind ourselves that the unity of all human kind is our inevitable end. It is either non-violence or non-existence. ####"
