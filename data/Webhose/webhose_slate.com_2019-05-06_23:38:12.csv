Texas Tech's defense puts Michigan State in a straightjacket.,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/texas-techs-defense-michigan-state-final-four.html,"Reds-Pirates Kerfuffle Results in Five Ejections, One Inspiring Image Michigan State has a good offense—excuse me: Michigan State had a good offense. The Spartans came up against Texas Tech in the Final Four on Saturday and, despite a valiant, late comeback attempt, the Big Ten champions spent most of the night twisting about in matching straightjackets. Texas Tech won, 61-51, setting up a rock fight with Virginia in Monday’s national championship game. Owens AGAIN! 🚫 @TexasTechMBB holds the 2 point lead at the half! #FinalFour pic.twitter.com/2Ye5nAMvPd — NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness) April 7, 2019 Texas Tech has a historically efficient defense, and it has been doing this sort of thing all season. The confused stupor in which Michigan State wandered the court on Saturday? That’s the norm, and Texas Tech prevents its opponents from playing what you or I would define as basketball. They’re forced to participate in some sort of calisthenic escape room, and they spend 40 minutes learning that the whole thing is rigged against them. Heading into the Final Four, the Spartans were ranked 5th in offensive efficiency according to KenPom.com , and they had the most total assists across Division I basketball, averaging 18.6 a game. But against the Red Raiders, nothing worked. They shot 32.6 percent from the field and only managed 6 total assists. Were it not for the foul line, Michigan State wouldn’t have cracked 40 points. The Red Raiders’ defense is so good, they were able to withstand a subpar offensive game from future NBA lottery pick Jarrett Culver. The star swingman was quiet for most of the night, though he emerged during crunch time and scored 7 of his 10 points inside the final two minutes and 30 seconds of action. JARRETT CULVER = CLUTCH @TexasTechMBB up 7 with 54 secs left to play! #FinalFour pic.twitter.com/EHuoiD07y8 — NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness) April 7, 2019 Other players stepped up for Texas Tech, like transfer guard Matt Mooney, who had a game-high 22 points. Springy forward Tariq Owens was in the middle of all the action on Saturday, including his very own Willis Reed moment when he emerged from the tunnel after suffering what had initially looked to be a serious injury. The Red Raiders' crowd goes wild as Tariq Owens returns from the locker room after an injury! 👏 @TexasTechMBB | #FinalFour pic.twitter.com/hRtJBSdovw — NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness) April 7, 2019 For lovers of free-flowing, fast offense, Monday’s national championship game between Texas Tech and Virginia will be about as watchable as a horse-track euthanasia. Each team lives and dies by its ability to stifle opponents, and the title may come down to a half-pint version of Lawler’s Law : First to 50 wins. But don’t blame the finalists—spoiling others’ fun is how they got here."

NBC In what veteran political observers are calling “the worst news for Joe Biden’s presidential hopes since people figured out he was that Joe Biden ,” Saturday Night Live dedicated the entire cold open to the former Vice President’s habit of not respecting women’s personal space .That’s after a week in which Donald Trump did so many hilariously stupid things it required a bulleted list , from claiming that the noise from wind turbines causes cancer to telling the world he plans to nominate Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve Board . Maybe Alec Baldwin wasn’t available this week, maybe Kenan Thompson didn’t want to reprise his role as Cain , but whatever the extenuating circumstances, the writers at SNL looked at seven days’ worth of primo, Grade A American garbage and concluded that Joe Biden was not just ridiculous, but cold open ridiculous, so much so that they got Jason Sudeikis to come back to play him. I’m not saying that Saturday Night Live should be the only factor to consider when deciding how to vote in the Democratic primaries—I’m just saying I don’t remember the last time Elizabeth Warren was the subject of an entire SNL cold open: Sudeikis’ Biden is always funny, even in a not-great sketch, and although this is definitely a not-great sketch, it has a few flashes of the ol’ Biden magic. The ex-veep’s attempt to shimmy his way through sensitivity training to the strains of Lou Rawls’ “You’ll Never Find Another Love Like Mine” is gold, and of the two (!) sketches this week that included jokes about Leslie Jones sticking her fingers up someone’s butt, this was definitely funnier than the one set in a colorectal health clinic . But the best thing in the sketch seems to have been the work of someone in the art department rather than any of the cast members.

That Doesn’t Exonerate Her. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had a clear message for Democrats Sunday: Don’t hold your breath. Mulvaney expressed certainty that congressional Democrats would not be able to move forward with their plan to get the IRS to deliver President Donald Trump’s tax returns. “Oh no, never—nor should they,” Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday when asked whether Democrats will ever see the documents that Trump has long refused to release . “That’s an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns. They knew that he didn’t and they elected him anyway.” In Mulvaney’s view, the question of Trump’s tax returns shouldn’t even be on the table because the voters already made clear they don’t really care what they contain. “Keep in mind, that’s an issue that was already litigated during the election,” Mulvaney said. “Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn’t, and they elected him anyway—which, of course, is what drives the Democrats crazy.” MIck Mulvaney says that the democrats will never see President Trump's taxes and that they know they won't #FNS pic.twitter.com/DDjFmjGz8f — FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) April 7, 2019 Mulvaney said Democrats won’t be surprised by his words because they “know they’re not going to” get the returns but characterized the request as part of a strategy to avoid policy discussions. “If they don’t get what they want in the Mueller report, they’re going to ask for the taxes,” Mulvaney said. “If they don’t get what they want in the taxes, they’re going to ask for something else. It doesn’t surprise anybody.” House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal formally asked this past week for the IRS to hand over six years of Trump’s personal and business tax returns . Trump later joked that asking for six years could be a sign that Democrats are “giving up” but insisted he has no plans on releasing the documents using the same old excuse he has been uttering since the campaign. “Is that all? Usually it’s 10,” Trump said . “So I guess they’re giving up. No, we’re under audit, despite what people said, and we’re working that out—I’m always under audit, it seems, but I’ve been under audit for many years, because the numbers are big, and I guess when you have a name, you’re audited. But until such time as I’m not under audit, I would not be inclined to do that.” TRUMP on House request for his tax returns:“I'm always under audit, it seems, but I've been under audit for many years because the numbers are big, and I guess when you have a name, you're audited.

In a Saturday night tweet, the freshman lawmaker from New York linked comments by Fox News host Jeanine Pirro to death threats against her colleague Rep. Ilhan Omar. While retweeting a news story about the 55-year-old Donald Trump supporter who was arrested for threatening to kill Omar, Ocasio-Cortez made a reference to Pirro. “Understand when Jeanine Pirro goes on Fox + rallies people to think hijabs are threatening, it leads to this,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote . “Folks who imply we’re ‘bad’ for politics, the party, the country, etc. have no idea the threats we deal w/ because of that kind of language.

Omar wears a hijab, which, according to the Quran 33:59, tells women to cover so they won’t get molested,” Pirro said on March 9 . “Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to Sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?” Fox News criticized Pirro’s words and temporarily pulled her from the air for two weeks .

Suspected rhino poacher trampled by elephants and eaten by lions in South Africa.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/suspected-poacher-trample-elephants-eaten-lions-kruger-park.html,"Kirstjen Nielsen Wasn’t Cruel and Lawless Enough for Trump. That Doesn’t Exonerate Her. A suspected rhino poacher met a grisly demise at Kruger National Park in South Africa last week. He was part of a group of five suspected poachers who entered the park to allegedly kill rhinos but an elephant killed him and he was later “devoured” by a pride of lions, according to park officials. The family of the alleged poacher were told that their relative had been killed by an elephant and they requested the assistance of park officials to recover the remains. “During this search, which was boosted with a further compliment of Field Rangers, the remains of a body were discovered,” South African National Parks said in a news release published Friday . “Indications found at the scene suggested that a pride of lions had devoured the remains leaving only a human skull and a pair of pants. Skukuza police were notified immediately and are currently busy with further investigations into the incident.” The four other suspected poachers have been arrested. A police officer told local news website TimesLive that the men had gone poaching in the park on April 1, “when suddenly an elephant attacked” and killed one member of their party. Members of his party then said they carried his body to the road “so that passers-by could find it in the morning” before they left the park. They then informed the dead man’s family about what happened and the family called park officials. “Entering Kruger National Park illegally and on foot is not wise, it holds many dangers and this incident is evidence of that. It is very sad to see the daughters of the diseased mourning the loss of their father, and worse still, only being able to recover very little of his remains,” said Glenn Phillips, the park’s managing executive. Kruger National Park is a hotbed for poachers. Of the 680 arrests involving poaching and trafficking charges in 2016, 417 took place in and around Kruger, according to CNN . This is hardly the first time suspected poachers were killed by animals. Last July, as many as three suspected poachers in South Africa were killed by lions . Support our journalism

Reds-Pirates Kerfuffle results in an image of real artistic merit.,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/reds-pirates-kerfuffle-results-in-an-image-of-real-artistic-merit.html,"Texas Tech Put the Spartans in a Safe and Shoved Them Over a Waterfall There are roughly 8,000 games remaining in the regular season, but the Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates already found a reason to engage in a bench-clearing donnybrook. The intra-division hubbub occurred in the top of the fourth inning on Sunday after Pirates pitcher Chris Archer threw behind Reds second baseman Derek Dietrich. Cincinnati manager David Bell challenged the umpire, and the two teams left their dugouts and converged on the field. It was a rather pedestrian affair until Yasiel Puig blew a gasket, and the Reds’ offseason acquisition had to be held back by his teammates. Temps are rising in Pittsburgh after a behind the back pitch on Derek Dietrich who homered earlier in the game. pic.twitter.com/y3dIDCV7Gj — FOX Sports Ohio (@FOXSportsOH) April 7, 2019 Bell, Puig, and Cincinnati pitcher Amir Garrett were tossed from the game, as were the Pirates’ Keone Kela and Felipe Vázquez. Archer was not ejected, even though his pitch started the entire kerfuffle. Dietrich had paused to admire his 436-foot home run in the second inning, and Archer’s throw was a dose of belated retaliation. You’d think two innings would be enough for Archer to cool off, but the man doesn’t take kindly to displays of pride. He’s very Old Testament in this regard, which is appropriate given the dramatic scene that was captured from behind home plate during the ensuing brawl. As a few folks on Twitter pointed out , the striking image looks like an oil painting of an ancient battle. Puig was not backing down today in the Pirates-Reds altercation... pic.twitter.com/WQDfVnd9qg — FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) April 7, 2019 Perhaps it’s the framing that makes the image so inspiring, or the dynamic ketchup vs. mustard palette. Maybe it’s the Pirates’ dorky throwback hats that put it over the edge? Either way, it’s a breathtaking tableau worthy of the Rijksmuseum. The Pirates won, 7–5, but the afternoon’s real winners are art lovers everywhere.

Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu vows to annex West Bank settlements if re-elected.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/benjamin-netanyahu-annex-west-bank-settlements.html,"Kirstjen Nielsen Wasn’t Cruel and Lawless Enough for Trump. That Doesn’t Exonerate Her. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has upped the stakes in the run-up to a critical election Tuesday, vowing to annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank if he is re-elected to a fourth consecutive term . Netanyahu laid out the position that could very well mark the end to a two-state solution with the Palestinians as he continues to struggle to get right-wing voters excited about the election. Netanyahu made the announcement during an interview on Israeli TV when a reporter asked why he had not extended Israeli sovereignty to the large settlements in the West Bank. “You are asking whether we are moving on to the next stage—the answer is yes, we will move to the next phase to extend Israeli sovereignty,” he said. “I will impose sovereignty, but I will not distinguish between settlement blocs and isolated settlements.” Netanyahu went on to say that the government has “a responsibility” for the Israelis who live there. “I won’t uproot anyone and I won’t place them under Palestinian sovereignty. I’ll look out for everyone,” he said. Some 2.8 million Palestinians and 400,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank . Netanyahu’s last-minute election promise is just the latest reflection of how the vote on Tuesday has really become a referendum on the prime minister . If he wins, he will become the longest-serving Israeli prime minister but a loss would likely mark the end of his career. For now, the race is too close to call as Netanyahu battles for the top spot against Benny Gantz of the new Blue and White party. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki basted Netanyahu for his electoral promise. “If Netanyahu wants to declare Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, then you know he has to face a real problem, the presence of 4.5 million Palestinians, what to do with them,” Malki told the Associated Press . The number of Palestinians Malki cited appeared to refer to the total Palestinian population of the occupied West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Malki also accused the United States of encouraging the prime minister by recognizing both Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and the 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights. The Guardian’s Simon Tisdall also notes that President Donald Trump likely played some sort of role in the decision. “His personal inclinations aside, it is unlikely Netanyahu would have floated so potentially disruptive an idea without a nod and a wink from Donald Trump,” Tisdall writes . “In the past, when Netanyahu claimed to have US backing for annexing West Bank territory containing the major Israeli settlement blocs, the White House publicly disavowed him.” The Los Angeles Times editorial board notes that it “is hard to overstate how terrible a proposal this is,” adding that if Netanyahu does win re-election “the best that can be hoped for is that he won’t keep this dangerous and irresponsible campaign promise.” Even if he doesn’t go through with it though, “the very idea of annexation will rouse new Palestinian fury, as well as international condemnation,” writes the BBC’s Sebastian Usher .

It also comes as Trump continues to insist he could go through with his long-standing threat to close the southern border with Mexico. Nielsen’s resignation came mere days after Trump pulled the nomination of Ron Vitiello to head up the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying he wanted to go in a “tougher direction,” a move that many pointed out came at the behest of Miller. “We’re going in a little different direction. Ron’s a good man but we’re going in a tougher direction. We want to go in a tougher direction,” Trump told reporters Friday. Trump reportedly made up his mind after Miller told him that Vitiello wasn’t fully on board with the idea of closing down the southern border . Support our journalism

A Notre Dame star's missed free throw gives Baylor the title.,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/arike-ogunbowales-notre-dame-baylor-ncaa-title.html,"Texas Tech Put the Spartans in a Safe and Shoved Them Over a Waterfall Last year, Arike Ogunbowale was the hero. The Notre Dame guard hit a leaning 3-pointer against Mississippi State to enshrine herself in tournament history and win the NCAA title. It was an absurdly difficult shot, the kind you’d remember for years if you made it in an empty gym, let alone during the biggest game of your life. So when Ogunbowale stepped to the line on Sunday against Baylor, the task at hand seemed pretty straightforward by her standards: Hit both free throws, and send the title game to overtime. After she missed the first attempt, Ogunbowale appeared calmer than anyone else in the arena. She communicated with the bench that she was going to intentionally miss the second one and give the Irish a chance to rebound and score. There was a solution to this problem, just as there was last year against Mississippi State. But this pragmatic thinking was undone by an accident: At the worst possible moment, Ogunbowale couldn’t miss. Her swish put the score at 82-81 with 2 seconds remaining, and Baylor completed a simple inbounds to win its first NCAA title since 2012. After the final whistle, Ogunbowale left the court in tears. Arike Ogunbowale wipes away tears as she walks off the floor.After being the hero in this game one year ago, Ogunbowale missed a free throw with under 2 seconds to play that could have sent the title game into OT. pic.twitter.com/UrKB6MgNbN — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) April 8, 2019 That someone who’s already achieved career-defining glory can still feel this kind of pain is evidence of the fact that, in sports, everything is fleeting. It’s also a reminder for us normal people that, even though we can’t console ourselves with fresh memories of buzzer-beating heroics, losing still feels terrible no matter what. Notre Dame would have liked its chances in overtime. The Irish overcame a 17-point deficit to take a late lead, and momentum was on their side. Star Baylor forward Lauren Cox had left the game with a serious-looking leg injury in the third quarter, and the title was there for the taking. “When you lose a big time player in the middle of national championship game, you’re not supposed to win,” Baylor head coach Kim Mulkey said afterwards. Were it not for Chloe Jackson, she would have been right. The Baylor guard scored two huge baskets in the final 35 seconds, including the go-ahead layup. Lady Bears lead by ✌️ — NCAA WBB (@ncaawbb) April 8, 2019 Jackson scored 26 points and was named the title game’s most outstanding player. She had never even played point guard before transferring to Baylor this offseason, but Jackson somehow managed to learn the game’s most demanding position in time to be a hero on the biggest possible stage. A lot can happen in a year."

How Illinois lobbyist David Piccioli got a full pension for one day of substitute teaching.,slate.com,Aaron Mak,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/illinois-pension-substitute-teacher-david-piccioli.html,"How Does Rubber Keep Getting Into Chicken Nuggets? The Illinois Supreme Court ruled last week that a lobbyist for a teachers’ union was entitled to a public pension, potentially worth more than $1 million over his lifetime, after working just one day as a substitute for a middle school history class. How was that possible? Could anyone go work as a substitute teacher for a day in Illinois and get a pension? No. David Piccioli, a lobbyist for the Illinois Federation of Teachers, took advantage of a very specific set of circumstances, which is partly why the Legislature tried—and failed—to negate his pension. The scheme started in October 2006, when a state House staff member asked Steven Preckwinkle, a director at the IFT, whether the union would be interested in supporting a bill about retirement funds. A stipulation tucked into the legislation allowed people to count their years as union employees toward a teacher’s pension. As long as those private union employees had a teaching certificate, worked in a classroom, and paid contributions before the bill was signed into law, they would be entitled to the public pension. The IFT ultimately decided to back the bill, and Preckwinkle notified approximately 40 employees, including Piccioli, in November of that year that they had only a few months to become eligible before the bill signing. Piccioli, who appears to have been the only person to fully pursue the opportunity, then worked for one day in December as a substitute and obtained his teaching certificate. He also paid $192,668 to cover the contributions. Two months later, Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who had received a reelection endorsement and more than $515,000 from IFT, signed the bill. In 2011, shortly after Blagojevich had been removed from office for trying to sell President Barack Obama’s vacant Senate seat , the Chicago Tribune and WGN-TV uncovered the pension arrangement. Some lawmakers were disturbed by the news and moved to strike out the union-employee stipulation from the pension bill. The state Legislature enacted a law that effectively reduced Piccioli’s pension. He sued, and the state Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the law violated the state constitution, which dictates that established pensions cannot be “diminished or impaired.” (Piccioli was further allowed to keep his prior 401(k) plan with the IFT and a separate pension for his time as a House aide.) Not all the judges on the court agreed with that decision. Three of them joined in a dissent arguing that the pension bill violated the Illinois Constitution’s prohibition against special legislation, which are laws that explicitly apply only to a particular set of constituents. For example, a state law benefiting only people in Chicago would be a clear case of special legislation. The dissenting judges contended that the bill essentially gave pensions to a specific subset of union employees who were able to gain teaching credentials and experience in the narrow, arbitrary window of time between the bill’s passage in the Legislature and signing by the governor. They further pointed out that Preckwinkle even told IFT employees that he would try to delay the bill signing to give them all time to work as a substitute teacher. “Slamming a window shut before it ever opened smacks of special legislation,” the dissent reads. However, special legislation prohibitions have weakened considerably since their heyday in the 19 th century, and it’s rare now to see judges base decisions on them. In this case, the court’s majority decided that while the bill did benefit a particular set of people, setting a deadline for the eligibility window wasn’t arbitrary. The justices also cited the clause in the state constitution stating that pension benefits “shall not be diminished or impaired.” Though many state constitutions have similar clauses, the Illinois Court has been particularly stringent in its interpretation of the protections. In 2016, the Legislature attempted to change the way pensions were calculated. The court struck down the law and essentially ruled that there would need to be a constitutional amendment to make any adjustments. Since Piccioli was the only union official to take advantage of the pension bill, the decision is unlikely to have a broad impact. Yet the unusual facts of the case have further inflamed debates over the state’s pension system, which is more than $130 billion in debt. Some, like the editorial board of the Chicago Tribune , argue that the state Supreme Court’s strict reading of the state constitution’s pension clause has repeatedly allowed people to exploit loopholes. The Legislature could change the clause to relieve the strain on the system, but any amendment to the state constitution requires three-fifths of the members in the House and Senate to vote in favor, as well as a public referendum.

Becky Lynch’s win at WrestleMania 35 gave pro wrestling fans what they want.,slate.com,Christina Cauterucci,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/becky-lynch-wrestlemania-35-ronda-rousey.html,"Reds-Pirates Kerfuffle Results in Five Ejections, One Inspiring Image Professional wrestling achieved what some fans are calling a major milestone this weekend, as World Wrestling Entertainment featured women in the main event of its flagship WrestleMania show for the first time. Becky Lynch, an Irish wrestler who calls herself “the Man,” was Sunday night’s big winner , defeating pro wrestling scion Charlotte Flair and mixed martial arts star Ronda Rousey to take home a pair of wall-size championship belts . Lynch’s nickname points to the strange gender politics of the WWE. A few female wrestlers, like the groundbreaking superstar Chyna, have been pitted against men as equal competitors. More often, women have mostly functioned as sexy palate cleansers between the men’s fights. In pushup bras and fishnets, cheek-exposing underwear and long flowing hair, female wrestlers have been billed as “Divas” by the company. Male wrestlers are treated as sex objects too, with glistening curves and flowing hair of their own. And both genders are cast in stories that emphasize the kinds of personal grudges and revenge fantasies that parse as “catfighting” in women-only matches. But traditionally, the men have monopolized the narratives of domination and power—the kinds of plots male viewers want to identify with.

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. Lynch, aka the Man, has explicitly tried to insert herself into those masculinized narratives. At first glance, the moniker is a ham-fisted attempt at hot-wiring a sexist compliment (“she fights like a man”) to suit a female competitor. If male fans had a hard time imagining a woman as a ferocious, all-powerful headliner, Lynch and wrestling executives may have thought, placing her ascendance in the context of male achievement could help her along. But there’s a bit more going on here. Lynch has said she took the nickname from the catchphrase “ to be the man, you gotta beat the man ,” the signature line of legend Ric Flair, whose daughter Lynch bested on Sunday. Lynch wasn’t just claiming she’s as good as a man (and thus better than all the women). She was using Charlotte Flair’s dad’s slogan against her. Per the WWE’s pre-fight storyline, Flair and Lynch were close friends until Lynch turned against her last summer. “The [WWE] expectation seemed to be that the crowd would embrace Flair and be disgusted by Lynch’s tactics,” wrote Mel columnist Dave Schilling last year. Instead, viewers got into Lynch’s newfound aggression. The formerly “bubbly” wrestler said in a recent interview that taking losses with a smile didn’t win her any fans or convince the WWE writers to give her top billing. “When I came back with a scowl on my face, it got me everywhere,” she said. “I’m sick of not being given opportunities to speak, to say what I feel and say what I think.” In the most common telling, the unexpected enthusiasm for Lynch forced the WWE to give her the slot at WrestleMania, and to give her the win. It’s hard to listen to Lynch’s storyline and track her rise in popularity without thinking about the political and cultural landscape outside the WWE . That’s the weird thing about professional wrestling: As a culture product, it both tells its fans what they need and responds to what they want. Lynch’s quick evolution from bubbly loser to brutish champ is the culmination of years of effort to make the WWE seem less sexist than it is, or has been in the past. In 2015, some WWE viewers complained about the sidelining of women, using the hashtag #GiveDivasAChance after female wrestlers got just 30 seconds of fight time in a three-hour special. The company responded by launching a PR campaign that hyped a “Women’s Revolution,” staging its first all-women’s pay-per-view show last fall, and signing Rousey, an Olympic medalist who’s famous for her UFC domination. The women still wear fake eyelashes and cleavage-bearing clothes unsuited for sports, sure, but they’re getting a bit more institutional respect. It’s hard to listen to Lynch’s storyline and track her rise in popularity without thinking about the political and cultural landscape outside the WWE. In a zeitgeist defined in large part by women’s rage , a woman who shed her likable image to angrily demand what she felt she was owed has become the breakout star of a male-dominated entertainment venue. Schilling chalks up Lynch’s success to the ways she’s made herself appealing to male viewers—not as a sex symbol, but as an aspirational figure. “Her feelings of resentment, frustration and determination resonated” with these men, he writes; when she struck a victorious pose with a face covered in blood after a match last fall, she “signaled to the primarily male audience that she could hang, that she was worthy.” A cynical takeaway would be that male wrestling fans might only get behind a female champion if she remakes herself as “the Man.” An optimistic one would be that the WWE now has more incentive to stop having female wrestlers blow kisses in advertisements and to start giving them more starring roles. (The show Lynch, Flair, and Rousey headlined on Sunday was the second-highest-grossing event in WrestleMania’s 35-year history.) Whichever way you see it, the WWE is pressing Lynch’s superstardom as a feminist victory—she’s “living proof that anything is possible,” according to the title of a post-match video published on Sunday, in which a skimpily dressed WWE employee tells Lynch that “there were a lot of girls [in the arena] that you impacted.” But it’s probably best understood as a smart marketing decision. As Yahoo’s WWE writer put it , Lynch’s rise is “wrestling’s hottest angle in years.”"
"Stop worrying about Candida auris, the super fungus from that NYT story.",slate.com,Susan Matthews,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/slug-nyt-candida-auris-drug-resistant-super-fungus.html,"We Should Use This Proven Public Health Strategy to Encourage Vaccination Is fungus something that you should spend significant brain space worrying about? After the New York Times published an excellent and meticulously researched and reported story about the growing threat of a drug-resistant yeast called Candida auris this past weekend, a lot more people might be considering adding it to the list. The story is full of scary examples of people who’ve been infected and scary stats about how deadly the fungus is—basically, half of the people who get it seem to die, though it’s not clear if that’s from the fungus itself or from other factors. Seems worrisome! The reality, though, is that you don’t have to freak out about the fungus. As the Times story makes enormously clear, there are plenty of people who are currently freaking out about it for you. The piece painted a vivid picture of just how vexing this drug-resistant fungus has been to medical professionals across the globe: They don’t understand what has caused its rise, they don’t have a terribly effective treatment for it, and they don’t even really know how to scrub it out of hospital rooms once it’s gotten in. Reporters Matt Richtel and Andrew Jacobs start their tale with the story of a C. auris case discovered in an elderly man at Mount Sinai Hospital in Brooklyn that makes that last problem unnervingly clear:
The man at Mount Sinai died after 90 days in the hospital, but C. auris did not. Tests showed it was everywhere in his room, so invasive that the hospital needed special cleaning equipment and had to rip out some of the ceiling and floor tiles to eradicate it.
“Everything was positive — the walls, the bed, the doors, the curtains, the phones, the sink, the whiteboard, the poles, the pump,” said Dr. Scott Lorin, the hospital’s president. “The mattress, the bed rails, the canister holes, the window shades, the ceiling, everything in the room was positive.” The fact that the only way to eradicate a deadly pathogen from this hospital room was via ripping out ceiling and floor tiles sure sounds alarming. And then, perhaps even more alarmingly, about a third of the way through the piece, we get to a subheadline that reads: “ ‘No need’ to tell the public.“ Here, Richtel and Jacobs explain the complicated situations in which many hospitals have found themselves as they’ve tried to navigate C. auris outbreaks. As the subhed implies, hospitals have largely decided not to issue public-facing statements about what’s happening. “It’s hard enough with these organisms for health care providers to wrap their heads around it,” said Dr. Anna Yaffee, a former outbreak investigator for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “It’s really impossible to message to the public.” And yet, here we are, in the middle of a Times story, where the threat of Candida auris is most certainly being messaged to the public via the paper of record. Again, that piece is great journalism—the portrait it draws is thorough and complex. But as a means of risk communication, the piece has a murkier takeaway—it’s tough for readers to understand just what, exactly, the news means for them. And that’s even before taking into account that the story itself became news, getting picked up and reblogged with great alarm : “ We Should All Probably Freak Out About this Deadly, Drug-Resistant Fungus ,” wrote Jezebel. “ Candida auris: These alarming CDC maps show where the mysterious fungus is spreading ,” wrote Fast Company. You’d probably be an outlier not to feel a least a bit alarmed after reading through all of this. This is a perpetual problem in health reporting. It’s very hard to bridge the divide between the personal and the global (and maybe not even journalists’ jobs!). Indeed, the problem we the media face when we write headlines about stuff like this new fungus is closely related to the problem hospitals face as they decide whether or not to release a public-facing statement about experiencing an outbreak: The fungus is a very legitimate public health issue, but for almost everyone in the world, it will not be a personal health issue . That is to say, your own actual risk of being harmed by this fungus is extremely, extremely, extremely low. (Being immunocompromised increases one’s risk, but the absolute numbers on infection rates are still very low.) And yet, the disease is a big deal, because in comparison to other outbreaks, it’s growing relatively quickly and doctors don’t know what to do about it yet. You’d probably be an outlier not to feel a least a bit alarmed after reading through all of this. Which means that it’s extremely worthy of news coverage. Stories like this can help public health advocates in making their case for increasing research attention and funding. As Maryn McKenna wrote in a good Wired story on the fungus in the summer of 2018—and as the researchers who spoke with the Times clearly also feel—such support is likely to provide our best path toward triumphing over C. auris. That more research and money is the solution underscores exactly why public health officials likely decided not to put out public notices about which hospitals were dealing with infection. It’s not because they’re trying to hide reality from anyone (they’re diligently reporting cases to the CDC), but because it simply wouldn’t do much good. The action items when it comes to C. auris are on the public health side, not so much on the individual consumer side, which helps explain why numerous hospitals have all landed on the side of not releasing statements about outbreaks and have instead opted to deal with it internally. A patient advocate that the Times quotes and a Forbes contributor writing in reaction to the Times’ story both deployed the same analogy in arguing that the lack of disclosure is a bad thing: Each likened the decision not to announce the disease to a restaurant not saying publicly that it’s had a food poisoning outbreak. But hospitals aren’t restaurants in that most people end up there out of necessity, not because they’re hungry for a pizza. The danger of hospitals broadcasting these outbreaks might be to make people who need immediate medical attention—and who face relatively little risk of infection—fearful to get that help. The public benefit for the smaller number of people going in for elective surgery who might have canceled their procedures, meanwhile, is relatively minuscule, if it exists at all. Again, this hits up against the same problem—the problem of personal health risk versus population-level health risk, and how we calculate and communicate those things. It’s extremely difficult to be clear about both at once because they often seem to contradict each other. It’s also true, in my opinion, that journalism has a higher obligation to population-level risks than individual ones. Individual risk should be conveyed by your doctor or by a member of the actual medical establishment (again, it’s worth considering that in the case of the fungus, medical professionals decided that the individual risk wasn’t worth conveying at all). The population-level concerns should be rigorously covered by the media—this is what allows us to engage in a discussion about what’s important on a policy level, what kind of science and research we should be investing in, and how our world should operate. (The Times story makes perfectly clear that the fungus problem reaches into questions of food production, pesticide use, and more.) With a threat as slow-building as drug resistance, incremental reporting is key. We all want to feel as protected as possible against bad outcomes. No one wants the deadly fungus. But worrying about the fungus won’t help you avoid it. The lesson of this Times story isn’t to panic about your potential fungal infection, it’s to help the people who are worrying about it for everyone get the funding and attention they need."
"Today in Brexit: With May pivoting center, will the EU give her time to strike a new deal?",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/today-in-brexit-may-merkel-macron-eu-extension-labour-deal.html,"How a Lobbyist Got a Full Public Pension for One Day of Substitute Teaching British Prime Minister Theresa May dropped the latest monkey wrench in the U.K.’s already kludgy effort to leave the European Union on Friday by asking Brussels for another deadline extension to leave the bloc, pushing the exit date from this Friday at 11 p.m. to June 30. The request itself signaled a new phase of the Brexit process, one where May appears to have given up on galvanizing the recalcitrant extremes of her own party to reach a compromise, instead turning her attention to the opposition Labour Party to find a way out of the deadlock. With the political ground suddenly shifting after years of inertia, the British prime minister took to social media over the weekend to explain the state of play in the negotiations—and the choice before the country, as she sees it. Let me explain what's happening with Brexit. pic.twitter.com/gjGkvFk8fT — Theresa May (@theresa_may) April 7, 2019 Today in the Friendly Opposition: “Now there’s lots of things on which I disagree with the Labour Party on policy issues,” May said in the video. “But on Brexit there are some things I think we agree on: Ending free movement, ensuring we leave with a good deal, protecting jobs, protecting security.” It’s an extraordinary moment in British politics that the party in power is compelled to reach out to the opposition. May’s Conservative Party, after all, heads a majority coalition in Parliament that could enact whatever kind of Brexit—or any other policy—it wants if its members were all on the same page. The Tories are very much not on the same page, however. With a significant portion of the party in favor of leaving the EU on Friday no matter what, May and the more moderate wing of her party are now looking across the aisle. The Labour Party has spent years on the sideline with essentially no say in the process but is now a potential last resort for the government to cobble together some semblance of a compromise that May couldn’t produce within her own party. The first order of business for May is avoiding a no-deal Brexit, which a U.K. government analysis found could cost the British economy tens of billions. May spent years negotiating an exit deal with Brussels that, in the end, didn’t make anyone happy. To the far right, it doesn’t go far enough in extracting the U.K. from the day-to-day economic and political influence of the EU, while the left largely prefer a far closer economic relationship with the EU after leaving the bloc—or not leaving at all. Today’s Emergency Barnstorming Tour: An emergency summit in Brussels is scheduled for Wednesday, just two days before the deadline for the U.K. to depart. May is trying to buy more time to come up with a domestic solution, but European leaders have been reluctant to just hand over another extension without some semblance of a plan or a change of circumstance, like a national election or another referendum. May is pitching her cross-party talks with Labour as realistic enough to justify a short extension, and she will be barnstorming through Berlin and Paris to try to get German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on board ahead of Wednesday’s summit. Today in Grand Compromises : What does a grand May-Labour compromise look like? It’s too early to tell exactly, but it will likely involve a closer working relationship with the EU in the form of a customs union, which would allow the U.K. economy essentially to stay connected to and operate freely within Europe. This option is particularly odious to the right-wing Brexiteers because it largely binds the U.K. to EU trade rules, and the Brexiteers would like to the U.K. have control over its own rules. Another priority for Labour—after years of having the football pulled back as they raced to kick it—is creating what it calls a “lock” on whatever deal is reached in order to ensure that whoever succeeds May as prime minister can’t simply undo whatever has been agreed to. (May has committed to stepping down as soon as Brexit is complete.) May’s government has described the new talks as “technical” discussions, which seems vaguely positive, all things considered, and both sides are saying cross-party negotiations will continue, as they attempt to come up with an exit strategy that they can convince a majority of parliamentarians to accept—and of course, the rest of Europe to sign off on. Days left until Brexit deadline: 4."

Why We’re Stuck in a Never-Ending Border “Crisis”,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-border-crisis-repeats-itself-again.html,"William Barr Just Dared Jerry Nadler to Go to Court for the Mueller Report Insider reports have now presented a consensus explanation for Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s sudden Saturday resignation: Nielsen, it seems, was forced out because Donald Trump blamed her for the persistence of undocumented border crossings and resented her for not wanting to help him institute potentially illegal measures to stem the flow. Now, you might be asking yourself: Didn’t we just get done with an extended news cycle related to Trump’s impetuous and legally dubious demands for some sort of border-related crackdown? And the answer is yes, the president shut down parts of the government for more than a month this winter because Congress wouldn’t fund his famous wall, then came up with a plan to pay for the wall via a controversial national emergency declaration instead. (That declaration is currently being challenged in court .) Before that, in the summer of 2018, Trump’s administration instituted a family separation policy at the border that caused a nationwide furor before being halted by a judge on due process grounds . And before that , in the first days of his term, Trump instituted a ban on travelers from Muslim-majority countries that was likewise struck down by courts. (A later, more limited revision of the ban was eventually upheld.) If there’s a through line to Trump’s wild, news-overload presidency, it’s this: Sooner or later, whatever his administration says about how it wants to use its time , the president’s attention is going to drift back to the idea that an immigrant group is invading or infiltrating the U.S. The curious thing about this real-life Groundhog Day– but-it’s-not-funny is that it has not been a winning strategy for Trump. The Muslim ban coincided with the early plummeting of his approval rating , which took another dip during the recent wall-motivated shutdown. Family separation polled poorly , and it preceded midterm elections that went badly for Republicans even after Trump sent troops to the border in October in a stunt precipitated by the “migrant caravan.” His emergency declaration actually triggered a significant number of Senate Republicans to vote against him , something we’ve rarely seen during his time in office. If the past is any guide, Trump’s rumored plan to close the El Paso port of entry and separate adults from their children even if they arrive in the U.S. legally will not make him more popular with Republicans in Congress or Americans as a whole. So why does he do it? It seems, given the available reporting, that there are several reasons. One is Stephen Miller—a campaign speechwriter turned senior presidential adviser and one of the only individuals not related to Trump by blood or marriage who’s maintained a top White House role since the inauguration. Miller, who is said to have pushed for Nielsen to leave , is the longest-surviving Rasputin of the more high-profile figures who’ve had their time at Trump’s right hand—Roger Stone, Corey Lewandowski, Paul Manafort, Steve Bannon, and John Kelly among them. The president’s other policy initiatives might have felt disjointed because he can’t retain other staffers for more than six months—but Miller, as my colleague Dahlia Lithwick has observed , has kept himself in Trump’s good graces by staying behind the scenes and maintaining a singular focus on punitive, white nationalist–adjacent immigration policies that speak directly to the president’s political id. That id in turn is maintained and fueled by Fox News, which the president watches all the time and whose most prominent hosts long ago established a business model that depends on perpetually portraying the U.S. as being under attack . At the moment, Fox personalities are literally using their screen time to insist directly to the president that he should respond to Central American immigration by closing ports of entry. Trump also reportedly fixates on immigration because he believes he won the 2016 election by being an inflammatory hard-liner on the issue, leading chants about a border wall at every rally, etc. By his logic, he may have relatively low approval ratings right now, but the polls said he would probably lose in 2016 and he didn’t, so what do the eggheads really know anyway? What’s tricky about that belief is that he’s not necessarily wrong . And while his immigration initiatives have failed to create political momentum and frequently lead to ostensibly embarrassing losses in court—one relatively minor initiative just went down on Monday afternoon —it’s also true that nothing he’s done in office has been so offensive or ineffective as to convince his supporters to abandon him. He’s never fallen far below 40 percent in approval, and even the Republican defections on the national emergency issue were limited enough that the Senate was unable to override Trump’s declaration. Also, media/personnel/strategic issues aside, the president has proven over and over again that he holds racist stereotypes about everyone in the world who isn’t a white European, and Central American migrants aren’t white Europeans. So there’s that. And thus on this issue, as on so many others, we have a situation whose fundamentals will be locked in place until next November’s referendum—and perhaps longer, especially if Democratic candidates don’t ever figure out what their party wants to do about migration .

Another Rando Democrat Announces He’s Running for President,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/california-democratic-congressman-eric-swalwell-running-for-president-somehow.html,"— The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) April 8, 2019 Let’s be honest, the best way to make it on late night TV if you’re super normal is to run for president. On that note, America, I’d like to introduce you to the latest Democratic candidate for president, California Rep. Eric Swalwell! Who? Tell me about it. Let me Google that for you. The 38-year-old former prosecutor was first elected to represent California’s 15 th Congressional District, covering parts of the Bay Area*, in 2012, yada yada yada . You know how to read Wikipedia as well as I do. The likelihood Swalwell sticks around long enough that you—or anyone—gets a chance to vote for him for president is pretty slim. The most compelling thing about Swalwell’s hours-old candidacy is that he’s running with a focus on gun control. There are now so many Democratic candidates we might need to hold a third-tier debate on Bravo.
*Correction, Apr. 9, 2019: An earlier version of this post misstated that Rep. Eric Swalwell’s congressional district covered parts of San Francisco; the 15 th Congressional District covers portions of the Bay Area."
Trump Reportedly Tells Henchman Stephen Miller: You’re “in Charge” of Immigration,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-puts-stephen-miller-in-charge-of-immigration-family-separation-border.html,"How a Lobbyist Got a Full Public Pension for One Day of Substitute Teaching A purge is currently underway in the Department of Homeland Security. In the wake of Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen’s resignation Sunday, a slew of top DHS officials appear headed for the exits as President Trump and his dead-eyed policy adviser Stephen Miller look to ram their immigration priorities through no matter the cost or consequence. It is part of a broader seizure of power by the White House in an effort to implement its noxious—and typically illegal —immigration policies. In fact, Trump is reported to be keen to resurrect the most controversial and amoral of all his anti-immigration ideas—separating families at the border as a means of deterrent. With potential crimes against humanity in the offing, it should surprise no one that the Wall Street Journal reports Trump is handing over the reins on immigration in America to his trusted henchman, Stephen Miller.
An administration official said Mr. Trump recently told Stephen Miller, one of his most hard-line advisers: “You’re in charge” of the administration’s immigration policy… Mr. Miller, the White House adviser, is also pushing to reinstate the [family separation] policy, according to people familiar with the discussions. In recent weeks, he has pushed officials at the Homeland Security and Justice departments to “get in line” with a more aggressive approach to immigration, one of the people said. Administration officials told the Journal that while Miller has always been active in DHS’ immigration-related decisions, Miller has been newly empowered by a president spoiling for a fight on immigration.

Virginia Gives Hope to Humiliated Losers Everywhere,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/virginia-texas-tech-2019-ncaa-title.html,"Reds-Pirates Kerfuffle Results in Five Ejections, One Inspiring Image Virginia and Texas Tech treated basketball fans to a fireworks-packed NCAA title game on Monday night and shed their reputations as defensive party poopers in the process. (And to think some idiots said the game would be bad.) Virginia won in overtime, 85–77, and it capped off a redemption project that started a year ago with one of the most embarrassing losses in college sports history. Last March, the Cavaliers earned the dubious distinction of being the first No. 1 seed in Division I men’s basketball history to lose to a No. 16 seed in the tournament. They were run off the court by UMBC —a chess school!—but they returned to the scene of the crime this year and won the whole dang thing. “ In a way, it’s a painful gift ,” Virginia head coach Tony Bennett said of the UMBC loss on Sunday. “It did draw us nearer to each other as a team.” One hopes this is the start of a trend, where coaches at top programs throw games against McNeese State and Incarnate Word in order to build camaraderie. It would be one thing had Virginia played to type this March and ground its opponents to dust, but the Cavaliers won their title in a most un-Virginia-like fashion. For three straight games (including the title contest), they outgunned their opponents. The trio of desperate, late comebacks began with a miracle overtime win against Purdue, and in the Final Four the Cavaliers managed to keep up with a lightning-fast Auburn team . The slow pace of Bennett’s squads is the stuff of infamy, but Virginia transformed into freewheeling risk-takers when everything was on the line. On Monday, the Cavaliers blew a 10-point second-half lead but forced overtime thanks to De’Andre Hunter’s corner 3-pointer. — NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness) April 9, 2019 Hunter is Virginia’s sure-thing NBA prospect, and he led all scorers in the title game with 27 points. It should be noted that he missed last year’s UMBC loss due to injury, but let’s not let his absence take anything away from the severity of that capitulation. Virginia lost by 20 points to the Retrievers. Had that embarrassment occurred during the time of Edward IV, the entire squad would have been tarred, feathered, and sent to the Tower of London (and that’s just for the sin of wearing shorts). But it occurred in 2018, and so Bennett was allowed to regroup and steamroll through conference play. The real test, though, would come in March, and it nearly got off to the worst start imaginable. Virginia stumbled against Gardner-Webb in the first round, and the feisty No. 16 seed took a 14-point first-half lead. The Cavaliers steadied themselves, and their win was greeted with uncommon relief from a No. 1 seed. Naturally, Bennett was asked about UMBC after the Gardner-Webb game. “ That will always be part of our story ,” he said. “I understand that. And I’m sure a lot of people thought it was gonna be part of our story a second year in a row. But it’s just now—this is a new year. This is trying to be in the moment.” Bennett has an anomalous demeanor for a college basketball coach. While his peers are often red-faced Howard Beale types, he maintains a tranquil presence on the sideline. This is true even when his team looks to be suffering a late-game collapse, as was the case on Monday. But he didn’t falter, and his players followed his lead in overtime, where their pristine execution (17 points!) put the title beyond doubt. “ When the world’s telling you you’re a failure and a loser ,” Bennett said after the title game, “You say, ‘OK, what really matters?’ It drove me. I think, as a staff, we got better.” The way he puts it, losing sounds pretty awesome."

"When You Die, Where Should We Upload Your Brain?",slate.com,Rose Eveleth,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/forms-from-future-death-health-care-robots-mind-uploading.html,"What Kinds of Bureaucracy Will We Be Complaining About in the Future? This article is part of Forms From the Future , a series in which Rose Eveleth imagines the bureaucratic paperwork of tomorrow and what it says about our impending realities. Read more here . Though the future often feels unknowable, there’s at least one certainty that awaits us: death. But while death is inevitable (despite what hawkish hypercapitalists like Dave Asprey claim as they try to sell you things ), that doesn’t mean the gory details won’t change in the future. Today, there are a few ways you can officially state how you want to be treated in an emergency medical situation or if you die. Advance directives offer a more general picture of your end-of-life wishes. A physician order for life-sustaining treatment form is a bit more specific and more common among people with terminal illnesses. These forms vary by state, but they all generally circle around the same questions: What kind of medical care do you want in an emergency situation? Do you want a feeding tube? Are you OK with intubation, cardioversion, antibiotics, IV fluids, and CPR? Or do you simply want something to relieve suffering? In the future, these forms will probably get even more detailed and complicated, as new forms of medicine arise. Already, doctors are using algorithms to guide their medical decision-making . In the future, experts predict, artificial intelligence could do everything from spot cancer to determine exactly when you’ll die . Right now, robots are mostly confined to the operating room , where they are still driven by human doctors doing delicate operations like laparoscopic surgeries. But some think that they’ll make their way into examination rooms and even help doctors triage people as they come in . Nurse robots that assist in the care of the elderly , deliver medication , or show a human doctor on a screen are already in hospitals in both Japan and the United States . Not everyone welcomes these kinds of algorithmic interventions, though. When robotic surgery entered hospitals in the United States 20 years ago, doctors and ethicists spilled a lot of ink pondering what informed consent really meant when it came to being sliced open by a robot . Patients have the option to decline robotic surgery, and it is reasonable to assume that in the future they’ll be able to reject other treatments administered or assisted by robots. (It’s less clear whether such consent will extend to the algorithms doctors use to make decisions like whether to operate. Today that’s not something people have to agree to, but it’s possible that could change with a well-timed lawsuit.) The family of a man in San Francisco was not happy that it was a robotic aid (projecting a human doctor on a screen) that told Ernest Quintana he was going to die. “If you’re coming to tell us normal news, that’s fine,” his daughter Catherine told Sky News . “But if you’re coming to tell us there’s no lung left and we want to put you on a morphine drip until you die, it should be done by a human being and not a machine.” Maybe you’ll be able to opt out of remote communication by a doctor in the future. Should we turn off your livestreaming app while you’re being treated? The digital conditions of our deaths might change, too. If you believe one set of technological prognosticators, we’ll all eventually walk around livestreaming our whole lives. Some people already do . But do you want the details of your death streamed as well—all the way down to the poor EMT giving CPR trying to save you? And then there’s the further-off prediction of mind copying—the idea that one day you might actually be able to upload your brain to a server and live forever in digital form . Should that ever be the case ( and experts think it’s unlikely , but that won’t stop someone from trying to sell people on everything from cryonics to fresh brain–uploading startups ), your server information will be critical to those around you when you die. Our future death-related forms will likely reflect these complications. Are you OK with being treated by a robotic EMT? Can we use 3D-printed organs to replace ones you might have damaged? Should we turn off your livestreaming app while you’re being treated? If you’re going to die, do you want a human to deliver that news? Or is a robot just fine? Where should doctors upload your brain if they’re unable to save you, and what’s the password to access that storage system? The form below imagines what this bureaucratic process might look like.

Is outsourcing domestic tasks delaying millennial adulthood?,slate.com,Rachelle Hampton,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/millennial-adulthood-outsourcing-gig-economy.html,"Another day, another personal essay frustratingly framed as a sweeping diagnosis of What’s Wrong With Millennials . Today’s entry into that viral pantheon attempts to answer whether millennials are outsourcing their adulthoods. Maureen O’Connor writes persuasively that “we are living at a time of unprecedented convenience. Any chore can be outsourced. FlyCleaners for laundry, Uber for driving, TaskRabbit for, well, anything. … And if you don’t know what you want from the world, you can outsource decision-making, too.” Meal kit services like HelloFresh and clothing subscription boxes like Stitch Fix theoretically remove the need to make Big Adult Decisions like what’s for dinner or which new trendy skirt to pick. But if millennials are outsourcing the markers of adulthood that we pantomimed when we played house as children, O’Connor asks—if “adulting” skills like fixing a leaky sink or changing a tire “become optional or outright eccentric”—then what are the new benchmarks of adulthood? Enter the next millennial truism: that careerism defines us and that, as we forgo grocery shopping or buying a house, our markers of progress through life are mostly work- or money-related. To O’Connor’s peers, adulthood is “as much about self-sufficiency as self-direction,” self-sufficiency being defined not as doing your own chores, but as “earning enough to abandon your roommates, afford travel, pay off student loans, or avoid credit-card debt … in the name of feeling free.” It’s a seductive thesis, and, speaking as someone who spends too much money on GrubHub and too much time thinking about work, I see a certain amount of truthiness in it. But it’s also a conclusion that, like most attempts to describe the motivations of 71 million people, doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. O’Connor cites people like Kylie Jenner (of the i nfamous single carrot order) and her own friend, who was willing to pay $50 for the delivery of a burrito during a rainstorm, as proof that “there is a strange and perhaps unnatural comfort when no material object is unavailable, if you’re willing to fork over enough cash.” Millennials as a generation theoretically avail themselves of that comfort on a regular and consistent basis, to the point that outsourcing is the default and choosing inconvenience is a statement. With an app for every chore we don’t want to do, we are now apparently delaying or discarding the part of adulthood that demands we take up the task of clothing and feeding ourselves, thus redefining what exactly adulthood entails. But consider for a moment what O’Connor is positing: A generation that is uniquely ( and empirically ) burdened by student loan debt and stagnating wages is simultaneously one that is uniformly willing to spend $30 to Postmates an onion. The proof: Her friends have done it. That perhaps she has self-selected into a group of peers that is not only willing but has the ability to fork over that cash is not considered, nor is the fact that most people actually don’t have the means to act like this. O’Connor also forgets that outsourcing chores is hardly a new phenomenon. For centuries, the wealthy and middle class have outsourced their domestic labor to hired help, who did everything from rearing children to meal planning to picking up the toilet paper that we can now order on Amazon. Until the mid-20 th century, domestic service was the largest category of women’s paid labor. Now maids and housekeeping cleaners account for less than 1 percent of the total workforce —a fairly dramatic decline that partially accounts for why middle-class families feel more pressed for time than their predecessors. TaskRabbit and Seamless and Hello Fresh are basically substitutions for the domestic service that the middle class relied on until fairly recently. Now, rather than have live-in help, many of us contract out for those services through a third-party app. Of course, it’s uncomfortable to think about the fact that millions of us have apps on our phone that allow us to call a servant on demand, but that’s the reality of the situation. The mistake O’Connor makes is assuming that it’s a new situation, when it’s really just dividing, automating, and scaling up a system that already existed. Rather than have two or three maids you work with for years, now you can have a faceless array of couriers perform menial tasks. In some ways, that’s made domestic help more accessible. In others, it’s turned the people who do this work into nameless automatons who perform one task and then leave, never to be seen again. For O’Connor’s idea that outsourcing labor constitutes a delaying or reconfiguring of adulthood to bear out, it would mean that the wealthy who have never done their own chores are eternal children. Which, maybe! But that’s not the argument she seems to be making. Rather, it’s that, “if ‘adulting’ describes the things adults do, then ‘adulting’ now includes ordering GrubHub to your desk at WeWork while waiting for Amazon to deliver dental floss, which you will use while washing your face with whatever Birchbox sent this month.” And sure, that describes some adults. The problem with O’Connor’s essay—and with this entire genre of personal-essay-as-millennial-diagnosis pieces—is not that it’s not worthwhile to describe those adults. The problem is that in presenting those adults as avatars of a generation, it neglects whole swaths of millennials who still buy their groceries and cook dinner because they have to, and it gives the affluent outsourcers more credit for historical novelty than they deserve."
Of Course Racist Commenters Flooded the YouTube Livestream of a Congressional Hearing on White Nationalism,slate.com,Aaron Mak,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/youtube-shuts-down-racist-comments-on-a-livestream-of-a-house-hearing-on-white-nationalism.html,"Scientists Capture First-Ever Photo of a Black Hole Just half an hour in, YouTube disabled the comments section on the livestream of the House Judiciary Committee’s Tuesday hearing on white nationalism and hate crimes after it was overrun by racist trolls. Before the hearing had even started , users began flooding the comments of the House’s official stream with jokes about hate crimes and accusations that Jewish people had engineered the hearing. Some defended white nationalism. The bigoted rhetoric became even more extreme once the witnesses began giving their opening statements. When Eileen Hershenov, a senior vice president for the Anti-Defamation League, gave the first set of remarks, trolls ridiculed her heritage and claimed she was lying under oath. Perhaps the worst comments came when the next witness, Mohammad Abu-Salha, described the pain of losing his two daughters at the hands of a man who had expressed anti-Muslim sentiments online. Trolls spuriously accused Abu-Salha’s family of being terrorists and spun conspiracy theories that he was an actor reading a script written by Jewish people in Hollywood. Others mocked his deceased daughters with Islamophobic epithets and blamed their deaths on him. By the time Alexandria Walden , counsel for free expression and human rights at Google, began telling the committee that hate speech had no place on the company’s platforms, such as YouTube, the comments section for the livestream had been disabled. Comments for livestreams of the hearing by PBS NewsHour and Red Ice TV, a far-right YouTube channel, were also disabled. A YouTube spokesperson provided a comment on the matter: “Hate speech has no place on YouTube. We’ve invested heavily in teams and technology dedicated to removing hateful comments and videos and we take action on them when flagged by our users. Due to the presence of hateful comments, we disabled comments on the livestream of today’s House Judiciary Committee hearing.” New York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, brought up a Washington Post report on the racist YouTube comments later on in the hearing. “This just illustrates part of the problem we’re dealing with,” he said. Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Republican who had previously suggested that people were too quick to label comments as racist, asked Nadler, “Could that be another hate hoax?” Gohmert then said he was just keeping an “open mind.”"
The connection between Jeopardy! and NAQT quiz bowl.,slate.com,Ken Jennings,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/jeopardy-quiz-bowl-connection-ken-jennings.html,"How Joe Rogan’s Hugely Popular Podcast Became an Essential Platform for “Freethinkers” Who Hate the Left In March, 20-game Jeopardy! champ Julia Collins was invited back as one of the six captains in the two-week Jeopardy! “All-Star Games,” the quiz show’s first team tournament ever. As she met her fellow captains and competitors, all multiweek winners on the game show (including me), she was surprised how familiar everyone seemed to be with each other. Back in 2014, when she made her first appearance, “I didn’t know a single person who had ever been on the show,” Julia told me. But this time, she marveled, “everyone else seems to have known each other, either personally or by reputation, for decades.” Why? They shared years of experience on Jeopardy ’s secret farm team: quiz bowl. Of the 18 “All-Stars” in the tourney, all but Julia and two others had played the academic competition known as quiz bowl in high school or college. One particular quiz organization has employed many of those “All-Stars” in the post-collegiate years. Slatereaders may recall that the Scripps National Spelling Bee is often won by a kid with years of practice on the Indian American local spelling bee circuit . In the same way, if you see someone winning big on Jeopardy, odds are they cut their teeth on the high school or college quiz bowl circuit. The modern game of quiz bowl originated with College Bowl, a radio and TV hit of the 1950s and 1960s . On the General Electric–sponsored quiz show, two four-student teams from different colleges would face off answering questions on subjects with a distinctly fusty classroom vibe: Nathaniel Hawthorne, the periodic table, the War of the Austrian Succession. The show went off the air in 1970, but the format lived on for decades on college campuses as a geeky intramural and interscholastic extracurricular. I captained the quiz bowl team at Brigham Young University in the late 1990s, and we would drive and fly around the country a weekend or two every month, playing (untelevised) quiz games in the basements of deserted campus humanities buildings late into the night. It wasn’t long before I started to see people I knew from the quiz bowl world appearing on TV, winning Jeopardy ’s College Tournament or Ben Stein’s money on a regular basis. In 2001, a University of Michigan quiz bowler I knew named Kevin Olmstead won $2.18 million on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, becoming the biggest winner in American game show history up to that time. More than anything else, it was Kevin’s win that inspired me to try out for Jeopardy! myself a couple of years later. Kevin was a founding member of National Academic Quiz Tournaments, an organization formed in 1996 by a handful of veteran quiz bowl players. NAQT has grown from a niche game to a huge player in the quiz-nerd space; last year, it held 979 events and attracted over 25,000 high school and college players. (Full disclosure: I’ve written and edited film, literature, and theology questions for NAQT almost since its founding, and was invited to become an official member in 2002.) As a result, quiz bowl—and NAQT in particular—has become a de facto farm system for the brains you see on Jeopardy! every night. Over the past decade, 51 percent of Jeopardy ’s Teen Tournament contestants and 46 percent of the College Championship players have been NAQT veterans. “We find many of our best younger players have participated in some form of quiz bowl type of competition,” confirms Jeopardy! producer Maggie Speak. Last month’s tourney was a kind of coronation of quiz bowl’s influence on the show. Not only were 15 of the All-Stars ex–quiz bowlers, but two-thirds of “Team Brad” (which went on to win the tournament) were introduced by Alex Trebek as professional quiz bowlers. Larissa Kelly works full-time for NAQT, while her teammate David Madden is a former NAQT player and coach who founded his own quiz competition outfit, the National History Bee, in 2011. Jeopardy, the top-rated quiz show in America for almost two decades, is obviously a higher-profile arena than quiz bowl—and, as David and Larissa and I can attest, it can be a lot more lucrative. The two games are hardly identical. Quiz bowl questions are full paragraphs stuffed with straightforward factual clues meticulously ordered from hard to easy, which rewards the player bold enough to buzz in on the tougher early material. (If you know, for example, that Grover Cleveland personally hanged two murderers during his term as a New York sheriff, you’ll be able to answer long before a player who is waiting to hear a giveaway phrase like “two nonconsecutive terms as U.S. president.”*) Jeopardy! clues, by contrast, are weird, short little haikus, laced with hints, puns, winks, and red herrings. The quiz bowl canon of knowledge is so exhaustive that using it to prepare for Jeopardy! is like training with a medicine ball or a weighted bat. Your average Jeopardy! player takes the stage hoping to see categories and names that they know well, but strong quiz bowlers can be confident that they will have a shot at just about everything on the board. What’s more, they’ll have plenty of practice recalling those facts under pressure. In the All-Stars tourney, I drafted a player named Matt Jackson as much for his quiz bowl résumé as for his 12 Jeopardy! wins. Watching him hit Daily Doubles, I never had to worry about him not knowing what river drains Cambodia, or which element can be “fixed” in soil by planting legumes, because I knew that all quiz bowl people just know that stuff. (What are the Mekong River and nitrogen, respectively.) Larissa Kelly nailed a very hard clue about Franz Liszt’s Liebesträume because erudite subjects like classical music, which most Jeopardy! players dread, are the bread-and-butter of quiz bowl. As Julia Collins found out, the nexus of quiz bowl and Jeopardy! makes for a tightly knit and even incestuous subculture. NAQT tournaments are staffed by so many Jeopardy! veterans that hotel security has shown up two years running to tamp down what Larissa Kelly described to me as “partly general rowdiness, and partly the loud buzzing noises from the mock Jeopardy! games.” At a recent NAQT nationals, a group of high schoolers was thrilled to spot 2013 Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions winner Colby Burnett and rushed over for a picture. They didn’t realize that the onlooker they drafted to take the photos was 2014 Tournament of Champions winner Ben Ingram. R. Robert Hentzel, the president of NAQT, is uncomfortable with the idea, which he hears sometimes in quiz bowl, that the game’s mission is molding tomorrow’s Jeopardy! brains. “I didn’t want NAQT to be portrayed as just ‘practice for Jeopardy ,’ ” he told me. “That crossed my line of self-respect. Quiz bowl players play because they love learning things, and love hanging out with others who do.” Nevertheless, if you’re a stage mom or dad scheming to land your child a spot on Jeopardy! someday, quiz bowl might just be the magic bullet. 2017 Tournament of Champions winner Buzzy Cohen is starting early: He wants to coach a quiz bowl team at his daughter’s elementary school, and has already enlisted the aid of Julia Collins and Larissa Kelly. “I remember being a kid who was really into knowing stuff, and trivia,” he says. “As an adult, there’s bar trivia or game shows or whatever. But when you’re 11, there’s no outlet for that.” Quiz bowl: molding the Jeopardy! gladiators of tomorrow, one little brainiac at a time.

"Kyle Korver, the 2020 primary, and reparations.",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/kyle-korver-2020-primary-reparations.html,"Texas Tech Medical School Agrees to No Longer Consider Race in Admissions Reparations have become a tricky subject for Democratic politicians. Thanks to (among other factors) the Black Lives Matter movement, Ta-Nehisi Coates’ 2014 “ Case for Reparations ” essay in the Atlantic, and the general focus on American racism occasioned by the backlash against Barack Obama’s presidency, the idea of a racially targeted compensation program—once the domain of radicals and cartoonish comedy sketches —has entered mainstream political conversation and has support among self-identified liberals . At the same time, the idea is broadly unpopular, especially with white voters. (It doesn’t have universal support among black voters, either.) The refrain of the white reparations skeptic is a familiar one: If neither I nor my ancestors owned slaves, why should I have to suffer financially for the crimes of those who did? It’s not a strictly illogical argument, and generally speaking politicians don’t like to spend their time telling potential voters why they should be feeling more of a sense of shame and disgrace. So while some prominent Democrats like Elizabeth Warren have gotten behind at least studying the possibility of a reparations program, many others remain opposed or, like Bernie Sanders, try to avoid getting pinned down on the subject . The trick, politically, would be to make a case for reparations without making white people feel bad. And that is where 2007 NBA free-throw percentage leader Kyle Korver comes in. Korver, a sharp-shooting veteran guard, currently plays for the Utah Jazz. In March, the Jazz banned a white fan from their arena for what the team described as “excessive and derogatory verbal abuse” of Oklahoma City point guard Russell Westbrook, who is black. Korver, who is white, was also teammates with (black) NBA veteran Thabo Sefolosha in 2015 when Sefolosha’s leg was broken while he was being arrested by New York City police officers. The officers claimed Sefolosha had resisted arrest and interfered with their investigation of an altercation involving another player, but a jury acquitted him of all charges and the city subsequently paid $4 million to settle an excessive-force lawsuit he filed against the police. In a new article in the Players Tribune, Korver writes about how those experiences changed his thinking about race—and brings up the subject of reparations in a rhetorically astute way:
Two concepts that I’ve been thinking about a lot lately are guilt and responsibility .
When it comes to racism in America, I think that guilt and responsibility tend to be seen as more or less the same thing. But I’m beginning to understand how there’s a real difference.
As white people, are we guilty of the sins of our forefathers? No, I don’t think so.
But are we responsible for them? Yes, I believe we are.
And I guess I’ve come to realize that when we talk about solutions to systemic racism — police reform, workplace diversity, affirmative action, better access to healthcare, even reparations? It’s not about guilt. It’s not about pointing fingers, or passing blame.
It’s about responsibility. The idea, in other words, is to movethe reparations-related policy conversation away from blame and toward constructive collective action. And while it wasn’t necessarily Korver’s intent to do a favor for the Democratic Party, it seems like this approach would make for a useful way for 2020 candidates to discuss reparations on the campaign trail, where positive, forward-looking imagery can score with voters even when addressing potentially divisive subjects . The framing isn’t original to Korver. Similar language has been used by Duke professor William Darity , who has studied race and inequality for decades. “It’s not a matter of personal guilt, it’s a matter of national responsibility,” Darity said about reparations in a 2018 piece in America magazine. In an email, Darity told me he was “very impressed” by Korver’s piece, calling the guilt/responsibility distinction “critical.” Wrote the professor: “Both victimization and perpetration occur in a context of support for these injustices and atrocities from the legal system and the figures of authority in the society. Therefore, the government is the entity that must shoulder the collective blame, not any individual who may or may not have committed an atrocity. This is a structural problem, not a personal problem.” Darity added that he was “pleasantly surprised” by the extent to which reparations, as well as other “bold” policies like job guarantees and baby bonds, have become part of regular political conversation. In summary, two-time Missouri Valley Conference player of the year Kyle Korver may be fast turning into the 2020 campaign’s most sought-after messaging consultant. Support our journalism

This Has to Be One of the Most Ridiculous Corporate Welfare Deals in Quite Some Time,slate.com,Henry Grabar,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/graceland-memphis-elvis-presley-tax-exemptions.html,"We Need to Admit That the Black Hole Photo Isn’t Very Good The competition for Amazon’s second headquarters brought renewed scrutiny to the corporate welfare deals that cities, counties, and states offer to get companies to pick up and move—or stay put. No enterprise seems too grounded to play the game; treasured “hometown” sports teams are some of the worst offenders. But even cynics might have been surprised to learn, in Sunday’s Wall Street Journal , that Graceland—the iconic Memphis home of Elvis Presley—was ready to decamp, brick by sacred brick, to Nashville, the Middle East, or East Asia after a bruising battle over public subsidy that featured three lawsuits filed against the city and a threat to fund an Elvis-respecting mayor to challenge incumbent Democrat Jim Strickland. “We’ve had substantial offers to take every piece of wood and panel and move it,” Elvis Presley Enterprises head Joel Weinshanker told the paper. City and county officials I spoke to denied that Graceland had ever threatened to leave, and EPE did not respond to my questions. Nevertheless, over the winter Memphis reached a preliminary agreement with EPE, the corporation that runs Graceland and the Presley estate, to give Graceland a bigger cut of city and county property and sales tax revenues for a new expansion project. (EPE is owned by a New York-based brand management company called Authentic Brands Group LLC.) So why, you might ask, is a city that regularly ranks among the nation’s poorest giving several hundred million dollars in tax breaks to a long-dead rock star’s house museum where the cheapest ticket costs $41? The answer illustrates the deep trap American cities have built for themselves by giving corporations of a certain size the expectation of special, negotiated tax deals everywhere they go. Since 2015, local officials have carved out tax exemptions designed to help Memphis’ flagship attraction expand with a hotel, museum, and exhibition facility. (Those exemptions include a state designation called a “tourism development zone,” which allows Graceland to capture much of the sales tax revenue generated on-site, rather than forking it over to the city, county, and state.) Some of the money that Graceland would otherwise have paid as property tax is instead going toward paying off more than $100 million in bonds that a county economic development corporation, EDGE, issued on behalf of Elvis Presley Enterprises. “If we had not invested the money, the project would not have happened,” Reid Dulberger, the president of EDGE, told me on Monday of Graceland’s expansion.* “Let’s be fair: The man passed away in 1977. That’s 42 years ago. At some point, his contemporary fans are no longer coming to visit Graceland. Graceland is dependent on a new generation of fans.” I sort of see his point. When I, a millennial, visited Memphis in 2011, I skipped Graceland—the prices seemed too high for a pop star of fading relevance. Today, a Mansion Only tour is $41, seeing the airplanes is $5 more, and none of that includes “Elvis automobiles, jumpsuits, gold and platinum records and items relating to Elvis’ career.” Those are another $15. But maybe what a new generation wants is conference rooms. Shortly after the museum-hotel expansion was approved in 2015, EPE decided it wanted to do even more: cabins, an RV park; more retail, exhibit, and conference space; new hotel rooms, and plane hangars. Also a 6,200-seat arena and a manufacturing facility, where local workers would be paid $15.50 an hour to make objects like Chia Pets for Graceland’s gift shops. The company and the city came to a preliminary agreement in February that approves those plans and dedicates even more tax revenue to the Graceland master plan, which the company claims will involve $100 million in investment, and includes an agreement to grant $150,000 a year in local community groups for five years. The current package would add up to between $194 million and $269 million in reduced taxes for Graceland, Dulberger said. But he stressed the expansion would not have happened without those incentives, and would be a net gain for the city and county on tax revenue alone. This is the typical logic backing America’s $45 billion–or-so in annual local tax breaks for corporations. It rests on the believability of the corporation’s threats to relocate or not invest at all. In reality, growth often happens one way or another, and corporate welfare does not have a track record of producing great results. But it’s also true that cities have weakened their hands by making subsidies the norm. Which brings us to the reason the February truce may be tentative. The reason Elvis Presley Enterprises has sued Memphis three times over this expansion imbroglio is that it would very much like to build that 6,200-seat arena. But Memphis can’t let EPE do that with public money, because Memphis already used public money to build an arena to lure the Grizzlies from Vancouver, and in doing so promised that the city wouldn’t build an arena for anyone else. Not even Elvis. The city is worried that a taxpayer-funded Graceland Arena would violate its contract with the taxpayer-funded basketball team. It’s a subsidy standoff. The February agreement, one component of which the Memphis City Council may vote on this month, represents a compromise of sorts: It says EPE will spend $12 million on “sound stages,” but takes pains to note there will be no arena at all. An official with the city of Memphis told me there may be storm clouds on the horizon if Elvis Presley Enterprises expects to use those stages for live music. Wikipedia defines a sound stage as “a soundproof, hangar-like structure, building, or room, used for the production of theatrical film-making and television productions.” But the sense at City Hall is that Graceland has not given up on its plans to build a proper concert venue. They can do that if they want—but it’s the one thing the city of Memphis can’t pay for.

Trump and Sisi: The U.S. is helping an Egyptian dictator consolidate power.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-sisi-dictatorship-visit.html,"Mayor Pete’s Stunning Ascent Has Landed Him Right in the Middle of the Democratic Pack Benjamin Netanyahu isn’t the only Middle Eastern leader to visit Washington this spring in search of a Trump endorsement. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi stopped by the White House on Tuesday for a conversation and all-important photo-op with the U.S. president who has praised him in the past as a “fantastic guy.” Trump kept the compliments going Tuesday, saying Sisi is “doing a great job” and “We have never had a better relationship between Egypt and United States than we do right now.” The press availability for the two men in the Oval Office was overshadowed a bit, as everything now seems to be , by Trump’s riffing about border security and accusing Barack Obama of creating the child separation policy, but Sisi still got what he needed. The meeting and warm welcome were a strong message to Egyptians back home—both ordinary citizens and the military commanders who will actually determine whether Sisi gets to keep power—that Egypt’s most important ally is fully behind him. Sisi needs that message to be loud and clear as he pushes through a controversial set of constitutional amendments to consolidate his own power. These include measures to give the president more control over the military and judiciary as well as changes that would extend the presidential term from four to six years and allow Sisi to run for two more terms, meaning he could be in power until 2034, when he is nearly 80 years old. The effective elimination of presidential term limits for Sisi would mark the end of one of the last tangible legal changes still on books from the 2011 revolution that overthrew longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak. It’s as clear a sign as any that Sisi intends to follow in Mubarak’s footsteps, although perhaps with an even greater degree of repression . That’s all fine with Trump and his team, who believe that Obama foolishly abandoned Mubarak and that a strong, autocratic (and, crucially, pro-Israeli) Egyptian government is a boon to regional stability. The Egyptian-brokered cease-fire between Hamas and Israel last month bolstered this view. Sure, all this praise for a dictator is a little hard to square with the Trump team’s talk of democracy and human rights in Iran and Venezuela, but this is not a group that’s been overly concerned with charges of inconsistency. Sisi’s government, though, has been making itself very hard to defend. Many of Sisi’s backers portray him as a defender of secular, modern values against Islamist extremism. Trump praised the Egyptian leader for “moving his country to a more inclusive future” after the opening of the largest cathedral in the Middle East in Cairo in January, and his daughter and adviser Ivanka also commended Egypt for “major reforms aimed at empowering Egyptian women.” But the showpiece cathedral aside, discrimination against Christians and other religious minorities remains rampant . Women who have reported sexual harassment have been arrested and prosecuted . Men arrested for homosexuality are subjected to brutal and humiliating anal exams. The notion that Egypt is a steadfast ally in the fight against terrorism is complicated by a recent report from Human Rights First documenting the scale of radicalization and ISIS recruitment in Egypt’s prisons. “It’s like a fire in a forest,” said one former prisoner quoted in the report. “When you start off with a cell of 200 people, you could have by the end of a year at least 100 of them radicalized. It was happening everywhere I was detained.” The movement that became al-Qaida was born, to a large extent, in Egypt’s brutal prisons , but yet another generation of U.S. policymakers is looking on approvingly as Egypt tries to detain and torture radicalism into submission. This supposedly pro-American government is currently detaining around 20 U.S. citizens, many on farcical charges. Vice President Mike Pence, in fairness, has raised their cases in talks with Sisi , but there’s been nowhere near the level of pressure that was applied to release U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson from Turkey . Undercutting the notion that the country that receives more than $1 billion in U.S. military aid every year is a reliable security partner, U.S. human rights groups have been highlighting a 2015 incident in which Egyptian military Boeing Apache helicopters, provided by the United States, fired on a group of tourists in the Western desert, killing eight*. April Corley, an American survivor of the attack—her Mexican boyfriend was killed—addressed a briefing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday morning, saying, “It’s shocking to me that the U.S. is about to sell another 10 Apaches to Egypt, the very same weapon that attacked our tour group that day. My hope is that President Trump won’t sell new Apaches until Egypt takes responsibility for what it did.” U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy has frozen this sale until the Egyptian government agrees to pay Corley’s medical bill. Leahy was among several members of Congress, all Democrats, who spoke at Tuesday morning’s briefing, sponsored by the Project on Middle East Democracy and a number of other organizations. “An American government committed to human rights would not be welcoming to the White House, an Egyptian general right at the moment when he is about to become a dictator,” said newly elected Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, who was previously the Washington director at Human Rights Watch .* Additionally, a bipartisan group of senators released a letter this week calling on Trump to raise concerns about Egypt’s detention of Americans, arms purchases from Russia, and overall deterioration of human rights during his conversations with Sisi. It’s not entirely absurd that something like this could happen. The Trump administration actually did suspend military aid to Egypt for a brief period in 2017 due to unspecified human rights concerns. Aid was restored last year despite no visible improvements in conditions. For now, Trump seems to be doing his part to make Egypt’s dictatorship permanent.

Today in Brexit: May wins parliament vote for extension request the EU will likely reject.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/today-in-brexit-may-flextension-eu-summit.html,"William Barr Just Dared Jerry Nadler to Go to Court for the Mueller Report It’s a vote she never wanted held in the first place. It’s for a plan that will almost certainly be rendered moot when the EU rejects it Wednesday. And it provides more evidence that her Conservative Party is ripping apart at the seams. But still, Parliament approved one of Theresa May’s Brexit proposals! Good for her. Today’s vote: The House of Commons voted 420–110 in favor of Theresa May’s plan to ask the EU to delay Brexit until June 30. (The currently deadline is April 12, this Friday.) May wants this “short” delay, since anything longer would require Britain to take part in European Union elections. May had to bring this to a vote because of a bill passed last week , requiring her to ask for an extension and giving Parliament the right to approve the date she asked for. Ninety-seven Tory MPs voted against the extension, so May had to rely on the support of the opposition Labour Party and smaller parties. Yet more evidence that, no matter how this week’s high-stakes drama unfolds, the Conservatives are deeply, perhaps irreparably fractured over Brexit. Today in Europe: In addition to the vote in London, May dashed across the continent Tuesday , meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron to convince them to back her delay request. But for all that, the plan is probably dead on arrival. In a letter inviting leaders to Wednesday’s emergency EU leader summit, European Council President Donald Tusk warned that “granting such an extension would increase the risk of a rolling series of short extensions and emergency summits, creating new cliff-edge dates.” In an indictment of the British government’s actions so far, he added that the “experience so far, as well as the deep divisions within the House of Commons, give us little reason to believe that the ratification process can be completed by the end of June.” Today’s buzzword: “ Flextension !” Rather than granting May’s request, Tusk is urging EU leaders to offer a longer extension that “would last only as long as necessary and no longer than one year.” (A draft agreement circulated to EU members ahead of Wednesday’s meeting refers more vaguely to a time period “no longer than XX.XX.XXXX.”) In other words, Brexit could kick in immediately as soon as May is able to win parliamentary approval for the withdrawal agreement that has now been rejected three times. (May is currently attempting to win cross-party support for her deal in cross-party talks with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn but reports have not been encouraging .) A number of European leaders, Macron in particular, have been reluctant to agree to a long extension, fearing the disruptions that could result from letting a U.K. with one foot out the door continue to be a full member in the union, as well as dreading the way the Brexit issue would continue to overshadow everything else on the EU agenda. But it now appears the French are softening their stance a bit . The backlash May has already faced from her own party over sitting down with Corbyn and asking for a delay is likely nothing compared to what she’ll get if it looks like Britain is remaining in the EU for another year. Of course, this is all assuming the other 27 EU countries actually do agree to an extension—short or long—at their summit Wednesday. If they don’t, Britain will crash out of the EU without a deal at 11 p.m. GMT on Friday, an outcome that the IMF warns Tuesday will plunge the British economy into recession under even the mildest scenario. Days until next deadline: XX. (Just kidding, it’s 3.)"

Walters tried to get Mnuchin to commit to two sessions in May before leaving. “This is a new way, and it’s a new day,” she said. “And it’s a new chair, and I have the gavel.” “If this is the way you will treat me, I will rethink” returning, Mnuchin replied.

Magic Leaves the Lakers,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/magic-johnson-quits-president-los-angeles-lakers.html,"Today in Brexit: Theresa May Finally Won a Vote in Parliament—for Something the EU Will Reject Tomorrow Los Angeles Lakers great Magic Johnson announced Tuesday he was leaving his job as Los Angeles Lakers team president just over two years after taking the reins to revive an iconic franchise that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2013, the fourth longest dry spell in the NBA. The move to leave the team appeared to come totally out of the blue, as the Laker Hall of Famer addressed the media in an impromptu press conference ahead of the team’s season finale against the Portland Trailblazers. “I want to go back to having fun. I want to go back being who I was before taking on this job,” Magic said getting emotional at times. “I was happier when I wasn’t the president.” Magic told reporters that the public announcement came before he had even told Lakers owner Jeanie Buss. During his remarks, Magic came back to the theme that he had “more fun” outside of his current role, particularly when he “was able to be the big brother or ambassador to everybody.” The Lakers had gotten dinged by the league for Magic’s interactions with league stars that opposing teams said amounted to tampering. During his farewell, Magic repeatedly brought up his frustration with not being able to act as an elder statesman of the game whiles he was in the Lakers front office. “What I didn’t like was the backstabbing and the whispering,” Magic said without elaborating. “I have a great life outside of this. I was like: what am I doing? I’m going to go back to that.” Magic leaves a franchise very much in transition, but still far from a finished winning product. Despite the addition of LeBron James this past offseason, the young team sputtered under the new weight of expectations and failed to make the playoffs. “We’re halfway there with LeBron coming,” Magic said of the team’s progress. “I think this summer with that other star coming this team is really going to be in a position to contend for a championship with the growth of the young players.”"

Forms From the Future: Do you really need a human to do that job?,slate.com,Rose Eveleth,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/forms-from-future-request-a-human.html,"What Kinds of Bureaucracy Will We Be Complaining About in the Future? At many large companies, before you can get a new computer or server or device, you have to fill out a form that tells the company not just why you need the item but who will pay for it and who is responsible for it. But as the sorts of work that humans and machines do collapse down even further, that might change. Let’s say you’re a manager at a big box store or a fast-food franchise or even a hospital . You might also need to fill out paperwork justifying your request for an actual person to pull boxes from a shelf, check people out at a store, deliver medication, or make a hamburger . How long do you think you’ll need this human for, and who is responsible for her safety? Do you really need a human? Or could a machine do the same job for longer and for cheaper? Trying to quantify the projected length of a person’s working life can be traced back to the early 1900s in the United States. Nineteenth-century life insurance companies relied on mortality tables provided by cities and churches to calculate their policies and payouts. In the early 1900s, AT&T became one of the first huge companies to adopt the idea of a “service life” for its machinery—keeping track of things like telephone poles and vehicles and gear and trying to predict when they might fail. Today, the concept of a “service life” for a piece of equipment is commonplace, but at the time it was relatively unusual. “These graphs allowed them to predict the lives of their machinery,” says Dan Bouk, a historian and the author of How Our Days Became Numbered . They meant that the company could replace things before they were run into the ground and failed. Then, in 1927, the opportunity arose to apply the same thinking to people. The late 1920s saw the rise of pensions beyond the military in the United States. Which meant that huge companies like AT&T suddenly had an incentive to predict how much work they were getting out of their employees and how much they might be expected to pay them back once they retired. Just like with their telephone poles, vehicles, and gear, AT&T began collecting data on everything from employment tenure to wages. The company designed tables to better understand its workforce, “which they can use to predict what the service life of their various employees will be,” Bouk says. With this data, it was able to offer retirement to workers who might not have been thinking about it but who the company predicted would no longer provide enough work or efficiency to be worth employing. Today, the conflation of service life and human life is less about pensions and more about mitigating other kinds of financial risks. Gone are the days when many workers spent their entire professional career at a single company. In a world where Amazon has patented (although doesn’t seem to have actually developed) a cage to protect humans from their robotic co-workers , companies looking to get more work for less money (and trouble) are turning to machines that won’t complain or get sick or unionize. Machines usually have a higher upfront cost, but they don’t require health care or safe working conditions. The new calculation goes like this: “How likely is this machine going to be more expensive to maintain in the future compared to how likely is this worker to negotiate for better wages,” Bouk says. In a world where the value of humans has been boiled down to their ability to work, the future of asking for human additions to your office might look a lot like the way you apply for a laptop today. You’ll be asked to justify exactly why you need a human, and perhaps even use the company’s predetermined tables for what the service life of that human worker might be. How many shifts can your checkout human work before you have to provide them with health care? How many burgers can a human fry cook make before it’s statistically likely that they’ll injure themselves on some piece of kitchen equipment? How many times can your warehouse human lift a box? And perhaps your contracts will be determined by that algorithm the same way service life estimates were used to predict when a machine would become obsolete—at the end of your service life, you’re let go from the company, off to find a new job where you have to compete once again with the machines.

On-demand PrEP: Is the 2-1-1 Truvada model safe?,slate.com,Matthew Terrell,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/prep-on-demand-211-truvada-hiv-sex-safety.html,"“Born This Way” Is the Standard Story for Queer People. But for Many of Us, That Story Is a Lie. An Australian man recently made headlines as the seventh reported case, worldwide, of a failure of PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis), the groundbreaking drug regimen shown to be 99 percent effective at preventing HIV infection with daily adherence. While understandably disconcerting for users, PrEP failures are major news because they are so rare—and Truvada (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine), the drug used for PrEP, is unquestionably one of the best tools we have for stopping the spread of HIV. One notable detail of this case is that the individual, Steve Spencer (who is already undetectable and noninfectious with treatment and still an advocate for PrEP ), was following what is known as an “on-demand” version of the regimen. This prescribed schedule is also known as event-driven PrEP, or PrEP 2-1-1. Essentially, when someone knows they are going to have condomless anal sex, they take a double dosage of PrEP between 2–24 hours before the encounter, and then a single pill each over the following two days. Official guidelines in Europe and Australia allow the on-demand approach, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved it. Even so, some American doctors and health centers are already recommending the regimen to gay and bisexual men. While we don’t know the specific circumstances that precipitated Spencer’s seroconversion, it’s fair to ask: Is on-demand PrEP safe? And if so, who should consider using it? To the first question, the short answer is that research shows on-demand PrEP offering significant protection against HIV with proper usage—and it is certainly better than no PrEP at all. But researchers and doctors disagree about whether it matches the effectiveness of the daily pill approach in practice. Interest in on-demand PrEP began to grow in popularity among gay and bi men in the wake of a 2015 European study called IPERGAY . Subjects chosen because they already engaged in unprotected anal sex were told to take PrEP as-needed around sexual encounters on the 2-1-1 dosing schedule. In case of multiple consecutive episodes of sexual intercourse, participants were instructed to take one pill per day until the last instance of sexual intercourse in a given string, and then to take the final two post-exposure pills. Of the 414 subjects in the study, there were 16 cases of new HIV transmission: Two in the group taking PrEP and 14 in the placebo group, suggesting an 86 percent reduction in the incidence of HIV. Vitally, both transmissions in the group taking PrEP had stopped using PrEP many months prior to the time of transmission and were both still sexually active—in other words, they were not protected. Another ongoing study from Europe called Prevenir has found even better results. This study, now in its third year, divides 1,435 subjects into daily and on-demand PrEP use (there is no placebo group) and has thus far found no HIV transmissions in either cohort. This suggests that on-demand PrEP can be as effective as daily PrEP use and has led the study’s authors to conclude that both dosing regimens could be recommended to the public. These studies have led some American PrEP users and prescribers to experiment with the on-demand “disco dosing” schedule. But it’s worth being aware of the nuances of the science before trying it yourself. The original IPERGAY study has been criticized for perceived flaws, and some health advocates fear that doctors and users may be overestimating the efficacy of on-demand dosing. In particular, the major criticism of IPERGAY is that many of the subjects were having sex so often that they were essentially maintaining consistent levels of the drug in their body. The average subject in IPERGAY had five sexual encounters per month, which means on the 2-1-1 schema they took PrEP half the days each month. The question is: Can this data be extrapolated to someone who, say, has sex once per month and doesn’t have any consistent levels of the drug in his body? Statistically speaking, it’s possible. A sub-study presented at the 9th International AIDS Society Conference in 2017 analyzed the original IPERGAY data of subjects who had three or fewer sexual encounters a month, and thus took fewer pills. Because there were no transmissions in this group (remember, the two HIV infections were in subjects who hadn’t taken their PrEP in months), it was concluded that the efficacy rate remained consistent across casual and regular on-demand PrEP users. Combine this with the Prevenir study, which showed no transmissions, and the data points to on-demand PrEP being highly effective. But not all health professionals are rushing to recommend on-demand PrEP to their patients. According to Dr. Antonio Urbina at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, the results of IPERGAY and Prevenir seem to contradict medical understanding of how PrEP interacts with human tissue. But there are studies that assess PrEP users when they have varying levels of the drug in their body. The purpose of these tissue studies is to measure how long PrEP requires, and how many doses of PrEP are necessary, to reach maximal levels of saturation, and thus protection from HIV infection. These studies show it takes much longer than the “up to two hours before a sexual encounter” dosing schedule of on-demand PrEP to reach the safest levels. “To reach [maximal] protective levels of PrEP, you need to take it for one week for anal/rectal sexual encounters, and 21 days for cervical/vaginal sex,” says Urbina. Additionally, there are variables that can influence the effectiveness of on-demand PrEP in ways statistical models can’t take into account. In terms of sex acts, “there are degrees of risk,” says Urbina. “The highest risk is receptive anal sex [bottoming] with ejaculation.” Oral sex or penetrative anal (topping) are less dangerous. Other risk factors include having other sexually transmitted infections, which can put you at greater risk of contracting HIV, receiving semen from someone with a high viral load (i.e., bottoming for someone who just contracted HIV, and doesn’t know it, and is shedding the virus at high levels), or having rough sex that may cause tears in tissues and increase the likelihood of transmission. Beyond specific acts, some sexual situations are inherently riskier, and with those the maximal efficacy rate of daily PrEP taken for a longer period of time would be preferable. For example, if a patient was going into a situation where he might have multiple sexual encounters (possibly with internal ejaculation), like a sex party or gay cruise, Urbina would advise the patient to start PrEP as early as possible as a daily pill, and continue a month after coming back. But even that may not be ideal: Urbina says there still is not enough evidence to support “vacation dosing,” where PrEP is taken during a set period when subjects know they will be having risky sex. This is why Urbina tends to push his patients toward daily adherence to PrEP. “The choreography of of 2-1-1 is hard, because sex is often spontaneous,” he says. “Daily PrEP is preferred because it is good for any surprise sexual encounters you may have.” “But I do like studies of alternative models,” he adds. Indeed, Urbina acknowledges that even if it may not provide optimal protection, there are patients who might benefit from on-demand PrEP. For example, it’s a good option for older patients who may have other medical issues (such as kidney problems) exacerbated by constant PrEP use, but still need protection for a handful of sexual encounters every year. For others the reason may be financial, given that a 30-day supply of the drug runs on the order of $1,500 a month absent any state sponsorship, insurance coverage, or copay assistance . And of course, there are always people who don’t like to take a daily pill, often because they are very sensitive to side effects, but still have risky sexual encounters that merit PrEP. (It’s worth noting that these patients might then repeatedly experience the common start-up side effects of diarrhea and nausea that usually fade after a week of daily use.) For any of these groups, 2-1-1 PrEP is better than nothing. But what about everyone else? While studies of on-demand PrEP suggest it works effectively, there are many variables in the messiness of sex that arguably render it less dependable than the daily approach. For the majority or PrEP users, the safest, most confident approach remains swallowing that one blue pill a day."
New trailer for Disney's Lion King looks like a nature documentary (VIDEO).,slate.com,Marissa Martinelli,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/disney-lion-king-trailer-live-action-cgi.html,"The Title-Deciding Instant Replay Ruling in Monday’s NCAA Final Was Totally Insane The special effects in the new trailer for Disney’s remake of The Lion King are nothing short of dazzling. Every beetle wing, every clod of dirt, every strand of fur is rendered in immaculate detail, raising the question: Are we sure these aren’t just, like, real lions who’ve been trained to sing and dance? At any moment it feels as though David Attenborough will chime in to explain that hakuna matata means “no worries for the rest of your days.” Director Jon Favreau has pulled off this trick before with the hyper-realistic animation of The Jungle Book . But this isn’t The Jungle Book , it’s The Lion King , and there’s no real, human actor playing Mowgli to ground the special effects in reality. Fortunately, the animators make it easy to distinguish between, for example, Scar and Mufasa, even though they’re lacking the expressive faces of their 2D-animated counterparts.

Scientists capture first-ever image of a black hole with the Event Horizon Telescope.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/black-hole-photographed-first-time.html,"Why You Don’t Need to Worry About That New Drug-Resistant Super Fungus In what is being heralded as a momentous and long-awaited development in scientists’ search to understand some of the most mysterious aspects of our universe, astronomers for the first time have captured a photo of a black hole, an international consortium of scientists announced in simultaneous press conferences around the world Wednesday. OK, it’s not exactly a photo of a black hole. As remnants of collapsed stars, black holes are so dense that their gravitational forces prevent all matter and even light from escaping, which means that they cannot themselves be photographed, as they are unseeable . So this photo doesn’t tell astronomers everything they would like to know about the objects. But it does show the halo of super-heated dust and gas that swirls around the black hole at near the speed of light before being sucked in (or, more technically, it shows the effects the black hole’s gravity has on that matter, as the gravity warps the shape of space-time itself, deflecting light and creating a shadow). Beyond producing a cool-looking image, the data will help scientists learn about how gravity and light contort just at the black hole’s edge. According to the Guardian , they have already learned about the nature of the light’s bend just at the black hole’s event horizon—the point after which no light can escape. And the photo appears to confirm some of their understanding as to how the physics would work: The particles on one side of the disk appear brighter because they are being shot in our direction as the disk of gas and dust rotates. This particular black hole is an extremely massive one—it has a mass of about 6.5 billion of our suns.* It sits at the center of the galaxy Messier 87, roughly 55 million light-years away, which means the image is actually of the black hole 55 million years ago. Despite its enormous size, scientists had worried we would not be able to create a telescope powerful enough to see something so far away. The breakthrough came when a group of more than 200 scientists collaborated across eight of the planet’s most powerful radio telescopes, making up the Event Horizon Telescope. They waited for a clear sky to happen simultaneously in all eight locations around the world, syncing up each telescope with absolute precision using atomic clocks and supercomputers, and combining and comparing observations from each different telescope. According to the Guardian, the photo was taken in April 2017, and one reason for the delay was that collaborators in Antarctica had to wait until the end of Antarctic winter to send over their data. The image now represents the strongest evidence yet for the existence of black holes—something first theorized by Albert Einstein (the detection in 2016 of gravitational waves made by two colliding black holes was another particularly exciting piece of evidence). Scientists are hoping that the data taken by the EHT will prove fertile for more discovery. In the meantime, if you’re disappointed by the blurriness of the image, you might not have to wait until the next multi-continent scientific endeavor: According to NBC News , one of the major goals for the group is to use the data to make sharper images.

We need to admit that the black hole photo isn’t very good.,slate.com,Heather Schwedel,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/black-hole-photo-just-isnt-very-good.html,"Stem Cell Therapy Is Being Marketed to Autistic Kids. It Shouldn’t Be. It’s like the universe had a royal baby: That’s how excited everyone is for this first glimpse of a black hole , which astronomers announced Wednesday morning in D.C. The image is based on data from radio telescopes all over the world, so it’s not technically even a picture of a black hole. Black holes are, scientifically speaking, unseeable. So it’s really confusing that everyone’s acting like we have a picture of one. This is actually a composite that shows the shadow of a black hole. This may or may not account for why the black hole looks different from how scientists and Hollywood have previously imagined it: It appears as a blurry circle of fire, not unlike, as Twitter users have pointed out, a bright orange doughnut. Also a hoop earring, the letter O made of neon, a SpaghettiO, the bagel emoji, etc. I mean, it’s a circle—it could be anything! Because of the importance of this achievement—by all accounts, it’s a major breakthrough—the image of the black hole will be practically inescapable in the news and on social media certainly today, and perhaps for the rest of this week.

That blur? Pssh, I’ve seen better. Couldn’t another planet have stood in, like a coin or a pencil, to show scale? I want to join the scientists in their excitement, but folks, this black hole needs a makeover. Maybe it hasn’t found its angles ?

"Wisconsin Supreme Court race: Lisa Neubauer loses to Brian Hagedorn, ensuring Republican dominance.",slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/wisconsin-supreme-court-neubauer-concedes-hagedorn-republican.html,"Today in Brexit: Theresa May Finally Won a Vote in Parliament—for Something the EU Will Reject Tomorrow On Wednesday, progressive Lisa Neubauer conceded last week’s Wisconsin Supreme Court race to Brian Hagedorn, a staunch Republican, ensuring that the state Supreme Court will have an entrenched conservative majority until at least August 2023. The political fallout from this result is hard to overstate: The conservative majority on the state judiciary is likely to rubber-stamp the gerrymandered Republican Legislature’s extreme power grabs while approving gerrymandered maps after next year’s census. This one race essentially guarantees that conservatives will dominate the toss-up state’s politics for years to come, no matter how Wisconsin’s voters actually cast their ballots. Both candidates currently serve on the state appeals court. Hagedorn defeated Neubauer by about 6,000 votes out of 1.2 million cast. Neubauer declined to request a recount. Hagedorn will replace the liberal Justice Shirley Abrahamson, increasing the Republican justices’ majority from 4–3 to 5–2. To win a majority now, Democrats will need to defeat Republican Justice Daniel Kelly in 2020, then oust Republican Chief Justice Patience D. Roggensack in 2023. Neubauer was widely expected to win Abrahamson’s seat easily after Rebecca Dallet, a liberal, won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court by a huge margin in 2018. Her opponent, Hagedorn, lost support after local media reported that he gave paid speeches to the anti-LGBTQ law firm Alliance Defending Freedom as an appeals court judge ; claimed that a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down sodomy laws could lead to the legalization of bestiality; serves on the board of an academy that expels students and fires teachers for being gay; wrote that gay pride month is “homosexual propaganda” that creates “a hostile work environment for Christians”; and labeled Planned Parenthood a “wicked organization.” Hagedorn also represented Scott Walker when the former GOP governor refused to defend a state law granting hospital visitation rights to same-sex couples. In response to this anti-LGBTQ record, the Wisconsin Realtors Association withdrew its endorsement of Hagedorn. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which funnels money to conservative judicial candidates through the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, also pulled its financial backing of his campaign. In the last week of the campaign, however, the Republican State Leadership Committee spent $1.2 million boosting Hagedorn, a late infusion of cash that appears to have pushed him over the top. (The National Democratic Redistricting Committee spent $350,000 supporting Neubauer, though Democratic leaders, including 2020 hopefuls , were almost entirely absent from the campaign.) The race was Wisconsin’s most expensive state Supreme Court election in a decade, with candidates and outside groups spending more than $6 million combined. There are a few obvious consequences of Hagedorn’s victory. Because conservatives will now hold the Wisconsin Supreme Court until at least August 2023, there is little chance that the majority will rein in the GOP-dominated State Assembly. The conservative justices will probably approve legislative Republicans’ 2018 power grab , when lawmakers weakened incoming Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ ability to enact progressive reforms. Moreover, the court will likely allow legislators to create another partisan gerrymander after the 2020 census that entrenches GOP power for the following decade. Evers can veto Republicans’ map, but without Democratic control of either legislative chamber, he will only have so much power to limit GOP dominance. And the current gerrymander ensures that Republicans will maintain their stranglehold on the assembly through the next round of redistricting. Neubauer’s unexpected loss proves, once again, that Republican leaders simply care more about judicial elections than Democrats. After huge victories in Wisconsin’s 2018 races, liberals failed to turn out for Neubauer in sufficient numbers. Their apathy ensured that the Wisconsin Supreme Court will remain in arch-conservative hands for at least four more years."
The wily spammers infiltrating Google Hangouts and Calendar.,slate.com,Jane C. Hu,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/google-hangouts-calendar-cam-girls-spammers-block.html,"How a Futurist Sees AOC’s Video “A Message From the Future” When I looked at my Google Calendar, I realized I had a busy Friday ahead of me: two interviews with sources, a conference call. And then I noticed something surprising: an event scheduled for 4 a.m. to 5 a.m.? I clicked on the event titled “RE,” and in the event details box was a message from Mrs. Sandrine Nzi, who desperately needed my help in donating her late husband’s money to start an orphanage. A noble cause, I’m sure, but I deleted the invite. (Mrs. Nzi, if you’re reading this and you really do want me to manage your funds, please get in touch again. You apparently already know my email.) A couple months later, I started getting spam messages via Google Hangouts. Unlike Mrs. Nzi’s message, these were less wholesome.Leonarda, Dmitriy, Satish, Joana, and Alyce were all cam girls who’d started group chats with several dozen people, inviting us to watch their feeds. These chats popped up in my Gmail window in the middle of the day, sometimes with NSFW photos. Thankfully, I work from home, but I imagine if I did have co-workers, they’d have questions about what I was up to on my screen. The spammers in these chats were persistent; in Leonarda’s, for instance, a user named Jose kept sending links to various cam girls’ Snapchat accounts, one of which included a gay slur. Sometimes, other recipients of the spam chats responded. Jim seemed eager to have gotten attention from a cam girl: “Tell you what Kimberly if you want let’s meet up,” he replied to the other 46 people in the chat. I was desperate to stop the constant pings. But despite my best efforts, I could not figure out how. I tried to leave the chat, but I didn’t see an option to do so, nor did I see a way to just block the spammy account. A Google rep later told me that in each chat’s settings, there is a “leave conversation” option—good news, though it’s confusing why I didn’t see it when I initially received the chat—and explained how to block the spammers. After exchanging several emails with this helpful rep, it appeared that the only way I could block my spammer was to send them a chat invite—not exactly what I wanted.* There was also no way to just block the spammy account. Finally, I found a solution: I removed every other person from one of the chats I was in. To keep it from happening again, I looked into changing my settings for Hangouts invitations. But there was no way to prevent it. If a user has your phone number or email address, Hangouts allows you to choose between two options: They can send you invitations or contact you directly. While there is a setting to block invitations from “everyone else,” a spammer who has your email or number can still send you invites.* Because I am hopelessly dependent on Google products, I tried to Google search my way to a solution. What I found instead were folks on Reddit, Google’s support site, and an Android message board describing the same problems with Hangouts and Calendar. On Quora , a guy named Brad said he even got a call through Hangouts that he suspected was a sexy spammer. These aren’t the only Google products spammers have also exploited to run their schemes: Redditors posted about location sharing requests they received on Google Maps for Android from “You Have Received a Free Prize,” which sounds like the digital equivalent of free candy from an unmarked white van. Luckily, Google’s weeded out that problem: In October, it announced it was disabling Nearby , the feature that enabled these spammy notifications. My Calendar and Hangouts spammers are on the vanguard of an arms race. The hive mind, alas, provided no good solutions to preventing Hangouts spam. But there is a small tweak you can make to mitigate Calendar spam: In your settings, deselect “automatically add events from Gmail to my calendar” so that any spam invitations won’t autopopulate amongst the things you actually have scheduled. Still, that doesn’t stop the spammy messages from appearing in your email inbox. A Google spokesperson told me that the company is “deeply committed to protecting our users from spam across our services,” pointing out that the company has options for users to report spam in Calendar and Maps and to block users on Hangouts . But even Hangouts’ blocking function only works once you’ve accepted chat requests. It won’t stop new spammers’ invitations from popping up. To be fair to Google, spam is not a straightforward problem to solve. It’s done a phenomenal job of relegating business deals from Nigerian princes and extremely wealthy widows to my Gmail spam box while making sure emails with legitimate offers still get to me. Google told me its spam filter has a 99.9 percent accuracy rate, no small feat given how spam prevention is like whack-a-mole. A 2010 paper presented at a spam conference called this a “mutual evolution of spammers and spam filters.” For instance, spammers used to send messages with all text in a photo because filter bots can’t read photos—this is the idea behind CAPTCHA. But then developers wised up to that strategy and blocked all messages their filters couldn’t read. To the casual observer, it seems inconceivable that spam could be worth it. Why put so much effort into something so obviously fake? But it turns out spam’s actually quite profitable. A 2008 study in which researchers sent out their own spam found that the “conversion rate” for penis enlargement ads—that is, the number of people who fall for messages and give spammers their credit card number—was 0.00001 percent. That sounds tiny, but it resulted in $2,731.88 worth of purchases over a month. The researchers estimated that if they’d scaled up the number of bots they used, they could make upward of $9,500 a month. (Lucky for those spammed in this study, they received an error message after clicking on the “checkout” button on the researchers’ fake website.) In some strange way, I admire the forward-thinking spirit of my Calendar and Hangouts spammers. They’re on the vanguard of this arms race. Rather than joining the crowded market of email scammers, I imagine the folks who run Calendar, Hangouts, and Maps bots are seeking out new challenges, with potentially big rewards. Good luck to them, but I’m still not clicking their invites.

The new bipartisan tax-filing bill is a win for TurboTax lobbyists.,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/turbotax-bipartisan-tax-filing-bill-win-for-lobbyists-ron-wyden.html,"We Need to Admit That the Black Hole Photo Isn’t Very Good Policy wonks have long argued that the government could make it radically easier and cheaper for most Americans to complete their tax returns each year by using one neat trick: Just have the IRS fill out the forms for them. Instead of making people slog through the spring ritual of firing up TurboTax or trudging to H&R Block, the feds would send everybody a prewritten return including all of their financial information and what they owe. Taxpayers could then choose to either approve it and go on with their lives or reject the return and complete one themselves. This idea might sound a bit like sci-fi. But many countries —Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Chile, and Spain, among them—already have this system in place. The U.S. could do it too for people with simple tax situations, since the IRS already gets our earning info directly from our employers and banks. (That’s how they check to make sure people aren’t cheating.) In the past, Democrats and Republicans have introduced legislation that would make this kind of free and easy filing system—which would likely save Americans billions of dollars and untold hours of tedium—a reality. But their efforts have been defeated thanks to intense lobbying by a coalition of tax preparation companies, which want to defend their bottom lines, and anti-tax conservative groups, which want to ensure that filing remains as much of a headache as possible. And now, depending on whom you ask, it appears that Congress might be poised to snuff out the dream of bringing Nordic-style, zero-hassle tax filing to the U.S. for good. On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed the Taxpayer First Act , an expansive, bipartisan reform bill designed to modernize different aspects of the IRS. (It was introduced by Rep. John Lewis of Georgia—as in, the civil rights hero.) Its companion in the Senate has backing from both Democrats and Republicans as well. But consumer advocates claim the legislation would effectively ban the IRS from creating any sort of a free online filing system that could compete with software like TurboTax. At least one key Democrat, citing the IRS’s own lawyers, has said that’s not the case, however. Here’s what the controversy—which ProPublica’s Justin Elliott first reported on —is about. Since 2002, the IRS has teamed up with a nonprofit industry group made up of tax software companies to provide a free online filing system for middle and low-income households. It’s called the Free File Program. People are currently eligible if they make less than $66,000. And under the agreement that governs the effort, the IRS isn’t allowed to offer its own competing free service. Currently, the government and the tax prep industry have to re-up their deal every few years. The Taxpayer First Act would effectively write the agreement into permanent law, including the part that bars the IRS from creating an alternative while the Free File program is running. Activist groups—including the National Consumer Law Center, U.S. PIRG, and Consumer Action— have argued that this would not only bar the government from creating its own no-cost product that could compete with the likes of TurboTax, but also prevent the IRS from implementing a return-free, no-sweat system like the ones that exist in Europe. But Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, says that’s not the case. On Wednesday, he announced that the IRS’s chief counsel had told him that the Taxpayer First Act would not preempt the government from developing its own public filing program. Confirmed to me by @IRSnews this morning: IRS has the authority to set up a public program allowing taxpayers to file their returns directly for free. I'll block any legislation that would change that. https://t.co/xn8cTNe35k — Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) April 10, 2019 When I asked Wyden’s staff to explain the IRS’s legal reasoning, I was told that under the current Free File agreement, the government has the right to terminate the program and create its own product, as long as it gives the industry a year’s notice. Since the Taxpayer First Act basically sets the terms of that deal in stone, the IRS believes the government would still have the right to shut the program down. Wyden has a good deal of credibility on this issue: He’s long been an advocate of simplifying tax filing, and he introduced a bipartisan bill in 2011 that would have created a return-free system. But his assurance hasn’t assuaged the concerns of consumer groups. Mandi Matlock, who is a counsel to the National Consumer Law Center, told me her group’s interpretation of the bill “hasn’t changed”—in part because its text says the government “shall continue to operate” the current Free File P rogram. In their reading, that would prevent the government from terminating it. What to make of all this? At best, the situation seems ambiguous. If Wyden wanted to clarify the situation, he could demand an amendment specifying that the IRS still had the right to create its own free tax-filing system to go up against private companies. When I asked Wyden’s office if that would be a potential solution, they responded, “Senator Wyden wants to work with his colleagues on a path forward and ensure it’s clear.” (I also asked the Free File Alliance, the industry group that works with the government, about its interpretation of the bill, but haven’t heard back). To some extent, this is all missing the forest for the trees. By any reasonable standard, the Free File Program has been a flop, and there’s no particular reason to enshrine it in federal law, especially if it might put limits on the IRS’s ability to create something better. Americans sent in 154 million tax returns in 2018. Just 2.5 million, or 1.6 percent, were submitted via Free File. That stat comes from the National Taxpayer Advocate, which recently published a blog post titled “The Free File Program Is Failing to Achieve Its Objectives and Should be Substantially Improved or Eliminated.” Part of the problem is that Free File has basically zero marketing budget. (“The IRS does not promote or advertise Free File, outside of placing it on its website,” the post notes). But it also apparently has a buggy interface. What Free File lacks in actual, demonstrable success, it makes up for mostly in lobbying support. As ProPublica has documented , tax prep companies like Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, and H&R Block are a force on Capitol Hill. Last year, they spent $6.6 billion trying to influence lawmakers. Over the last two elections, they gave $16,000 to House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neal, a Democrat who calls himself a “longtime champion” of Free File. Democrats do have good reasons to support parts of the Taxpayer First Act. For instance, the bill would bar the IRS from using private debt collectors to pursue low-income Americans who end up in arrears. (Really, the IRS shouldn’t be using private debt collectors at all, since aggressively hiring them as contractors is less cost-effective than having public servants handle collections.) But even if the bill has upsides, and may be less damaging than some of its critics fear, it still seems like a win for lobbying clout over basic, good government."
Watching Game of Thrones was a thrill. Now it’s an obligation.,slate.com,Dan Kois,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-final-season-dread.html,"On Sunday, the final season of Game of Thrones premieres on HBO. The six episodes of this eighth season culminate in the hotly anticipated series finale, which will air May 19. Must I watch them? Much to my surprise, I don’t want to. As the promotional blitz for this final season has overrun us all, I have found that where I once felt excitement for the valedictory beats of a cultural behemoth, I now feel dread. Dread! Dread like what the Army of the North will feel when they face down the white walkers and … ugh . You know. Must I watch them? I dread them! Why do I feel this dread? Well, in part, it’s because I feel fairly certain that the final episodes will be bad. The series has definitely trended in that direction in recent years, and that was while all avenues were still open to Game of Thrones. Now the show must attempt to wrap up an enormous, complicated, long-running story avidly followed by millions in a manner that is both artistically successful and narratively satisfying, a nearly impossible task. (Arguably it’s only been accomplished by two people in human history .) If the past 10 years have taught us anything, it’s that the actual pleasure of watching the end of a prestige television series cannot match the anticipation of doing so. So must I watch these six episodes, given that they will be bad? I’m sure they’ll have stirring scenes in them and fun surprises. The Mountain will get his comeuppance at the Hound’s big hands, I’m sure. But they’re also gonna blow it. They’ll pack far too much into too short a time, desperately attempting to wrap up as many loose ends as possible. They’ll also nevertheless leave too many of those loose ends dangling. Tyrion will do something stupidly out of character. The big battle will look kind of fake. Cersei’s story will be mishandled, or Arya’s, or Sansa’s, or more likely all three of them. Somewhere in Episode 4 they’ll introduce some new character, and I’ll be like, “Who the hell is that?” and it’ll turn out that he’s not new, he was important for one scene in, like, Season 2, which first aired 100 years ago. I’ll need the internet to explain what’s cool about that. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

The show’s canvas is so large, the skein of as-yet-unresolved story threads so tangled, that the likelihood of any of us actually being happy about the way the series ends is essentially nil. And yet! I must give up six Sunday nights for these episodes. Several of these episodes will be as long as an hour and 20 minutes, the precise running time of the Academy Award–winning motion picture Ida —a movie that, as it happens, features a better version of the best death scene in Game of Thrones . Must I watch? In some respects, of course, I do not must watch them. America is, for now, a free country, and I am a grown adult. At the exact moment the premiere of Game of Thrones begins, TCM will be an hour into an airing of Gone With the Wind . I also own a number of books and board games. So I could do any of those things instead. I can’t hang out with my wife or any of my friends, because they will all be watching Game of Thrones . My kids don’t watch the show; I guess I could make them stay up late and hang out with me. As it happens, because of my job, I do must watch the show. For example, the morning after the premiere airs, I am scheduled to record a podcast about the episode. I guess I could just skip it, although that would really leave Sam in the lurch. But the real question I’m asking here isn’t “Must I watch Game of Thrones ?” but “Must we watch Game of Thrones ?” All of us. Must we? It’s not like we won’t watch. To won’t watch is unthinkable. Not only because the human hunger for narrative is so depthless that to never know what ends up happening in this imaginary kingdom would be awful. (There’s always Wikipedia, a great way to learn what happens in cultural products we do not actually intend to experience .) But at this point we’ve sunk upward of 70 hours into this show, most of us, not counting all the time we’ve spent leaving virtual flowers on virtual graves and talking with actual friends at actual watercoolers. And whether or not this is the last show we all watch together , it’s definitely a show we’re all watching together. And so when something happens, as it surely will, many somethings over and over during the next six weeks—exciting things, dumb things—it would be agony not to be watching along with everyone else, our wives and friends and co-workers. It would be agony to miss it. So we must watch. (Some of us have never watched. That was indisputably the right move. Continue not watching. Undoubtedly you’re also not reading. Great. The we in this blog post does not refer to you, and this blog post is not for you.) I remember, when NBC launched the catchphrase “must-see TV” to describe its Thursday night offerings, thinking what an odd phrase that was. In a way it seemed the reductio ad absurdum of all marketing, the secret message that all advertising wishes it had the authority to deliver: not will you consume our product but you must, in fact, consume our product . Not the interrogative but the imperative. Corporations dream of achieving that level of urgency in consumers, whether it’s explicit or implicit in their messaging. Game of Thrones has achieved it. It is must-see. We must see it. Even those of us who must not see it will see it, on billboards and on Oreos and on the internet . Yes, we must watch Game of Thrones . It will fly in on wings of dragons and incinerate us all, Sundays at 9, 8 Central. "
"Lakers, LeBron and free agency: An easy job.",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/lakers-lebron-james-magic-johnson-free-agents.html,"White House Wanted ICE to Arrest Undocumented Immigrants and Then Release Them in Sanctuary Cities as a Lesson Magic Johnson resigned his job running the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday night because, more or less, he thought it was too much of a hassle . The Wall Street Journal has since summed up why Magic’s time with the team, which failed to make the playoffs or even achieve a winning record this season despite having LeBron James on it, was such a disaster:
All the Lakers had to do was construct a team around him that followed the wisdom of the NBA’s crowd. They went contrarian instead. After the series of puzzling moves that overshadowed their signing of LeBron James, Johnson went on national television to defend himself.
“Everybody’s talking about ‘the Lakers don’t have shooting,’” he said in July. “Oh, we got shooting.”
They did not. The Lakers finished the season with a 3-point shooting percentage that ranked 29th of the league’s 30 teams. The Journal gets at what the worst part of this season was for Lakers fans, and really all NBA fans: Not that the Lakers struggled but that they did so in a fashion that was totally predictable even to total boneheads such as myself , surrounding James with declining players that no other team wanted, most egregiously two guards (Rajon Rondo and Lance Stephenson) who can’t shoot. It was an entirely avoidable fiasco that took place while teams like the Milwaukee Bucks and Indiana Pacers—which are located in cities that are not warm-weather capitals of celebrity and luxury lifestyle—recruited useful free agent role players with whom they subsequently won many more games than the team in L.A. did. And it deprived society of the chance to see LeBron James, who despite being old by sports standards (34) is still very good , in the playoffs in Los Angeles, which, regardless of whether you root for the Lakers, would have been a compelling event. In this way Magic didn’t just let his team down, he let America down. The good news: Whereas most teams need to balance the urge to “win now” against the need to plan for the future, James is 1) already signed with the Lakers for at least two more years and 2) a far better player, when he’s at his best, than anyone else the Lakers could add. The team has a much, much better chance of winning a championship in the next two or three years—while James is still in his late prime—than it will after he leaves or retires. James’ unique current combination of age and immense skill has blessed the team with the rare freedom not to worry, like every other team in every sport has to these days, about playing extra-dimensional prospect-and-asset management chess , and to instead to just get the guys who are obviously good at basketball at this exact moment. And they are actually set up just fine to do that. The Lakers currently have room under the salary cap to add another star alongside James, and there are a number of stars who will be available this summer as free agents. They also still have a smattering of low-salaried young players filling out their roster who, though they have some flaws, are talented and improving. Really, all the Lakers need to do is sign the first guy on this list of overall top free agents who’s willing to play for them, then sign as many of the free agents on this list of leading three-point shooters as they can before their money runs out. Of course, the team basically had the same freedom and obvious needs last off-season too, and messed it up thanks to familial and organizational dysfunction and Magic’s too-clever “flexibility” plan . A nation—nay, a world —of basketball fans can only now hope that dumb lightning doesn’t strike twice. Support our journalism

Kim Kardashian plans to become a lawyer. Can she really do it without a college degree?,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/kim-kardashian-lawyer-no-college-legal-explainer.html,"Most Americans Encounter “Diversity” in Their Workplaces—Which May Explain Why American Social Life Isn’t That Diverse In a Vogue profile published on Wednesday, Kim Kardashian revealed she’s studying to become a lawyer and aims to take the California bar in 2022. She will not go to law school. This plan, the magazine notes, is not a unique Kardashian scheme but rather a perfectly legal alternative to the typical American lawyer’s career path in some states. But is skipping law school actually something that noncelebrities do? And, more important, is it a good idea? The short answer is that very few people forgo a JD on their path to the law—but, in my view, more should. California, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington allow aspiring lawyers to study under an apprentice for several years, then take the bar exam alongside law school graduates. If they pass, they can work as fully credentialed lawyers in the state. Individuals who choose this route in California must study in a law office for four years, at least 18 hours a week, and pass a “ baby bar ” after the first year. They must pay a $150 fee to start, followed by a biannual payment to the California bar of $30. The full cost rarely exceeds more than a few thousand dollars , compared with more than $150,000 for three years at many California law schools. Why does this program exist? It’s actually a carryover from an earlier period in American history, when all aspiring lawyers “read law” rather than attend school, then took an exam to gain admission to the bar. Many celebrated attorneys of the 18 th century, including John Adams, John Marshall, and Abraham Lincoln, followed this route. In fact, the first Supreme Court justice to hold a law degree was Benjamin Robbins Curtis, who joined in 1851 (and was not one of its leading lights). The practice of “reading law” began to fade in the 1870s when law schools emerged as a more standardized alternative. The last justice to join the Supreme Court without holding a JD, the widely respected Robert H. Jackson, was appointed in 1941. Even though “reading law” remains a possibility in some states today, this route does have some major drawbacks. First, it can be difficult for would-be apprentices to find a mentor willing to work with them closely over several years. Second, the bar exam pass rate for apprentices is quite low— 28 percent in 2013 , compared with a 73 percent pass rate for graduates of an American Bar Association–accredited law school. Third, those apprentices who do pass the bar won’t be able to practice in most other states. If you graduate from law school, take the bar in one state, then move somewhere else, you can usually either transfer your exam scores or, at worst, take the bar in your new state of residence. But if you do not hold a JD, most states won’t let you practice, even if you take the bar. Put simply, if you “read law” in California, you’d better intend to practice in California exclusively. Despite these problems, I strongly support programs like California’s, and I wish more states would allow them. Law school is an exorbitant racket that condemns countless students to years, even decades, of crushing student debt. Many young lawyers fear they can only pay off this debt by entering big law, then wind up spending years in a corporate practice that is soulless at best and immoral at worst. Too many American attorneys are sucked into this vicious circle. Some burn out after toiling under abusive bosses who demand endless hours of draining, unfulfilling labor. Others adapt and rationalize their unsavory work by taking on the occasional pro bono case. No wonder American lawyers struggle with sky-high rates of substance abuse and depression . Kardashian is not going to fix this nightmare. But apprenticeships do offer a much cheaper path for law-curious Americans who don’t wish to spend a large chunk of their careers paying off a mountain of student debt. If Kardashian inspires more people to “read law” in the states that permit it, she’ll deserve credit for challenging the law school monopoly, even just a little. "
William Barr accidentally concedes his reason for withholding the Mueller report is baloney.,slate.com,Jeremy Stahl,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/william-barr-testimony-mueller-report-baloney-watergate.html,"William Barr Accidentally Concedes His Reason for Withholding the Mueller Report Is Baloney Slate 6 days ago Jeremy Stahl © Provided by The Slate Group LLC Attorney General William Barr said something he shouldn’t have. Whoops. Mandel Ngan/Getty Images William Barr testified before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Wednesday and made headlines for promising to investigate former Obama officials who began the counter-intelligence probes into members of President Trump’s 2016 campaign.
There was a lesser noticed moment of his testimony, though, that should have perked up the ears of House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler if he was listening.
During questioning from Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, Barr acknowledged that there was precedent for releasing the entire unredacted Mueller report to Congress. This contradicts what he has said repeatedly over the course of two days of testimony, in which he has been adamant that there is no way around rules governing grand jury secrecy.
The exchange in question came roughly midway through the two-hour testimony. Capito was attempting to solicit a response from Barr explaining how crazy it would be for Congress to receive grand jury information. Here’s the key portion :
Capito: We hear a cry on Capitol Hill to release the entire report. I just want to reemphasize what you stated [..] that would be a very unprecedented and damaging to just put the whole thing out there and an unreasonable request. Am I stating that correctly.
Barr: I don’t know if it would be unprecedented since I’m not really sure what happened in the Watergate situation. I know the report came out 50 years later, I think.
At this point, Capito attempted to steer the conversation back on course, Barr stuttered for a moment, and then returned to her line of argument. “It’s essentially unprecedented, I would say,” he concluded.
“Essentially unprecedented” is not “ unprecedented .” And Barr, the incredibly smart Washington lawyer that he is, noted the perfect precedent: Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski’s cooperation and sharing of confidential grand jury materials with the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate inquiry.
In that case, which Barr brought up, a “Road Map” for impeachment from the Watergate grand jury itself was released publicly last October after 44 years of being sealed by the court. However, that Road Map—with all of the secret grand jury material that it included—was sent at the time of the Watergate investigation directly to Congress for consideration.
As Jaworski wrote in his memoir, the decision to send the report to the judiciary committee at the time was “without legal precedent, but it seemed to be legally proper—if we prepared the information properly.”
Indeed, after Watergate, sending grand jury materials to Congress for the purposes of an impeachment inquiry is no longer without precedent. This is, in fact, the precise precedent that should guide Barr.
Unfortunately, the attorney general has repeatedly said he won’t be following that precedent. Instead, he has claimed—again contrary to the precedent he himself cited—that there’s likely no way around the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) against revealing grand jury information.
In testimony before a House appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday, for example, Barr said that Nadler would have to “ go to court ” if he wanted access to the full prosecutorial report. On Wednesday before the Senate appropriations subcommittee, he hedged a bit and said he would try to work with the judiciary committees in both houses of Congress to see what he could give them. But he also emphasized multiple times that he would not be able to work around 6(e).
“The category that I think is the most inflexible under the law right now is the grand jury material,” Barr told the Senate subcommittee.
The attorney general added that he didn’t think that there was any request Nadler could make that would be covered by one of the multiple exceptions to 6(e). “If someone shows me and makes a persuasive argument that it’s covered, then I’m willing to listen to that, but I don’t see it,” he said.
The statute in question, however, states that exceptions be made for any “judicial proceeding.” A district court that ruled just last week on the issue of grand jury secrecy in another case stated that the Watergate precedents still held and that grand jury information could be released to Congress in connection with an impeachment inquiry, which would constitute a “judicial proceeding.”
In accidentally revealing his legal knowledge of the governing precedent, Barr showed how hollow his position of withholding the full report from Congress is. Should he force the issue and press the judiciary committee into taking the matter to court, the committee’s attorneys should cite Barr’s own words acknowledging the actual governing precedent against him.

New Zealand Parliament Passes Ban on Semi-Automatic Weapons by 119-1 Vote,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/new-zealand-parliament-passes-semi-automatic-weapons-ban-by-119-1-vote.html,"Trump Says Voters Don’t Care About Seeing His Tax Returns. He Couldn’t Be More Wrong. Less than a month after a deadly mosque shooting by a white nationalist, New Zealand passed a law Wednesday banning the most types of semiautomatic weapons. Parliament voted 119-1 to make permanent what were temporary restrictions imposed in the aftermath of the shooting that killed 50 people in the city of Christchurch. The law covers military-style semiautomatic weapons, like the AR-15 , which used in the Christchurch attack as well as in a number of mass shootings in the U.S., including the Parkland school shooting last year. The rapid legislative change came not just in response to the tragic shooting, but the fact that the weapons used were bought legally and then modified. “I can recall very vividly the moment I knew that we would need to be here, doing what we are doing right now,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. “I could not fathom how weapons that could cause such destruction and large-scale death could have been obtained legally in this country.” The sole parliamentarian to oppose tightening the country’s gun laws was David Seymour of the right wing ACT Party. In an opinion piece , he criticized the speed at which the changes were made, and made a number of arguments that ought to be familiar to Americans who have heard it all before. “By banning all semi-automatic weapons, the Prime Minister made legal owners of such weapons pay a cost for something they had not done,” Seymour wrote. “Right now, there’s no reason to be confident the ban will make it harder for determined bad people to access dangerous weapons.” The changes to the country’s gun laws garnered widespread support, however, and did take into consideration the views of the country’s many remote rural communities. “Experts studying New Zealand gun laws say such changes had been recommended to Parliament several times but always met with opposition,” the Washington Post reports . “Four inquiries on gun laws have been undertaken by the New Zealand government in recent years, including one after a 1990 mass shooting that killed 13.” The government has established a buyback program that will run until Sept. 30, giving gun owners a five-plus month amnesty during which they can hand over any weapons covered by the ban."

He Couldn’t Be More Wrong. Prominent Democratic attorney and former Obama White House counsel Gregory Craig expects to be indicted in the coming days in relation to his work with lobbyist Paul Manafort in Ukraine in 2012, his lawyers said Wednesday. Craig, who also worked in the Clinton White House, is facing charges for his work at the law firm Skadden Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, where he was a partner at the time. The firm was hired by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to review his Justice Ministry’s prosecution of a chief rival, Yulia ­Tymoshenko, which led to her being imprisoned by the regime. Skadden produced a 187-page report on the case and claimed it was an independent analysis while failing to disclose the firm was being paid by the Ukrainian government to produce it. Manafort and other lobbyists working for the Yanukovych regime spread the Skadden report widely in an effort to sanitize their guy in the face of criticism of the conviction and his record more generally. When the Justice Department queried the firm in 2012 to see whether its work on behalf of Yanukovych required it to register as a foreign agent, Craig responded in a in September 2013 letter to the DOJ saying he “in no way serving as an agent for Ukraine.” The DOJ agreed at the time, but when the Mueller investigation led to a deep dive into years of murky work by Paul Manafort in Ukraine, Craig’s characterization of his work came under renewed scrutiny by prosecutors. “Skadden in January reached a settlement with the Justice Department, admitting it should have registered for its work in 2012 and 2013, and agreed to turn over the $4.6 million in fees it made for the report in exchange for facing no criminal charges,” the Washington Post notes . “In its settlement, Skadden agreed that DOJ’s 2014 finding that the firm did not need to register came after DOJ relied on ‘false and misleading oral and written statements’ made by Craig.”"

The movie, written by Glover’s brother Stephen Glover and directed by Glover’s Atlanta and “This Is America” collaborator Hiro Murai , was secretly filmed in Havana last summer during a gap between Glover’s Solo: A Star Wars Story publicity tour and a fall concert tour as Childish Gambino. Said to be inspired by both City of God and Purple Rain , the hour-long, music-driven movie is a thriller in which Glover’s character attempts to throw a festival on an island, presumably the sort of island where one might find guava. Rihanna plays Glover’s love interest, and Black Panther ’s Letitia Wright is also featured.

Conan O'Brien: Andy Richter's Sports Blast is a model for digital journalism in the 21st century.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/andy-richter-sports-blast-conan-obrien-andres-du-bouchet.html,"Sports! TBS Part of our country’s decades-long jocks vs. nerds hangover is a tradition of jokes in which the comedian makes a point of not knowing anything about sports, often involving the use of the word “ sportsball .” The first time Conan ’s Andy Richter presented a segment called “Andy Richter’s Sports Blast” about a year ago, it was squarely in the middle of that stream: Richter did an impersonation of a brash, jock-gone-to-seed sports commentator who somehow knows nothing about sports, and although it had a few touches of absurdist humor, it mostly made jokes at the expense of people who care about sports from the perspective of a sports outsider. But over subsequent “Andy Richter’s Sports Blast” segments, the show’s writers layered in more and more jokes about, basically, television production: chyrons for subsegments like the “Wall of Basketballs” start invading the screen at the wrong moment, Conan O’Brien and Richter get caught in a loop telling each other “back to you!” and the recorded voice yelling “Sports!” gets more and more insistent. On Wednesday, the “Sports Blast” segment finally achieved its final form: That is a goddamned symphony. O’Brien and Richter intro Sports Blast with a sort of Oscar-presenter-banter delivery where every line is a little late, and Richter has turned down the ex-jock vibes from the segment’s initial run in favor of just playing someone with no idea what to do in front of a television camera. And adding Andrés du Bouchet as greenscreen correspondent Trey Triplethird III (!) is a stroke of genius. This isn’t just the best version of “Andy Richter’s Sports Blast,” it’s a model for what journalism could someday become.

The charges relate to his role in the 2010 publication of a trove of Iraq War documents and diplomatic cables leaked by Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning—what the DOJ called in its press release “one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States.” In a court document unsealed Thursday by federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia, prosecutors allege Assange “engaged in a conspiracy” with Manning by helping her crack a password stored on Defense Department computers connected to a network only used for classified documents and classified communication. The DOJ also said in the press release that Assange urged Manning to find more documents for him to publish. Assange is charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion and faces a maximum of five years in prison. In the U.K., Assange faces charges of “failing to surrender to the court” for extradition stemming from a 2012 rape inquiry in Sweden, which has since been closed without formal charges against Assange. According to the Guardian , the Swedish news site Expressen is reporting that a lawyer who represents one of Assange’s accusers in Sweden has submitted a request to have the preliminary investigation into the case resumed. Assange pleaded not guilty to the charges of skipping bail, according to the BBC . He faces up to a year in prison in the U.K. Assange has been under investigation in the U.S. for potentially more severe crimes, such as espionage, the publication of sensitive government documents, and coordination with Russia. WikiLeaks released thousands of stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and from John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, during the run-up to the 2016 election in what some have considered an act that may have swayed the outcome of the election. Intelligence officials later determined that Russian hackers, under the supervision of the Russian government, had obtained the emails. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation found that Russian military intelligence officers had discussed releasing those emails to WikiLeaks at a time that would do the most damage to Clinton’s campaign. But Assange’s potential extradition appears related only to the charges stemming from the 2010 leak of Iraq War secrets. Manning served seven years of a 35-year sentence in prison on espionage and other charges until President Obama commuted her sentence in January 2017, but WikiLeaks itself was saved by First Amendment press protections. (Manning was jailed again last month for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks and Assange.) Since the leak, the Department of Justice had continued to weigh the possibility of charging Assange. Although the Obama administration decided to avoid setting a precedent that could curtail press freedoms, the Trump administration, which has been more zealous about prosecuting leaks and appeared to have set up the argument that WikiLeaks is not a journalistic organization, is now charging Assange for his alleged role in helping Manning steal the documents, not for publishing them—a notable difference for those concerned about press freedoms. In November, a court filing for a separate case accidentally revealed that Assange had been charged under seal. A judge in the Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Thursday found Assange guilty of breaching bail and referred him to Crown Court for sentencing, calling him a “narcissist who cannot get beyond his own selfish interest.” His extradition hearing is scheduled for May 2. U.S. officials confirmed to the Washington Post that extradition papers have already been prepared. Carlos Poveda, Assange’s lawyer in Ecuador, told ABC News that he believed the arrest violated international conventions on human rights. Earlier this month, Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno accused WikiLeaks of leaking personal information about him and intercepting phone calls and private conversations, according to the Associated Press . After Assange’s arrest Thursday, Moreno released a video statement in which he denounced “the discourteous and aggressive behavior of Mr. Julian Assange” and explained that his behavior and “the hostile and threatening declarations of its allied organization, against Ecuador, and especially the transgression of international treaties” had led to the country’s decision to withdraw asylum. He specifically cited the leaking of documents from the Vatican in January in his condemnation of WikiLeaks’ meddling in other states’ affairs. Assange’s relationship with the Ecuadorian government had long been reported to be rocky , and for almost a year there had been talk of the government withdrawing asylum. In response to the news, WikiLeaks has reasserted on Twitter that Assange was acting as a journalist and is being unfairly persecuted. “This man is a son, a father, a brother,” WikiLeaks said on Twitter . “He has won dozens of journalism awards. He’s been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year since 2010. Powerful actors, including CIA, are engaged in a sophisticated effort to dehumanise, delegitimize and imprison him.”"
Louisiana church fires: Deputy sheriff's son arrested for alleged arsons of historically black churches.,slate.com,Aaron Mak,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/louisiana-historically-black-church-fires-arrest-arson.html,"For the Anti-Abortion Far Right, Six-Week Bans Are Just the Beginning Louisiana authorities arrested 21-year-old Holden Matthews on Wednesday night in connection with a series of three fires allegedly set at historically black churches in St. Landry Parish over the course of 10 days. Matthews, the son of a St. Landry Parish deputy sheriff, faces charges of simple arson for each fire. Police allege Matthews struck St. Mary Baptist in Port Barre on March 26, the Greater Union Baptist Church on April 2, and Mount Pleasant Baptist in Opelousas on April 4. The fires brought down walls and reduced much of the churches’ interiors to rubble, though no one was hurt. Investigators say they found “ suspicious elements ” in each case. They have declined to identify a motive. The FBI and the ATF have been assisting local law enforcement in the investigation . There was also a fourth fire, which investigators believe had been “intentionally set,” at a predominantly white church in a parish three hours away on March 31, but it is unclear whether this case is connected with the others. St. Landry is a rural area in Louisiana with a population that is 56 percent white and 41 percent black. The pastor at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, the Rev. Gerald Toussaint, told the New York Times that relations between black and white people in the parish were generally good. Pastors in the area have reportedly taken to installing security cameras and sleeping in their churches, or in cars outside their churches, as precautionary measures. The NAACP released a statement on the fires, which read in part, “The spike in church burnings in Southern states is a reflection of the emboldened racial rhetoric and tension spreading across the country.” Black churches have long been the target of racist domestic terrorism in the form of bombings, arson, and armed assaults. Based on the most recent data available, hate crimes in the U.S. have been on the rise in recent years. The FBI reported 7,175 hate crimes in 2017, a 17 percent increase from 2016, making it the third year in a row that the number of such incidents has increased. "
"Mueller, Obama Deep State taking down Obama's lawyer.",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-deep-state-obama-lawyer.html,"A Democratic Senator Just Endorsed GOP Sen. Susan Collins for Reelection in Maine, a Key Battleground State On Wednesday, Attorney General William Barr told a congressional committee in vague terms that he planned to investigate whether the FBI engaged in improper “spying” on the 2016 Trump campaign. Barr’s comments seemed like pandering to the conspiratorial remarks his boss, Donald Trump, has made and continues to make about the FBI’s Russia inquiry, which eventually came to be led by Robert Mueller’s special counsel team; the president has characterized that investigation as a “treasonous hoax” perpetrated by “angry Democrats” and highlighted by Barack Obama’s order to wiretap Trump Tower . (There is no evidence that Obama or anyone else wiretapped Trump Tower. I’m sorry I always have to write these tedious parentheticals about things the president says.) In other Mueller news, news reports say that an indictment related to the special counsel’s work is expected to be filed shortly in Washington federal court against an individual named Greg Craig, who was … Barack Obama’s White House counsel. ( Update, 3:45 p.m.: Craig was indeed indicted on Thursday.) The backstory is that Craig, after leaving the White House in 2010, joined the law firm Skadden Arps, where he later was involved in the preparation of a 2012 report about Ukrainian politician Yulia Tymoshenko that was commissioned by a rival politician, Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych also employed Paul Manafort as an adviser, which is how Mueller became interested in Skadden’s report; this January, the firm admitted in a settlement that it had failed to properly disclose its Ukraine work as required by the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The Department of Justice has now charged Craig with two counts of making false statements with the intent of evading FARA requirements. (An attorney for Craig says he is not guilty of any crime.) Will the indictment of Barack Obama’s actual government lawyer because of work done by Republican prosecutor Robert Mueller dissuade Trump and his enablers in right-wing media from continuing to claim that the special counsel investigation was a scam hoax created by Obama loyalists deep inside the government legal apparatus to target Donald Trump for partisan reasons?"

Elizabeth Warren's $6 million shows she's not doomed.,slate.com,Josh Voorhees,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/elizabeth-warren-momentum-fundraising-coverage.html,"Trump Says Voters Don’t Care About Seeing His Tax Returns. He Couldn’t Be More Wrong. Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced on Wednesday that her campaign had raised roughly $6 million during the first three months of 2019—a total that, like nearly everything at this point in the campaign , is largely a matter of perspective. It was middling compared with her rivals’ hauls, but a veritable bonanza when viewed through the lens of what were exceedingly low expectations . To use a technical political science term, then, Warren’s total was fine —enough to keep the lights on for the foreseeable future, but not enough to fundamentally change her current position in the second tier of credible candidates who are bunched up behind the favorites. Fine , however, is all Warren needs right now. Despite the doomsaying about her relatively lackluster showing in the early polls, the reality is that there hasn’t been all that much movement to date for anyone other than Pete Buttigieg ( and even then only if you squint ). There’s Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders way out in front, and then there’s everyone else. Warren’s first-quarter total is unlikely to change that, but it should be enough to fend off the She’s doomed narrative that was threatening to take hold following a New York Times story late last month about her early fundraising struggles. That kind of perception can become a self-fulfilling prophecy—a rough first quarter would have dogged her on the trail while also giving her fans second thoughts about cutting a check to her campaign. More importantly for Warren, her not-bad, not-great fundraising total will allow her to return to what she does best: rolling out bold new policy proposals that have increasingly won her praise from pundits, politicos, and political journalists, including myself . The general mood of the media is impossible to quantify, but there’s been a noticeable burst of opinion writers at mainstream outlets singing her praises and rallying to her defense—in both direct and indirect ways, and often with research to back up their points. This week alone: The Atlantic’s Peter Beinart argued that Warren is suffering from the “double bind” dynamic that makes it difficult for female candidates to be seen as both competent and inspirational. The New York Times’ Jill Filipovic took issue with gendered campaign coverage more broadly, arguing that women like Warren are unfairly seen as “too young and inexperienced right up until they are branded too old and tedious.” And the Washington Post’s David Byler made the case that Warren still has plenty of time to break out—a piece that came just days after a news story in the same paper vouched for Warren’s policy chops. There’s been a similar thing happening on Twitter as well, with journalists like Vox’s Matthew Yglesias singing her policy praises, the Post’s David Weigel touting her as an underrated campaigner, BuzzFeed’s Darren Sands noting her growing support among black women, and FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver dubbing her a “scrappy underdog who is slowly gaining momentum with high-information voters.” Twitter is not the real world, as this week’s saying goes , but it can serve as an early predictor of the coverage to come, which can have a bearing in the real world. Warren’s slow start was due, in part, to her misguided decision to release her DNA ancestry results late last year, which then fed into the unhelpful discussion about her likability and electability, two questions that are at best silly and at worst unfair to any candidate who doesn’t look like past occupants of Oval Office. But there’s some limited evidence that Warren has already started to weather that storm by churning out one big policy proposal after another. According to Northeastern University’s Storybench project —which tracks the tone and content of a small subset of campaign coverage—the five most-read news outlets were fixated on the Cherokee ancestry controversy in their coverage of Warren in February, but devoted far more of their attention to her policy proposals in March. That’s a trend that is likely to continue. Following her fundraising announcement, for instance, Warren unveiled an ambitious new plan Thursday to hike taxes on the largest, most profitable U.S. companies. “The proposal comes,” as Politico put it , “as Warren has established herself as the policy maven of the Democratic presidential primary.” Winning the Policy Primary won’t earn her any delegates, but neither will anything else between now and Iowa.

How Game of Thrones lost interest in Tyrion Lannister.,slate.com,Inkoo Kang,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/tyrion-lannister-game-of-thrones.html,"Is CBS Piping Fake Birds Into Its Masters Coverage? We Asked a Professor Who Tracks Golf Bird Calls. When we last saw Tyrion Lannister on Game of Thrones , in the final episode of Season 7 (nearly a year and a half ago!), he was lingering in the shadows, his shoulders slumped in disappointment as he watched his queen, Daenerys Targaryen, and their ally Jon Snow engage in some rather enthusiastic accidental incest. Sidelined, desexualized, and overcome with worry, Tyrion’s was a position more familiar to the castrated spymaster Varys—not coincidentally the figure the black-sheep Lannister had spent the most time with for the past two seasons as the pair crossed continents in search of Daenerys’ favor. Tyrion once loomed largest among the HBO drama’s approximately 17 million characters, serving as the show’s default protagonist (and garnering the actor who plays him, Peter Dinklage, three Emmy wins, another four nominations, and a Golden Globe). But that brief moment in the finale seemed to confirm the second-banana status of Daenerys’ recently promoted hand. How did the fan favorite—the character most beloved by author George R.R. Martin himself—lose his place in the spotlight? And is Game of Thrones better for that loss? It’s easy to see why Tyrion became the show’s first breakout character. We were always meant to identify with the youngest Lannister, an aristocratic dwarf whose out-of-placeness in Westerosi society made him an underdog hero. Weak but wealthy, smart but softhearted, Tyrion’s ever-variable status was a microcosm of the instability of the Seven Kingdoms. It’s hard to understate how radical the character still is in terms of the representation of little people, as Dinklage—one of the few known actors in the cast upon the show’s debut—threw every ounce of sexual charisma and merlot-dry wit he had at the screen. Above all, Tyrion was instantly worth rooting for on a show that became infamous for its brutality (or, some might rightly argue, its sadism), because he offered hope that just because a person came from this bleak place didn’t mean they had to be of it. He refused to sleep with Sansa after their forced marriage in Season 3. He’s one of the few royals who spares a thought for the common people as fellow human beings. And he slapped Joffrey—more than once!—thus giving the audience what we most craved at the time. But as every nattering no-name whose violent opportunism leads to their bloody downfall can attest, Game of Thrones does not have a lot of character types. The storylines and roles that made Tyrion so beloved were replicated in later seasons, often with far more depth. After setting up his younger brother with a prostitute when they were teens (with the woman posing as the victim of a crime who Tyrion would help “rescue”), Jaime turned out to be the show’s most tragic romantic. And Jaime’s surprisingly tender friendship with his former captor Brienne of Tarth supplanted Tyrion and Bronn’s contentious alliance as the series’ most memorable buddy-comedy pairing. A survive-at-all-costs Cersei has emerged as the Lannister whose death we’ll mourn most (don’t @ me), while bookish Samwell Tarly took over as the nerdy male-audience surrogate who gets with girls far more conventionally attractive than he is. At the end of Season 4, Tyrion accomplishes what he’s seemed destined to do from birth: killing his dick of a dad, Tywin Lannister. Game of Thrones hasn’t given him much to do in the three seasons since. His adventures with Varys abroad turned out to be a wan sequel to his swashbuckling with sellsword Bronn, whose transactional friendship constantly tested the limits of what Tyrion could buy with his family’s money. His long-awaited meeting with Daenerys led to a new role in the fight for the Iron Throne, but his military tactics, which saved King’s Landing from Stannis’ invasion in Season 2’s Battle of the Blackwater, cost the Dothraki queen several crucial allies by Season 7. Meanwhile, botched attempts at levity, like the scene in which Tyrion teaches Grey Worm and Missandei how to make a joke, have only underscored how alarmingly underdeveloped the show’s darker-skinned characters are and always have been. Even Dinklage’s rakish charm is no match for the Daenerys Narrative Prison of Waiting Around Doing Nothing in an Intriguingly Angular but Implausibly Empty Set and Occasionally Visiting Her Dragons (aka the DNPWADNIAIESOVHD).

Dinklage’s ability to sell Tyrion as a boozer and a whorer has always been about as believable as his mushy English accent; he has too intellectual a mien for that. (“I drink and I know things” feels about half right.) The Lannister’s DGAF libertinism has always struck me as that of a poor rich boy putting on an act, like a trust-fund kid who never showers to show everyone how real he is. Still, after his act of patricide, it would have been more fitting to see Tyrion live out the rest of his years as an anonymous barkeep in sunny Dorne, laughing to keep from crying when a traveling troupe of actors reenact his family’s many tragedies as farce. Sure, he’s still got things to teach Dany, like when he reminds her, “Killing and politics aren’t always the same thing.” But if we want modern enlightenment to win out over medieval superstition in the end, Tyrion’s partnership with the seemingly unstoppable Daenerys isn’t going to make the crusade for those values any more suspenseful. At this juncture, it seems like the show might have felt tauter, and no less resonant, if we’d seen as much of the post-Tywin Tyrion as we have of Hot Pie. Game of Thrones once sought to subvert heroic tropes: Ned Stark set up his own execution because he was too much of a Good Guy. Tyrion’s rise on the show fit that project; he wasn’t morally conflicted enough to be an antihero, but he certainly validated, if not glamorized, beta-male softness. But with humanity’s survival at stake, the show has realigned its priorities, and anyone without an army at their disposal is relegated to also-ran. Tyrion’s once-distinct mix of radical empathy and bright-eyed ambition now seems perpetually shrouded in the shadow of Daenerys’ dragons. He’s strived for heroism, but heroism no longer has a place for him. "
Joe Biden friendly with segregationist James Eastland and Jeb Bush.,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/joe-biden-segregationist-jeb-bush.html,"A Democratic Senator Just Endorsed GOP Sen. Susan Collins for Reelection in Maine, a Key Battleground State Joe Biden’s presidential campaign hasn’t been formally announced, but it already has a theme, which is that Biden is the only Democrat with the kind of bipartisan appeal and common touch needed to win white working-class voters in key swing states back to the Democratic Party. Two events on Thursday underlined that theme, then circled it in red ink and drew a bunch of big exclamation marks around it. First, CNN published a piece about letters that Biden, then a young senator from Delaware, wrote to Mississippi Democratic Sen. James Eastland in 1977. Eastland believed that desegregation would “ mongrelize ” the white race and had denounced the Brown vs. Board of Education decision, calling it a “ monstrous crime “; in 1977, Biden sought his support for a bill that would cut down on the practice of busing students between neighborhoods to integrate schools. Wrote Biden to Eastland: “My bill strikes at the heart of the injustice of court-ordered busing.” (It doesn’t appear that the bill in question was ever passed by the full Senate , but other anti-busing measures that Biden pursued were successful .) Then, Biden, appearing at a University of Pennsylvania panel on opioid addiction with Jeb Bush, complimented Bush as “ a hell of a governor .” From the Democratic perspective, Bush’s tenure as the governor of Florida was probably most notable for his relentless effort, supported by right-wing evangelical groups, to prevent Terri Schiavo’s husband from removing her feeding tube after she’d been in a vegetative state for 15 years; Bush also signed the “stand your ground” law that came under national scrutiny after George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin. Strategically, Biden seems to be betting that his association with Barack Obama is going to keep him from losing support among progressives and people of color over things like this. And, like, he’s really, really betting that. Support our journalism

My Hungry Cat Is Ruining My Mornings. How Can I Stop Her Pre-Dawn Wailing?,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/cat-hungry-wails-whines-cries-mornings.html,"Dear Beast Mode: I’m Moving Cross-Country With My Cat. Should We Fly or Drive? Dear Beast Mode, I have a 13-year-old cat who has grown increasingly vocal with me as she has aged. She is a food-centric little beast (she’s on a diet to keep her at a reasonable weight), and she is extremely loud before both of her feeding times. On the weekdays, I need to get up at 6:15 a.m., but I love to sleep in on the weekends. This is something Princess doesn’t quite appreciate.Of late, the weekends have become a nonstop cryfest until I wake up, and when I recently locked her out of my room as punishment, she howled for an hour outside and scratched at the door. Am I doing the wrong thing by locking her out of the room when she cries this way? Is there any possible way for her to understand the concept of the weekend? —Early Cat Gets the Whine Dear Early Cat Gets the Whine, Cats don’t have weekends. Now, I know what you are thinking: If that’s the case, then why does Garfield hate Mondays? Garfield creator Jim Davis actually explained this during a 2014 interview :
Garfield does not have a job, Garfield does not go to school, and every day is the same. Nevertheless every Monday is just a reminder that his life is the same old, same old cycling again, and for some reason, even though his life is pretty much the same every day, on Mondays specifically, awful things tend to happen to him physically. It’s a very fun cartoon. Princess doesn’t suffer the same existential misery as Garfield. She has a pretty nice life, and she certainly has no qualms about letting her personal chef know when it’s time to eat. You may not be able to get her to read a calendar, but there are a few steps you can take to quiet things down on weekend mornings. Princess is probably having some trouble adjusting to her new diet. Changing a pet’s behavior usually involves lots of patience. These issues are often deeply ingrained, so quick fixes are rare. Luckily for you and Princess, this particular problem can be solved without needing to address her behavior, and it’s all thanks to robots. “What I would do is purchase a timed feeder,” certified feline behavior consultant Ingrid Johnson tells me. These devices automatically dispense food into a bowl, and Johnson recommends putting one far away from your bedroom on weekends and setting it for Princess’ normal breakfast time. “The cat will hear the feeder pop open and then run to the opposite side of the house to eat. And they didn’t have to wake Mom up to make that happen.” Easy! If you want to spend the money. You can find some models on Amazon for about $40, though it’s possible to spend more than $200 on an automatic feeder. But if you’d rather not invite a cat-feeding robot into your home, there are other ways to wean Princess off her morning schedule. Just keep in mind that it will have to happen gradually. “If the work schedule during the weekdays allows it, she can start inching out her morning feeding schedule,” Johnson says. “For example, do a couple of other things first before feeding the cat. Eat breakfast, drink your morning coffee, get ready for work, and then feed her, so you’re pushing back that time.” This is a simple solution, though Johnson acknowledges that delaying the cat’s breakfast by half an hour might not revolutionize your weekends: “I know for me, personally, that’s not sleeping in.” Princess is probably having some trouble adjusting to her new diet, which may account for the screaming. “Some of it may be habit, just to wake Mom up and get attention,” Johnson says. “But if it’s truly food-related and hunger, then we might be restricting and meal-feeding too strictly.” Talk to your vet about the possibility of leaving food-dispensing toys around the house while you are gone as a way to space out her meals and keep her occupied during the day. It’s also wise to check for any medical issues, as her whining could indicate an underlying issue. “Thyroid disease can make cats hungry and obnoxious,” Johnson says. Otherwise, give that automatic feeder a try. The device may save your weekends. If only there were a machine that could cheer Garfield up. "

Thanks to Wednesday’s compromise in Brussels , the U.K. won’t be crashing out of the European Union on Friday without a Brexit deal. British leaders still have a lot of decisions ahead, and the way forward is no more clear than before. Today in Parliament: There’s one reason for even the most hardline Brexiteer MP to celebrate the six-month extension: It means they get to go on recess ! The recess, which starts tomorrow, might have been canceled if members still needed to hammer out a deal or cope with the fallout of a no-deal Brexit, but for now, they’ll have until April 23 to rest, relax, and plot coups against Theresa May. May returned to London to brief Parliament on the “flextension” the EU had granted and urged her colleagues to “use the opportunity of the Recess to reflect on the decisions that will have to be made swiftly on our return after Easter. And let us then resolve to find a way through this impasse.” The new Brexit deadline is Oct. 31, but under the terms of the extension, it can still happen sooner if Parliament would finally agree to pass May’s withdrawal agreement, which MPs have now rejected three times. May wants this to happen by this summer, so that the U.K. doesn’t have to participate in EU Parliament elections, but preparations for those elections are beginning anyway . Calls for a new referendum on Brexit are also growing now that there’s actually time to organize one before the deadline. During Prime Minister’s Questions, May batted away reports that there’s been little headway in her cross-party talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying the two sides have substantial agreement on whether to keep Britain in a customs union with Europe, Labour’s main condition for supporting the withdrawal agreement and something which Brexiteers vehemently reject. She also refused to rule out asking for yet another extension and rejected one Tory MP’s call for her to resign. The Guardian’s Andrew Sparrow notes that “in the Commons the Brexiter response was close to subdued,” considering the tumult that was supposedly going to break out if Brexit wasn’t delivered. Maybe everyone’s just ready for a break. Today in polls: Several recent polls show Labour now solidly leading the Conservatives. Local elections on May 2 could turn into a referendum on the governing party’s failure to deliver Brexit. Paul Waugh of HuffPost UK suggests that the Liberal Democrats, rather than Labour, could end up being the big winners in that vote. Today in What is Emmanuel Macron’s deal? The French president reportedly annoyed his fellow European leaders during Wednesday night’s dinner/debate in Brussels, when he insisted on speaking last and launched a one-man crusade to prevent the long Brexit extension of nine to 12 months that the other 26 leaders favored. Macron was unconvinced that the May-Corbyn talks would bear fruit and worried that Britain would play the role of spoiler if it stuck around in the EU Parliament too long after declaring its intention to leave. The Guardian reports that German officials were “very irritated” with Macron’s grandstanding. Macron tweeted on Wednesday that the Brexit distraction should be dealt with quickly since “we have a European renaissance to lead,” which is now going to be my default excuse for leaving any meeting that goes too long. Today in Today in Brexit: With the deadline extended and Parliament going on recess, the pace of Brexit news is likely to slow quite a bit, so we’re going to stop publishing this column on a daily basis. But never fear, watch for “This Week in Brexit” starting next Thursday on this very website. Days until next deadline: 204 Support our journalism

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was handed over to British authorities in London early Thursday morning. Once a self-styled freedom of information fighter, love him or hate him, Assange’s legacy has grown far more complicated since the 2016 election when Assange’s WikiLeaks apparatus operated as a clearinghouse for hacked information passed along from Kremlin-linked sources. Hacked DNC and Clinton campaign emails, for instance, were in effect laundered through WikiLeaks and then injected into the bloodstream of the American electorate. Trump knew the value—and potentially the source—of the information leaked to his benefit. But when asked about Assange’s arrest, the president clammed up.“I know nothing about Wikileaks. It’s not my thing,” Trump told reporters. “It’s not my deal in life.” That, of course, is not true. During the campaign, WikiLeaks was candidate Trump’s main squeeze and he its most high profile booster.

I masturbate while I listen to my neighbors having sex. Is that bad?,slate.com,Stoya,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/neighbor-sex-sounds-thin-walls-masturbate-advice.html,"My Wife Cheated—and Let Him Do Something She’d Never Let Me Do Dear How to Do It, I live in an apartment with stereotypical “thin walls” and with frequently noisy neighbors. This isn’t a complaint. I actually enjoy hearing them have sex and commonly masturbate while listening. I recently had a friend over, during which time we overheard the neighbors going at it. My friend commented that it must be so annoying to have neighbors like that, but I confessed that I enjoyed it and would sometimes masturbate to it. My friend was very offended by this—she thought it was a massive invasion of the neighbors’ privacy and equated it to hiding in their closet. My belief is that since the neighbors would understand the limited soundproofing of the building, they then concede the right to auditory privacy when they’re very loud. So as long as I am within the confines of my own apartment and not trying to actively record them or use some sort of sound-enhancing equipment, I have not invaded anyone’s privacy. Have I overstepped, or am I in the clear? —Won’t You Be My Neighbor Stoya : So I kind of just love this letter writer? Rich : Me too. Stoya : I feel like if anything the friend is projecting her own privacy or moral panic. Rich : If we take the reporting here as 100 percent accurate, the friend said “It must be so annoying to have neighbors like that.” Like what? Human? Capable of sexual pleasure and not caring if the people next door know it? I’ve got news for the friend: Those types are everywhere. Her house is surrounded. It’s like Night of the Living Dead , but with fornication. Stoya : Exhibitionists gonna exhibit and voyeurs gonna voye—which is absolutely not a word. Through some lucky happenstance, a pair that likes being loud lives next to someone who likes listening. It’s serendipity. Rich : Yes, a symbiotic relationship, like those fish that clean sharks’ teeth and don’t get eaten. Nature finds a way even in urban development. I feel like the writer, whose side I am on 100 percent, is really economical? Instead of turning on their computer, they’re just using the world around them to get off. Her house is surrounded. It’s like Night of the Living Dead , but with fornication. Stoya : They’re being truly green. Recycling the byproducts of others’ copulation. Rich : Look: Living on top of each other the way urban dwellers do can suck for reasons touched on in this very letter: namely, the lack of privacy. But to put it in perspective for a naysayer: If someone’s baking smells waft into your apartment, you might salivate. You might not be able to help that. If you get turned on from hearing sex that you have absolutely nothing to do with that would be going on with or without you, the same thing might happen. What can you do? Stoya : A delivery guy casually commented on how good the hallway smelled because of someone’s baking like two days ago. So that’s presumably a normal thing? Rich : It’s a totally normal thing. We overlap a lot in these close quarters, and it creates such resentment. Here’s the rare positive thing to come from living on top of one another. If more people were into the sex sounds of their neighbors, a place like New York might actually be friendlier. More people would be relieved, and presumably relaxed, at least. Stoya : We could heal the world with the sounds of sex. On the privacy question, where to draw the line, I can see where a problem might come in here. For instance, if this person were using sound-enhancing equipment, or if they were expressing gratitude to the loud couple, that might be different. Rich : Oh yeah, I agree. Recording it would be messed up, too. It almost has to happen exactly as it’s laid out—something un-ignorable and not conjured by the person who is enjoying it. It seems that this is something the letter writer is at the mercy of, much like weather, and that when their neighbors start to bang, it’s like 77 and sunny with no humidity. I guess the flip side, though, is how much responsibility do the neighbors have here? The person behind the other wall may not be as amused as our letter writer. Stoya : I’m just now, after 15 years of adult apartment sex, realizing that I had neighbors. Oops. Rich : Honestly, that’s the way to do it I think. That is how to do it, precisely, in fact. In big cities, it’s like, just part of the ambience. There are limits on how loud you should be at all hours, like anything else, but that’s it. Really, sometimes I worry I’m not loud enough! And that my neighbors are judging me like, “God, I guess he’s not getting any.” I’m just tender and passionate!!! Stoya : I’m imagining a world where neighbors do welfare checks when they aren’t hearing sex noises. It’s really great: Sex work is totally legal. Condom dispensers are on every street corner. You can get PrEP over the counter at Walgreens. Rich : Utopia. Stoya : This fantasy land rocks. I’m wondering what our writer should do regarding their friend. Rich : I think just don’t share stuff about sex with the friend. She doesn’t get it. Stoya : Simple, yet effective. Rich : Do you think there’s any getting through to her? Stoya : Probably not, or at least not until she’s calmed down. Rich : I think the only other potential issue to entertain briefly is whether our writer should alert the neighbors that they can hear them (or even that they’ve been listening). But like you said, I think they shouldn’t. Don’t disrupt the ecosystem. Stoya : I say absolutely not. If it were me—and let’s be real, it probably has been—I’d feel invaded because they said something. Or uncomfortably seen. Rich : Exactly, and it’d be terrible for the bystander to interfere with sex that’s bringing them so much pleasure by proxy. Stoya : Everything is balanced right now, so many beautiful orgasms are happening, and our writer seems to know what boundaries to stay on the proper side of. Why risk making it weird?"

White House wanted ICE to arrest undocumented immigrants and release them in sanctuary cities.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/white-house-trump-stephen-miller-ice-bus-undocumented-immigrant-sanctuary-cities.html,"For the Anti-Abortion Far Right, Six-Week Bans Are Just the Beginning Here’s a Trump White House immigration gambit that likely will shock, but not surprise you. The Trump administration, the Washington Post reported Thursday, came up with a cartoonishly villainous plan and then pressured immigration officials to carry out the Trumpian scheme of arresting undocumented migrants coming into the country and then busing them and releasing them on the streets of so-called sanctuary cities . The aim? Retaliation, of course, against political enemies and for not treating undocumented families like criminals. The Trump folks tried to make this plan a reality on multiple occasions over the last six months, according to Department of Homeland Security officials and email messages reviewed by The Post.
White House officials first broached the plan in a Nov. 16 email, asking officials at several agencies whether members of the caravan could be arrested at the border and then bused “to small- and mid-sized sanctuary cities,” places where local authorities have refused to hand over illegal immigrants for deportation… The attempt at political retribution raised alarm within ICE, with a top official responding that it was rife with budgetary and liability concerns, and noting that “there are PR risks as well.”
Senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller discussed the proposal with ICE, according to two DHS officials. Matthew Albence, who is ICE’s acting deputy director, immediately questioned the proposal in November and later circulated the idea within his agency when it resurfaced in February, seeking the legal review that ultimately doomed the proposal. “This was just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion,” the White House statement said. It was just a brainstorm!"

Surveys show that more and more couples, particularly younger ones, say the ideal relationship would be egalitarian. Research shows that egalitarian couples who fairly share work and home responsibilities are happier and healthier, and they have better sex. But are egalitarian partnerships possible, especially when U.S. work culture demands all-out devotion and women still carry the load as primary caregivers and household managers? We talk to an expert who studies egalitarian couples, from an Ethiopian immigrant nurse and Uber driver who shared caregiving because he had to, to the “trailing spouse” with big dreams in a military family, to Amy Nelson, founder and CEO of the Riveter, who had to quit her job as a corporate lawyer and enlist the help of family and friends, all in an effort to reach that egalitarian ideal.

"Uber plans global domination, but depends on just five cities for a quarter of its bookings",slate.com,Henry Grabar,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/uber-ipo-nyc-london-risks.html,"It’s More Obvious Than Ever What Republicans Want With Ilhan Omar If you’re thinking of investing in Uber when the company goes public this year, you might want to read the document the company published on Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining the potential of its business—and its risks. Some highlights: • Uber has grown very, very fast. The company notched 5 billion trips between its 2011 launch and September 2017—and another 5 billion in the subsequent 12 months. • The total value of Uber’s gross bookings, which counts all the money taken in by all of Uber’s services, a measure of the company’s scale, was $41.5 billion in 2018. More than 80 percent of that is from ridesharing, with most of the rest coming from Uber Eats. • 91 million people used Uber once a month at the end of 2018. • Uber’s business model isn’t all there: While there’s optimism about elements of the core business , the company lost more than $3 billion on operations in 2018, revenue growth slowed between Q3 and Q4, and there’s a possibility that the company might continue to offer big incentive payments to drivers for quite some time and never reach profitability. But one detail in particular caught my eye. About 24 percent of Uber’s bookings—all the money that customers pay through the app and in cash, including driver earnings—occur in just five cities: New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, and São Paulo. For a company that operates in more than 700 cities, including quite a few giants—Mexico City, Tokyo, Paris, Lagos, Hong Kong, Seoul, and Mumbai, to name a few—that concentration gives Uber a surprising vulnerability at the local level. And they know it. The filing reads:
We experience greater competition in large metropolitan areas than we do in other markets in which we operate, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas…An economic downturn, increased competition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater degree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. This vulnerability casts a new light on, for example, Uber’s 2015 humiliation of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio , when the company fought off the City Council’s proposed vehicle cap. That was a warning to other politicians, and a show of power, but it was also a vital business move. The company’s filing also mentions, as a cautionary tale, what happened afterward : Just three years later, the City Council approved minimum rates for drivers and a cap on the number of new ride-hail vehicles. The company also mentions its regulatory challenges in London and San Francisco. During Uber’s previous skirmishes with cities, I always thought the company’s huge reach and light footprint (very few local employees or inventory) gave them a lot of leverage. They could afford to play hardball with Austin, Texas, one week and San Antonio the next, with little impact on a business distributed so widely. The filing reveals that certain cities actually have a pretty strong negotiating position. So do the company’s drivers in those places. And its rivals. What appears to be a global, decentralized platform is in fact highly dependent on the whims of a few local politicians, drivers’ groups, and taxi cab unions that can engineer big chokepoints for the company—as London Mayor Sadiq Khan must have done when he revoked the company’s license in 2017. (They got it back last year.) Another example of the company’s vulnerability by concentration: 15 percent of the bookings pot comes from trips that begin or end at an airport. That might not be so surprising, since airports tend to be cab trips even for car commuters, and being a long way from town, produce high fares. But airports offer a preview of the changing municipal economics that could be coming for Uber. The airport in Charlotte, North Carolina, for example, made more money in 2017 from parking fees than it did from American Airlines. Parking accounted for more than a quarter of the airport’s revenue. As passengers shift to ride-hailing, airport revenues are declining . Airports are an easy place where public authorities can implement a fee on Uber rides to make up for the lost revenue. That same dynamic is set to play out in cities as well. Congestion pricing, which will soon exist in two of Uber’s biggest markets (New York and London), is just the first way that governments are exerting more fine-grained control over how cities raise money from automobile use. Uber actually fought for congestion pricing in New York, believing that the one-time fee on private cars entering Manhattan would work in its favor. It probably will. But that’s not the only way street pricing enabled by new technology could work: Cities can tax vehicles per mile traveled, or per hour in the congestion zone, or just slap a huge tax on Uber vehicles because they produce a lot of traffic and serve a relatively wealthy clientele. One thing the filing makes clear: It wouldn’t take a global movement to stress the company’s business model. A couple big-city mayors could do that all on their own."
The Southern Baptist Convention’s statement of principles on artificial intelligence.,slate.com,Ruth Graham,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/southern-baptist-convention-artificial-intelligence-evangelical-statement-principles.html,"Stem Cell Therapy Is Being Marketed to Autistic Kids. It Shouldn’t Be. Contemporary Christianity does not have a reputation as a vanguard of technological sophistication, or even enthusiasm. Sure, many churches have embraced smartphones’ abilities to spread their messages , for example. But Christian institutions are not often leading the big conversations about technology and culture. Traditional theist religions have “turned from a creative into a reactive force,” as historian Yuval Noah Harari put it in his 2016 book, Homo Deus . “They now mostly agonize over the technologies, methods and ideas propagated by other movements.” That reputation makes a statement on artificial intelligence released Thursday by the Southern Baptist Convention all the more intriguing. The SBC’s public-policy arm, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, spent nine months researching and writing “ Artificial Intelligence: An Evangelical Statement of Principles ,” and it has been signed by 68 prominent evangelical thinkers. The brief document is intended to respond to the “existential questions” raised by A.I. technology. It takes a strikingly optimistic tone in doing so. “This was created not out of fear, but out of an understanding that [A.I.] is a tool that God has given us,” said Jason Thacker, who headed the project at the ERLC. “Our hope is that for the first time in a really long time, the church can be proactively engaging in issues affecting society, rather than always responding and reacting.” The document opens on a note of hope, describing technology in general as a tool that can aid in the Christian mandate “to engage the world around us with the unchanging gospel message of hope and reconciliation.” In most areas, the document acknowledges both the promise and pitfalls of A.I. A section on bias, for example, states that A.I. is “inherently subject to bias and that these biases must be accounted for, minimized, or removed through continual human oversight and discretion.” Other articles—there are 12 total—address A.I. in arenas including medicine and war. (“Any lethal action conducted or substantially enabled by AI must employ human oversight or review.”) Each article ends with a list of Bible verses backing up its claims. (The first verse listed after the section on privacy is Exodus 20:15: “Thou shalt not steal.”) The document avoids referencing specific technologies because the drafting committee intends it to have a long shelf life as a guide and conversation starter within Christian institutions and beyond. “This is a statement of principles,” Thacker said, “not a statement of applications.” “This is a statement of principles, not a statement of applications.” — Jason Thacker The document does draw some firm lines. Article 1 declares that technology ought not to “be assigned a level of human identity, worth, dignity, or moral agency”—robots are not, and will never be, human. And unsurprisingly, Article 6 states that A.I. should not be used to pursue sexual pleasure and “should not intrude upon or substitute for the biblical expression of sexuality between a husband and wife”: It’s Adam and Eve, not Adam and HAL. Albert Antosca, a visiting scholar at Dartmouth College who has written about religion and technology for Slate , said the document would likely have to be adapted as technology advances. But overall, he said, “they’re making a lot of urgent and sophisticated points here. This doesn’t seem like a reactionary document.” The document’s signatories are a who’s who of mainstream conservative evangelicalism. They include the president of Focus on the Family, Jim Daly; the editor in chief of Christianity Today, Mark Galli; the president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, Gabriel Salguero; theologians Richard Mouw and Wayne Grudem; and many current and former Southern Baptist leaders and pastors. One signatory is a senior manager of technical program management at Amazon, but few others have obvious technological backgrounds; Thacker said that some signers have backgrounds or affiliations in the tech world, but opted to list other credentials. (Another notable imbalance: Just a handful of women signed.) American evangelicals are not the only faith group pondering the intersection of A.I. and religion. The Southern Baptist document appears just a few months after Pope Francis met with the president of Microsoft to discuss the ethical use of A.I., a topic he has raised publicly several times . The Vatican and Microsoft are co-sponsoring a prize for the best doctoral dissertation this year on the topic “artificial intelligence at the service of human life.” Antosca pointed out that the Baptist document has a deeply humanist perspective, emphasizing the distinctness of human life and the definitiveness of death. Elements of that perspective may put it somewhat at odds with organizations like the Christian Transhumanist Association , which ponders the possibility of “transcending” traditional humanity by extending life indefinitely, for example. Russell Moore, the head of the ERLC, has been critical of transhumanism , because of the theological belief that humans can only be fully “perfected” by faith in Jesus. He told a reporter in response to the first-ever Christian Transhumanism Conference in 2018 that “there could no more be a Christian transhumanist society than a carnivorous vegan society. The two are completely contradictory.” But Moore also said Christians shouldn’t be afraid of technology and that they should take such challenges seriously long before they’re a reality. That’s exactly what the new document aims to do."
Georgetown Students Vote to Add Fee for Slavery Reparations to Tuition,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/georgetown-students-reparations-fund-vote.html,"For the Anti-Abortion Far Right, Six-Week Bans Are Just the Beginning Undergraduate students at Georgetown University voted overwhelmingly Thursday in favor of paying an additional fee to go toward reparations for the descendants of slaves sold by Georgetown in the 19 th century, in what would, if approved by the university, be the first time an American university financially addresses its past as a slave-owning institution. The “Reconciliation Contribution” would charge students $27.20 per semester to go toward a fund, directed by a board of students and slave descendants, that would support projects in communities where some descendants of Georgetown’s slaves now live. But a student vote is not a binding measure that sets policy for the larger university, and the administration has not committed to the fund. Instead, the university has said it sees the vote as “valuable insight into student perspectives,” according to NBC News . According to the Georgetown University Student Association Elections Commission, which announced the results on Friday, of the nearly 60 percent of undergraduates who voted, 2,541 supported the measure and 1,304 opposed it. In 1838, two Jesuit priests serving as the university’s presidents sold 272 people enslaved by the Maryland Jesuits. The university was mired in debt at the time, and the profits from the sale—$115,000, or about $3 million today, according to the Washington Post —allowed the university to stay open. Proponents of the measure argued that the sale split apart families and sent some slaves South to horrific conditions on cotton and sugar plantations and that the university’s debt to those enslaved people, and their descendants, should be addressed. In 2016, Georgetown publicly recognized and apologized for its slave-holding past, and the university has since renamed the two buildings named after the Jesuit priests who organized the sale. It also gives preferential admissions (considering them as legacy admissions) to descendants of those 272 slaves. Four students are currently enrolled under that admissions policy, according to the Post.

How to scan your Airbnb for hidden cameras.,slate.com,Aaron Mak,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/how-to-scan-airbnb-hidden-camera-apps.html,"Stem Cell Therapy Is Being Marketed to Autistic Kids. It Shouldn’t Be. Over the weekend, news outlets reported that a New Zealand man named Andrew Barker had found a camera, hidden in a smoke detector, in his Airbnb that was livestreaming a feed of the living room. Barker was in Cork, Ireland, on a 14-month trip around Europe with his family when they checked into the rental house. Once they unpacked, Barker, who works in IT security, conducted a scan of the Wi-Fi network and found a camera the owner had not mentioned. He was then able to connect to the camera and view the live feed. The next day, the Barkers notified Airbnb, but he told the media that the company treated the incident like a canceled booking and just temporarily suspended the rooming post after a privacy investigation that the family found unsatisfactory. It wasn’t until Nealie Barker, Andrew’s wife, posted details of the incident on Facebook that Airbnb removed the listing and admitted that the original response “did not meet the high standards we set for ourselves.” This isn’t the first time that an Airbnb guest has discovered hidden recording devices in a rental unit. As Ars Technica reported , a woman found a remote-controlled camera in the living room of an apartment she had been planning to stay in for a month in 2013. She sued both Airbnb and the apartment’s residents, alleging that the camera had filmed her without clothing and recorded intimate conversations she had with her partner. In 2017, Florida police arrested a man for video voyeurism after his Airbnb guests reported finding a camera in the bedroom’s smoke detector. Airbnb’s terms of service dictate that hosts must disclose the presence of cameras to their guests. It’s unclear how common a practice it is for Airbnb hosts to hide cameras in their units, but if you’re particularly worried about prying eyes, there are imperfect ways to search for invasive devices. “Hidden cameras are probably rare but there are steps that an average user can take to increase their chances of finding one if one exists,” Barker wrote in an email to Slate. “Since our incident I will be performing network and ports scans at every accommodation we stay at.” That seems like a good practice. But it also requires some knowledge. When the story hit the internet, lots of people found themselves wondering how, exactly, to scan a network. The good news is that doing network and port scans for suspicious devices on the local Wi-Fi network doesn’t require as much technical knowledge as you might fear. Nor does it require expensive gear. Various apps that can perform the scans for you; Barker recommends Angry IP Scanner , NetworkMapper , and Network Scanner by First Row. In his Ireland Airbnb, Barker used Network Scanner for the network scan and NetworkMapper for the port scan, but most apps have both features. Check to see whether there are inexplicably two smoke detectors in the same room. Network scans generally allow users to view the IP addresses and manufacturers of devices connected to the Wi-Fi. In Barker’s case, the manufacturer of the hidden recording device was literally listed as “IPCAMERA.” Once you have the list, it’s a good idea to work backward. “You should in theory be able to tick off each device found through the scan to a device you are aware of and can physically see,” Barker wrote. If you see a device that looks suspicious, a port scan can help to identify its purpose. The scan will list the different ports for connecting to the device and the services they provide. The services will be listed as short codes; a Google search will generally reveal what the codes mean. For example, the code RDP indicates that users can remotely control the desktop of the computer. The codes RTMP and RTSP are for video streaming. These sorts of scans will only work if your device and the camera are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. If the camera is on a different network, or if it stores the footage on an internal hard drive, you’ll have a harder time finding it. For more details on how the scans work, check out the guide that Barker wrote for travelers after his Airbnb incident. Good old-fashioned sleuthing can also be helpful for finding cameras. Consumer-grade hidden cameras come embedded in a variety of different commonplace objects. Glance through the website for BrickHouse Security or the Amazon search results for the term “hidden camera” and you’ll find fake alarm clocks, USB chargers, buckets, lamps, stuffed animals, and bottles of Mountain Dew ($429–$519 on the website Covert Law Enforcement, if you’re curious) with discreet pinhole cameras. When you enter a room, you should check around to see if anything looks out of place. “These things tend to stand out like a sore thumb,” says Dan Tentler, founder and CEO of Phobos Group, a cybersecurity firm. For example, he recommends checking to see whether there are inexplicably two smoke detectors in the same room. Holding an object in your hands can also help to determine whether it’s fake. “If there’s a can of Mountain Dew randomly sat on the kitchen counter … and you walk up and pick up the can, you’re going to immediately know that it’s a hidden camera,” says Tentler. Look for reflections when you shine a light on objects, which may reveal the presence of a lens. If and when you find such a device, make sure to alert Airbnb or the hotel. You might also want to inform law enforcement, especially if you’re in a state where two-party consent is required for recording. “If you find a camera, take pictures of it,” says Tentler. “Make noise, post pictures of the thing on the internet, on Twitter.” "

Republicans kill Herman Cain's Fed nomination. What about Stephen Moore's?,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/republicans-kill-herman-cain-fed-nomination-stephen-moores.html,"Democrats Slam Trump After He Attacks Ilhan Omar With Graphic, Misleading 9/11 Video In a refreshingly sane turn of events, Herman Cain is now expected to pull himself from consideration for the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors thanks to opposition from Republican lawmakers, according to ABC News . Donald Trump announced last week that he intended to nominate the former Godfather’s Pizza CEO and failed presidential candidate for a seat at the central bank. But the idea has been received poorly on Capitol Hill, where four different GOP senators—Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Cory Gardner of Colorado, and Kevin Cramer of North Dakota— have now announced that they would not vote to confirm him, effectively dooming Cain’s candidacy before it was ever made official. Cain’s brief and abortive Fed bid seems to have been done in by a number of factors, all of which were readily foreseeable from the moment he emerged as a contender. Romney, who briefly faced off against Cain in 2012, focused on the former restaurant exec’s glaring lack of qualifications for the job and close political relationship to Trump (he campaigned for the president in 2016 and runs a political action committee dedicated to re-electing him). “I don’t think Herman Cain will be on the board of the Federal Reserve,” the freshman senator said earlier this week. “It’s important that the board be comprised of people who are academics, economists, and not people who are highly partisan.” (On Thursday, Romney was even more dismissive, joking with reporters that “if Herman Cain were on the Fed, you’d know the interest rate would soon be 9-9-9 .”) Cramer said that he was comfortable with Cain’s resume, but the sexual harassment allegations that capsized his presidential campaign more than seven years ago were a deal breaker. “His showmanship doesn’t bother me, his business experience I think is great, simplifying the tax code is fine by me, but character still does matter,” Cramer said. These are all perfectly good reasons to vote against Cain, a proto-Trumpian political novelty figure who was in fact utterly ill-suited for the Fed. He had no substantive experience with monetary policy and gave every indication that he would serve as a partisan lackey for the president if placed on the board. Cain spent most of his life as a vocal inflation hawk and gold bug, but after word of his potential candidacy emerged, he told reporters he would push the central bank to worry less about inflation, echoing Trump’s own line. But this leaves open an obvious question: If Republicans are willing to oppose Cain on both policy and character grounds, why not Trump’s other nominee, conservative economics commentator Stephen Moore? After all, Moore is toting almost all of the same baggage. He does not have an economics Ph.D. and has admitted that he is “not an expert” on monetary policy. Similar to Cain, he has swung from worrying about hyperinflation and endorsing the gold standard during the Obama years to criticizing the Fed for raising interest rates too quickly and raving about imaginary deflation once Trump entered office, a switch that can only be reasonably explained by his partisan leanings and transparent desire for hard-money policies that will slow the economy when Democrats are in power and soft-money policies that will juice it when Republicans run Washington. He is also, fundamentally, an operative: He ran the conservative Club for Growth in the early 2000s, which was dedicated to electing politicians who would cut taxes and regulations. He also advised Trump on economics, wrote a book hailing his policies, and has earned a paycheck lately by defending Trump as a TV talking head. He has his own tabloid-worthy character issues too: Moore owes more than $75,000 in back taxes and was held in contempt of court after failing to pay more than $300,000 in alimony and child support to his ex-wife. According to court records, the man also talked about having a mistress in front of his own children. Sure, Moore hasn’t been accused of groping women . But if qualifications and character both count at all these days, his nomination should sink too."
Game of Thrones’ end could kill the dream of global community.,slate.com,Kyle Mcauley,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-final-season-communal-viewing.html,"Tiger Woods Might’ve Just Pulled Off His Greatest Win Yet In 2008, David Benioff was promoting his latest novel when New York magazine’s Boris Kachka asked him what he was working on next. Benioff replied , “I’m doing a series at HBO. A crappy way of describing it would be The Sopranos in Middle Earth. I was a huge fantasy geek growing up. I was the Dungeon Master in my D&D game. Actually, most writers I know were the Dungeon Masters.”Benioff would later say that he regretted describing Game of Thrones in relation to the network’s just-ended megahit. Still, the self-described fantasy geek got his wish. He and his collaborator D.B. Weiss have become the biggest Dungeon Masters on Earth. Game of Thrones begins its swan song on Sunday. But you probably knew that, and even if you didn’t, the laments of the series’ many fans have been difficult to ignore . When HBO split the final season in two, viewers complained that the network was dragging things out. Now that the end is a month away, innumerable speculations about how the show will end serve as group therapy for fans grieving the inevitable. The television-watching public does not want Game of Thrones to end—because what would take its place? What fictional world could viewers lose themselves in, knowing others across the (real) world were losing themselves along with them? No matter who winds up victorious in Game of Thrones ’ finale, viewers will lose something precious: that sense that, whether at a bar’s watch party or on projectors in backyards or on the couch with family or alone in front of a touch screen, millions of others are doing the same thing at the same time, connecting viewers with those unseen others as much as to the characters on screen. Thrones ’ meteoric rise has been thoroughly documented . But beyond the ratings, the show has become omnipresent, vaulting past such piddling considerations as whether it’s still any good (eh) and into the fabric of our lives. (The latest “cross-licensed” giveaways from Major League Baseball include a bobblehead that dresses up taciturn pitcher Madison Bumgarner as the melodramatic Jon Snow.) Oversaturation has not dimmed interest: Episodes of the latest season have been pirated more than 1 billion times, notwithstanding the increasingly poor reviews . In personal essays and Quora threads , die-hard fans of George R.R. Martin’s source novels and Day 1 viewers continue to lament the show’s attempts to appeal to a broader viewership—which really is the purest proof that Thrones has become, if not democratic (it’s a show about a ruling class on premium cable, after all), then at least communalistic. No matter who winds up victorious in Game of Thrones ’ finale, viewers will lose something precious. Although Game of Thrones ’ reach has been broadened by the influence of social media, the idea of cultural consumers imagining themselves as an interconnected group is an old one. Social scientist Benedict Anderson argued in 1983 that the daily newspaper and the novel were the cultural technologies that allowed early 19 th -century citizens to group themselves into what he calls “imagined communities,” a feeling that led to the rise of what we now think of as nationalism. The newspaper connected a nation to the wider world, and the novel provided a nation with fictional ones. Game of Thrones ’ great promise was to somehow do both. On the eve of the show’s third-season premiere, Grantland’s Andy Greenwald wrote , “What we thought was an exercise in transforming a book into television may actually have helped turn television into a book.” Where 19 th -century printers had cheap pulp paper, 21 st -century TV networks have the internet. Fan sites and social media have kept Thrones in people’s lives well outside the show’s run. “We’re able to see how far-reaching Game of Thrones is throughout the world, that everyone’s watching the same thing together,” Vanity Fair critic Joanna Robinson told the Ringer’s Alyssa Bereznak . Of course, this isn’t literally everyone in the world— 2017 estimates put HBO’s subscriber base at 142 million, of which about a third is in the U.S. But the weekly flood of Twitter jokes and Instagram memes and Tumblr posts lets viewers think of themselves as part of a massive group, an experience that feels more precious as it becomes rarer. Underneath the laments about the show’s conclusion runs a deep anxiety about that feeling’s potentially permanent disappearance . Hardcore fans hate when their art goes mainstream because it makes them anonymous, and that is exactly what Game of Thrones ’ ascendance has done to its viewership. Like a nation’s imagined community, the show’s global public has found an increasingly intense shared identity—we’ll finish this thing even if they kill every last character we love—even as its numbers have ballooned. Sunday’s millions will watch the premiere as much to divine how the show will end as to discover how the creators will break our hearts with every plot twist and every death. With the shared agony of this masochistic catharsis comes a vast feeling of camaraderie. The sheer vastness of Thrones ’ fan base makes each individual fan more anonymous. Forget trying to stand out with a perfect fan theory or the hottest take. The show has seen every take known to the living and the dead. But anonymity in the face of Thrones ’ ubiquity isn’t a bad thing. In fact, after a disappointing seventh season and nearly two years of waiting, I’m convinced it’s the best remaining thing about the show. It might not measure up to other, more idiosyncratic favorites—I hold an unshakable belief that The Americans is the best series of the 2010s—but it’s a kind of relief to settle into a show that doesn’t feel like it’s targeting you, or that at least hides it well. (Remember that Netflix surveils its users as intensely as any tech giant , and that House of Cards was basically commissioned by an algorithm .) Though the pilot’s near-total reshoots famously left the showrunners wondering if the Starks and the Lannisters would ever make it to air, it seems obvious now that grown-up Lord of the Rings would appeal well outside “the demo.” Set against the proliferation of shows and services aimed at increasingly niche audiences, the insane extravagances of Game of Thrones feel like an embarrassing, rare, and affordable luxury. In our algorithmic age, there’s comfort in the crowd."
Supreme Court to Hear a Case That Could Put Countless Immigrants at Risk of State Arrest,slate.com,Samuel Garcia,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/kansas-v-garcia-supreme-court-undocumented-immigrant-id-theft.html,"The Assange Indictment Is a Shot Across the Bow of Press Freedom By the time many of us have just woken up, Manny, an undocumented immigrant I interviewed in South Texas, has already started his workday. (His name has been changed at his and his wife’s request.) Manny is a painter, and he has to start his work early in the morning to avoid the stifling South Texas heat. Manny has been in the United States for more than a decade, and he has been consistently employed since he arrived. During his time in the United States, he has never been arrested, he has started a family, and he has built a full life. Manny works five days a week at a job that an overwhelming majority of Americans would never even consider. Although he is otherwise law-abiding, he could not avoid breaking the law in order to get his job. When he got that job, he did not have the money to hire an immigration lawyer to help him get a work visa or citizenship. With no knowledge of the U.S. immigration system and no money to pay an attorney, it seemed like Manny only had two realistic options for employment: 1) continue working odd jobs that paid cash, or 2) use another person’s Social Security number to procure employment. But Manny had grown sick of under-the-table cash jobs because it was not uncommon for people to refuse to pay him after his work was complete. With a family to feed, he could no longer rely on odd jobs to make ends meet. So he did what a lot of other undocumented people in his position do: He used someone else’s Social Security number to fill in his I-9 form (a form that deals with employment eligibility verification ). Often the Social Security number used by an undocumented immigrant is one of a family member or close friend. Manny’s story is a common one, and the Supreme Court recently announced it would hear a landmark case centered on situations like his. Next term, the court will hear whether states can use information found in an I-9 to criminally prosecute those in Manny’s position, despite a federal statute that suggests they do not have that authority. The court’s ruling will have an enormous impact on the countless undocumented people in this country who use another person’s Social Security number to procure employment. It’s important to understand that undocumented immigrants in the United States have many ways of getting another person’s Social Security number, and most of those ways actually involve the consent of the person they are taking it from. Often the Social Security number used by an undocumented immigrant is one of a family member or close friend. Even if a person consents to another person using his Social Security number when filling out employment forms, using that Social Security number falsely can be illegal under federal law. Some individual states, however, have also made it a crime to use false Social Security numbers on those forms under their identity theft laws . The looming Supreme Court fight centers on such a state case. In Kansas, Ramiro Garcia, an undocumented immigrant who was working as a line cook, was arrested and convicted by state officials for identity theft after using someone else’s Social Security number to fill out his I-9 form. After appealing all the way up to the Supreme Court of Kansas, Garcia’s conviction was reversed based on the federal statute that seems to govern the form’s uses. The court ruled that the state’s identity theft prosecution “was expressly preempted” by federal law. The court explained that the language in 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(5) , the code that makes it a criminal and civil offense to hire undocumented immigrants, “explicitly prohibited state law enforcement use not only of the I–9 itself but also of the ‘ information contained in’ the I–9 for purposes other than those enumerated” in the statute. The enumerated purposes in that statute were limited to federal criminal prosecutions such as perjury, fraud in connection with identification documents, and visa forgery. State criminal prosecutions for identity theft are not included in those enumerated purposes. Kansas appealed the state Supreme Court’s decision, and last month the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear that appeal. Kansas v. Garcia is now likely to be one of the blockbuster cases of the court’s next term. The case deals with complex issues of federal preemption of state laws and of statutory interpretation. One bottom line, though, is that if the court decides to reverse the Kansas Supreme Court’s decision, it could put countless undocumented immigrants at risk of being prosecuted by state governments. The National Council of La Raza has reported that the majority of undocumented immigrants “pay income taxes using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) or false Social Security numbers.” If Kansas v. Garcia results in a reversal, then millions of undocumented people could have their I-9 forms and the information contained therein used against them in identity theft cases brought by individual states. People who work some of the most demanding manual labor jobs in this country could regress from earning an honest and consistent salary to working odd jobs for low and inconsistent pay. The industries that would be the hardest hit are some of the most integral for everyday American life. For instance, according to Pew , agriculture, food manufacturing, and construction are all industries in which unauthorized immigrants make up more than 10 percent of the workforce. Some argue that an affirmation of the Kansas Supreme Court’s decision will only encourage undocumented immigrants to continue falsifying information on I-9 forms. Others argue that a reversal of the decision will make finding work prohibitively difficult for hardworking immigrants who need to feed their families. Both sides seem to be right from a public policy perspective, which is a symptom of a bigger issue: The current immigration regime in the United States is broken. That is a problem that can’t be fixed by the courts. Support our journalism

Watch the Star Wars Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker trailer (VIDEO).,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/watch-the-star-wars-episode-ix-the-rise-of-skywalker-trailer-video.html,"Tiger Woods Might’ve Just Pulled Off His Greatest Win Yet The first trailer for Star Wars: Episode IX , the final episode of the current Star Wars trilogy, has arrived with a teasing glimpse into the end of the Skywalker saga. Arriving four years after the franchise returned with The Force Awakens , the ninth installment’s triumphant title has been revealed to be The Rise of Skywalker. The film will complete a nine-episode arc that began in 1977 with George Lucas’ original Star Wars film, A New Hope. According to director J.J. Abrams, The Rise of Skywalker is set around a year after the events of The Last Jedi , which ended with the eradication of nearly all of the Resistance and the death of Luke. Episode 9 will reunite new trilogy heroes Finn (John Boyega), Rey (Daisy Ridley), and Poe (Oscar Isaac), who all appear briefly in the teaser, as the Resistance prepares to rise again. The trailer also reveals an ominous glimpse of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), last seen attempting to strike out at Luke after declaring himself the Supreme Leader. Though, as expected, the trailer fails to reveal much in terms of plot, it does include several memorable moments that will stick with us until its release, including a tearful hug between Rey and Leia. As Luke declares in a voice-over at the end of the trailer: “No one’s ever really gone.” Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

Rereading the first-season reviews of Game of Thrones.,slate.com,Inkoo Kang,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-first-season-reviews-critics.html,"Which Game of Thrones God Is the Best to Worship? Game of Thrones might well be the last TV show that we watch together , but the HBO series, which returns Sunday for its eighth and final season, certainly didn’t begin that way. Though eagerly anticipated by fans of George R. R. Martin’s novels (which the author had not believed to be adaptable for the screen), the first season of Game of Thrones was met with lingering snobbery toward the fantasy genre by some critics and enormous pressure to succeed The Sopranos , The Wire , and Deadwood in HBO’s lineage of network-defining critical darlings. Of course, it became something much bigger: a cultural juggernaut that heralded new norms in TV storytelling, inspired countless copycats, and remained singularly epic in both scope and popularity. Did critics see the colossus coming? It’s worth traveling back to a time when Game of Thrones was just another series premiere and revisiting the show’s original reviews from 2011, partly to see if the show’s initial episodes presaged its greatness (and its many faults), and partly to see what reviewers may have missed about its appeal. The show’s chattiness and its confusing tangle of storylines—both cited by critics as unnecessary hurdles for the audience—have become two of the show’s signature lures. Other reviews clocked the show’s chronic mishandling of race and gender issues, while committing faux pas of their own—such as the infamous head-scratcher of a New York Times pan that implied that fantasy is “boy fiction.” (According to HBO, the show’s enormous viewership is roughly evenly split, 55 percent men and 45 percent women.)

South Korean women continue to face societal stigma for having an abortion.,slate.com,Tamara Evdokimova,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/abortion-south-korea-legalized.html,"Big Flightless Bird With Deadly Claws Kills Owner in Florida South Korea’s Constitutional Court overturned a 65-year-old ban on abortion in a 7–2 vote on Thursday. “Criminalizing a woman who undergoes abortion of her own will,” the ruling read, “limits the right of self-determination of the woman.” The court called on the Korean parliament to revise the law by 2020. The abortion ban was adopted in 1953, following the 1950–53 Korean War. Women who terminated their pregnancy could face up to one year in prison or a fine of 2 million won (about $1,750). Doctors who performed abortions risked up to two years in prison, although the Korean government rarely prosecuted medical professionals under this law. Some exceptions have been introduced over the years, permitting abortion in cases of rape and incest, when the mother’s life is at risk, and when there is a high risk of hereditary disorders. Despite these allowances, however, abortion under exceptional circumstances requires spousal consent and is always illegal after 24 weeks. According to the Center for Reproductive Rights , South Korea’s restrictions are on par with those in Poland, Thailand, and Saudi Arabia. In Poland, for example, abortion is legal only in cases of incest, rape, or fetal impairment, and requires parental consent for minors. Similarly, in Thailand, abortion is permitted in cases of rape, fetal impairment, or if the pregnancy endangers a woman’s health. Saudi Arabia requires a woman to obtain parental and/or spousal consent and allows terminations only to save the mother’s life. Overall, countries in North America and Europe and Central and Eastern Asia have the most liberal abortion laws in the world, with South Korea and Poland as the two notable exceptions. The court ruling comes at a time when South Korea’s fertility rates have hit historic lows. In the early 1970s, when exceptions to the abortion ban were first introduced, the fertility rate averaged at 4.1 children per woman. In fact, the Korean government was so worried about its increasing population that it offered men exemptions from mandatory military service in exchange for free vasectomies. By 2015, the average was just 1.2 children per woman, one of the lowest in the world. As early as 2009, the government became concerned with declining birth rates, launching a public campaign to discourage abortion, with subway ads proclaiming that “With abortion, you are aborting the future.” Perhaps in response to the government’s concern or due to other factors, abortion rates in Korea have been steadily falling . In 2008, the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs counted 241,411 abortions, whereas in 2017, the number dropped to only 49,764. Of course, those numbers do not account for the many abortions that go unreported. Beyond health risks associated with illegal abortions, fear of retribution has been a major issue for Korean women, with cases of husbands and boyfriends using women’s secret abortions to blackmail them. About 10 percent of Korean women who had an abortion reported using illegally obtained medications to induce a miscarriage, rather than seeking a medical operation. There’s some concern about the unsanctioned use of abortion medication, however, as women often have no way of knowing if pills they’ve purchased illegally are properly manufactured and safe to use, thus increasing their risk of health complications. Contrary to the conservative stance of their government, the majority of Korean women were in favor of overturning the abortion ban before Thursday’s court ruling. In 2018, 75 percent of women believed that the law punishing women for receiving abortions should be amended.Forty-nine percent wanted to specifically amend the rules surrounding spousal consent. Women’s rights groups in Korea have been pressuring the government to uplift the abortion ban for a few years now. The Constitutional Court has already considered amending the anti-abortion legislation back in 2012, when it split 4–4, leaving the law intact. In 2017, more than 200,000 South Koreans signed a petition calling for the legalization of abortion. When South Korea’s Ministry of Health and Welfare classified abortion as an unethical medical practice, activists staged protests in Seoul, demanding an end to the anti-abortion law. Finally, a gynecologist charged with conducting 69 abortions between 2013 and 2015 brought her case before the Constitutional Court in hopes of overturning the 2012 ruling—this time, it worked. Abortion remains a hush-hush topic in South Korean society: A baby in South Korea is considered to be 1 year old at birth , implying that life begins at conception, and unmarried pregnant women continue to face societal stigma. When the Constitutional Court moved to consider the abortion ban, stories of hardships that South Korean women faced after getting an abortion proliferated in the media. One woman told the Japan Times how a doctor openly judged her—24, unmarried—while performing an abortion and dismissed her physical discomfort during the procedure because she’d already “done everything.” Another remembered taking a traditional Korean brew at 21 in hopes of inducing a miscarriage, enduring extreme pain, and being forced to travel to a clinic to receive an illegal abortion when the herbs failed. While this week’s court ruling is a major victory for women and women’s rights activists in South Korea, the country still has a long way to go when it comes to eliminating cultural stigma and normalizing abortion as a valid choice.

Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker is not as exciting because the franchise never ends.,slate.com,Sam Adams,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/star-wars-nine-skywalker-trailer.html,"Tiger Woods Might’ve Just Pulled Off His Greatest Win Yet “No one’s ever really gone.” When Luke spoke those words to Leia in Star Wars: The Last Jedi , tears sprang to my eyes. The character’s warning to his sister about his imminent death doubled as a farewell to actress Carrie Fisher, who died after filming for the movie was complete. But when I heard those same words in the trailer for The Rise of Skywalker , the ninth and (for now) final installment in the generation-spanning series, my eyes rolled instead of misting up. It was a foregone conclusion that Luke, who died—or whatever it is one calls the disintegration of his corporeal form —would return in the last movie, just as Alec Guinness did after Obi-Wan was struck down in the first Star Wars . But the trailer confirms that despite Fisher’s death, Leia, too, will be back, thanks to unused footage from The Force Awakens . (Director J.J. Abrams reassured fans at Friday’s Star Wars Celebration that she will not appear as an uncanny digital doppelgänger as she did in Rogue One ). And though Disney CEO Robert Iger said that the Star Wars movies will enter “a bit of a hiatus” after the release of The Rise of Skywalker , he also announced that that the first episode of spinoff series The Mandalorian will be available on the company’s streaming service, Disney+, when it launches on Nov. 12, with another, yet-untitled series focusing on Rogue One ’s Cassian Andor to follow in 2021. More films and series, including a new trilogy from The Last Jedi ’s Rian Johnson, are purportedly on the way, fulfilling the promise of Adam Rogers’ Wired article, “ You Won’t Live to See the Final Star Wars Movie .” Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

Iger talks about the “hiatus” like it’s a silent moment of respect, but it’s more like a pit stop, a brief pause to kick the tires before getting back on the track and speeding around in circles. If you love Star Wars , as I sometimes do , this ought to be good news. You get a Star Wars , and you get a Star Wars , and you get a Star Wars ! But seeing the first live-action Star Wars TV show listed alongside the likes of High School Musical: The Music: The Series —a title that looks more like an old-school SAT question than a forthcoming Disney+ offering—makes it feels like just another brand extension, about as thrilling as a new variety of Snickers. Part of what made the Star Wars trilogies so exciting was their sheer improbability, but it’s now more difficult to imagine a world in which they stop churning out Star Wars content than one in which it goes on forever. I wish Solo had been better, but there’s a strange kind of relief in its relative failure , which proves that it’s possible for a Star Wars movie to be bad, or at least mediocre, enough to scuttle its clearly prepared-for sequel. When the new trilogy was announced, I was thrilled that my daughter would have a Star Wars to call her own. Now I hope that someday she’ll know a world without Star Wars —at least for long enough that the next time it comes back, it’ll be a surprise and not an inevitability. Support our journalism

"The Trump administration just settled a suit that could reunite 2,700 immigrant families.",slate.com,Dahlia Lithwick,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-administration-settled-central-american-minors-parole-program-lawsuit.html,"Fox’s Wallace Only “Comfortable” Playing Five Seconds of Trump’s “Horrible” Omar Video I n a week that opened with the White House “ cleaning house” at the Department of Homeland Security and ended with the president openly threatening to release detained immigrants into so-called sanctuary cities to “punish” his immigration reform foes, some good news has come in a major legal challenge to another secretive and “tough” immigration policy. On Friday afternoon, the government signed a settlement agreement in a massive class-action suit challenging the Trump administration’s termination of the little-known Central American Minors (CAM) parole program . As a result of that agreement, almost 3,000 vulnerable kids will have a chance to be reunited with their families in the United States. The Obama-era CAM program was created in 2014 , following news of a surge of tens of thousands of unaccompanied children fleeing violence in the Northern Triangle countries El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The initiative, intended to create a safe and lawful alternative to dangerous solo treks through Mexico, allowed lawful immigrants who lived in the U.S. to apply for refugee status on behalf of their children younger than 21 and certain eligible relatives. The secretary of homeland security was given case-by-case discretion to parole in foreign nationals for “urgent humanitarian reasons” or “significant public benefit” for those who perhaps didn’t meet the stringent definition of refugee but nevertheless merited consideration on the grounds of humanitarian relief. These eligibility determinations were made when the minors were still in their home countries so as to avoid dangerous solo travel via Mexico. Humanitarian parole would allow them to spend two years in the United States, without a pathway to citizenship. The program stuttered to a stop almost as soon as Donald Trump took office . In response, a lawsuit was brought in June on behalf of the families of 12 minors whose lives were in limbo as the program languished. The suit , filed by the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), one of the groups that first challenged the Trump administration’s travel ban, was on behalf of the more than 2,700 children who had already applied before the program was terminated but had received no answer. Many of these applicants had already gone through months or years of processing and had already been approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for relocation pending final medical and security checks. But the program was shuttered, first in secret, without any notice to the applicants, and then formally in August of 2017 with an unexplained mass rescission of conditional approval for parole status for nearly 3,000 children. Worse still, the plaintiffs alleged that USCIS had continued to accept money from applicant families—including $400 for DNA tests, $100 or more for medical exams, and $1,400 for each child’s plane ticket—long after the program had been decommissioned. In effect, they argued, the program was still taking applications on its website and accepting payments while rescinding everyone’s conditional approval en masse. This willingness to sign off on a settlement agreement suggests yet again that this border crisis is less about public safety than ugly political signaling. In December, a federal magistrate judge found that the cancellation of the program was illegal under the Administrative Procedure Act, which delineates how federal agencies propose and establish new regulations. Then, early last month, the same federal magistrate judge in San Francisco ordered the administration to restart the processing of CAM applications for those who had already been conditionally approved, finding that the government’s action was causing irreparable harm to the plaintiffs by preventing their children from escaping life-threatening danger. She gave the government until March 21 to begin processing these children at late stages of processing again and explicitly ordered that “DHS may not adopt any policy, procedure, or practice of not processing the beneficiaries or placing their processing on hold en masse” and “must process the beneficiaries in good faith.” On Friday afternoon, the Department of Homeland Security entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, in which USCIS now agrees to process the approximately 2,700 people who had been conditionally approved for parole prior to the CAM parole program’s termination and agrees to process them under the pre-termination standards. That means that, for the families who have been waiting for years to be reunified in the U.S. with children facing horrific danger and violence in Central America, at least the process of attempting to reunify now begins again. For S.A., the plaintiff whose name is on the IRAP lawsuit, that will finally mean the possibility of reunification with her daughter and small grandson. S.A. has lived lawfully in the U.S. since 2001 under a program designed to help citizens of countries experiencing armed conflict. She works for a lice-removal company in San Francisco. Her youngest daughter, who still lives in San Salvador, has been threatened with brutal gang violence. She and her baby son had been cleared in February of 2017 to travel to the United States and had paid nearly $5,000 for their flights, DNA tests, and other processing requirements at that time. Their approval was rescinded when the CAM program was canceled. Similarly situated teens in the lawsuit, fleeing from horrific gang violence and sexual abuse, will now at minimum see their applications processed as promised. For Linda Evarts, the attorney with IRAP who litigated this suit, the agreement with the Trump administration is an unalloyed win for reunification of families: “We are so pleased that after many years apart our clients will finally have the opportunity to reunite with each other in safety. These families belong together here in the United States, and we are hopeful this settlement will allow for their swift reunification.” Given the Trump administration’s current stance that holds that all migrants, but especially those from Central America, are de facto criminals and rapists and gang members, this willingness to sign off on a settlement agreement suggests yet again that this border crisis is less about public safety than ugly political signaling .
