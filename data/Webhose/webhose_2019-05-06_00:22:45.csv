New Zealand initiates bill to Prohibit guns,www.dailypolitical.com,Trevor Kearing,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailypolitical.com/2019/04/06/new-zealand-initiates-bill-to-prohibit-guns.html,"Zacks: Brokerages Expect Perspecta Inc (PRSP) Will Announce Quarterly Sales of $1.08 Billion New Zealand initiates bill to Prohibit guns New Zealand initiates bill to Prohibit guns - Filed Under - by Trevor Kearing Tweet
New Zealand’s authorities on Monday introduced a statement it intends to rush into law that would prohibit weapons that a gunman utilized to kill 50 people at two mosques’ kinds.
Police Minister Stuart Nash explained that if lawmakers pass the bill as anticipated, the law would take effect April 12, less than a month following the March 15 strikes. Plans for law changes were first announced by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern from the days following the attacks, when the government imposed an immediate ban on the sales of weapons. Get alerts:
The bill has bipartisan support and may pass by a vote for 120 lawmakers. “These are firearms that are made to kill people,” Nash said.
He said among the weapons has been an AR-15 style rifle, and that the weapons that the gunman would be banned.
The bill would prohibit”military-style” semi-automatic firearms and high-capacity magazines. It would also ban semi-automatic shotguns that may be fitted with magazines and pump-action shotguns that can hold more than five rounds.
The bill would not ban guns used by farmers and hunters, such as semi automatic .22-caliber or smaller guns that hold around 10 rounds, or shotguns that hold as many as five rounds.
Nash said the gunman had abandoned a legacy of despair, pain and injury. He said the gunman was able to buy semi-automatic firearms and high-capacity magazines then put them together to create military-style weapons.
“The loophole this terrorist utilized to kill 50 people was totally unacceptable,” Nash said. “We are shutting that down.”
The bill would also impose penalties. Lawmakers plan to introduce laws later in the calendar year, for example, creation of a register to monitor firearms.
The government plans to compensate owners of prohibited firearms in a buyback scheme which will cost around 200 million New Zealand dollars ($137 million). An amnesty will provide folks until Sept. 30 to hand over banned weapons.
Nash reported that so much, their guns have been handed in by about 200 folks but most are awaiting the buyback scheme’s details, which have not yet been announced.
Conservative lawmaker David Seymour alone has voiced reservations regarding the bill, mainly the rate at. Even a spokesman said the Seymour was not yet comfortable enough with all the bill to say which way he would vote.
There’ll be several exemptions from the ban such as a few pest controls, army personnel and police officers. Latest News"
Japan says Title for new era of Naruhito will be’Reiwa’,www.dailypolitical.com,Stacy Sanders,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailypolitical.com/2019/04/06/japan-says-title-for-new-era-of-naruhito-will-bereiwa.html,"Zacks: Brokerages Expect Perspecta Inc (PRSP) Will Announce Quarterly Sales of $1.08 Billion Japan says Title for new era of Naruhito will be’Reiwa’ Japan says Title for new era of Naruhito will be’Reiwa’ - Filed Under - by Stacy Sanders Tweet
The title of the era of Japan’s soon-to-be-emperor Naruhito will be”Reiwa,” or ordering harmony, the government announced Monday.
Emperor Akihito is stepping on April 30 — the very first abdication in 200 years bringing his era of”Heisei” to an end. May 1, the era takes effect. Get alerts:
Abe, who said that the two letters were taken from a poem about blooming plum blossoms,” said the age name means that civilization is born and cultivated as the folks”superbly care about each other.” The letters obtained in the 1,200-year-old Japanese verse novel defines”Japan’s special national identity, for example eternal history, its own aromatic tradition and four seasons that bring amazing nature, and ardently hands down them to another production,” Abe said. He said the government picked the title Reiwa”together with hopes of making Japan a country where every individual can achieve dreams, such as the plum blossoms that bloom beautifully after the winter to signal the beginning of the spring.”
The choice was a break out of almost 1,400 decades of drawing age names, or”gengo,” from using Chinese classics. It was kept strictly secret ahead of the statement of Monday. Abe said choosing the title from the only Japanese book that represents the rich culture and tradition of Japan is suitable.
“We expect (the era name) will likely be widely accepted by both people and deeply rooted as part of their everyday lives,” Suga told colleagues in first announcing the name, composed in two Chinese characters in dark ink calligraphy to a white background.
The statement allows just a month ahead of the change for government, companies and other industries to adapt to the shift that affects many parts of Japan’s society, even though the machine is not compulsory and the emperor has no political authority beneath Japan’s postwar constitution.
On Japanese and Chinese literature, Abe appointed a panel of experts Underneath the 1979 era name law to nominate two to five names for top officials to select from. The names needed to meet strict standards, being simple to write and read but formerly or not commonly used for an era name.
Japanese media scrambled for scoops. Rumors comprised”Ankyu,” which utilizes the exact identical Chinese character since in Abe’s family name.
There had been speculation that Abe government, often hawkish on China matters, could pick the name from a document .
The title selection process started in mid-March if Suga asked a couple of scholars that were unidentified to nominate two.
Nominations were presented in a closed-door assembly that comprised nine outside experts from various locations, such as Nobel Prize-winning stem-cell scientist Shinya Yamanaka and novelist Mariko Hayashi, to show their views and narrow down the selection from the Cabinet before final acceptance.
While a growing number of Japanese prefer the calendar across the network in a cosmopolitan and highly digitalized society, the age name remains widely used in government and company documents. Elders use it to identify their productions.
Guessing and discussing era titles was not considered a taboo this time since Akihito is abdicating. Era name change can also be a period for many Japanese to reflect on the incoming and outgoing decades.
Akihito’s era of Heisei, which means”attaining peace,” was the first without a warfare in Japan’s modern history, but can also be remembered as missing years of economic deflation and natural disasters.
Heisei was the very first era name decided by the administration under the constitution, where the emperor was stripped of political authority and also had no say over the choice.
Companies are being created by era title changes for both the incoming and the outgoing. Anything dubbed”prior to Heisei” attracts Akihito lovers, while some are waiting to submit marriage certificates or submitting other official registration until the new age begins. Analysts say the age change that enlarges the”golden week” holiday to 10 times on May 1 can hamper tourism along with other recreational spending.

Those wanting a close UK-EU relationship should beware Brussels' opaque law-making processes | BrexitCentral,brexitcentral.com,Lee Rotherham,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://brexitcentral.com/wanting-close-uk-eu-relationship-beware-brussels-opaque-law-making-processes/,"Lee Rotherham | 7th April 2019 - Alastair MacMillan | 7th April 2019 - Those wanting a close UK-EU relationship should beware Brussels’ opaque law-making processes Written by
Dr Lee Rotherham is Director of think tank The Red Cell , Executive Director of Veterans for Britain and Chairman of the appeal to establish a Museum of Sovereignty . He was Director of Special Projects at Vote Leave. Share
The Council of the European Union doesn’t reach decisions by magic. A cascade of rules and laws flows through over 150 specialised working parties and committees known as the ‘Council preparatory bodies’.
Their remit is as varied and collectively extensive as the competences of the EU that they cover. Some, like the Political and Security Committee or the EU Military Committee Working Group, discuss material sufficiently sensitive as to make even their agendas classified. But the output of the remainder – from the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration (HLWG) to the Trade Policy Committee (Services and Investment) via the Codex Alimentarius Working Party (CCMAS) – at least give some early indicators as to the legislative material that will emerge down the line for those that follow their paper trails.
Many cover international meetings to which post-Brexit UK may soon be sending its own reps with negotiating powers, crafting international rules at source. Others deal with the output of Euroquangos like the EMCDDA, or EU offshoots like the European Soil Partnership. Parliamentarians will have heard of few, and quite possibly none of them. Perhaps this is convenient for democratic sensitivities. Even by this stage, long after the Commission’s craftwork in framing the policy has been in play, it will often already be too late to inject much democratic oversight into the draftsmanship.
Their discussions and negotiations cover scores of items every week. A tiny sample representation taken from agendas from just the last few days includes: A proposal changing VAT in an SME scheme Conclusions on cross-border circulation of European audiovisual works with an emphasis on co-productions A proposal for harmonising excise duties on alcohol and alcoholic beverages A mooted regulation on minimum requirements for water reuse The European Union Strategic Approach to Pharmaceuticals in the Environment An EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes (of enduring interest to OCTs) A text on agricultural aspects of a strategic vision for a climate neutral economy Draft conclusions on tourism as a driver for growth, jobs and social cohesion A discussion of a report on EU macro-regional strategies New rules on class action over consumer rights A mid-term review of the EU Forest Strategy A document on High Quality Early Childhood Education and Care Systems The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sport dimension Proposed changes to rail passengers’ rights and obligations A draft on patient safety in the EU’s hospital and ambulatory sector EU Industrial Policy: Vision for 2030
If Westminster’s view of the Council’s activities is at best peripheral, then consider the level of accountability MPs hold over the Commission’s comitology process. In 2017, there were 267 Commission versions of these committees feeding into the Council, each with even less insight from Parliament. MEPs themselves barely get a rare glimpse before any draft emerges. And this is before we even reflect on the prior role and drafting input of the Commission’s Advisory Bodies and Expert Groups that inform and shape the first drafts…
The nature of the EU law-making process is opaque, inherently and systemically undemocratic and a prime reason underpinning why people voted to “take back control”. This factor should inform our decisions in the next few days.
For as long as the UK remains closely attached, or subject to, the EU’s rule-making processes, then the output of these committees will be important, as will the mandates and policy aspirations of the Commission officials and their own advisory groups that feed them too.
Under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement (WA), transitionally the UK will have marginal input and no veto over many of these laws as they are being formed. The Withdrawal Agreement’s text is almost designed to read as a mechanism for humiliating civil servants posted to UKREP. Old hands will need grief counselling.
Whether or not the WA is passed, even more critical, however, will be the nature of the end treaty. A bad one, minimising change, carries with it the prospect not merely of enduring UK administrative inertia but also of retaining the democratic void.
An EU deal that leaves the UK in a so-called “Norway Plus” arrangement, for example, bolts the country inside a heavy regulatory union and customs establishment with marginal and tangential roles for MPs. Such a model also removes the opportunity to redress a great deal of the red tape and gold plating issues that have hampered previous governmental attempts at regulatory reform. Our inability to reshape bad laws because they are in civil service speak “out of scope” – ‘off limits’ because they are drafted at EU level – has been Whitehall’s guilty secret for years. A study of this problem and suggested reforms can be found here . The “Norway” route does little to fix them.
So MPs, as they consider what type of Brexit they are voting on, might usefully reflect on their own future relationship with the true law drafters. Rather than simply bandy challenges to the Government asserting some new-found but ill-understood sense of primacy, they might reflect on what their vote means in terms of genuinely retrieving power from the ‘legislative upstream’ where it presently sits.
They might consider whether they are in effect rebelling just to preserve their current second-class status, rubber-stamping the output of a remote world so little understood by our lawmakers; the obscure meeting rooms and barter chambers of EU comitology.
In any event, I invite the reader simply to review the list and range of these law-scripting committees at Council and Commission level , and for MPs to reflect on the proportion of their output that their vote will affect. "

Saturday Night Live opened up its latest show with a cold open skewering “touchy-feely” former Vice-President Joe Biden.
Last week’s cold open was unusually short , this week, however, lacked such brevity clocking in at nearly 7 minutes and featuring a bumbling Biden who just didn’t seem to get what was wrong with his handsy antics.
“I’m a hugger, a kisser, and a little bit of a sniffer,” Jason Sudeikis as Biden says at the beginning of the sketch in response to a concerned aide bringing up “all the touchy-feely stuff.”
He added: “The last thing I ever want to do is offend anyone.”
A sensitivity training consultant — played by Kate McKinnon — is then brought in to try to get through to him.
SNL’s Biden gets creepily close, as he does to all the female Democrats the consultant brings in to express their concerns.
“Well, ideally when you meet a female stranger for the first time there would be no kisses or hugs of any kind,” the consultant advises him.
“That’s a human connection,” SNL Biden responds. “That’s my whole thing.”
At one point, clearly frustrated by her attempts to teach him, the consultant laments, “nothing is getting through to you.”
“So let’s hug it out, America, what do you say?” Sudeikis as Biden says towards the end of the sketch. “Biden and some woman in 2020, right? We can do this.”
“Are you making an official announcement right now?” the consultant asks, prompting the “Live from New York” that ends each open.

CNN’s Van Jones ended his show on Saturday by talking about the death of Nipsey Hussle and asking what is wrong “with all of us.”
“I want to acknowledge that rapper Nipsey Hussle was gunned down in Los Angeles this week,” Jones said. “I don’t even have words for this tragedy.”
He then called the rapper an “extraordinary young brother” who was “doing everything” you would want a young star to do.
“This was not gang related,” Jones made clear, referring to Hustle’s death.
However, he added: “All too often it is. Bloods versus Crips. Blue bandanas versus red.”
That is when Jones made it clear that the madness is not only on the streets among gangs.
“Who today has the authority to tell anybody to stop the madness because even among the elites, it’s the same thing — blue versus red, blue Democrats versus red Republicans,” Jones said. “Using their weapons to kill each other off as best they can with more sophisticated means and methods.”
“Both sides got their reasons for their righteousness,” he further added. “But if they keep going, we are going to have national self-destruction. Keep that in mind.”
Jones then concluded: “Peace and prayers to Nipsey’s family. But let’s not point fingers at the hood. What’s wrong with those people? What’s wrong with all of us?”

Trump’s lawyer calls Democrats’ demands for tax returns “a gross abuse of power”,www.vox.com,Amanda Sakuma,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/6/18298327/trump-tax-returns-audit-house-democrats,"Flipboard Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images For more than four years, President Donald Trump has refused to release his federal income tax returns. Friday, his attorney said the president plans to continue doing so, despite pressure from House Democrats to make the returns public. In a letter to the Treasury Department, Trump’s attorney William Consovoy called on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to reject a request from the House Ways and Means Committee to release the president’s personal and business tax returns. “It would be a gross abuse of power for the majority party to use tax returns as a weapon to attack, harass, and intimidate their political opponents,” Consovoy wrote on Friday . “Once this Pandora’s box is opened, the ensuing tit-for-tat will do lasting damage to our nation.” Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, demanded Trump’s returns on Wednesday , following months of a slow and meticulous start to a number of investigations into the Trump White House by Democrats newly in control of the House of Representatives. Neal wants six years worth of Trump’spersonal federal income tax returns and returns for business entities tied to his name, spanning 2013 through 2018. The chairman set an April 10 deadline for returns’ release. The president’s legal team made clear this week that it has every intention to fight House Democrats tooth and nail over the issue. The team has already indicated a willingness to bring the issue all the way to the Supreme Court. Trump’s argument for why he shouldn’t release his returns keeps changing Trump defied decades of precedent in refusing to release his returns — every modern presidential party nominee has made their tax returns public at one point or another. The president has justified his refusal to follow suit, but his justifications keep changing. Over the course of his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump waffled over whether he’d actually make his returns available to the public. Before formally announcing his campaign, Trump promised conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt he would release his returns should he run for president. The president then punted on the issue after he formally declared his candidacy months later, saying in August 2015 that he’d release them “ at some point .” Trump teased of a big tax return reveal during the Republican primary season. But as Vox’s Andrew Prokop notes , Trump’s storyline started to shift around the time he edged closer to clinching the party’s nomination. Trump began arguing that he was barred from releasing his returns because he was being audited by the IRS. Only after the audit was finished would he be able to make the returns public, he claimed. Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit, no problem! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 27, 2016 Tax experts, including at the IRS , debunked these claims as bogus. Nevertheless, it’s a justification Trump continues to use today. “Until such time as I am not under audit, I will not be doing that, thank you,” Trump said this week, according to Politico . House Democrats are now trying to use the audit process against the president. They’re using a somewhat novel approach, working to obtain Trump’s returns by checking on whether the IRS is properly auditing his taxes. In a letter to the IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig on Wednesday, Neal wrote that although the agency has historically audited the tax returns of sitting presidents and vice presidents, little is known about the process. The chairman argued the House needed the returns in order to fulfill Congress’ duty in conducting “oversight of departments and officials.” Trump’s legal team responded by calling on the Justice Department to weigh in; it also asked the Treasury Department to deny Neal’s request until the DOJ submits a formal legal opinion. As New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman points out, central to the attorneys’ argument is a claim that Trump is both a regular citizen and sitting president. On one hand, they argue he is a private citizen and that Neal’s committee has “no power to conduct its own examination of the individual taxpayers.” On the other hand, Trump has used his authority as president to fill federal agencies with political appointees, including Rettig. As Vox’s Emily Stewart reports, before he led the IRS, Rettig said he wouldn’t advise Trump to release his returns while being audited. “Would any experienced tax lawyer representing Trump in an IRS audit advise him to publicly release his tax returns during the audit? Absolutely not,” Rettig said in 2016. Trump lawyers have consistently elevated the concept of his rights as a private citizen when critics have raised questions about aspects of his conduct in office. Most extreme example of him trying to be two things at once. https://t.co/BtvbWdhatO — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) April 5, 2019 The almost certain impending legal battle over the president’s tax returns will likely stretch out for months, meaning there is a high chance that even if Democrats do get their hands on them , it won’t be until after the 2020 presidential election. Trump has been able to stall on releasing his returns for this long — odds are, even with House Democrats turning up the pressure, this won’t be his last stand."
A pro-gun activist lobbied for “constitutional carry” by showing up at Texas lawmakers’ homes. Now the bill is DOA.,www.vox.com,Amanda Sakuma,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/6/18298181/texas-constitutional-carry-concealed-gun-rights,"Flipboard Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images A Texas bill allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit is now indefinitely stalled after a pro-gun activist advocated for the legislation by stalking state lawmakers — even appearing at their homes. On Friday, Texas House Speaker Dennis Bonnen announced plans to abandon the “constitutional carry” bill after the activist, Chris McNutt, showed up at his doorstep and at the homes of two other lawmakers. McNutt, executive director of the nonprofit Texas Gun Rights, was reportedly outraged the bill failed to advance quickly through the legislature. He posted a series of rants to his group’s Facebook page complaining about the legislative inaction. He followed these posts with videos of himself visiting the neighborhoods of two Republican state lawmakers, Reps. Dustin Burrows of Lubbock and Four Price of Amarillo. McNutt’s social media activity prompted Texas state troopers to put Bonnen’s home under surveillance, the Houston Chronicle reports . That’s how authorities were able to intercept the activist when he attempted to visit the speaker’s home last week while Bonnen was nearly 200 miles away at the state capitol in Austin. Bonnen’s wife and teenage son were reportedly home at the time. Friday, Bonnen called McNutt’s actions “gutless intimidation tactics.” “One fringe organization’s leader disturbingly traveled over 700 miles in 24 hours just to visit the homes of lawmakers — knowing full well that members were hundreds of miles away in our Capitol while wives and children were alone,” Bonnen said in a statement. McNutt’s actions seem to have rattled several state lawmakers who now say they no longer plan to move forward with the controversial gun bill. House Bill 357 would allow gun owners to carry a pistol, either openly or concealed, without a permit. In February, the chairman of the chair of Texas’ House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Poncho Nevárez , said he planned to hold a hearing on the bill before the end of the legislative session. In light of recent events, however, Nevárez says he has reconsidered. McNutt claims Bonnen is guilty of “ fabricating a media hit ” against him and other grassroots advocates across Texas. “If politicians like Speaker Dennis Bonnen think they can show up at the doorsteps of Second Amendment supporters and make promises to earn votes in the election season, they shouldn’t be surprised when we show up in their neighborhoods to insist they simply keep their promises in the legislative session,” he said, according to the Dallas Morning News . Grassroots activists are largely driving the constitutional carry movement There’s been a wave of so-called constitutional carry or “permit-less carry” laws sweeping across the US in recent years. The laws allow gun owners to carry firearms, concealed or not, anywhere in public without obtaining a permit or special training beforehand. As many as 20 states have considered measures that roll back restrictions on gun ownership. South Dakota became the latest state to enact such a law earlier this year, and now allows its citizens to carry weapons without a permit. Lawmakers in both Kentucky and Oklahoma advanced measures that would remove requirements for permits and training in February. According to The Trace, a nonprofit news site that exclusively covers guns and gun violence, local grassroots activists in each state are largely driving the movement to expand concealed carry rights. In the view of many pro-gun rights activists, any limitation on a gun owner’s right to carry firearms, either in public spaces or private, is a clear violation of the Second Amendment. Lobbying successes for constitutional carry legislation have empowered pro-gun rights to such an extent that their lobbying efforts have even begun to eclipse those of the National Rifle Association. The Trace’s Adam Weinstein explains: While the nation’s largest gun lobby champions the latest bills in its press releases, local lobbyists who take the NRA’s absolutist rhetoric at face value find themselves chafing at its corporate model of working hand-in-glove with establishment politicians. The resulting friction has fed into the upheaval taking place within gun politics (and American conservatism as a whole) since the rise of the Tea Party, which has left the NRA frequently following, rather than steering, the emboldened extremes of its coalition. Activists in several states told The Trace that the NRA — which did not respond to requests for comment for this story — has not helped their cause. In one state, they point to direct evidence that the NRA has undercut their proposals. The efforts of pro-gun activists are starting to bear fruit. Prior to 2010, only two states allowed concealed guns in public spaces without permits or specified training. Now, more than a dozen have constitutional carry laws on the books. But as state lawmakers made clear this week, Texas likely won’t join their number any time soon."
Mindfulness meditation in America has a capitalism problem,www.vox.com,Sean Illing,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/3/29/18264703/mindfulness-meditation-buddhism-david-forbes,"Flipboard Capitalism has a way of co-opting a lot of our culture’s best ideas. Great concepts in fashion, music, and wellness are constantly rebranded and used to peddle consumer products. Whether it’s punk music or yoga, industry will find a way to profit from it. Is mindfulness meditation the latest victim? This is the argument David Forbes, a professor of contemplative education at Brooklyn College, makes in his new book Mindfulness and Its Discontents . The number of Americans who’ve tried meditation has tripled since 2012. And many are doing a specific practice with Buddhist roots called mindfulness, which involves directing your attention to your experience in the present moment with kindness and without judgment. The practice is increasingly being offered in schools , health care facilities, and prisons to improve well-being. So how is this a bad thing? A lightly edited transcript of my conversation with Forbes follows. Sean Illing What does the mindfulness movement in America look like from your point of view, and how is it changing? David Forbes It’s a lot of different things. The mindfulness you see in Buddhist communities is not the same mindfulness being promoted in corporations and schools across the country. There are lots of people who join a mindfulness group or take an MBSR (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction) course, and being part of a small community like that helps a lot. And plenty of people just practice mindfulness by themselves, in isolation, at home or wherever. At the same time, mindfulness is also becoming an industry, and lots of companies are cashing in on it. I live in New York, and there are money-making studios popping up all over the place. And mindfulness is being marketed [by them] as very much an individualistic practice, which is not healthy and even further contributes to stress and ill-health. Sean Illing What sort of problems is this creating within the movement? David Forbes Well, it raises a question about the intentions of those who practice mindfulness — both those who identify as Buddhists of any kind, and those who are part of a general mindfulness movement in the US and internationally. Buddhists seek to let go of attachment to the myth of the private, solid, unchanging self, and to promote universal compassion and end universal suffering. But capitalist culture enforces the myth of the privatized, self-centered self. So unless mindfulness is employed in the service of making the world a better place — then practicing can and does end up serving to maintain the very self-centered, greedy, individualistic institutions and relationships that contribute to the lack of connected presence, kindness, and compassion that contribute to our unhappiness. They help people adjust to the status quo rather than helping to transform it. Sean Illing Does mindfulness, in your view, have a moral foundation? David Forbes Buddhism has ethical values and practices such as non-violence. Its deeper moral stance is that we are interconnected with all beings, to all our social relationships and institutions, and with the earth itself. People will argue that you become kinder and more compassionate just by practicing mindfulness. But I believe people need a moral framework in addition to mindfulness, some social vision to guide them. I think [in many US contexts it has] been severed from this moral tradition. Without that, meditation can become just another tool of self-absorption. Sean Illing Some people will read this and wonder why is teaching mindfulness as a coping mechanism so problematic if it does, in fact, help people? David Forbes Well, I don’t think it’s an either-or situation. I think it’s a good thing that people are getting tools to help them cope with difficult circumstances. I don’t want to dismiss that. My problem is that it ultimately doesn’t go far enough because it reinforces the sources of our unhappiness. As long as mindfulness is focused on the individual and not on our social situation, it will not help us change the conditions that are making us unhappy, namely a hyper-competitive, ultra-individualistic culture that separates and alienates us. Sean Illing Are you troubled that millions of Americans are discovering mindfulness through apps like Headspace and Calm, which recently became the first mindfulness startup to reach $1 billion valuation unicorn status ? David Forbes It depends on what you value. Again, I think it’s great that people are finding ways to de-stress and focus better. But as more and more people make money off of mindfulness, I think it corrupts the spirit of the tradition and practice. I think it becomes more and more a product like any other in our society, and I think it becomes more an individualistic pursuit. But what can I say? Capitalism always finds a way to make money off of something, and mindfulness is no different. Sean Illing What are examples of mindfulness being co-opted in the way you’re describing? David Forbes A lot of corporations are adopting mindfulness as part of their corporate culture. Mindfulness without any moral roots can be used as a hack for all kinds of unsavory ends. Google , Goldman Sachs , and Aetna among others have trained many employees in mindfulness for stress reduction. These corporations have been involved in various scandals and unethical practices that are at odds with the public good. There’s no evidence that mindfulness has made them kinder, gentler, or more socially responsible. Mindfulness is used instead to enhance employee productivity and performance by getting them to focus better [or] cut down on employer healthcare costs from stressed-out workers. All of this is aimed at improving the bottom line. Sean Illing Any other examples? David Forbes There are also well-intentioned educators in schools across the country that are teaching mindfulness but lack any analysis of neoliberal reform in our education system. So they’re helping kids feel less anxiety about high-stakes tests without questioning the meaning and quality of those tests in the first place, without challenging the individualistic, competitive ethos underneath it all. Mindfulness is also being used in inner-city schools as an anger-reduction technique, which in its own way is terrific. But at the same time, maybe we should be asking if that anger is legitimate? Maybe we should be asking why kids are angry and alienated? If we’re focused on reducing the reaction to these injustices and not focused on fixing the problems at the source of it all, how much good are we really doing? Again, I want to be clear: I’m not opposed to teaching mindfulness to students or anyone else. But I just think we cannot ignore the moral and social dimensions of life, and I worry this is what’s happening. Sean Illing What does your vision of “social mindfulness” look like? Do you think we should be meditating with other people? Do you think we need to supplement mindfulness training with a concrete political agenda? David Forbes In mindfulness, you focus on your breathing and you’re noticing your thoughts as they come and go. What I’m suggesting is that we expand on this and begin to identify where those thoughts are coming from. How are we conditioned by certain troublesome patterns rooted in dominant society? What are the forces or structures perpetuating those patterns? In this way, we’re using our attention to really pay attention to the sources of our unhappiness and then the next step to work to overturn those sources."
Stream This: The Tick is the perfect superhero show for our times,www.vox.com,Todd VanDerWerff,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/4/6/18297488/the-tick-season-2-amazon-review,"Arthur (Griffin Newman, center) and The Tick (Peter Serafinowicz, right) meet a new character played by John Hodgman. Myles Aronowitz/Amazon Video When Chicago debuted on Broadway in 1975 , it was generally well-received, despite some reviewers finding it a bit too over-the-top in its satire of crime, celebrity, and show business. It ran for two years, always in the shadow of the smash hit A Chorus Line (which had opened around the same time). And then it closed. But in 1996, Chicago came back to Broadway , in a new production that only further played up the idea of criminal defendants becoming glitzy superstars. Suddenly, the show felt as if it had found its era. The same story thatfelt wild and over-the-top in 1975 felt dead-on in the wake of the O.J. Simpson trial and many other big trials of the era. That revival is still running to this day. This is all to say that in 2019, the superhero spoof The Tick , which just debuted its 10-episode second season on Amazon Video, has found its era. The character was invented by comics creator Ben Edlund , who debuted the big blue guy in 1986 as the mascot for a comics shop. From there, The Tick has been a comics character (with his first issue published in 1988), an animated TV show (which debuted in 1994), and a live-action TV show (2001). And all along, the character has been the epitome of a “cult favorite.” Related Amazon’s The Tick throws the aggressively cheerful hero into a realistically bleak world In all iterations, The Tick has played around with the wildest elements of comic book lore, simultaneously parodying, dissecting, and celebrating superhero worlds. Fond of non sequiturs and hyper-earnestness, the Tick was the kind of superhero who most made sense in a world that was utterly nonsensical, which is what superhero worlds inevitably become. But the earlier TV iterations of The Tick were broadcast in worlds where superheroes weren’t at the center of pop culture in the way they are now. And the smartest thing that Amazon's spin on the character (whose first season was released in two parts across 2017 and 2018) has done is keep the story simple, while taking the idea that The Tick exists in a superhero world seriously — so seriously that its heroes often have to complete paperwork (I assure you this is hilarious). The gags don’t stop there. This universe’s spin on Superman, Superian ( Brendan Hines ) grows frustrated as he watches cable news talking heads complain about his actions. The Tick himself (played by Peter Serafinowicz ) searches vainly for an origin story, since his memory loss prevents him from having one. There’s a supervillain named Lobstercules and a heroic boat named Dangerboat, for God’s sake. I’m speaking as if The Tick made a conscious choice to abandon the things that made it so cult-y in the past, in favor of some more accessible type of storytelling. And on some level it did, since you can easily leap into this series without having seen any previous version of The Tick . But I’m not sure the show really made such a choice. Instead, our reality has simply become more accessible to the sorts of storytelling we see on The Tick . Superheroes are so omnipresent in pop culture that jokes about them and the ridiculous powers they could have are easier to understand, even if you don’t know exactly that this new character is a sly riff on the obscure DC Comics hero Plastic Man . However, Amazon’s The Tick is also the most grounded take on this story yet. It’s centered less on the big blue guy than it is on his sidekick Arthur (played by Griffin Newman , who, full disclosure: I’ve been on his podcast , and he’s been on mine , which is basically friendship) and on Arthur’s sister, Dot ( Valorie Curry ). Both characters are trying to find a way to put the traumatic death of their father — which occurred when they were children — behind them. Arthur finds a moth-like suit that gives him his own powers; in season two, Dot tries to invent her own meaning for herself, in a sly wink to how rarely these sorts of stories give women powers or storylines of their own. Related What it’s like to act in a tight-fitting superhero suit, according to a star of The Tick The Tick has always considered what it means to live in a world of superheroes and villains, to know that your life could be changed or ruined by one at any moment. What makes it so relevant in 2019 is that we all kind of live in that world, too, if only by proxy. But where so many other superhero stories nowadays focus on the heroes themselves, The Tick stays just as focused on its heroes’ ground-bound pals, whose powers aren’t always as obvious. The Tick is streaming on Amazon Video . In this Storystream"

Copies of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows on a sales display in Tokyo in 2007. Junko Kimura/Getty Images Welcome to Vox’s weekly book link roundup, a curated selection of the internet’s best writing on books and related subjects. Here’s the best the web has to offer for the week of March 31, 2019. Salvador Dalí used to illustrate books in his spare time, and the images — which cover a large swath of the Western canon — are fascinating. Artsy has an overview : Had Dalí’s images for Macbeth been his sole artistic output, he’d still be remembered as a master draftsman. To bring Act II, Scene II to life, he drew Lady Macbeth in profile and her husband head-on, two halves of one gruesome face. His illustrations for Don Quixote are rougher and less illusionistic—studying them, you’re always conscious of their being works on paper , perfect for a novel about a man driven bonkers by his own library. His take on Alice in Wonderland , completed at the height of the counterculture movement, may be his most beloved contribution to the art of illustration; for Lewis Carroll, Dalí eschewed the crispness and lucidity of his earlier work in favor of a dreamier watercolor aesthetic. At Electric Lit, Manuel Betancourt considers the myth of the maverick publisher : Obscene presents all these various tidbits as badges of honor. Look at this guy! the documentary suggests, Wasn’t he a total badass? He drank at work! His publishing instinct was to go after stuff that turned him on! He even shut down an attempt to form a union at Grove Press! Who wouldn’t be impressed and inspired by such a “maverick”? And that’s the most depressing part of Obscene : a lot of people still would. After all, Rosset is a walking archetype of those “bad boys” popular culture in general, and the publishing industry in particular, insists are to be fawned over and idolized. For the Guardian, Lois Beckett reports on romance’s fight for both legitimacy and diversity : Coverage of the romance industry often dwells on the contrast between the nubile young heroines of the novels and the women who actually write the books: ordinary women with ordinary bodies, dressed for their own comfort. Reporting on the first annual conference of the Romance Writers of America (RWA) – the major trade association for romance authors – in 1981, the Los Angeles Times wrote that the 500 authors who attended were “not the stuff of which romance heroines are made – at mostly 40 and 50, they were less coquette and more mother-of-the-bride”. That observation – combining creeping horror at the idea that middle-aged women might be interested in sex, with indifference to the fact that male authors are rarely judged for failing to resemble James Bond – is typical. A priest in northern Poland led hisfollowers in burning items that they felt might be leading them toward sorcery, including some Harry Potter books. He says he’s sorry if anyone took it the wrong way . At the New Yorker, comma queen Mary Norris attends the annual American Copy Editors Society conference and considers the difficulty of the New Yorker’s style guide in the age of descriptivism: Still, the magazine’s copy editors dutifully hyphenate “teen-ager” even as we half-heartedly enforce the ban on “balding”—the editor William Shawn preferred “partly or partially bald”—without knowing exactly what is wrong with it. “To bald” may not be a common intransitive verb, but that has not prevented “balding” from entering the language as a participle. Personally, I think the practice might have its origins in sensitivity on the part of Mr. Shawn, who was partially bald. People used to carry tiny and elaborately decorated almanacs with them wherever they went. Atlas Obscura has a sampling : The fact that almanacs were designed to be discarded makes it difficult to estimate how many miniature versions were produced, but “apparently, more of these [almanacs] were printed and attractively bound than any other kind of miniature book,” writes Jan Storm van Leeuwen , an instructor at the University of Virginia’s Rare Book School and co-curator of the Grolier Club exhibition, in the accompanying catalog. The pages of almanacs of all sizes brimmed with weather forecasts, timetables for coach routes, tide charts, and “tables for converting money, weights, and distances,” Storm van Leeuwen writes. Buyers of fancy miniature versions could select which sections they wanted to have bound, which meant that many almanacs printed in the same place in the same year could contained different information. In some cases the bindings were designed so that the almanac pages could be replaced each year, and the precious exteriors reused. At the New York Review of Books, Sue Halpern writes in praise of public libraries : It occurred to me one Saturday, as I watched quilters sitting at our one table trade patterns and children clear the shelves of The Magic School Bus series, racing to check them out, that the man who had said that libraries were communist had been right. A public library is predicated on an ethos of sharing and egalitarianism. It is nonjudgmental. It stands in stark opposition to the materialism and individualism that otherwise define our culture. It is defiantly, proudly, communal. Even our little book-lined room, with its mismatched furniture and worn carpet, was, as the sociologist Eric Klinenberg reminds us libraries were once called, a palace for the people. At LitHub, check out these early discarded drafts of book covers . Lincoln in the Bardo is the marquee title here, but I’m personally extremely into the early versions of Solar Bones .

They set the table for the elitist and infallible attitude MSM/journalism has today. There is no doubt information back then was ""edited"" to push what CBS, NBC, ABC etc wanted you to know. I don't disagree with you at all. I merely point out that today's journalists want the unquestioned recognition and fame the Cronkite types had back then. Many modern journalists act as if power automatically comes with the title, journalist. Politicians learned to use television as a messaging service in the 60's starting the downward slide of news print and the elevation of TV personalities (telling not reporting) controlling the information flow. It was the beginning of a corrupt relationship between the ""new"" media called TV and the ""modern"" politician."

and subjective opinion. If people read or watch an opinion piece,
they know they are seeing a point of view.
The corporate mass media, however, used to claim objectivity, except in its defined ""editorials.""
There is a place for both, but today's mass media mislabels
its leftist activism as objective reporting. They slant what
they advertise as objective both in how the information is presented, and in what they do or do not choose to allow their
audience to discover.
And they hope no one notices.
People do notice, and the mass media will never regain the
credibility it has lost. People hate to be lied to, either through commission or omission.
People demand all the facts and differing points of view, to
then be able to think and decide for themselves. That is why
they flock to new media sites like Breitbart."

After all, it was clear when then-private attorney William Barr was asked to meet w/DOJ officials over lunch three weeks after submitting an unsolicited analysis of the Mueller investigation that something unusual was happening. Perhaps the saga of AG William Barr has yet to be understood in the context of Donald Trump's presidency.
https://www.yahoo.com/news/...
From the above link:
Justice department officials were told William Barr had been invited to meet them last summer on the same day he submitted an “unsolicited” memo that heavily criticized special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into obstruction of justice by Donald Trump.
Barr, who was a private attorney at the time, met the officials for lunch three weeks later and was then nominated to serve as Trump’s attorney general about six months later.
The revelation about the meeting, which was arranged by Steve Engel, the head of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice, and which has not previously been publicly disclosed, raises new questions about whether the White House’s decision to hire Barr was influenced by private discussions he had about his legal views on Mueller’s investigation."

When they did so, and with the widespread comparisons available on the internet, people could see that the talking points were all the same -- they all used the same words to condemn him -- which suggested that all of their talking points came from the same sources.
Further, when Trump got up there on the stage, and called them 'fake news', it got some people thinking. If just 10% of a crowd follows up a statement with some personal research, and finds out that whatever Trump said is TRUE... then they tell a friend, who tells a friend, and within 1 month, 30% of the country has a common understanding that mainstream media is 'fake news'. As more and more proof becomes available, it reinforces that common theme.

The Obama presidency allowed the Left to take over what used to be the 'Liberal' party -- now it is outwardly socialist, and some even declare themselves outright communists.
It is NOT the Democrat Party that it used to be. If Trump runs in 2020 (and he might not), then Trump wins. There is no real Democrat challenge to Trump; it is all up-and-comers who are trying to gain publicity for themselves in the 2020 elections.
