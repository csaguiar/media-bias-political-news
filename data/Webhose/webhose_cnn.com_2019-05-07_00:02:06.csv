Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin are dealing with college cheating scandal in different ways,us.cnn.com,Faith Karimi,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/felicity-huffman-lori-loughlin-different-reactions/index.html,"(CNN) Of the 50 people caught up in the largest college admissions cheating scheme ever prosecuted in the United States, actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin have become the faces of the scandal, with many wondering whether they will end up behind bars.
Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman make court appearances in college admissions scandal Huffman and Loughlin are among 33 parents accused of using their wealth to cheat on standardized tests for their children, and bribe college administrators and coaches who had major clout when it came to admissions. The investigation took a crucial turn last week when Huffman and a dozen other parents and one coach agreed to plead guilty to mail fraud and other forms of bribery, highlighting the separate actions both women have taken since the scandal broke. Here are the different ways the actresses have dealt with the fallout: Felicity Huffman Read More What is she accused of? Huffman has agreed to plead guilty to paying $15,000 to a fake charity associated with Rick Singer to facilitate cheating for her daughter on the SATs. Singer ran a college prep business, and helped wealthy parents cheat on standardized tests for their children. He also bribed college coaches to designate children falsely as recruited athletes, smoothing their path to admission, a criminal complaint says. Felicity Huffman's Netflix film won't release in April as scheduled Huffman and Singer exchanged emails about how to get extra time on her daughter's SAT, the complaint says. They arranged for Huffman's daughter to take the SAT at a location controlled by an administrator bribed by Singer, the complaint says. The daughter got a score of 1420 out of a maximum 1600 on the SAT, about 400 points over her Preliminary SAT exam a year earlier. Does she plan to plead guilty? Yes. As a result, federal prosecutors said they will recommend incarceration at the ""low end"" of the sentencing range, a $20,000 fine and 12 months of supervised release, according to a plea agreement. Prosecutors recommended a range of sentences for those pleading guilty, from 12 to 18 months. A federal judge will have the final say on the outcome for Huffman and the other defendants. In addition to lower sentencing, prosecutors will not bring further charges, the plea agreement says. What has she said about the alleged scandal? She issued an apology and took responsibility for her actions, saying her daughter was not aware of the payment. She said she had betrayed her daughter and wouldn't make any excuses for breaking the law. ""I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done ... and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions,"" she said in a statement. ""I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly."" Felicity Huffman will plead guilty to paying $15,000 to facilitate cheating for her daughter on the SAT. How much prison time is she facing? It's unclear whether a guilty plea will mean no time in prison. Prosecutors plan to seek a sentence of four to 10 months' jail time, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation. Huffman is due back in court on May 21 for a sentencing hearing. The actress and the other defendants are facing anywhere between six to 21 months in prison if convicted or if they plead guilty, but the exact sentence will depend on several factors, a law enforcement source told CNN. Has the fallout affected her acting career? A Netflix comedy film starring Huffman won't be hitting the streaming platform on April 26, its previously scheduled release date. ""Otherhood"" is about three mothers who move from the suburbs to New York so they can reconnect with their children. While it is not uncommon for film release dates to shift, news of the film's pushback came a day after the ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""American Crime"" actress entered her plea in the college admissions scam. Lori Loughlin What is she accused of? Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of paying $500,000 to a fake charity to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as crew recruits. Their daughters did not participate in the sport. Does she plan to plead guilty? Loughlin and her husband both pleaded not guilty to two conspiracy charges in the college admissions scandal, according to federal court filings. Loughlin and 15 other parents face a charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering in addition to last month's charge of conspiracy to commit fraud. They were charged last Tuesday in a superseding indictment with conspiring to launder bribes and other payments through Singer's charity, prosecutors said. The added charges came a day after Huffman and others agreed to plead guilty in the case. Loughlin's attorneys did not engage in substantial plea discussions, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation. It's not too late, however, for those negotiations to still take place, the source said. CNN has reached out to Loughlin's counsel for comment. Lori Loughlin and her husband are accused of paying $500,000 to get their daughters into USC. What has she said about the alleged scandal? Not much. Late last month, the actress was caught on video by paparazzi in Los Angeles and said she was sorry, but she couldn't talk about her legal issues. ""You can follow me around all day if you want, but I just can't comment right now,"" Loughlin said. ""But thank you for your time."" How much prison time is she facing? The charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud are punishable by a maximum 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater. The charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering is punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, according to federal officials. Has the fallout affected her acting career? The ""Full House"" actress was dropped by the Hallmark Channel and other brands in the wake of last month's charges. Sephora also ended a makeup partnership with her daughter, the social media influencer Olivia Jade, who was a student at USC."

View this post on Instagram We are excited to announce that The Duke of Sussex and Oprah Winfrey are partners, co-creators and executive producers on their forthcoming mental health series launching on Apple in 2020. The pair have been developing the series for several months and are looking forward to sharing such an important project on this global platform. The dynamic multi-part documentary series will focus on both mental illness and mental wellness, inspiring viewers to have an honest conversation about the challenges each of us faces, and how to equip ourselves with the tools to not simply survive, but to thrive. This commitment builds on The Duke of Sussex's long-standing work on issues and initiatives regarding mental health, where he has candidly shared personal experience and advocated for those who silently suffer, empowering them to get the help and support they deserve. His Royal Highness has spent many years working with communities throughout the UK and young people across the Commonwealth to break the stigma surrounding mental illness and broaden the conversation of mental wellness to accelerate change for a more compassionate, connected and positive society.

Winfrey, who attended Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle -- now the Duchess of Sussex -- in May, told ""CBS This Morning"" Wednesday that the collaboration began when she was having a conversation with the prince and asked him what the most important issues facing the world were.

Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge competed in a race to promote the ""Heads Together"" campaign in 2017. ""I feel that if people really knew her they would know that she is not only everything that we perceive of her as being graceful and dynamic in holding that position, but she just has a wonderful, warm, giving, loving heart,"" Winfrey said.

(CNN) Of all of the crazy sounding things in the pantheon of modern physics, it's hard to beat a black hole . Generally speaking, black holes are the burned-out hulks of long dead stars, with a strong enough gravitational field that not even light can escape them.
The gravity near a black hole is so strong that it warps the very fabric of space and time. Black holes sound more like science fiction than fact, but there has been considerable indirect evidence that they exist. They are accepted by the scientific community in spite of an embarrassing admission: nobody has ever directly seen one. Well, until now. Don Lincoln Scientists have announced the first direct observation of a black hole at the center of a galaxy named M87. M87 is a supergiant elliptical galaxy in the constellation Virgo. It is one of the largest galaxies in the nearby universe. (Where ""nearby"" is the staggering distance of 53 million light years . Astronomers really do think big.) Now a little bit of care is necessary to understand exactly what was done. Black holes are, well, black. By definition, they do not emit any light. So, the black hole was not observed directly. However, black holes are also surrounded by ordinary matter that is caught in the hole's gravitational grip. This matter, which is typically just gas of the same type that makes up our sun, orbits the black hole at very high speeds. All of that fast-moving gas gets heated up to the point where it glows and emits all sorts of forms of electromagnetic radiation, from heat to light to radio waves. Intervening gas blocks the visible heat and light, so astronomers look for the radio waves. Read More You'd think that astronomers would announce that they detected this halo of radio waves surrounding the hole, and that is part of the story. However, it's more complicated than that. Because of the very strong gravity near the black hole, some of the light and radio waves are captured by it and don't escape. The result is that a black hole looks like a ring of light, with a shadow in the middle. Essentially, from a distance, the picture astronomers released of the M87 black hole looks like a coffee ring left on a piece of paper, albeit a colored one. Nobel Prize-winning detectors revealed a cosmic cataclysm Since the astronomers used radio waves to see the black hole, the colors aren't what you would see with your eye. But they do have meaning. What we are seeing is the gas surrounding the black hole. One side is bright and one is dim because the black hole is spinning. The yellow shows the side of the black hole spinning toward us and the reddish side is spinning away. Aside from the difficulties associated with seeing something that is perfectly black, another difficulty is their size. Ordinary black holes, which have a mass the few times as big as our Sun, are only about as big as the city of Chicago. Combined with their great distances, they are simply too small to see with modern technology. Seeing the closest known black hole is as difficult as a telescope in New York City seeing a single molecule in Los Angeles. This is well beyond current technical capabilities. Luckily, the center of nearly all galaxies contain an enormous black hole. For example, the one in the center of our Milky Way galaxy has the mass of about 4 million times that of our sun with a radius about 30 times that of the sun. However, the black hole at the center of M87 is truly gigantic. Its mass is about 7 billion times the mass of our sun. And its dimensions are huge as black holes go. It is a sphere with a radius about 130 times that of the Earth's orbit or about three times bigger than the average orbit of Pluto. Einstein's theory was put to the test. Guess what happened That sounds large, but the distance to M87 is so huge that the black hole at the center of that galaxy subtends a tiny angle. It is unbelievably small -- it's equivalent to the width of a line drawn by a sharpened pencil seen from the distance separating New York and Los Angeles, a task that is possible if scientists use an incredibly clever technique that uses the entire Earth as a telescope. And, luckily, the shadow cast by the black hole is about 2.5 times wider than the hole itself. In 2006, an international consortium of astronomers formed a group called the Event Horizon Telescope . The name is misleading, as their equipment isn't a telescope in the way we ordinarily think of it. Instead, the equipment they use is called a radio telescope , which is just an ultra-sensitive radio antenna. And another level of confusion is that the group didn't employ a single antenna. Instead what they did was to tie together a web of radio telescopes spread across the entire planet. The reason they did that is simple. How small an object a telescope can see depends crucially on the size of the telescope. The bigger the telescope, the smaller objects it can resolve. A world-class radio telescope is only a few hundred feet across. However, by tying together a worldwide network of radio receivers, astronomers can effectively make a telescope the size of the Earth -- essentially a radio telescope about 8,000 miles wide. And by using ultra-precise atomic clocks to synchronize the observations made from around the world, astronomers were able to resolve the shadow of the black hole at the center of the M87galaxy.

Science is all about pushing the limits -- studying what was once impossible to do. And, being perfectly black, tiny and very distant, black holes certainly qualify. Yet black holes are a key laboratory for testing Einstein's theory of relativity, which is our best theory of gravity. Because of this, scientists have indirectly studied them for decades, from observing their effect on nearby stars, to seeing how they heat up giant clouds of gas, to detecting how their motion sends ripples through space and time. But seeing one directly is a new thing and a huge advance in our ability to understand the behavior of matter under the strongest gravitational forces imaginable.

Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley is writing a book about her time in Trump administration - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Zachary Cohen,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/nikki-haley-book/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Nikki Haley, the former US Ambassador to the United Nations and Governor of South Carolina, is writing a book ""about her life and leadership"" that will come out this fall, her publisher announced Wednesday.
The book does not yet have a title, but in it, Haley ""will talk candidly about her tenure as UN Ambassador and the consequential actions, decisions, confrontations, and behind-the-scenes negotiations that shaped national and world events,"" according to a statement from St. Martin's Press. It will also describe personal experiences that ""shaped Haley's actions as governor and ambassador, as well as the challenges she and all women face when they assume roles traditionally occupied by men,"" the press release said. ""I was blessed to serve during some momentous times as Governor of South Carolina and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. There were tragedies and triumphs, but through it all my love for America has only grown. My hope with this book is to give people a unique window into recent history and inspire us toward a better future,"" Haley said in a statement. Trump's UN Ambassador Nikki Haley resigns President Donald Trump caught many senior administration officials off guard when he announced Haley's resignation in October, sources told CNN. Read More But despite questions about the timing of her departure, it seems Haley left her post on good terms with the President. After announcing her resignation, Trump praised Haley as a ""fantastic person"" who has ""done an incredible job"" and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line. ""She's done a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together. We've solved a lot of problems and we're in the process of solving a lot of problems,"" Trump said. Haley called serving as UN ambassador ""an honor of a lifetime,"" but added that it was time for her to depart the administration. ""There's no personal reason,"" she said, explaining her rationale for departing. ""It's very important for government officials to understand when it's time to step aside."" But a source familiar with the issue previously told CNN that financial considerations did come into play for Haley, something she alluded to in her resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. With one child in college and another heading there soon, Haley felt like she needs to make some money, the source said."
Xerox is one of this year's top stocks - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Paul R. La Monica,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/investing/xerox-stock/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Investors are infatuated with hot, young, rapidly growing tech companies. So you might be surprised to learn that the second-best performer in the S&P 500 has been around for more than a century.
Xerox ( XRX ) , founded in 1906, is having quite a year: Its stock is up nearly 70% in 2019. Curiously enough, the best stock in the index is an even older company, cosmetics giant Coty ( COTY ) ‚Äî founded in 1904. What's behind Xerox's success? Does anyone really use photocopiers anymore? Xerox is soaring because it is making a bold bet to morph from a stodgy documents company into a more dynamic tech firm. Activist investor Carl Icahn has pushed Xerox to make changes and Icahn's hand-picked CEO John Visentin has made big moves, including a plan to turn Xerox into a holding company with separate operating units like Google parent company Alphabet ( GOOGL ) . Read More The first Xerox photocopiers came to market in the 1950s. Shareholders will vote on the proposal at the company's shareholder meeting on May 21. Xerox has said that converting to a holding company will make it easier to buy and incubate other businesses and to keep them at an arm's length from Xerox's core operations. Xerox should also be able to reduce its tax bill and protect some of its key patents more effectively as a holding company. The company clearly is banking on new growth opportunities to rejuvenate the overall business. Visentin said at Xerox's annual investor day event in February that it plans to focus more on software and services. Xerox's sales may not grow for another two years But the transformation is going to take some time ‚Äî and Xerox, despite the stock surge, is still a company that nobody will confuse with Google, Amazon ( AMZN ) , Netflix ( NFLX ) or other hot, momentum companies. Visentin has said that the goal is for Xerox to post flat to growing sales by 2021. Xerox's earnings per share are only expected to rise about 2% annually, on average, over the next five years. But that would be an improvement over the average decline in earnings of more than 5% a year over the past five years. Analysts are skeptical though. Of the five that still cover Xerox, three have ""hold"" ratings on the stock while the other two have it rated a ""buy."" The consensus price target on Xerox's stock is $35.50 -- just 7% higher than current levels. Xerox is making a bold bet to go it alone. The company had planned to merge with Japanese rival Fujifilm but the deal was abandoned last year after Icahn and another activist investor, Darwin Deason, sued to block it. New CEO has his work cut out for him As part of a settlement with Icahn and Deason, Jeff Jacobson stepped down as Xerox CEO and Visentin was installed in his place. Icahn had pressured former Xerox CEO Ursula Burns to spin off the company's business services division in 2017. That company, now known as Conduent ( CNDT ) , has fallen nearly 30% since the separation from Xerox. Icahn is Xerox's largest shareholder, with a more than 10% stake. Deason owns nearly 4% of Xerox, making him the company's fifth biggest investor. Institutional investing giants Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors are the second, third and fourth largest holders of Xerox. They own a combined stake of just under 20%. These investors have to be pleased with Xerox's latest stock gains. But it may be hard for Xerox to duplicate them until the company can prove that it can get sales growth back on track."
"Wind power doesn't cause cancer. It creates jobs, Jay Inslee says - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Matt Egan,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/business/jay-inslee-wind-power-trump/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Wind power is a booming part of the American economy, not a bogeyman to fear, Washington State Governor Jay Inslee told CNN Business on Wednesday.
The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate said President Donald Trump's claim that noise from windmills causes cancer is ""ridiculous"" and ""another symptom of his failure to provide leadership."" Inslee noted that Trump's own Labor Department lists wind turbine service technician as America's second-fastest growing job between 2016 and 2026 -- behind only solar installer. ""A person who calls himself Republican and should be pro-business is demeaning one of the fastest growing businesses in the United States,"" Inslee said from the sidelines of the Columbia Global Energy Summit in New York. Washington State Governor Jay Inslee is the only 2020 presidential candidate running on climate change and he's pushing his state to go adopt carbon-free electricity. Inslee, who will appear at a CNN town hall event on Wednesday, called the wind industry ""one of the most successful parts of the economy."" Read More US wind power supported a record 114,000 domestic jobs in 2018, according to the American Wind Energy Association. Trump raised eyebrows last week when at a fundraiser he said of windmills: ""They say the noise causes cancer."" FactCheck.org concluded that there is no evidence that wind turbines cause cancer and cited an American Cancer Society statement saying it's ""unaware of any credible evidence linking the noise from windmills to cancer."" Politifact agreed, rating Trump's statement ""Pants on Fire."" Coal vs. renewables Trump's criticism of wind energy puts an exclamation point on his embrace of fossil fuels, most notably the coal industry. The administration slashed environmental regulations and made it easier to open new coal mines in a bid to fulfill Trump's campaign promises. Yet Trump has so far been unable to revive the coal industry due to fierce competition from cleaner fuel sources, including natural gas, solar and yes, wind. Xcel Energy was a coal-first power company. Now it's going carbon-free US coal consumption dropped in 2018 to the lowest level since 1979, according to government statistics. Renewable energy costs have plunged in recent years to levels that make wind and solar power competitive with, or even cheaper than, fossil fuels. ""Coal is just not economical,"" said Inslee, the only 2020 candidate to run on climate change. The Democrat said Trump not only ""failed"" to save coal jobs ‚Äî because it's not economically feasible ‚Äî but he failed to create viable alternatives for coal workers. 'Economic wasteland' Under Inslee, Washington State has moved towards renewable energy and announced plans to close its final coal-fired power plant. He said the state set aside a $65 million fund to help reinvest in the community. Last month, the state senate passed a clean energy bill that seeks to eliminate fossil fuels from the electricity supply by 2045. A similar proposal is making its way through the assembly. GE bets on offshore wind as fossil fuels business stumbles ""My state, according to Donald Trump, should be an economic wasteland right now because we've embraced clean energy,"" Inslee said at the Columbia energy summit. But Inslee cited Washington State's robust GDP and wage growth as evidence that clean energy can be used as a way to boost the economy. ""This is a unique moment because it's of the utmost peril and greatest promise for a clean energy economy that can grow jobs billions,"" said Inslee, who added that he drives a Chevrolet Bolt manufactured at a GM plant in Michigan. Limits on the shale boom? While coal is collapsing, America's oil and natural gas industries have boomed over the last decade thanks to the shale revolution, which has unlocked vast resources trapped underground. US oil output spiked to an all-time high in 2018, making America the largest oil producer on the planet. Despite the energy boom, US oil prices hit a five-month high this week due in large part to supply cuts by OPEC and US sanctions on Venezuela and Iran . And gasoline prices have crept higher as well. Trump plans to sign an executive order aimed at making it easier to build pipelines , freeing up oil and natural gas that has been trapped by a lack of infrastructure. Inslee, on the other hand, wants to end fracked gas leasing on public lands. And he warned it's ""totally unsustainable"" to burn all of America's oil because of climate change. ""We have to be very scrupulous before we build additional infrastructure that would accelerate the use of fossil fuels,"" Inslee said."

The brand said Wednesday that its board has accepted the resignation of Steve Stagner, who started his latest stint as chief executive in March 2018. He spent decades at the company before then. The leadership shakeup follows a difficult time for the brand, which has been struggling to compete with online retailers like Casper and Amazon ( AMZN ) . The company also over-expanded by acquiring the Sleepy's retail chain in 2015 . In October, Mattress Firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to get out of about 700 unfavorable leases.

(CNN) On Tuesday night, America was introduced to an unfamiliar woman: Kirsten Gillibrand, actual human being.
Jill Filipovic Gillibrand has been in politics for more than a decade, and her identity is more often caricatured (she's Hillary Jr., she's Tracy Flick , she's the woman who brought down Al Franken) than captured. Her CNN town hall on Tuesday was a chance for her to present herself to the many who may have only heard about her in outline. What she filled in: that she's a person who, like all of us, evolves and shifts; that she can be deeply empathetic and flatly indignant; that she's fluent in policy and has a message of fighting greed and knitting the country back together. In a political environment increasingly defined by overconfidence, unflinching certitude and uncompromising fidelity to a specific worldview, Gillibrand expressed caution and even remorse when she was uncertain. She said some of her decisions as a Congresswoman from a red district in upstate New York (from 2007-2009) now bring her shame -- a striking departure from the usual non-apology political justifications.

Why Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand loves 'Wonder Woman' 01:06 Where she was undecided or unsure on an issue -- something that came up in questions about mandatory vaccines and lowering the voting age to 16 -- she simply said so, rather than offering a winding non-answer. And when she knew, she knew: Gillibrand's policy solutions were detailed and clearly at the heart of her case. When she was asked about the role of private insurers in her vision of Medicare for All, she emphasized her role in crafting the transition section of Bernie Sanders's bill, explaining how broad Medicare benefits will essentially undercut insurance companies and naturally drive them from the marketplace. Read More She compared the Green New Deal to going to the moon: an exciting and perhaps preposterously ambitious plan, but one that is doable with dedication and resources -- and could even include, she said, getting to net-zero carbon. This is the striking thing about Gillibrand: she comes across as a human being who learns, changes, and is sometimes still making up her mind. But she's also a very particular kind of human being: sharp and determined, the kind of bull-headed lawyer whose personal inclination appears to be making her case without messing around with niceties. For a female politician in an ""is she likable?"" obsessed media landscape, this can be a liability. JUST WATCHED Gillibrand explains why she flip-flopped on immigration Replay More Videos ...

At her town hall, she recited a similar ""thanks for your bravery"" line to multiple questioners. Throughout her campaign, she has put maternity at the forefront, emphasizing her desire to make the world better and safer for her sons. Personally, I like bull-headed, get-stuff-done-and-forget-your-feelings Gillibrand. But that's not exactly a winning persona for a woman in a sexist country, and so last night she led with Empathetic Kirsten. And good for her. Much of her work, especially on sexual assault, has clearly been driven by empathy, it just hasn't necessarily come across in the coverage. As a senator, she led the charge on combating sexual assault in the military and on college campuses, truly owning the issue and lending her platform to vulnerable men and women. But she found herself better known for being one of several senators who called on Al Franken to resign after he was accused of sexual misconduct, and inappropriate photos surfaced of him that appeared to show him pretending to grope a sleeping woman. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand: Americans deserve a brave president Despite the fact that her decision to hold Franken accountable was exactly in line with her policy positions, many Franken sympathizers accused her of trampling his due process to put herself in the spotlight. And despite the fact that several other members of the senate also called for his resignation, Gillibrand took the heat for being an early voice. On Tuesday night, given a chance to show a fuller version of herself to America, Gillibrand leaned into her own complications. And in doing so, she helped expand, just a little more, the idea of who a woman in politics can be."

(CNN) Of all of the crazy sounding things in the pantheon of modern physics, it's hard to beat a black hole . Generally speaking, black holes are the burned-out hulks of long dead stars, with a strong enough gravitational field that not even light can escape them.
The gravity near a black hole is so strong that it warps the very fabric of space and time. Black holes sound more like science fiction than fact, but there has been considerable indirect evidence that they exist. They are accepted by the scientific community in spite of an embarrassing admission: nobody has ever directly seen one. Well, until now. Don Lincoln Scientists have announced the first direct observation of a black hole at the center of a galaxy named M87. M87 is a supergiant elliptical galaxy in the constellation Virgo. It is one of the largest galaxies in the nearby universe. (Where ""nearby"" is the staggering distance of 53 million light years . Astronomers really do think big.) Now a little bit of care is necessary to understand exactly what was done. Black holes are, well, black. By definition, they do not emit any light. So, the black hole was not observed directly. However, black holes are also surrounded by ordinary matter that is caught in the hole's gravitational grip. This matter, which is typically just gas of the same type that makes up our sun, orbits the black hole at very high speeds. All of that fast-moving gas gets heated up to the point where it glows and emits all sorts of forms of electromagnetic radiation, from heat to light to radio waves. Intervening gas blocks the visible heat and light, so astronomers look for the radio waves. Read More You'd think that astronomers would announce that they detected this halo of radio waves surrounding the hole, and that is part of the story. However, it's more complicated than that. Because of the very strong gravity near the black hole, some of the light and radio waves are captured by it and don't escape. The result is that a black hole looks like a ring of light, with a shadow in the middle. Essentially, from a distance, the picture astronomers released of the M87 black hole looks like a coffee ring left on a piece of paper, albeit a colored one. Nobel Prize-winning detectors revealed a cosmic cataclysm Since the astronomers used radio waves to see the black hole, the colors aren't what you would see with your eye. But they do have meaning.

Are we at risk for an anthrax attack? 01:07 Anthrax outbreaks in wildlife and livestock often stir concern because the disease can spread to humans who might come in contact with an infected animal or eat meat or drink milk from an infected animal. In people, anthrax can be fatal if left untreated, and symptoms depend on the type of infection , such as small blisters for cutaneous anthrax; fever and chills for inhalation anthrax; or sore throat and nausea for gastrointestinal anthrax. ""Visitors to our park are at no risk if they observe park rules on avoiding contact with wild animals and we encourage them to continue with their tours,"" Susan Koech, principal secretary of Kenya's State Department of Wildlife , said in a news release Monday. The first case in the outbreak was confirmed to be anthrax last week; the death was reported March 29, according to the release. Read More The release also noted that the outbreak has been contained and officials are monitoring the situation. A team of veterinarians and park rangers is vaccinating animals to prevent further spread of the disease. The park lost buffalo and rhinos in 2015 in a similar anthrax outbreak. Sporadic cases of anthrax occur in animals worldwide, and there are occasional outbreaks in Africa and central Asia, according to the World Health Organization . Before the use of veterinary vaccines, anthrax was a major cause of deadly disease in livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, camels, horses and pigs throughout the world.

Hide Caption 8 of 8 ""Having contact with animals that have died from anthrax is actually the most common route for humans to become infected with anthrax,"" said Caitlin Cossaboom , an epidemic intelligence service officer in the Bacterial Special Pathogens Branch at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Anthrax is difficult to control, and outbreaks can be very difficult to predict,"" she said. ""A seasonal pattern of anthrax outbreaks has actually been described, particularly related to cycles of heavy rainfall that are followed by periods of drought when it's very dry and hot."" One massive anthrax outbreak among wildlife in Namibia killed more than 200 hippopotamuses and Cape buffalo between September and December 2017, putting people and livestock at huge risk of becoming infected. In that case, even though more than 1,000 people were identified as having contact with or consuming meat from animals involved in the outbreak, there were no reported human cases or deaths. The details about how humans were protected in the outbreak are shared in a paper led by Cossaboom and published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases on Wednesday. The key to keeping anthrax away from humans Dozens of hippopotamus and Cape buffalo carcasses were found along the Kavango River in Bwabwata National Park in Namibia in fall 2017, the first eerie evidence of that anthrax outbreak. Namibia's Ministry of Environment and Tourism, the Ministry of Health and Social Services and the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry worked together to contain the outbreak. The CDC also helped the Namibian ministries. The CDC worked closely with Namibia to collect specimens from affected wildlife carcasses for use with the newly developed Active Anthrax Detect Rapid Test. The paper described this use of the test in the field as ""successful."" How prepared is the US for an anthrax attack? Namibia's Ministry of Health and Social Services developed and administered a questionnaire to identify people living in communities adjacent to Bwabwata National Park who were exposed to the carcasses. Through the questionnaire, 1,050 people were identified as having contact with or consuming meat from the carcasses, according to the paper. They were immediately provided with post-exposure prophylactic antibiotics. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry secured about 10,000 doses of livestock anthrax vaccine and administered the vaccines to prevent spillover of anthrax from wildlife to susceptible domestic animals -- and subsequently to humans. ""Anthrax is only one of many, many diseases that are zoonotic, meaning they can be spread between animals and humans,"" Cossaboom said. ""Some examples of this include rabies, which can be spread through bites from infected animals to humans, and rabies, also like anthrax, can be controlled by controlling it in animals."" As prevention efforts were employed, the Ministry of Environment and Tourism started removing all of the dead animal carcasses from the Bwabwata National Park. ""The response in this outbreak -- including rapidly identifying people that had been exposed to the dead animals, providing them with antibiotics post-exposure and then starting the community engagement to raise awareness on what was going on -- was so critical,"" Cossaboom said. ""All of those actions together -- or this really rapid multisectorial response -- was the key to having a successful outcome,"" she said. ""Fortunately, because of all of those efforts and the rapid response, there were no human cases, despite over 1,000 people being exposed in this case."" 'Human risk always exists' The paper shows how a fast-acting multidisciplinary approach can prevent an outbreak in wildlife from becoming an outbreak in humans, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and member of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, who was not involved in the research. Get
""Human risk always exists with anthrax outbreaks in animals,"" Adalja wrote in an email. ""Anthrax is a zoonotic disease with human cases often tied to animal exposure. For example, multiple cases have occurred at African drumming events when individuals were exposed to animal drum skins that contained anthrax spores,"" he said. ""Because of the risk of spillover into humans, it is crucial to monitor animal anthrax outbreaks and delimit the exposure of humans while promptly administering post-exposure antibiotics to those exposed. It is also important to emphasize Anthrax is a major biowarfare threat and being prepared for outbreaks of animal origin directly enhances abilities to respond to a potential bioattack using anthrax."""

You've probably heard that the best way to fight climate change is to reduce your meat intake , but if you're not ready to go full vegan, a new study has found that you can slash polluting emissions by swapping your steak for animal organs. The meat industry accounts for 14.5% of total global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the transport sector's direct carbon output .

According to a study published in the Environmental Science and Technology journal, swapping beef ribs and pork chops for offal, internal organs and pig's trotters could lead to a drastic reduction in emissions. How far will you go to reduce your beef intake? The study on Germany's meat supply chain found that while reducing total meat consumption could see emissions fall by 32%, eating more offal instead of popular cuts could also lead to a significant reduction.

Stephen Miller: How he tightened his grip over Donald Trump's immigration and border policy - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/stephen-miller-tightens-grip-on-immigration-border-policy/index.html,"How Stephen Miller tightened his grip over Trump's immigration and border policy By Jeremy Diamond, Kaitlan Collins and Phil Mattingly, CNN Updated 11:45 AM EDT, Wed April 10, 2019
Washington (CNN) As President Donald Trump pushed his administration in recent weeks to take the drastic step of shutting down the US southern border, one key adviser fed Trump's impulse: Stephen Miller, the President's 33-year-old senior policy adviser and chief speechwriter who has long channeled Trump's hardline immigration views.
As most of the President's advisers sought to dissuade him from the idea, warning the economic consequences would be devastating, Miller encouraged the President to move forward with shutting down some ports of entry, two administration officials said.
While Trump was ultimately convinced to back down, Miller's stance solidified his position in Trump's mind as the chief facilitator of the President's hardline instincts and appears to have won him more power.
In the wake of that debate, Trump has moved to more formally empower Miller, telling aides in a recent Oval Office meeting that he was putting Miller in charge of all immigration and border issues, according to a person familiar with the meeting.
In the days since, there has been a cascade of personnel moves inside the Department of Homeland Security. Last week, Miller convinced the President to pull the nomination of Ron Vitiello as the next director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, bluntly telling Trump that Vitiello was ""soft"" on closing the southern border. The decision blindsided department officials and Republican lawmakers, who initially thought it was a clerical error.
Two days later, Trump announced the forced resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Two days after that, Nielsen's deputy, Claire Grady, resigned under pressure to make room for the President's preferred pick for acting secretary, Kevin McAleenan, the Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner. How border hardliners nudged out Nielsen
More turnover is anticipated -- giving Miller an expansive foothold to shape the administration's immigration policies and attempt end-runs around current laws.
More than anyone in the West Wing, Miller has developed a mind-meld with the President on immigration, arguably his most important issue heading into the 2020 election. Where some advisers have sought to temper Trump's instincts, Miller has unabashedly stoked them, earning him a reputation around Washington as a radical and influential voice inside the White House.
Administration officials caution that Miller is not some all-powerful and invisible hand driving every one of Trump's actions on immigration, as he is sometimes made out to be. The reality, they say, is more complex. While Miller goaded Trump on as he contemplated shutting down the US-Mexico border, the idea originated with Trump. And other advisers, including White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as well as senior adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, hold sway with Trump on immigration matters.
Asked Wednesday morning about Miller's role, the President praised Miller, but sought to dispel any questions about who is really driving his immigration policy.
""Frankly, there's only one person that's running it. You know who that is? It's me,"" he said, pointing to his head.
Minutes later, Miller responded to CNN's request for comment from the previous day: ""Only one person in this U.S. government runs immigration policy: President Donald Trump.""
Still, Miller now finds himself in the driver's seat and better positioned than ever before to shape the administration's immigration and border security policies. The question is what he will do with the newfound position of authority. Will he be able to deliver for Trump, or, like so many before him, be the one to bear the blame for a failure to overcome intractable issues and legal hurdles? Former Sessions staffer
Before he entered Trump's universe, Miller was communications director to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama. Their hardline views on immigration often left them on the edges in the Senate, fighting broader bipartisan immigration reform efforts every step of the way.
""All I can think of is his non-stop emails telling us Jeff Sessions was coming to the floor to talk about some fringe thing the broader party disagreed with,"" one former GOP aide said, chuckling. ""Now he's the mainstream in this White House and he's got more power than he could've ever dreamed of.""
Miller's path to power began when he joined the still fledgling operation working to elect Trump in January 2016 as a policy adviser and speechwriter. He quickly developed a knack for channeling Trump's voice on the stump and became a core member of Trump's inner circle of aides.
After Trump was inaugurated, it took Miller less than a week to make his mark in the West Wing. He crafted an executive order alongside then-chief strategist Steve Bannon to ban travelers to the US from seven Muslim-majority countries -- a move that blindsided even some members of Trump's Cabinet.
Since then, Miller has influenced the administration's border and immigration policies and crafted the rhetoric to go along with it. Last summer, he played a key role in advocating for the administration's ""zero tolerance"" family separation policy. And he was instrumental in insisting the White House not budge in its demands for border wall funding before and during the government shutdown this winter.
Miller has at times pushed the bounds of his immigration authority. In the past, he attempted to direct then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Nielsen to take certain immigration actions, administration officials said.
""Kelly would say yeah, no, I'm the secretary -- that's not how this works,"" one administration official recalled.
In recent weeks Miller has ramped up his calls to mid-level officials at the Department of Homeland Security, administration officials said, berating them for not doing more to stem spiking immigration numbers at the border and directing them to take specific actions.
Vitiello, the ICE nominee, isn't the only official Miller has tried to push out. He has also openly complained about the department's general counsel, John Mitnick, and told Trump that L. Francis Cissna, the head of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, has proven unable to deliver results. While Miller played a critical role in ousting Nielsen -- often complaining about her to and with Trump -- she had few allies in the West Wing to begin with. View from Capitol Hill
On Capitol Hill, Miller is equal parts agitator and close ally. Republicans who have worked with him on immigration, particularly those supportive of his views on the issue, note what they perceive to be an encyclopedic knowledge of immigration laws -- a resource in the heated debates that have transpired with Democrats. But it can cut both ways, one senior GOP aide said: ""He remembers everything your boss has said or done on the issue. And he's got the goods to kill you on it if you take a new position that runs contrary to something you've proposed or voted on before.""
Miller drew the ire of a number of Senate Republicans in 2018 for his perceived role in blowing up a bipartisan immigration deal that would have granted legal status to undocumented immigrants who crossed into the US as children.
""As long as Stephen Miller is in charge of negotiating immigration, we are going nowhere,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told reporters at the time.
The debate, and legislative implosion that followed, served as a window for some GOP senators into how Miller operates. ""You didn't necessarily see him or hear from him directly,"" said one senator involved in the bipartisan talks. ""But you knew he was always there, always working, and always the last person in the president's ear.""
As to the most striking part of the process? ""He wouldn't give an inch,"" the senator said.
Miller's efforts to gut DHS's current leadership structure became the latest flashpoint between Miller and lawmakers -- with Republican senators in particular striking out at Miller.
Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley told the Washington Post that ""it would be hard for (Miller) to demonstrate he's accomplished anything for the President."" And South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the Republican majority whip, said amid the shakeup, he hopes there will be a check on Miller's influence.
""I do think his voice is influential and I hope it gets balanced out with other voices there,"" Thune told CNN.
Miller's status among Democrats is so baked in by this point that one top administration official attempted to make light of it.
During a meeting of bipartisan congressional staffers convened by Vice President Mike Pence during the government shutdown, two sources said, Miller walked through a series of potential deal points. When he was done, Kushner looked at the Democratic staffers in the group.
""See? He's not so bad!"" Kushner exclaimed.
There were a few chuckles, the sources said, but mostly the Democrats in attendance shifted uncomfortably in their seats. White House operator
White House aides describe Miller as a subtle operator inside the West Wing. Rather than fighting it out with other aides in meetings with Trump, Miller tends to use his one-on-one moments with Trump to shape the President's thinking. Stephen Miller looks on as President Trump hosts a discussion on border security
""I think the thing people don't fully understand about Miller is that he works in the shadows,"" one former senior White House official said. ""He almost never speaks during meetings with POTUS when other staff members are there.""
There are other times though, when Miller is not so subtle.
During one meeting on border security last fall, Shahira Knight, Trump's legislative affairs director, was arguing that the administration should wait until after the midterm elections to push for border security funding, since it would be in a stronger position to do so. Miller cut her off mid-sentence, two people in the room said, shooting back a list of reasons why the administration would almost certainly be in a weaker position after the midterms, including that the Republicans were guaranteed to lose seats and possibly control of the House.
His outburst silenced the room, the two people said. One staffer, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss the interaction, described it as an ""evisceration.""
For Knight, whose job is to maintain the White House's relationship with lawmakers, Miller hasn't exactly been helpful, according to several people familiar with the situation.
Miller has avoided making enemies inside the White House, where his colleagues often tout his wry sense of humor. As one of the longest-tenured members of the President's inner circle, Miller has deftly moved between warring factions in a West Wing famous for back-biting. Early in the administration, he worked closely with Bannon to implement hard-right nationalist policies, including the travel ban. But as Bannon's fortunes began to turn , Miller sought to ingratiate himself with Kushner, who had had long been feuding with Bannon. Donald Trump fired Steve Bannon. But Bannon still won.
""Your polling numbers are actually very strong considering Steve won't stop leaking to the press and trying to undermine Jared,"" Miller told the President when he thought they were alone, according to former White House aide Cliff Sims' book ""Team of Vipers."" ""If Steve wasn't doing that, I bet you'd be ten points higher.""
Miller has also forged a close working relationship with Mulvaney. When Trump kept pushing for border closures, it was Miller and Mulvaney who huddled together to brainstorm how Trump could close parts of the border without devastating the economy. They suggested only closing certain ports of entry, stalling some trade instead of all and slow-walking entries into the US.
Miller and Mulvaney were also on the same side during the debate over whether Trump should declare a national emergency. Instead of telling Trump why he shouldn't, both encouraged him to do so and looked for ways to make it work. Just as Miller still operates with the same fringe tendencies he honed working for Sessions, Mulvaney still makes decisions like he's a member of the Tea Party, sources said. Can he deliver?
Some of the changes Trump has sought, such as denying migrants the ability to claim asylum once they cross into the US, remain illegal. And Miller will be constrained by those same laws.
""At the end of the day,"" a senior administration official said, ""the President refuses to understand that the Department of Homeland Security is constrained by the laws.""
But Miller is already working with other officials to develop workarounds to current laws, including developing policies to make it more difficult for people to obtain asylum protections by cracking down on the number of people deemed to have a ""credible fear"" of returning to their home country.
""The biggest issue is getting a hold of the credible fear system,"" a senior administration official said, arguing there is a ""cultural bias"" resulting in a high number of credible fear threats being approved. ""The purpose of the credible fear threat is not to ease path of meritless asylum seekers but to weed them out.""
Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that supports reduced immigration to the US, said he believes there are steps the Trump administration could still take to address the overcapacity situation at immigration detention centers and cut down on the number of border crossings.
But even though Krikorian said he believes empowering Miller will be a boon to his and the Trump administration's policy goals, he acknowledged limits to the impact Miller can have.
""There's no question that there's a limit to what they can do without changes from Congress. The question is how realistic are the President's expectations? Is he expecting them to solve this problem or is he expecting them to make some progress so that he can then go to the public and to Congress and say Congress has to do its part too?"" Krikorian said. ""That's kind of up to the President. That's not really something Stephen can do."" CNN's Lauren Fox, Pamela Brown and Jim Acosta contributed to this report "

Elisabeth Moss clarifies her Scientology beliefs - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Lisa Respers France,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/entertainment/elisabeth-moss-scientology/index.html,"(CNN) Elisabeth Moss knows that people think her starring role in ""The Handmaid's Tale"" seems counter to her being a Scientologist.
But the actress says it's complicated. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Moss was asked about her belief in Scientology and how that might be seen as ""being at odds with the themes"" in her hit Hulu drama as well as the show which made her famous, AMC's ""Mad Men."" ""Listen, it's a complicated thing because the things that I believe in, I can only speak to my personal experience and my personal beliefs,"" she said. ""One of the things I believe in is freedom of speech. I believe we as humans should be able to critique things."" Scientology has long been a controversial religion and has become even more so since former Scientologist and actress Leah Remini launched her popular A&E Network docuseries ""Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath."" Read More Leah Remini takes on Scientology in A&E series In it, the ""King of Queens"" star shares stories of those who say they were abused by the Church of Scientology, including being forced to cut off relationships with those who were not members. Church says Remini's show is only about money The Church of Scientology has denied such claims and a disclaimer from them runs throughout each episode of Remini's show. In 2017, the Church of Scientology r eleased a statement about the show's renewal for a second season. Leah Remini's Scientology series gets second season ""Leah Remini's show is and always has been about money. She teamed with A&E to shamelessly turn religious hate into a commodity by treating it as entertainment,"" the statement read in part. Moss told The Daily Beast she believes in freedom of the press and ""people being able to speak their own opinions."" ""I don't ever want to take that away from anybody, because that actually is very important to me,"" she said. ""At the same time, I should hope that people educate themselves for themselves and form their own opinion, as I have."" She also stressed that she is not anti-LGBTQ. Critics of the Church of Scientology have accused it of being anti-gay. ""It's like, it's a lot to get into and unpack that I can't do. But that is not my bag,"" Moss said. ""I am obviously a huge feminist and huge supporter of the LGBTQ community and believe so strongly -- I can't even tell you -- in people being able to do what they want to do, to love who they want to love, to be the person that they want to be -- whoever that is."" Moss said she believes her current show lines up with who she is. ""The things that I believe in personally, for me, 'The Handmaid's Tale,' and the ability to do something that is artistically fulfilling but is also personally fulfilling, I've never had that,"" she said. ""'The Handmaid's Tale' lines up so perfectly parallel with my own beliefs in freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the things that this country was actually built on."""
A new condom emphasizes consent by requiring four hands to open the package,us.cnn.com,"Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/health/condom-consent-four-hands-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) It takes four hands to open this new condom, created by an Argentine company in a bid to highlight the importance of consent.
The ""Consent Pack"" of condoms was designed by ad agency BBDO Argentina for Tulipan, a company which sells adult toys and condoms. ""If it's not a yes, it's a no,"" and ""Without consent there is no pleasure"" says the tagline in the promotional video, along with the hashtag #PlacerConsentido, or ""permitted pleasure."" ¬øPor qu√© esta cajita solo se puede abrir de a dos?

The condom is limited edition for now and being given to bar customers and attendees of events around Buenos Aires. But Tulipan plans to sell it online in the future. The pack comes after a survey of 30,000 people conducted by AHF Argentina , which campaigns for HIV treatment and services, revealed that 20.5% of Argentine men never use protection, 65% occasionally use condoms and only 14.5% regularly use them."
High school principal dies after making a bone marrow donation to save a stranger,us.cnn.com,"Gianluca Mezzofiore and Carma Hassan, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/health/principal-bone-marrow-donation-stranger-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) A high school principal has died after going to the hospital to donate bone marrow to try to save the life of a 14-year-old in France.
Derrick Nelson, principal of Westfield High School in New Jersey, died unexpectedly Sunday night, according to school officials. His fianc√©e, Sheronda Braker, said that Nelson suffered complications after his bone marrow donation. The school's newspaper reported in February that Nelson decided to donate his bone marrow to a boy in France after being contacted by Be the Match . The national bone marrow donor program told him that his blood might be a match. ""If it's just a little bit of pain for a little bit of time that can give someone years of joy, it's all worth it,"" Nelson told the paper then. In a statement to CNN, Braker said Nelson ""was a tremendous father to our beloved daughter Morgan and the best companion and life partner I could have ever asked for."" Read More ""He loved his family almost beyond belief. He was a man who carried himself with dignity, courage and compassion,"" she continued. ""His last kind and generous act on this earth in giving so someone else might live is a true testament to who he was and how he should always be remembered. We will always love him."" in a letter to parents, Westfield Public Schools Superintendent Margaret Dolan said, ""Dr. Nelson touched us all with his kindness, compassion, integrity, and endlessly positive attitude. ""We hold him and his family in our hearts as we grieve this loss together and I know you join me in granting his family the privacy they have requested."" Nelson, 44, served in the US Army Reserve for more than 20 years, according to Dolan. He joined Westfield Public Schools in 2010 as the assistant principal of Roosevelt Intermediate School. He later was assistant principal and principal of Westfield High, which has more than 1,800 students. People praised Nelson as a committed educator and a role model with a strong moral compass. His friend Salim Sivaad, also known as Wayne Clemmons, an Atlanta-based musician, told CNN he received news of Nelson's death from a mutual friend. ""Derrick was my brother's college roommate and fraternity brother, and that's how I met him back in 1995,"" he said. ""I had not been in contact with him recently. That's why it was such a shock. ... I didn't know he was donating or had the complications before he passed."" (3) It turns out Derrick's death was no less heroic, and ultimately tragic. My friend died trying to save the life of a child...a total stranger who he'd never met from a foreign land. Derrick died as a result of complications while donating life-saving bone marrow.

And I think he served as a great role model."" Westfield Mayor Shelley Brindle said on Facebook that her family was ""devastated"" to hear the news. ""This is a tremendous loss for our community, and I know that our children, and we as parents, will struggle with coming to terms with this over the coming days and weeks,"" she said. ""He was a man of immense character and kindness, and his legacy will live on in the generations of students whose lives he touched."" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy called the principal's final act ""one of selflessness."""
Technology that never stops looking for missing and exploited children,us.cnn.com,"Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/health/missing-exploited-children-technology/index.html,"(CNN) When John Shehan joined the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 1999, people looking to create and share child sexual abuse material online belonged in the dark corners of the internet, he said. They had to purchase digital cameras and video recorders, wait on slow dial-up connections to upload content and find designated chat rooms with like-minded individuals.
Today, children can be easily photographed and recorded on mobile phones, high-speed internet has become available around the world, and social networking sites have gained popularity. All of this has made it easier to create and share child sexual abuse material, explained Shehan, who is now the vice president of the center's Exploited Children Division. Heartbreak all over again for Timmothy Pitzen's family ""It's a much more interconnected world now,"" he said. But the same interconnection that puts children at risk is now being used to find them when they go missing, and rescue them when they're being exploited. The old way: Posters and faxes distributed locally Read More Years ago, when a child was reported missing, the search involved creating posters and fliers that were distributed in the neighborhood and then faxed them to other jurisdictions if officers believed that the child may have been taken elsewhere, Shehan explained. ""Back in 1984, John Walsh, our founder, used to talk about how it was easier to track and find a missing car or a horse than it was a missing child,"" he said. The system was cumbersome and not well-connected, he added. Missing children, perception vs. reality Beyond paper fliers, law enforcement around the world did not have established systems to share the information online. ""Twenty years ago, we realized many law enforcement agencies did not know how to create websites or photos of missing kids online,"" said Caroline Humer, director of the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The organization has since created a system, known as the Global Missing Children Network Engine or GMCNgine, that allows law enforcement in 29 member countries to quickly create electronic posters in their local language. The posters are just one part of what the GMCNgine has become. The new way: Geotargeting, facial recognition and engines that never give up ""We wanted to build an engine that allows law enforcement to explain to these families that there is a system out there that will never stop looking for your child,"" Humer said. The engine ""never ends, never sleeps, never gives up; it never has a change of shift. It is a system that essentially runs 24/7, 365 days until the child is found ... regardless of how long the child has been missing."" Once the GMCNngine creates a poster with a missing child's information, it submits it to both local law enforcement and the Federation for Internet Alerts, which then sends an alert to everyone in the geographic region where the child is believed to be missing. It works by taking over advertisement space on individual websites, explained Jason Bier, president of the Federation for Internet Alerts. As people browse the web, rather than seeing an ad for clothes or shoes, they see an alert about a missing child. ""We have links in the alerts that, if you click them, you can look at a missing child poster,"" he said. ""We see millions of people that have looked at posters as a result."" In addition to the alerts, the GMCNgine uses facial recognition software to search for pictures matching that of the missing child. The global nature of the engine is particularly important, Humer explained, adding that a child can go missing at any time, anywhere, regardless of background, income or demographic. Similarly, the internet knows no boundaries, she added. Facial recognition software has recently come under scrutiny for some of its biases in identifying women and people of color. The American Civil Liberties Union has also raised privacy and effectiveness concerns. But Humer says artificial intelligence, and specifically facial recognition software, is used to narrow the field and keep investigators from having to comb through thousands of photos. Investigators then look at all the images the software presents as leads. Similar software is used to find exploited children who may or may not be missing. Finding trafficked children In recent years, technology companies have stepped up to help law enforcement find children who are trafficked online. One of these is Thorn, a startup that partnered with the technology company Digital Reasoning to create a sex trafficking investigation tool known as Spotlight.
According to a survey conducted by the company in 2012, 75% of child sex-trafficking survivors had been sold online, most through escort websites. Spotlight finds images of minors in those ads, again helping law enforcement work through cases faster. ""We build software to help those in the front lines do their job better,"" said Julie Cordua, CEO of Thorn. Since its launch four years ago, Spotlight has helped officers in the United States and Canada open more than 21,000 trafficking cases and identify about 18,000 victims, including more than 6,000 children, according to the company's data. Spotlight and the GMCNgine work separately: One looks for exploited people, including children, and the other looks for missing children. ""What we do hope in the future is that we can connect these two together to make sure that if a child is missing and is being trafficked, our systems will pick that up,"" Humer said. ""That is the challenge for law enforcement. They only have one piece of the puzzle, so we are trying to give them as many pieces to put it all together."""
Patagonia sues Anheuser-Busch for selling beer that bears its name - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Jordan Valinsky, CNN Business",04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/business/patagonia-anheuser-busch-lawsuit-trnd/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Clothing company Patagonia is suing Budweiser's parent company for selling a beer that bears its name and evokes its rugged, environmentally friendly brand and logo.
AB InBev was granted a trademark to sell Patagonia beer in the United States in 2012, but the company sat on the name until 2018, when it started selling beer with the branding. Patagonia, the clothing company, accuses AB InBev ( BUD ) of trademark infringement for copying the brand's name and aesthetic on its beer. AB's Patagonia beer packaging includes a silhouette of a mountain and the word Patagonia in bold lettering. What's worse, the clothing company said, is AB InBev has been selling the brew and its own Patagonia-branded apparel at pop-up stores at ski resorts, which is Patagonia clothing territory, the company said in the suit. ""In short, AB has done everything possible to make it appear as though this PATAGONIA beer is sold by Patagonia."" Read More The company said that AB InBev ""has gone as far as creating a logo that is strikingly similar to Patagonia's famous mountain silhouette logo that has appeared continuously for decades on millions of products."" In a short emailed statement to CNN, an AB InBev spokesperson wrote the company will fight the lawsuit. ""We are aware of this lawsuit and believe it to be without merit. We will vigorously defend our trademark rights."" Patagonia also takes issue with InBev's environmental focus, which used a placard describing ""Patagonia's 'tree positive' mission,"" at the pop-up stores. Patagonia launched Long Root beer, while AB InBev launched Patagonia beer. AB InBev ""tried to connect its beer with environmental conservation by claiming to plant a tree for each case of beer sold, an initiative that Patagonia would welcome but for the fact that AB is clearly attempting to copy Patagonia's famous brand identity to confuse consumers,"" it said in the lawsuit. The clothing company launched its own beer in 2016 called Long Root pale ale. ""AB's activities have caused consumer confusion in the marketplace. Consumers have, for example, attributed AB's PATAGONIA beer to Plaintiffs,"" the suit alleges. Patagonia said in the lawsuit that AB InBev even had a company representative contact its food subsidiary, Provisions, seeking an ""interview"" about the Kernza grain used in its Long Root Ale. Patagonia, the clothing company, wants AB to stop selling the beers and to prevent it from going to ""such great lengths to pass itself off as Patagonia."" Patagonia says their brand was created in the 1960's and is registered in 90 countries. Anheuser-Busch has been taking steps recently to improve its environmental standing. Last year, it announced that it bought 800 hydrogen powered semi trucks as part of a bid to make its entire fleet of long-haul trucks run on ""clean energy."" It also placed an order for 40 Tesla plug-in semi trucks."

The fossils belonged to two adults and one child who lived between 50,000 and 67,000 years ago.
This time frame means luzonensis would have lived at the same time as Neanderthals, Denisovans, Homo sapiens and the small-bodied Homo floresiensis.

During excavations in 2011 and 2015, researchers found 12 additional hand and foot bones, including a partial femur and teeth, in the same layer of the cave. The researchers have named the new species luzonensis because of where it was found on the island of Luzon. They are now the earliest human remains found in the Philippines. Previously, Homo sapiens remains were found on Palawan island and dated to between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago. But what makes luzonensis different from other species? It's all in the distinct premolar teeth, which vary considerably from anything identified in the other species belonging to the Homo genus. Callao Cave on Luzon island, where the fossils were discovered. Read More The seven premolars and molars are smaller and more simplified than those of other species. Although some of the characteristics can be compared to Homo erectus and Homo sapiens, the teeth and jaw features remain distinct as far as the odd features they combine. This factor, along with the fact that the researchers haven't been able to remove DNA from the fossils, makes it difficult to determine where luzonensis fits, evolution-wise. 'Missing link' in human history confirmed after long debate The two hand bones and three foot bones also show a unique anatomy. Although separated by millions of years of evolution, luzonensis' toe bone strongly resembles that of Australopithecus afarensis, or the famed "" Lucy "" fossil. Australopithecus lived between 2.9 million and 3.9 million years ago. The finger bone also resembles that of Australopithecus, as well as early Homo species. The finger and toe bones are curved, like those of early hominins, likely suggesting that climbing was important to their lifestyle and survival. ""If you take each feature one by one, you will also find it in one or several hominin species, but if you take the whole combination of features, no other species of the genus Homo is similar, thus indicating that they belong to a new species,"" said Florent D√©troit, study author and paleoanthropologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. Complications in the evolutionary tree Luzonensis presents a bit of a mystery because, as with the discovery of Homo floresiensis, previously unknown hominin species complicate the evolutionary tree. This also shifts the idea of which species migrated. How did Lucy, our early human ancestor, die 3 million years ago? Given that Africa is regarded as the ""Cradle of Life"" and Homo erectus was found on the Indonesian island of Java, the idea is that erectus migrated out of Africa and helped disperse the species. Floresiensis , nicknamed the ""hobbit"" species, have been found only on the island of Flores near Indonesia and were discovered in 2003. They lived between 100,000 and 60,000 years ago. And although they stood only around 3¬Ω feet tall and had brains about one-third the size of a modern human's, they made stone tools and hunted elephants. It is believed that floresiensis was more diminutive in stature due to its island environment and limited resources. The same may be true for luzonensis, the researchers said. Both of these species lived on islands that would have been reachable only by crossing the sea. And there is evidence of animal butchery on Luzon that dates back 700,000 years, but the researchers don't know whether luzonensis is responsible. The finding does build the case that hominins were already present on the island. They could have been luzonensis or the species descended from them, or perhaps they descended from another unknown group, the researchers said. This is how the 'Hobbits' of Indonesia became so small Seafaring could have happened by accident as they drifted on rafts or due to intentional navigation, the researchers said. ""We have more and more evidence that they successfully settled on several islands in the remote past in Southeast Asia, so it was probably not so accidental,"" D√©troit said. ""Another important thing to have in mind is that you cannot successfully settle on an island with a single event of arrival of only few people, you need several individuals of course, and you need several arrivals, at least at the beginning, so that you have enough founders settled on the island."" More exploration to come So how did they evolve, and why do they share such varied characteristics with more ancient hominins? The answer may lie in more excavations and discoveries yet to be made on the islands of Southeast Asia. ""Our picture of homin evolution in Asia during the Pleistocene just got even messier, more complicated and a whole lot more interesting,"" Matthew Tocheri wrote in an accompanying News and Views article. Tocheri, the Canada Research Chair in Human Origins at Lakehead University in Ontario, did not participate in this study. The researchers are planning studying the biomechanical aspects of the fossils and how they may have moved, as well as more excavations of the cave or identifying new potential sites. ""As we can see now, Southeast Asia, and especially their islands, is a fantastic place for studying hominin evolution, and conducting fieldwork to find more sites with ancient archaeology and hominin fossils,"" D√©troit said."

Are we at risk for an anthrax attack? 01:07 Anthrax outbreaks in wildlife and livestock often stir concern because the disease can spread to humans who might come in contact with an infected animal or eat meat or drink milk from an infected animal. In people, anthrax can be fatal if left untreated, and symptoms depend on the type of infection , such as small blisters for cutaneous anthrax; fever and chills for inhalation anthrax; or sore throat and nausea for gastrointestinal anthrax. ""Visitors to our park are at no risk if they observe park rules on avoiding contact with wild animals and we encourage them to continue with their tours,"" Susan Koech, principal secretary of Kenya's State Department of Wildlife , said in a news release Monday. The first case in the outbreak was confirmed to be anthrax last week; the death was reported March 29, according to the release. Read More The release also noted that the outbreak has been contained and officials are monitoring the situation. A team of veterinarians and park rangers is vaccinating animals to prevent further spread of the disease. The park lost buffalo and rhinos in 2015 in a similar anthrax outbreak. Sporadic cases of anthrax occur in animals worldwide, and there are occasional outbreaks in Africa and central Asia, according to the World Health Organization . Before the use of veterinary vaccines, anthrax was a major cause of deadly disease in livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, camels, horses and pigs throughout the world.

Hide Caption 8 of 8 ""Having contact with animals that have died from anthrax is actually the most common route for humans to become infected with anthrax,"" said Caitlin Cossaboom , an epidemic intelligence service officer in the Bacterial Special Pathogens Branch at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Anthrax is difficult to control, and outbreaks can be very difficult to predict,"" she said. ""A seasonal pattern of anthrax outbreaks has actually been described, particularly related to cycles of heavy rainfall that are followed by periods of drought when it's very dry and hot."" One massive anthrax outbreak among wildlife in Namibia killed more than 200 hippopotamuses and Cape buffalo between September and December 2017, putting people and livestock at huge risk of becoming infected. In that case, even though more than 1,000 people were identified as having contact with or consuming meat from animals involved in the outbreak, there were no reported human cases or deaths. The details about how humans were protected in the outbreak are shared in a paper led by Cossaboom and published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases on Wednesday. The key to keeping anthrax away from humans Dozens of hippopotamus and Cape buffalo carcasses were found along the Kavango River in Bwabwata National Park in Namibia in fall 2017, the first eerie evidence of that anthrax outbreak. Namibia's Ministry of Environment and Tourism, the Ministry of Health and Social Services and the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry worked together to contain the outbreak. The CDC also helped the Namibian ministries. The CDC worked closely with Namibia to collect specimens from affected wildlife carcasses for use with the newly developed Active Anthrax Detect Rapid Test. The paper described this use of the test in the field as ""successful."" How prepared is the US for an anthrax attack? Namibia's Ministry of Health and Social Services developed and administered a questionnaire to identify people living in communities adjacent to Bwabwata National Park who were exposed to the carcasses. Through the questionnaire, 1,050 people were identified as having contact with or consuming meat from the carcasses, according to the paper. They were immediately provided with post-exposure prophylactic antibiotics. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry secured about 10,000 doses of livestock anthrax vaccine and administered the vaccines to prevent spillover of anthrax from wildlife to susceptible domestic animals -- and subsequently to humans. ""Anthrax is only one of many, many diseases that are zoonotic, meaning they can be spread between animals and humans,"" Cossaboom said. ""Some examples of this include rabies, which can be spread through bites from infected animals to humans, and rabies, also like anthrax, can be controlled by controlling it in animals."" As prevention efforts were employed, the Ministry of Environment and Tourism started removing all of the dead animal carcasses from the Bwabwata National Park. ""The response in this outbreak -- including rapidly identifying people that had been exposed to the dead animals, providing them with antibiotics post-exposure and then starting the community engagement to raise awareness on what was going on -- was so critical,"" Cossaboom said. ""All of those actions together -- or this really rapid multisectorial response -- was the key to having a successful outcome,"" she said. ""Fortunately, because of all of those efforts and the rapid response, there were no human cases, despite over 1,000 people being exposed in this case."" 'Human risk always exists' The paper shows how a fast-acting multidisciplinary approach can prevent an outbreak in wildlife from becoming an outbreak in humans, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and member of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, who was not involved in the research. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
""Human risk always exists with anthrax outbreaks in animals,"" Adalja wrote in an email. ""Anthrax is a zoonotic disease with human cases often tied to animal exposure. For example, multiple cases have occurred at African drumming events when individuals were exposed to animal drum skins that contained anthrax spores,"" he said. ""Because of the risk of spillover into humans, it is crucial to monitor animal anthrax outbreaks and delimit the exposure of humans while promptly administering post-exposure antibiotics to those exposed. It is also important to emphasize Anthrax is a major biowarfare threat and being prepared for outbreaks of animal origin directly enhances abilities to respond to a potential bioattack using anthrax."""
"Speak up about Cain worries, McConnell advises Republicans",us.cnn.com,Haley Byrd,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/republicans-trump-cain-moore-federal-reserve/index.html,"(CNN) Senate Republican leaders are sending a message to members troubled by President Donald Trump's controversial Federal Reserve picks: Speak up.
During Tuesday afternoon's Senate Republican lunch, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell advised senators concerned about Trump's selection of former presidential candidate and pizza executive Herman Cain and conservative economic commentator Stephen Moore to share their views with the White House now, before Trump officially moves forward with the nominations, a source familiar with the remarks told CNN. Why politicizing the Federal Reserve could have dangerous consequences GOP senators are worried about various controversies swirling around the two men -- particularly Cain, who faced sexual harassment allegations that effectively ended his 2012 presidential campaign -- but also that Trump's nominees could weaken the independence of the Fed, the world's most powerful central bank. Aiming to avoid a public fight over the confirmation, some Republicans hope to persuade Trump to reconsider ahead of Cain's official nomination. It's unclear how effective the strategy will be at convincing the President, who has been outwardly enthusiastic about the picks, though top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett earlier this week told reporters the nominations are still being vetted and are not done deals. Read More Trump said Wednesday morning that Cain ""will make that determination"" about whether to formally enter the confirmation process. ""Well, I like Herman Cain, and Herman will make that determination. Herman is a wonderful man, he's been a supporter of mine for a long time. He actually ran a very good campaign and that's up to Herman,"" the President told reporters outside the White House. Trump continued, ""Herman is, you know, he's already sat on one of the Fed Boards. And he's just somebody I like a lot, as to how he's doing in the process, that I don't know. You go through the process, but Herman's a great guy and I hope he does well."" Publicly, McConnell and other Republicans are projecting neutrality. ""Well, we are going to look at whoever the President sends up,"" McConnell said in a news conference Tuesday after the lunch. ""It's his choice to decide, and once he makes a nomination, we'll take a look at it."" In hallway interviews with nearly 20 Republican senators on Tuesday, most were reluctant to candidly discuss Cain's potential nomination. Many said they hadn't heard the days-old news that Trump was planning to select him. Others opted to withhold comment, while some expressed vague reservations. A few rejected the prospect outright. ""No,"" Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado quickly responded when asked if he would support Cain. ""It's not about his past. It's about who I think should be on the board,"" the senator explained. ""So that's that."" Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah has been openly critical of the idea as well. ""I don't think Herman Cain will be on the board of the Federal Reserve,"" the freshman senator told reporters Tuesday. ""It's important that the board be comprised of people who are academics, economists, and not people who are highly partisan."" Sen. Pat Roberts, like the majority of his colleagues, was slightly more diplomatic. ""When you first meet Herman Cain, he's very impressive,"" the Kansas Republican said. ""But whether he's qualified to be on the Fed, I just don't know."" Republicans are wary of Cain, a former CEO of Godfather's Pizza who served as chair of the Kansas City Fed, for a variety of reasons. Four women have said Cain harassed them during the 1990s, when he led the National Restaurant Association. Cain denied the allegations, most recently in a video posted last weekend. ""It's all just sort of a vague memory right now, but it's hard not to hear 'Herman Cain' in the context of something like this and not immediately recall some of those challenges,"" Sen. Kevin Cramer said of the harassment allegations. The North Dakota Republican told reporters those allegations would factor into his decisions as a member of the Senate committee that evaluates Fed nominees. Opponents also take issue with Cain's founding role in the pro-Trump political action group America Fighting Back. But several GOP senators on Tuesday pushed back on critics, saying Cain was qualified for the job. ""He has an impressive background in business and understands the importance that our economy plays in everyday lives,"" Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina told CNN. Scott shrugged off the idea that Cain is an unconventional choice: ""This has been an unconventional presidency, so that's not unusual."" Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa told reporters Tuesday that he wouldn't make up his mind until after a confirmation hearing, but he didn't have ""any reason not to"" support Cain. Republicans are in a slightly better position to confirm contentious appointees than they were before the 2018 midterm elections, with their new majority of 53, but they can still afford to lose only a few votes before any nomination would be doomed. That concern prompted Sen. John Cornyn of Texas on Tuesday to warn the White House to consult in advance with Senate leaders on nominations like these. Trump's endorsement of Cain came just weeks after the President announced he would nominate Moore, best known as a Wall Street Journal commentator, to the seven-member board. (Moore was also a CNN contributor.) The selection drew fire from Democrats, who said Moore was too partisan and was unqualified for the job. The two nominees' backgrounds in conservative politics have stoked fears about politicizing the Fed, even among Trump's GOP allies in Congress, after months of the President publicly railing against Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman he appointed, and the board's decision to raise interest rates late last year. Trump breaks precedent again with latest Fed pick ""I am concerned about that,"" Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said on Tuesday. ""The worst thing you can do in terms of your economy is to politicize or give the appearance that you're politicizing your central bank."" Moore has long run in Republican circles. He helped start the conservative Club for Growth and is a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation. He has recently been a vocal critic of the Fed leadership, siding with Trump on keeping interest rates low. And he has already garnered support among a number of leading GOP senators, who say they believe he will win enough votes -- something they won't say about Cain. ""Well, I know him better and I expect he'll be confirmed,"" Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, said of Moore, after sidestepping questions about Cain. Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby echoed that sentiment, praising Moore. ""Stephen Moore, I know well. I've worked with him. He does have a lot of experience in the area,"" said Shelby, an Alabama Republican. As for Cain's chances, he added, ""That will be a more interesting nomination."""
Stephen Miller: How he tightened his grip over Donald Trump's immigration and border policy,us.cnn.com,Jeremy Diamond,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/stephen-miller-tightens-grip-on-immigration-border-policy/index.html,"Washington (CNN) As President Donald Trump pushed his administration in recent weeks to take the drastic step of shutting down the US southern border, one key adviser fed Trump's impulse: Stephen Miller, the President's 33-year-old senior policy adviser and chief speechwriter who has long channeled Trump's hardline immigration views.
As most of the President's advisers sought to dissuade him from the idea, warning the economic consequences would be devastating, Miller encouraged the President to move forward with shutting down some ports of entry, two administration officials said. While Trump was ultimately convinced to back down, Miller's stance solidified his position in Trump's mind as the chief facilitator of the President's hardline instincts and appears to have won him more power. In the wake of that debate, Trump has moved to more formally empower Miller, telling aides in a recent Oval Office meeting that he was putting Miller in charge of all immigration and border issues, according to a person familiar with the meeting. In the days since, there has been a cascade of personnel moves inside the Department of Homeland Security. Last week, Miller convinced the President to pull the nomination of Ron Vitiello as the next director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, bluntly telling Trump that Vitiello was ""soft"" on closing the southern border. The decision blindsided department officials and Republican lawmakers, who initially thought it was a clerical error. Read More Two days later, Trump announced the forced resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Two days after that, Nielsen's deputy, Claire Grady, resigned under pressure to make room for the President's preferred pick for acting secretary, Kevin McAleenan, the Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner. How border hardliners nudged out Nielsen More turnover is anticipated -- giving Miller an expansive foothold to shape the administration's immigration policies and attempt end-runs around current laws. More than anyone in the West Wing, Miller has developed a mind-meld with the President on immigration, arguably his most important issue heading into the 2020 election. Where some advisers have sought to temper Trump's instincts, Miller has unabashedly stoked them, earning him a reputation around Washington as a radical and influential voice inside the White House. Administration officials caution that Miller is not some all-powerful and invisible hand driving every one of Trump's actions on immigration, as he is sometimes made out to be. The reality, they say, is more complex. While Miller goaded Trump on as he contemplated shutting down the US-Mexico border, the idea originated with Trump. And other advisers, including White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as well as senior adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, hold sway with Trump on immigration matters. Asked Wednesday morning about Miller's role, the President praised Miller, but sought to dispel any questions about who is really driving his immigration policy. ""Frankly, there's only one person that's running it. You know who that is? It's me,"" he said, pointing to his head. Minutes later, Miller responded to CNN's request for comment from the previous day: ""Only one person in this U.S. government runs immigration policy: President Donald Trump."" Still, Miller now finds himself in the driver's seat and better positioned than ever before to shape the administration's immigration and border security policies. The question is what he will do with the newfound position of authority. Will he be able to deliver for Trump, or, like so many before him, be the one to bear the blame for a failure to overcome intractable issues and legal hurdles? Former Sessions staffer Before he entered Trump's universe, Miller was communications director to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama. Their hardline views on immigration often left them on the edges in the Senate, fighting broader bipartisan immigration reform efforts every step of the way. ""All I can think of is his non-stop emails telling us Jeff Sessions was coming to the floor to talk about some fringe thing the broader party disagreed with,"" one former GOP aide said, chuckling. ""Now he's the mainstream in this White House and he's got more power than he could've ever dreamed of."" Miller's path to power began when he joined the still fledgling operation working to elect Trump in January 2016 as a policy adviser and speechwriter. He quickly developed a knack for channeling Trump's voice on the stump and became a core member of Trump's inner circle of aides. After Trump was inaugurated, it took Miller less than a week to make his mark in the West Wing. He crafted an executive order alongside then-chief strategist Steve Bannon to ban travelers to the US from seven Muslim-majority countries -- a move that blindsided even some members of Trump's Cabinet. Since then, Miller has influenced the administration's border and immigration policies and crafted the rhetoric to go along with it. Last summer, he played a key role in advocating for the administration's ""zero tolerance"" family separation policy. And he was instrumental in insisting the White House not budge in its demands for border wall funding before and during the government shutdown this winter. Miller has at times pushed the bounds of his immigration authority. In the past, he attempted to direct then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Nielsen to take certain immigration actions, administration officials said. ""Kelly would say yeah, no, I'm the secretary -- that's not how this works,"" one administration official recalled. In recent weeks Miller has ramped up his calls to mid-level officials at the Department of Homeland Security, administration officials said, berating them for not doing more to stem spiking immigration numbers at the border and directing them to take specific actions. Vitiello, the ICE nominee, isn't the only official Miller has tried to push out. He has also openly complained about the department's general counsel, John Mitnick, and told Trump that L. Francis Cissna, the head of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, has proven unable to deliver results. While Miller played a critical role in ousting Nielsen -- often complaining about her to and with Trump -- she had few allies in the West Wing to begin with. View from Capitol Hill On Capitol Hill, Miller is equal parts agitator and close ally. Republicans who have worked with him on immigration, particularly those supportive of his views on the issue, note what they perceive to be an encyclopedic knowledge of immigration laws -- a resource in the heated debates that have transpired with Democrats. But it can cut both ways, one senior GOP aide said: ""He remembers everything your boss has said or done on the issue. And he's got the goods to kill you on it if you take a new position that runs contrary to something you've proposed or voted on before."" Miller drew the ire of a number of Senate Republicans in 2018 for his perceived role in blowing up a bipartisan immigration deal that would have granted legal status to undocumented immigrants who crossed into the US as children. ""As long as Stephen Miller is in charge of negotiating immigration, we are going nowhere,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told reporters at the time. The debate, and legislative implosion that followed, served as a window for some GOP senators into how Miller operates. ""You didn't necessarily see him or hear from him directly,"" said one senator involved in the bipartisan talks. ""But you knew he was always there, always working, and always the last person in the president's ear."" As to the most striking part of the process? ""He wouldn't give an inch,"" the senator said. Miller's efforts to gut DHS's current leadership structure became the latest flashpoint between Miller and lawmakers -- with Republican senators in particular striking out at Miller. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley told the Washington Post that ""it would be hard for (Miller) to demonstrate he's accomplished anything for the President."" And South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the Republican majority whip, said amid the shakeup, he hopes there will be a check on Miller's influence. ""I do think his voice is influential and I hope it gets balanced out with other voices there,"" Thune told CNN. Miller's status among Democrats is so baked in by this point that one top administration official attempted to make light of it. During a meeting of bipartisan congressional staffers convened by Vice President Mike Pence during the government shutdown, two sources said, Miller walked through a series of potential deal points. When he was done, Kushner looked at the Democratic staffers in the group. ""See? He's not so bad!"" Kushner exclaimed. There were a few chuckles, the sources said, but mostly the Democrats in attendance shifted uncomfortably in their seats. White House operator White House aides describe Miller as a subtle operator inside the West Wing. Rather than fighting it out with other aides in meetings with Trump, Miller tends to use his one-on-one moments with Trump to shape the President's thinking. Stephen Miller looks on as President Trump hosts a discussion on border security ""I think the thing people don't fully understand about Miller is that he works in the shadows,"" one former senior White House official said. ""He almost never speaks during meetings with POTUS when other staff members are there."" There are other times though, when Miller is not so subtle. During one meeting on border security last fall, Shahira Knight, Trump's legislative affairs director, was arguing that the administration should wait until after the midterm elections to push for border security funding, since it would be in a stronger position to do so. Miller cut her off mid-sentence, two people in the room said, shooting back a list of reasons why the administration would almost certainly be in a weaker position after the midterms, including that the Republicans were guaranteed to lose seats and possibly control of the House. His outburst silenced the room, the two people said. One staffer, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss the interaction, described it as an ""evisceration."" For Knight, whose job is to maintain the White House's relationship with lawmakers, Miller hasn't exactly been helpful, according to several people familiar with the situation. Miller has avoided making enemies inside the White House, where his colleagues often tout his wry sense of humor. As one of the longest-tenured members of the President's inner circle, Miller has deftly moved between warring factions in a West Wing famous for back-biting. Early in the administration, he worked closely with Bannon to implement hard-right nationalist policies, including the travel ban. But as Bannon's fortunes began to turn , Miller sought to ingratiate himself with Kushner, who had had long been feuding with Bannon. Donald Trump fired Steve Bannon. But Bannon still won. ""Your polling numbers are actually very strong considering Steve won't stop leaking to the press and trying to undermine Jared,"" Miller told the President when he thought they were alone, according to former White House aide Cliff Sims' book ""Team of Vipers."" ""If Steve wasn't doing that, I bet you'd be ten points higher."" Miller has also forged a close working relationship with Mulvaney. When Trump kept pushing for border closures, it was Miller and Mulvaney who huddled together to brainstorm how Trump could close parts of the border without devastating the economy. They suggested only closing certain ports of entry, stalling some trade instead of all and slow-walking entries into the US. Miller and Mulvaney were also on the same side during the debate over whether Trump should declare a national emergency. Instead of telling Trump why he shouldn't, both encouraged him to do so and looked for ways to make it work. Just as Miller still operates with the same fringe tendencies he honed working for Sessions, Mulvaney still makes decisions like he's a member of the Tea Party, sources said. Can he deliver? Some of the changes Trump has sought, such as denying migrants the ability to claim asylum once they cross into the US, remain illegal. And Miller will be constrained by those same laws. ""At the end of the day,"" a senior administration official said, ""the President refuses to understand that the Department of Homeland Security is constrained by the laws."" But Miller is already working with other officials to develop workarounds to current laws, including developing policies to make it more difficult for people to obtain asylum protections by cracking down on the number of people deemed to have a ""credible fear"" of returning to their home country. ""The biggest issue is getting a hold of the credible fear system,"" a senior administration official said, arguing there is a ""cultural bias"" resulting in a high number of credible fear threats being approved. ""The purpose of the credible fear threat is not to ease path of meritless asylum seekers but to weed them out."" Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that supports reduced immigration to the US, said he believes there are steps the Trump administration could still take to address the overcapacity situation at immigration detention centers and cut down on the number of border crossings. But even though Krikorian said he believes empowering Miller will be a boon to his and the Trump administration's policy goals, he acknowledged limits to the impact Miller can have. ""There's no question that there's a limit to what they can do without changes from Congress. The question is how realistic are the President's expectations? Is he expecting them to solve this problem or is he expecting them to make some progress so that he can then go to the public and to Congress and say Congress has to do its part too?"" Krikorian said. ""That's kind of up to the President. That's not really something Stephen can do."""
Xerox is one of this year's top stocks CNN,us.cnn.com,Paul R. La Monica,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/investing/xerox-stock/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Investors are infatuated with hot, young, rapidly growing tech companies. So you might be surprised to learn that the second-best performer in the S&P 500 has been around for more than a century.
Xerox ( XRX ) , founded in 1906, is having quite a year: Its stock is up nearly 70% in 2019. Curiously enough, the best stock in the index is an even older company, cosmetics giant Coty ( COTY ) ‚Äî founded in 1904. What's behind Xerox's success? Does anyone really use photocopiers anymore? Xerox is soaring because it is making a bold bet to morph from a stodgy documents company into a more dynamic tech firm. Activist investor Carl Icahn has pushed Xerox to make changes and Icahn's hand-picked CEO John Visentin has made big moves, including a plan to turn Xerox into a holding company with separate operating units like Google parent company Alphabet ( GOOGL ) . Read More The first Xerox photocopiers came to market in the 1950s. Shareholders will vote on the proposal at the company's shareholder meeting on May 21. Xerox has said that converting to a holding company will make it easier to buy and incubate other businesses and to keep them at an arm's length from Xerox's core operations. Xerox should also be able to reduce its tax bill and protect some of its key patents more effectively as a holding company. The company clearly is banking on new growth opportunities to rejuvenate the overall business. Visentin said at Xerox's annual investor day event in February that it plans to focus more on software and services. Xerox's sales may not grow for another two years But the transformation is going to take some time ‚Äî and Xerox, despite the stock surge, is still a company that nobody will confuse with Google, Amazon ( AMZN ) , Netflix ( NFLX ) or other hot, momentum companies. Visentin has said that the goal is for Xerox to post flat to growing sales by 2021. Xerox's earnings per share are only expected to rise about 2% annually, on average, over the next five years. But that would be an improvement over the average decline in earnings of more than 5% a year over the past five years. Analysts are skeptical though. Of the five that still cover Xerox, three have ""hold"" ratings on the stock while the other two have it rated a ""buy."" The consensus price target on Xerox's stock is $35.50 -- just 7% higher than current levels. Xerox is making a bold bet to go it alone. The company had planned to merge with Japanese rival Fujifilm but the deal was abandoned last year after Icahn and another activist investor, Darwin Deason, sued to block it. New CEO has his work cut out for him As part of a settlement with Icahn and Deason, Jeff Jacobson stepped down as Xerox CEO and Visentin was installed in his place. Icahn had pressured former Xerox CEO Ursula Burns to spin off the company's business services division in 2017. That company, now known as Conduent ( CNDT ) , has fallen nearly 30% since the separation from Xerox. Icahn is Xerox's largest shareholder, with a more than 10% stake. Deason owns nearly 4% of Xerox, making him the company's fifth biggest investor. Institutional investing giants Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors are the second, third and fourth largest holders of Xerox. They own a combined stake of just under 20%. These investors have to be pleased with Xerox's latest stock gains. But it may be hard for Xerox to duplicate them until the company can prove that it can get sales growth back on track."

Via the store's security cameras, Jitendra Singh watched as a teen slyly pocketed items such as gum and candy. By the time Singh went into the main store area, the shoplifter was at the counter paying for a few items. ""I asked him, 'Take out whatever you have in your pocket,' so he took out one of the items,"" Singh told CNN. But Singh knew the teen had taken more. He told the boy to empty the rest of his pockets or he'd have to call the cops. Read More Surveillance video shows 7-Eleven owner Jitendra Singh confronting a shoplifter on Saturday night. When the store owner asked why he was stealing the merchandise, the teen said it was because he and his younger brother were hungry. At this point, an employee had a 911 operator on the phone -- but Singh told him to hang up. ""I said, 'Well that's not food. You're stealing gum and candies. That's just something for munching,'"" Singh said. ""I said, 'If you're hungry, ask me. I'll give you food.'"" Singh, who has owned the 7-Eleven in Toledo, Ohio, for five years, said his store offers pizza, chicken wings, taquitos, nachos and sandwiches -- all of which make for a much better meal. The store owner understood why the teen was stealing The store owner decided not to report the boy to the police. Instead, Singh gave him some real food and sent him on his way Saturday night. ""When he said, 'I'm hungry and that's why I'm stealing,' I said OK, he has some genuine problem. He's not a thief who's going and stealing stuff and selling it,"" Singh said. He didn't want the boy's life to be ruined for trying to feed himself and his family. ""At least (he) won't go to jail,"" Singh said. ""Once you go to jail, you'll have a criminal record later in life. You're not going to be able to get any good job or anything."" Customers are praising his generosity A customer who witnessed the incident posted about it on Facebook . The post has resonated with thousands of people, garnering more than 1,600 shares and 3,700 likes. Singh said he didn't expect his good deed to impact so many people. ""Customers are now coming back and saying, 'You're a good guy and you did a good thing,'"" Singh said. ""For me, it was not a big deal. ... I did what any normal human being would've done in that situation."""
Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley is writing a book about her time in Trump administration,us.cnn.com,Zachary Cohen,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/nikki-haley-book/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Nikki Haley, the former US Ambassador to the United Nations and Governor of South Carolina, is writing a book ""about her life and leadership"" that will come out this fall, her publisher announced Wednesday.
The book does not yet have a title, but in it, Haley ""will talk candidly about her tenure as UN Ambassador and the consequential actions, decisions, confrontations, and behind-the-scenes negotiations that shaped national and world events,"" according to a statement from St. Martin's Press. It will also describe personal experiences that ""shaped Haley's actions as governor and ambassador, as well as the challenges she and all women face when they assume roles traditionally occupied by men,"" the press release said. ""I was blessed to serve during some momentous times as Governor of South Carolina and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.

""She's done a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together. We've solved a lot of problems and we're in the process of solving a lot of problems,"" Trump said. Haley called serving as UN ambassador ""an honor of a lifetime,"" but added that it was time for her to depart the administration. ""There's no personal reason,"" she said, explaining her rationale for departing. ""It's very important for government officials to understand when it's time to step aside."" But a source familiar with the issue previously told CNN that financial considerations did come into play for Haley, something she alluded to in her resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. With one child in college and another heading there soon, Haley felt like she needs to make some money, the source said."

‚Äî Masters Tournament (@TheMasters) April 8, 2019 Even without Woods, the Masters is the one golf event even non golfers are glued to. It's a spring rite, a sporting spectacle at a revered venue layered in rich history and dripping in tradition. The vivid greens, ice-white sand of the bunkers and explosions of iridescent pinks and reds of blooming azaelas make for a brilliant backdrop, in stark contrast to the raffish Washington Road strip beyond the fence. It's a bucket-list event and the difficulty of getting tickets -- a yearly lottery offers a limited number of day passes, but the waiting list for weekly badges is long-since closed -- adds to the allure. For the players, Augusta places a premium on length and second-shot accuracy -- knowing where to miss is often touted as one of the keys -- while a sharp short game and deft putting stroke is required on the slick, sloping greens. When the tournament really hots up on Sunday afternoon, the roars accompanying great shots will explode like incendiaries and reverberate around the towering pines like nowhere else in golf. ""This is unlike any other golf tournament. It's just a very special place,"" said Woods.

‚Äî GOLFTV (@GOLFTV) April 7, 2019 Inclusion in golf's ultra elite club alongside Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Nicklaus and Woods would convey greatness, but Augusta has become McIlroy's semi nemesis. Since putting himself on the brink of the grand slam when he won the 2014 Open Championship, McIlroy has struggled to properly contend despite finishing in the top 10 each time. Last year, he began the final day three shots behind Patrick Reed in the final group but slipped back as the American clinched his first major.

Patagonia sues Anheuser-Busch for selling beer that bears its name,us.cnn.com,"Jordan Valinsky, CNN Business",04-11-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/business/patagonia-anheuser-busch-lawsuit-trnd/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Clothing company Patagonia is suing Budweiser's parent company for selling a beer that bears its name and evokes its rugged, environmentally friendly brand and logo.
AB InBev was granted a trademark to sell Patagonia beer in the United States in 2012, but the company sat on the name until 2018, when it started selling beer with the branding. Patagonia, the clothing company, accuses AB InBev ( BUD ) of trademark infringement for copying the brand's name and aesthetic on its beer. AB's Patagonia beer packaging includes a silhouette of a mountain and the word Patagonia in bold lettering. What's worse, the clothing company said, is AB InBev has been selling the brew and its own Patagonia-branded apparel at pop-up stores at ski resorts, which is Patagonia clothing territory, the company said in the suit. ""In short, AB has done everything possible to make it appear as though this PATAGONIA beer is sold by Patagonia."" Read More The company said that AB InBev ""has gone as far as creating a logo that is strikingly similar to Patagonia's famous mountain silhouette logo that has appeared continuously for decades on millions of products."" In a short emailed statement to CNN, an AB InBev spokesperson wrote the company will fight the lawsuit. ""We are aware of this lawsuit and believe it to be without merit. We will vigorously defend our trademark rights."" Patagonia also takes issue with InBev's environmental focus, which used a placard describing ""Patagonia's 'tree positive' mission,"" at the pop-up stores. Patagonia launched Long Root beer, while AB InBev launched Patagonia beer. AB InBev ""tried to connect its beer with environmental conservation by claiming to plant a tree for each case of beer sold, an initiative that Patagonia would welcome but for the fact that AB is clearly attempting to copy Patagonia's famous brand identity to confuse consumers,"" it said in the lawsuit. The clothing company launched its own beer in 2016 called Long Root pale ale. ""AB's activities have caused consumer confusion in the marketplace. Consumers have, for example, attributed AB's PATAGONIA beer to Plaintiffs,"" the suit alleges. Patagonia said in the lawsuit that AB InBev even had a company representative contact its food subsidiary, Provisions, seeking an ""interview"" about the Kernza grain used in its Long Root Ale. Patagonia, the clothing company, wants AB to stop selling the beers and to prevent it from going to ""such great lengths to pass itself off as Patagonia."" Patagonia says their brand was created in the 1960's and is registered in 90 countries. Anheuser-Busch has been taking steps recently to improve its environmental standing. Last year, it announced that it bought 800 hydrogen powered semi trucks as part of a bid to make its entire fleet of long-haul trucks run on ""clean energy."" It also placed an order for 40 Tesla plug-in semi trucks."

Jay Inslee takes on climate change in children's books - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Dan Merica,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/jay-inslee-childrens-books/index.html,"Washington (CNN) To the public, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has written just one book, a 2007 policy piece about the future of green energy.
But to his family, the 2020 Democratic candidate and grandpa is much more prolific. For the last 10 years, Inslee has written and illustrated one children's book a year for his three grandkids. A number of the books focus on nature, the climate and the effects the warming Earth has on the environment. They are a physical -- if not unique -- manifestation of the 2020 candidate's deep concern about climate change, the issue he has centered his campaign around -- and a way he can personally teach his three grandchildren about the impact humans can have on the world around them. ""These books are more for fun and being able to read to your grandkids. That is a treasure, that is priceless and that is why we wrote the books,"" Inslee told CNN on Tuesday. The books were, until now, a private display of how intensely Inslee, who will appear in a CNN town hall Wednesday night, worries climate change. The candidate focuses on the issue at nearly every event he headlines and launched his campaign earlier this year because he believes he is ""the only candidate who will make defeating climate change our nation's number one priority."" Read More Washington Gov. Jay Inslee works on illustrating children's books for his grandchildren. While his pitch to voters can sometimes feel more doom and gloom -- ""We're the first generation to feel the sting of climate change. And we're the last who can do something about it,"" Inslee said in his announcement video -- the books he writes to his grandchildren seek to uplift and inspire their help. Inslee -- ""Bobo"" to his grandchildren Brody, Chase, and Zoe -- gives the books to the kids at Christmas. Inslee's wife, Trudi -- or, as the grandchildren call her, ""Bee"" -- edits and publishes the books. ""I am responsible for (correcting) all the typos,"" Trudi Inslee said with a laugh. While the books often demonstrate Inslee's love of nature, his latest book zeroes in on climate change in a detailed way. Titled ""Elvis & the Elves: The Mystery of the Melting Snow,"" it tells the story of Elvis' attempts to get his friends to help stop the planet from warming before their snowman friend, Sammy, melts into nothing. ""They spotted a train carrying coal. It was Zoe's train, and it was making a lot of smoke. As it passed, Sammy's snow melted right off his snow body,"" Inslee writes in the book, beneath a picture of a train passing an elf. As Sammy melts, Elvis and his elf friends convince Zoe -- named after his granddaughter -- to let the elves build her an electric train and get rid of the coal powered locomotive. The new train helps reverse the warming and Sammy comes back to life. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee wrote the book ""Bears in the Boat"" for his grandchildren. ""From elves and snowmen to plants and animals, we all are impacted by climate change,"" reads the end of the book, which Inslee's campaign will soon make available online. ""We know removing one coal train from the tracks won't solve this problem. It's going to take a concentrated national mission to overcome this challenge.' ""These books could be something that grandparent or a parent might want to use to open the discussion with kids,"" Inslee said. ""The kids get it. They are closer to nature than they are. Thank goodness we have got them."" Inslee's Christmas book gifts began a decade ago. He noticed all the Santa figurines and statues on his mantle. He began to take photos of them and wrote a story -- titled ""Sammy and the Santas"" -- to go along with the pictures. And thus, a tradition was born: The governor and his grandkids read the book every Christmas and the kids have to search the house for each Santa mentioned. Inslee's love of drawing and painting -- the governor enjoys it so much, says Trudi Inslee, that he carries a watercolor set with him on the road -- has also become a part of the endeavor; later books feature illustrated cartoons from the governor himself. One of those books, titled ""Bears in a Boat,"" focuses primarily on the outdoors and a group of bears that paddled to the Washington State Capitol Building to receive an award from the bear governor named Chase -- after his grandson. ""The books show you the power of the imagination,"" Inslee said. ""Until this day, Chase believes we are both governors. He actually believes he is the backup governor."""
US conducts airstrike in Somalia as PM visits White House - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Ryan Browne,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/us-somalia-airstrike-prime-minister-visit/index.html,"(CNN) The US military conducted an airstrike in Somalia Tuesday that killed one Al-Shabaab militant, according to US Africa Command, which oversees military operations on the continent.
The strike occurred in the vicinity of Jilib, Middle Juba Region, an area that has in the past been a hotbed of Al-Shabaab activity. News of the strike comes on the same day that Somalia's Prime Minister Hassan Khayre met with President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton at the White House on Wednesday. US military acknowledges civilian casualties in Somalia for the first time Khayre is seen as a key ally in the fight against the al Qaeda affiliated Al-Shabaab ""Pleased to have hosted Somali PM Khayre today. I congratulated him on Somalia's economic reforms and urged sustained engagement on this front. We discussed ways to deepen the strong US-Somalia partnership on critical issues, including counterterrorism and regional stability,"" Bolton wrote on Twitter Wednesday following their meeting. Read More American diplomats, military officers, and USAID officials tell CNN that they see progress in Somalia, with many of them citing increased security in major cities and reform efforts as examples of success, which has been bolstered by recent reform efforts made by the government. Significant increase in strikes Trump 253 group have been killed in 29 Shabaab, killing about 337 militants. In The US military estimates that Al-Shabaab commands somewhere between 5,000 to 7,000 fighters and controls about 20% of Somalia's territory. As part of an effort to bolster Somalia's government, the US has about 500 troops in Somalia where they primarily advise the Somali National Army as it carries out its counter-insurgency campaign against Al-Shabaab. US special forces train troops in African nation facing twin terror threat That effort includes a Navy SEAL-led unit comprised of US Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps personnel that is currently in Somalia working to advise Danab, a light infantry force tasked with clearing Al-Shabaab from towns and villages from the insurgency's strongholds in Somalia, thereby denying its ability to conscript recruits and tax the local population. The US military took on responsibility for training and advising Danab in May of 2017. Since October 2013, the US military has also operated a Military Coordination Cell in Somalia's capital Mogadishu, which is tasked with providing planning and advisory support to Somali security forces and the Africa Union mission in Somalia, AMISOM. But despite the gains made by US-backed forces, Al-Shabaab has still been able to strike at the nation's capital, carrying out an attack last month that killed dozens. The terror group has also carried out attacks on US allies in the region, including a January attack on a hotel complex in Nairobi, Kenya. Criticism from Congress The increase in airstrikes against Al-Shabaab have been criticized by some members of Congress and outside groups like Amnesty International, which has Somalia. While the US military has rejected Amnesty's allegations, Africa Command did recently announce that it had determined that one of its drone strikes had killed two civilians, the first ever such acknowledgment by the US military in Somalia. ""I think we need to rethink our Somalia strategy,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said recently during confirmation hearings for Trump's nominee to become the next commander of Africa Command, Gen. Stephen Townsend. ""As best I can tell the strategy in Somalia, as it is in so many of the countries that the US is bombing, is to keep killing terrorists and militants and hope that one day there are magically no more terrorists or militants to kill,"" Warren said. But US military officers and diplomats stress that the airstrikes are only one component of the US military's overall campaign in Somalia which is aimed at bolstering the local government so that it can tackle Al-Shabaab on its own. ""In coordination with the Federal Government of Somalia's continued efforts to weaken al-Shabaab, U.S. forces conducted an airstrike in the vicinity of Jilib, Middle Juba Region, Somalia, on April 9, 2019... Continued pressure on the al-Shabaab network is critical to progress,"" US Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Gregg Olson, Africa Command's director of operations, said in a statement. ""Our assistance complements the Federal Government of Somalia's efforts to create stability and a better future for the Somali people,"" he added."
Elizabeth Warren's campaign announces $6 million first-quarter haul as it makes huge hires in early states - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,MJ Lee,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/elizabeth-warren-first-quarter-fundraising/index.html,"(CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised more than $6 million for her presidential bid in the first quarter of 2019 and has $11.2 million in the bank, her campaign announced Wednesday, as advisers tell CNN that Warren is making huge hires in the early states and preparing for a slog to the 2020 Democratic convention.
In an email to supporters, Warren's campaign manager Roger Lau said that more than 135,000 donors made over 213,000 contributions in the first three months of the year, with an average donation of $28. A significant chunk of her total haul -- more than $1.4 million -- came in during the final week of the quarter when the campaign received over 50,000 new donations, Lau said. Warren transferred $10.4 million from her Senate campaign account, according to aides, and she spent $5.2 million -- most of what she raised -- in the first quarter. Warren's fundraising haul falls well behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' $18.2 million, California Sen. Kamala Harris' $12 million, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke's $9.4 million, and is also shy of the $7 million announced by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Warren launched her exploratory committee on New Year's Eve and has had significantly more time than some of her competitors to raise cash, but her campaign has also not held a single fundraiser or solicited high-dollar checks. The number of people that gave to Warren's campaign -- more than 135,000 -- is not far off from the 138,000 contributors touted by Harris and the 158,000 announced by Buttigieg. (All three candidates are eclipsed by Sanders on this front -- he said 525,000 donors gave to his campaign since he entered the race in February. O'Rourke's campaign has not revealed its number of donors.) In conversations with CNN this week, Warren advisers painted a picture of a campaign that is laying the groundwork for a protracted battle for the Democratic nomination and anticipating the possibility that the Democratic contest turns into a 50-state scramble to pick up delegates. Warren has also focused heavily on ramping up operations on the ground, hiring scores of campaign staff and prioritizing human contact with voters in the field, aides said. Read More Elizabeth Warren's finance director leaving campaign The Warren campaign now has more than 170 full-time paid staff, according to aides, with about half of them deployed in the four early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Asked whether her campaign would adjust its game plan if her first quarter fundraising proved to be disappointing, the Massachusetts Democrat insisted in a brief interview with CNN last Friday: ""I'm running the campaign I want to run."" ""Instead of spending time with millionaire donors, I'm now at 12 states and Puerto Rico,"" Warren said, ""spending time with people who're going to build the grassroots energy for us to win in 2020 and to make the changes we need to make in 2021."" Warren vowed earlier this year that for the duration of the 2020 primary contest, she would not solicit any money from wealthy donors, including via fundraisers, receptions and phone calls. The decision led to the departure of her finance director Michael Pratt, a defection that appeared especially conspicuous given the tight-knit nature of Warren's inner circle of advisers. But the campaign, including Warren herself, has stood by the decision, casting it as philosophically in line with the senator's years-long crusade against big money in politics. The team has also described it as an important way of freeing up campaign resources, including the candidate's time, to focus on grassroots campaigning and organizing. Even with the emphasis on the early states, Warren advisers told CNN this week that the campaign is also pursuing a 50-state strategy. Ten months out from the Iowa caucuses, Warren's leadership team is currently looking far ahead on the 2020 calendar and mapping out opportunities to pick up delegates as it anticipates what could be a long slog to the convention. One telling sign: Brendan Summers, Sanders' Iowa caucus director in 2016 and a high-profile hire for Warren this cycle , is not based in Iowa. Instead, he's camped out at Warren's campaign headquarters in the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston, aides familiar with Summers' role told CNN. The campaign has been leaning heavily on Summers' expertise on delegate math, they said, in addition to his knowledge of the Iowa and Nevada caucuses. To that end, Warren has traveled to a dozen states and Puerto Rico in just over three months, at a stage in the election when plenty of her competitors are mostly sticking to a handful of early states. Next week, Warren plans to add two new states to her growing list -- Colorado and Utah. It is not an accident, aides noted, that last month, Warren campaigned in two states that don't vote until March 3 -- Alabama and Tennessee. The campaign said Warren has clocked in 48 campaign events so far this year. Doug Rubin, a veteran political strategist who has previously advised Warren, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and others, summed up the Warren campaign's strategy this way: ""Playing for the long-haul."" ""I think she's setting this up to be a significant, long-haul play,"" said Rubin, who is currently unaffiliated with any 2020 campaign. ""I lived through 2012 with her. She was behind in the polls early on to Scott Brown. People questioned whether she could do it -- and she just stayed very focused; she had a game plan."" But as the 2020 season heads into the next phase, Warren -- who, until a few months ago, was widely expected to be a frontrunner -- is lagging in the polls. A recent Quinnipiac survey had just 4% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters saying they would support Warren, putting her far behind former Vice President Joe Biden's 29%, Sanders' 19%, O'Rourke's 12% and Harris' 8%. Buttigieg also had 4% support. In Iowa, a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll in March showed Biden and Sanders leading the pack with 27% and 25% of support, respectively. Warren polled at 9%, followed by Harris at 7%. Warren's overarching challenge is not unique to her campaign: standing out in a crowded field of almost 20 Democratic candidates. Her aides point to Warren's dominance on policy as a major part of their long-term strategy to do exactly that. The senator has put forward far-reaching, progressive proposals, including a plan to tax the wealthiest Americans, break up tech giants and on universal child care. Warren's most recent call to end the legislative filibuster put her Senate rivals in the spotlight, forcing some of them to take a position on the divisive issue. One Iowa political operative who has been observing the Democratic candidates coming through their state this year, said that the next obvious moment for any of the White House hopefuls to stand out is the Democratic primary debates, which begin in June. ""If they can't develop some kind of excitement or rebirth when these debates begin,"" the operative said, ""it's going to be tough, and there's no denying that."""
Amazon employees write CEO Jeff Bezos - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Samantha Murphy Kelly,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/tech/amazon-climate-change-letter/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Amazon employees are putting pressure on the company to rethink how it contributes to the battle against global warming.
In a Medium post Wednesday published by a group called Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, more than 3,500 staffers urged CEO Jeff Bezos to publicly outline the company's plans to reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels. The letter follows two meetings between Amazon ( AMZN ) leadership and employees that delivered little clarity on the company's efforts, Rajit Iftikhar, an Amazon software engineer who co-signed the letter, confirmed to CNN Business. The employees, who list their names and titles at the bottom of the letter, said Amazon's ""sustainability goals lack context."" A recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called on businesses to cut emissions in half by 2030 and reach zero by 2050.

""We all ‚Äî individuals, corporations, governments ‚Äî simply need to do more. Amazon needs a company-wide plan that matches the scale and urgency of the climate crisis, and Shipment Zero is not nearly enough.""

""[It's] a fraction of our overall carbon footprint."" Amazon said its sustainability team is using ""a science-based approach to develop data and strategies to ensure a rigorous approach to our sustainability work,"" in a statement sent to CNN Business. ""We have launched several major and impactful programs and are working hard to integrate this approach fully across Amazon,"" the company said. ""Our dedication to ensuring that our customers understand how we are addressing environmental issues has been unwavering -- we look forward to launching more work and sharing more this year."" The company said it has 200 scientists, engineers, and product designers focused on sustainability efforts, from solar and wind farms to efforts around shipment waste . ""Earlier this year, we announced that we will share our company-wide carbon footprint, along with related goals and programs,"" Amazon said. The employees are also urging their company to stop offering its cloud business, Amazon Web Services, to industries such as oil and gas that are responsible for depleting vital fossil fuels. ""We're a company that understands the importance of thinking big, taking ownership of hard problems, and earning trust,"" the letter said. ""These traits have made Amazon a top global innovator but have been missing from the company's approach to climate change."" The letter comes about a month after hundreds of Amazon employees, in addition to investors and civil rights groups, urged the company to stop selling its Rekognition facial-recognition software to government agencies over concerns it could be used to violate people's rights."

He will see what happens,"" a spokesperson for Spielberg's production company, Amblin Entertainment, told IndieWire in February. Since then, the Academy has confirmed that they received a letter from the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, warning them against implementing rules that would potentially exclude films from companies like Netflix. De Niro agrees that the experience of going to the movies is still important, which is why ""The Irishman"" will also have a limited theatrical release. ""A lot of opportunity has come out of the Netflix thing. It's not so simple and I agree we have to have the theater format, it's so important. But I don't know, things move on in ways that we can't foresee,"" De Niro added. ""But the respect for the theater format venue whatever we have to try and hold on to."" The film, directed by Martin Scorsese, is a biographical crime story about labor union leader, Frank Sheeran, played by De Niro. The movie also stars Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel, Anna Paquin, Bobby Cannavale and Ray Romano. This will be De Niro and Scorsese's ninth film together. Their working relationship began in 1973 with ""Mean Streets,"" before they went on to make classics like 1976's ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" in 1980 for which De Niro won an Oscar, ""Goodfellas"" in 1990, ""Cape Fear"" in 1991, ""Casino"" in 1995, and more recently ""The Audition"" in 2015. De Niro said the reason they continue to work together is simple: Scorsese is open to taking chances. ""He's a very giving person who understands, is able to take ideas and run with them or encourage you to run with them and if they work they work but at least he will say, 'Yeah, let's do it, let's try it.'"" De Niro said of Scorcese. ""We do have a special relationship but he does that with everybody he works with creatively."""
Britney Spears is taking care of herself. Too many others can't (opinion),edition.cnn.com,Holly Thomas,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/opinions/britney-spears-mental-health-access-to-care-thomas/index.html,"Holly Thomas is a writer and editor based in London.

(CNN) When Britney Spears' mental health deteriorated in early 2008, the story dominated the news for weeks. Pictures of the wide-eyed, shaven-headed superstar saturated the internet, and a Rolling Stone cover story described Spears as being a toy we'd all grown tired of playing with, a ""perfectly proportioned twenty-six-year-old porcelain doll with a nasty weave."" Long after the episode had passed, the meme ""If Britney can survive 2007, you can handle today"" remained synonymous with the worst, most embarrassing kind of breakdown.
Holly Thomas After TMZ broke the news last week that Spears had checked herself into a mental health facility, the coverage, though extensive, was comparatively muted. The consensus (rightly) seemed to be that Spears, in the face of extreme stress, had done the responsible thing by seeking help. Many other celebrities expressed their support , and voiced to their fans the importance of getting the care you need . Spears, who announced earlier this year that she was taking some time out of the limelight to focus on her family, posted on her Instagram page last week: ""We all need to take time for a little 'me' time."" But for the non-rich and famous, seeking help for mental health issues in America is often fraught with complications which make a mockery of well-meant encouragement. According to new analysis of 300 emergency rooms published this week in JAMA Pediatrics and reported by CNN , the number of children aged 5-18 who arrived with suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts doubled from 580,000 to 1.12 million between 2007 and 2015. The average age of those evaluated was 13, and 43% of the children visiting were aged between 5 and 11. While previously suicidal behavior made up 2% of pediatric emergency room visits, it now accounts for 3.5%. JUST WATCHED Taraji P. Henson talks mental health with Van Jones Replay More Videos ...

Last year the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that suicide among adults has risen in nearly every state over the last 20 years, in half by as much as 30%. Depression and prior suicide attempts represent significant risk factors for suicide . Read More This is an emergency, but too often, the support millions of Americans need is not available. And, as always, the poorest are hardest hit. After the financial crisis in 2008, states cut mental health spending by billions of dollars . In 2014, a study published in JAMA Psychiatry found that therapists were the least likely medical providers to accept insurance. The percentage that did was ""significantly lower"" than physicians in other specialties like cardiology or dermatology. Therapy can cost hundreds of dollars per session, and is especially expensive in cities, where rates of depression are higher. Most of the United States faces a severe shortage of practicing child and adolescent psychiatrists, with fewer than 17 providers available per 100,000 children, according to data from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. ""Even though I'm able to afford sessions out of pocket now, they're extremely expensive when I have to do that and a lot of the places that I need to go to don't accept my insurance,"" Cori Siren, an entertainer and jewelry maker from Indiana told me. ""So, I'm left going to awful facilities that do accept my insurance and something always gets messed up."" Regardless of whether you have medical insurance or not, finding support can be a mission unto itself, and Siren's story echoes others' who struggle to find timely access to appropriate care. This problem, a longstanding issue, has only grown worse over the course of the Trump administration so far. The ancient ways suicide continues to haunt us In 2017, the Trump administration froze a federal database which had helped direct people to services and interventions to treat mental health disorders and substance abuse. The 2019 fiscal year budget requested $68.4 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services -- a 21% decrease from the budget enacted in 2017. In March, Trump supported a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. This is the latest in a series of attacks, with the administration having already given states powers to weaken Obamacare last October. About 30 million people covered would lose their health insurance if the Affordable Care Act was repealed without a replacement plan, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare dramatically increased access to care for conditions such as substance addiction in the most-affected states. The stress of seeking out evasive health care can have an impact over generations. Watching parents struggle with bills, drown in forms and sink into debt can put children off engaging with an unwelcoming system in their own adulthood, and exacerbate the effects of the original condition. When you have a mental illness, even the most perfunctory daily tasks can feel like mountains to climb, let alone making important phone calls or filling out complex paperwork. Though mental illness remains stigmatized, and to hugely varying degrees across race and wealth status , the conversation around it has evolved. The media is moving away from some of the derogatory language it used so thoughtlessly even a few years ago. But for those not wealthy enough to check into rehab facilities or access even basic care, the right words are far from enough to tackle a growing and dangerous problem. Stay up to date...

While there is undoubtedly value in seeing a beloved celebrity handle mental health issues as judiciously as Britney Spears has in recent weeks, the real lesson we should take is that against all sense and justice, mental health care in America remains for too many (and even more if the Trump administration has its way on healthcare policy) the domain of the privileged. Until that is addressed, for many, urges to seek help will remain a hollow echo."
Why we're still years away from a robocall-free future,edition.cnn.com,Adam Doup√© for CNN Business,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/perspectives/stop-robocalls-shaken-stir/index.html,"Adam Doup√© is an assistant professor in the School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering at Arizona State University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.
Despite all the recent advances telecom companies have made to detect and block spam calls and authenticate callers, we are still several years away from a robocall-free future.
Without technology that can authenticate who a caller is, a spammer can change their caller ID to any number they want without being caught. Scammers often use something called neighbor spoofing, where they make it look like they're calling from a phone number that has the same first five or six digits as your own. And, thanks to auto-dialers ‚Äî which are incredibly easy to use ‚Äî a spammer can automatically call a list of hundreds of numbers and deliver any voice content at the push of a single button. This can get sophisticated and employ modern AI techniques to make the call sound like a real human voice with the ability to adapt and respond to conversation. Or, it can be a pre-recorded message that eventually transfers the call to a human scammer once the victim has shown interest in whatever the caller is trying to interest them in. Luckily, recent technological and legislative efforts to address the robocall scourge are promising. New technology, such as the SHAKEN/STIR protocols , promise to finally add authentication to caller ID, closing the technical loophole that enables spoofing. SHAKEN/STIR allows the calling party's telecom provider to attach a digital certificate to the call message so that the receiving party can verify that the caller is who the caller ID says it is. Once authenticated caller ID is a reality, then anti-robocall apps that use caller ID will be much more effective. Furthermore, authenticated caller ID may finally put the trust back in the telephone system, so that when you receive a phone call from your bank's phone number, you can be assured that it is actually your bank calling you. Read More Why robocalls are about to get more dangerous The Federal Communications Commission wants all telecom companies to start using SHAKEN/STIR by the end of the year. AT&T and Comcast are among the first to adopt the technology for authenticated caller ID. While this represents an important first step, we will not realize the full potential of this technology until all carriers embrace it. That's because there can only be an authenticated caller ID if the calling carrier and receiving carrier both support SHAKEN/STIR. Efforts to increase the FCC's power to combat robocalls and encourage authenticated caller ID will also help. A good example of this is the TRACED Act , which would give the FCC more time to investigate robocalls. In addition, the bill would require all telecom companies to start using SHAKEN/STIR within 18 months of the bill's passing. The combined efforts will hopefully stem the robocall tide. Though these efforts are likely to reduce the number of robocalls bombarding our phones every day, it's unlikely they'll be a cure-all. We just don't know enough about the entire robocall ecosystem yet: where scammers collect the phone numbers, who the scammers are, where the calls are coming from, how scammers are making money, and who is falling victim to these scams. Without this basic roadmap, we cannot evaluate the effectiveness of our anti-robocall efforts. For instance, increasing legislative penalties might not be as effective if the bulk of scammers are operating outside US jurisdiction. Or, authenticated caller ID might not be as effective if victims are falling for scams without caller ID spoofing. More Tech & Innovation Perspectives 5G will have an enormous impact on the world

Samsung's foldable phone isn't about making money ‚Äî and that's the whole point
To help address these issues, there should be a concerted effort by public agencies such as the National Science Foundation to fund research into combating robocalls. With scientific study, we can better understand what makes for an effective phone scam and what causes victims to fall for them. We can look to the area of cybercrime in the mid to late 2000s to see the success of this strategy. Through funded projects, researchers were able to better understand many different areas of cybercrime: email spam, phishing, clickfraud, identify theft, botnets and many more. The public and private sectors were then able to work together to address the root causes of these types of cybercrime.
Botnets, a network of bots that can hack and steal your information, offer a great example. The academic research community, after a number of studies, developed a taxonomy of botnets in 2007 and took over a botnet in 2009 without disabling it. This knowledge of botnet functionality eventually allowed the FBI to take down the GameOver Zeus Botnet in 2014 by targeting the command-and-control infrastructure, which the FBI says was responsible for more than $100 million in damages. The same strategy should be encouraged in combating robocalls: We lack a detailed map of the players involved, so we cannot target a similar ""command-and-control"" infrastructure to take down robocalling operations. We must continue to pursue solutions to stop robocalls, and we must continue this momentum by funding research into this area so we can address the root causes and stop robocalls once and for all."
Interviewing for a new job? Here's the best time to bring up salary,edition.cnn.com,Kathryn Vasel,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/success/salary-job-interview/index.html,"(CNN) When interviewing for a job, you want to enthusiastically spout off your skills and the value you can bring to the company.

Handling a crisis is always hard. Here's how companies can do better
Are you ever too old to start investing?
""Wait as long as possible to talk about salary,"" said Josh Doody, author of ""Fearless Salary Negotiation."" If you throw out a number first, you risk limiting the offer that might be coming your way. As a candidate, you have no bargaining power. You haven't had the chance to show off your skills, ideas and how you would be an asset to the company. The further along you make it through the process without giving salary expectations, the more money you can likely command. Read More ""Everything you say in the interview process either helps or hurts you,"" said Katie Donovan, founder of Equal Pay Negotiations. ""You are most powerful after they are in love with you and after the job offer. You have just proved you are the best candidate, now is the time to try and get everything you can for the job, but not a moment before."" She even suggested that if a job application requires you to list a salary expectation, write zero. But avoiding the subject of salary isn't always easy. Recruiters and hiring managers are trained to get this information out of you. How to land a new job in 2019 If the question is asked early in the process, Donovan recommended saying that you don't know enough about the job yet. ""There is a lot of pressure [to give a number] and most people comply because they want to get to the interview process,"" said Doody. ""That can be a very expensive mistake."" He suggested redirecting by saying you aren't comfortable giving a figure and would rather focus on the value you will add and how you want this to be a big step forward for you in terms of responsibilities and compensation. There will be a lot of pressure [to give a number] and most people comply because they want to get to the interview process. But that can be a very expensive mistake.""
Josh Doody, salary negotiation coach
Because here's the thing: You are at a disadvantage when it comes to salary data. Yes, there are resources that can help you find out ranges for the position and location, but the company likely has a lot more data at its disposal to calculate compensation. ""There is no job opening that hasn't been budgeted,"" said Donovan. ""It isn't your job to explain to them what the job is budgeted."" If you really need to know about pay, Linda Babcock, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said you can ask about the pay range for the role. But be prepared for them to come back and ask for your number. ""You are obligated since you are the one who broached the question."" If you do provide a range early in the process, that shouldn't stop you from negotiating an offer later, according to Doody. ""You just negotiate normally and if they question it, you can say that 'I was just guessing before, but that was when I had not seen the full offer or the benefits package. Now that I've seen those things, I would like to negotiate.'"" Even if you're being recruited, try to avoid being the first one to ask about salary. ""When you say, 'how much does it pay?' it's like asking on a first date: 'How many children are we going to have?' That is how far down the line you have jumped,"" said Donovan. If you are worried that the compensation won't be in line with your expectations, look for clues in the job description, like title, years of experience, number of people being managed, or skill requirements that could hint at salary. How to handle an after-hours work request ""If they want to bring you all the way to an offer without saying anything about pay, let them,"" said Donovan. ""Don't be concerned about wasting your time. Losing a few hours to interviews is a lot better than working for four years being paid 5% less than you should have been."" Once you finally get an offer, keep in mind that is the starting point for negotiations. Take a few days to review the offer. ""Typically, it is good for a week,"" said Donovan. ""It is always good to clarify by saying when you plan to respond to the offer. They will tell you if that is too long."""

(CNN) It has been over 300 days since a Department of Defense spokesperson briefed the press on camera at the Pentagon. While this is unprecedented, it is not unusual for this administration.
Price Floyd There have been long gaps between on-camera press briefings at the White House and the Department of State as well. But the Department of Defense has traditionally had a different relationship with the media. The goal of the Defense Department's Public Affairs office has been to educate and inform the public. I realize that the line between inform/educate and influence has blurred, but the overall intent for years has been to keep the American people informed about the ongoing work of its military. Over the last several weeks, I have seen more online chatter about the lack of on-camera briefings among the media that covers the department. Most have commented on the inevitable breakdown in transparency and accountability we demand from our public servants, especially given the mission of the Defense Department. Although these are important points, what hasn't been discussed is what the act of briefing the press on-camera each and every day can do for the department, as well as for the White House. In holding a daily press briefing, a spokesperson decides how to respond to questions from the media and what information to provide. These are powerful tools, because it helps to prevent the public from speculating. Read More Pentagon awards nearly $1 billion to build Trump's border wall While informing and educating the American people and a foreign audience, the department is held accountable -- we are a democracy, after all. And it should want to be held accountable because that builds credibility, which in this administration seems in short supply. There seems to be a consensus among defense reporters that this absence of a daily press briefing is due to President Trump. No spokesperson wants to get ahead of the President or make news, when President Trump seems to want to be the only one to do so. But as I said, the Defense Department is supposed to be different. We should not only expect, but demand that the general public be kept informed through the give and take of a daily press briefing, in order to ensure that our military is indeed the greatest force for good many believe it is. I can understand the wish not to have to answer seemingly endless questions from reporters on topics you would rather just ignore, but our system demands that we hold our leaders accountable. If spokespersons are seen taking any and all questions from the press and have their answers verified by diligent reporting, then the information they provide is more likely to be seen as truthful.

This administration's policy of not providing access to senior officials in an open and on-camera press briefing makes their job that much more difficult. This doesn't mean reporters aren't able to contact senior officials for interviews or that the media is without its sources for information, but that is not the same thing as an on-camera briefing -- and both the media and administration officials know that. I have sat in innumerable press briefings over the years and can say with conviction that the more often they happen and the longer the spokesperson stays at the podium, the better it is for the administration -- whether it is a Republican or a Democratic one. The best spokespersons stay at the podium and ask several times: ""Any more questions? Any topic I didn't cover? Nothing? You sure? You can ask me anything. I'm here. Nothing? OK, then until tomorrow. Have a good day."" The podium is powerful, but only if you use it and use it wisely."

The paper said the agency ""would be pulled apart and its functions divided among three other departments."" Citing conversations with unnamed administration officials, the Post reported that an executive order ""directing parts of the transition by the fall is in the final stages of review"" and that President Donald Trump will ""likely"" make an announcement on the plan in the coming months. According to the paper, the agency's 5,565 employees were briefed on the plan in March. The Post said the White House ""is short on details"" of the plan, but noted that it plans to break apart the agency ""in several stages, with some steps beginning now and other changes delayed pending congressional approval."" It also said officials ""were not able to estimate the short- or long-term savings"" of the agency's closure. According to the paper, OPM's annual budget is $2.1 billion. Judd Deere, a spokesman for the White House, told CNN Wednesday that Trump ""is committed to reforming the federal government, making it more efficient, effective, and accountable for hardworking American taxpayers."" Read More The paper said two of the agency's ""core functions, the employee retirement and health-care systems,"" would be transferred to another agency, which would require congressional approval. The White House is working to ""parcel out"" other agency responsibilities by the fall, the paper said, with the agency's background investigation operation being put under the Defense Department's purview and the General Services Administration taking over OPM's ""human resources role, including training, pay and hiring, workforce planning, and the inspector general's office."" According to the Post, the White House is asking Congress for $50 million in fiscal year 2020 to execute the plan and OPM does not ""intend to lay anyone off but instead will shrink the workforce through retirements and unfilled vacancies."" Margaret Weichert, OPM's acting director and OMB's deputy director, told the paper that the dismantling of the agency is ""a big, exemplary step,"" and that the agency, which was formed in 1978, was ""fundamentally not set up for success, structurally."" CNN has reached out to Weichert's office for comment. In a letter sent to Weichert last month and provided to CNN by Rep.

Joe Biden controversy doesn't hurt his standing with California voters - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Maeve Reston,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/joe-biden-california-voters-poll/index.html,"(CNN) WARNING: This story contains graphic language.
The question of whether allegations of unwanted touching against former Vice President Joe Biden would hurt his standing with voters should he mount a 2020 presidential campaign got its first answer this week. And it appears, for now, to be no. A new Quinnipiac poll of Democrats in California, where voting will take place on the March 3 Super Tuesday primary next year, shows Biden in the lead and finds that 71% of Democrats polled said Biden's touching of several women in a way that made them uncomfortable was not a serious issue. In interviews with nearly two dozen voters over the last week, Biden's touchy-feely behavior drew a collective shrug, even if many women viewed his jokes as being in ""poor taste,"" as one voter put it to CNN. Biden said in response to the complaints that he will be more mindful and respectful of physical space in the future. But he stirred controversy late last week when he joked about his fresh understanding of personal space invasions, assuring an audience at a union conference that he had permission to hug a male labor leader or, later, wrap his arm around a kid that the potential 2020 contender had invited on stage. Read More Biden jokes about physical contact in first speech since allegations he made women uncomfortable Some female voters recoiled, questioning whether Biden was making light of the discomfort experienced by women on the receiving end of his close-talk, shoulder grabs, nose rubs and occasional kisses on the top of the head. Others wondered whether he'd lost his political antennae, given the sensitivities of the current debate. But many other female Democrats -- including here in California, where the early #MeToo movement took hold -- view the controversy over Biden's history as a ""tactile politician"" as completely overblown. ""I'm a big supporter of the #MeToo movement, but I feel like we're shifting the goal post, and no one asked us if we were going to shift the goal post to just what makes us uncomfortable,"" said Seta Ghazarian, a 41-year old teacher of Victorville, who is leaning toward Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but keeping South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and California Sen. Kamala Harris in her top tier of choices. Ghazarian and her friend Holly Purser, a fellow high school teacher from Apple Valley, described the uncomfortable touching accusations against Biden thus far as ""pretty trivial."" As they waited for Castro, another 2020 contender, to speak at a Saturday rally in East Los Angeles, they pointed out that the #MeToo movement was meant to call out serious infractions like assault and sexual harassment. ""It's a kiss on the head, or the cheek, or a shoulder -- that daddy, kind-of-grandpa move. It's not like you're 'grabbing pussy,'"" said Purser, referencing President Donald Trump's infamous boast that he could grab women wherever he wanted while speaking with television host Billy Bush; the exchange was captured on a 2005 Access Hollywood tape that surfaced just before the 2016 election. For many female voters here, the pressure on Biden to keep apologizing for his personal space invasions, or to even stand down in the 2020 presidential race, are instances in which the #MeToo pendulum has swung too far. (Former congressional aide Amy Lappos, an accuser who said Biden grabbed her by the head and rubbed noses with her at a 2009 fundraiser, said the former vice president should ""step aside and support one of the many talented and qualified women running."") Brenda Valle-Balderrama, a 34-year-old attorney and unaffiliated voter from Los Angeles, said she was ""bothered"" earlier this month when Lucy Flores, a former Nevada assemblywoman, wrote an essay saying she felt ""uneasy, gross and confused"" when Biden came up behind her and kissed her on the top of the head during a 2014 campaign event while she was running for lieutenant governor of Nevada. But Valle-Balderrama said she felt that Biden took ""ownership of his actions"" in his video message about the allegations stating that he ""heard what these women are saying"" and that he would be more mindful of respecting personal space. While she is most interested in Castro and former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke at the moment, she described Biden as a very likeable person who is experienced and has done good work for the country. ""I think the goal here is for men to understand that things are changing,"" Valle-Balderrama said. ""Before, we weren't having this conversation, and so that's why it was, quote, unquote, 'OK,' to do these things,"" she said, referring to Biden's hugs and tactile behavior. ""But now people are taking it seriously."" She added that Biden's jokes, made after the allegations surfaced, were ""maybe in poor taste given the warm water that he's in right now."" ""I don't particularly take offense to it; I don't think it's a big deal,"" she said. ""But it's kind of like, 'Come on, you're just getting yourself out of this situation? Just let things cool.'"" Biden says he expects more women may come forward to say his touches have made them uncomfortable. But many female voters here say they believe him when he says he's never been ""disrespectful, intentionally"" -- and feel far greater outrage when they think about the hypocrisy of Trump trying to frame Biden as ""creepy,"" given the far more serious allegations of unwanted kissing or touching against the President from an array of women. (Trump has denied all the allegations against him). ""I just don't see Biden being a creep like that,"" said Azucena Carrillo, 34-year-old realtor from Boyle Heights who describes herself as a strong supporter of Biden. ""If anything, he's probably very affectionate. He's sort of (a) fatherly type. But women right now, we're super sensitive to everything, so I get it. I would be more wary if I was Biden. But I would never think that he would be a creep like Trump."" ""He comes from the same foundation that (Barack) Obama did, he has the same beliefs,"" Carrillo said, explaining why she would support his candidacy if he announces that he's running, as he is expected to do after Easter. ""He has a humble demeanor, and I think he's here for the people and would run a 'for the people' campaign versus Trump."" In these conversations with women voters about Biden, some women who remember Biden's oversight of the 1991 Anita Hill hearings cite his role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee as the bigger hurdle for him to clear as he runs for president in a party where the agenda is increasingly being driven by empowered women. Hill accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, and then was interrogated by a panel of all-male senators. Hill, now a professor at Brandeis, told The Boston Globe that Biden owed the country an apology. At event in New York in late March, Biden noted that he'd publicly apologized to Hill and wished he'd done more to give Hill, the ""hearing she deserved."" Though Biden voted against confirming Thomas to the Supreme Court, Nanette Carey, a 53-year-old paralegal who favors Warren, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Castro, said the fact that Thomas is on the Supreme Court is a permanent stain on Biden's record. ""A lot of people in my age group remember coming home from work and watching the Anita Hill hearings,"" Carey said. ""Yes, it's old, but we still have Clarence Thomas to look at every day. What (Biden) did was long term. He was on that all-male panel -- I mean, I remember it -- I found my steno pad where I had notes. I was really into it. So I think a lot of that past is going to come up."" Carey, however, said she believed Biden could overcome the most recent accusations of inappropriate touching against him. ""Not to minimize Lucy Flores and the other ladies' reaction to what happened, but there are levels,"" Carey said. ""Since it happened to (Flores) in 2014, that was recent enough for her to speak up. But like in the '80s, '70s, women were told, 'Oh, men will be men' -- we were told that B.S. And now women are like, 'No, we're not putting up with it anymore.'"" ""I'm not a touchy person, so I probably would have shrugged and said, 'What are you doing?'"" Carey said, referring to the Biden-Flores incident. ""He seems like the type who would say, 'Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize.' ... I think all of it (the touching) shouldn't be done. Men should learn to keep their hands to themselves. It needs to stop.... But that would not be disqualifying from me voting for him."""
"Consumer Product Safety Commission,, for second time in months, sides with makers of unsafe baby products - CNN",edition.cnn.com,"Ray Sanchez and Melissa Alonso, CNN",04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/health/consumer-safety-product-commission-recalls/index.html,"(CNN) The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission, for the second time in recent months, has sided with manufacturers of baby products that have caused death or injury to infants.
The American Academy of Pediatrics on Tuesday called for the immediate recall of the Fisher-Price Rock 'n Play Sleeper, citing a Consumer Reports analysis linking the popular sleeper to 32 infant deaths. The demand comes just months after the federal agency tasked with protecting consumers from hazardous toys and products allowed another manufacturer, Britax, to resolve reports of injuries involving its popular BOB Gear jogging strollers without issuing a recall. In the case of the baby sleeper, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and Fisher-Price on Friday issued an alert asking customers to stop using the popular product if their children can roll over. It cited reports of 10 infant deaths since 2015. Fisher-Price also has said it does not believe its baby sleeper caused all the deaths reported by Consumer Reports, claiming some of the children either had a previous medical condition or the product was not used properly, the journal reported. Read More But the pediatricians' group said the CPSC warning did not go far enough and called for stores to remove the sleeper from its shelves. 'Consumers will come up short,' officials warned The CPSC in November settled with Britax over how to inform consumers about strollers involved in at least 50 injuries to children and 47 adults. That deal also stopped short of a recall. Two CPSC commissioners, however, issued a dissenting opinion to the administrative court settlement between the agency and the manufacturer, writing that ""consumers will come up short in terms of safety"" under the agreement. ""We fear that other respondents will invoke this agreement as a precedent in future recalls, thereby lessening safety for far more consumers than are affected by this agreement,"" Commissioners Robert Adler and Elliot Kaye wrote. The settlement followed a CPSC administrative complaint against Britax Child Safety, maker of the BOB Gear off-road strollers. The agency sought a recall, alleging that a quick release mechanism on the strollers failed to secure the front wheel to the fork. The defect represented a substantial hazard leading to serious injuries, the CPSC said. The company fought against the recall, maintaining its product was not defective. The BOB stroller has a quick-release feature that, when used properly, ""is safe and doesn't require a recall,"" Britax President Robert McCutcheon said in a statement. ""It allows you to quickly remove the front wheel, making it easy to fold up for storage or transport,"" the statement said. ""But, some stroller users were unfamiliar with, or had trouble with, this feature, leading to some reports of injuries."" He said the company was also updating an educational campaign website on use of the strollers. Injuries to children on the BOB Gear off-road strollers included a concussion, head and face trauma requiring stitches, dental injuries, contusions and abrasions; adults suffered a torn labrum, fractured bones, torn ligaments, contusions and abrasions. Adler and Kaye, two Democrats on the five-member CPSC, called the agreement ""misleading"" for failing to characterize the manufacturer's corrective action plan as a recall. The dissenting commissioners wrote that the manufacturer agreed to inform dealers and retailers that Britax ""resolved this litigation without a recall developing and launching an information campaign to further instruct consumers how to safely and correctly operate the Quick Release on the BOB strollers manufactured prior to September 2015."" ""It's not quite analogous to a tree falling in a forest with no one to hear it, but it's close,"" Adler and Kaye wrote. ""Having an agreement that provides relief without anyone being fully alerted to the nature of the relief is pretty much no relief at all."" In announcing the settlement, The CPSC said Britax will "" develop and launch an information campaign that will include an instructional video demonstrating how to safely and correctly operate the quick release on the front wheel of the strollers."" The agreement ""does not constitute an admission by Britax, or a determination by the Commission, that BOB jogging strollers contain a defect or are a substantial product hazard,"" according to the CPSC. The company also agreed to offer replacement parts or discounts on new strollers to users who requested them. The commission approved the Britax settlement to avoid ""a prolonged, protracted, and uncertain lawsuit,"" acting CPSC Chairwoman Ann Marie Buerkle said in a statement. ""The Britax settlement advances consumer safety,"" she said. ""I urge those who own the strollers to take part in Britax's education and information campaign."" Nonprofit says CPSC recalls dropped 44% in 2018 ""They got away without calling it a recall,"" Nancy Cowles, executive director of the nonprofit Kids in Danger , said of Britax. ""If a product is not recalled, there is nothing to stop selling those or new parents from buying."" Cowles noted that the number of recalls involving products for children in 2018 -- 52 -- represented a 44% drop from the 93 recalls in 2017. That's the lowest in at least 10 years, she said. ""We do think that this is a trend,"" she said. ""Part of the problem now is innate in that the manufacturer has a lot of power. There is a lot of pushback by manufacturers."" A Kids in Danger report released last month said that ""the product safety system has a long way to go to ensure the safety of our most vulnerable consumers -- children."" Less than five months after the Britax settlement, the CPSC determination on the Fisher-Price Rock 'n Play Sleeper has come under scrutiny. ""This product is deadly and should be recalled immediately,"" said Dr. Kyle Yasuda, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. ""When parents purchase a product for their baby or child, many assume that if it's being sold in a store, it must be safe to use. Tragically, that is not the case. There is convincing evidence that the Rock 'n Play inclined sleeper puts infants' lives at risk, and CPSC must step up and take immediate action to remove it from stores and prevent further tragedies."" Chuck Scothon, general manager at Fisher-Price, said in a statement that the sleeper meets all ""applicable safety standards"" and that the ""safety of children is our highest priority. The loss of a child is tragic and heart-breaking."" Scothon said the company stands by the safety of the sleeper and continued to work with the commission on the safe use of its products. ""It is essential that the product warnings and instructions are always followed,"" the statement said. ""We will continue to do all we can to ensure that parents and caregivers have the information necessary to create a safe sleep environment for infants."" CPSC is investigating Rock 'n Play deaths, it says The pediatricians' group noted that Consumer Reports concluded that 32 deaths, between 2011 and 2018, included babies younger than the 3-month threshold in the initial warning. The cause of death for some babies was asphyxia, or the inability to breathe, caused by the babies' position. ""We cannot put any more children's lives at risk by keeping these dangerous products on the shelves,"" said Dr. Rachel Moon, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Task Force on sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS. This grieving family wants Fisher-Price's Rock 'n Play sleeper recalled and pediatrics group agrees The pediatricians' group does not recommend inclined sleep products such as Rock 'n Play, or any other products that require restraining a baby. It also advises against using car seats, strollers or other devices for sleep. The group said babies could roll or turn into an unsafe position and suffer suffocation or strangulation when unable to move. The CPSC said last week that the 10 reported fatalities -- of babies 3 months or older -- involved infants who rolled from their back to their stomach or side while unrestrained. The warning did not say what caused the infants' deaths. The latest death was reported last month, said Patty Davis, a spokeswoman with the CPSC. It's unclear when the other deaths took place. The CPSC recommended the public stop using the sleeper if their children are 3 months old or ""as soon as an infant exhibits rollover capabilities."" The commission is aware of the report of additional fatalities, Davis said. ""We are investigating other deaths that have occurred in the Rock 'n Play,"" she said in a statement. ""CPSC has requirements it must follow for any decisions concerning recalls. If the evidence shows the need for a recall, we will take that step. We continue to work on this very important safety issue."""

The vote was 92-7. Khashoggi's son denies settlement reached over father's murder Abizaid, the former head of US Central Command, was nominated to the post by President Donald Trump in November 2018. His confirmation will fill one key vacancy in the region -- the US Embassy has been without an ambassador since Joseph Westphal left in early January 2017. Abizaid heads to Riyadh during a time of fraught diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. US lawmakers continue to push for accountability for Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist whose murder was believed to be orchestrated by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Senators pressed Abizaid on Khashoggi's killing and Saudi Arabia's other human rights abuses, including lashings, electrocutions, beatings, whippings, sexual abuse, raids, the alleged detention and torture of activists and royal family members, during his nomination hearing in early March.

On Monday, the State Department publicly designated 16 people for the roles they played in Khashoggi's murder, rendering them and their immediate families ""ineligible for entry into the United States."" The Crown Prince was not on that list. Just last week, the Kingdom arrested two US citizens in a crackdown of dissidents -- a move that comes following the detention and reported torture of another US citizen, Dr. Walid Fitaihi."
2020 fundraising: Bernie Sanders still dominates with $18.2 million - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Fredreka Schouten,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/2020-fundraising-numbers-quarter-1/index.html,"WASHINGTON (CNN) Bernie Sanders, a one-time political insurgent, has cemented his role as the fundraising frontrunner of the 2020 Democratic field -- as many of his rivals report pulling in just a fraction of the $18.2 million the Vermont senator collected during the first 41 days of his presidential campaign.
Despite Sanders' early role as the party's fundraising leader, no candidate is setting fundraising records as a crowded field of nearly 20 Democrats jockeys for attention from voters and donors. In the 2008 campaign, when Democrats and Republicans fielded multiple candidates in the wide-open race to succeed George W.

In the 2020 race for the Democratic nomination, no one comes close to the fundraising prowess of either Clinton or Obama.

Bill Barr: Who was 'spying' on the Trump campaign? And why? - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/william-barr-spying-carter-page/index.html,"(CNN) On Wednesday, Attorney General William Barr told lawmakers that ""spying did occur"" on President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, adding: ""I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal.""
Which, if true, it is! Here's the problem: Barr provided little context or evidence for the ""spying"" charge. Which is kind of troubling given that he is the top law enforcement official in the country. Later, he added, ""I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred. I am saying that I am concerned about it and I'm looking into it."" THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!
In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!
But never mind that right now... Since Barr provided almost no explanation for ""spying"" allegation, let's try to figure out what he's talking about. Read More The best guess I can come up with begins with a man named Carter Page. Page, for a time in the Trump campaign, served as a foreign policy adviser to the presidential candidate. Page stepped away from the campaign in September 2016, after articles highlighted his Russian ties. In October 2016, the FBI applied for a warrant to surveil Page under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The warrant was approved. And subsequently renewed three times. Based on that very simple summation, you could conclude, I suppose, that ""spying did occur"" on a member of Trump's presidential campaign. But a fuller picture raises questions about that sort of over-simplification. According to the FISA warrant for Page , a redacted version of which was released in July 2018, the FBI had been keeping an eye on Page for several years -- dating back to at least 2013, when it learned that Russians were trying to recruit American operatives and that Page might be a target. The application also included information from the opposition research document put together by former British spy Christopher Steele, alleging that on a trip to Russia in July 2016, Page met with two Russian officials to discuss lifting US sanctions against the country. (Page denies the meeting.) ""The FBI believes that Page has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government,"" the application stated, adding that ""there is probable cause that such activities involve or are about to involve violations of the criminal statutes of the United States."" Then there is the matter of how one gets a FISA warrant. In short, it's not easy. There are 11 judges -- all appointed by the Supreme Court chief justice -- who sit on something called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and decide whether or not law enforcement has shown enough evidence to justify the very serious matter of spying on an American citizen. (All of the FISC judges are federal judges, with their own separate docket of cases.) This group hears applications pertinent to FISA. As April Doss, the one-time senior minority counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation who is now chair of cyber & privacy at the law firm Saul Ewing, told me in 2018 : ""All FISA applications go through a lengthy process of approvals within the executive branch as well as in front of the FISC. The details of the process vary according to which section of the FISA legislation is being used to support the application. But the key points for any Title I FISA application are that they go through lengthy internal vetting at the originating agency -- in this case at the FBI. That vetting includes a lot of career FBI agents and lawyers and a supervisory special agent before it gets to the level of the FBI director or deputy director for approval. The same thing happens at the Department of Justice, where working-level career attorneys in the National Security Division review the application before it goes to the head of NSD for approval and then to the attorney general or deputy attorney general."" In short: It's neither an easy nor a partisan process. Nor is it an illegal one. Spying on an American citizen isn't something that law enforcement is allowed to do willy-nilly but it is something they are allowed to do if the FISC judge decides they have offered sufficient evidence to prove their need to do so. The fact that Page's FISA warrant was not only approved but re-authorized three times suggests that a FISC judge found plenty of evidence to suggest the warrant was necessary. And if you read what Barr said closely, he acknowledges that reality. ""I think spying did occur,"" Barr said before adding: ""The question is whether it was ... adequately predicated."" That is, in fact, the question. There's one other thing we have to throw into the mix here: Trump's own thoughts about reports of surveillance. In a trio of tweets on March 4, 2017, Trump said this: 1. ""Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! "" 2. ""I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!"" 3. ""How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!"" It seems as though he is talking about the Page FISA warrant. (The timing of the warrant's approval lines up with Trump's claim.) In addition to the Page FISAs, Trump and his allies have cried foul that the FBI used confidential sources or informants to contact Trump campaign associates in 2016 and ask about their Russian ties. But what Trump is claiming here simply doesn't match up with what we know about the FISA process. The President -- Obama or anyone else -- doesn't issue or approve FISA warrants. The FISA warrant for Page wasn't targeted at Trump's phones in Trump Tower. None of this was focused on the FBI swaying an election against Trump; it was centered on the concern that someone who had worked for the presidential candidate might have been compromised by the Russians. I suspect -- emphasis on the word ""suspect"" -- that Barr knows all of this. But he also knows that by using the word ""spying"" he is signaling some sort of seemingly nefarious behavior as opposed to the legal and rigorous processes in place that allow law enforcement to surveil an American citizen. Let's wait and see what this investigation Barr is conducting into the roots of Page's surveillance turns up. (The Justice Department's internal watchdog is also reviewing this and his report is expected this spring, Barr said.) But if past is prologue, the investigation will show that federal law enforcement officials acted entirely within their legal boundaries."
Nobody on Wall Street seems afraid. Here's why that's scary - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Paul R. La Monica,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/investing/stock-market-fear/index.html," Many value investors swear by the saying that the best time to be buying stocks is when there's blood in the streets. You can get rich by taking advantage of other investors' fears. But what do you do when absolutely nobody is afraid?
The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq are all sporting double-digit percentage gains in 2019, and are inching closer to the record highs they set last year. Only 34 stocks in the S&P 500 were down for the year as of Monday's close. The VIX ( VIX ) , a measure of volatility often referred to as Wall Street's fear gauge, has plummeted nearly 50% this year as anxiety has ebbed about an imminent recession and the Federal Reserve raising rates too aggressively. The CNN Business Fear & Greed Index , which looks at the VIX and six other indicators of market sentiment, isn't far from Extreme Greed levels. Welcome to the FOMO market Read More This investor giddiness is starting to make some people worried. The market often suffers from bouts of euphoria right before things turn south. People simply get too complacent. Analysts at Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Global Investment Committee wrote in a report Monday that investors appear to be suffering from a different type of fear these days ‚Äî the fear of missing out. The hope, according to Morgan Stanley, is that ""a Fed-engineered soft landing and lower real interest rates"" will justify current market valuations. The bull market turns 10 years old But John Norris, managing director with Oakworth Capital, told CNN Business that he's preparing his clients for more volatility ahead. ""We're telling people that this feels nice, but enjoy it while it lasts. We could have periods this year that could be gut-wrenching,"" Norris said. ""Expectations for earnings and the economy don't justify this rally."" Profits are expected to fall in the first quarter and expectations are for weak GDP growth too. Trade tensions haven't gone away either. The biggest risk on the horizon is if the United States imposes tariffs on Europe, said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management, following the news that President Trump is threatening tariffs following a dispute over the EU allegedly providing subsidies to Boeing rival Airbus . But the good news for long-term investors who are planning for retirement is that any pullback in stocks isn't likely to be severe. Norris said stocks may still finish the year where they ended the first quarter. In other words, the market may meander a bit and fall slightly from current levels. But it's not going to plunge like a rock. ""We don't see a 2008 type event where there is a permanent erosion of capital,"" Norris said. ""There's no need to lose sleep over the stock market."" No need to freak out -- but it may be time to exercise caution Others agree that now is not a time for panic, but prudent and more cautious approach to the market seems justified. ""Volatility is still pretty low but financial conditions suggest you need to tighten your seat belts and stay put,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Cresset Capital. ""There is a temptation to take money off the table and sit tight for the rest of the year."" JUST WATCHED Jeremy Siegel: Trade war is biggest risk to stocks Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

But some longer-term investors are growing more worried. Commonfund, an asset manager that works with nonprofit institutions, recently surveyed investors from endowments, foundations and public pensions and found that many of them think the days are numbered for the current bull market. ""Investors have grown more skeptical about the longevity of this strong economy,"" said Mark Anson, CEO and chief investment officer of Commonfund in a statement. Nearly half of those surveyed think the market rally will end within the next year and almost a third think it will go for only another two years. And approximately 60% of those surveyed said they think global stock markets will underperform their historical average returns this year."
Democrats furious over William Barr's 'spying' comments,edition.cnn.com,Jeremy Herb,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/democrats-reaction-spying/index.html,"(CNN) Congressional Democrats are furious over Attorney General William Barr's statement Wednesday that Donald Trump's campaign was spied on, accusing the attorney general of mischaracterizing the FBI's counterintelligence investigation in an effort to please President Donald Trump .
Barr's comments are likely to ratchet up Democrats' unease over the attorney general that's already simmering over Barr's role in the Mueller investigation and the decision there wasn't sufficient evidence to prosecute obstruction of justice. ""I'm amazed that the AG would make that kind of statement, I think it's in many ways disrespectful to the men and women who work in the DOJ, and it shows, I think, either a lack of understanding or willful ignorance on what goes into a counterintelligence investigation,"" Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN. ""He almost seems to be endorsing one of these theories that has been debunked time and time again by the various, even House Republican-led, investigations trying to show some kind of resentment,"" Warner added. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said of Barr's testimony that he was ""going off the rails."" Read More ""He is the Attorney General of the United States, not the attorney general of Donald Trump,"" she said. But Republicans who have already been investigating the origins of the FBI's investigation into Trump's team and Russia praised Barr's comments, saying they welcomed his plans to review the matter. ""I say God bless him,"" said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee. ""I've been very impressed with the attorney general. He said (Tuesday) in the hearing in front of the appropriations subcommittee that he's going to go back to the beginning, back to the summer of 2016 and examine what took place. I think that's exactly what needs to happen."" Trump said Wednesday that Barr was doing a ""great job"" and ""getting started on going back to the origins on where exactly this all started because it was an illegal witch hunt."" 'Spying did occur, yes' At a Senate subcommittee hearing Wednesday, Barr explained that he would review the beginning of the counterintelligence investigation because ""I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal."" Barr: Mueller did not ask for conclusion on obstruction of justice Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, asked whether he was suggesting there was spying, and Barr responded: ""Spying did occur, yes. I think spying did occur."" Later, Barr was asked twice whether he wanted to clarify his statement. Barr first said he wanted to make sure no ""unauthorized surveillance"" occurred, and then offered up his own clarification at the conclusion of the hearing. ""I just want to make it clear, thinking back on all the different colloquies here, that I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred,"" Barr said. ""I'm saying that I am concerned about it and looking into it, that's all."" When Barr spoke of ""spying,"" according to a source familiar with his thinking, he meant it in the ""classic sense"" of intelligence collection. The source said Barr doesn't view the term as ""pejorative"" and is focused on where there was proper ""predication"" for any surveillance. The source said Barr did not use the term ""spying"" in order to throw red meat to Trump and those who have voiced concerns over surveillance tactics. But that did little to satisfy Democrats who are already threatening to subpoena the Justice Department if Barr will not provide them the full, unredacted Mueller report and underlying evidence. ""These comments directly contradict what DOJ previously told us,"" tweeted House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, who authorized the subpoena for the Mueller report. ""I've asked DOJ to brief us immediately."" ""The top law enforcement officer of the country should not casually suggest that those under his purview engaged in 'spying' on a political campaign,"" said House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat. ""This type of partisan talking point may please Donald Trump, who rails against a 'deep state coup,' but it also strikes another destructive blow to our democratic institutions. Since Barr released his summary of Mueller's principal conclusions, Republicans have gone on offense attacking Democrats for repeatedly claiming that Mueller would find collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Several Democrats have said they can't trust Barr to accurately convey Mueller's report, given that he's a Trump political appointee, and want to wait to read Mueller's full documents before they come to a judgment on the question of collusion. ""I'm not going to comment on what the Mueller conclusions are until I look at them,"" Warner said. ""I spent two years trying to defend the Mueller investigation, I should get the chance to review that report before I make any comments on those conclusions."" Questions over spying Barr's comments are not the first time questions about FBI spying on the Trump campaign have been raised. Republicans have accused the FBI of abusing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in obtaining a FISA warrant on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page , accusing the FBI and Justice Department of hiding the political leanings of the opposition research dossier that was included in the warrant. Former FBI Director James Comey confirmed in closed-door congressional testimony last year that the FBI opened its counterintelligence investigation in 2016 into four individuals who worked on the Trump campaign, but not the Trump campaign itself. Trump and congressional Republicans also accused the FBI of spying on the Trump campaign over the use of confidential intelligence sources in 2016, amid an effort from then-Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes for Congress to access classified documents on the matter. But one of the key Republicans reviewing the matter, former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, said at the time that the FBI ""did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got."" Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz is currently reviewing the FBI and Justice Department's actions during the Russia investigation. Barr said Tuesday that Horowitz's investigation is likely to be completed in May or June. The issue is also something that Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham has vowed to investigate, picking up on the Republican-led investigations in the House from the last Congress. On Wednesday, Graham, a South Carolina Republican, asked Barr why the Justice Department never briefed the Trump campaign that it ""may be targeted by a foreign entity?"" ""That is one of the questions I have, is, I feel normally, the campaign would have been advised of this,"" Barr said. ""I am interested in getting that answered. They had two former US attorneys in Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani involved in the campaign, and I don't understand why the campaign was not advised."" CNN and others have reported that senior US intelligence officials told Trump in August 2016 that foreign adversaries -- including Russia -- would likely attempt to infiltrate his team or gather intelligence about his campaign. Asked afterward about Barr's comments, Graham aligned himself with Barr's comments on the need to investigate whether the Trump campaign was spied on. ""Somebody needs to look at it, and I hope we will,"" Graham said. This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday."

Passengers boarding Alaska Airlines' red-eye flight 1138 in San Francisco were in for quite a surprise. Over halfway through the flight, they had to divert to Chicago. One of their fellow passengers tried to break one of the cardinal rules of modern air travel: do not smoke on airplanes. Then the passenger refused to comply with flight crew instructions by trying to light up a cigarette -- again. A United Airlines flight was diverted after a strong odor left passengers feeling ill About an hour before they were supposed to land in Philadelphia, pilots were forced to divert to O'Hare International Airport. ""Due to a disruptive passenger onboard and out of an abundance of caution, the flight was diverted to Chicago and landed at 4:22 a.m. local time,"" Alaska Airlines told CNN. Read More Chicago Police say they were asked to meet the plane because of the cigarette-lighting passenger, who ""was somewhat belligerent."" While the individual was escorted off the plane without incident, the diversion added an hour onto the other passengers' red-eye flight, since the plane needed refueling. Airport odyssey reveals passengers both rude and funny It's unclear if the passenger will face any punishment for their actions. The FAA, which enforces the regulations the passenger violated, told CNN the incident is under investigation. Chicago Police say they did not make an arrest. The FBI and US Marshals tell CNN they did not make any arrest either. According to the agency's own recommendations, a flight attendant or pilot in charge should be filing a noncompliance report. CNN has asked Alaska Airlines if the crew from the flight has filed a report but has not yet received a response."
Bill Barr: Who was 'spying' on the Trump campaign? And why? - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/william-barr-spying-carter-page/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_allpolitics+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Politics%29,"(CNN) On Wednesday, Attorney General William Barr told lawmakers that ""spying did occur"" on President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, adding: ""I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal.""
Which, if true, it is! Here's the problem: Barr provided little context or evidence for the ""spying"" charge. Which is kind of troubling given that he is the top law enforcement official in the country. Later, he added, ""I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred. I am saying that I am concerned about it and I'm looking into it."" THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!

But never mind that right now... Since Barr provided almost no explanation for ""spying"" allegation, let's try to figure out what he's talking about. Read More The best guess I can come up with begins with a man named Carter Page. Page, for a time in the Trump campaign, served as a foreign policy adviser to the presidential candidate. Page stepped away from the campaign in September 2016, after articles highlighted his Russian ties. In October 2016, the FBI applied for a warrant to surveil Page under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The warrant was approved. And subsequently renewed three times. Based on that very simple summation, you could conclude, I suppose, that ""spying did occur"" on a member of Trump's presidential campaign. But a fuller picture raises questions about that sort of over-simplification. According to the FISA warrant for Page , a redacted version of which was released in July 2018, the FBI had been keeping an eye on Page for several years -- dating back to at least 2013, when it learned that Russians were trying to recruit American operatives and that Page might be a target. The application also included information from the opposition research document put together by former British spy Christopher Steele, alleging that on a trip to Russia in July 2016, Page met with two Russian officials to discuss lifting US sanctions against the country. (Page denies the meeting.) ""The FBI believes that Page has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government,"" the application stated, adding that ""there is probable cause that such activities involve or are about to involve violations of the criminal statutes of the United States."" Then there is the matter of how one gets a FISA warrant. In short, it's not easy. There are 11 judges -- all appointed by the Supreme Court chief justice -- who sit on something called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and decide whether or not law enforcement has shown enough evidence to justify the very serious matter of spying on an American citizen. (All of the FISC judges are federal judges, with their own separate docket of cases.) This group hears applications pertinent to FISA. As April Doss, the one-time senior minority counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation who is now chair of cyber & privacy at the law firm Saul Ewing, told me in 2018 : ""All FISA applications go through a lengthy process of approvals within the executive branch as well as in front of the FISC. The details of the process vary according to which section of the FISA legislation is being used to support the application. But the key points for any Title I FISA application are that they go through lengthy internal vetting at the originating agency -- in this case at the FBI. That vetting includes a lot of career FBI agents and lawyers and a supervisory special agent before it gets to the level of the FBI director or deputy director for approval. The same thing happens at the Department of Justice, where working-level career attorneys in the National Security Division review the application before it goes to the head of NSD for approval and then to the attorney general or deputy attorney general."" In short: It's neither an easy nor a partisan process. Nor is it an illegal one. Spying on an American citizen isn't something that law enforcement is allowed to do willy-nilly but it is something they are allowed to do if the FISC judge decides they have offered sufficient evidence to prove their need to do so. The fact that Page's FISA warrant was not only approved but re-authorized three times suggests that a FISC judge found plenty of evidence to suggest the warrant was necessary. And if you read what Barr said closely, he acknowledges that reality. ""I think spying did occur,"" Barr said before adding: ""The question is whether it was ... adequately predicated."" That is, in fact, the question. There's one other thing we have to throw into the mix here: Trump's own thoughts about reports of surveillance. In a trio of tweets on March 4, 2017, Trump said this: 1. ""Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! "" 2. ""I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!"" 3. ""How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!"" It seems as though he is talking about the Page FISA warrant. (The timing of the warrant's approval lines up with Trump's claim.) In addition to the Page FISAs, Trump and his allies have cried foul that the FBI used confidential sources or informants to contact Trump campaign associates in 2016 and ask about their Russian ties. But what Trump is claiming here simply doesn't match up with what we know about the FISA process. The President -- Obama or anyone else -- doesn't issue or approve FISA warrants. The FISA warrant for Page wasn't targeted at Trump's phones in Trump Tower. None of this was focused on the FBI swaying an election against Trump; it was centered on the concern that someone who had worked for the presidential candidate might have been compromised by the Russians. I suspect -- emphasis on the word ""suspect"" -- that Barr knows all of this. But he also knows that by using the word ""spying"" he is signaling some sort of seemingly nefarious behavior as opposed to the legal and rigorous processes in place that allow law enforcement to surveil an American citizen. Let's wait and see what this investigation Barr is conducting into the roots of Page's surveillance turns up. (The Justice Department's internal watchdog is also reviewing this and his report is expected this spring, Barr said.) But if past is prologue, the investigation will show that federal law enforcement officials acted entirely within their legal boundaries. "
"The number of global executions is down, says Amnesty International - CNN",edition.cnn.com,AJ Willingham,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/world/death-penalty-amnesty-international-numbers-2018-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The number of executions carried out across the world have reached a 10-year low, according to a new report from human rights organization Amnesty International .
At least 690 executions were carried out in 20 countries in 2018, which was a 31% decrease from 2017's total of 993 executions or more. The report is a moment of cautious optimism for human rights advocates who believe the death penalty to be a cruel and inhumane practice. However, along with the general decrease of executions, there are also points of concern. Executions in the US rose for the second year in a row According to Amnesty International's report, 45 people were put to death in the United States in 2018. This is a slight increase from 2017, when 41 were executed. However, in general, the rise is actually small compared to the general downward trend. Read More ""There has been a slight increase in the number of executions [in the US], but it is still within historical lows,"" Chiara Sangiorgio, Amnesty International's Advisor on the Death Penalty, told CNN. ""Over a 10-year-period, we have seen the number of both executions and death sentences decrease."" The death penalty is rare in the US, but is still legal in most states The death penalty is legal in 30 US states, but that number doesn't paint an accurate picture of its actual prevalence. For instance, four US states in which the death penalty is legal are under statewide capital punishment moratoriums imposed by their respective governors. Furthermore, there are several states that recognize the death penalty, but haven't actually executed anyone in years. Sangiorgio says Amnesty International monitors legislative changes and leadership decisions to provide additional insight to their numbers. ""We are seeing a few states resume executions after several years, so we find that concerning,"" Sangiorgio says. ""But the trend in the US is positive. [In 2018], Washington became the 20th state to abolish the death penalty. And we recently saw a strong example of leadership coming from California, where [Governor Gavin Newsom] recently suspended the death penalty ."" Global and national trends account for other decreases Sangiorgio says the historically low number of executions in 2018 was due in part to a significant drop in sentences carried out in some of the world's leading executing countries. For instance, Iran has historically been one of the world's leading executing countries, and the number of executions there dropped by more than 50% in 2018. ""There was a significant drop in executions for drug related offenses in Iran, because of a change in the laws from last year,"" Sangiorgio says. Other countries that lead the implementation of the death penalty, like Pakistan and Iraq, saw an ease in unsually high numbers from last year. And again, the numbers are only half the story. ""There is reason for positive hopes, not only in the drop of executions, but in the number of countries that have decided to abolish the practice,"" Sangiorgio says. ""Burkina Faso , Zambia and Malaysia all abolished or moved toward abolishing the death penalty this year."" However, she points out that other countries like Japan, Singapore and Taiwan resumed executing people after a period of inactivity. When it comes to execution statistics, there is also a China-sized elephant in the room : Since 2009, Amnesty International hasn't counted the number of executions reported in China. ""China has yet to publish any figures on the death penalty; however, available information indicates that each year, thousands of people are executed and sentenced to death,"" the report reads. Amnesty International's reporting also clarifies that many of their numbers are technically minimum estimates, which is why language like ""at least 690 executions"" is used ."
Barr is doing exactly what he came to do: Protecting Trump (opinion) - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Elie Honig,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/opinions/barr-doing-what-he-came-to-do-protect-trump-honig/index.html,"In this weekly column ""Cross-exam,"" Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, gives his take on the latest legal news and answers questions from readers. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on ""CNN Newsroom"" at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays.
(CNN) From day one on the job as attorney general of the United States, William Barr has been prejudiced against the possibility that President Donald Trump committed crimes. I mean ""prejudiced"" in the most literal sense: Barr pre-judged the case in Trump's favor, and he has acted in accordance ever since
Barr's prejudice is not a matter of opinion or debate. It is a matter of public record. In 2017, before he became attorney general, Barr told the New York Times there was a stronger basis to investigate the Clinton Foundation than ""so-called 'collusion.'"" Barr barely concealed a sarcastic eye-roll -- he even put quotation marks around ""collusion."" This is rhetoric you'd expect from Trump's personal counsel, Rudy Giuliani -- not from the future attorney general. Elie Honig Then, in June 2018, Barr sent an unsolicited, 20-page memo to the Department of Justice arguing that Mueller's ""obstruction theory is fatally misconceived."" Barr added the absurd legal view: ""There is no legal prohibition -- as opposed to a political constraint -- against the President's acting on a matter in which he has a personal stake."" Translation: the President is free to tamper with a case that might hurt him because, well, he's the President. Barr also previously told The Hill that Mueller's obstruction investigation was ""asinine."" Again, Barr said this before he became attorney general. There's no way around it. Barr pre-judged the case. Read More Since he became attorney general, Barr has acted exactly as he forecasted, taking pains to sanitize Mueller's findings and protect Trump at every turn. Barr sent a four-page letter to Congress purporting to summarize the conclusions of Mueller's nearly-400 page report. In the letter, Barr sets forth no actual evidence, but nonetheless declares that Trump did not commit an obstruction of justice offense -- contrary to Mueller, who found evidence of obstruction but declined to draw a conclusion about whether the evidence constituted a crime. In his congressional testimony this week, Barr dodged any issue that might cause Trump discomfort. Barr, demonstrating more obvious tells than a rookie poker player in the pit of a Las Vegas casino, declined to give straight answers about whether he had sent a draft of Mueller's report to the White House and whether the President was accurate in claiming total exoneration. What is Barr trying to hide? Barr also informed Congress that he is in the process of redacting parts of Mueller's report and that he expects to release the redacted report publicly by next week. Barr takes a broad view of the types of information that should be redacted -- including grand jury materials -- yet conspicuously fails to pursue available legal mechanisms to minimize redactions and maximize transparency (as discussed in a reader question below). Barr plainly intends to remove as much as the outer limits of the law permit. Don't be surprised when Barr continues to take steps to minimize damage to Trump. Trump, and all of us, already knew where Barr stood before he ever got the job as attorney general. Now Barr is doing exactly what he came to do. Now, your questions. Anson, Washington, DC: Why isn't Barr requesting a federal judge to approve the release of the grand jury information contained in the Mueller report? The short answer is because he likely doesn't want to. Barr wrote to Congress that he is in the process of redacting information from the Mueller report, including grand jury materials, which ""by law cannot be made public."" Mueller served over 2,800 subpoenas , and all of the responsive information qualifies as grand jury material. So, we are talking about a lot of information. As a general matter -- and as Barr asserts -- grand jury materials must be kept secret by law enforcement. But that is only a starting point. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permit the courts to authorize disclosure of grand jury materials in some circumstances, and, in 1998, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr sought and obtained such authorization, which enabled him to include grand jury materials in his report to Congress on President Bill Clinton. Last week, House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler obtained authorization for a congressional subpoena, calling for the full Mueller report, including grand jury materials. (Ironically -- or perhaps predictably, given the nature of politicians -- Nadler took a different position when a President from his own party was under fire in 1998). Nadler offered to work with Barr to seek court authorization to release grand jury materials, but Barr testified in Congress this week that he would not petition the courts and would leave it to Nadler to bring a legal challenge to obtain any redacted information. During his confirmation hearing, Barr vowed to seek ""as much transparency as possible"" regarding Mueller's report. Thus far, he has broken that promise. Barr has options at his disposal to disclose grand jury materials -- yet he will not even try to use them.

House Democrats may have found a silver bullet to obtain Trump's tax returns. Using an obscure provision of the IRS code, Rep. Richard Neal, Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, has filed a formal request with the IRS for Trump's federal tax returns from 2013 through 2018. On its face, the statute squarely supports Neal's request: it provides that ""upon written request,"" the IRS ""shall furnish"" the committee with any requested tax return. Legally and colloquially, ""shall"" means ""must,"" and permits no variation (in contrast to other laws that provide that a person ""may"" do something or ""has authority"" to do something, which are discretionary). The Trump administration has argued that Neal's request is without precedent . Of course, the issue is unprecedented largely because every president dating back to Nixon has voluntarily produced his tax returns. In any event, it hardly matters whether the statute has been used before, given its unambiguous ""shall furnish"" language. White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney has charged that Neal's request is politically motivated. That may be true, but it is irrelevant legally. Meanwhile, another administration official boldly stated that ""this is a hill and people would be willing to die on it,"" but they may well end up dying (so to speak) in vain. Cindy, New York: Regarding Mueller not subpoenaing Trump, is there a rule that if the defendant takes the Fifth, the prosecutor will be barred from subpoenaing the party? Essentially, yes. The Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution provides that ""(n)o person... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself."" Thus, every person -- including the President -- can avoid answering a subpoena by invoking the Fifth Amendment. When that happens, the ball goes back to the prosecutor, who has two choices: either (1) accept the Fifth Amendment invocation and walk away, or (2) obtain immunity for the witness -- meaning the witness must testify, but his own testimony cannot be used against him. Prosecutors grant immunity sparingly because under Department of Justice policy , immunized witnesses presumptively should not be prosecuted for the crimes about which they have testified. So even if Mueller had subpoenaed Trump, Trump absolutely would have had the legal right to invoke the Fifth Amendment and avoid testifying. The problem for Trump would have been more political than legal. It cannot look good to the general public for the President of the United States to take the Fifth Amendment, and Trump himself once declared that ""the mob takes the Fifth."" Because Mueller decided against a subpoena, however, Trump avoided this difficult decision. What we're ignoring about Manafort's sentence Dan, California: Please explain the relationship between a criminal investigation looking for evidence of crime X and finding evidence of crime Y. That was one of Paul Manafort's defenses , and the judge struck it down. Normally, it is quite common for prosecutors to begin by investigating one crime but to end charging something else entirely. I once had a case that began as an investigation of racketeering, extortion and drug trafficking and ended up solving a murder. Prosecutors go wherever the evidence leads, and that often takes investigations down unexpected paths. As special counsel, however, Mueller was given a specific and more limited mandate : to investigate ""any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump"" and ""any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation."" Manafort challenged his prosecution for bank fraud, tax fraud, violations of the foreign lobbying act and other offenses as beyond Mueller's purview. The court rejected Manafort's challenge, however, relying in part on the ""arose or may arise"" provision of Mueller's appointment. Mindful of his limited mandate, Mueller referred matters unrelated to Russian coordination to other Department of Justice prosecutors. Most prominently, Mueller sent the Michael Cohen case to the Southern District of New York. That investigation and others that Mueller referred out will continue beyond Mueller's tenure, and may well lead to additional charges. Donald, Maryland: If the Trump Tower meeting to get dirt on Hillary Clinton isn't collusion, what is it? Mueller did not find sufficient evidence to charge a federal crime relating to the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting , but we do not yet know his reasoning. Here's my breakdown: While the Trump Tower meeting was a terrible idea and a disloyal act, it's a close call whether it was a federal crime. The closest fit is a statute prohibiting any person from accepting, soliciting or receiving a campaign donation from a foreign national. The prosecution theory would be that, even though the Russians never delivered the promised dirt, Donald Trump Jr. nonetheless solicited the information (solicitation itself qualifies under the statute ) and conspired (agreed) with others, including Jared Kushner and Manafort, which is also a crime . On the other hand, attempts and conspiracies are generally less attractive to prosecutors than completed crimes. Charges sometimes lack jury appeal and moral heft if the intended crime never actually happened. Mueller also might have struggled with whether the offered ""dirt"" qualified as a campaign contribution. I would argue that the hacked emails would have benefited Trump more than any paid ad, for example, and held enormous value to the campaign. But Mueller might have concluded that the emails carried no particular, quantifiable monetary value -- indeed, the Russian state ultimately made hacked emails available to the public through Wikileaks for free -- and so they did not qualify under the statute. Or perhaps Trump Jr. and company planned to pay for the emails, which would take them outside the realm of campaign contributions. Many questions remain, and there's only one way to know Mueller's reasoning for sure: full disclosure of his report. Three questions to watch for next week: Stay up to date...

Follow @cnnsport For Barcelona, a precious victory. For its captain, the mercurial Lionel Messi, a bloodied nose and a black eye courtesy of a Chris Smalling challenge. On a quiet night for Messi, a 12th minute own-goal by Luke Shaw, the defender deflecting the ball into his own net after Luis Suarez had headed across the six-yard area, proved the difference in a scrappy and often underwhelming affair. Shaw's own-goal was initially ruled out for offside but then reinstated by VAR, the video assistant referee, as technology took center stage in the Champions League for the second consecutive evening . Not that United had any ground for complaint. The home side hardly looked capable of finding an equalizer and rarely threatened as Barcelona controlled the contest without ever moving out of second gear.

There is a reason that Barcelona, 11 points clear at the top of La Liga and beaten just once in all competitions since January 23, remains the hot favorite for the Champions League title. Much of that optimism centers around Messi, who arrived at Old Trafford having scored 13 goals in his past nine games. Yet, it was his strike partner Suarez, the scorer of seven goals in his past nine games, that appeared the more threatening of the duo as was evident as early as the 12th minute. Messi, taking the ball onto his left foot, produced a perfect cross for his strike partner and the Uruguayan's header was deflected into the net by Shaw. Luis Suarez contests an offside decision that was eventually overturned as Barcelona took the lead against Manchester United. Yet, as Suarez sprinted away to celebrate, the assistant referee raised his flag for offside.

Does VAR ruin the beautiful game? 02:22 While those inside the stadium awaited news, or any inkling of what may be happening, the players stood and waited. For supporters watching on television there are no shortage of replays or information, but for those inside the stadium, it is often a feeling of bemusement. No big screens, no replays, no information. Finally, referee Gianluca Rocchi blew his whistle and awarded the goal. Suddenly those United fans that had offered Suarez their opinion were reticent. Suarez, who had been indignant at the original ruling, celebrated in front of the famed Stretford End, before being ensconced inside a luminous yellow huddle of happiness. Barcelona players celebrate after scoring against Manchester United. United, which had not faced Barcelona since losing to the Catalan side in the 2011 final of the competition at Wembley, struggled to cope with the pace and movement of the visiting side's front three. Philippe Coutinho, another former Liverpool player who was given a suitable Manchester welcome, almost doubled his side's lead before the interval only to be denied by David de Gea's outstanding save. United, sixth in the English Premier League and struggling to qualify for next season's Champions League, appeared caught between containing Barcelona and attempting to find an equalizer. Diogo Dalot spurned United's best opportunity; heading across goal from close-range when he should have powered his effort toward Marc-Andre ter Stegen in the Barca goal.

Chuck Grassley: White House won't give assurances Lee Francis Cissna's job is safe - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Phil Mattingly,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/lee-francis-cissna-chuck-grassley/index.html,"(CNN) Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who for days has urged the White House both publicly and privately not to fire a top immigration official, said Wednesday he hasn't received any assurances his efforts will work -- and will have to accept it if they do not.
""I've concluded that they're taking it under consideration,"" Grassley told reporters of his efforts to keep Lee Francis Cissna in his job as the top official at the US Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Grassley said he hasn't spoken directly to the President. ""I spoke about the competence of people I know,"" Grassley said of his message to White House officials. For Grassley, it's both personal and policy related -- Cissna worked for the Iowa senator when Grassley chaired the Judiciary Committee. But beyond that, Grassley has said he views Cissna as a competent official who can help the Trump achieve his goals -- goals Grassley said he shares. But he also appeared resigned to the fact that the decision was out of his hands. ""I know the President's goals on immigration are the same as mine, pretty much the same as mine I would say, and that the President's gotta have people in place who will do his job and since his goals are the same as mine I'm gonna have to accept it,"" Grassley said.

Black hole: MIT graduate student helped create algorithm used to capture image - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Michelle Lou and Saeed Ahmed, CNN",04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/katie-bouman-mit-black-hole-algorithm-sci-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Imagine trying to take a photo of an orange that's on the moon with your smartphone. It seems impossible.
That's what it was like for scientists trying to capture an image of a black hole in space. Despite the tall order, an international team of more than 200 researchers unveiled the first-ever image of a black hole on Wednesday. The effort wouldn't have been possible without Katie Bouman, who developed a crucial algorithm that helped devise imaging methods. Three years ago, Bouman led the creation of an algorithm that eventually helped capture this first-of-its-kind image: a supermassive black hole and its shadow at the center of a galaxy known as M87. She was then a graduate student in computer science and artificial intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Black holes are extremely far away and compact, so taking a photo of one is no easy task. In addition, black holes by definition are supposed to be invisible -- although they can give off a shadow when they interact with the material around them. Read More A global network of telescopes known as the Event Horizon Telescope project collected millions of gigabytes of data about M87 using a technique known as interferometry. However, there were still large gaps in the data that needed to be filled in. Her algorithm, and many others, helped fill in the gaps That's where Bouman's algorithm -- along with several others -- came in. Using imaging algorithms like Bouman's, researchers created three scripted code pipelines to piece together the picture. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) -- a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration -- was designed to capture images of a black hole. Today, in coordinated press conferences across the globe, EHT researchers reveal that they have succeeded, unveiling the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow. They took the ""sparse and noisy data"" that the telescopes spit out and tried to make an image. For the past few years, Bouman directed the verification of images and selection of imaging parameters. ""We developed ways to generate synthetic data and used different algorithms and tested blindly to see if we can recover an image,"" she told CNN. ""We didn't want to just develop one algorithm. We wanted to develop many different algorithms that all have different assumptions built into them. If all of them recover the same general structure, then that builds your confidence."" The result? A groundbreaking image of a lopsided, ring-like structure that Albert Einstein predicted more than a century ago in his theory of general relativity. In fact, the researchers had generated several photos and they all looked the same. The image of the black hole presented on Wednesday was not from any one method, but all the images from different algorithms that were blurred together. ""No matter what we did, you would have to bend over backwards crazy to get something that wasn't this ring,"" Bouman said. Bouman was a crucial member of the imaging team ""(Bouman) was a major part of one of the imaging subteams,"" said Vincent Fish, a research scientist at MIT's Haystack Observatory. ""One of the insights Katie brought to our imaging group is that there are natural images,"" Fish said. ""Just think about the photos you take with your camera phone -- they have certain properties. ... If you know what one pixel is, you have a good guess as to what the pixel is next to it."" For example, there are areas that are smoother and areas that have sharp boundaries. Astronomical images share these properties, and you can mathematically encode these properties, Fish said. Junior members like Bouman made significant contributions to the project, he added. Of course, senior scientists worked on the project, but the imaging portion was mostly led by junior researchers, such as graduate students and post docs. ""No one of us could've done it alone,"" Bouman said. ""It came together because of lots of different people from many backgrounds."" Bouman starts teaching as an assistant professor at California Institute of Technology in the fall."

(CNN) Tuesday's showdown between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters offered a handy lesson in classic ""mansplaining.""
For anyone not versed in the term -- though few women have been fortunate enough to not experience it themselves -- mansplaining is when a man tries to explain something to a woman, the ""slower species,"" in a condescending or patronizing way. But it's one thing for a woman to experience it in a meeting at work or at a party with some boorish guy spelling things out. It's quite another to have it demonstrated so ably on national television by an official in an administration that is rapidly shedding women in high positions, and to see it satisfyingly slapped down by a woman -- another highly-placed government official, in this case. In this, Maxine Waters did women (and men), young and old, a favor by publicly identifying what was happening -- and modeling how to respond. Here's how it went down : Mnuchin was appearing before the committee to discuss his plans for responding to Democrats' requests for President Donald Trump's tax returns. Mnuchin wanted to leave at 5:15 to get to another meeting on his schedule. Waters would not relent; she urged him to stay until 5:30, so that the full committee could question him. Read More After a tense exchange, with Mnuchin checking his watch, appearing to be gathering his papers to leave, he said, ""If you'd wish to keep me here so I don't have my important meeting, and continue to grill me, then we can do that. I will cancel my meeting and I will not be back here."" JUST WATCHED Mnuchin: Haven't talked to White House about Trump's taxes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Mnuchin: Haven't talked to White House about Trump's taxes 03:13 She took him up on it; he appeared stunned. ""You made me an offer. I accepted,"" said Waters. ""I did not make you an offer; let's be clear,"" Mnuchin huffed. ""You're instructing me, you're ordering me to stay here."" She told him he was free to leave when he wanted. Instead of appealing to her in a reasonable, mature, respectful way, however, he chose the sarcastic, arrogant, belittling route of a bully -- and a mansplainer -- offering her detailed instructions on how to end the meeting, as if she were a child and did not understand the problem here. ""Please dismiss everybody,"" Mnuchin told Waters, his impatience and irritation evident. And then, raising his arm and miming banging a gavel, ""I believe you are supposed to take the gravel [sic] and bang it."" (Please note that in treating Waters as if she were too unintelligent to know how to end her own hearing, or even to operate a gavel, he misnamed the instrument she would use to end it, calling it a ""gravel."") Although a new-ish term, described in 2008 by author Rebecca Solnit in a piece entitled ""Men Explain Things to Me; Facts Didn't Get in Their Way,"" mansplaining is certainly not a new phenomenon. Men have been explaining things to women for years. As more and more women come to positions of power equal to those of men, however, it's being called out more and more. Perhaps as cover for this infantilizing of women, men sometimes portray it as the kind of all-in-good-fun ""ball-busting"" they engage each other with. In this reading, women are supposed to stop being so sensitive and just take it, just like the guys would. That's of course nonsense.

Meanwhile, it's likely that if roles had been reversed -- had Waters or any female politician interacted with a man in such a manner, whether or not he was in charge, she'd have been hung out to dry. It's possible that Mnuchin, who has become known for his arrogance, would have responded the same way to a male colleague refusing to give him his way -- particularly a Democrat asking tough questions about his boss.

The researchers imaged the brains of 26 living former football players and compared them with the brains of 31 people with no history of traumatic brain injury. The brains of the former players were more likely to light up and signal tau deposits than those of people who hadn't had a brain injury. Furthermore, the scans detected tau in the same regions where tau has posthumously been found in CTE-diseased brains. ""This is an important next step, but it doesn't mean we have the answer yet,"" said lead study author Robert Stern , director of clinical research for Boston University's Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center. CTE was discovered in the brain of a former football player, Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster, during an autopsy in 2002. In the 17 years since, over 100 former National Football League players have been diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease, along with other athletes, military veterans and victims of abuse, after their deaths. Yet there is still no way to diagnose it in the living. Read More Looking inside the brain Previous studies have used other tracers to attempt to image tau, but those agents weren't as specific in distinguishing tau from beta amyloid, the protein that signifies Alzheimer's disease. ""The newer-generation tracers are much more specific for tau,"" said Neil Vasdev, director of the Azrieli Centre for Neuro-Radiochemistry. Vasdev was not directly involved in the study analysis but helped the research team set up the radiochemistry protocol used in the centers that conducted the study. Scientists believe that CTE results from repeated head trauma. In football, this can happen not just from hard hits to the head that result in concussion but from the constant rattling of the brain inside the skull that occurs during tackles and other plays. These repeated hits are known as subconcussive hits and can result in a buildup of tau. CTE develops when the protein begins clumping around small blood vessels and in the valley of the cortex. From there, the protein spreads and destroys other parts of the brain. There is no cure for CTE. Why do some people get CTE? It may be in their genes The neurodegenerative disease results in Alzheimer's-like symptoms including mood swings, memory loss and impulsive behavior. As the disease progresses, it can also lead to paranoia, dementia and suicidal thoughts. For the new study to evaluate the connection between tau and the players' potential behavioral and cognitive symptoms, the researchers gave all the participants tests that assessed executive function, mood and memory. The researchers did not identify the former players involved in the study. Stern and his colleagues found that there wasn't an association between how much tau was detected and the players' test scores, but the more years played, the higher the amount of tau deposition in the brain. A step forward To confirm that the symptoms that players reported weren't related to Alzheimer's, the researchers also imaged the participants for beta amyloid proteins using florbetapir, one of the most widely used imaging tracers. Researchers found that the former players had similar levels of beta amyloid proteins as the control group. The players involved in the study were males between the ages of 40 and 69 who had played in the NFL for at least two years and played a minimum 12 years total of tackle football. Quarterbacks, kickers, special teams players and players who had reported a traumatic brain injury in the prior year were excluded from the study. The study was funded in part by Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Eli Lilly and maker of the two tracer agents used in the research. Football affects youth brain development after just one season, study says Despite the relatively small numbers of players tested, Vasdev believes that the findings could have long-lasting implications. ""It's really that first step that will generate more scientific data and discussions around diagnostics and treatment options or management options for patients suffering from traumatic brain injuries,"" he said. The 26 players who Stern and his colleagues evaluated make up the largest group to date using this method to signal tau. But there are still a number of questions to be answered. Why does the disease progress more severely in some than in others? Why do some people develop the disease at all? Within the next five years, Stern believes, scientists will have a meaningful way to diagnose CTE in the living. He and his colleagues are further analyzing a larger sample of players to help get there. ""We can refine our ways of analyzing this tracer in this larger sample and hopefully move this field even further,"" he said.

Stern has been vocal about his concerns about links between football and CTE, testifying before Congress in 2014 and 2017 about the dangers of repeated head trauma. A 2016 congressional report found that when the NFL learned that Stern's research proposal had been selected by the National Institutes of Health as part of a NIH-NFL grant partnership, the NFL tried to pull its funding. Ultimately, the National Institutes of Health funded Stern's work. Stern is cautious but optimistic about the results of this study. ""This is an exciting scientific finding,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean we are there yet. Lots more work needs to be done."""
Sam Elliott was once told to alter his iconic speaking voice - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Chloe Melas,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/entertainment/sam-elliott-interview/index.html,"(CNN) Sam Elliott's deep, resonant voice has helped to distinguish him in Hollywood over the course of his 40-year career.
But, remarkably, he was once told to alter it. In fact, Elliott, who was nominated for an Oscar for his role in ""A Star Is Born"" this past year, recently told CNN that an actor rep told him early in his career that he wouldn't see success without changing his voice. ""When I was looking for an agent, I went and met with this guy,"" Elliott said. ""They had a portfolio full of photographs and he was thumbing through these photographs and he closed the book and slid the book back over to me and said, 'If I was you, I'd go back to Portland, Oregon. and if you're going to stay in this town, you should take some voice and diction lessons and learn how to talk and get rid of that dialect.'"" Elliott obviously didn't take that advice. Read More He made his film debut in 1967's ""The Way West"" and went on to other Westerns such as ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" His breakout role came in 1985's ""Mask,"" alongside Cher. He's starred in more than 30 films, appeared in over 40 television shows and has lent his now iconic voice to countless projects. ""I think I grew up thinking about my voice as kind of funny because it had this Southwest dialect to it. I sounded very much like my mom in terms of the dialect,"" Elliott said. ""I knew that through this years, particularly as I grew older, that I developed this different sound. So I guess I knew at some point before I got into the business that my voice was going to be part of it."" Following the success of ""A Star Is Born,"" in which Elliott plays Bobby Maine, the brother of Bradley Cooper's character, he's not slowing down. Currently, he can be seen in the action/drama movie, ""The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot."" ""The fact that I'm still at it after 50 years is a wonderful thing,"" he said. As for what's on the horizon? ""I'd love to do a musical one day, if it's in the cards. I just like doing good work and working with good people."""
Bungee cord to the eye causes man's iris to collapse - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Susan Scutti,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/health/collapsed-iris-case-study/index.html,"(CNN) For an entire week, the man had pain in his left eye as well as blurred double vision. Finally, the 48-year-old, who requested anonymity, visited National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei.
A brief physical examination by Dr. Wei Li Chen and Dr. Chia-Chieh Hsiao , physicians and researchers in the hospital's Department of Ophthalmology, revealed left eyelid bruising and an artfully, if painfully, distorted left pupil. The eye's single opening, the pupil is an aperture through which light travels to reach the retina, a thin layer of tissue lining the back wall of the eye. The retina's photoreceptor cells convert light into signals sent to the back of the brain, where the visual cortex assembles the information and decides what is being seen. Fascinating, mysterious, and medically amazing case files. This series is the most interesting education into the world of medicine and disease and the human body.
The patient sat behind a slit lamp so his doctors could perform a more thorough inspection of his injured left eye. The slit lamp, ubiquitous in eye doctor offices, is the clunky tool that requires you to rest your chin on one support and place your forehead against another while your uncomfortably close doctor peers through a microscope into your eyes. The slit lamp focuses a narrow band of light into the eyes, providing a magnified, three-dimensional view of both front and back of the ""windows of the soul."" Another view of the patient's iris. Read More This second examination of the patient's left eye revealed an iris ""with the upper portion sagging downward, detached from the 9 o'clock position to the 3 o'clock position,"" Chen and Hsiao wrote in a case study on the man's injury, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. A separation of the iris like this ""can cause multiple pupils, leading to monocular double vision, blurry vision or photophobia"" (an inability to tolerate light), they told CNN in an email. Laser pointer burns hole in boy's retina So what caused the rare injury? A rubber bungee cord that the man used to strap goods onto a motorcycle had struck him directly in the eye. The iris is ""what we recognize as the colored part of the eye,"" explained Dr. Nicholas P. Bell, a professor of ophthalmology and visual science with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston. ""Muscles in the iris can cause the pupil to open or close to control how much light gets into the eye under different ambient lighting conditions, similar to how you can adjust the aperture on a camera lens,"" said Bell, who did not treat this particular patient. In a dark room, the pupil opens wide to let in more light, and on a sunny day, the pupil will constrict to reduce the amount of incoming light. Though Chen and Hsiao saw no evidence of cataract, retinal injury or lens dislocation, the separation of the iris from the band of muscles that sits behind it easily accounted for the patient's blurred and double vision. This damage is known as traumatic iridodialysis. Group of rare eye cancer cases baffles experts Bell said the condition is ""relatively uncommon,"" though when it does occur, sports or work-related activities are often the cause. But there are others. ""Bungee cord and airbag injuries seem to more frequently result in traumatic iridodialysis because of the focally concentrated strong force,"" Bell said, adding that airbags save lives, and fear of this extremely rare eye injury is no reason for avoiding them. Dr. J. Martin Heur, medical director of the USC Roski Eye Institute and associate professor of clinical ophthalmology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, agreed that this injury is ""very rare, but I've had a handful of people who've had this happen to them."" ""The trauma can be caused by anything that doesn't penetrate the eye"" but still causes ""the iris to tear at the root like that,"" said Heur, who was not involved in this patient's care. Balls such as golf balls are likely culprits, he said. To repair the damage, the Taiwanese patient underwent surgery that restored the pupil shape and improved his vision. Heur said this surgery, known as iridoplasty, is ""usually done in an operating room"" and ""is relatively short: approximately 30 minutes."" The procedure involves McCannel sutures, basically when a surgeon carefully sews the iris back to the inner wall of the eye. These health problems can be predicted with a look into your eyes Heur added that after an iridoplasty, a patient has to be careful for about a week or two about lifting heaving objects or getting water in the eye. Once healed, a patient needs to be monitored regularly for life, because glaucoma can develop even years after the injury. One year later, the Taiwan patient's iris remained attached with only ""mild deformity,"" Chen and Hsiao said. Though there's no evidence of glaucoma so far, the patient now wears glasses to help him achieve 20/50 vision in the injured eye: He needs to be within 20 feet to see what people with healthy vision can spot at 50 feet. Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg , a professor and chair of ophthalmology at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University, said he saw a similarly severe injury ""after a fisherman had a steel cable snap back into his eye."" The health benefits of a colorful life ""Because some of the effects of eye trauma can be asymptomatic and appear four to six weeks later, it is important to get a complete eye exam with a professional eye care provider both immediately after severe trauma and a month or two later to be safe,"" said Goldberg, who did not treat the Taiwanese patient. Although this level of injury is rare, ""less severe iridodialyses happen more often with moderate to severe eye trauma,"" he said. When small tears occur on the very edge of the iris, they can ""lead to scarring on that area that subsequently blocks the drain of the eye, leading to higher eye pressure and glaucoma.""

(CNN) Visiting Mount Vernon with French President Emmanuel Macron, the least curious American president in history heard one thing that surely caught his attention, according to an account in Politico .
In his time, George Washington may have been the richest man in America. Trump is spouting nonsense at a greater rate For President Donald Trump, who considers money to be the measure of a man, this fact must have felt like a punch in the gut. The Politico story quotes a source familiar with the visit as saying Washington's wealth was ""what Trump was really the most excited about."" Trump has always made his riches, or at least his claim to great wealth, the center of his appeal for attention and respect. With varied claims to being a billionaire five, eight, or 10 times over, Trump used his reputation of wealth and success to sell himself as a real estate developer, television personality and finally candidate for president. Ensconced in the Oval Office, he has expanded his boasts to endorse the claim that his is the ""best presidency ever"" and to tell the Sun newspaper in the United Kingdom that he has beaten ""our Honest Abe"" in a popularity contest among Republicans. Read More Given the famous (if apocryphal) tale about Washington's honesty ‚Äî ""I cannot tell a lie,"" said young George ‚Äî our first president must have rolled over in his nearby grave as Trump shambled around Mount Vernon. With more than 9,000 false or misleading statements by the count of the Washington Post , our current president is the first's opposite when it comes to veracity, character and, it would seem, dignity. Washington was so humble they had to force the office upon him . Trump is so unhinged in his self-regard that he can't understand why anyone would deny him anything. In an effort to get billions for his border wall, Trump even declared and perpetuated a dubious national emergency. Trump's odd riffs According to Politico , which reported on the Trump-Macron tour of Washington's home, Trump took special note of the narrow staircases, the small rooms and uneven floors. Thus he applied knowledge from the one thing he knows the most about, real estate, to something he should grasp but doesn't -- namely, the history of the nation he now leads. The sacrilege of our 45th president's comments in his visit to the home of our first was described to Politico as ""truly bizarre."" The tour guide, a historian with a doctorate who is chief executive of the association that runs the historic site, reportedly struggled to hold Trump's attention. For his part, Trump made an impression with a derisive quip about how Washington erred by not fixing his name to his estate. ""You've got to put your name in stuff or no one remembers you,"" was what Trump reportedly said. Assuming that Trump knows that Washington's face is on the dollar bill, and that he understands that he lives in the city named for the founding father, he must have been joking. Of course with Trump you never know. He's not known for his sense of humor or for being comfortable with comedy. Indeed, most of his humor is declared in the style of the man who insults you and then tries to cover his hostility by insisting, ""I'm joking!"" Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

The spectacle of Trump's visit to Mount Vernon -- where, it must be said, French President Macron apparently showed great knowledge of George Washington, according to Politico -- would be funny if it weren't such an accurate illustration of the man who now sits at the Resolute Desk. Trump is so unread, so lacking in curiosity and so little concerned with the awesome responsibilities he owns that he is frightening to many Americans -- and to people around the world. The Mount Vernon debacle shows he isn't interested in learning from the successes and, more importantly the failures of those who went before him. He seems to prefer making his own mistakes. There's nothing funny about that."
"On rising insulin prices, lawmaker tells pharma execs: 'Your days are numbered' - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Jacqueline Howard,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/health/insulin-prices-congressional-hearing-bn/index.html,"(CNN) Lawmakers tensed with frustration, some clenching their jaws, while grilling a panel of pharmacy and pharmaceutical company executives about the soaring cost of insulin during a congressional hearing on Wednesday. The tension could be felt as some executives fidgeted in their chairs while answering lawmakers' questions.
The hearing , held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce's Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee on Capitol Hill, was the second this month to examine how fast-rising insulin costs affect diabetes patients across the United States. The average price of insulin tripled over the course of a decade, from $4.34 per milliliter in 2002 to $12.92 per milliliter in 2013, according to a study published in the medical journal JAMA in 2016.

Why is health care in the US so expensive? 02:15 Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky vehemently said during the hearing that prices of insulin are ""curiously close"" between manufacturers and ""way too high."" ""I don't know how you people sleep at night,"" she told the panel of executives. Read More ""We have the names of people who have died because they couldn't get their insulin,"" she said. ""This is a commitment on the part of the Congress to get drug prices -- particularly life-saving life necessities -- to get those prices under control. ... Your days are numbered."" In response, several executives -- including Doug Langa of Novo Nordisk and Kathleen Tregoning of Sanofi -- pointed to how the health care system is ""broken,"" and they all agreed it was unacceptable that some patients are struggling to afford medications. As the hearing adjourned, lawmakers made clear that an investigation into the rising cost of insulin and what can be done about the issue will continue. Companies aim to lower costs; lawmakers argue it's not enough People with diabetes are prescribed insulin because their bodies either do not produce it (as with Type 1 diabetes) or do not use it properly (as with Type 2 diabetes). There are more than 20 types of insulin sold in the United States, according to the American Diabetes Association . JUST WATCHED Diabetes is on the rise Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Diabetes is on the rise 01:15 Ahead of Wednesday's hearing, pharmaceutical company Sanofi announced plans to reduce the price of insulin for qualifying patients to $99 a month for up to 10 boxes of pens or 10-milliliter vials. The new monthly price for qualifying patients will start in June, according to the company. ""It is unacceptable to Sanofi that some people living with diabetes are struggling to pay for their insulin, so we have moved to act creatively and aggressively to help address affordability and access needs,"" Michelle Carnahan, head of North America Primary Care at Sanofi, said in the announcement. ""By giving those who require both long-acting and/or mealtime insulins or use more than one box of pens or one vial per month access to their insulins for one flat price, we aim to help limit the burden on the individuals who have high out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy counter,"" she said. New insulin price won't top $25 a month out-of-pocket, Cigna says US Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who helped launch a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices in February, called the move ""a step in the right direction"" in a written statement Wednesday. ""But like Cigna's announcement on insulin prices last week, this raises a lot of questions. Why was Sanofi charging so much more before this announcement? What took them so long to offer the price reduction?"" he added. ""It shouldn't take months of bad press, persistent public outcry and increasing congressional scrutiny to get a company to charge a fair price. That's not how a functioning marketplace works."" Health insurer Cigna said last week that it's launching a program that will cap out-of-pocket expenses at $25 for a 30-day supply of insulin. Last year, patients paid an average of $41.50 a month out of pocket, including deductibles, copays or coinsurance, for the lifesaving diabetes drug, according to the company. Its Patient Assurance Program will be available to members of participating nongovernment-funded pharmacy plans managed by Express Scripts, including Cigna and other plans. Cigna acquired Express Scripts, the largest US pharmacy benefit management company, in December. ""In most cases, people who use insulin will see lower out-of-pocket costs without any increased cost to the plan,"" the company said. 'A matter of life and death' Also last week, the US Food and Drug Administration announced that it intends to bring competition to the insulin market as a way to lower prices. Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said the agency would change how insulin is regulated in order to enable products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, insulin to come to market. Amid uproar over high drug prices, Eli Lilly introduces generic insulin at half price of brand-name Humalog ""Access to affordable insulin can be a matter of life and death for Americans with diabetes. Insulin is a critical hormone that regulates sugar metabolism,"" Gottlieb said in the announcement. ""But access to this critical drug can be increasingly difficult for these Americans. Insulin list prices regularly increase by double digits annually,"" he said. ""Driving down drug prices requires a comprehensive approach. But one impactful route is through competition. This is particularly true following the introductions of generics, especially when there are three or more generic competitors -- which has been shown to bring down prices more sharply than with only one or two generic competitors.""

In March, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced plans to sell a cheaper generic version of its rapid-acting insulin Humalog. At half the price of Humalog, the generic insulin lispro will carry a list price of $137.35 per vial, the company said, or $265.20 for a pack of five pens. Brand-name Humalog will remain on the market. Colorado Rep. Diana DeGette, chairwoman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, said at Wednesday's hearing that Humalog cost only $35 a vial in 2001 and that the price increased even though the drug formulary remained the same. ""Let's not kid ourselves that the generic equivalent of this is really any cheaper,"" she said shortly before the hearing adjourned."
Black hole photo: View first image captured by Event Horizon telescope - CNN,www.cnn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/10/world/black-hole-photo-scn/index.html,"This is the first photo of a black hole By Ashley Strickland, CNN Updated 12:40 PM EDT, Wed April 10, 2019
(CNN) In April 2017, scientists used a global network of telescopes to see and capture the first-ever picture of a black hole, according to an announcement by researchers at the National Science Foundation Wednesday morning. They captured an image of the supermassive black hole and its shadow at the center of a galaxy known as M87.
This is the first direct visual evidence that black holes exist, the researchers said. In the image, a central dark region is encapsulated by a ring of light that looks brighter on one side.
The massive galaxy, called Messier 87 or M87, is near the Virgo galaxy cluster 55 million light-years from Earth. The supermassive black hole has a mass that is 6.5 billion times that of our sun.
""We have seen what we thought was unseeable,"" said Sheperd Doeleman, director of the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. ""We have seen and taken a picture of a black hole."" The black hole image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration.
The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration, called EHT, is a global network of telescopes that captured the first-ever photograph of a black hole. More than 200 researchers were involved in the project. They have worked for more than a decade to capture this. The project is named for the event horizon, the proposed boundary around a black hole that represents the point of no return where no light or radiation can escape.
In their attempt to capture an image of a black hole, scientists combined the power of eight radio telescopes around the world using Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry, according to the European Southern Observatory, which is part of the EHT. This effectively creates a virtual telescope around the same size as the Earth itself.
The telescopes involved in creating the global array included ALMA, APEX, the IRAM 30-meter telescope, the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, the Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano, the Submillimeter Array, the Submillimeter Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. Stephen Hawking paper on black holes and 'soft hair' released
""The observations were a coordinated dance in which we simultaneously pointed our telescopes in a carefully planned sequence,"" said Daniel Marrone, associate professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona. ""To make sure these observations were truly simultaneous, so that we could see the same wavefront of light as it landed on each telescope, we used extremely precise atomic clocks at each of the telescopes.""
The telescope array collected 5,000 trillion bytes of data over two weeks, which was processed through supercomputers so that the scientists could retrieve the images.
Details of the observation were published in a series of six research papers published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters . What are black holes?
Black holes are made up of huge amounts of matter squeezed into a small area, according to NASA , creating a massive gravitational field which draws in everything around it, including light. They also have a way of super-heating the material around them and warping spacetime. Material accumulates around black holes, is heated to billions of degrees and reaches nearly the speed of light. Light bends around the gravity of the black hole, which creates the photon ring seen in the image.
The imaging methods used to capture the photo reveal that the supermassive black hole has a ring-like structure and a shadow, which is represented by a dark central region. Astronomers have found the fastest-growing black hole ever seen, and it's got a monster appetite
""If immersed in a bright region, like a disc of glowing gas, we expect a black hole to create a dark region similar to a shadow -- something predicted by Einstein's general relativity that we've never seen before,"" said Heino Falcke, chair of the EHT Science Council. ""This shadow, caused by the gravitational bending and capture of light by the event horizon, reveals a lot about the nature of these fascinating objects and allowed us to measure the enormous mass of M87's black hole.""
The visual confirmation of black holes acts as confirmation of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. In the theory, Einstein predicted that dense, compact regions of space would have such intense gravity that nothing could escape them. But if heated materials in the form of plasma surround the black hole and emit light, the event horizon could be visible.
""Once we were sure we had imaged the shadow, we could compare our observations to extensive computer models that include the physics of warped space, superheated matter and strong magnetic fields. Many of the features of the observed image match our theoretical understanding surprisingly well,"" said Paul T.P. Ho, EHT Board member and director of the East Asian Observatory. ""This makes us confident about the interpretation of our observations, including our estimation of the black hole's mass."" These are the first massive black holes from the early universe
M87's black hole has an enormous mass, which gave researchers reason to believe it may be the largest viewable black hole from Earth. Relative to other objects, supermassive black holes are actually small. This is why they couldn't be observed before. Black hole size is directly related to mass. The larger the black hole, the larger the shadow. And black holes may seem invisible, but the way they interact with the material around them is the giveaway, the researchers said.
""Black holes have sparked imaginations for decades,"" said National Science Foundation director France C√≥rdova. ""They have exotic properties and are mysterious to us. Yet with more observations like this one they are yielding their secrets. This is why NSF exists. We enable scientists and engineers to illuminate the unknown, to reveal the subtle and complex majesty of our universe."" Jack Guy contributed to this report. "
Donald Trump claims he might 'call up more military' to the US-Mexico border - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Maegan Vazquez,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/donald-trump-send-more-military-to-the-border/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump told reporters during a roundtable event on Wednesday that he is ""going to have to call up more military"" to the southern border, adding to the administration's attempts to address a historic increase in the number of migrant apprehensions .
""I'm going to have to call up more military. Our military, don't forget, can't act like they would normally act because if they got a little rough, everybody would go crazy,"" Trump told reporters in San Antonio, Texas, a city with so many military bases in the area that it's been given the nickname ""Military City, USA."" ""They have all these horrible laws that the Democrats won't change, they will not change them. And I think they will pay a very big price in 2020 for all of the things,"" Trump said. ""I think the border is going to be an incredible issue."" The President's call to add more troops to the southern border comes after the Department of Homeland Security released data on Tuesday which confirmed that last month Border Patrol apprehended more people on the southern border than any month since 2008. Mexico is apprehending more migrants. Is it because of Trump? Department of Homeland Security officials have said the influx of migrants has led to a breaking point for their agency. This week it was announced that the agency's leader, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, as well as her second-in-command, acting deputy Claire Grady, would be leaving the department. Read More Amid the influx, Trump last week floated the idea of closing the southern border before changing his mind . There have been thousands of American troops deployed to the southern border over the last year. At its peak, some 5,900 trooped were there as part of the border mission, which has involved surveillance, aviation support and the placement of concertina wire between ports of entry. Though a plan to add more troops to the border has not been announced, acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan was summoned to the White House late Tuesday to discuss the situation at the southern border shortly after his return from Colorado, according to two US defense officials. On Wednesday, Shanahan seemed to telegraph something could be coming with troops traveling to the border when he was asked whether he envisioned multi-year deployments to the border will last longer than 2019. ""That's one of the things that the Chairman (of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) and I have talked quite a bit about and I'm continuing conversations. I am going to work very closely with the new acting secretary (of the Department of Homeland Security),"" Shanahan said. ""What I would say is as the situation there deteriorates, it's pretty elastic in terms of demand on us, so I would expect shortly here to have another request for assistance."""

Congressional Democrats have rallied around Obamacare, while some of the party's presidential nominees are supporting ""Medicare for All"" plans that would offer universal, government-backed health coverage. President Donald Trump, who campaigned in 2016 on repealing the law, has promised that Republicans will pass a ""really great"" health care plan after the 2020 election, although none has been proposed. Trump says GOP will be the party of health care but provides no plan The administration last month sided with Republican-led states that are pushing for the law to be invalidated by the courts. Read More Attorney General William Barr said Wednesday he believes the Justice Department's decision not to argue in favor of upholding the Affordable Care Act is a ""defensible legal position to take."" Initially, the Trump administration argued that two key provisions of the law that protect people with pre-existing conditions could no longer be defended, but the rest of the law could stand. But after a district court ruled in December 2018 that the entire law should be invalidated, the Justice Department changed its position and argues the district court ruling should be upheld in full. As the administration debated its litigation strategy, Barr at first opposed to fully striking down the law. On Wednesday, he suggested that he is ready to back the administration's position. When California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein pressed on why Barr, as attorney general, didn't think it was his ""duty to defend"" the current law, Barr doubled down. ""Well, the law was originally upheld because the (individual) mandate was upheld as a tax,"" Barr said of the 2012 Supreme Court decision that upheld the law. The inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare ""Once the penalty was removed, the financial penalty was removed, that provision could no longer be justified as a tax which means that it would have to fall. So the mandate fell,"" he added, referring to Congress' decision in 2017 to effectively remove the penalty for not having insurance. ""Then the question becomes if the mandate falls, even though there was no penalty attached to it, what's its impact on the rest of the statute? Four of the justices in the (2012 case) felt that the whole statute had to fall. So, as I said before you arrived, senator, you know at the end of the day, I felt that this was defensible legal position to take."" RELATED: The inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare Feinstein also pressed Barr on who in the administration changed its stance. ""Is this determined by the White House?"" she asked. Barr said that it was ""determined by the process within the executive branch"" and a ""number of different players."" ""Well, I assume you wouldn't take this position unless this is what the President wanted,"" Feinstein added. ""Well -- that would be a safe assumption,"" Barr said. The administration's latest court filing came after months of heated internal debate that pitted Barr along with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar against acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and officials aligned with him, a source close to the White House told CNN at the time. Trump attorney general on ACA lawsuit: 'Let the courts do their job' Overturning the law would have far-reaching consequences -- way beyond disrupting coverage for the millions of people who get their health insurance on the exchanges or through Medicaid expansion. Obamacare saves senior citizens money on their Medicare coverage and prescription drugs. It lets many Americans obtain free birth control, mammograms and cholesterol tests. And it allows children to stay on their parents' health insurance plans until they turn 26. Because the Trump administration is no longer defending the law in court, a coalition of 21 Democratic states led by California has stepped in to do so. ""Before the ACA, 133 million Americans faced barriers to coverage because of a pre-existing condition like diabetes or pregnancy -- yes, pregnancy,"" California's Attorney General Becerra said in a statement on Wednesday. ""We will be in court defending Americans' healthcare that President Trump seeks to strip from them, "" he added. Barr's comments on Wednesday came after he faced a similar grilling from members of the House Appropriations Committee Tuesday on the new decision. At one point during the hearing, he told Rep. Matt Cartwright, a Pennsylvania Democrat, that concerned lawmakers should ""let the courts do their job."" Mulvaney said over the weekend that the White House could introduce a proposal ""fairly shortly."""

Trump-appointed energy official: Climate change is real and we must lower carbon emissions - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Matt Egan,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/business/climate-change-chatterjee-coal-renewable-energy/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) A top federal energy regulator appointed by President Donald Trump is calling for urgent action to address climate change.
Wednesday's comments by Neil Chatterjee mark a striking contrast with Trump, who has voiced skepticism about climate change and recently suggested wind power causes cancer ‚Äî despite no evidence to support that. ""I believe climate change is real. I believe man has an impact,"" Chatterjee, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said at a conference in New York. ""And I believe that we need to take steps to mitigate emissions urgently."" Chatterjee noted that he is a Republican from Kentucky who worked for Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and was appointed to FERC in May 2017 by Trump . FERC is an independent agency that is run by bipartisan commissioners. Speaking at the Columbia Global Energy Summit, Chatterjee applauded the rising popularity of cleaner energy such as natural gas as well as wind and solar. Read More ""We've been encouraged and excited to see the increased deployment of renewables,"" Chatterjee told reporters. Power emissions drop Natural gas recently surpassed coal as America's leading fuel source, while wind and solar are expected to be the fastest-growing source of US electricity generation for at least the next two years. Chatterjee cheered the fact that US power sector carbon emissions have plunged to multi-decade lows . ""That's largely being driven, not by regulations, but by market forces. By consumer choices,"" he said. That decline in carbon emissions has been caused by power plants switching away from coal in favor of cleaner alternatives. Neil Chatterjee, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said he has ""deep, deep sympathy"" for coal industries that have been hurt by the shift toward cleaner energy. Trump promised during the 2016 campaign to revive the downtrodden American coal industry, which has been slammed by the abundance of cheap natural gas. More recently, coal has faced competition from the plunging cost of solar and wind energy. Those trends have continued, if not accelerated, under Trump despite his administration's efforts to slash environmental regulations. 'Devastating' impact on coal country Chatterjee voiced concern about the demise of coal jobs, but stressed FERC does not have the legal authority to address this problem. ""I have deep, deep sympathy for the plight of coal communities,"" Chatterjee said. ""I'm from Kentucky. I've seen firsthand what happens when the plants shut down and the mines shut down."" The FERC chairman said that many coal regions lack viable alternatives for employment, creating a cascading effect when mines go out of business. ""Homes lose value because people won't move to an area without hope for economic prosperity. That's really devastating,"" Chatterjee said. But he said FERC only has the power to ""call balls and strikes"" based on its statutory authority, not the struggles of coal communities. Wind power doesn't cause cancer. It creates jobs, Jay Inslee says ""It is up to Congress and state governors to address those issues,"" Chatterjee said. In early 2018, FERC unanimously rejected the Trump administration's rescue plan for the crumbling coal industry. Chatterjee joined four other FERC commissioners in dismissing Energy Secretary Rick Perry's proposal to subsidize power plants like coal and nuclear that maintain a 90-day supply of fuel on site. But Chatterjee said Wednesday he's ""very concerned"" about the loss of nuclear power, the leading carbon-free source of electricity in the United States. And he noted that the increased use of renewables can cause intermittency issues when solar and wind power isn't as strong. Leading academics speaking at the Columbia conference agreed with Chatterjee's assessment of climate change as a serious threat. ""99% of the scientific community is totally convinced about climate change,"" said Alex Halliday, director of Columbia University's The Earth Institute. ""It's unambiguous as far as scientists are concerned."""

Conley, 77, died Wednesday in Nashville where he had been in hospice care, his brother, Fred, told CNN. ""We are heartbroken,"" Carol Scates, Conley's life partner of 20 years, said. ""The light has dimmed but his light will shine on in his music."" Conley topped the charts in the 1980s with hit songs including ""Holding Her and Loving You,"" ""What I'd Say"" and ""Right From the Start."" In 2017, Earl Thomas Conley performs at the Nashville Songwriters Hall Of Fame Awards. Scates told CNN that Conley's creative talents transcended music. Read More ""A lot of people don't realize he was not just an artist who performed music, but he was a very talented artist who painted and sculpted,"" she said. Conley was born in Portsmouth, Ohio, in 1941 and was the third of eight children. ""He could create anything with his hands,"" Scates told CNN. ""When he was a little boy, they didn't have toys. He carved the toys they played when he was little."" He was rejected from art school so decided to join the Army instead, according to his biography on allmusic.com. In 1968, he was honorably discharged and started pursuing his music career by playing at night clubs in Nashville. Throughout his career, he released 10 albums and had more than 30 songs on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart. Fellow country artists shared tributes of Conley on social media.

The New York AG's first 100 days of war against Trump - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Sonia Moghe,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/letitia-tish-james-new-york-attorney-general-trump/index.html,"New York (CNN) Letitia ""Tish"" James assumed her post as New York's attorney general 100 days ago on the heels of a campaign that vowed to investigate President Donald Trump and his business dealings.
So far, her office has subpoenaed two banks for records related to Trump Organization projects and has continued to pursue a lawsuit against the Trump Foundation , alleging it violated state and federal charities law. Asked by CNN about the lawsuit, Donald Trump Jr. dismissed it, saying there was ""nothing to talk about -- more nonsense."" She's even pushed for the state assembly to pass legislation that would allow her office to pursue state charges for anyone the President pardons on federal charges. Her office has also taken on issues affecting the entire nation, at times directly hitting the Trump administration's policies. James' office will head to the Supreme Court to argue a case against the Trump administration's attempt to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. Her office also joined a coalition of states in filing a motion to block the construction of a border wall. And there's the suit, filed in July 2018, challenging a Department of Labor rule that would allow small businesses to get around the Affordable Care Act by offering limited health plans. Her office's pursuit of tax records and details of President Trump's businesses, along with efforts by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, could be critical leading into the re-election campaign as the Mueller investigation has ended and House Democrats are only now accelerating their investigations. Read More James is the first black woman to be elected to a statewide office in New York and the first female state attorney general. Her campaign was partially based on a platform of investigating Trump. It's deadline day for Trump's tax returns ""I will never be afraid to challenge this illegitimate President,"" James said during her campaign. ""Most of his business activities are performed in New York,"" James told MSNBC earlier this month. ""He engages in business in New York. He operates in New York. And it's really critically important that New Yorkers, and as taxpayers ... that we understand and know whether or not he devalued his corporations and he received some tax benefits thereof. That he engaged in false claims against New Yorkers and as a result of that we are seeking to see what we can do legally."" Trump himself has weighed in, tweeting in December that James ""openly campaigned on a GET TRUMP agenda,"" adding that he feels he ""will never be treated fairly by these people."" ....In any event, it goes on and on & the new AG, who is now being replaced by yet another AG (who openly campaigned on a GET TRUMP agenda), does little else but rant, rave & politic against me. Will never be treated fairly by these people - a total double standard of ""justice.""
‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2018 Meanwhile, the office is also involved in a sweeping lawsuit filed in March against opioid manufacturers and members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin. 'Dispassionately follow the facts' At first, James' comments concerned some of those who had worked in the attorney general's office, including former director of communications and senior counsel for policy Eric Soufer. ""I think people didn't quite know what to make of it -- they weren't sure if it was the tip of the iceberg or if it was just sort of routine political rhetoric,"" Soufer said. ""But I think what we've seen in the first 100 days since Tish has taken office is that they've really put their heads down and gotten to work on advancing cases and investigations that were already in progress and launching some new really important affirmative litigation against the Trump Administration."" Republican strategist Evan Siegfried has not been a vocal critic of James but feels that positions including state attorneys general should function above the political fray. ""Any person running for a law enforcement or judicial position should not be making political statements or statements targeted toward individuals or organizations,"" Siegfried said. ""While it might be good for charging up the electorate, it certainly is not good for a legitimate action to be taken in court."" But Siegfried believes that James' rhetoric has changed. ""Her statements, while still political, are couched more in the fashion of a lawyer,"" Siegfried said. CNN asked James' office if she has decided to take a more muted political tone during her first months in office. She responded with a written statement. ""The facts are what they are, and in court, facts and the law are what matter most,"" James said in a statement to CNN. ""We are diligent in our work and dispassionately follow the facts to wherever they lead us. There is nothing partisan about that."" James' comments have already been cited in one case that her office is working on. Attorneys for the Trump Foundation accused the New York Attorney General's Office of political motivation in filing a suit against the foundation. ""Newly elected New York Attorney General Letitia James ran on an anti-Trump campaign where she expressed grave antipathy and animus toward Mr. Trump,"" attorneys for the foundation, as well as Trump and his three eldest children wrote in the filing . The suit was filed in June 2018 and James took office in January 2019. Attorneys for the Trump Foundation previously filed a motion to dismiss the suit citing political bias, which was denied by a judge in November. An office with 'vast powers' As James focuses on pending cases, making sure she has the right staff in place will continue to be a priority. The end of 2018 saw several high-level exits from the office, but a spokeswoman for the office says all high-level, executive positions have been filled. Former federal prosecutor Duncan Levin said he believes James is tackling the types of issues that her constituents elected her to look into from her new powerful post, not the least of which are the Trump Foundation and the Trump family itself. ""The Attorney General's Office is one with vast powers,"" Levin said. ""While its criminal powers are somewhat limited, it does have original jurisdiction over money laundering offenses and that gives her real muscle."" Former staffers emphasized the importance of bringing in talent with federal prosecution experience. Soufer said it's become more important for the New York's attorney general's office to have a team with federal experience it can lean on when questions come up about whether federal policies can be challenged. ""When Trump announces heinous policies, a lot of people in the office have an instinctual reaction to it -- a negative reaction,"" Soufer said. ""But there's only a handful of people who can actually draw a map from how you can go from being repulsed by it to actually overturning it in the court system."""
"Defense Department charged $300,000 at Trump properties since 2017 - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Curt Devine,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/defense-department-300000-at-trump-properties/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Defense Department personnel have charged more than $300,000 at Trump-branded properties since the start of Donald Trump's presidency through last November, according to internal agency documents obtained by CNN.
The transactions range from lodging expenses at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, to restaurant tabs at the Trump International Hotel in Washington to parking fees at the Trump National Doral Golf Club in Miami. While all modern US presidents have traveled with military aides, the number of properties owned by Trump's company earning money from taxpayer dollars have led some government watchdogs to argue the arrangement breaches ethical norms and potentially violates a clause of the US Constitution. Critics say Trump's businesses should not profit from government money while he is in the White House. The documents show defense personnel charged about $173,000 at Trump properties on their travel cards between October 2017 and November 2018. This adds to the roughly $138,000-worth of charges on Defense Department Visa cards at Trump properties between January 2017 and August 2017, as CNN previously reported . The documents covering October 2017 through November 2018, obtained by CNN through a Freedom of Information Act request, do not specify which Pentagon employees incurred the expenses or the reason they traveled to those properties. Read More CNN's original request sought records from the Office of the Secretary of Defense and its joint staff related to expenses at Trump properties, including Trump's golf courses, his branded hotels and the Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. A spokesperson for the Trump Organization said in a statement to CNN, ""The Trump Organization does not profit whatsoever from any government officials staying at our properties. The rates we charge for government personnel are on an 'at cost' basis. There is no profit made by the Trump Organization."" Zhang hearing exposes Secret Service weaknesses at Mar-a-Lago The Defense Department declined to respond to CNN's questions about the charges and deferred to the White House Military Office, which also did not respond. Some of the transactions appear to overlap with Trump's travel. For example, between May and November of 2018, Defense Department officials charged nearly $79,000 to travel cards for accommodation costs at Trump's Bedminster club. Trump spent more than 20 days at the Bedminster club during that time, in which he hosted fundraisers and dined with supporters. He has insisted that such stays do not amount to vacations, though he has been photographed golfing. The documents do not specify the exact dates or room rates defense personnel were charged for those stays. The reason for other expenses is less clear. The travel-card records show 31 charges totaling about $1,600 under the category ""restaurants"" at the Trump International Hotel in Washington between November 2017 and November 2018. The details of those charges, and whether any could involve BLT Prime, a steakhouse located in the hotel but not owned by the Trump Organization, are also unclear in the documents. Other expenses include about $46,000 at the Trump International Hotel in New York in January 2018 and $287 for lodging costs at Trump's property in Doonbeg, Ireland, in October 2017. Because Trump transferred his business holdings into a trust while he serves as President but did not divest his assets, he stands to accrue profits from those holdings when he leaves office. The Defense Department expenses add to payments from other government agencies at Trump Properties. CNN previously reported that the US Secret Service paid Mar-a-Lago $63,700 between about February and April of 2017. Separately, a document obtained by the transparency group called Property of the People shows Mar-a-Lago in 2017 billed the Coast Guard $1,092 for a two-night stay at the rack rate, an industry term that usually suggests it is the non-discounted price for a hotel room. Walter Shaub, a former head of the Office of Government Ethics and frequent critic of Trump, argues the President should stop ""vacationing"" at his own properties to avoid the appearance that he seeks to profit from his presidency. Shaub also told CNN other government officials should know better than to spend taxpayer money at Trump properties if they can avoid it. ""You see charges like this and wonder, is part of his motivation to travel to his own properties that the government will spend money that will be funneled back to him?"" Shaub asked. ""He has not separated his business life from his government responsibilities but actually seems to seek opportunities to merge the two."" A lawsuit filed by the attorneys general of the District of Columbia and Maryland, both Democrats, claims Trump has violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution that bans gifts from foreign and domestic governments since he maintains a stake in the Trump International Hotel in Washington. According to court documents, the Trump administration argues that the lawsuit is causing the President harm and would interfere with the separation of powers. In March, three federal appeals court judges in Virginia indicated at a hearing they were skeptical of the suit, and one judge asked whether the suit was politically motivated. Those judges have not yet ruled on whether the suit can move forward. Attorneys for the Justice Department argued in the hearing that the president can't be sued while in office. Separate from that lawsuit, Trump's personal attorney Sheri Dillon argued before Trump's inauguration that a government payment for something like a hotel bill does not qualify as an emolument because ""it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange; not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument."" Trump isn't the only White House official to have owned properties that received payments from government agencies while in office. Federal contracting data show the Secret Service paid about $170,000 to rent former Vice President Joe Biden's property in Wilmington, Delaware, between 2011 and 2017. A spokesperson for Biden did not respond to requests for comment."

The No Ban Act, introduced by Sen. Chris Coons in the Senate and Rep. Judy Chu in the House, aims to repeal all three versions of the travel ban enacted by the Trump administration, amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion, and limit the power of presidents to institute such bans in the future. ""Right now, there are thousands of American citizens who are forced to live apart from their spouses, whose children will never know their grandparents, and who are denied the opportunity to celebrate milestones with loved ones because of the President's discriminatory Muslim ban that does not make us safer,"" Coons said in a news release. ""This ban is family separation by another name. It is a stain on America's reputation around the world that runs counter to our values and is hurting real people."" Since taking office, Trump has signed three executive orders creating some form of travel ban primarily targeting Muslim countries. The first two versions were blocked in court, but the third version, which placed varying levels of restrictions on foreign nationals from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Somalia and Yemen, was upheld by the Supreme Court last year. The law sparked the rejection of more than 37,000 visa applications in 2018. Read More Although the No Ban Act has little chance of gaining approval by the GOP-controlled Senate, it has been sponsored by 32 Democrats in the Senate and 63 in the House.

Omar -- who is from Somalia, one of the countries subject to restrictions in the current ban -- choked up as she spoke about the President's ""hateful efforts."" ""I believe this ban will go down in history as a moral stain on our country's history,"" Omar said. ""I believed even as a child in the promise of liberty, equality and justice that was the promise of the United States of America. Twenty years later, it seems those fundamental ideals are in peril."" ""I think about the little Ilhans who, like me, would also like to experience the American dream. They will no longer be able to fulfill that promise,"" the Minnesota Democrat said. The House Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on the bill in June."

Facebook is trying to limit the reach of misinformation,edition.cnn.com,Kaya Yurieff,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/tech/facebook-integrity-updates/index.html," Facebook is doing a lot of little things to try to address its bigger problems.
On Wednesday, the company announced more than a dozen updates about how it is addressing misinformation and other problematic content on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. To promote the various efforts, the company held a four-hour long event at its Menlo Park headquarters for around 20 reporters where employees for various Facebook products recapped changes and answered questions. For years, Facebook has grappled with the spread of controversial content on its platform, such as misinformation about elections, anti-vaccination stories, violence and hate speech. Facebook has been trying to remove things faster that are against its rules, and ""reduce"" the spread of content that doesn't explicitly violate its policies, but is still troublesome, such as clickbait and misinformation. ""We don't remove information from Facebook just because it's false. We believe we have to strike a balance,"" Facebook's VP of integrity Guy Rosen said at the event. ""When it comes to false information by real people, we aim to reduce distribution and provide context."" Read More For example, Facebook said it will lessen the reach of groups that often share misinformation. When users in a group frequently share content that has been deemed false by Facebook's third-party fact checkers, that group's content will be pushed lower in News Feed so fewer people see it. There will also be a ""click-gap"" signal, which will affect a link's position in the News Feed. With this feature, Facebook hopes to reduce the spread of websites that are disproportionately popular on Facebook compared to other parts of the web. It is working with experts to identify new ways to combat fake news on the platform. The Associated Press is expanding the work it does for Facebook's independent fact-checking program, too. The company has frequently described its issues with problematic content as ""adversarial."" In the company's framing, it is fighting an enemy that learns and changes tactics. The bundle of changes it announced on Wednesday are its newest weapons. Facebook policy bans content that it determines can result in ""imminent physical violence."" Employees on Wednesday defended its decision to not ban all misinformation or anti-vaccination content on its products. ""When it comes to thinking about harm, it is really hard ... to draw a line between a piece of content and something that happens to people offline,"" said Tessa Lyons, Facebook's head of News Feed integrity. She said some of the posts that appeared to be anti-vaccination involved people asking questions, seeking information and having conversations around the topic. Facebook and Google will face Congress over white nationalism ""There is a tension between enabling expression and discourse and conversation, and ensuring that people are seeing authentic and accurate information. We don't think that one private company should be making decisions about what information can or cannot be shared online,"" she said. Renee Murphy, principal analyst at research firm Forrester who covers security and risk, said that while Facebook's steps are positive, they don't do nearly enough to address some of its larger problems. ""Part of me says 'awesome [this content] wont go as far as it used to,"" she said. ""The other part says 'I have no trust in any of this.' At the end of the day, what is any of this going to do? How will they manage it?"" Facebook is also trying to be more transparent with users about how and why it makes decisions. As part of the effort, the company is adding a new section to its Community Standards website where users can see the updates Facebook makes to its policies every month. Another update lets users remove comments and other content they posted to a Facebook Group after they leave it. Hundreds of millions of Facebook records exposed on Amazon cloud servers Meanwhile, Facebook-owned Instagram is trying to squash the spread of inappropriate posts that don't violate its policies. For example, a sexually suggestive photo would still pop up in a feed if a user follows that account, but it may no longer be recommended for the Explore Page or in pages for hashtags. Facebook also announced a few updates to its chat service Messenger, including a Facebook verified badge that would show up in chats to help fight scammers who impersonate public figures. Another tool called the Forward Indicator will pop up in Messenger when a message is forwarded by the sender. WhatsApp, another Facebook-owned app, has a similar function, which is part of an effort to stop the spread of misinformation. WhatsApp has had major issues with viral hoax messages spreading on the platform, which have resulted in more than a dozen lynchings in India. Forrester's Murphy believes the company should do more to address major issues such as violence being livestreamed and going viral on the platform. Last month, a suspected terrorist was able to stream live video to Facebook of a mass murder in New Zealand. The company said its AI systems failed to catch the video, and it took down 1.5 million videos of the attack in the first 24 hours. ""They have bigger problems. I'm sure [these updates] will help sometimes, but there are bigger problems at foot,"" she said. ""Facebook has a lot more to do."""
"Senators, irritated by evasions, rap Mike Pompeo for 'silence with a dash of obfuscation' - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Nicole Gaouette,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/pompeo-senate-hearing-silence/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Senators rapped Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Wednesday for being less than forthcoming on a series of issues, as the top US diplomat sidestepped questions on Washington's support for a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians, the Saudi killing of Jamal Khashoggi and why Washington is treating Mexico like an ""enemy of the United States.""
One lawmaker described the top US diplomat's approach to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as ""silence with a dash of obfuscation,"" as senators on both sides of the aisle expressed frustration. Republicans and Democrats started by pressing Pompeo on the State Department's failure to disclose information on ""an important issue"" they couldn't even name in public. Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, said the committee wouldn't have learned about the issue ""that had not previously been shared with us, would not in fact have been shared had we not raised it with you"" in a classified briefing. The disclosure ""may have made the difference in how Senators voted on a particular matter,"" added Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the committee. 'A closer bond' Read More ""That's simply unacceptable,"" Menendez said during a hearing on the agency's budget. ""If this committee is to be able to function -- if Congress is to play its constitutionally-mandated role -- your department needs to do a better job of engaging with us, briefing us and responding to our requests."" Committee chairman James Risch, an Idaho Republican, echoed the charge in gentler fashion. ""Senator Menendez is correct that there are items we need a closer bond on,"" he said. Pompeo didn't engage on the mystery issue, but it set the tone for a hearing in which senators repeatedly pushed him to clarify the administration's policies and questioned his refusal to respond clearly on issues ranging from Afghanistan to Iran and human rights. The top US diplomat refused to answer direct questions from Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, on whether the administration still upholds the principle of a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. ""I'm kind of shocked that cannot be stated clearly,"" Kaine said. 'Only Congress can declare war' The day before, Pompeo had refused to tell Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen whether the US would oppose the plan Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposed to unilaterally annex all or parts of the West Bank. Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, asked if Pompeo thought the 2001 authorization to go to war with those who attacked the US on September 11 applies to Iran or its Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the administration will designate as a foreign terrorist organization starting April 15th. ""I'd prefer to just leave that to lawyers,"" Pompeo said. ""I am troubled that the administration can't unequivocally say that you haven't been given power"" to go to war with Iran, Paul said. ""If you want a war in Iran, you have to come to us,"" Paul said. ""Only Congress can declare war,"" he said. ""You do not have our permission to go to war in Iran, and that should be very explicit."" Sen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat, asked whether the Trump administration had reached an agreement with Pyongyang on ""what the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would look like."" 'I can't answer' ""I can't answer that question yes or no,"" Pompeo said. ""We've had extensive conversations with the North Koreans about what the full, final denuclearization as verified by the international community would ultimately look like. It would look like the fully denuclearized North Korea. That's what it would look like."" Democratic Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts announced that he, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and Kaine will introduce legislation to mandate that the administration disclose authorizations for the sharing of sensitive nuclear power information. The Trump administration has riled lawmakers by not disclosing information about transfers to Saudi Arabia . ""There's a bipartisan concern on this committee that we don't have enough information about these potential nuclear deals between the United States and Saudi Arabia in an already volatile area of the world,"" Markey said, describing the administration's approach on the matter as ""silence with a dash of obfuscation."" 'A complicated question' Sen. Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico, described a US southern border that looks like ""a war zone,"" with the military present. ""This is reminiscent of how enemies treat one another,"" Udall said. ""Is Mexico the enemy of the United States?"" Instead of offering a ""yes"" or a ""no,"" Pompeo told Udall that ""this is a real crisis."" While the Mexican foreign minister has been ""a great partner,"" the flow of migrants hasn't stopped. Sen. Cory Gardner, the Colorado Republican who chairs the chairs the Subcommittee on East Asia, asked if the US would ever consider legitimizing a leader to follow the current Dalai Lama if that person was chosen by China, which has worked to repress Tibetans and vilify their leader. The Dalai Lama, 83, was hospitalized in India Wednesday. ""I hope the answer is no,"" Gardner said, after Pompeo hesitated. ""It's a complicated question,"" Pompeo said. Uyghur crackdown in Xinjiang doubles security spending in one year The top US diplomat similarly refused to pledge to go beyond rhetoric and use sanctions to punish China for its massive detention camps used to hold and indoctrinate Uyghur Muslims -- including some US residents reportedly being held there. And he wouldn't commit when New Hampshire's Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen asked if the US would pressure Afghanistan to let women be part of talks on any peace settlement with the Taliban. Previous Republican administrations had championed the cause of Afghan women who were brutally repressed under the Taliban. ""What I am asking is that we put pressure on the Afghan government and the Taliban to ensure that women are part of the negotiations,"" Shaheen said, adding later that ""it doesn't sound to me like you're willing to commit to that though."" Pompeo said he hoped Afghan women would raise the issue with their government. ""We want every woman's voice to be heard,"" he said. ""I hope they'll all do that."" 'Shall is shall' At one point, Menendez told Pompeo that the administration's refusal to offer a straight answer amounts to a violation of the law. He pointed to a requirement under the Global Magnitsky Act that the administration determine whether Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is responsible for Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi's premediated murder. ""You're still not in compliance with the law,"" Menendez said. ""Nor has the administration provided a justification for its lack of respect for the law."" When Pompeo declared that he was confident they are complying with the law, Menendez interrupted him to read the law which declares the President ""shall"" submit a report to Congress within 120 days. ""The president shall, shall,"" stressed Menendez. ""Not may, not could. He shall determine .... shall is shall. It means you must and yet you refuse to give us -- even if you if your determination is that he hasn't. But you refused to give us a determination."" The message that sends globally, Menendez said, is that ""you can do anything with impunity just because you have some sort of strategic interest with the United States."""
Betsy DeVos takes heat from House Democrats over school choice - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Katie Lobosco,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/betsy-devos-school-choice-congress/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Democrats took aim at Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ' proposed school choice tax credit at a House Education and Labor hearing Wednesday, arguing that it could siphon away funds from public schools.
DeVos said the program, known as Education Freedom Scholarships, ""won't take a single dollar from local public schools, school teachers or public school students."" But several Democratic members of the committee disputed her claim, arguing that the scholarship program would end up harming public schools. In a testy exchange, Ohio Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge started by suggesting that DeVos isn't looking out for all students, calling the program a ""shell game"" that benefits some children at the expense of those in the public school system. ""Do you realize it is your responsibility to educate every child in the United States,"" she asked. Read More DeVos declined to provide a yes or no answer. ""It's my responsibility to be the Secretary of Education,"" she began before Fudge interrupted. ""You're really good at evading. That's a really simple question,"" Fudge said. Half the women are gone from Trump's Cabinet DeVos has long been a proponent of school choice policies. She and her husband opened a charter school of their own and spent millions of dollars over the years to lobby for big changes to Michigan schools, among other issues. As proposed, people who make voluntary donations to the scholarship fund would receive a dollar-for-dollar federal tax credit. Students would be allowed to use the money to go to a private or public school, including charters, outside their local district. The department is asking the Treasury to appropriate up to $5 billion a year for the new program. That money doesn't come from the Education Department's budget because it would instead be used to pay for the tax credit. But Oregon Democratic Rep. Suzanne Bonamici argued that it still amounts to taking $5 billion from taxpayers that could be used for something else, like Pell Grants awarded to low-income college students. ""It is public money if it is $5 billion less in revenue,"" she said. DeVos also took heat Wednesday for not processing any loan forgiveness claims under the Borrower Defense to Repayment rule, after a court ordered her to implement the regulation in October. More than 158,000 people , many of whom attended for-profit colleges, are waiting to hear whether their debt will be canceled. When pressed by California Democratic Rep. Mark Takano, DeVos confirmed that no claims had been approved or denied since the court order. ""It is true none have been approved in last several months,"" she said. Under DeVos, the Department of Education delayed implementation of the Obama-era rule that allows people to apply for loan forgiveness if they believe their school defrauded them. If a school misled a student about whether their program was accredited, or how likely they would be to get a job after finishing, a student might be eligible for relief. The department stopped processing the Borrower Defense claims after it was sued by Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and Washington, DC, over the delay. The court sided with the group last year. States say DeVos is hurting efforts to police student loan servicers At a Senate hearing two weeks ago , DeVos said she did not know how many claims had been processed since the court ordered implementation of the rule -- though she said that the department is ""reviewing them regularly."" Meanwhile, the department moved forward with granting automatic loan forgiveness claims to those whose schools closed while they were enrolled. Under the rule, those students don't have to submit documents proving they were defrauded. On Wednesday, DeVos said that 16,519 of those claims have been granted since the court ruling. But Takano questioned why those claims had been prioritized over those from students who are arguing their schools defrauded them but hadn't closed. When a school closes, taxpayers are on the hook for the outstanding federal student loan, while the school is on the hook if it committed wrongdoing but remains open. ""Knowing this, a reasonable and prudent person, might pause at the idea that the department may have the perverse incentive to intentionally delay implementation of the Borrower Defense rule to protect the financial interests of these for-profit institutions and their investors,"" he said. When asked if she or her aides directed staff to cherry pick claims, DeVos said the department was focused on addressing all of the loan forgiveness claims. ""I am very troubled by your non-answers today. Madam secretary, there is no freedom in a student being obligated to pay off a loan from a school that has defrauded them. It's an unjust burden,"" Takano said."
Katie Bouman: How a grad student at MIT made the first black hole image possible - CNN,www.cnn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/katie-bouman-mit-black-hole-algorithm-sci-trnd/index.html,"That image of a black hole you saw everywhere? Thank this grad student for making it possible By Michelle Lou and Saeed Ahmed, CNN Updated 11:46 PM EDT, Wed April 10, 2019
(CNN) Imagine trying to take a photo of an orange that's on the moon with your smartphone. It seems impossible.
That's what it was like for scientists trying to capture an image of a black hole in space. Despite the tall order, an international team of more than 200 researchers unveiled the first-ever image of a black hole on Wednesday.
The effort wouldn't have been possible without Katie Bouman, who developed a crucial algorithm that helped devise imaging methods.
Three years ago, Bouman led the creation of an algorithm that eventually helped capture this first-of-its-kind image: a supermassive black hole and its shadow at the center of a galaxy known as M87. She was then a graduate student in computer science and artificial intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Black holes are extremely far away and compact, so taking a photo of one is no easy task. In addition, black holes by definition are supposed to be invisible -- although they can give off a shadow whenthey interact with the material around them.
A global network of telescopes known as the Event Horizon Telescope project collected millions of gigabytes of data about M87 using a technique known as interferometry. However, there were still large gaps in the data that needed to be filled in. Her algorithm, and many others, helped fill in the gaps
That's where Bouman's algorithm -- along with several others -- came in. Using imaging algorithms like Bouman's, researchers created three scripted code pipelines to piece together the picture. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) -- a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration -- was designed to capture images of a black hole. Today, in coordinated press conferences across the globe, EHT researchers reveal that they have succeeded, unveiling the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow.
They took the ""sparse and noisy data"" that the telescopes spit out and tried to make an image. For the past few years, Bouman directed the verification of images and selection of imaging parameters.
""We developed ways to generate synthetic data and used different algorithms and tested blindly to see if we can recover an image,"" she told CNN.
""We didn't want to just develop one algorithm. We wanted to develop many different algorithms that all have different assumptions built into them. If all of them recover the same general structure, then that builds your confidence.""
The result? A groundbreaking image of a lopsided, ring-like structure that Albert Einstein predicted more than a century ago in his theory of general relativity. In fact, the researchers had generated several photos and they all looked the same. The image of the black hole presented on Wednesday was not from any one method, but all the images from different algorithms that were blurred together.
""No matter what we did, you would have to bend over backwards crazy to get something that wasn't this ring,"" Bouman said. Bouman was a crucial member of the imaging team
""(Bouman) was a major part of one of the imaging subteams,"" said Vincent Fish, a research scientist at MIT's Haystack Observatory.
""One of the insights Katie brought to our imaging group is that there are natural images,"" Fish said. ""Just think about the photos you take with your camera phone -- they have certain properties. ... If you know what one pixel is, you have a good guess as to what the pixel is next to it.""
For example, there are areas that are smoother and areas that have sharp boundaries. Astronomical images share these properties, and you can mathematically encode these properties, Fish said.
Junior members like Bouman made significant contributions to the project, he added. Of course, senior scientists worked on the project, but the imaging portion was mostly led by junior researchers, such as graduate students and post docs.
""No one of us could've done it alone,"" Bouman said. ""It came together because of lots of different people from many backgrounds.""
Bouman starts teaching as an assistant professor at California Institute of Technology in the fall. "
Golden State Killer suspect may face death penalty - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Theresa Waldrop and Cheri Mossburg, CNN",04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/golden-state-killer-suspect-death-penalty/index.html,"(CNN) Prosecutors in the case of suspected Golden State Killer Joseph James DeAngelo will seek the death penalty, they said in court Wednesday -- despite the governor's moratorium on executions.
Though Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in March preventing executions from being carried out in California, the order does not prevent death penalty sentences from being handed out. Alleged Golden State Killer charged with another murder, district attorney says DeAngelo is accused of killing more than a dozen people and of at least 50 rapes in 6 counties in California between 1976 and 1986. Four of the counties said they will ask for the death penalty if he's convicted. The charges against DeAngelo in two of the counties, Tulare and Contra Costa, are not eligible for the death penalty. ""We are absolutely thrilled with what has happened today,"" said Ron Harrington, brother of victim Keith Harrington who was killed in 1980. Cases like this, he said, are ""why we have the death penalty."" JUST WATCHED Tissue led to Golden State Killer case arrest Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

Read More Charges against DeAngelo include 13 counts of murder with special circumstances, including murder committed during the course of a burglary and rape, prosecutors have said. He's also charged with kidnapping to commit robbery. DeAngelo, a former police officer, Vietnam veteran and mechanic, wasn't arrested until almost a year ago, after DNA from a crime scene was matched to a relative registered on genealogy sites. Representing Sacramento County, Deputy DA Thienvu Ho said Wednesday that prosecutors will reevaluate their request for the death penalty if the defense provides mitigating evidence.

For almost three years, she has been taking care of her five younger siblings. She's been keeping them clothed, fed and going to school every day -- all without the help of a car. ""When they told me the car is for us, I remember thinking, 'They just took away all these worries and stresses.'"" she told CNN. ""It was such a big weight off my shoulder and will help so much.""

""I learned so much from my mom. I was like her sidekick. I learned what it meant to raise a family."" She moved with her siblings to Orange County, Florida, because their grandmother lived there.
