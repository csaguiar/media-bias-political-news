However it appears, at least for now, that he is trying with his opposition doing EVERYTHING in their power to deny him a political victory for re-election. And the media is aiding them. The GOPes are aiding them.
He is literally against everyone, and immigration is NOT his only focus!
So who are you going to vote for in 2020 to get things done? You think the Donkeys are going to let a pro-immigration law anyone get into the white house?
You're stuck with Trump. He HAS attempted numerous times to get his wall through. They are NEVER going to give it to him. So, he's taken the most forceful route. We might actually have some wall next year?!
And be real! He still has Schumer blocking half of his cabinet nominees. It's been three years man! They are NEVER going to let him get anything he wants. He has to fight for everything. NOT JUST IMMIGRATION!"
