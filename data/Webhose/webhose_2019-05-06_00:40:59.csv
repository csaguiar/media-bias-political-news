A similar error is to claim that entering a password has broader
testimonial significance because it is akin to translating the entire encrypted
contents from ciphertext to plaintext. On this thinking, entering the password
is like a witness taking the stand and translating documents from a secret
language into English. But this analogy doesn't work. Assuming that an act
of translation could be incriminating,68 and that the act of production doctrine
would apply to it, the testimonial aspect of translation is knowing how to
translate from one language to another. In contrast, entering a password
implies no such knowledge. Take the case of my sister's phone. If I enter the
password and the phone unlocks, my entering the password implies no
knowledge about how the phone's encryption software works. I don't even
know what kind of phone my sister has. The only testimony implicit in
unlocking her phone is the only thing I know: The password."

1st Living HIV-Positive Organ Donor Wants To Lift 'The Shroud Of HIV Related Stigma',www.gpb.org,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/1st-living-hiv-positive-organ-donor-wants-lift-shroud-hiv-related-stigma,"/
Nina Martinez just became the world's first living HIV-positive organ donor.
In a medical breakthrough, surgeons at Johns Hopkins Hospital late last month successfully transplanted one of her kidneys to a recipient who is also HIV positive.
""I feel wonderful,"" Martinez, 35, said in an interview with NPR's Michel Martin, 11 days into her recovery. The patient who received her kidney has chosen to remain anonymous, but is doing well, Martinez is told.
""They're doing wonderfully and they got an organ they desperately needed to get and that's all I could ask for,"" Martinez said.
HIV advocates are celebrating the achievement as an important step towards lifting the stigma around a disease that affects some 1.1 million Americans . In 2017, an estimated 18 patients died each day while waiting for an organ transplant. Many of these deaths involved HIV positive patients who have traditionally had access to a much smaller pool of potential organ donors. The decision to donate
Martinez contracted HIV through a blood transfusion when she was an infant in the early 1980s.
""I do think that my lack of discomfort in talking about HIV does make people more comfortable with the idea, and I do attribute that to being diagnosed at such a young age,"" she said. ""I didn't know HIV was supposed to be something that I was ashamed of.""
She said she first looked into becoming a donor last year, when Johns Hopkins became the first hospital in the United States to announce plans to perform organ transplants for HIV patients from donors who are HIV positive. Previously, doctors had only transplanted organs to HIV-positive recipients from deceased HIV donors.
""Like most living kidney donors, I did start this process for a friend that I knew who needed a kidney,"" said Martinez.
Then her friend died in November, when Martinez was in the middle of a rigorous evaluation process. ""I knew that this was a lot of medical spending not to try and do something with,"" she said. So Johns Hopkins found another recipient.
Explaining why she felt compelled to share her story, Martinez pointed to when Johns Hopkins performed the first transplants from deceased HIV-positive donors to two anonymous patients in 2016.
""It was important to me to be able to put a name and a face to that story to show that the need for HIV-positive organs is real and actually benefits everybody,"" she said. ""My taking somebody off the deceased donor waitlist who is HIV positive means that everyone moves up the waitlist whether they're HIV positive or not.""
Currently, more than 113,000 people in the U.S. — including those living with HIV — are waiting to receive an organ transplant, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). A years-long drive
Last month's surgery marked the culmination of a years-long drive to expand access to organ donors for patients with HIV.
In 2016, UNOS gave Johns Hopkins approval to carry out the first transplant from an HIV positive donor to an HIV positive patient, capping a two-year push by Martinez's surgeon, Dorry Segev, to legalize such procedures.
Before that, Segev, an associate professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, helped draft the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act signed by President Obama in 2013. The measure reversed a 1988 law preventing doctors from procuring HIV-infected organs regardless of the recipient's HIV status.
Segev, speaking with NPR in 2016 , said he was motivated to address the ""antiquated law"" when he saw that the need for organ transplants among HIV patients had swelled since the start of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s.
Segev said he grew frustrated as he watched potentially life-saving organs going to waste. In one 2011 study , he and his colleagues projected that an estimated 500 to 600 would-be organ donors with HIV die each year. Had they been allowed to donate while they were alive, they could have been saving more than 1,000 lives annually.
""We were throwing away organs that were infected with HIV that could be used to help people with HIV,"" Segev said.
Today, an HIV diagnosis is no longer the death sentence it once was. ""People live their lives with it,"" said Segev. ""They just need to take antiretroviral medication.""
But patients who use those antiretroviral treatments — along with other drugs used to treat the disease — are also at higher risks of kidney and liver failure and often end up on the organ waiting list. Keeping transplants safe
Given the risk of kidney disease that's associated with HIV, the medical community has until relatively recently considered it unsafe to leave a would-be donor with just one kidney.
But newer medications are thought to be both more effective and safer, and to guard against potential complications, Martinez was made to go through months of rigorous testing to ensure success for her and her recipient.
""They determined that my future risk of kidney disease was really, really, small,"" Martinez said.
Martinez hopes her visibility and openness about her disease encourages others to realize they can be a part of advanced new treatments that allow HIV-positive people to live a healthy life.
""I hope that people who are not living with HIV who wouldn't normally consider themselves to be potential living kidney donors would actually consider it in earnest, as well as people living with HIV who are on great treatment.""

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to hear now about a major medical milestone. For the first time, a person living with HIV has donated a kidney to someone who is also HIV-positive. The groundbreaking transplant was performed at the end of March at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, Md. Public health consultant Nina Martinez is the woman who donated her kidney, and she's decided to share her story with the public. She's with us now from member station WABE in Atlanta.
Nina Martinez, thank you so much for joining us.
NINA MARTINEZ: Thank you so much for having me.
MARTIN: And how are you feeling?
MARTINEZ: I feel wonderful. It's only been a short time since the transplant, and I give all that credit to the wonderful team at Johns Hopkins for caring for me so well.
MARTIN: The person who received your kidney chose to remain anonymous, but it's my understanding - if I have this right - that this person is not related to you. So I'm guessing that people might wonder why you were really motivated to become a donor.
MARTINEZ: Sure. Well, like most living kidney donors, I did start this process for a friend that I knew who needed a kidney. And I knew that donating as an HIV-positive person was legal, but I didn't know where we were with the science just yet. Unfortunately, my friend passed away last November and while I was in the middle of my evaluation at Johns Hopkins. And I knew that this was a lot of medical spending not to try and do something with, so I went ahead and proceeded to try and donate to someone anyway and to maximize the best transplant outcome. I did decide to let Johns Hopkins pick somebody who was on their wait list waiting for a kidney.
MARTIN: But I just want to go a little deeper here because I understand that this is actually a very kind of profound decision on your part - not just to donate the kidney but to be very public about it - to basically say, this is something I want to do. This is something I want people to know. Why is it so important?
MARTINEZ: It was important to me to identify myself because this is 2019, and I didn't want to hide under the shroud of HIV-related stigma. Now, everyone has their right to privacy, especially if you're trying to get over a recent kidney crisis, so I definitely respect my recipient's right to anonymity. But for myself, it was important to me to be able to put a name and a face to that story to show that the need for HIV-positive organs is real and actually benefits everybody, whether HIV-positive or not, because my taking somebody off the deceased donor wait list who is HIV-positive means that everyone moves up the waitlist whether they're HIV-positive or not.
MARTIN: So, Nina, help me out on this. As I understand it, there used to be a ban on people with HIV donating their organs. Isn't that right?
MARTINEZ: That's correct. In 1988, there was a ban on using the organs from donors living with HIV, either as deceased donors or living ones. And that all changed in 2013 when Congress passed the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act, allowing the transplantation of organs from donors living with HIV.
MARTIN: You've lived with HIV your entire conscious life - I mean, as I understand it, that you contracted HIV through blood transfusion when you were an infant in the early 1980s. So do you sense a change in how HIV has been viewed by the broader public and not just by the medical community? I mean, do you remember - I mean, I don't know that most of us kind of as kids think about becoming an organ donor, right?
MARTINEZ: (Laughter).
MARTIN: But do you remember feeling that the world of possibility has changed for you?
MARTINEZ: I do think in some places in America things definitely have changed with the science. In places, for example, where I live in the Deep South, there are a lot of long-held stigmatizing beliefs that people still have. And one of the reasons I did decide to go public as a resident of Atlanta was to really push people's perceptions into the 21st century because I couldn't think of any better way to show people that, you know, this isn't the 1980s anymore. You can live a long and healthy life living with HIV. People like me don't bring death, we can actually bring life.
MARTIN: Isn't it the case that, in the past, it isn't just the stigma, but the doctors were concerned that HIV-positive donors were too fragile to leave with just one kidney, that doctors were also concerned about the health of the donor? Would that be accurate?
MARTINEZ: That's correct. So usually, in any living kidney donation, you're undergoing an evaluation to see, are you healthy enough to lose an organ that you don't need to lose? And is your future risk of kidney disease small enough that you won't be affected later in life? Now, with HIV in particular, it is the case that both the virus and some of the medications used to treat it - usually the older medications - do cause some kidney damage that would be concerning. But, you know, time has changed, and we have newer medications that are kidney sparing. And so long as somebody has an undetectable viral load, they're seen to be a candidate for living donation.
MARTIN: So part of what I hear you saying is it's not just that people's perceptions have changed but that the reality of it is you are, in fact, healthy enough to be a donor. Have have people's perceptions changed? I mean, has your day-to-day life become different as a result of - I don't know - is it time? Is it education? Is it people knowing more? Is it your own outspokenness and confidence?
MARTINEZ: I do think that my lack of discomfort in talking about HIV does make people more comfortable with the idea. And I do attribute that to being diagnosed at such a young age. It was 1991. I didn't know HIV was supposed to be something that I was ashamed of. So I think that that really helps. And as far as how has my life changed so far, in the last 11 days it's changed a lot. Now people know my name. But it remains to be seen. I hope that people who are not living with HIV who wouldn't normally consider themselves to be potential living kidney donors would actually consider it in earnest, as well as people living with HIV who are on a great treatment that keeps them healthy.
MARTIN: Do you happen to know how the recipient is doing? Did you get to meet him or her, and how is that person doing?
MARTINEZ: I do not know who the recipient is. They've elected to remain anonymous. And...
MARTIN: Even to you?
MARTINEZ: Yep. I completely respect it. I think that, in the future, if they change their mind about meeting me, that's perfectly fine. But this is a gift I gave freely. I do know that they're doing wonderfully. And they got an organ they desperately needed to get. And that's all I could ask for.

'There Is Clearly Something Happening': Fires Destroy 3 Black Churches In Louisiana,www.gpb.org,editor,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/there-clearly-something-happening-3-black-churches-are-set-fire-louisiana,"'There Is Clearly Something Happening': Fires Destroy 3 Black Churches In Louisiana By editor • 14 hours ago Originally published on April 7, 2019 2:43 am
Federal authorities have joined the investigation into a string of fires that engulfed three historically black churches in southern Louisiana in the span of just 10 days.
The fires began on March 26 in Louisiana's St. Landry Parish, a rural community north of Lafayette. Officials have not determined the cause of the fires, but have said they are unable to rule out the possibility of arson or that the three incidents were all related.
""There is clearly something happening in this community,"" State Fire Marshal H. Browning said in a statement on Thursday. ""That is why it is imperative that the citizens of this community be part of our effort to figure out what it is.""
The fires caused extensive damage to the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church and the Greater Union Baptist Church in the city of Opelousas, and the St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre. No deaths or injuries have been reported in either of the fires.
Separately, officials say a fourth fire was ""intentionally set"" on March 31 at the Vivian United Pentecostal Church, a predominately white church roughly three hours north in Caddo Parish.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is now investigating the fires, as is the FBI. So far officials have not connected the four fires, identified a suspect or determined a motive.
The narrow window in which the fires took place has raised fears that racist motivation may be at play. The fires have also rekindled painful memories of the violence that frequently targeted black churches in the South during reconstruction and the civil rights era. That violence has continued in recent years with incidents such as the 2015 shooting at the Emmanuel AME Baptist Church in Charleston, S.C., when a white supremacist fatally shot nine people.
For congregants like Florence Milburn, a member of the Greater Union Baptist Church, the fires have been devastating.
Milburn said she learned on Thursday about the fire at Greater Union.
""When I was notified at 2:30 in the morning, I was on my feet, and I was there,"" Milburn told NPR. ""My husband and I drove over there along with our other family members, and along with our church family, we were on site and we watched our church burn to the ground.""
The congregation of the Greater Union Baptist Church was preparing to celebrate the 130th anniversary of its construction this July. ""This is my family church. My family has been in this church for over 100 years, going back to my great grandparents, so when I heard of the fire, I was devastated. And I am still uneasy. I am still hurt,"" Milburn said.
Like others in the community, Milburn said there was ""something irregular, out of the ordinary"" about the fires. ""Something that should not have occurred.""
""Why they did it, what motive, we're at a loss. So whether or not we are told who did it, or why they did it, it doesn't bring our church back, and all the memories that we had,"" Milburn said. ""It's like losing a family member, or losing a family home.""
Milburn said that on Sunday morning, congregants will gather at a building loaned to them temporarily for worship. Plans for rebuilding have already begun, she said.
""We have to rebuild God's church."" Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to hear now about a major medical milestone. For the first time, a person living with HIV has donated a kidney to someone who is also HIV-positive. The groundbreaking transplant was performed at the end of March at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, Md. Public health consultant Nina Martinez is the woman who donated her kidney, and she's decided to share her story with the public. She's with us now from member station WABE in Atlanta.
Nina Martinez, thank you so much for joining us.
NINA MARTINEZ: Thank you so much for having me.
MARTIN: And how are you feeling?
MARTINEZ: I feel wonderful. It's only been a short time since the transplant, and I give all that credit to the wonderful team at Johns Hopkins for caring for me so well.
MARTIN: The person who received your kidney chose to remain anonymous, but it's my understanding - if I have this right - that this person is not related to you. So I'm guessing that people might wonder why you were really motivated to become a donor.
MARTINEZ: Sure. Well, like most living kidney donors, I did start this process for a friend that I knew who needed a kidney. And I knew that donating as an HIV-positive person was legal, but I didn't know where we were with the science just yet. Unfortunately, my friend passed away last November and while I was in the middle of my evaluation at Johns Hopkins. And I knew that this was a lot of medical spending not to try and do something with, so I went ahead and proceeded to try and donate to someone anyway and to maximize the best transplant outcome. I did decide to let Johns Hopkins pick somebody who was on their wait list waiting for a kidney.
MARTIN: But I just want to go a little deeper here because I understand that this is actually a very kind of profound decision on your part - not just to donate the kidney but to be very public about it - to basically say, this is something I want to do. This is something I want people to know. Why is it so important?
MARTINEZ: It was important to me to identify myself because this is 2019, and I didn't want to hide under the shroud of HIV-related stigma. Now, everyone has their right to privacy, especially if you're trying to get over a recent kidney crisis, so I definitely respect my recipient's right to anonymity. But for myself, it was important to me to be able to put a name and a face to that story to show that the need for HIV-positive organs is real and actually benefits everybody, whether HIV-positive or not, because my taking somebody off the deceased donor wait list who is HIV-positive means that everyone moves up the waitlist whether they're HIV-positive or not.
MARTIN: So, Nina, help me out on this. As I understand it, there used to be a ban on people with HIV donating their organs. Isn't that right?
MARTINEZ: That's correct. In 1988, there was a ban on using the organs from donors living with HIV, either as deceased donors or living ones. And that all changed in 2013 when Congress passed the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act, allowing the transplantation of organs from donors living with HIV.
MARTIN: You've lived with HIV your entire conscious life - I mean, as I understand it, that you contracted HIV through blood transfusion when you were an infant in the early 1980s. So do you sense a change in how HIV has been viewed by the broader public and not just by the medical community? I mean, do you remember - I mean, I don't know that most of us kind of as kids think about becoming an organ donor, right?
MARTINEZ: (Laughter).
MARTIN: But do you remember feeling that the world of possibility has changed for you?
MARTINEZ: I do think in some places in America things definitely have changed with the science. In places, for example, where I live in the Deep South, there are a lot of long-held stigmatizing beliefs that people still have. And one of the reasons I did decide to go public as a resident of Atlanta was to really push people's perceptions into the 21st century because I couldn't think of any better way to show people that, you know, this isn't the 1980s anymore. You can live a long and healthy life living with HIV. People like me don't bring death, we can actually bring life.
MARTIN: Isn't it the case that, in the past, it isn't just the stigma, but the doctors were concerned that HIV-positive donors were too fragile to leave with just one kidney, that doctors were also concerned about the health of the donor? Would that be accurate?
MARTINEZ: That's correct. So usually, in any living kidney donation, you're undergoing an evaluation to see, are you healthy enough to lose an organ that you don't need to lose? And is your future risk of kidney disease small enough that you won't be affected later in life? Now, with HIV in particular, it is the case that both the virus and some of the medications used to treat it - usually the older medications - do cause some kidney damage that would be concerning. But, you know, time has changed, and we have newer medications that are kidney sparing. And so long as somebody has an undetectable viral load, they're seen to be a candidate for living donation.
MARTIN: So part of what I hear you saying is it's not just that people's perceptions have changed but that the reality of it is you are, in fact, healthy enough to be a donor. Have have people's perceptions changed? I mean, has your day-to-day life become different as a result of - I don't know - is it time? Is it education? Is it people knowing more? Is it your own outspokenness and confidence?
MARTINEZ: I do think that my lack of discomfort in talking about HIV does make people more comfortable with the idea. And I do attribute that to being diagnosed at such a young age. It was 1991. I didn't know HIV was supposed to be something that I was ashamed of. So I think that that really helps. And as far as how has my life changed so far, in the last 11 days it's changed a lot. Now people know my name. But it remains to be seen. I hope that people who are not living with HIV who wouldn't normally consider themselves to be potential living kidney donors would actually consider it in earnest, as well as people living with HIV who are on a great treatment that keeps them healthy.
MARTIN: Do you happen to know how the recipient is doing? Did you get to meet him or her, and how is that person doing?
MARTINEZ: I do not know who the recipient is. They've elected to remain anonymous. And...
MARTIN: Even to you?
MARTINEZ: Yep. I completely respect it. I think that, in the future, if they change their mind about meeting me, that's perfectly fine. But this is a gift I gave freely. I do know that they're doing wonderfully. And they got an organ they desperately needed to get. And that's all I could ask for.
MARTIN: That was Nina Martinez last month. She became the world's first living HIV-positive organ donor. We reached her in Atlanta. Nina Martinez, thank you so much for talking to us.

Judge Apologizes For Freeing Migrant Who Then Killed 'Happy' Italian,www.breitbart.com,breitbart.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/04/07/judge-apologizes-freeing-migrant-who-then-killed-happy-italian/," Judge Apologises for Freeing Migrant Who Killed Italian for Being ‘Happy and White’ GIAN MATTIA D'ALBERTO/AFP/Getty Images CHRIS TOMLINSON 7 Apr 2019 The judge who freed confessed killer Said Mechaquat after an appeal has publicly apologised to the family of the Moroccan-born migrant’s victim, Stefano Leo. Judge Edmondo Barelli Innocenti, who is the president of the Court of Appeal in Turin, publicly apologised to Leo’s family, saying, “As a representative of the state I would like to apologise to the family of Stefano Leo,” but added, “I do not agree to say that the Court of Appeal is jointly responsible for the murder. We did what we had to do,” Il Giornale reports .
This “apology” comes after it was revealed that the Italian-Moroccan had been sentenced in June of 2016 to a year and six months in prison for aggravated assault on an ex-girlfriend.
At the time, another judge had denied him a suspended sentence in the case, referring to past crimes he had also committed. Despite this, the Court of Appeal later ruled that Said would not have to go to prison and serve his sentence and he was allowed to remain free.
“There was a problem. I can apologise, but there is no certainty that Mechaquat Said could still be imprisoned on February 23rd,” the judge added.
Migrant Admits to Killing Italian Man Because He Was ‘White, Happy’ https://t.co/KuwarjdRvz
 April 3, 2019
The Italian Ministry of Justice has launched a formal investigation into the matter to determine whether or not a judicial error was made in the case.
Said made headlines earlier this week after he turned himself in to police and admitted to stabbing Leo in the throat on the banks of the river Po, saying that he targetted him because he looked happy and he wanted to target a white Italian.
The killing is the latest to make headlines in Italy and follows the gruesome murder of Italian teen Pamela Mastropietro, who was allegedly murdered by a Nigerian drug dealer last year.
The trial of suspect Innocent Oseghale began earlier this year and horrific testimony from a man detained in prison with him claimed that Oseghale and another accomplice had begun dismembering 18-year-old Mastropietro while she was still alive .

SNL Cold Open: Jason Sudeikis returns as Joe Biden to attend a mandatory sensitivity training.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/snl-cold-open-jason-sudeikis-joe-biden-sensitivity-training-mckinnon-bryant-thompson-strong.html,"Yikes! NBC In what veteran political observers are calling “the worst news for Joe Biden’s presidential hopes since people figured out he was that Joe Biden ,” Saturday Night Live dedicated the entire cold open to the former Vice President’s habit of not respecting women’s personal space .That’s after a week in which Donald Trump did so many hilariously stupid things it required a bulleted list , from claiming that the noise from wind turbines causes cancer to telling the world he plans to nominate Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve Board . Maybe Alec Baldwin wasn’t available this week, maybe Kenan Thompson didn’t want to reprise his role as Cain , but whatever the extenuating circumstances, the writers at SNL looked at seven days’ worth of primo, Grade A American garbage and concluded that Joe Biden was not just ridiculous, but cold open ridiculous, so much so that they got Jason Sudeikis to come back to play him. I’m not saying that Saturday Night Live should be the only factor to consider when deciding how to vote in the Democratic primaries—I’m just saying I don’t remember the last time Elizabeth Warren was the subject of an entire SNL cold open: Sudeikis’ Biden is always funny, even in a not-great sketch, and although this is definitely a not-great sketch, it has a few flashes of the ol’ Biden magic. The ex-veep’s attempt to shimmy his way through sensitivity training to the strains of Lou Rawls’ “You’ll Never Find Another Love Like Mine” is gold, and of the two (!) sketches this week that included jokes about Leslie Jones sticking her fingers up someone’s butt, this was definitely funnier than the one set in a colorectal health clinic . But the best thing in the sketch seems to have been the work of someone in the art department rather than any of the cast members. Check out the photo on the wall: That’s the Joe Biden we know and love. NBC If Biden can convince that Saturday Night Live prop photo of Jason Sudeikis grinning like an idiot to campaign in his place, he’ll be the first president to win unanimously.

Pope calls for 'just and peaceful' solution to crisis in Venezuela,thehill.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/international/427170-pope-calls-for-just-and-peaceful-solution-to-crisis-in-venezuela,"Pope calls for 'just and peaceful' solution to crisis in Venezuela By Brett Samuels - 01/27/19 02:30 PM EST © Getty
Pope Francis on Sunday refused to say whether he supports opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's legitimate president, instead calling for a ""just and peaceful solution"" to the country's ongoing crisis.
The Associated Press reported that Francis addressed the situation in Venezuela during a stop in Panama for World Youth Day. The pope “asked the Lord to seek and find a just and peaceful solution to overcome the crisis that respects human rights and exclusively seeks the good of all people.”
While Francis has remained non-committal in the Venezuelan power struggle, many Venezuelan bishops have backed Guaidó. ADVERTISEMENT
The AP reported that leaders from across South and Central America attended Francis' remarks in Panama City.
The Trump administration last week recognized Guaidó , the head of Venezuela's National Assembly, as the country's interim president amid nationwide protests against Nicolás Maduro's government.
Numerous other nations followed suit, including Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Colombia.
The Trump administration has imposed numerous sanctions on Venezuelan businesses and those close to Maduro in recent months as the country's humanitarian and economic crises worsen. The U.S. and several other nations declared Maduro's recent re-election and subsequent inauguration illegitimate ."

Probes open into Hyundai and Kia fires,www.dailypolitical.com,Patrick Bannon,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailypolitical.com/2019/04/07/probes-open-into-hyundai-and-kia-fires.html,"Meridian Bancorp Inc (EBSB) Shares Bought by California Public Employees Retirement System Probes open into Hyundai and Kia fires April 7th, 2019 - Comments Off on Probes open into Hyundai and Kia fires - Filed Under - by Patrick Bannon
Even the U.S. government’s highway safety agency has decided to open two new investigations into fires involving Hyundai and Kia vehicles after getting complaints of more than 3,100 fires and 103 accidents.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it allowed a petition filed seeking the investigations. Get alerts:
The analyses, the other for Kia and one for Hyundai, cover non-crash fires in nearly 3 million vehicles from the automakers that are affiliated. The probes cover the 2011 through 2014 Kia Optima and Sorento, the 2011 through 2014 Hyundai Sonata and Santa Fe, and the 2010 through 2015 Kia Soul. The complaints came from data and from customers. One death was reported involving a Kia automobile, according to the files.
NHTSA had previously said it would incorporate the noncrash fires to some 2017 evaluation that analyzed remembers of Kia and Hyundai automobiles. It started the brand new probes”based on the bureau’s analysis of information received from several manufacturers, customer complaints and other sources.”
Jason Levine, executive director of the center, said in a statement that it is long past time to the bureau to investigate why so many Kia and Hyundai vehicles also have caught fire if not involved in crashes.
“While it may be six months post-due, we are gratified to watch NHTSA’s Office of Defect Investigations open formal investigations according to our petition,” Levine explained.
The facility contended that there are far more noncrash fires at the Hyundai and Kia cars and SUVs than in vehicles made with automakers.
Kia and hyundai said in statements that they’re working with the investigations and have been transparent and open with all NHTSA, providing information. Messages were left seeking comment from NHTSA.
In documents detailing the investigations, NHTSA reported it had received complaints of engine fires, as well as fires involving components such as tail light housings, wiring harnesses, and bulbs. Data requests were sent by agency investigators to both automakers in September and October of this past year, according to the documents.
The analysis will look into also the consequences that were safety-related and how frequently fires occur, how many vehicles have been influenced, the documents said.
Fire issues and engine failure with Hyundais and Kias have impacted more than 6 million vehicles according to NHTSA documents. Thus far, Hyundai and Kia have recalled about 2.4 million vehicles to fix problems which can lead to fires and motor failures.
Moreover, the automakers are doing a”product improvement campaign” covering the next 3.7 million vehicles to successfully set up applications that can alert drivers of possible engine failures and send the cars to some reduced-speed”limp” mode if problems are found.
Only last Friday, NHTSA announced a recall of approximately 20,000 Veloster cars with 1.6-liter engines at the U.S. and Canada because fuel can prematurely ignite in the cylinders throughout the pistons. That damage the motor, causing vehicles and in some cases catch fire and can cause stress.
But that is another problem from what has resulted in the rest of the recalls.
In February, Kia declared that it would remember the Soul SUV using all the same-size engine due to fire problems and engine failure, however for reasons unrelated to the issues of this Veloster.
Debris cut the flow of oil, inducing the connecting rod bearings to fail and can clog a vent. That could damage the engine block and cause oil to leak and also catch fire. The automakers also have announced remembers to inspect a gas pipe issue that can cause fires and leaks.
Levine has stated fire complaints to NHTSA have come from across the nation, involving a Kia Soul in April of 2017 including a death in Ohio. Kia says the driver in that incident by pushing on the gas and brake pedal at exactly the exact same time, inducing transmission fluid to flow and catch fire damaged the transmission. It’s not clear if this departure is the one cited in NHTSA’s figures.
Hyundai’s statement said it is monitoring the operation of its motors on the roads and many improvements have been made by it to its own engine manufacturing. The company also said it has made”significant efforts” to handle engine issues in some of its automobiles.
During a two-year interval commencing in November of 2016, Hyundai did fire-related reviews of 428 vehicles out of the approximately 8.7 million vehicles it has on the road today. The announcement says that for each 1 million Hyundai automobiles in the road, 49 had a fire through those 2 decades.
However, an insurance industry group, the Highway Loss Data Institute, discovered that fire insurance claims were registered by owners of five Hyundai and Kia cars and SUVs in a rate much higher than similar cars. The research found that some Hyundai and Kia vehicles with four-cylinder engines have at least double the noncrash fire claim speeds compared to the average of vehicles.
