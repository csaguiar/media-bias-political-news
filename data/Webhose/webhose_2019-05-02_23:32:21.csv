I moved from VA to NC in the summer between and NC taught state history in 7th and American History in 8th.

Hit the nail right in the head there, they control the media, and as cliche as it sounds, the minds of their constituents.
They'll continue to repeat their lies until either they're stopped by some huge bombshell that makes it absolutely impossible to continue repeating a lie without losing more of their brainwashed followers, or it becomes truth and they become vindicated, at which point it goes from repeating a lie, to downright persecution of the president and any of his supporters (and in the case of his supporters, likely violence against them).
Unfortunately though, they've managed to thoroughly embed themselves into the minds of every liberal or cuckservative over the past decade and a half that they're highly unlikely to lose more of their gullible base who believes everything their party leaders spoon-feed them. The ones you see leaving their party are the more clear-headed and less gullible liberals who have realized that they've been lied to.
The second won't happen because there was no collusion to begin with, so there's no huge bombshell for them to feel vindicated about. Though let's be honest here, either way this Russia bullshit ends, the liberals will riot and commit unprovoked violence against anyone publically showing support for the president or this country."

The President of the United States is not a dictator. These problems have been festering for decades and won’t be fixed in 2 years. I believe Trump has exposed both parties as unwilling to solve problems, even the tea party Freedom Caucus. They repeat talking points just like the left and do just enough to secure reelection. Any time Trump does something to actually enact lasting change and reform, or solve a problem, he is vehemently opposed by the radical left and his own party. The fact is, Trump is not a conservative, he’s a populist. The Republican Party was a vehicle for Trump. No one ever called Trump racist until he was a threat to power. His policies are not radical. They are opposed for personal hatred and the political class losing their power. Whether that is the border, health care, and even economic policy. A President has a limited amount of political capital and I’m sure his closest advisors helped establish his priorities for the first term, based on what has the best chance of success. McCain is solely responsible for the death of Obamacare repeal just because he personally hated Trump. These aren’t normal times. It’s actually remarkable the things this President has been able to do for the people despite never ceasing opposition from both political parties. Be smart. Would you like to sit out the 2020 election and ensure a Beto or Harris victory? Would that be an improvement? Now if Trump is re-elected in 2020 with a renewed mandate and replenished political capitol and he still doesn’t do anything about immigration, then this criticism is fair."
