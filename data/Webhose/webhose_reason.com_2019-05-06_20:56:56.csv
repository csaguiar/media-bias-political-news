A similar error is to claim that entering a password has broader
testimonial significance because it is akin to translating the entire encrypted
contents from ciphertext to plaintext. On this thinking, entering the password
is like a witness taking the stand and translating documents from a secret
language into English. But this analogy doesn't work. Assuming that an act
of translation could be incriminating,68 and that the act of production doctrine
would apply to it, the testimonial aspect of translation is knowing how to
translate from one language to another. In contrast, entering a password
implies no such knowledge. Take the case of my sister's phone. If I enter the
password and the phone unlocks, my entering the password implies no
knowledge about how the phone's encryption software works. I don't even
know what kind of phone my sister has. The only testimony implicit in
unlocking her phone is the only thing I know: The password."

Of course it'll pass. Bits and pieces, over time, eventually all adding up to the same thing. It's been going on for years. These things tend to accelerate. Graph taxation, state expenditure, regulatory control and notice how they start off at a low level and grow like a rolling snowball. Just imagine a green snowball. Ain't it pretty.
That ball has been rolling for quite some time now. Pretty soon it'll be hard to jump out of its way.
All over the world governments -- democratically elected governments -- in plain sight, as a result of long consultation processes, have implemented everything from carbon taxes to plastic bag bans. Most importantly, the Green agenda has been taught in all levels of education for at least a couple of decades. Children go on class trips for Earth Day and to protest climate change. It's official education policy and it's the default worldview of the millions of new voters being pumped out of the schools each and every year. This isn't a future event; this is now. It's a done deal; it just hasn't been voted on yet. But that's a minor detail. reply to this log in or register to reply TBlakely | 4.8.19 @ 2:24PM | #

I would like to try to pierce the informational bubble, most comments agree heavily with the author of the piece.. In doing so, I'm venturing out of my own usual bubble to try to read, consume and reciprocate with new information.
The author's underlining main conclusion, ""the green new deal is anti-democratic"" is based off of past perception and general cynical opinion from anything coming from the public sector in my opinion. I can tell you, that it isn't based on at least two things:
1) The green new deal policy proposal. I know this because there is no green new deal policy proposal.
2) The green new deal resolution that was introduced in congress. This was a resolution, its more like a vision statement, a set of principles, a guidance document, an outline of the scope and solutions they are working towards. All of the details are non-existent, and ""THE GREEN NEW DEAL"" is basically the brain-child of one organization. Whereas a general green new deal is any number of policy discussions and prescriptions that anyone that believes we should motivate as much US resources as possible to transition to a green economy might support. reply to this log in or register to reply Sevo | | #

The main idea put forth is that the advocates of the Green new deal will look to coercive govt policies in general. I admit that is absolutely an approach that some might take. But its actually completely the opposite of the actual text of the resolution that started this debate.
To realize that point, I want to encourage everyone to at least consume some information from the actual architects of the green new deal.
https://www.vox.com/ezra-klein-show-podcast
The episode entitled ""Meet the policy architect of the green new deal""
A huge portion of this conversation is explicitly about how the final polices she is developing have crucial democratic input, where she meets with all the stakeholders, the wonks, the impacted communities, the legislatures, the skeptics, etc. She explains how important it is to not create polices that harm the same communities that fossil fuel pollution and transitions disproportionately. Now this is an extremely complicated task, and we at this point have no idea how true any final plan will be to those goals. But the emphasis and care is there.
I read this reason article because I was in search of critics of a green new deal, a general idea that I am in much favor of. I am hoping you'll do the same. reply to this log in or register to reply Sevo | | #

It is clear that the Dems are only interested in minorities to the point of how much they can use them. You just have to look at places like Chicago to see how much Dems care about the Black population.
The Dems have divided America like it has never been since the civil war.
They have blacks against whites, Women against men, straights against gays and rich against poor.
The Dems are at such a point that it is unlikely that Bernie will win the nomination because he is straight, white old man so he does not tick any of the minority boxes. Even at this early stage it is becoming apparent that Harris is the nominee the MSM will be throwing their weight behind and Bernie will likely be cheated again.
It doesn't matter who the best candidate is, it just matters which candidate is in the most 'oppressed' groups
I can't stand Bernie and I hate Harris even more, but if Bernie is cheated again, the Dem party will rip apart. I am a Trump supporter, but certainly recognise the need for an opposition party in any democracy. A one-party state is very dangerous."

Altruism is as an evolutionary adaptation that arises in the natural world. There are a plethora of examples. If altruism didn't arise from the natural world by way of observable processes, its presence among homo sapiens would make an excellent argument for the existence of a God. How else to account for it?
Ultimately, the process we're talking about shouldn't be controversial to capitalists and probably wouldn't be among libertarians if it weren't for some clinging to the notions of Ayn Rand.

In case that was unclear, evolutionary processes are essentially market processes with specialization as a feature (as in ""specialization and exchange""). And we're not just talking about social adaptations if you imagine that's what altruism is about. Our neo-cortex evolved to leverage the advantages conferred by what you might think of as social adaptations, like language and religion."

The biggest obstacle keeping English colonists from pushing westward was the British crown. The colonists winning the American Revolution was probably the worst thing that could have happened to Native Americans. Wiping entire people's out and stealing their land has advantages.
It may be problematic, however, in maintaining whatever advantages societies get from genocidal theft without that cutting into the advantages of peaceful coexistence internally. Genocidal maniacs aren't typically good at respecting the rights of their people so that they can flourish."

Reparations Are More Likely to Divide the Nation Than Heal It Reason.com,reason.com,//,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/archives/2019/04/05/reparations-likely-to-divide-not-heal#comment_7748786,"This is a terrible way to close a financial gap. First of all, the financial gap is not race-based, it's how economic systems work. There has to be a financially underprivileged class otherwise nobody would do the shit work. Plenty of other races, including white people, are in the position of having to do shit work. It has nothing to do with race and everything to do with the folks who can afford half million dollar bribes to college admissions officials maintaining their elite status through any means afforded to them by their extant pile of money.
I reject the implied idea that white people have automatically benefited from the institution of slavery as a function of their race and black people did not. If there were benefits of slavery the institution, they would have been societal benefits that are not possible to withhold from modern non-slaves. For example, if slavery was used to build a road, everyone today uses that road to get places, regardless of skin tone. Any profits derived from slavery that launched or bolstered particular family dynasties would have had benefits limited to that particular family, and any that dissolved outward would have benefited all races.
So yeah, not in favor of reparations because it's a pretty obviously poor argument. It's really just a vote-buying scheme. Worse, it's a vote buying scheme that will never ever happen because it's such an objectively spectacularly bad idea."

Drug abuse seeps back into China today the same way it did when the British began marketing opium at huge profit in China back when. It was a top-down phenomenon then, starting in the prestigious huge lazy bureaucracies (once you passed the Confucian exams you had it made) and royal courts around major cities, then working its way downward as the Brits figured out they could drop the price, grow the market, and make more profit.

""It's easy to get lost trying to defend literal interpretations, especially when literal interpretations don't really matter.""
----Ken Shultz
""I suspect you were in favor of securing the border regardless of whether there were any rapists in the caravan, weren't you? If that's your position, then why not start from that point?""
----Ken Shultz
Example 1:
""There are plenty of rapists and child molesters among the caravans. Trump was right in this regard.""
----JesseAz
Why does this matter?
Example 2:
""I expected more of you Ken.""
----JesseAz
You expected me to defend claims that don't matter either way because Trump made them--or you expected me to believe Trump's claims about rapists and Al Qaeda in the caravan because I support border security?
Not sorry to have disappointed you.
Example 3:
""Other than to claim Trump said something he didn't?""
----JesseAz
So, now, not only were Trump's statements true--but he didn't actually make them?!
And all of this over a question that should have no bearing on whether we want to build a wall or support border security. Out of curiosity, what do you hope to accomplish by defending Trump's silly statements?
. . . and he's made a lot of them!"
