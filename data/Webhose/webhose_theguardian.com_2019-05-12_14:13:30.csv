The racists among us - and there are millions - voted for Brexit.
That does not mean that everyone who voted Leave is a racist, but it does mean that the millions of racists - mainly white English - see Brexit as something that legitimises their beliefs.
Now the Tories are determined to stop us having a vote on whatever Brexit they may manage to get parliament to finally let through.
Pretty obvious why. Many of the millions of racists are Conservative Party members or voters."

I should think Farage specializes in killing any joy at all, but I did meet one Greek woman in UK politics in the 1970s who was very similar in brushing up her legs and so forth with the utmost gusto to make her political point. One hears also, (not something i have ever tried) of the politician who focuses his attention on one woman in the audience to the exlcuson of all others, in order to get to home base, so to speak with the good lady after the meeting. It may bemore of a theatrical/ pop music skill than anything which would explain the groupies at the stage door of the big rock concerts, although even that may be a thing of the past.
Who Farage's groupies are, I cant imagine either, but he is such a special statuesque, unique person that there cant be many women who would not easily be lured by him. It is his Napoleonic stature, and his similar ambition, more than anything. Think of the Empress Josephine."

The second was at Glastonbury when I managed to persuade my partner to see him instead of stevie wonder! There were about 20 people on the tent and he was so messed up that he repeated the first 15 minutes of his set word for word including a joke that mixed up racist with rapist that bombed hard both times but he stuck to his guns and it was really surreal seeing it play out

Message two is do things you enjoy that get you out there. Meet ups can be great for doing things that you enjoy in mixed groups, also activities and evening classes - but make sure to pick ones that will have the gender of your choice attending also. I personally don’t think pubs and nightclubs are a good way to meet friends and lovers, especially when alcohol may be a factor. These are places for casual hook ups, but not good grazing grounds for more serious relationships. So get out there doing some fun old and new hobbies, and see who you meet. From hiking, to sports, to book reading, debating, philosophy or language arts type evening classes. The bonus is you have a great time and learn stuff or exercise even if you don’t meet the special one , so nothing is lost. Good luck and enjoy the adventure."

I never heard any Brexiters talk like that. They all talk about demcoracy and sovereignty. True, some point out that people died in defence of our vote while remainers casually suggest it should be ignored. Little doubt which side many of them would be one in the era of the the levellers, the chartists or the suffragettes. I heard a woman last night saying Brexiters were ""ahistorical"" for referring to ""liberation"" and colonialism. There's irony, Brexit is a demand for a little bit more democracy and self determination, it is incredibly modest in historical terms. Yet the reaction to it is just as hysterical as the reaction to the suffragettes or the reaction to those fighting colonialism. Brexiters want to re-instate parliamentary sovereignty not otherthrow it. But the reaction to it is like the furious reaction of the British to the Mau Mau uprising in Kenya.
It is the idea of democracy that strikes terror into their hearts."

"The left-behind v the metropolitan elite? That's a lazy, harmful cliche | Luke Cartledge | Opinion",www.theguardian.com,Kissingerwozhere,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/12/left-behind-v-metropolitan-elite-harmful-cliche#128026953,"Pretty hilarious hearing remain extremists bitch about cliches :-) Fuck me, the remain camp has broken the mould when it comers to lazy thinking, stereotyping 17.5 million Leave voters. Luke cry me a river,
Its no myth that 60% of Labour seats voted Leave. Its a fact. But instead of addressing the issues and seeing how to bring those folks into the folks, Luke says there is no problem, so we can completely ignore it. Move right along."
Halloween Brexit is a fitting outcome for the zombie prime minister | John Crace | UK news,www.theguardian.com,Delbart,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/12/halloween-brexit-fitting-outcome-for-zombie-prime-minister#128026868,"I personally don't think it was lack of information, I think was lack of definition as to what was meant by leave.
Did everyone who voted leave expect to void the GFA?
Did they all vote to put the unity of the UK in jeopardy?
How about decimating most industries exporting products to the EU?
Risk UK agriculture?
Shift the UK farther in to a service based economy?
No one bothered to spell out what leave was and Leave campaigners peddled all sorts of options including joining EFTA, the Canada+ deal (I think some now mention Canada ++); Possibly the least mentioned was the chaotic no deal, which looks like one of the front runners at the moment."
