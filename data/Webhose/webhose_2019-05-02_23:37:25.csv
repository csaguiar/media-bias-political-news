Crusaders name ‘No longer tenable’,yournz.org,Pete George,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://yournz.org/2019/04/03/crusaders-name-no-longer-tenable/,"2017 General Election Crusaders name ‘No longer tenable’
I have always not like the name ‘Crusaders’ for a modern sports team. I never thought it appropriate.neither would names like Mongols or Huns or Kmer Rouge.
Now, in the wake of the Christchurch mosque attacks, the team business owners say that the name is ‘no longer tenable’.
It’s probably not practical to change the name this season, but it should be replaced by next year.
ODT: ‘No longer tenable’: NZR boss says Crusaders set for change
The Crusaders have announced that they will be considering a change to their name and branding following the Christchurch terrorist attacks on 15 March – and that the status quo is ‘no longer tenable’.
The Christchurch-based Super Rugby franchise announced today that they will engage independent research company, Research First, to seek feedback and provide recommendations on the Crusaders team name and brand.
Crusaders CEO Colin Mansbridge said they are committed to taking the process seriously and doing the right thing.
“This is an event that rocked our community and brought some important issues to the fore,” Mansbridge said. “One of the contentious issues that has been brought up in the aftermath of the Christchurch attacks is the name of our rugby team – the Crusaders.
“Because of our desire to be the best we can be and to support our community, we are treating the question around the appropriateness of our brand extremely seriously.
We are committed to undertaking a thorough process, taking into account all relevant opinions and, most importantly, we are committed to doing the right thing.”
When the first year of Super Rugby kicked off in 1996, the Crusaders title was chosen for the side representing the provincial unions from the top half of the South Island and the brand was built on a stylised version of medieval England, in a nod to the English heritage of Christchurch.
I think it was poorly chosen, and should go. Share this:"

Russia Opens Military Helicopter Training Center In Venezuela,lunaticoutpost.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-119863.html,"Post: #1 Russia Opens Military Helicopter Training Center In Venezuela

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH62kinK7HM
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has opened a training center in Venezuela to help the country’s pilots fly Russian-made military helicopters, Russian state-owned industrial conglomerate Rostec said on Monday, Moscow’s latest gesture of support for President Nicolas Maduro.
Rostec said the center was inaugurated on Thursday last week, the same day as the White House warned Moscow and other countries backing Maduro against sending troops and military equipment, saying the United States would view such actions as a “direct threat” to the region’s security.
Washington, which backs Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, issued the warning after two Russian air force planes carrying nearly 100 military personnel landed outside Caracas, a contingent the Kremlin described as military specialists.
Rostec said the new training facility, the location of which it did not disclose, had been set up with the help of Russian specialists and was designed to train Venezuelan pilots to fly Russian-made Mi-35M helicopter gunships as well as Russian-made military transport helicopters.

Why the British should apologise to India,lunaticoutpost.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-119857.html,"Post: #1 Why the British should apologise to India
Advertisement The centenary of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre is the right occasion for Britain to apologise for the evils of colonialism.
Two years ago, on the UK publication of my book Inglorious Empire: What The British Did to India, I took the unusual step of demanding an apology from Britain to India. I even suggested the time and place – the centenary, on April 13, 2019, of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre in Amritsar. This single event was in many ways emblematic of the worst of the “Raj”, the British Empire in India.
The background to the massacre lay in the British betrayal of promises to reward India for its services in the First World War. After making enormous sacrifices, and an immense contribution in men and materiel, blood and treasure, to the British war effort, Indian leaders expected to be rewarded with some measure of self-government. Those hopes were belied.
When protests broke out, the British responded with force. They arrested nationalist leaders in the city of Amritsar and opened fire on protestors, killing ten. In the riot that ensued, five Englishmen were killed and an Englishwoman assaulted (though she was rescued, and carried to safety, by Indians). Brigadier General Reginald Dyer was sent to Amritsar to restore order; he forbade demonstrations or processions, or even gathering in groups of more than three.

In his remarks he told the students that he believes in “peace and security for everyone” and has joined the “war on terror in all its forms, variations and sources.” Abbas spoke in Arabic and his remarks were simultaneously translated into English for his overseas guests. But in a report disseminated Tuesday, Palestinian Media Watch said that Abbas’ remarks to the Harvard students contradicted remarks made the day before by his deputy, Mahmoud Al-Aloul. A day before, Al-Aloul praised the terrorist Omar Abu Laila, who last month murdered a 19-year-old soldier and a 47-year-old father of 12. “We are extremely proud [of] this Omar Abu Laila [who]….. represents all young Palestinians,” Al-Aloul wrote on the official Fatah Facebook page. “This is a well-rehearsed modus operandi in the Palestinian Authority,” said Nan Jacques Zilberdik, a senior analyst at PMW.

Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said Tuesday that his organization has given Israel a series of demands regarding its security prisoners who are set to begin a hunger strike next week.
The demands were passed to Israel by the Egyptian delegation currently trying to mediate an end to Gaza hostilities between the two sides. Israeli prison guards (Photo: Israel Prison Service)
1. Removing the cell phone jamming device
2. Lifting recent sanctions on the prisoners
3. Restoring visits for prisoners
4. Improving prison conditions
According to Hamas, some of the understandings with Israel will be implemented before the elections on April 9, and some afterwards.
The understandings that will be implemented before the elections are the simpler ones, such as expanding the fishing area off the Gaza coast (already done); easing restrictions on exported goods from Gaza; improving the electricity supply by operating the turbines at the power plant; and beginning projects that will provide temporary employment. Guards search the cells of Hamas prisoners at Ketziot Prison (Photo: IPS)
The understandings that will be implemented after the elections include the construction of another power line from Israel to Gaza within six months and the construction of a gas pipeline to the Gaza power plant within a year. In addition, the Palestinians are demanding the establishment of infrastructure and alternative energy projects.
The timetables will be presented to representatives of the Palestinian factions in Gaza, who will announce whether they accept or reject them.
Last week, the Israel Prison Service announced that it would charge the Hamas prisoners in Ramon Prison NIS 250,000 ($70,000) after they set fire to the mattresses in their cells last week.
The arson took place in the wing where mobile phones are being jammed by the IPS, which expressed concern that such a move would lead to attacks on prison guards, damage to prison property and riots.
A few days earlier, a prison guard at Ketziot Prison was stabbed in the neck by two security prisoners in the neck during a search of the site."

The analysis in this report is based on telephone interviews conducted March 20-25, 2019 among a national sample of 1,503 adults, 18 years of age or older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia (300 respondents were interviewed on a landline telephone, and 1,203 were interviewed on a cell phone, including 792 who had no landline telephone). The survey was conducted by interviewers under the direction of Abt Associates. A combination of landline and cell phone random digit dial samples were used; both samples were provided by Survey Sampling International, LLC. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. Respondents in the landline sample were selected by randomly asking for the youngest adult male or female who is now at home. Interviews in the cell sample were conducted with the person who answered the phone, if that person was an adult 18 years of age or older. The weighting procedure corrected for the different sampling rates. For detailed information about our survey methodology, see http://www.pewresearch.org/methodology/u-s-survey-research/ .
The combined landline and cell phone sample is weighted using an iterative technique that matches gender, age, education, race, Hispanic origin and nativity and region to parameters from the 2017 Census Bureau’s American Community Survey one-year estimates and population density to parameters from the Decennial Census. The sample also is weighted to match current patterns of telephone status (landline only, cell phone only, or both landline and cell phone), based on extrapolations from the 2018 National Health Interview Survey. The weighting procedure also accounts for the fact that respondents with both landline and cell phones have a greater probability of being included in the combined sample and adjusts for household size among respondents with a landline phone. The margins of error reported and statistical tests of significance are adjusted to account for the survey’s design effect, a measure of how much efficiency is lost from the weighting procedures.
The following table shows the unweighted sample sizes and the error attributable to sampling that would be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the survey:
Sample sizes and sampling errors for other subgroups are available upon request.

Large Majorities in Both Parties Say NATO is Good for the U.S.,www.people-press.org,Pew Research Center for the People and the Press,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.people-press.org/2019/04/02/large-majorities-in-both-parties-say-nato-is-good-for-the-u-s/,"Large Majorities in Both Parties Say NATO Is Good for the U.S. Wide partisan divide in views of U.S. compromising with allies
As the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) celebrates its 70 th anniversary this month, Americans overwhelmingly say being a member of NATO is beneficial for the United States.
Nearly eight-in-ten Americans (77%) – including large majorities in both parties – say being a member of NATO is good for the United States. These numbers are essentially unchanged from April 2016.
However, the public is more divided about whether the NATO alliance is more important to the United States or other NATO countries. A plurality of the public (42%) says NATO is about as important to the U.S. as it is to other NATO countries. About a third (34%) say the alliance is more important to other NATO countries, while just 15% say it is more important to the U.S.
While they agree that NATO membership is good for the U.S., Republicans and Democrats differ over the alliance’s importance to its members. Nearly half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (47%) say NATO is more important to other NATO countries than the U.S.; only a quarter of Democrats and Democratic leaners say the same. These views also are little changed since 2016, during the presidential campaign.
The survey by Pew Research Center, conducted March 20-25 among 1,503 adults, also finds: Americans remain divided on whether the U.S. should have an active role in the world: 49% say the United States should pay less attention to problems overseas and concentrate on problems here at home. A somewhat smaller share (44%) says it’s best for the future if the U.S. is active in world affairs. These views are little changed from two years ago, but in 2014 a majority said the U.S. should focus less on international problems. A majority of the public (54%) says the U.S. should take into account the interests of U.S. allies even if means making compromises with them; 40% say the U.S. should follow its national interests “even when its allies strongly disagree.” As in recent years, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to favor cooperating with allies even if it means compromising with them. Partisan gap over whether U.S. should be active in world affairs
Over the past five years, Democrats have shifted toward favoring an active U.S. presence in world affairs. Today, 51% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say it’s best for the country to be active in world affairs. A somewhat smaller share of Democrats (43%) say the country should focus on problems here at home. These views have changed little since 2017, but in 2014 only 38% of Democrats said it was best for the future of the U.S. for it to be active globally.
Among Republicans and Republican leaners, a majority (57%) continues to favor the U.S. paying less attention to problems overseas and focusing domestically. About four-in-ten (37%) say the country should be active in world affairs, which is largely unchanged since 2011.
More whites favor an active U.S. presence in world affairs than blacks or Hispanics. About half of white Americans (49%) say its best for the country to be active in world affairs, but just 39% of Hispanics and 29% of blacks say the same.
Support for an active U.S. role in world affairs is concentrated among white Democrats: 63% of white Democrats and Democratic leaners say the U.S. should be active globally, while just 39% of white Republicans say the same. Among nonwhite Democrats, fewer than half (38%) support an active U.S. role, placing their views closer to those of white Republicans than white Democrats.
More educated Americans are the most supportive of an active U.S. presence on the world stage. A strong majority of those with a postgraduate degree (66%) say the U.S. should be active globally, compared to 29% saying it should concentrate on domestic problems. Those who have a four-year college degree are more narrowly divided, but a majority favors an active U.S. global role (56% active vs. 40% pay less attention).
Americans who have not completed college tend to favor paying less attention to problems overseas and concentrating here at home. Larger shares of those with some college experience (52% vs. 38%) and those with a high school degree or less (56% vs. 39%) say we should pay less attention overseas than say it’s best to be active in world affairs.
Whites without a college degree are skeptical of an active U.S. presence in world affairs. About half of whites without a college degree (51%) say the U.S. should pay less attention to problems overseas. Most whites with a college degree take the opposite view (64% say U.S. should be active in world affairs); only a third say we should pay less attention to international problems.
Older adults are somewhat more likely than younger people to support the U.S. being active in world affairs: 48% of those age 50 and older say it’s best for the future to be active globally, compared with 41% among those ages 18 to 49. Views of U.S. relationship with its allies
A majority of Americans (54%) say “the U.S. should take into account the interests of its allies even if it means making compromises with them,” while 40% say “the U.S. should follow its own national interests even when its allies strongly disagree.”
A wide partisan gap remains on how accommodating the U.S. should be toward its allies. A strong majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners (69%) say the U.S. should compromise with allies. About half as many Republicans and Republican leaners (35%) say the same.
Younger and more educated Americans are more supportive of the U.S. compromising with its allies than older adults and those with less education.
A majority of those age 18 to 29 (61%) say the U.S. should take into account allies’ interests even if it means making compromises. Only about a third (36%) say the U.S. should follow its own interests when allies strongly disagree. Adults age 65 and older are about evenly divided (47% vs. 44%).
Large majorities of postgraduates (74%) and four-year college graduates (68%) say the U.S. should take allies’ interests into account. About half of those with some college education (52%) and 44% of those with a high school education or less agree.
Whites without a college degree are about equally divided between compromising with allies (48%) and following U.S. national interests when allies disagree (45%). College-educated whites largely favor taking into account allies’ interests and compromising when necessary (70% say this). Most say world problems would be worse without the U.S.
A large majority of Americans (64%) say that problems in the world would be worse without U.S. involvement, in a separate survey conducted in January. About three-in-ten (29%) say that U.S. involvement in the world generally hurts more than it helps.
Since 2016, the share of Americans who say global problems would be worse without U.S. involvement has increased seven percentage points, from 57% to 64%. All of the change has come among NATO Foreign policy for release Republicans and Republican-leaning independents: Currently, 76% say problems would worse without U.S. involvement, up from 60% three years ago.
Democrats’ views are little changed over this period. In the January survey, 56% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say world problems would be worse without U.S. involvement.
Younger Americans are more likely to say that U.S. involvement in the world usually makes problems worse compared with those 50 and older. Those under 30 are about evenly divided with 43% saying that U.S. involvement usually makes problems worse, and 50% saying that things would be even worse without U.S. involvement.
While there are partisan differences in these attitudes, there are no ideological divides within the parties on the question of whether the U.S. does more harm than good on the international stage. Pagination "

Dr Leana Wen , President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America ( PPFA ), visited the Rhode Island State House to help local advocates push for the Senate passage of the Reproductive Health Care Act ( RHCA ) ( S0152A ), which will codify the protections of Roe v Wade into Rhode Island state law upon passage. The bill was introduced by Rhode Island State Senator Gayle Goldin (Democrat, District 3, Providence) with 16 cosponsors and now awaits a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee . Leana Wen
“In 2019, already more than 250 bills have been introduced across the country that directly restrict abortion access. With Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, the landscape for women is even more dire. States are a critical backstop to protecting the right to safe, legal abortion,” said Dr Wen. “It’s Rhode Island’s turn to stop politicians from directly interfering with medical practice and endangering women’s lives. We urge the Senate to stand with us and vote to protect women’s health and the health of families and communities.”
“With reproductive freedom under constant attack from the federal government, it is more important now than ever for the Senate Committee on Judiciary to pass the Reproductive Health Care Act and send the bill to the chamber for a full vote,” said Amanda Skinner , President and CEO of Planned Parent of Southern New England ( PPSNE ). “Rhode Island residents overwhelmingly support access to safe, legal abortion. We need the Senate to listen to their constituents and take action to pass the RHCA now.”
“All individuals have the right to bodily autonomy, and a woman should always have control and say over when and if she wants to have children,” said Senator Melissa Murray (Democrat, District 24, Woonsocket, North Smithfield), cosponsor of the RHCA. “We need to trust women. Trust them to manage their own health, to make their own decisions, to plan their families and their futures, and to do what is best for them in their own circumstances.”
“Abortion, like pap smears and prenatal care, is essential health care,” said Dr Beth Cronin , Vice Chair of the Rhode Island Section of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists . “Protecting an individual’s right to end a pregnancy is necessary for the health and well-being of all pregnant individuals. The Reproductive Health Care Act is vital to ensuring everyone has access to the full range of medical treatment options.”
On March 7, advocates celebrated the passage of the Reproductive Privacy Act , ( H5125A ), sponsored by Representative Anastasia Williams (Democrat, District 9, Providence). The bill passed with a vote of 44-30, including 60 percent of all Democrats and 21 of the 26 women in the House.
“This is our moment to make the change that needs to be made. We are halfway there, and we cannot allow anyone to stop us,” said Representative Williams. “We need to celebrate once we accomplish this in the Senate. We have waited long enough—and we’re ready.”
Planned Parenthood of Southern New England (PPSNE) is one of the region’s largest providers of family planning and reproductive health care services. Since 1923, PPSNE has evolved into an organization with 17 health centers in Connecticut and Rhode Island, delivering care to 75,000 patients annually. For more than 95 years, PPSNE health centers provided a broad range of services, sexual health education, information and health counseling. Ninety percent of the services provided are preventive.

Bipartisanship Barack Obama State Of The Union For this president, liberal certitude is never partisan, unlike the moral and intellectual corruption of the GOP position. ""BREAKING,"" tweeted the Associated Press, ""President Obama to say US faces choice between fear of change and confidence in its future."" That was about right. Obama's SOTU was a crescendo of false choices pitting the future (bolstered by science, optimism and rational thinking) against the icky past (anti-science, anti-love and anti-reason). Francis Wilkinson put it well in Bloomberg View when he noted that Obama's performance was not a speech but an indictment.
The president, despite offering a scattering of platitudes about the importance of genuine public debate (Paul Ryan was singled out for expressing an interest in ""tackling poverty,"" because, as you're all surely aware, conservatives normally champion destitution), never really acknowledged that the views of his detractors could be formed by some sincere, philosophical objection about the best approach to fixing things—or even that Americans might disagree on what exactly needs fixing.
But, you know, if you're not psyched about transforming every leftist hobbyhorse into the next space program, it can only mean you're terrified of the 21st century.
Obama went on to claim that democracy doesn't work if we believe that ""the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice."" I don't know about that. Through seven years of his presidency, liberals have regularly accused political opponents of being motivated by racism, misogyny, bloodlust-driven warmongering, selfishness and an irrational and mysterious need to destroy democracy at the behest of the super-wealthy.
This is not just the position of columnists, bloggers and activists but also that of the leadership of the Democratic Party. How many times has Obama argued that Republicans only reject his ideas because they have some deep dislike of him personally? And how many times have we heard that Republicans are basing their ideas on conspiracies? ""Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction,"" the president said. Anyone who believes in human adaptability over climate alarmism values partisanship over the fate of the earth. Anyone who is critical of illiberal ideologies and faiths is a xenophobe.
""If we want a better politics, it's not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president,"" he explained. ""We have to change the system to reflect our better selves."" Obama, who spent over $1 billion keeping the presidency in 2012, will discover his better self by campaigning to limit free speech for those he deems have too much money—and other special interests (abortionists, unionists, rent seekers, crony clean-energy groups and other morally uncorrupted interests excluded)—to blunt rigorous debate.
Which reminds me: My favorite part of Tuesday's speech was the president's assertion that the Founding Fathers wanted us to argue about ""the meaning of liberty."" This was the only time Obama mentioned the word ""liberty"" in his speech, and when he spoke about ""freedom,"" it was never in the context of the Constitution.
Now, I wouldn't claim to know exactly what the founders desired for us, beyond mentioning that they codified many ideas of the Enlightenment and specifically wrote them down for us to follow, sometimes even numbering them so we would understand. Although they certainly debated some of these notions, it is implausible to believe that any Founding Father would be OK with forcing the Little Sisters of the Poor to pay for someone else's birth control or forcing Americans to report to a bureaucracy such as the IRS before engaging in political speech. Progressives want to redefine freedom as a form of dependency and common good, not argue about its traditional contours. So yes, some people are suspicious of ""change.""
Meanwhile, the president believes that early-20th-century Progressive economic ideas are the freshest thing going. Fine. But by any historical measure, arguing that markets can't serve the public good without being micromanaged by the state is no bolder or newer than arguing for a renewed laissez-faire attitude. An inability to implement those ideas does not mean politics is broken. We have intractable disagreements.
We no longer have the capacity to come together on big policy. Fact is, I couldn't recognize America anywhere in Obama's long harangue, and I'm probably not alone. Anyone who believes he has a monopoly over the ""future"" deserves the suspicion and rancor that come with politics. It's not to say that blind partisanship or uniformity is productive or that Republicans have answers. But partisanship—as in prejudice toward a particular cause—allows us to avoid destructive national political ""unity."" So as rancorous as partisanship is, it's far less destructive than Obama's political ideal.

(April 2, 2019) Leading Civil Society Organizations in Liberia [Center for Transparency and Accountability (CENTAL), Institute for Research and Democratic Development (IREDD) and Naymote Partners for Democratic Development (NAYMOTE)] are deeply concerned over emerging national issues that have the propensity to derail political and economic gains made over the past 13 years. These concerns range from the management of the Liberian economy, respect for rule of law and the constitution, limited political will to robustly fight corruption as well as the dwindling of civic space for citizen’s participation in the democratic process, and freedom of press and of expression.
State of the Liberian Economy
We have keenly followed with dismay the deteriorating rate at which the Liberian Economy has weakened over the past 13 months. For example, the exchange rate between the Liberian Dollar and the United States Dollar is scarily plummeting, the costs of basic commodities have doubled over the past 12 months, despite the decision taken by the government to reduce tariffs on 2,000 commodities in May 2018. With the pace at which things are proceeding, if pragmatic steps are not taken by the government to salvage the economy, we are afraid that we would be heading down the slope of hyperinflation. This is making life unbearable for many, especially ordinary Liberians and rural dwellers, many of whom are without jobs and better livelihood opportunities. Generally, short-term measures undertaken the CDC-led government, including the “25 million mop of exercise” have not worked, thus leading to perpetuation of the problems. On the other hand, the Liberian Legislature seems to be dragging its/her feet in providing the necessary administrative oversight in helping to resuscitate the economy and improve the governance landscape.
On the State of corruption
We want to commend the government for establishing committees to investigate a number of corruption allegations and scandals, including the national housing authority corruption saga, the alleged 16 billion missing money and the US25 million mop up exercise as well as establishment of the Concession Review committee to review all existing concession from the previous government.
While we applaud the government for these steps, we are extremely disappointed in the slow pace at which these investigations are proceeding.
For example, in February 2018, the President ordered the review of all concessions entered into by the previous administration. More than one year since the committee was constituted, it is yet to make public its findings or update the public about the status of the review exercise. Additionally, in April 2018, the President ordered an investigation of Exxon Mobil Fraudulent acquisition of oil block 13. Till date, outcome of that investigation has not been made public. This is compounded by limited political will to comprehensively audit the past administration and prosecute those who allegedly misapplied public resources as well enforce existing laws and policies, including the Code of Conduct for Public Officials, part 10 of which provides for officials who make decisions affecting contracting, tendering or procurement, and issuance of licenses of various types to declare their assets, incomes and liabilities before taking office.
On the Provision of Basic Social Services
Our monitoring efforts across the country have uncovered rapid decline in the provision of basic social services, particularly health. Our evidence shows that conditions at health centers are extremely alarming. In all of the 15 political sub-divisions, there is a complete breakdown of health service delivery: there are no essential drugs and supplies at health facilities as well as fuel to run generators at health centers and county administrations. This places citizen at risk and exposes the vulnerability of our health system to preventable diseases outbreaks including Ebola and have the potential of worsening our already high maternal mortality of 1072.
On the Respect for the Rule of Law and the Constitution
There is an apparent resurgence of lawlessness and disrespect for the rule of law and institutions of governance. For example:
The District # 13, Montserrado County electoral violence saga which report is yet to be released is troubling;
The investigation of alleged vandalism and firing at District # 10, Montserrado County involving Rep. Yekeh Kolubah;
The attack on Roots FM radio station;
Violence in Glan Town, Gbei & Doru Nimba on January 2019 that led to 2 deaths
The mob violence in Ganta City, Nimba County on March 2019 that led to 2 deaths
Increase in the report of rape cases and violence against women
The burning down of Weala Police Stations and Magisterial Court in Margibi County. We the undersigned civil society organizations strongly condemn the use of violence of all form as a means of seeking justice. We want to state emphatically that violence has no place in our society and the Liberia national police must take frantic steps to restore law and order and public confidence and trust in the police.
According to the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection, in 2018 alone (over a period of nine months), 1,484 SGBV cases were reported, and of the total, 971 were rape cases.
Recommendations:
We call on the president of Liberia to take leadership in the fight against corruption
We call on the president, the legislature and government at large to ensure the respect for the rule of law and the constitution of Liberia;
We call on the Liberia National Police to be proactive and more efficient in the discharge of their duties;
We call on all citizens, particularly young people to stop the use of violence as a means of seeking redress and rather use constitutionally established channels for grievance redress;
We call on the government to conduct a comprehensive audit of the past administration
We call on the government for the timely completion of all the ongoing investigations it has launched and the completion and release of reports by a number of committees it has constituted;
We call on the government to invest and build the capacity of LRA to enhance the country’s domestic resource mobilization;

Chipping in his nationalistic advises to his kinsmen and nation, the former Liberian Ambassador to the United States, Lewis Garseedah Brown II has written an open letter to his kinsmen about the current of affairs, a society he described as ‘Becoming too noisy’. Below is the full text of Mr. Brown’s open letter:
My fellow Liberians:
A few weeks ago, I received a WhatsApp Message from a good and dear friend. Said my observant friend, the “eloquence” of my silence was “concerning”. I had not imagined that eloquence was to silence. All along, I had thought it was to speech. However, the message concerned me just the same. I am yet to explain to my trusted friend that more often than not, contemplation is best achieved in silence.
In any case, it is my observation that our society is becoming too noisy, and seemingly, too disagreeable. Civil discourse and common decency are being lost. And with the loss, the character of our politics, rather than uplifting, is becoming increasingly toxic, and plagued with negativity, repudiation and suspicion. Distrust is high, and strangely, friends are too easily settling for enmity.
Our public discourses are wilting into exchanges of intolerance as we grapple with a seeming resort to lawlessness and disrespect to assert a claim. Rather than a search for higher grounds and an appeal to our better selves, we are quickly degenerating into lowering standards of self-destruction, political division and fear. Shockingly, we have seen this play out before, and Liberians have all paid dearly for it.
From places of worship to social media platforms, the increasingly unmistakable impression is to wish the worst for each other, and even worse, to wish the worst for our country. We are quickly losing a sense of shared achievement and common purpose, even for our country. We brazenly exude the impression that for one to win, the other must necessarily lose. What we seem to be accepting is an attitude that pervades the worst, and not the best in each of us, and our country.
I had imagined this to be a temporary phase which was perhaps occasioned by a long and grueling electioneering process that understandably strained our division along lines of political associations. As such, I have tried to still my voice away from it with the hope that it would eventually pass. Unfortunately, it appears to be worsening. We cannot continue this way!
With obvious painful reminders, our experiences have shown that the growing division and enmity we are feeding – consciously or unconsciously – inevitably leads to our collective self-destruction. Against the backdrop of this historical truth, we cannot permit any grievance or discontent to again usher us onto the certain path of our collective self-destruction.
Contentious as the electioneering process may have been, all Liberians need to understand, and accept, that it is over. It is time to move on. Whether we won or lost, the people for whom we ran, and ourselves, are hurting by the challenges to our economy, and the increasing discord in the country. And as if we needed a stark reminder, our projected economic growth has been lowered by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This is a wakeup and rally call for all Liberians. Our country is in a difficult place, and the difficulty affects all of us.
Quite simply, opposition and ruling authorities alike ought to demonstrate a level of seriousness about these presenting challenges, and be so deeply engaged with each other in the national search for workable and sustainable solutions from which the country is certain to benefit. This, therefore, cannot be the time to trade blames, foster disunity in the advance of a common purpose, and or lend our thoughts, voices and actions to divisiveness, and ill-will toward each other. This, certainly, is not the time to permit the pursuit of illegal means to achieve political ends. None of us can afford this!
In aiding any serious efforts toward economic recovery, as a prerequisite, our country needs political stability.
Including that of our own, history teaches us that political instability and creeping lawlessness can only worsen economic woes. The same is also true of our history in its harsh reminder that “Us Versus Them” is a certain recipe for our collective failure. It does not really matter if you consider yourself to be “US”, or to be “Them”, we are all in the same battered canoe, battling the rising tides of a tempestuous ocean, and destined to drown, together, on the silliness of our divisions, or sail along on the strength of our unity and commitment to work together.
Therefore, in governing and in opposing, what we must seek to foster, especially at this time, is a deepening sense of “Us AND Them”. As history repeatedly shows, this enables nations to harness the fullness of their potentials, and to successfully tackle and overcome the presenting challenges in bridging differences, and in building more sustainable societies.
Hopefully though, we have a chance to self-reflect, and self-correct.
Recently, I heard of the appointment of Dr. Amos C. Sawyer to lead an effort toward the convening of a national dialogue. Although I am unaware about the details around this, it appears to me to be a right and welcoming thing to do. My hope is that a national dialogue will afford the opportunity for serious, open and broader reflections on the lingering issues of division, and recommit us to those things that ought to unite us.
Indeed, we may not altogether solve the dysfunction of our economy at a national dialogue. However, and hopefully, we can be meaningfully resolved on a sense of shared ownership of our presenting problems, and its solutions. We can march forward, and will ourselves to meet our national difficulties, not as divided as we are but as one people bonded by history and destiny, and knowing that each obstacle to our collective advance affects all of us irrespective of perceived political, religious, gender and tribal differences.
Our simple truth is that a better Liberia – one committed to the rule of law, and unburdened by the colored lenses of partisanships – benefits all Liberians. Ruling and opposition, we must bring ourselves to recommit to the building of that better Liberia for ourselves, and for our children. And by the good examples which ought to attend a national dialogue, we can begin the needed healing to the body politic, and forge the united front we desperately need in tackling our presenting problems.
I know we may not always agree on everything. But surely, we can elevate the national discourse, and even when we disagree, we can do so with respect for one another, and without seeming so disagreeable. We cannot all belong to one political party or work in the administration. But certainly, the variety of Liberian talents and expertise located in the many political parties can somehow be reasonably harnessed and exploited in the building of the country we all so dearly love.
I know we may not all win every time. But surely, we can celebrate one another’s success, and we can share in one another’s loss. This, too, is who we are.
Even in our differences, I know we can be receptive to truth even if it seems to contradict ours. We can be tolerant of one another even when we disagree; and we can be welcoming of ideas even if they seem to clash with, and challenge ours. We can all aspire to higher ideals and actions without willing another Liberian, and our country to fail, or to fall.
Wherever we are, whatever our differences, and in all that we aspire to do for our country, we can all become better, and commit ourselves to doing better. I know we can find our better angels.
And finally, I know that we can write the history of the presenting moment so that succeeding generations will favorably recall that we were not found wanting in the face of challenges to our unity, and in the midst of other compelling national difficulties. We can allow this moment to speak glowingly to how we met each challenge – as we always should – together, and thereby, overcame our difficulties.
We can let this difficult moment stand out in history proudly revealing that rather than our worst, we amplified the best in our Liberian character; and that rather than fell, we rose – and soared – together. We met “the foe with valor unpretending”. And we made Liberia better for the next generation. We can do this.
Perhaps my silence was “eloquent”.
I wish all Liberians all the best.
Sincerely,"

The Criminal Court “A” at the Temple of Justice on Monday sentenced a Nigerian ‘prophet’ Revival Womo Sam to ten years in jail in connection to the crime of human trafficking of a 15 year-old girl.
Defendant Sam was charged with multiple crimes human trafficking, kidnapping and rape.
He was reportedly arrested by the Liberia National Police on January 2019 and forwarded to the Monrovia City Court to answer to the charges levied against him.
Defendant Sam is the founder of the Global Revival Movement located in the Dixville community where both parents and the victim were members.
Handing down the final ruling, Presiding Judge Roosevelt Z. Willie said predicated upon the facts and circumstances and the law citations of both parties, which were explained to the trial jurors, who returned with a unanimous guilty verdict against the ‘prophet’ that the court has confirmed.
“Further this ruling is based upon a careful observation of all evidences and witnesses testimonies during the trial, and based upon defendant’s own confession to the allegation against him, and linking him (defendant) to said crime,” the judge said.
According to Judge Willie, the parents of the victim explained that they had turned over the girl to the defendant in 2016 for spiritual cleansing due to repeated “bad dreams” she was experiencing after her biological mother died.
“While the fifteen year-old victim was staying with the defendant, the parents observed after several months that the prophet had changed the victim’s name, something the parents were not aware of.
“After some time, the parents requested for the victim to return home but the defendant refused and instead prepared a passport for them to leave the country for Nigeria unknown to the parents.
The parents then proceeded to Nigeria with the help of their family member where they were able to locate the victim already pregnant, and after she had given birth the prophet came back with her to Liberia to discuss marrying the victim.
It was then he was arrested by police during the family meeting with the parents.
The judge explained that while the Criminal Court “A” does not have jurisdiction over rape cases, it therefore forwarded the indictment to the Criminal Court “E” for prosecution, while his court only tried the defendant on the charge of human trafficking.
During the reading of the indictment earlier, the defendant pledged not guilty to the charge.
Meanwhile, the defendant will serve eight years behind bars, and two years will be for community service based upon good behavior that will be determined by the correction officers.

The Ministry of Finance and Development Planning has paid to the account of Grand Bassa County the sum of L$6, 437,077.50 for the implementation of development projects as resolved at the 10th County Council Sitting.
The disclosure was made in a quarterly report from the Project Management Committee (PMC) of the County chaired by Mr. Moses Gbehzohngar Henry.
Henry, in his report explained that the money released through a cheque represents 40% of US$100,000 that should have been released earlier, adding that the county nevertheless welcome the amount made available and anticipate the remaining 60 percent soon.
“Since the conduct of the December 7, 2018 County Council Sitting in Buchanan, this is the first amount paid into the County Account from the Finance Ministry,” the report stated.
Henry attributed the availability of the funds that comes from the County and Social Development Funds to the vigorous and consistent collaborative engagement of the County Legislative Caucus, the PMC along with the local administration headed by Supt Janjay Baikpeh with the Ministry of Finance.
The funds released have placed the county authorities in the state of using the scale of preference in deciding which project to prioritize amongst the projects named in the resolution of the County Sitting.
Prior to remittance of the money, the Bassa Legislative Caucus through its Chairman, Rep. Thomas Alexander Goshua, mandated the PMC to reduce its support staff from ten persons to one, who is the driver, a decision the report confirmed has been taken through a contract termination letter.
Henry also mentioned in the report that such letter terminating the support staff contract was written on grounds that upon the availability of money, the county would pay the staff one year salary arrears as captured in the 10th County Council Sitting resolution last year.
Stating challenges, the PMC quarterly report highlighted delay in accessing development funds from the Finance Ministry which caused projects to be undone, lack of fuel, stationery and other office equipment; causing the team to improvise and also hindering the PMC smooth operation.
The PMC via Chairman Henry recommended that the County and Social Development Funds be paid into the county’s account instead of direct deposit through central government and that the Legislative Caucus gives full support to the Fiscal Affairs Superintendent and the PMC to ensure that the county receives the full sum of what is due it.

Being a critical journalist nowadays in Liberia as a professional journalist whose main quest is to report the facts nothing but the facts is said to be scaring as details released by some media owners that the lives of active and professional journalists will be at risk for doing their jobs.
Speaking on a local talk show, the 50-50, in Monrovia, today, April 2, 2019, Mr. Philibert Browne, Publisher of the Hot pepper Newspaper, disclosed that some critical journalists have been earmarked by some individuals to be eliminated due to their professional reportage on the activities of the CDC-led government, and further warned his colleagues to be careful in their day to day activities as journalists.
Mr. Browne speaking further, cautioned his colleagues, many of whom he named as T-Max Jlateh of the Sky FM; Host of the 50-50 call-in morning show, Henry Costa of the Roots FM, Philip Wesseh of the Inquirer Newspaper, and he himself have been targeted by people he alleged have been ordered to eliminate anyone who dare to criticize this government.
“Please be informed that there are people who have been ordered to eliminate many of us that are critical on this government, therefore, I warn that we as journalists should be very careful in our daily movement,” Mr. Brown speaking via mobile phone on the show said.
This latest revelation by the Hot Pepper Newspaper is said to be scaring, as many are wondering as to where Liberia is now heading.
Some ordinary Liberians who spoke to the GNN in separate interview are expressing serous concern about this, and further calling on the government to quickly probe those behind this alleged assignation plot on journalists as being reported.
But in reaction to this alleged plan to assassinate any journalist, the Deputy Minister for Public Affairs at the Ministry of Information, Eugene Farhgon described the allegation as ‘unfortunate’, noting that the government of President Weah has no plan to assassinate anyone as being alleged, and furrier noted that since the coming to power there has been no journalist in jail and less to speak of assassination.

The Liberia National Police has restored calm to Weala in Margibi County and made several arrests after throngs of motorcyclists protesting the “mysterious” killing of a colleague burned down the Weala Magisterial Court on Monday.
The Liberia News Agency correspondent said the demonstrators also burned down the Weala and Bopolu Police depots, and several private buildings owned by a local businessman.
The situation brought normal activities in Weala and surrounding areas to a standstill for hours with the main national highway leading to Monrovia closed to vehicular traffic.
The motorcyclists’ action was in response to a recent “mysterious” killing of a fellow motorcyclist, identified as Moses Wolopaye (alias PCK).
During the protest, the Superintendent of Margibi County and the District Representative made an appeal to the rioters to keep calm but they refused to listen to their leaders and rather continue their protest.
It can be recalled that on Friday, March 1, two unidentified persons hired the services of the late motorcyclist Moses Wolopaye to transport them to Worhn, the headquarters of Gibi District in upper Margibi County, promising to pay him a transport fare of L$800, about L$600 more than the regular fare usually charged from Weala to Worhn.
After their departure, Wolopaye, aged 21, went missing and his decomposed remains was later discovered on March 6, along the Peter Town-Gibi highway with several body parts extracted.
Since the incidence, residents of the area, mainly motorcyclists, have complained that the Police investigation was being delayed, prompting the riot on Monday.
Police spokesman Moses Carter confirmed to the Liberia News Agency (LINA) that the LNP has responded to the Weala, Margibi County riot and has returned calm.
He told LINA that over 100 persons have been arrested so far with more arrests to be made.
“They burned down the Weala Magisterial Court, Police station and the Town Hall in Bopolu,” Carter said, adding that “our officers are doing a great job in bringing the situation under control.”
“The violence started as early as 7:00 a.m. when some aggrieved motorcyclists set up road blocks thereby barricading the main road in demand of justice for one of their colleagues whose body was found in the bush in Weala,” he confirmed.
“While LNP investigators were trying to get a link as to the perpetrator of the act, these aggrieved cyclists jumped in the streets in demand of justice for their colleagues on grounds that we (LNP) were not paying attention to the death of their fallen colleague,” Carter noted.
“They even went on the rampage looting properties of citizens of Weala. More arrests are being made,” he said.

U.S.-backed Syrian fighters are battling the Islamic State group in eastern Syria 10 days after declaring victory over the extremists, an official with the Kurdish-led force said Tuesday.
Mustafa Bali, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, said they are rooting out groups of militants who were hiding in caves in and near the village of Baghouz. He added that SDF experts are still removing mines and booby-traps in areas liberated in recent weeks.
The SDF declared military victory over IS on March 23 after liberating what it said was the last pocket of territory held by the militants. The victory marked the end of the brutal self-styled caliphate the group carved out in large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014.
The nearly five-year war left a swath of destruction across both countries and ended in Baghouz, a tiny village near the Iraqi border where the cornered militants made their last stand, under a grueling siege for weeks."

Weala Police Depot and other public and private buildings and properties were set ablaze by angry youth over the death of their colleague
In the wake of reports of the ritualistic murder of a local motorcyclist in Weala, Upper Margibi County, commercial motorcyclists on Monday, April 1, 2019, went on the rampage and burned down the only police depots in Weala and the Baypolue, the Baypolue Magisterial Court and several other privately-owned buildings, the Liberia News Agency (LINA) Margibi County correspondent has reported.
According to the report, the motorcyclists’ violent action yesterday brought normal activities in Weala and other surrounding communities to a total standstill as tension was high, which compelled the closure of the main Kakata/Gbarnga highway to vehicular movement for some hours.
According to LINA, the motorcyclists reportedly destroyed several other businesses, among them a building owned by local businessman, Stephen Tokpah, (alias ‘Park it Better’). The motorcyclists’ action stands from the recent death of fellow motorcyclist, Moses Wolopaye (alias ‘PCK’).
PCK was reportedly hired by two unknown men, who later allegedly murdered him and extracted some of his body parts. Up to quelling of the riot yesterday, security officers were yet to arrest the perpetrators.
According to reports quoting local residents from the area, on Friday, March 1, 2019, two unidentified persons reportedly hired the services of motorcyclist Moses Wolopaye, 21, to take them to Worhn, Gibi District Headquarters in Upper Margibi County on the promise to pay a generous fare of L$800, rather than the regular amount of L$200 that is usually charged from Weala to Worhn.
Burning road blockade in Weala
Further, according to reports, shortly after Wolopaye and the unidentified men departed for Worhn, Wolopaye allegedly went missing; only to find his decomposed body along the Peter Town-Gibi highway with several body parts allegedly extracted.
Margibi County Superintendent and the District Representative tried pleading with the motorcyclists, who appeared very incensed about the alleged murder of their colleague and, according to local officials, instead proceeded to engage in violent mob action which resulted in the destruction of properties.
Police have however restored calm in the area, following the arrest of several persons they believed were involved in the riot.
Some of the rioters claimed to have earlier written a communication to the Superintendent, calling on the government to act promptly by finding the perpetrators and bringing them to justice within three days, or else they would have taken the matter into their own hands, not ruling out possible violent mass action.

If you haven’t heard about the impending avocado apocalypse if the border is closed then you don’t follow many millennials on social media. And for that I envy you. But if you do, and you have, then you’ll get the joke in tonight’s Late Show cold open.
Because no avocados is the actual end of the world, you see.
As is often the case with the cold open , it begins with the fake news “Late Show News Network” premise, using audio/video from an actual news clip overlaid with Late Show graphics to set the premise: Mad Guac.
The parody features actual footage from Mad Max , dubbed over for the avacodalypse. Good premise, some of the jokes were thin, but you can never bash millennials too often or too harshly, so it had that going for it. It ended with the shot of Mel Gibson, pretty good dubbing, and the movie title punchline “Mad Guac: The Avocado Warrior.”
Pretty amusing premise, not least because it almost matches the actual tone of some of the worried millennials.

Ahlam Tamimi, a Hamas terrorist sentenced to 16 life sentences for her involvement in the 2001 Sbarro pizzeria suicide bombing in Jerusalem, says that she has “gained strength” since she was released from prison in October 2011 and moved to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. In an interview with Al-Jazeera , which was translated from Arabic into English by the Middle East Media Research Institute, Tamimi explains how release and the release of her husband “brought great joy and was the beginning of our new life, after the Zionist entity had sentenced us to life in prison.” However, she said that recently, the American authorities are demanding she be extradited to the United States and tried there. “The issue has shaken our lives to some extent,” she told Al-Jazeera. But she said that being in Jordan protects her. “Jordan does not have an extradition agreement with the United States. This led to the issuing of a legal decision refusing my extradition, and Jordan’s position on that matter is very clear,” she said. Further, she told Al-Jazeera that she is not a terrorist. “Why am I, Ahlam, considered to be a terrorist, when I am part of a movement for freedom and liberation?” she asked. “I am part of a resistance movement that strives for liberation.” Tamimi’s interview was conducted on March 28 and aired on the Al-Jazeera website. It was not aired on its TV channel. The August 9, 2001 Sbarro bombing has also been referred to as the Sbarro massacre. The event left 15 civilians murdered, including seven children and a pregnant American woman, and 130 wounded. Those killed included Malki Roth, 15, an American-Israeli citizen for whom the Malki Foundation is named; Giora Balash, 60, of Brazil; Zvika Golombek, 26, of Carmiel; Shoshana Yehudit Greenbaum, 31, of the US; Tehila Maoz, 18, of Jerusalem; Frieda Mendelsohn, 62, of Jerusalem; Michal Raziel, 16, of Jerusalem; Mordechai Schijveschuurder, 43, of Neria; Tzira Schijveschuurder, 41, of Neria; Ra'aya Schijveschuurder, 14, of Neria; Avraham Yitzhak Schijveschuurder, 4, of Neria; Hemda Schijveschuurder, 2, of Neria; Lily Shimashvili, 33, of Jerusalem; Tamara Shimashvili, 8, of Jerusalem; and Yocheved Shoshan, 10, of Jerusalem. Hamas and the Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack. Tamimi is currently wanted by the US government for conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction against US nationals abroad, and the FBI, which considers her to be armed and dangerous, has placed Tamimi on its list of most wanted terrorists and offers a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to her arrest or conviction.

This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com . To receive TomDispatch in your inbox three times a week, click here .
Charles W. Engelhard, Jr., was “ the platinum king ” of South Africa (and was evidently the model for Ian Fleming’s James Bond nemesis Goldfinger). He lived mainly in a “Rhinelike castle, turrets and all,” in Far Hills, New Jersey, but did shuttle via his own fleet of aircraft among four other palatial homes in Johannesburg, South Africa, Boca Grande, Florida, the Gaspé Peninsula, Canada, and the Waldorf Towers in my hometown, New York City, and he had business dealings in 50 countries. He was not my father.
My dad, Charles L. Engelhardt, known all his life as “Len” for his middle name, “Leonard,” lived in a rent-controlled apartment at 40 East 58th Street in Manhattan that he and my mother had found after he was demobilized from World War II. For part of my childhood, he shuttled between there and the gas station he ran on Governor’s Island, an Army base just off the southern tip of Manhattan — until, for a terrible period in the golden 1950s, he was largely out of work and shuttled between nowhere (except possibly bars and home).
Still, I did manage to cross paths with the other Charles, the incredibly rich one, several times in my life. There was that moment when his wife’s hat bill was mistakenly delivered to our house in the worst of economic times and my dad briefly went nuts. There was the butcher in my neighborhood decades later who, if I gave him a check, always said with a little mischievous smile, “Engelhardt… I should have invested in platinum when I had the chance!” And there was, of course, Yale, my personal introduction to big-time inequality in a society that, compared to the present gilded age described so vividly by TomDispatch regular Rajan Menon today, would look like a nirvana of economic equality .
At the time, Yale was still a prime staging ground for the WASP elite. I was a Jewish kid from New York applying (under pressure from my Charles Engelhardt, who saw it as the upward-mobile route to another universe) just at the moment when that school was finally removing its quotas on Jews. That was in every way another age. With the recent set of scandals over college admissions in mind, I was certainly typical in 1961 when I simply walked into my SAT tests one day — no preparation, no courses beforehand, no tutors , no special payments , little understanding of what they even were. Later that year, I had an interview with some Yale alum and bumped into the other Charles for the last time. I no longer remember the context, but my interviewer somehow brought up that Engelhard (no “t”) and ever after I wondered whether he had confused the scions of two very unequal Engelhard(t) families. (It’s unlikely, since I got into Yale off the waiting list and went there — to my deep disappointment– under strong pressure from my parents who could, then, ill afford it.)
And that was how my introduction to what inequality meant in this country began. Keep in mind that I attended Yale with George W. Bush and what seemed like a bevy of other George W.s, future CEOs standing around beer kegs. Despite a genuinely fine education, when I left, I felt like I had been freed from jail and yet, as Menon points out today, when it comes to gilded ages and gilded cages, those of more than half a century ago were pikers compared to the present moment.

Money Talks, Big Time By Rajan Menon
Despair about the state of our politics pervades the political spectrum, from left to right. One source of it, the narrative of fairness offered in basic civics textbooks — we all have an equal opportunity to succeed if we work hard and play by the rules; citizens can truly shape our politics — no longer rings true to most Americans. Recent surveys indicate that substantial numbers of them believe that the economy and political system are both rigged. They also think that money has an outsized influence on politics. Ninety percent of Democrats hold this view, but so do 80% of Republicans. And careful studies confirm what the public believes.
None of this should be surprising given the stark economic inequality that now marks our society. The richest 1% of American households currently account for 40% of the country’s wealth, more than the bottom 90% of families possess. Worse yet, the top 0.1% has cornered about 20% of it, up from 7% in the mid-1970s. By contrast, the share of the bottom 90% has since then fallen from 35% to 25%. To put such figures in a personal light, in 2017, three men — Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, and Bill Gates — possessed more wealth ($248.5 billion) than the bottom 50% of Americans.
Over the last four decades, economic disparities in the U.S. increased substantially and are now greater than those in other wealthy democracies. The political consequence has been that a tiny minority of extremely wealthy Americans wields disproportionate influence, leaving so many others feeling disempowered.
What Money Sounds Like
Two recent headline-producing scandals highlight money’s power in society and politics.
The first involved super-affluent parents who used their wealth to get their manifestly unqualified children into highly selective colleges and universities that previously had reputations (whatever the reality) for weighing the merits of applicants above their parents’ wealth or influence.
The second concerned Texas Senator Ted Cruz’s reported failure to reveal, as election laws require, more than $1 million in low-interest loans that he received for his 2012 Senate campaign. (For that lapse, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) fined Senator Cruz a modest $35,000.) The funds came from Citibank and Goldman Sachs, the latter his wife’s longtime employer. News of those undisclosed loans, which also cast doubt on Cruz’s claim that he had funded his campaign in part by liquidating the couple’s assets, only added to the sense that favoritism now suffuses the politics of a country that once prided itself on being the world’s model democracy. (Journalists covering the story couldn’t resist pointing out that the senator had often lambasted Wall Street’s “ crony capitalism ” and excessive political influence.)
The Cruz controversy is just one reflection of the coming of 1% politics and 1% elections to America at a moment when the first billionaire has been ensconced in the Oval Office for more than two years, posing as a populist no less.
Since the Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , money has poured into politics as never before. That’s because the Court ruled that no limits could be placed on corporate and union spending aimed at boosting or attacking candidates running for political office. Doing so, the justices determined in a 5-4 vote, would be tantamount to restricting individuals’ right to free speech, protected by the First Amendment . Then came the Court’s 2014 McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission decision (again 5-4), which only increased money’s influence in politics by removing the aggregate limit on an individual’s contribution to candidates and to national party committees.
In an age when money drives politics, even ex-presidents are cashing in. Fifteen years after Bill Clinton departed the White House, he and Hillary had amassed a net worth of $75 million — a 6,150% increase in their wealth. Barack and Michelle Obama’s similarly soared from $1.3 million in 2000 to $40 million last year — and they’re just warming up. Key sources of these staggering increases include sky-high speaking fees (often paid by large corporations), including $153 million for the Clintons between February 2001 and May 2016. George W. Bush also made tens of millions of dollars in this fashion and, in 2017, Obama received $400,000 for a single speech to a Wall Street firm.
No wonder average Americans believe that the political class is disconnected from their day-to-day lives and that ours is, in practice, a democracy of the rich in which money counts (and counts and counts).
Cash for College
Now let’s turn to what those two recent scandals tell us about the nexus between wealth and power in America.
First, the school scam. Parents have long hired pricey tutors to coach their children for the college admissions tests, sometimes paying them hundreds of dollars an hour, even $1,500 for 90 minutes of high-class prep. They’ve also long tapped their exclusive social and political connections to gin up razzle-dazzle internships to embellish those college applications. Anyone who has spent as much time in academia as I have knows that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time. So has the practice of “ legacy admissions ” — access to elite schools especially for the kids of alumni of substantial means who are, or might prove to be, donors . The same is true of privileged access to elite schools for the kids of mega-donors. Consider, for instance, that $2.5 million donation Charles Kushner made to Harvard in 1998, not long before his son Jared applied. Some of the folks who ran Jared’s high school noted that he wasn’t exactly a whiz-bang student or someone with sky-high SAT scores, but — surprise! — he was accepted anyway.
What’s new about the recent revelations is that they show the extent to which today’s deep-pocketed helicopter parents have gone into overdrive, using brazen schemes to corrupt the college admissions process yet more. One unnamed parent spent a cool $6.5 million to ensure the right college admitted his or her child. Others paid hefty amounts to get their kids’ college admissions test scores falsified or even hired proxies to take the tests for them. Famous actors and financial titans made huge payments to university sports coaches, who then lied to admissions officers, claiming that the young applicants were champions they had recruited in sports like water polo, crew, or tennis. (The kids may have known how to swim, row, or play tennis, but star athletes they were not .)
Of course, as figures on the growing economic inequality in this country since the 1970s indicate, the overwhelming majority of Americans lack the connections or the cash to stack the deck in such ways, even assuming they would do so. Hence, the public outrage, even though parents generally understand that not every aspirant can get into a top school — there aren’t enough spots — just as many know that their childrens’ future happiness and sense of fulfillment won’t depend on whether they attend a prestigious college or university.
Still, the unfairness and chicanery highlighted by the admissions scandal proved galling, the more so as the growing crew of fat cats corrupting the admissions process doubtless also preach the gospel of American meritocracy. Worse, most of their kids will undoubtedly present their fancy degrees as proof that quality wins out in our society, never mind that their starting blocks were placed so far ahead of the competition.
To add insult to injury, the same parents and children may even portray admissions policies designed to help students who lack wealth or come from underrepresented communities as violations of the principles of equal opportunity and fairness, democracy’s bedrock. In reality, students from low-income families, or even those of modest means, are startlingly less likely to be admitted to top private universities than those from households in the top 10%. In fact, applicants from families in the top 1% are now 77 times more likely than in the bottom 20% to land in an elite college, and 38 of those schools admit more kids from families in that top percentage than from the bottom 60%.
Buying Politics (and Politicians), American-Style
Now, let’s return to the political version of the same — the world in which Ted Cruz swims so comfortably. There, too, money talks, which means that those wealthy enough to gain access to, and the attention of, lawmakers have huge advantages over others. If you want political influence, whether as a person or a corporation, having the wealth needed to make big campaign contributions — to individuals or groups — and to hire top-drawer lobbyists makes a world of difference.
Official data on the distribution of family income in the United States show that the overwhelming majority of Americans can’t play that game, which remains the preserve of a tiny super-rich minority. In 2015, even with taxes and government-provided benefits included, households in the lowest 20% accounted for only about 5% of total income. Their average income — not counting taxes and government-provided assistance — was only $20,000. The share of the bottom 50% — families making $61,372 or less — dropped from 20% to 12% between 1978 and 2015. By contrast, families in the top 1% earned nearly 50% of total income, averaging $215,000 a year — and that’s only income, not wealth. The super-rich have plenty of the latter, those in the bottom 20% next to none.
Before we proceed, a couple of caveats about money and political clout. Money doesn’t always prevail. Candidates with more campaign funds aren’t guaranteed victory, though the time politicians spend raising cash leaves no doubt that they believe it makes a striking difference. In addition, money in politics doesn’t operate the way simple bribery does. The use of it in pursuit of political influence works more subtly, and often — in the new era opened by the Supreme Court — without the slightest need to violate the law.
Still, in Donald Trump’s America, who would claim that money doesn’t talk? If nothing else, from inaugural events — for Trump’s inaugural $107 million was raised from a host of wealthy donors with no limits on individual payments, 30 of which totaled $1 million or more — to gala fundraisers, big donors get numerous opportunities to schmooze with those whose campaigns they’ve helped bankroll. Yes, there’s a limit — currently $5,600 — on how much any individual can officially give to a single election campaign, but the ultra-wealthy can simply put their money into organizations formed solely to influence elections as well as into various party committees.
Individuals, companies, and organizations can, for instance, give money to political action committees (PACs) and Super PACs. Though bound by rules , both entities still have lots of leeway. PACs face no monetary limits on their independent efforts to shape elections, though they can’t accept corporate or union money or take more than $5,000 from individuals. They can provide up to $5,000 to individual election campaigns and $15,000 per party committee, but there’s no limit on what they can contribute in the aggregate. Super PACs have far more running room. They can rake in unlimited amounts from a variety of sources (as long as they’re not foreign) and, like PACs, can spend limitless sums to shape elections, providing they don’t give money directly to candidates’ campaigns.
Then there are the dark money groups, which can receive financial contributions from any source, American or foreign. Though their primary purpose is to push policies, not individual campaigns, they can engage in election-related work, provided that no more than half their funds are devoted to it. Though barred from donating to individual campaigns, they can pour unlimited money into Super PACs and, unlike PACs and Super PACs, don’t have to disclose who gave them the money or how much. Between 2008 and 2018, dark money groups spent $1 billion to influence elections.
In 2018 , 2,395 Super PACs were working their magic in this country. They raised $1.6 billion and spent nearly $809 million. Nearly 78% of the money they received came from 100 donors . They, in turn, belonged to the wealthiest 1%, who provided 95% of what those Super PACs took in.
As the 2018 congressional elections kicked off, the four wealthiest Super PACs alone had $113.4 million on hand to support candidates they favored, thanks in substantial measure to business world donors. In that election cycle, 31 individuals ponied up more than $5 million apiece, while contributions from the top four among them ranged from almost $40 million to $123 million.
The upshot: if you’re running for office and advocate policies disliked by wealthy individuals or by companies and organizations with lots of cash to drop into politics, you know from the get-go that you now have a problem.
Wealth also influences political outcomes through the lobbying industry. Here again, there are rules, but even so, vast numbers of lobbyists and eye-popping amounts of lobbying money now are at the heart of the American political system. In 2018 alone , the 50 biggest lobbying outfits, largely representing big companies, business associations, and banks, spent $540 million, and the grand total for lobbying that year alone was $3.4 billion.
Nearly 350 of those lobbyists were former legislators from Congress. Officials departing from senior positions in the executive branch have also found artful ways to circumvent presidential directives that prohibit them from working as lobbyists for a certain number of years.
Do unions and public interest groups also lobby? Sure, but there’s no contest between them and corporations. Lee Drutman of the New America think tank notes that, for every dollar the former spent in 2015, corporate donors spent $34. Unsurprisingly, only one of the top 20 spenders on lobbying last year was a union or a public-interest organization.
The sums spent by individual companies to gain political influence can be breathtaking. Take now-embattled Boeing . It devoted $15 million to lobbying in 2018 — and that’s not counting its campaign contributions, using various channels. Those added another $8.4 million in the last two-and-a-half years. Yet Boeing only placed 11th among the top 20 corporate spenders on lobbying last year. Leading the pack: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at $94.8 million.
Defenders of the status quo will warn that substantially reducing money’s role in American politics is sure to threaten democracy and civil liberties by ceding undue power to the state and, horror of horrors, putting us on the road to “socialism,” the right wing’s bogeyman du jour . This is ludicrous. Other democracies have taken strong steps to prevent economic inequality from subverting their politics and haven’t become less free as a result. Even those democracies that don’t limit political contributions have adopted measures to curb the power of money, including bans on television ads (a huge expense for candidates in American elections: $3 billion in 2018 alone just for access to local stations), free airtime to allow competitors to disseminate their messages, and public funds to ease the financial burden of election campaigns. Compared to other democracies, the United States appears to be in a league of its own when it comes to money’s prominence in politics.
Those who favor continuing business as usual like to point out that federal “matching funds” exist to help presidential candidates not be steamrolled by competitors who’ve raised mounds of money. Those funds, however, do no such thing because they come with stringent limits on total spending. Candidates who accept matching funds for a general election cannot accept contributions from individuals. Moreover, matching funds are capped at $20 million, which is a joke considering that Barack Obama and Mitt Romney spent a combined $1.2 billion in individual contributions alone during the 2012 presidential election. ( Super PACs spent another $350 million to help Romney and $100 million to back Obama.)
A New American Tradition?
Rising income inequality , wage stagnation , and slowing social mobility hurt ordinary Americans economically, even as they confer massive social and political advantages on the mega-rich — and not just when it comes to college admissions and politics either.
Even the Economist , a publication that can’t be charged with sympathy for left-wing ideas, warned recently of the threat economic inequality poses to the political agency of American citizens. The magazine cited studies showing that, despite everything you’ve heard about the power of small donations in recent political campaigns, 1% of the population actually provides a quarter of all the money spent on politics by individuals and 80% of what the two major political parties raise. Thanks to their wealth, a minuscule economic elite as well as big corporations now shape policies, notably on taxation and expenditure, to their advantage on an unprecedented scale. Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Americans support stricter laws to prevent wealth from hijacking politics and want the Citizens United ruling overturned . But then just how much does the voice of the majority matter? Judging from the many failed efforts to pass such laws, not much.

Remarks at a UN Security Council Briefing on Non-proliferation,usun.state.gov,stanforda,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://usun.state.gov/remarks/9006,"Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security U.S. Department of State April
Thank you Foreign Minister Maas for convening this crucial meeting today on supporting the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or NPT. I’d also like to thank Under-Secretary-General Nakamitsu and Director General Amano for their briefings today.
Mr. President, the Security Council tackles some of the greatest challenges to international peace and security. But perhaps no challenge is more potent or more relevant to all of us than the further proliferation of nuclear weapons.
We’re approaching the 50th anniversary of the entry into force of the NPT. Over nearly five decades the NPT has grown even more critical to the maintenance of international peace and security. It has made us all more secure by constraining the spread of nuclear weapons, and has also thereby enabled the global peaceful use of nuclear energy and helped create conditions for progress on nuclear disarmament.
Fifty years ago, few would have dared to predict that we would be here today celebrating the success of the NPT.
Before the NPT, U.S. Government National Intelligence Estimates, the NIEs, expressed dire concern about a possible snowball effect of cascading proliferation, which would increase the world’s nuclear stockpile and undermine confidence in the ability of nonproliferation policies to prevent such an action.
Yet in a demonstration of remarkable diplomatic resolve, the international community joined together against this collective threat, reflecting rare consensus during a time of Cold War polarization. Diplomatic efforts culminated in the negotiation and entry into force of the NPT.
There’s been unwavering international consensus about the indispensable role of the Treaty to collective peace and security.
The NPT has succeeded for half a century because it serves the fundamental and widely-recognized common interest of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
We have also seen enormous disarmament progress, in part because the NPT helped curtail the emergence of new nuclear powers. With the easing of Cold War tensions and the success of the NPT-based nonproliferation regime in impeding proliferation, it’s been possible to reduce the nuclear arsenals of both the United States and Russia to levels not seen since the 1950s. The U.S. stockpile today has been reduced to approximately 12 percent of its Cold War peak.
We must also recognize that advancing towards the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons must take into account the global security environment. We cannot overlook the fact that the actions of those states that are expanding and modernizing their nuclear stockpiles, threatening their neighbors, and violating their arms control obligations have contributed to a deterioration in global security conditions.
My esteemed colleagues, the United States is in the process of developing implementation plans for a path breaking new initiative, “Creating an Environment for Nuclear Disarmament” or CEND. This initiative is aimed at bringing countries together in a constructive dialogue exploring ways in which it might be possible to ameliorate conditions in the global security environment so as to make possible the more conducive and further progress towards — and indeed, ultimately to achieve — nuclear disarmament.
In this respect, as well as its emphasis upon dialogue and diplomatic engagement with all relevant parties, the CEND initiative stands in stark contrast to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons or the Ban Treaty. The Ban Treaty fails to address the security challenges that continue to make nuclear deterrence necessary, and it seeks to stigmatize, rather than engage with, countries that rely upon nuclear deterrence for their national security.
As we turn towards the 2020 Review Conference or RevCon, the United States seeks a positive outcome from that meeting that reflects consensus on as broad a basis as possible. We believe consensus is possible if NPT Parties focus on the big picture, emphasizing their common interests and avoiding using divisive issues, such as the Ban Treaty and a Middle East WMD-free zone, to hold the RevCon hostage.
To strengthen the NPT and the nonproliferation regime, states must support universalization of the IAEA Additional Protocol or AP, which has become the de facto nuclear safeguards standard, and makes the AP a condition of nuclear supply.
States must also be united in demanding the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea. They must also continue to hold that a secure and peaceful and bright future is possible for North Korea if it fulfills its commitments. And we must remain united in our determination that Iran must never acquire a pathway to nuclear weapons.
The 2020 NPT Review Conference will also be an opportunity to highlight how the NPT and the broader nuclear nonproliferation regime have made possible thriving international cooperation on peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science, and technology. We aim to build on that success.
We’re optimistic that the NPT will endure, yet this outcome is far from guaranteed. We now must continue to preserve and strengthen the NPT so that, 50 years from now, our successors may mark the hundredth anniversary of the Treaty and an enduring accomplishment that continues to promote international security and prosperity.
Thank you very much, Mr. President. ###"
Remarks at the Adoption of a UN General Assembly Resolution on Combating Terrorism and Other Acts of Violence Based on Religion or Belief,usun.state.gov,skieran,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://usun.state.gov/remarks/9005,"U.S. Mission to the United Nations New York City April
Madam Chairperson, ministers, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, I’m honored to join you today at the adoption of this resolution on combating terrorism and other acts of violence based on religion or belief. We offer our thanks to Turkey for taking the initiative to bring us together for this timely and important discussion.
Before I begin, we offer our condolences to the people and the government of New Zealand in the wake of the horrific terrorist attacks on the Muslim community in Christchurch last month. We stand in solidarity with the people of New Zealand and their government against this act of hate. As Secretary of State Pompeo said, “no one should have to fear such violence in their place of worship.” Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the victims and families of the attack.
The mosque attacks in Christchurch were a powerful reminder to all of us that terrorism knows no bounds, holds no one ideology, and that no part of the world is immune from its unacceptable and repugnant expression of hate. Many of us in this room represent nations whose people have been the victims of terrorist attacks. Americans know all too well the pain of such attacks, most recently with the attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. The Yazidis and Christians victimized by ISIS also know this pain. Opposing this terrorism unites countries around the world.
While we’ve made progress in our fight against terrorism, we must remain vigilant. Together, we must continue to fight terrorism in all its forms wherever it exists. Organized terrorist groups are coordinating and conducting attacks around the world. In this context, keeping people safe from terrorism requires a coordinated whole-of-society strategy that includes defeating violent ideologies, preventing terrorist radicalization, and when possible, rehabilitating those who have been committed to violent extremism. Governments cannot do this alone. Civil society and private sector must also be part of the solution.
The U.S. government is committed to preventing and countering violent extremism. The White House recently released the National Strategy for Counterterrorism, which stresses the importance of public communications and diplomacy to strengthen partnerships in civil society. Creating successful prevention and de-radicalization architecture requires putting in place policies and programs to confront the influence of radical terrorist ideologies. This means building local resilience to ideologies that are discriminatory, exclusionary, and intolerant through inclusive, rights-respecting governance and education that develops critical thinking and respect for the religious and cultural practices of others. In addition, it means promoting credible voices that have the authority and legitimacy to discredit those of terrorists and radicalizers.
This is not easy. We face a complex, diffuse, and formidable global threat, but with partnerships, international cooperation, hard work, and commitment, we can, and we must, achieve sustained victory in our shared fight against terrorism.
I thank you for your attention. ###"

I went to vote this afternoon, arriving at my polling place around 5:00pm. Judging by the number of voters that had already voted in my precinct and typical voting patterns the total turnout should be around 50%. Early voting and absentee voting may push it a little higher. The citywide turnout is anticipated to be around 30%.
That is incredibly disappointing. Thirty years ago 90% turnouts citywide were not unheard of. I don’t know how to interpret such a low degree of civic engagement. I don’t know whether it’s just plain disinterest, being overwhelmed with the coverage, phone calls, etc., or despair. Maybe some of all three.
I also don’t know who that low a turnout will benefit."

I’m sorry to say that I found the prescriptions Micah Goodman’s piece at Atlantic , “Eight Steps to Shrink the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict”, terribly dissatisfying. The only conclusion I think one could take away from it was that the author believes that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be “shrunk” by actions on the part of the Israelis alone. I guess that’s right—the conflict would be “shrunk” to that part of the conflict for which Palestinians are responsible. The author does not even suggest the possibility that the measures he wants to be put in place are a consequence of bad behavior on the part of the Palestinians rather than their cause.
What do you think would happen if all of the measures he proposes are implemented in full? Would it reduce the number of terrorist attacks against Israelis by Palestinians? Would it reduce the number of missiles being lobbed at Israelis? I don’t believe that for a second.
What would happen if the Palestinians ended their campaign of violence against the Israelis? I think that over time the Israelis would relax the restrictions they’ve imposed and over time Israelis would come into ownership of Gaza and the West Bank by purchasing them."
Lewis’s “Magic Formula”,theglitteringeye.com,Dave Schuler,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://theglitteringeye.com/lewiss-magic-formula/,"April 2, 2019
Nathan Lewis explains his “magic formula” for promoting prosperity at Forbes :
Economics is easy. You just have to get two things right: Low Taxes, and Stable Money. Get this right, and everything else tends to follow with relative ease. Get it wrong, and the endless problems and difficulties that ensue will prove insoluble.
I like to call it “the Magic Formula.” If it seems obvious, that’s because it is. Capitalist economies don’t really work very well when taxes are high or money is unstable. Nevertheless, the Magic Formula is often ignored. Taxes today are not very low; money is not very stable; both might get worse, not better. This has consequences.
I think his formula is broken. It assumes a higher level of consumption relative to income for the wealthy than presently exists and lower importants than we presently have. Otherwise the formula may bring prosperity—just not here.
Most incremental income has been going to the wealthiest for decades. The wealthiest aren’t spending their money bigger houses, more cars, or large staffs of servants or, more precisely, they aren’t just spending their money on bigger houses, more cars, or large staffs of servants. They put their money into stocks, bonds, T-bills and other financial assets. Very little of that seeps into the real economy of goods and services so none of us ever see it.
And when much of what you consume (other than health care and education) is manufactured somewhere other than the United States, consumption does not have as great a multiplier effect here as when we made things here.
For the “magic formula” to start working again it will take more than low taxes and stable prices. It will altering the distribution of income and imposing the same costs due to labor and environmental regulations on goods made elsewhere as apply to good made here.
I’m not opposed to low taxes and stable prices. I just want the prosperity that they will promote to be spread around a little more."

At The Hill Nolan Rappaport outlines some measures that would be more effective at stemming the tide of migrants from Central America to our border. His first point is one that had not occurred to me—remittances going to Central America are far larger than our foreign aid to Central America:
In 2017, migrants from the Northern Triangle who work in the United States sent billions of dollars home to their families. These remittances totaled more than $5 billion for El Salvador, $4 billion for Honduras, and $8.68 billion for Guatemala. This was 20.1 percent of the Gross Domestic Product in El Salvador, 17.4 percent in Honduras, and 11.5 percent in Guatemala.
What is the aid supposed to do?
In 2016, the United States gave $131.2 million in aid to Guatemala, $98.3 million to Honduras, and $67.9 million to El Salvador, and Congress has appropriated about $2.1 billion for the program since then.
I’m skeptical that our foreign aid to Central America is doing much good for the people there. I think it’s mostly being siphoned off by elites in those countries.
Other measures proposed by Mr. Rappaport include: Appeal the Flores Settlement Agreement to the Supreme Court. The Flores agreement is what prohibits the administration from holding migrants in detention longer. Process persecution claims outside of the U.S. Eliminate the exploitation magnet, i.e. tighter workplace enforcement of labor regulations.
In other words the primary effect of cutting aid may be to put pressure on elites to curb emigration. If it’s tight enough it may be worthwhile. I continue to believe that a bigger, stouter wall will only be of limited effectiveness, mostly serving to change the composition of the migrants rather than to prevent illegal entry.
But there are other, more cost-effective measures that deserve consideration."
