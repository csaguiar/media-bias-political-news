Matt Gaetz for ... US Senate?,floridapolitics.com,Peter Schorsch,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://floridapolitics.com/archives/292547-matt-gaetz-for-us-senate,"
on April 3, 2019 Maybe you read that Republican U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz wanted to be Florida‚Äôs Attorney General . Well, that was so 10 minutes ago. We sleuthed around and discovered he may have a better plan: Running for the U.S. Senate. No, he‚Äôs not planning to oust U.S. Sens. Rick Scott or Marco Rubio , despite his reported distaste for the former. He‚Äôs eyeing Alabama. Wait, wait, don‚Äôt leave yet. Here‚Äôs why this scheme is not as crazy or harebrained as you may first imagine. First of all, it is ri-donk-ulously easy to qualify for the office there. You have to be at least 30 years old, a registered voter in the state and, oh, there‚Äôs a residency requirement of one day. One. Day. Honestly, this is a good way to jump in for Gaetz, who now represents the Panhandle (that‚Äôs almost Alabama, right?). Alabama has a runoff and there will be a multicandidate primary. President Donald Trump could well be very helpful in introducing him. The Prez isn‚Äôt crazy about his options there to date, as none were nearly as effusive in backing him as Gaetz. The kicker: Gaetz tells us he ‚Äúmay have mentioned‚Äù the idea of running in ‚ÄòBama to some people ‚Äúin passing.‚Äù Will a Gaetz Senate candidacy fly in the ‚ÄúThe Heart of Dixie?‚Äù He‚Äôll never know ‚Ä¶ until he tries. Or, you know, polls. Share this: "

Ramos said Americans have to understand that 300,000 to a million illegal immigrants have entered the United States every year for decades and if more ‚Äúof these immigrants want to come to the United States, it is very difficult to stop them at the border.‚Äù Ramos added that ‚ÄúCentral American countries and Mexico are not the immigration police of Donald Trump‚Äù and insisted that no matter how much money is spent trying to solve the migrant crisis, governments ‚Äúsimply don‚Äôt have the power to stop that from becoming reality.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut the truth is that, Anderson, nobody can stop them,‚Äù Ramos said. ‚ÄúNobody can really stop them.‚Äù
Ramos, the amnesty advocate who has said that the United States has a responsibility to ‚Äúabsorb‚Äù the caravan migrants, made his remarks just a week after Border Patrol officials announced that they are seeing the ‚Äúhighest total of apprehensions and encounters in over a decade.‚Äù
President Donald Trump will head to the border town of Calexico, California, on Friday and has threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border if Mexico does not do more to curb the migrant caravans. This weekend, Trump announced that he will be cutting off aid to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, but Ramos said doing so will only encourage more migrants to trek to the United States.
Nobody likes illegal immigration. Nobody. So let‚Äôs do something about it: first, legalize the 10.7 M undocumented immigrants that are already here; second, create a legal and realistic immigration system that works. This won‚Äôt be solved with a useless wall. #WallsDon ‚ÄôtWork
‚Äî JORGE RAMOS (@jorgeramosnews) February 6, 2019
Earlier this year, Ramos called for the legalization of all the country‚Äôs illegal immigrations while saying that the border wall is a ‚Äúsymbol of hate and racism‚Äù for ‚Äúthose who want to make America white again.‚Äù He has also insisted that Americans must ‚Äúaccept‚Äù that the U.S.-Mexico border is ‚Äúnothing more than an invention.‚Äù

What is the incentive for becoming a citizen? üíØ %
You have two families: ""Citizen Joe"" and ""Undocumented George"". Both families have two parents, two children, and live in just about any Major US city !. Joe works in construction, has a Social Security Number and makes $25.00 per hour with taxes deducted. Undocumented George also works in construction, has NO Social Security Number, and gets paid $15.00 cash ""under the table.""
Ready? Now pay attention....
Citizen Joe: $25.00 per hour x 40 hours = $1000.00 per week, or $52,000.00 per year. Now take 30% away for state and federal tax. Joe now has $31,231.00.
Undocumented George: $15.00 per hour x 40 hours = $600.00 per week, or $31,200.00 per year. George pays no taxes. George now has $31,200.00.
Citizen Joe pays medical and dental insurance with limited coverage for his family at $600.00 per month, or $7,200.00 per year. Joe now has $24,031.00.
Undocumented George has full medical and dental coverage through the state and local clinics at a cost of $0.00 per year. George still has $31,200.00.
Citizen Joe makes too much money and is not eligible for food stamps or welfare. Joe pays $500.00 per month for food, or $6,000.00 per year. Joe now has $18,031.00.
Undocumented George has no documented income and is eligible for food stamps, welfare, and other social programs. George still has $31,200.00.
Citizen Joe pays rent of $1,200.00 per month, or $14,400.00 per year. Joe now has $9,631.00.
Undocumented George receives a $500.00 per month federal rent subsidy,...which pays 80% of his rent George pays out that $500.00 per month, ....or $6,000.00 per year George still has $ 31,200.00.
Citizen Joe pays $200.00 per month, or $2,400.00 for auto insurance. Joe now has $7,231.00.
Undocumented George says, ""We don't need no stinkin' insurance!"" and still has $31,200.00.
Citizen Joe now works overtime on Saturdays or gets a part-time job after work.
Undocumented George has nights and weekends off to enjoy with his family.
Citizen Joe and Undocumented George‚Äôs children both attend the same school. Joe pays for his children's lunches, while George‚Äôs children get a government sponsored lunch.
Citizen Joe has to make his $7,231.00 stretch to pay utilities, gas, living expenses. Undocumented George has $31,200.00 to pay utilities, gas, and what he sends out of the country every month.
Citizen Joe, works hard, does the right thing, and is barely able to live above the poverty level. Undocumented George with his free government entitlements makes $65,000.00 a year CASH and lives tax free!
Undocumented George has NO Incentive...to become a legal citizen !

Video: The Chicago Fire: America at Its Best,patriotpost.us,Media Editors,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://patriotpost.us/articles/62141-video-the-chicago-fire-america-at-its-best,"Video: The Chicago Fire: America at Its Best
It's not the Oct. 8, 1871 fire that was so remarkable; it's what happened afterwards. Media Editors ¬∑ Apr. 3, 2019
The most famous fire in American history happened in Chicago on October 8, 1871. But it‚Äôs not the fire that is so remarkable. It‚Äôs what happened afterwards. To understand why, we first need to know something about the city‚Äôs history.
In 1840, Chicago was a small town of forty-five hundred souls. It ranked 92nd in population in the United States. Yet, only three decades later, by 1870 ‚Äî just a year before the great fire ‚Äî Chicago was closing in on a population of 300,000, making it the fifth-biggest city in America and the fastest-growing city in the world.
What led to all this rapid growth? In three words: location, location, location.
‚ÄúChicago was near the center of the country, and near where the waterways and railways met,‚Äù city historian Tim Samuelson notes. ‚ÄúIt was a perfect place for anything and anyone to get anywhere‚Ä¶‚Äù
Timing had a lot to do with it, too. America was moving from a rural to an industrial power. Chicago was right in the middle of the action. Ironically, its rapid growth was almost its undoing. ‚Äú[Chicago] had to build, and build quickly, and so they built it out of wood,‚Äù explained Sarah Marcus of the Chicago History Museum. ‚ÄúIt was quick, it was easy, and it was cheap.‚Äù
And, as it turned out, very flammable.
By most accounts, the fire started on the city‚Äôs West Side, near the De Koven Street barn of Patrick and Catherine O'Leary. No one is sure of the cause, but it could have been anything, from vandals to a drunken neighbor to that clumsy cow of urban legend.
Within minutes, the blaze roared out of control, tearing through Chicago‚Äôs business district. The fire was so hot, it created its own tornado of flame. By 3:30 a.m., all hope of saving large parts of the city was gone. Nearly 30 hours later, the fire finally died. The reason? There was nothing left to burn.
The losses were staggering: The fire claimed nearly 300 lives, destroyed over 17,000 buildings covering almost 3.5 square miles, and caused damage of over $200 million-about 3.8 billion today. Roughly a third of the city lay in ruins, and one out every three people living in Chicago ‚Äî nearly 100,000 residents ‚Äî became homeless overnight.
‚ÄúAll the law offices were destroyed, all the major hotels were destroyed, all the major department stores were destroyed, and all the major banks were destroyed,‚Äù Chicago weather historian Tom Skilling notes.
In those days, there were no national or state agencies to help. Chicago was on its own.
What was to be done? To most of Chicago‚Äôs citizens, the answer was obvious: Rebuild. Make the city better than ever. Yes, there were many victims of the fire, but there was no sense of victimhood. Even before the bricks stopped smoking, the people of Chicago went to work.
First, the damage had to be assessed. The death and destruction were obvious. But there were some major pluses as well. The stockyards and meat packing plants had been spared. Two-thirds of the grain elevators survived. And most importantly, the railway and rail stock escaped major damage. This was critical because it would allow shipments of building materials and private relief aid to come pouring in from across the country and around the world.
The banking community quickly rallied. Within 48 hours, 12 of the 29 banks that had burned to the ground were operating in makeshift facilities. Merchants ‚Äî large and small ‚Äî immediately set up temporary shops. Local financier Henry Greenbaum sent letters to investment bankers all over the globe. This wasn‚Äôt the time to give up on the city; it was the time, he told them, to buy in. Many agreed.
Among them were creative young architects attracted to the nearly blank slate the city presented to them. They would raise a new city from a new product: steel. Their work, praised and copied all over the world, came to be known as the Chicago School.
By 1890, only 20 years after the fire, Chicago‚Äôs population passed the one-million mark, becoming the second-biggest city in America. The population had more than tripled since the Windy City‚Äôs darkest night.
Why is this all important to know? Because the government didn‚Äôt rebuild Chicago. Chicago rebuilt Chicago. And with astonishing speed and energy. A can-do spirit, devotion to community and free-market capitalism made it happen. It‚Äôs impossible to look at this achievement without admiration ‚Äî and more than a bit of nostalgia.
Could we summon that same spirit today?
Yes. We can. But only if we proudly retell stories like this one that remind us the greatness of America is not a product of government, but a product of self-government ‚Äî empowered citizens pursuing their own best interests.

I agree with racism and the welfare state. Racism is natural it is built in to your DNA for survival to accept only your tribe or like tribe. Welfare system at least in monetary terms is completely man made and yes it forces large portion's of the population to be dependent on the state. Which gives the state complete control over their lives.
Breakdown of the family I believe is dependent on various factors. State dependency being one of them, intelligence, race and basically the issue with the human which is extremely fallible.
Change is inevitable. There will always be change with technological advances.

So called ‚Äúfree love‚Äù was the norm in Soviet society as was abortion. But you miss the point. The Marxists are very happy to allow everything and anything to destroy the culture they hate , they will encourage anything to reduce that society to chaos. Once the have obtained power in society ,or taken over the old culture they will only allow what they think will strengthen their state. The Soviets didn‚Äôt encourage student demonstrations or speaking out against the establishment but they not only encourage it but organise it in the society they want to destroy. To them the ends justifies the means.
You mention party connections ; the whole of Soviet society operated on what was called ‚Äúblat‚Äù ; everyone strove to cultivate the acquaintance of a powerful Communist official in order to obtain a better life from the system.
The approach to homosexuality was not uniform throughout the Soviet Union. Stalin re-criminalised it partly because it was seen as a Bourgeois practice. But as I say , what Marxists do when in power does not often reflect what they do when agitating to destroy a capitalist society. Obviously when in power they will only do what they feel strengthens their Soviet society. This really proves what a really nasty ,hypocritical bunch they are. In the late 1930s the abortion laws were tightened but it was after the great loss of life in the war that the state really cracked down on abortion and honoured Motherhood and family. Proving yet again that what they do to uphold a communist society is totally different to what they want to do to destabilize a Capitaist society."

The organization of life arises when an oportunity to create entropy is available. It's a similar process to the creation of tropical cyclones. The Sun provides abundant energy for order to arise and create entropy. Like most creationists though you will likely stick your fingers in your ears and say ""I don't believe it! Order cannot arise from disorder!"" It most definitely can happen when energy is available.
Even if we didn't know the answer though the existence of God is in no way evident. You make a classic god of the gaps argument: ""we don't know; therefore, God!""

MUENSTER - A court in Germany has closed the trial against a 95-year-old former guard at a Nazi death camp because of the defendant's health problems, almost certainly ending one of the last such Holocaust prosecutions.The defendant, a German who cannot be named for legal reasons, is now considered permanently unfit to stand trial, the court in the western city of Muenster said on Wednesday. A medical report found that physical and cognitive constraints linked to heart and kidney problems meant the man could not follow the proceedings. The decision can be contested, the court added.However, the development suggests that the trial will be terminated for good. The court had already given prosecutors, joint plaintiffs and the defense a chance to make a statement on the underlying medical examination.The court had halted the trial in February because of the defendant's ill health and said it intended to halt it permanently.The man first appeared in court in November, accused of assisting in the murder of hundreds of people at Stutthof, a Nazi concentration camp during World War Two. A former guard in the SS paramilitary wing of Hitler's Nazis, he denied the charges.During the trial, the wheelchair-bound man told the court that he had never been a Nazi and that he was not indifferent to the suffering of inmates.The man was accused of knowing about killings between 1942 and 1944, when he served at Stutthof, near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk. About 65,000 people, including many Jews, were murdered or died there, according to the Stutthof museum's website.""People were killed with a shot in the back of the head. People were left to starve, to freeze,"" Chief Prosecutor Andreas Brendel, one of Germany's most active Nazi hunters, said in court.

Former Likud minister Gideon Sa‚Äôar defended President Reuven Rivlin from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs attacks on him on Wednesday at a Hebrew language conference in Tel Aviv that was sponsored by The Jerusalem Post Group, the parent company of the Ma'ariv newspaper and The Post.Netanyahu said in a taped conversation with Likud activists that was revealed by Channel 12 that Rivlin ‚Äúis just looking for an excuse‚Äù to appoint Blue and White leader Benny Gantz to form the government.
