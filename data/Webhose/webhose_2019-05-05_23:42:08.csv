Step 2. Pass e verify and increase fines on those that hire illegals to 5x the current level.
Step 3. Aggressively enforce those fines
Step 4. Imprison those that overstay their Visa. For every day overstayed earns 30 days in jail plus $1000 fine for each day.

Odumbo himself went on national TV no less than *twenty* times, telling the country that his scheme would lower the cost of insurance for a family of four by an average of $2500 a year. Odumbo had to pitch it himself otherwise it would never have passed! After passage and enactment, it was revealed that instead of a $2500 annual savings what happened was a $2500 annual *price hike*, with states and insurance companies leaving the ACA because it was too expensive for *everybody*, Odumbo laughed it off and said that ""we made an error when we figured these things"" and thought to leave it at that! Amazing--either stupidity or arrogance, hard to tell which! Odumbocare was a stupid scheme which richly deserved to fail. President Trump has killed the mandate--and that pretty much is that. Odumbo care offers many people $6k annual deductibles as well as stiffly higher pricing. Went over like a lead balloon for all except the (D)s in Congress who legislated themselves a *much better deal*!"
