Georgia Anne Muldrow: Tiny Desk Concert,www.npr.org,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/04/710044073/georgia-anne-muldrow-tiny-desk-concert,"Georgia Anne Muldrow is all about showing and spreading love. That fact became clear as we discussed the set list for her Tiny Desk performance. She and the band were floating the possibility of swapping the duet with her partner in music and life, Dudley Perkins with another song. But she decided it was more important to showcase their shared love on the song ""Flowers,"" originally from Perkins' 2003 album A Lil' Light.
The first song I ever heard from Georgia Anne Muldrow, back in the early 2000s, was called ""Break You Down."" The opening line spoke directly to my experience as a twentysomething coming into my own:
""Don't let them make you forget who you are
Don't let them break you down""
I later found that she wrote, produced and performed that song when she was only 17-years old. She possessed talent and perspective beyond her years and I became a fan.
Some time would pass before she eventually released her debut album, Olesi: Fragments of an Earth, in 2006. Since then, she's released well over a dozen, mostly self-produced projects. While much of her music's focus has been on the healing, preservation and education of African American people, the themes are universal: family, struggle and of course, love. The beats are a combination of J Dilla and Battlecat while her voice carries soul that sounds like it was groomed in the backwoods of Jackson, Miss. She's also made a name for herself as a collaborator with artists that include Madlib, Mos Def and Erykah Badu, with whom she introduced the notion of ""staying woke"" to the world, years before it was appropriated as a hashtag.
During her set, Muldrow performed, reworked and animated versions of the song ""Flowers,"" along with two selections from her latest album, Overload , including an extended and jazzy version of ""Ciao.""

"In 'Working,' LBJ Biographer Writer Robert Caro Explains His Process : NPR",www.npr.org,Robert A. Caro,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/708009321/in-working-writer-robert-caro-explains-his-process-and-what-drives-him,"Enlarge this image Robert Caro attends Author's Night 2017 to benefit the East Hampton Library on Aug. 12, 2017 in East Hampton, New York. Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images Robert Caro attends Author's Night 2017 to benefit the East Hampton Library on Aug. 12, 2017 in East Hampton, New York.
Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images Conan O'Brien once memorably described Robert Caro's sweeping series of biographies about Lyndon Baines Johnson as Harry Potter for adults. But perhaps the better comparison is the nonfiction version of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice And Fire .
Both series are epic narratives that tell the tale of political power grabs, court intrigue, and the surprising ways that petty jealousies and other personal feelings can influence the course of nations. Anyone who read about King Joffrey's reign in Martin's novels would nod appreciatively at Caro's often-repeated maxim that power doesn't necessarily corrupt, but that ""power always reveals.""
But let's not mince words. The main parallel between The Years of Lyndon Johnson and A Song of Ice And Fire is this: Fans get sucked into the story and then wait impatiently for years — decades! — for the next installment of the series to be written and published. Martin has repeatedly enraged his fans by writing sidebar projects instead of the long-awaited next novel. At first glance, Caro's new book, Working, could open him up to the same type of barrages that Martin has regularly invited. It is, after all, not the final installment covering the bulk of LBJ's White House years.

Amazon Independent Booksellers But that would be the wrong response. Working is an inspiring — and reading it as a journalist, honestly sometimes shame-inducing — window into the seemingly superhuman reporting, researching, writing, patience, and above all, will-power that have powered his reinvention of the political biography and history genre. First in The Power Broker — his biography of New York's Robert Moses — and then in his four LBJ books, Caro has explained, in painstaking and memorable detail, exactly how two men have gone about accumulating political power, and then used that power to reshape both New York and the entire country for generations to come. Even if he or she isn't planning on spending decades turning over every single detail of a subject's life, a reporter, author, or researcher will come away from this book armed with several new approaches to fact-finding and writing.
There's a lot in here, even though the book clocks in at a very unCaro-like 207 pages. The most surprising revelation: Caro, who has averaged about a decade between the publication of each volume of his LBJ series, is actually a pretty fast writer. A college professor once chided him for ""thinking with your fingers"" — in other words, dashing off articles and papers at the very last minute, without any time for revisions or re-writes. (It's a process us radio reporters are pretty familiar with.)
Determined to write in a more thoughtful way when he began working on books, Caro came up with a scheme to slow himself down: ""I resolved to write my first drafts in longhand, slowest of the various means of committing thoughts to paper, before I started doing later drafts on the typewriter."" As most other writers have shifted from PCs to laptops to tablets and smartphones, Caro has stuck with his Smith-Corona Electra 210.
The least-surprising revelation: Robert Caro is compulsive, obsessive — maybe even manic — about tracking down every last fact and every last interview. ""When you need to get information from somebody, you have to find some way to get it, "" he writes. You get that information, even if doing-so means uprooting your life and moving to rural Texas for three years in order to build trust with the people who lived in and around Johnson City, Texas, where LBJ grew up. Or staring down the 45-million pages of documents at the Johnson Presidential Library. Or, working off the incredibly vague tip that a key college classmate of LBJ's had moved somewhere in Florida ""north of Miami, and had 'Beach' in its name,"" managing to track him down and interview him. Caro writes:
""Ina [Caro's wife and research collaborator] and I got a map of Florida, and for each city or town north of Miami that had 'Beach' in its name, we got the names of all its mobile home courts. We divided up the names and started calling each court to see if a Whiteside was staying there. It was a court in Highland Beach, Florida, that said, yes there was.""
He, of course, got on the next flight to Florida, drove to Highland Beach, and knocked on Vernon Whiteside's door. ""While I am aware that there is no Truth,"" Caro writes, ""there are Facts, objective facts. Discernible and verifiable. And the more facts you accumulate, the closer you come to whatever truth there is. And finding facts — through reading documents or through interviewing and re-interviewing — can't be rushed; it takes time.""
Do you see what I mean about how this book both inspires and shames reporters and writers?
Robert Caro's chapters are unique. Often appearing to veer wildly off the course of his books' primary topics, they function as mini-biographies of well-known political figures like New York Governor Al Smith or House Speaker Sam Rayburn; or, just as often, primers on characters lost to history like longtime Johnson Senate aide Bobby Baker. After spending several hundred pages with them, the reader comes to know and love or loathe them, appreciate their place in history, and understand why the story about Robert Moses or Lyndon Johnson wouldn't be complete without these details about the main subjects' peers and rivals. Every Caro superfan has his or her favorites.
Working weaves through Caro's career and provides the backstory of some of his best chapters. He writes about going door to door in a Bronx neighborhood devastated by one of Robert Moses' highways. After moving to Texas, he learned how women in the Hill Country struggled to pump water, do laundry, cook, and take care of every other basic household task in the years before a young Johnson convinced the federal government to electrify his rural district.
But reading all this left me worried about the fate of that final book dealing with most of Johnson's presidency. Not because Caro is 83 — ""I can do that math"" he defensively writes at one point in Working — but because of his admitted need to track down every single fact, and answer every single question before he finishes a book. It's that ""something in my nature,"" he writes: ""After I had gotten every question answered, to suddenly think, despite myself, of new questions that, in the instant of thinking of them, I felt must be answered for my book to complete."" Over and over again, he recounts how finding that one last person, unearthing that one last document, would shed some light on the path of a highway, or something about Johnson's college years.
How does that compulsion affect the research and writing of a book that will deal with not only the bulk of one of the most consequential presidencies in American history, but also one of the country's most transformative decades? ""A lot happened during the 1960s to give hope, a lot happened during the 1960s to give despair. They were the years that changed America,"" Caro notes. And Lyndon Johnson was right in the center of it, using the political power that Caro has spent his adult life studying to both its most awe-inspiring and most terrible potential. As Caro writes:
""Every time an elderly man or woman, or an impoverished man or woman of any age, gets a doctor's bill or a hospital bill and sees that it's been paid by Medicare of Medicaid, that's political power. Every time a black man or woman is able to walk into a voting booth in the South because of Lyndon Johnson's Voting Rights Act, that's political power. And so, unfortunately, is a young man — 58,000 young American men — dying a needless death in Vietnam. That's political power.""
I assume, decades into his dealings with Johnson, that Caro has solved the riddle of where to start. But based on everything he writes in Working, the more important question is where to finish. ""I have to accept the fact that in deciding to research and write that chapter,"" Caro notes, looking back on the iconic Power Broker chapter about how one mile of the Cross-Bronx Expressway ruined a neighborhood and so many lives, ""there was really no choice involved; that I really didn't have one.""
If Caro had to go back — and back and back and back — to answer every question in his mind about one mile of roadway, how will he ever be satisfied enough to step away from the legal pad and the typewriter on a book about Civil Rights and the Great Society and Vietnam and Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy and everything else?
After all, as Caro concedes in this memoir, ""of course there was more. If you ask the right questions, there always is. That's the problem."""

14-Year Oil Spill In The Gulf Of Mexico Could Go On For Decades,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/710974094/14-year-oil-spill-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-could-go-on-for-decades,"The U.S. Coast Guard is trying to clean up an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that's been going on since 2004 when a hurricane toppled a rig owned by Taylor Energy, a New Orleans-based firm.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
How long does it take to stop an oil spill? In the Gulf of Mexico, the nation's longest offshore oil spill has been leaking for more than 14 years. There is still no solution in sight. Now the Coast Guard is stepping in to try to clean it up. Tegan Wendland of member station WWNO and NPR's Energy and Environment team, reports.
TEGAN WENDLAND, BYLINE: On a windy spring day, I set out on a tiny fishing boat with the captain and a scientist. Giant waves toss us around.
IAN MACDONALD: We're about 10 miles off the South Pass of the Mississippi River Delta. And the crew is standing up well, I think...
WENDLAND: (Laughter).
MACDONALD: ...To the challenging ocean conditions.
WENDLAND: I'm trying not to throw up, but Ian MacDonald is unfazed by the 6-foot waves. He's a scientist at Florida State University, where he studies oil spills.
The fumes hit us first. The smell is overwhelming. And then we see it. It's not a black, sticky slick but a glossy layer that stretches for miles.
MACDONALD: Here is some coming up. See how it's all rainbow sheen there? So that's oil.
WENDLAND: Way back in 2004, powerful Hurricane Ivan toppled an oil rig into the Gulf. It was owned by Taylor Energy, a New Orleans-based company, which managed to plug some of the 25 broken pipes. But the leak didn't stop.
Jonathan Henderson runs an environmental nonprofit called Vanishing Earth and worries about the impact on marine life.
JONATHAN HENDERSON: Everything that lives and breathes in the Gulf of Mexico travels back and forth through that zone - fish and the sea birds and the sea turtles and the dolphins.
WENDLAND: The government is studying this, but it's hard. They can't even figure out exactly how much is leaking. Neither can the company. Henderson's been trying to monitor it himself, doing regular flyovers and reporting what he sees.
HENDERSON: I don't see why, if it's going to continue to leak, that they can't recover some of this oil. I mean, if we can put a man on the moon, we can figure out how to, like, grab oil that's coming up from the seafloor and 400 feet of water.
WENDLAND: The Department of the Interior and the Coast Guard have been working with the company to try to stop the leak for years, but it's a major engineering challenge. The wells were buried under hundreds of feet of mud in an underwater mudslide, which are common in this area where the murky Mississippi dumps into the Gulf. Ed Richards is a law professor at Louisiana State University.
ED RICHARDS: This is a well-known high-risk area. You have a whole huge amount of unconsolidated sediment coming out of the river basically piling up.
WENDLAND: He says the situation raises questions.
RICHARDS: Should they have been there? Should they have built the rig the way they built it? Should it have been permitted that way?
WENDLAND: And Taylor Energy's not the only company that built there. There are many rigs in the area. The company has spent about $500 million to try and stop the spill, and it's paying for pilots to fly over and monitor it. The companies reported less than a barrel of oil a day on the surface. But scientist MacDonald calculates that more than a hundred barrels a day are spilling into the Gulf. He says the whole situation should serve as a warning to regulators as they attempt to expand oil and gas drilling in the Atlantic, where underwater canyons pose a threat.
MACDONALD: So the idea that we would be building in deep water and making pipelines going back to land in an area that's susceptible to those kinds of accidents is something that we should take into account as we do our planning.
WENDLAND: And do you think we are?
MACDONALD: No.
WENDLAND: The Trump administration has rolled back offshore safety rules even as it works to open up more areas to drilling.
Back out in the Gulf, a giant ship looms in the distance - contractors hired by the Coast Guard to drop a giant metal dome over the wells and collect the oil. Taylor Energy says this could just make it worse, so it's suing the Coast Guard. Neither the government nor the company agreed to go on record, saying litigation is ongoing. MacDonald remains hopeful.
MACDONALD: I'm really glad to be out here and being able to see this operation because it's been a long time coming, and there's a lot riding on it.
WENDLAND: But in the end, he says, it might be that no one is able to stop the oil from bubbling up into the Gulf. If that's the case, according to government estimates, the leak could go on for a hundred more years.

Housing activists demonstrate against rent increases in Berlin,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/710956523/berliners-demonstrate-against-rent-sharks-in-fight-over-rising-rents,"Enlarge this image Protesters in Berlin carry a giant ""rent shark"" at a march against rent increases on Saturday. Michael Sohn/AP Michael Sohn/AP Protesters in Berlin carry a giant ""rent shark"" at a march against rent increases on Saturday.
Michael Sohn/AP A skeletal shark wound its way through the streets of Berlin, pursuing unlikely prey – the city's renters.
The makeshift ""rent shark"" was held aloft by participants in a demonstration against rent increases in Germany's capital city, Berlin, over the weekend.
Thousands attended the march, which was organized by an affordable housing advocacy group in an effort to collect signatures for a proposal that would transfer some of the city's increasingly expensive residential rental properties to public ownership.
If the group gathers enough signatures — about 20,000 — the city's government will have to consider a plan to seize more than 250,000 apartments from their corporate owners, The Associated Press reported .
The proposal would target for-profit companies that own more than 3,000 apartments in Berlin.
""These are companies that are coming in and seeing a really profitable market,"" Thomas McGath, a spokesperson for the group that organized the campaign, told NPR. ""It's not your normal mom and pop landlord.""
Under German law, the plan technically could happen. Article 15 of the German Constitution states that ""land, natural resources and means of production may, for the purpose of nationalisation, be transferred to public ownership.""
""At the beginning, some of the fathers of the constitution thought, 'Well, there could be a situation where the market ... gets out of control and then it could be important to get this regulation,"" Ralf Schoenball, a reporter for the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel , told KCRW Berlin . But Schoenball said the article has never been used before.
Berlin's property market isn't the priciest in Europe — or even in Germany — but it has grown rapidly in recent years. According to a report by Deutsche Bank Research , house and apartment prices in Berlin were up about 10 percent year over year in 2017.
The advocacy group has named its campaign ""Expropriate Deutsche Wohnen & Co,"" which translates as take possession of the real estate company Deutsche Wohnen, which owns about 160,000 residential and commercial units.
""There are a lot of stories about the Deutsche Wohnen ... that they raise rental fees, that they try to get rid of tenants with old contracts with low rental fees,"" Schoenball told KCRW Berlin. ""A lot of tenants are afraid that they could be put out of their apartment.""
The company's CEO, Michael Zahn, told AP the advocacy group's efforts wouldn't do anything to alleviate the city's housing crisis.
""Expropriation is creating a lot of emotions right now,"" Zahn told AP in an email. ""But it won't create a single apartment."" AP also reported that the company said, on average, its apartments are about 645 square feet and cost about the equivalent of $650 to rent, and that the company follows government rules for calculating permissible rent increases based on neighborhood averages.
If the campaign can pass its first hurdle and collect 20,000 signatures, the city's government will be tasked with drafting a counterproposal that satisfies the grassroots group. If the government fails, the group will need to rally another 170,000 signers to move the proposal to a referendum and then to a ballot, where a majority will be required to pass it."
"Nielsen's Tenure At DHS Was A Disaster, Rep. Thompson Says",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/710973482/nielsens-tenure-at-dhs-was-a-disaster-rep-thompson-says,"David Greene talks to Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi about Kirstjen Nielsen resigning as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. NPR's Domenico Montanaro weighs in.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
As Homeland Security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen has defended some of the Trump administration's most controversial positions. And now she is out of a job. She is going to be stepping down on Wednesday. President Trump says he has accepted her resignation. Among other things, Secretary Nielsen forcefully defended the policy of separating families at the southern border after they crossed into the U.S. illegally. Our colleague, John Burnett, asked her about that policy last May.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Separating families is an - it's an extreme measure.
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN: Well, it's not. Again, we do it every day in every part of the country. If you have a family, and you commit a crime, the police do not not put you in jail because you have a family. They prosecute you, and they incarcerate you. Illegal aliens should not get just different rights because they happen to be illegal aliens.
GREENE: We're joined this morning by the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. It's Democratic Congressman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. Congressman, thanks for taking the time.
BENNIE THOMPSON: Yeah, thank you for having me.
GREENE: So I know your committee. And you follow what happens in this department very closely. We have a change at the top now. You called Secretary Nielsen's tenure a disaster. President Trump has tapped, as her successor, at least in the acting role, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan. What do you think of him?
THOMPSON: Well, we've had several meetings with him. He tends to be, as you know, a senior person in the department. He's been there a long time. And - but again, I don't think Superman could work for President Trump and get along with him because his policies on immigration are so extreme that a person can do their job in the eyes of the law and still fail in the eyes of President Trump.
GREENE: Well, can I just ask you, Congressman, I - if we could zero in on exactly what's happening at the border right now. I mean, I was down there with a reporting team last week in El Paso. And we saw so many families coming across the border, many of them trying to claim asylum. And the mayor of El Paso, Dee Margo, described the responsibility for this moment this way.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
DEE MARGO: Well, they've got to revamp this law and the whole immigration process. They've not done anything for 30 years. There's been no intestinal fortitude exhibited on either side of the aisle. And our president needs to take the lead there. That's the humanitarian crisis, is changing the law. That's the problem.
GREENE: I mean, it appears that current law allows this to be happening in these numbers. Is that fair, and isn't that something that Congress needs to do if this next secretary's going to be able to deal with this crisis?
THOMPSON: Well, I think that we have to do what the law requires right now on the way toward comprehensive immigration reform. We can't stop foreign aid to the Northern Triangle countries. We can't institute policies inconsistent with the law as it is now. Zero-tolerance policy is a bad policy. It's led to a lot of what we are dealing with now. The return-to-Mexico policy, the notion of metering, all those things, David, compound the situation.
But if the president is supposed to be disappointed in what's going on, I encourage him to sit down and talk responsively to those policy heads (inaudible). I've chaired the committee since January. I've not had any engagement from the White House on this immigration topic. I'm absolutely open. But, you know, we have to do more than tweet. If there are some things that we need to work on, we are prepared as Democrats, and I'm prepared as chair of the committee, to sit down and talk through it. But it has to be a civil conversation. It has to be a conversation based on the facts.
GREENE: But with respect, Congressman, I mean, Democrats have already taken votes on things like the war in Yemen, on climate change - I mean, you're in leadership now. What specific idea do you have? If this situation at the border dates back, it seems, to a law that's, like, a decade old that allows people to bring kids across and come into the country, what specific idea are you offering the incoming secretary to deal with these numbers crossing the border right now?
THOMPSON: Well, the best thing I can offer, at this point, is to say, why do we separate children when they come at the border? Children need to be with parents if at all possible. We...
GREENE: But the Trump administration ended that policy. I mean, they're allowed to remain with their parents now when they cross. Isn't that right?
THOMPSON: Well, that's not true. They're still separating families as we speak. So what they say to you but what in - is reality is absolutely not true. So we're continuing to try to work on this issue. But all our departments that are charged with this responsibility have to work together. DHS through CDC has to talk to ICE, has to talk to HHS. So the seamless operation is still very challenging. And I, again, say to the Trump administration, let's sit down and talk and work through these issues.
GREENE: Congressman Bennie Thompson is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. Congressman, thanks very much.
THOMPSON: Thank you.
GREENE: And NPR's lead political editor, Domenico Montanaro, is on the line with us. Hi, Domenico.
DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hi, David.
GREENE: Interesting there. I mean, when we had our team in El Paso last week, it appeared that if you were a parent of a child, you were not being separated from your child. It sounds like Democrats are very determined to say that that is not always the case and say that the Trump administration is still separating families. What's going on here?
MONTANARO: Well, the fact of the matter is there hasn't been a comprehensive immigration bill that's passed since 2013. And that passed with 68 votes in the Senate but was never brought up for a vote in the House. And beyond that, there hasn't been a lot of work to be done to try to get a real, you know, piece of legislation that goes forward that hasn't been so overly politicized to a point where - you know, that people can't come to the table.
The Trump administration has gone the complete opposite direction of where Republicans had been in the past, very recently, looking to want to do something to try to, you know, not just work with - you know, not shutting down the border, but getting people who are in this country to have either a path to legalization or citizenship. And it has gone the complete opposite way. And that's where this Trump administration is at this point.
GREENE: So there does not seem to be any effort at bipartisanship to solve this crisis at the border right now, at a time when people like the mayor of El Paso are begging Congress and the president to do something together.
MONTANARO: None, because it has become so polarized.
GREENE: NPR lead political editor, Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, thanks.
MONTANARO: You're welcome.

"17-Foot Python In Florida Breaks Record, Park Officials Say",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/710972766/17-foot-python-in-florida-breaks-record-park-officials-say,"Updated at 1 p.m. ET
In the Florida Everglades, a team of invasive species researchers got more than it bargained for – a 17-foot-long python, plus 73 developing python eggs.
On Friday, Big Cypress National Preserve announced in a post to Facebook that its team of researchers had discovered the largest python ever to be removed from the swamp.
The pregnant female weighed 140 pounds, though presumably some of that was egg weight.
They found the record-breaking python using a new, and intuitive, tracking method — tagging male pythons and following them on their quest for female mates.
The python was captured and killed, according to The Washington Post . Preserve officials explained that they don't kill the pythons because they are snakes; they kill them because they are an invasive species.
""They are being humanely euthanized because they are having a huge, negative impact on native animals such as deer, wading birds, and even Florida panthers by taking away food from the endangered native Panther,"" preserve officials wrote . ""Rescues are already over-crowded with unwanted pet snakes. It is not fun in any way to euthanize these creatures, but it is done to protect the many native species that do live in Big Cypress National Preserve.""
Pythons are invasive to Big Cypress, so the preserve's resource management staff works with the U.S. Geological Survey to ""locate and remove"" breeding pythons from the area.
Thousands of Burmese pythons live in the wild all over South Florida, according to a National Park Service fact sheet . Pet owners either release them on purpose when they get too big, or by accident when hurricanes sweep through the state.
The invasive species is numerous and lethal. Pythons kill animals and birds by squeezing them until they pass out.
A 2011 study found that sightings of some of the python's favorite foods — rabbits, foxes, raccoons, white-tailed deer and opossums — have gone down by more than 90 percent in the Everglades, while python sightings have been on the rise.
Without any natural predators in North America, pythons rule the roost.
But the slippery serpents may have met their match in Big Cypress' research team. Between 2000 and 2009, more than 1,000 pythons were captured and removed from Everglades National Park.

toggle caption Zoran Orlic/Courtesy of the artist Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy is surprising fans with a new album this week. WARMER is due out April 13 and will initially be available on vinyl only as a Record Store Day exclusive limited to 5,000 copies. The album is a sequel to Tweedy's previous full-length, WARM , which came out less than five months ago.
While the full album will (for a while) only be available to hear if you own a record player, Tweedy is sharing one song from WARMER via YouTube now. The T-Rex-inspired track ""Family Ghost"" is a warped and woozy shuffle that finds Tweedy reflecting on a troubled past America can't seem to shake. ""Spray paint me gold / Pull my face up to the blinds,"" he sings. ""I'm a family ghost you'll never leave behind.""
YouTube The ten tracks on WARMER were recorded during the same sessions for WARM , at Wilco's Chicago studio, The Loft.
""At some point I separated the songs from the WARM/WARMER session into two records with individual character,"" Tweedy says in a press release announcing the album. ""But [I] still tried to keep the overall tone and texture of the combined session consistent. In a lot of ways these two records could have been released as a double LP. WARMER means as much to me as WARM and might just as easily have been released as the first record of the pair.""
A digital download and streaming version of WARMER will be available sometime later this year.

The Summit will feature on-stage interviews by podcast creator and host Guy Raz with founders of major U.S. companies, representing a wide range of industries including technology, consumer products, wellness and music. Confirmed speakers include the founders of Atom Factory , Away , Bliss , Edible Arrangements , Instagram , JetBlue , Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams , Slack, Stacy's Pita Chips and Urban One. Additional guests will be announced in the months leading up to the Summit.
This year's Summit has expanded to two days of programming, starting on the afternoon of Tuesday, October 22nd, followed by a full day on Wednesday, October 23rd . The Summit is a unique opportunity for current and aspiring entrepreneurs to build connections, exchange ideas and draw inspiration from a variety of powerful stories from leading business owners.
The Summit will bring some of the most popular guests from the How I Built This podcast to the main stage, where Guy Raz will further explore specific themes and ideas from their episodes. Programming will also include facilitated track sessions where attendees will examine topics related to business fundamentals, personal and organizational leadership and entrepreneurial innovation.
American Express, a multi-year sponsor of NPR and the How I Built This franchise, will continue its support as the Presenting Sponsor of the How I Built This Summit with Guy Raz.
""I have been to many conferences in my life. At last year's inaugural HIBT Summit, I was blown away at the energy, the generosity and incredible kindness I saw in the entrepreneurs and builders who attended,"" says podcast creator and host Guy Raz. ""I can't wait to spend two days with this remarkable community at this year's Summit. These aren't just entrepreneurs at different stages in the development of their businesses, but also idealists who are coming with new ways to innovate, problem-solve and create. And this year's Summit will provide even more opportunities for those gathered to forge lasting connections and friendships and to build real-world skills that will help in the development of their personal and professional growth.""
The Summit's track sessions are intended to foster learning and the exchange of entrepreneurial ideas. The Fundamentals track will deepen participants' understanding of key business topics, and will include a facilitated 'Pitch to your Peers' activity to encourage networking and help participants practice getting the word out about their business ideas. The Leadership Track will focus on the development and refinement of personal and organizational leadership skills, challenging participants to reflect on and share their own paths to leadership. The Innovation Track will explore today's technological and business trends with industry experts and provide participants with concrete strategies and tactics to employ in their own business planning.
""We want to continue to foster and grow the community of entrepreneurs that were drawn to the first How I Built This Summit,"" adds Jessica Goldstein, NPR Senior Director of Events and Strategic Initiatives.

Morteza Nikoubazl/Reuters Updated at 12:55 p.m. ET
The Trump administration is designating Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization, taking an unprecedented step as it seems to increase pressure on Iran's regime. The move seems certain to bring a new level of tension between the two countries, as Iran's leaders have said they will retaliate in kind.
Iranian lawmakers have prepared legislation that would label part of the U.S. military as a terrorist group, according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency.
President Trump announced the designation Monday morning, in a shift from the decades in which the U.S. has viewed Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism.
""This unprecedented step, led by the Department of State, recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft,"" Trump said in a White House statement. ""The IRGC is the Iranian government's primary means of directing and implementing its global terrorist campaign.""
In response, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif urged his government to add the Pentagon's U.S. Central Command to its own list of terrorist organizations, IRNA reports .
With the U.S. designation, anyone who deals with the Revolutionary Guard could run the risk of facing criminal charges, such as aiding or supporting a terrorist group.
""If you are doing business with the IRGC, you will be bankrolling terrorism,"" Trump said.
It's the first time the U.S. has declared an element of a foreign government to be a terrorist organization, the Trump administration says. The Revolutionary Guard now joins ISIS, Boko Haram and other groups on the U.S. list of terrorist groups .
Laying out the administration's reasoning for the designation, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo listed a string of attacks and violent plots, which he said gave ""ample justification for today's decision.""
Among the cases cited by Pompeo were two that directly involved the U.S.: the 1996 Khobar Towers apartment complex bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 American service members and wounded dozens more; and a 2011 case in which the Obama administration said it had foiled a Quds Force plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. in a bombing in Washington, D.C.
Today, the White House sees the IRGC as an ""active and enthusiastic participant in acts of terror,"" a senior administration official said in a background briefing held shortly before Pompeo discussed the announcement Monday morning.
Accusing Iran of using the Revolutionary Guard to try to reshape the Middle East in its favor, another official said the group has amassed too much power and money, which he said it then uses to support attacks on Americans and U.S. assets.
""The Middle East cannot be more stable and peaceful without a weakened IRGC,"" the official said.
In recent months, the Trump administration has sought to impose ""maximum pressure"" on Iran's regime, after abandoning the nuclear deal brokered during the Obama administration. Even before news emerged of a possible terrorism designation for the Revolutionary Guard, more than 970 Iranian entities and individuals were already under U.S. sanctions.
But the administration is now taking the rare step of designating another country's military force as a terrorist group.
""In the past, part of the Guard Corps, known as the Quds Force, has been targeted by Washington,"" NPR's Peter Kenyon reports. ""Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted that President Trump 'should know better than to be conned into another U.S. disaster.' ""
Zarif and other Iranian officials sharply criticized the U.S. plan over the weekend, after news emerged that an official U.S. announcement against the Revolutionary Guard was imminent.
Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, warned that if the U.S. labels his force as a terrorist group, the result would mean the Revolutionary Guard could target the U.S. military the same way it currently targets ISIS.
""If (the Americans) make such a stupid move, the U.S. Army and American security forces stationed in West Asia [Middle East] will lose their current status of ease and serenity,"" Jafari said, according to the semi-official FARS News Agency.
""I do not think that the Americans will be that much out of their mind to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization,"" Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani said, according to FARS.
The U.S. designation of the Revolutionary Guard comes one day before Israel holds a national vote on the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Responding to news of the pending announcement, Zarif said Trump is granting a long-held request from Netanyahu.
Netanyahu welcomed the move once it became official Monday, calling Trump a ""dear friend"" and thanking the president for his decision.
""Once again you are keeping the world safe from Iran aggression and terrorism,"" Netanyahu said via Twitter .
When asked about the timing of the designation on Monday, senior Trump administration officials said it had been in the works for months. They also said that in the past, there has been bipartisan U.S. support for declaring the Revolutionary Guard a terrorist group.
As Pompeo described the Trump administration's rationale for making the terrorist designation, he said the Revolutionary Guard now plays a large role in Iran's economy, ""through pure kleptocracy.""
The U.S. has previously targeted the Revolutionary Guard's investment arm — the IRGC Cooperative Foundation, or Bonyad Taavon Sepah — with the Treasury Department saying in 2010 that military leaders were using the organization to exert control over Iran's defense production, construction, and oil and gas sectors.
On Monday, Pompeo noted that last July, officials in Tehran said the Revolutionary Guard's foundation had ""embezzled more than $1 billion from the city"" and that Tehran's mayor, a former guard commander, has been accused of ""steering contracts to the IRGC.""
""The leaders of Iran are racketeers, not revolutionaries,"" Pompeo said.
Administration officials also reiterated allegations against Iran that were made last week, when the State Department's Brian Hook, U.S. special representative for Iran, blamed Iran for the deaths of hundreds of American service personnel in Iraq.
""Iran is responsible for the deaths of at least 608 American service members"" in Iraq, Hook said , citing U.S. military reports.
When he announced that figure, Hook did not give many details about those deaths; on Monday, he said the U.S. personnel had been killed by improvised explosive devices that Iran supplied to militias in Iraq.
""This accounts for 17 percent of all deaths of U.S. personnel in Iraq from 2003 to 2011,"" Hook said last week. ""This death toll is in addition to the many thousands of Iraqis killed by the IRGC's proxies.""
Hook also accused Iran of causing widespread problems, saying it supports the Hezbollah in Lebanon and Palestinian groups such as Hamas, and backs the Houthi military insurgency in Yemen, where Iran has been engaged in a proxy war with Saudi Arabia.

Scientists Test Whether Brain Stimulation Could Help Sharpen Aging Memory,www.npr.org,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/08/711010354/scientists-test-whether-brain-stimulation-could-help-sharpen-aging-memory,"Are We Ready For An Implant That Can Change Our Moods?
Applying weak electrical current to the scalp is not a new concept. It goes back as far as ancient Rome, where Scribonius Largus, physician to Emperor Claudius, laid live electric torpedo fish across the heads of headache patients.
Transcranial electric stimulation is the modern version of electric fish , and it generated renewed interest in the early 2000s, with papers demonstrating how one form of the treatment, applying a weak, one-way current, could excite or calm large swaths of neurons. Other work suggested that it could improve motor learning . Later research found that weak electric current could synchronize the activity of populations of neurons, making them fire together. Many in the field began exploring how tweaking this synchronized activity might induce behavioral changes, like boosting memory.
The research also spawned an active, and potentially ill-advised, DIY community of brain stimulation enthusiasts who swap protocols on Reddit forums for improving learning or relieving depression. Many experts advise against this , claiming we still have much to learn about what noninvasive brain stimulation actually does to the brain, and that improper use could be dangerous.
That's why studies like this one are so important, says Marom Bikson , a biomedical engineer at the City College of New York. Bikson was not involved in this study, but developed the brain stimulation technique used by the authors, a more targeted form of brain stimulation known as HD transcranial alternating-current stimulation or HD-tACS. These authors set out to rigorously test the underlying biological mechanism driving poor memory — mismatched brain rhythms in the temporal and prefrontal cortex — and observe how stimulation can affect them.
To do this, the researchers gave a group of younger adults and older adults a working memory task while hooked up to an EEG, which can measure brainwave activity in both regions. An image flashed on a screen, say a fire hydrant, then the subject would see a series of other images, and would have to distinguish images they'd seen previously from new ones.
As expected, older adults were significantly slower and less accurate than younger adults on the test, and this poorer performance was associated with uncoupledbrain rhythms.
But to show that these out-of-sync circuits are actually causing working memory deficits, the researchers needed to go a step further. They needed to show that putting these areas back in sync boosted working memory performance.
The researchers did just that, using HD-tACS to tap into existing oscillations of precise brain areas and nudge them back into rhythm. Scientists Improve Mood By Stimulating A Brain Area Above The Eyes
Further, the researchers could tailor the frequency to each individual based on the EEG data they collected. Using a double-blind setup, where no one involved knew who was getting stimulated, the researchers placed a special cap on all participants as they did the memory exercise.
Older adults who received the brain stimulation were just as accurate as younger adults during the 25-minute stimulation period and continued to show improved performance for 50 minutes after the stimulation ended.
When Reinhart looked at the EEGs from the older adults who were getting the treatment, he found that their temporal and prefrontal cortex were in sync, just like a younger brain.
""Not only did we find that a decline in working memory is due to specific brain circuits becoming disconnected, but we also were able to noninvasively stimulate these faulty brain circuits in the elderly to rapidly boost their brain and memory function,"" says Reinhart.
The researchers also reversed the stimulation delivered to younger adults, temporarily desynchronizing their rhythms, and found their working memory declined, further demonstrating that synchronization between these brain areas is critical for working memory.
Finally, Reinhart took the poorest performing young adults from the first experiment, and stimulated their brains to synchronize these brain areas. The result? A boost in performance.
""I'm really excited by this paper,"" says Bikson. ""It advances the needle towards establishing a rigorous scientific base for this kind of brain stimulation technique.""
Horvath and Reinhart both caution that much more work remains before you can strap electrodes to your head and expect a cognitive boost. ""While these results are compelling, this is just one study from one group,"" says Horvath. ""I'd like to see this replicated by other labs, and extended to test other aspects of working memory.""
Horvath says this kind of boost in performance, while statistically significant, may not be clinically significant. ""Within each trial young adults got about 24 of 26 images correct, while older adults got about 22, and were boosted to about 24 with stimulation,"" he says. ""I'd question if this bump has any real-world or clinical value.""
Further, more research will need to be done to investigate whether these boosts last long after stimulation. ""At some point, you want to have these benefits without wearing an electrode cap,"" says Bikson.
This study didn't test the participants again after 50 minutes post-stimulation, so it's possible they had a boost that lasted longer, according to Reinhart. He says other brain stimulation studies have found changes in cognition that last for days, or even weeks. But is this stimulation just providing a temporary crutch? Or is it inducing lasting changes in the brain?
""A lot more research needs to be done to answer that question,"" says Reinhart. ""Still, it's pretty exciting to think that we might be able to just apply this stimulation and sync up your brain rhythms in a way that could sustain themselves on their own, providing a lasting boost in cognition.""

Tendai Marima for NPR Cyclone Idai was a major disaster. When it struck southeastern Africa on March 14, the storm destroyed more than 18,000 homes. The U.N. estimates that over 130,000 people are still in temporary shelters. The death toll is now 598 and expected to rise as officials reach remote areas to assess the damage. And in the wake of the storm, over 2,000 cases of cholera have been reported so far.
Behind those large numbers are many stories that bring the tragedy to a human level.
Some 148 people live on Rathmore Estate, a vast plantation in Zimbabwe that produces, timber and macadamia nuts for export. Only in the past week have medical charities and community village health workers begun to provide care for the farmworkers and their family members.
Matthew Chidambazina, 42, who lives on the estate, suffered severe arm and leg injuries after the roof of his home collapsed. It took seven days for medics to reach him.
""I had deep cuts that went right to the bone and I needed stitches, but I couldn't get to the hospital on time,"" he says. ""By the time the doctors came to the farm, they said it was too late [for stitches] so I've just been put on painkillers and antibiotics to reduce infection from the pus in the wounds.""
His co-worker, Tichanai Mutungwe, 38, bears both physical and emotional pain. He badly injured his arm while trying to save his 16-month-old child from being taken by the flood waters. The current was so strong that he couldn't hold onto her. Days later, Mutungwe found his daughter's body at the bottom of the slope from the farmworkers' houses. She was buried along with 10 others who died on the farming estate. Thirteen other residents are still missing.
Mutungwe's right hand has deep lacerations and his chest hurts from being dragged by the muddy waters. He's been improvising to treat his injuries. ""I use betadine to clean my wounds, but we don't have enough bandages or painkillers for my hand."" And he feels he must recover quickly: ""I've lost so much, but as a man I have to get back to work as soon as I can to feed my family. They need me to provide,"" he told NPR.
Maidei Masawi, the village health worker for the Rathmore area, told NPR that despite ordering basic supplies from the Chimanimani Rural District Hospital for its outreach workers, only limited amounts of drugs and health-care equipment like gloves have arrived because supplies are limited.

Tendai Marima for NPR ""I've been asking for simple things like painkillers, but we can't get them,"" says Masawi. ""There are small babies who are coughing and have this flu that won't go away, but there's nothing I can do for them. I can only wait to see what we can get from the outside aid.""
Health providers are struggling to reach people in remote areas.
""We are making efforts to get to the patients in the field and we try to give them what they need, but the major challenge is accessibility,"" says Farai Marume, the emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders (Medicines Sans Frontieres). ""We've tried to send some medications and team to assist at Chimanimani Rural Hospital, we have a list of the gaps and we're still trying to meet those gaps with our other [NGO and government] partners,"" he said.
The bicycle that health worker Ndakaziya Maputuri typically uses to get to patients in the five villages she covers was of no use on roads covered with rocky debris. She's based in Charter district, a vast timber plantation district east of Chimanimani, which until last week been cut off access by roads.
""There is nowhere you can reach with a car here, even with the bicycle I have,"" she says. ""I'm trapped by the stones in the road. Even if I walk to visit people, I can't find them."" That's because many people have left their homes and walked for several days to gather at distribution spots where aid is being delivered.
While UNICEF Zimbabwe acknowledges the dilemma people face with accessing aid and essential medicines, Denise Shepherd-Johnson, the chief communications officer, told NPR the organization was trying to direct disaster-relief funds to ensure that ample medical supplies could be made available.
""Essential medicines procured through UNICEF have been sent to affected areas. The challenge will be to mobilize resources estimated at $600,000 to replenish existing stocks of supplies being used in the response to the emergency,"" she wrote in an email.

Behind-the-scenes footage of Beyoncé and her assemble of performers in the weeks, days and moments leading up to Beychella — including a snippet of Blue Ivy mimicking her mother's choreography — is all set to audio of a Maya Angelou interview. Toward the end, an interviewer asks Angelou, ""What advice would you have to give to this generation?,"" to which Angelou responds, ""Tell the truth, to yourself first, and to the children.""
Beyoncé's show-stopping performance marks plenty of milestones for the superstar. The 2018 performance was the first time a black woman headlined Coachella in the festival's history. It also served as her victory lap for the superstar after the birth of her twins, Rumi and Sir, which prompted the performer to cancel her Coachella appearance in 2017. It's also the first time a Coachella performance has ever been broadcast outside of the official Coachella YouTube stream."
"After A Decade Of Netanyahu, Hopes Fade For A Palestinian State",www.npr.org,Daniel Estrin,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/709989737/after-a-decade-of-netanyahu-hopes-fade-for-a-palestinian-state,"Enlarge this image Israeli settlers celebrate the Jewish Purim holiday on al-Shuhada Street in the divided West Bank town of Hebron on March 21.

Hazem Bader/AFP/Getty Images When it came down to a final issue for Israeli voters to ponder before Tuesday's elections, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made an extraordinary campaign pledge: If re-elected, he said on Saturday, he would annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Such a move would represent a dramatic, far-right policy change for Israel, staking a permanent claim over lands Palestinians demand for their own state.
Even if it is an election tactic to energize his nationalist base, Netanyahu's annexation pledge is a fitting final chord to a decade of his administration, which began with a reluctant embrace of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and ended with the chances of such an outcome dwindling to a new low point.
Since Netanyahu returned to office in 2009, the Jewish settler movement has grown in size and influence. That evolution was apparent last month in the West Bank city of Hebron.
In one of the West Bank's tensest cities — where several hundred Israeli settlers live in guarded enclaves among some 200,000 Palestinians — Israelis dressed up in costume and paraded down the main street. It was the Jewish carnival holiday of Purim, but the settlers were celebrating more than just the religious festivities.
In January, they had successfully lobbied Netanyahu to expel an international observer group tasked with patrolling Hebron and making Palestinians in the city feel safe after an Israeli settler killed 29 Palestinian worshippers there on Purim in 1994.

Daniel Estrin/NPR ""We will not allow the continuation of an international force that acts against us,"" Netanyahu said in a statement about the Temporary International Presence in Hebron.
Settlers had accused the organization of causing friction and undermining Israeli rule in the city. But member countries of the group criticized the closure of the mission, saying the observers promoted ""conflict resolution between Israelis and Palestinians"" and helped prevent violence.

Vegan Protesters Block Downtown Melbourne In Coordinated Action Across Australia,www.npr.org,Laurel Wamsley,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711046738/vegan-protesters-block-downtown-melbourne-in-coordinated-action-across-australia,"Enlarge this image Animal rights protesters link arms to block an intersection in the central business district of Melbourne, Australia, on Monday. Ellen Smith/Reuters Ellen Smith/Reuters Animal rights protesters link arms to block an intersection in the central business district of Melbourne, Australia, on Monday.
Ellen Smith/Reuters Vegan protesters brought the central business district in Melbourne, Australia, to a halt for two and a half hours on Monday morning. In Queensland, activists broke into a slaughterhouse and negotiated the release of three sheep.
The protests were part of a coordinated action intended to promote veganism and bring attention to conditions at Australia's factory farms.
In Melbourne, ""activists chained themselves to three Thrifty rental vans in the middle of the intersection, causing traffic chaos and affecting 11 tram lines. It also forced ambulances to take different routes to five major hospitals,"" The Sydney Morning Herald reports . Protesters also linked arms before the city's Sea Life aquarium.
Protesters held signs that said ""You have been lied to,"" as well as the URL for the documentary Dominion , which aims to ""expose the dark underbelly"" of Australia's factory farms and slaughterhouses.

— Dominic Cansdale (@DominicCansdale) April 7, 2019 Police arrested 39 people in Melbourne, including a 15-year-old and two 17-year-olds. Police in the state of Victoria, where Melbourne is located, complained that protesters had not worked with police in advance and caused considerable disruption during rush hour.
""Police are able to facilitate planned protests when we are engaged with which doesn't put the community at risk,"" Victoria Police Superintendent David Clayton said in a statement. ""This lack of engagement puts the entire community at risk with road closures and delays to transport services. We respect the right for people to protest peacefully but we will not tolerate anti-social behaviour that disrupts the broader community.""
Slaughterhouses were the site of protests elsewhere in the country. Nine people were arrested for chaining themselves to machinery at an abattoir in New South Wales.
In Yangan, Queensland, protesters arranged a deal with the owners of a slaughterhouse: The activists would unchain themselves and leave if the owners would hand over three sheep (which will now live out their days on a farm), and agree not to file a complaint with police.
Australia is second only to the U.S. in the amount of meat consumed per capita .
Vegan Rising campaign director Kristin Leigh told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the Melbourne protest was one of nine that were planned across the country.
""We want people to go vegan, we want people to stop supporting animal abuse,"" Leigh told the broadcaster. ""I don't believe any good person supports what's happening in slaughterhouses and so-called farms today, these are places of exploitation of innocent vulnerable beings. Animals are suffering in ways that most of us could never imagine. It's not about bigger cages, it's about animal liberation.""
And now animal rights activists are at the Sea Life aquarium. Some are refusing to leave. Police on scene too. @abcmelbourne pic.twitter.com/eMt6j0hom9
— Dominic Cansdale (@DominicCansdale) April 8, 2019 Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison rebuked the protesters as ""shameful and un-Australian"" and asked for authorities to bring ""the full force of the law... against these green-collared criminals,"" the BBC reports .
The country's attorney general, Christian Porter, called for two investigations: one into the protests, and another into an organization called Aussie Farms, which has posted an online map of Australia's factory farms and slaughterhouses. Porter also urged jurisdictions to consider increasing penalties for criminal trespass.
""There are strong grounds to conclude that Aussie Farms Inc is engaging in a systematic effort in collecting, using and disclosing personal information to the detriment of farmers and agricultural producers,"" the attorney general said, according to the Morning Herald .
The newspaper reports that the government reclassified Aussie Farms last week to make it subject to Australia's Privacy Act, under which organizations and individuals can be fined significant sums if they use personal information unlawfully."

Secret Service Director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles is leaving his job, according to the White House.
In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Alles ""has done a great job at the agency"" and would be stepping down shortly to be replaced by James M. Murray, a career Secret Service member who will start in May.
Alles took over the post in April 2017 , coming over from Customs and Border Protection, another agency within DHS. He is a retired Marine Corps general.

A Chinese woman carrying a thumb drive infected with malware talked her way into the club while the president was nearby. She was stopped only after telling a reception desk attendant she was at the club to attend a nonexistent function.
After it happened, Trump defended the service's actions, saying: ""I could not be happier with Secret Service. Secret Service has done a fantastic job from Day 1. Very happy with them.""

The Secret Service is part of DHS and Alles' departure follows the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen , as well as Trump's decision to withdraw Ronald Vitiello, his nominee to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in favor of someone ""tougher.""

Her frame of reference is vast — ranging from glam rock to folk music.
TERRY GROSS, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. Billie Eilish is a 17-year-old singer-songwriter from California who's just released her debut album titled ""When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?"" She's already enormously popular on the strength of a series of singles she's released, most of them recorded at home with her brother as her producer. Rock critic Ken Tucker says no one else in current music sounds like Billie Eilish. Here's his review.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BAD GUY"")
BILLIE EILISH: (Vocalizing). (Singing) White shirt now red, my bloody nose - sleeping, you're on your tippy toes - creeping around like no one knows, think you're so criminal.
KEN TUCKER, BYLINE: Over a pulsing beat, the voice of Billie Eilish slides in. That voice is at once intimate, confiding and slurry. It's hard to catch the words, but you get the gist. She's taunting a guy for being a bad guy. But then, mid-verse, she changes course, suggesting that she's the bad guy - that far from being a victim, she's a perpetrator.
It's a clever, wily move. But then, so much of what this 17-year-old singer-songwriter does is wily and clever. And her debut album, called ""When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?"" is a frequently startling showcase for her sly smarts.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""WISH YOU WERE GAY"")
EILISH: (Singing) Baby, I don't feel so good - six words you never understood. I'll never let you go - five words you'll never say - aww. I laugh along four days has never felt so long. If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away.
(LAUGHTER)
EILISH: (Singing) I just want to make you feel OK. But all you do is look the other way. I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't want to stay. I just kind of wish you were gay.
TUCKER: Billie Eilish was raised in Los Angeles, home-schooled by parents who are actors. Over the past couple of years, young Billie has racked up over a billion streams for her songs of quiet angst and self-mocking humor - pretty good for a kid who's making most of her music at home in her bedroom with her brother. That brother is Finneas O'Connell, an actor and musician who writes some of her work and produces most of it.
The song I just played, ""Wish You Were Gay,"" is one of the singles that established her popularity. In it, she talks about a stalled romance. Rather than confronting the reasons he might not have liked her, she says she just wishes he were gay because, if so, the pressure would be off her. That is primo teenage thinking. And kudos to Eilish for being honest enough to set it to music. Another song, ""Xanny,"" may warm the hearts of parents with its anti-drug message.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""XANNY"")
EILISH: (Singing) What is it about them? I must be missing something. They just keep doing nothing, too intoxicated to be scared. Better off without them - they're nothing but unstable. Bring ashtrays to the table, and that's about the only thing they share. I'm in their secondhand smoke, still just drinking canned Coke. I don't need a Xanny to feel better. On designated drives home, only one who's not stoned. Don't give me a Xanny now or ever.
TUCKER: A song about being repulsed by her generation's rampant misuse of Xanax, ""Xanny"" tempts the listener to fixate on the lyrics. But the music should not be ignored. Eilish begins that song with a smoky sigh. It reminds me a little of Lana Del Rey and even more of the torch singer Julie London, to make a reference that might mean something to baby boomers but will seem hopelessly obscure to Eilish and her Generation Z core audience. There's a premature world-weariness about Eilish that she somehow makes enormously appealing. Her perennially poker-faced affect is a rebuke to any adult who might have the gall to tell her to lighten up. But her songs give her blank moodiness context, detail and weight.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BURY A FRIEND"")
EILISH: (Singing) What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me? What are you wondering? What do you know? Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me? When all fall asleep, where do we go?
CROOKS: Come here.
EILISH: (Singing) Say it. Spit it out. What is it exactly? You're paying? Is the amount cleaning you out? Am I satisfactory? Today I'm thinking about the things that are deadly. The way I'm drinking you down - like I want to drown, like I want to end me. Step on the glass.
TUCKER: That's ""Bury A Friend,"" whose screechy sound effects dramatize Eilish's lyric about a monster under the bed. She and her brother like to play around with her recorded voice, distorting it, making it blur into dance-pop whose beats owe something to hip-hop in their precise rhythms.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""MY STRANGE ADDICTION"")
EILISH: (Singing) Don't ask questions you don't want to know - learned my lesson way too long ago. To be talking to you, belladonna - should have taken a break, not an Oxford comma. Take what I want when I want to, and I want you. Bad, bad news...
TUCKER: Billy Eilish doesn't sound like anyone around right now, partly because her frame of reference seems so vast. In addition to hip-hop and electronic dance music, she seems to be on familiar terms with folk music, soul music, glam rock, heavy metal. It wouldn't have shocked me at all if this 17-year-old had concluded her album singing a duet with Willie Nelson. Instead, she wraps it up with three songs that are the most bleak and despairing ones on the album. I don't know where Eilish is heading, and I'll bet she finds my confusion just another measure of success.
GROSS: Ken Tucker reviewed Billie Eilish's new album, ""When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?"". Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, we'll talk about Congress in the Trump era. My guest will be Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer, who co-write Politico's newsletter Playbook and have written a new book called ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America."" I hope you'll join us.

toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Protesters gather outside the White House June 1, 2017, to protest President Trump's decision to withdraw the Unites States from the Paris climate change accord.
Susan Walsh/AP Climate change is often thought of as a partisan issue in the United States, but New York Times journalist Nathaniel Rich says that wasn't always the case.
Rich says that from 1979 until 1989, climate change was viewed as a bipartisan problem — then the the oil industry ""descended and bared its fangs"" and everything changed.
Goats and Soda It's 2050 And This Is How We Stopped Climate Change In his new book, Losing Earth , Rich writes that in the late 1980s, the American Petroleum Institute began paying scientists to write op-eds questioning climate science. He describes the effort as a campaign to ""sow propaganda [and] disinformation, to buy off politicians and scientists, and, ultimately, to convert an entire political party to denialism.""
Rich says the campaign paid off. No longer was climate science accepted as fact: ""All of a sudden,"" he says, ""you have a number of pieces that start to appear that say maybe there's not scientific consensus about this problem.""
World Photos: Youth Climate Change Demonstrations Across The World As a result, the Republican party began to shift its stance on climate change: ""It's become a starkly partisan issue,"" Rich says. ""And it seems like we are much further from a solution than we were 30 years ago.""
Interview highlights On oil industry research into climate science
The industry has been following this issue for a long time. There are studies from Exxon or even Humble Oil, the predecessor to Exxon, going back into the mid-1950s and even then, those studies were not about whether or not this was happening. The question was how much of the added CO2 in the atmosphere was because of Exxon — basically because of the fossil fuel industry. They continued to monitor this over the decades.
On how the American Petroleum Institute helped create a 'debate' around climate change
Book Reviews New Climate Books Stress We Are Already Far Down The Road To A Different Earth The head of the API program told me they gave $2,000 to a scientist whenever he wrote an op-ed for a national publication. That is almost an afterthought at the time. It's pretty low on the totem pole of what they're doing. They're also meeting with Congressmen and so on. But it pays enormous dividends, because all of a sudden national news publications start quoting these scientists — it's really a handful of people, four or five people — over and over again. And an issue that, at this point, has been a story about fear of what's going to happen, all of a sudden has two sides.
On climate change becoming a partisan issue
We've entered this weird funhouse realm where now if you jump ahead to the present day you have a political party ... that endorses a position that's essentially to the right even of what the industry now says in their public statements. Exxon publicly today doesn't deny climate change, but you have a party that does. I think it's something that future historians will spend a lot of time piecing out is: How this little lie grew into a big lie and overwhelmed our politics.

Amazon Independent Booksellers On a major turning point that occurred in 1989 when George H.W. Bush declined to sign a United Nations treaty addressing climate change
From '79 to '89 there are a series of escalating efforts to first bring the issue to the attention of the powers that be — people at the highest levels of the federal government — and then to bring it into the public to generate public concern. And finally, in the middle of the decade, a solution materializes which is a global treaty to reduce emissions that would be binding, and it's modeled after the ozone treaty, that's then in process.
By the end of the decade we've reached the point of high level diplomatic meetings to negotiate this binding global treaty. We get to the precipice of an agreement on the framework of this treaty, and at the very last second the U.S. pulls out. ... At least on paper that's the closest we've come.
I think you could have a reasonable debate about whether or not if the U.S. did sign the treaty we would've lived up to the terms of it, whether other countries would have lived up to the terms of it even if it was binding. And that's a more complicated conversation to have. I think at the very least we'd be a lot further ahead than we are now. That seems indisputable.
On what the Trump administration has done to undermine environmental protections
[Trump's] trying to roll back just about every policy that President Obama introduced, trying to roll back clean air standards, emissions from coal factories, mileage standards, CAFE standards they're called. You name it — an all-out assault, and not just on climate, but on any kind of environmental protection, I should say. I guess the only silver lining is that [with] something like the Paris Accord, he can he can withdraw, but the formal withdrawal doesn't happen for a couple of years, and even then the treaty is voluntary to begin with, so it's more of a political statement than anything else.
Rolling back emission standards is probably at the top of the list of the bad things that are going on. But I think more destructive is just this peddling of this fantasy, and it's connected to a lot of other stuff you see in the administration: a basic affront on objective reality. You see that extends beyond the climate conversation and into, the conversation we're having about news and reporting and historical fact and all the rest.
Climate change victimizes the victimized. It oppresses the oppressed. ... It cuts along class lines, racial lines, generational lines and socioeconomic lines. So the worse off you are, the more marginalized you are, the worse you're going to suffer from what's coming.
Nathaniel Rich
On what's new about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey's Green New Deal proposal
It's a statement of principles. Primarily it's not a law. It's not a bill. ... In some of the particulars, it's less ambitious than bills that were proposed and introduced into Congress at the end of the '80s by both Republicans and Democrats. I think what distinguishes it — and what makes it a truly transformational document — is that it identifies the climate crisis as connected to every form, essentially, of social injustice that we have. I think that's the only honest way of looking at it.
Climate change victimizes the victimized. It oppresses the oppressed. ... It cuts along class lines, racial lines, generational lines and socioeconomic lines. So the worse off you are, the more marginalized you are, the worse you're going to suffer from what's coming.
So [the Green New Deal is] extremely valuable in that it says that climate change is not just one item on this sort of menu of political items, but it's the one that encompasses them all. You can't have social justice if there's not climate justice. You can't have a civil society, a stable society, if you don't have a stable climate.
I think that's a profound argument and an honest one. It puts it into moral terms in a way that is new in Washington, and I think that is enormously valuable. You can get into the debate about how best to achieve certain goals — and those are important policy debates to have — but it's reframed the issue dramatically and I think critically.
On how to motivate Americans to care about climate change
This has been a big debate, particularly within the activist community, for a while now. It's essentially a marketing question: How do we get people to care about this problem and prioritize it? Is fear the best approach? Is hope? Inspiring people? I think that the trend has been towards the latter more.
Environment Concern About Global Warming Among Americans Spikes, Report Says ... We think of it almost in, like, Hollywood terms, like either we're going to win this thing, or we're going to suffer a crushing defeat. But, of course, there's a huge range of outcomes in between, and at this point where we're at — ranging from the not very good to the apocalyptic — but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to better our situation as much as possible.

Bring ashtrays to the table, and that's about the only thing they share. I'm in their secondhand smoke, still just drinking canned Coke. I don't need a Xanny to feel better. On designated drives home, only one who's not stoned. Don't give me a Xanny now or ever.
TUCKER: A song about being repulsed by her generation's rampant misuse of Xanax, ""Xanny"" tempts the listener to fixate on the lyrics. But the music should not be ignored. Eilish begins that song with a smoky sigh. It reminds me a little of Lana Del Rey and even more of the torch singer Julie London, to make a reference that might mean something to baby boomers but will seem hopelessly obscure to Eilish and her Generation Z core audience. There's a premature world-weariness about Eilish that she somehow makes enormously appealing. Her perennially poker-faced affect is a rebuke to any adult who might have the gall to tell her to lighten up. But her songs give her blank moodiness context, detail and weight.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BURY A FRIEND"")
EILISH: (Singing) What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me? What are you wondering? What do you know? Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me? When all fall asleep, where do we go?
CROOKS: Come here.
EILISH: (Singing) Say it. Spit it out. What is it exactly? You're paying? Is the amount cleaning you out? Am I satisfactory? Today I'm thinking about the things that are deadly. The way I'm drinking you down - like I want to drown, like I want to end me. Step on the glass.
TUCKER: That's ""Bury A Friend,"" whose screechy sound effects dramatize Eilish's lyric about a monster under the bed. She and her brother like to play around with her recorded voice, distorting it, making it blur into dance-pop whose beats owe something to hip-hop in their precise rhythms.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""MY STRANGE ADDICTION"")
EILISH: (Singing) Don't ask questions you don't want to know - learned my lesson way too long ago. To be talking to you, belladonna - should have taken a break, not an Oxford comma. Take what I want when I want to, and I want you. Bad, bad news...
TUCKER: Billy Eilish doesn't sound like anyone around right now, partly because her frame of reference seems so vast. In addition to hip-hop and electronic dance music, she seems to be on familiar terms with folk music, soul music, glam rock, heavy metal. It wouldn't have shocked me at all if this 17-year-old had concluded her album singing a duet with Willie Nelson. Instead, she wraps it up with three songs that are the most bleak and despairing ones on the album. I don't know where Eilish is heading, and I'll bet she finds my confusion just another measure of success.
GROSS: Ken Tucker reviewed Billie Eilish's new album, ""When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?"". Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, we'll talk about Congress in the Trump era. My guest will be Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer, who co-write Politico's newsletter Playbook and have written a new book called ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America.""

Jessica, the baby's aunt, called 911 when he was found limp. The operator failed to recognize that the baby was in cardiac arrest, meaning that his heart had stopped and he was not breathing, according to three emergency medical experts who reviewed a recording of the 911 call.
Kayana Szymczak for ProPublica This story is part of a collaboration between The Public's Radio and the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.
Conner had just gotten out of the shower and gone back downstairs to where his infant son was napping. Barbara heard Conner scream and ran up the stairs of her home in Warwick, R.I.
Conner handed her 6-month-old Alijah, who was limp.
Barbara tried to stay calm as she carried her grandson into the living room. She'd watched medical shows on TV where they did CPR on babies.
""He's turning purple!"" Barbara shouted as her daughter, Jessica, spoke to a 911 operator. (We're not using last names at the family's request to protect their privacy.)
""Do we give him mouth-to-mouth? What do we do?"" Jessica, the baby's aunt, asked the 911 operator at one point.
She never got a good answer.
The 911 operator — whom officials refused to identify — asked the same questions repeatedly, wasting crucial time. She gave incorrect information. And she failed to recognize that the baby was in cardiac arrest, meaning that his heart had stopped and he was not breathing, according to three emergency medical experts who reviewed a recording of the 911 call obtained by Barbara and provided to The Public's Radio.
The call on that Friday morning in February 2018 lasted nearly four minutes, at which point emergency medical services personnel arrived. During the call, the 911 operator never instructed the family in how to perform a basic, potentially lifesaving treatment: cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR.
By the time the baby arrived at the hospital, it was too late. Alijah was dead.
""I've listened to thousands of calls,"" said Dr. Jeff J. Clawson, medical director for the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch, a nonprofit in Salt Lake City. ""I would say that this particular call is in the top 15 worst calls I've ever heard in my life, maybe in the top 10.""
When it comes to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests such as this one, among the most serious calls the 911 emergency system handles, Rhode Island seems set up to fail, experts in emergency medical dispatch say.
The American Heart Association says that providing CPR instructions over the phone for emergency 911 calls involving cardiac arrest is the standard of care. Knowing how to perform CPR in person, experts say, is very different from instructing someone to do it by phone, akin to the difference between knowing how to tie your shoes and trying to explain it by phone to someone who has never done it before.
But there are no national training requirements for 911 call-takers. And the United States is a patchwork of different systems where performance varies widely.
On average, about one in 10 people in the U.S. who go into cardiac arrest outside of a hospital survives. But even in a small state like Rhode Island, experts say, the survival rate could double or triple — potentially saving hundreds of more lives a year — with earlier CPR.
The benefits are well documented. Seattle launched its program in the 1980s. ""They saw very quickly that they were literally snatching lives from the jaws of death among patients who had cardiac arrest in their homes and in the community,"" said Dr. Mickey Eisenberg, medical director of King County Emergency Medical Services.
At the urging of groups like the American Heart Association, Louisiana, Wisconsin and Kentucky passed laws last year requiring 911 call-takers and other emergency dispatchers to be trained in telephone CPR.
For the roughly half of Americans who don't know CPR, as well as others who are reluctant to perform it, the guidance they receive from a 911 operator can be crucial.
""I continue to see cases where I think that we could have saved people, and that's driving me crazy,"" said Dr. Joseph R. Lauro, an emergency physician affiliated with Brown University. ""It's something that we can do. It's something that's been studied. It's something that happens elsewhere. So why the hell aren't we doing it?""
Rhode Island public safety officials have defended the way their system is set up, pointing out that call-takers are certified in CPR and basic first aid. A spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety said in an email that officials were prohibited from discussing specifics of the 911 call involving Alijah, citing state confidentiality laws. The agency also declined to answer questions about the call-taker, who was not identified in the recording.
The final autopsy report, which Barbara shared with The Public's Radio, said the baby had been propped on his left side with a bottle in his bassinet. ""He was later found unresponsive on his back.""
The report states the cause of death as ""sudden unexplained infant death.""
Doctors who reviewed the 911 call, Alijah's autopsy report and a patient care report prepared by the local fire department said it's impossible to know whether Alijah would have survived with earlier intervention.
Throughout the investigation of Alijah's death, the baby's aunt, Jessica, said nobody asked them about the emergency response to their 911 call or told them it had been mishandled.
""I mean, there were a million other questions,"" Jessica said. ""But no one ever said, 'You know, what was the 911 call like? Did they give you clear instructions?' ""
Barbara shook her head. ""Not once,"" she said. ""None of them.""

Spring Allergies? Sublingual Immunotherapy Tablets Might Help : Shots - Health News,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/08/710243786/seasonal-sniffles-immunotherapy-tablets-can-replace-allergy-shots-for-some-aller?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image A new treatment for allergies is gaining popularity.

toggle caption Getty Images A new treatment for allergies is gaining popularity. Sublingual immunotherapy works to tame the immune response, much like allergy shots.
Getty Images Sneezing, runny nose, congestion, or irritated eyes? Yes, we hear you: The misery of seasonal allergies is real. A lot of people find temporary relief with over-the-counter medications, but these don't treat the cause.
As we head into grass pollen season over the next few months, here's an option to consider: Many allergists now prescribe immunotherapy tablets, which work in the same way as allergy shots, to some of their patients with grass allergies.
But unlike allergy shots, which require frequent trips to the doctor, you can take the tablets at home. ""It's a little wafer you put under your tongue, and it dissolves in about 10 seconds,"" says allergist Mike Tankersley , who practices in Memphis, Tenn.
The treatment, known as sublingual immunotherapy, or SLIT, is more convenient than shots and has been shown to be safe . But it won't work for everyone. Each tablet targets just one allergy. There are four FDA-approved tablet products on the market to treat grass pollens, house dust mites and ragweed.
""I've had several patients who have been very happy with having something to take at home,"" Tankersley says.
According to a recent survey by the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, 73 percent of allergists now prescribe these immunotherapy tablets to some of their patients. Since these products were approved, starting five years ago, ""there's been a significant change in practice in the United States,"" Tankersley says.
Tankersley, who also serves as vice chair of the ACAAI's Committee on Immunotherapy and Diagnostics, says he still recommends allergy shots to the majority of patients because most of them have multiples allergies. Shots can be formulated to target all of the allergies in one shot.
Tankersley says he recommends this quiz from ACAAI for patients trying to decide whether shots or tablets are the best option.
Like allergy shots, the tablets are a form of immunotherapy, which can alter your immune system. It's a complex response, but one part of what's going on when you take the shots or tablets is your body can produce regulatory cells ""that suppress the immune response,"" explains Harold Nelson , an allergist and immunologist at National Jewish Health in Denver. In other words, immunotherapy can put a cap on the immune reaction and tamp down symptoms.
Over the very long term, Nelson says, when immunotherapy works well, ""the whole balance in the immune system is restored to pretty much that which is seen in non-allergic people.""
The tablets work best if you have just one or two main allergies that bother you. For instance, if grass pollen is your problem, there are two tablet products to fight grass allergies.
""If you live in a place like the Willamette Valley of Oregon or Northern California where grass is the predominant allergen, and that's what really bothers you, then the tablets are great,"" Nelson says.
The pollen from ragweed, which is found in many regions of the U.S., causes allergy symptoms in up to 23 million people. And the ragweed tablet has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment . Similarly, house dust mite allergies — which don't have much of a seasonal ebb and flow — can be treated effectively with the dust mite tablet, according to research . The grass pollen tablets are approved for adults and children (age 5 and older). The ragweed and dust mite tablets are approved for people 18 and older.
So far, there's no sublingual immunotherapy approved in the U.S. for tree pollen, which drives early spring allergies. In Europe, there's a tablet developed to treat birch allergies , which Nelson says could potentially be effective against some oak allergies. And in Japan there's an approved tablet for Japanese cedar, which might be effective in treating some cedar and juniper allergies seen in the U.S. Tankersley says allergists are hopeful that over the next several years a tablet for some tree pollen allergies may be available in the U.S.
What if you have two main allergies that bother you? Say, grass allergies in the late spring or summer and ragweed , which is often called hay fever and tends to spike in mid-September. Can you take both tablets? ""Yes, you can,"" says Nelson.
There's evidence for both safety and efficacy , Nelson explains, for taking two immunotherapy tablets simultaneously. But typically the tablets are started at different times, Nelson says. One drawback is that some insurance plans won't cover two tablets at the same time. However, with tablets, you don't have the copay that may come with office visits.
Many people get allergy relief with over-the-counter nasal steroids such as Flonase and Nasacort and anti-histamines. And Tankersley says they can be effective at treating symptoms. But unlike allergy shots and immunotherapy tablets, these medicines don't address the root cause of the problem.
""That's the big advantage of immunotherapy,"" he says. ""We're really shooting for a cure."""

Charles Krupa/AP Updated at 5:07 p.m. ET
Thirteen parents and one coach charged in the college admissions scandal will plead guilty, federal prosecutors announced Monday. One of the parents is Felicity Huffman, the actress who is among the best known of the wealthy individuals arrested in the cheating case that broke last month.
The 14 defendants were all charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest-services mail fraud. They have agreed to plead guilty in accordance with plea agreements.
Authorities charged 50 people in the scheme, in which parents allegedly paid millions of dollars in a conspiracy with William ""Rick"" Singer to have their children's test scores and athletic achievements falsified to secure admission to elite colleges.
At least two of those colleges, Yale University and Stanford University , have since revoked their offers of admission to students involved in the case.
Law Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin Appear In Court Over College Admissions Scandal Education USC Suspends Accounts Of Students Allegedly Linked To Admissions Bribery Scandal Michael Center, 54, the former head men's tennis coach at the University of Texas at Austin, is among those slated to plead guilty. Prosecutors say he accepted $60,000 in cash from Singer, as well as $40,000 earmarked for the University of Texas' tennis program, in exchange for designating one of Singer's clients as a tennis recruit.
The Department of Justice says 11 of the defendants will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest-services mail fraud:
1. Gregory Abbott, 68, of New York, N.Y., together with his wife, Marcia, agreed to pay Singer $125,000 to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme for their daughter;
2. Marcia Abbott, 59, of New York, N.Y.;
3. Jane Buckingham, 50, of Beverly Hills, Calif., agreed to pay Singer $50,000 to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme for her son;
4. Gordon Caplan, 52, of Greenwich, Conn., agreed to pay Singer $75,000 to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme for his daughter;
5. Robert Flaxman, 62, of Laguna Beach, Calif., agreed to pay Singer $75,000 to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme for his daughter;
6. Felicity Huffman, 56, of Los Angeles, Calif., agreed to pay Singer at least $15,000 to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme for her oldest daughter;
7. Agustin Huneeus Jr., 53, of San Francisco, Calif., agreed to pay Singer $300,000 to participate in both the college entrance exam cheating scheme and the college recruitment scheme for his daughter;
8. Marjorie Klapper, 50, of Menlo Park, Calif., agreed to pay Singer $15,000 to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme for her son;
9. Peter Jan Sartorio, 53, of Menlo Park, Calif., agreed to pay Singer $15,000 to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme for his daughter;
10. Stephen Semprevivo, 53, of Los Angeles, Calif., agreed to pay Singer $400,000 to participate in the college recruitment scheme for his son; and
11. Devin Sloane, 53, of Los Angeles, Calif., agreed to pay Singer $250,000 to participate in the college recruitment scheme for his son.
Two other defendants, Bruce Isackson, 61, and Davina Isackson, 55, of Hillsborough, Calif., will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest-services mail fraud. Bruce Isackson will also plead guilty to a count of money laundering conspiracy and one count of conspiracy to defraud the IRS. The Isacksons allegedly paid Singer $600,000 in schemes for both of their daughters and then deducted the bribes as charitable donations.
While the mail fraud charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or more, the plea deals make clear that the defendants are unlikely to face penalties so severe.
In Huffman's case, prosecutors recommended incarceration at the ""low end"" of the sentencing guidelines, a $20,000 fine, 12 months of probation and restitution in an amount to be determined.
The court is not required to follow the calculations laid out in the deal, and the plea agreement dictates that Huffman may not withdraw her guilty plea if she disagrees with the court's ultimate calculations or sentence.
Huffman released a statement of apology on Monday in which she said she is ""ashamed"" of the pain she caused her daughter and others:
""I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions.
""I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.
""My daughter knew absolutely nothing about my actions, and in my misguided and profoundly wrong way, I have betrayed her. This transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life. My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty.""
Plea hearings in the case have not yet been scheduled. The defendants who improperly took tax deductions for the bribes they paid have agreed to cooperate with the IRS to pay back taxes, prosecutors say."

Susan Walsh/AP Climate change is often thought of as a partisan issue in the United States, but New York Times journalist Nathaniel Rich says that wasn't always the case.
Rich says that from 1979 until 1989, climate change was viewed as a bipartisan problem — then the the oil industry ""descended and bared its fangs"" and everything changed.
Goats and Soda It's 2050 And This Is How We Stopped Climate Change In his new book, Losing Earth , Rich writes that in the late 1980s, the American Petroleum Institute began paying scientists to write op-eds questioning climate science. He describes the effort as a campaign to ""sow propaganda [and] disinformation, to buy off politicians and scientists, and, ultimately, to convert an entire political party to denialism.""
Rich says the campaign paid off. No longer was climate science accepted as fact: ""All of a sudden,"" he says, ""you have a number of pieces that start to appear that say maybe there's not scientific consensus about this problem.""
World Photos: Youth Climate Change Demonstrations Across The World As a result, the Republican party began to shift its stance on climate change: ""It's become a starkly partisan issue,"" Rich says. ""And it seems like we are much further from a solution than we were 30 years ago.""
Interview highlights On oil industry research into climate science
The industry has been following this issue for a long time. There are studies from Exxon or even Humble Oil, the predecessor to Exxon, going back into the mid-1950s and even then, those studies were not about whether or not this was happening. The question was how much of the added CO2 in the atmosphere was because of Exxon — basically because of the fossil fuel industry. They continued to monitor this over the decades.
On how the American Petroleum Institute helped create a 'debate' around climate change
Book Reviews New Climate Books Stress We Are Already Far Down The Road To A Different Earth The head of the API program told me they gave $2,000 to a scientist whenever he wrote an op-ed for a national publication. That is almost an afterthought at the time. It's pretty low on the totem pole of what they're doing. They're also meeting with Congressmen and so on. But it pays enormous dividends, because all of a sudden national news publications start quoting these scientists — it's really a handful of people, four or five people — over and over again. And an issue that, at this point, has been a story about fear of what's going to happen, all of a sudden has two sides.

We've entered this weird funhouse realm where now if you jump ahead to the present day you have a political party ... that endorses a position that's essentially to the right even of what the industry now says in their public statements. Exxon publicly today doesn't deny climate change, but you have a party that does. I think it's something that future historians will spend a lot of time piecing out is: How this little lie grew into a big lie and overwhelmed our politics.

Amazon Independent Booksellers On a major turning point that occurred in 1989 when George H.W. Bush declined to sign a United Nations treaty addressing climate change
From '79 to '89 there are a series of escalating efforts to first bring the issue to the attention of the powers that be — people at the highest levels of the federal government — and then to bring it into the public to generate public concern. And finally, in the middle of the decade, a solution materializes which is a global treaty to reduce emissions that would be binding, and it's modeled after the ozone treaty, that's then in process.
By the end of the decade we've reached the point of high level diplomatic meetings to negotiate this binding global treaty. We get to the precipice of an agreement on the framework of this treaty, and at the very last second the U.S. pulls out. ... At least on paper that's the closest we've come.
I think you could have a reasonable debate about whether or not if the U.S. did sign the treaty we would've lived up to the terms of it, whether other countries would have lived up to the terms of it even if it was binding. And that's a more complicated conversation to have. I think at the very least we'd be a lot further ahead than we are now. That seems indisputable.
On what the Trump administration has done to undermine environmental protections
[Trump's] trying to roll back just about every policy that President Obama introduced, trying to roll back clean air standards, emissions from coal factories, mileage standards, CAFE standards they're called. You name it — an all-out assault, and not just on climate, but on any kind of environmental protection, I should say. I guess the only silver lining is that [with] something like the Paris Accord, he can he can withdraw, but the formal withdrawal doesn't happen for a couple of years, and even then the treaty is voluntary to begin with, so it's more of a political statement than anything else.
Rolling back emission standards is probably at the top of the list of the bad things that are going on. But I think more destructive is just this peddling of this fantasy, and it's connected to a lot of other stuff you see in the administration: a basic affront on objective reality. You see that extends beyond the climate conversation and into, the conversation we're having about news and reporting and historical fact and all the rest.
Climate change victimizes the victimized. It oppresses the oppressed. ... It cuts along class lines, racial lines, generational lines and socioeconomic lines. So the worse off you are, the more marginalized you are, the worse you're going to suffer from what's coming.
Nathaniel Rich
On what's new about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey's Green New Deal proposal
It's a statement of principles. Primarily it's not a law. It's not a bill. ... In some of the particulars, it's less ambitious than bills that were proposed and introduced into Congress at the end of the '80s by both Republicans and Democrats. I think what distinguishes it — and what makes it a truly transformational document — is that it identifies the climate crisis as connected to every form, essentially, of social injustice that we have. I think that's the only honest way of looking at it.
Climate change victimizes the victimized. It oppresses the oppressed. ... It cuts along class lines, racial lines, generational lines and socioeconomic lines. So the worse off you are, the more marginalized you are, the worse you're going to suffer from what's coming.
So [the Green New Deal is] extremely valuable in that it says that climate change is not just one item on this sort of menu of political items, but it's the one that encompasses them all. You can't have social justice if there's not climate justice. You can't have a civil society, a stable society, if you don't have a stable climate.
I think that's a profound argument and an honest one. It puts it into moral terms in a way that is new in Washington, and I think that is enormously valuable. You can get into the debate about how best to achieve certain goals — and those are important policy debates to have — but it's reframed the issue dramatically and I think critically.
On how to motivate Americans to care about climate change
This has been a big debate, particularly within the activist community, for a while now. It's essentially a marketing question: How do we get people to care about this problem and prioritize it? Is fear the best approach? Is hope? Inspiring people? I think that the trend has been towards the latter more.
Environment Concern About Global Warming Among Americans Spikes, Report Says ... We think of it almost in, like, Hollywood terms, like either we're going to win this thing, or we're going to suffer a crushing defeat. But, of course, there's a huge range of outcomes in between, and at this point where we're at — ranging from the not very good to the apocalyptic — but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to better our situation as much as possible.

House Judiciary Leaders Unite In Call For Mueller Hearing; Unclear If He'd Appear,www.npr.org,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711124870/house-judiciary-leaders-unite-in-call-for-mueller-hearing-unclear-if-hed-appear,"Enlarge this image Special counsel Robert Mueller, center, leaves after a closed meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 21, 2017, at the Capitol in Washington, D.C. Alex Wong/Getty Alex Wong/Getty Images Special counsel Robert Mueller, center, leaves after a closed meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 21, 2017, at the Capitol in Washington, D.C.
Alex Wong/Getty Images The leaders of the House Judiciary Committee agreed on Monday to call special counsel Robert Mueller to appear for a hearing. The question now is whether Mueller would agree.
Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., the panel's ranking member, opened the bidding with a letter in which he asked the chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., to invite Mueller to testify later this month.
Although the committee expects to hear from Attorney General William Barr, Collins wrote, it must go to the source to learn all it needs to know about the special counsel inquiry.
Wrote Collins :
Attorney General Barr was never a part of this investigation, and instead simply reviewed the special counsel's final report and has provided Congress, so far, with the special counsel's principal conclusions. While he can testify surrounding his decision to provide the committee with principal conclusions, it is special counsel Mueller who is best positioned to testify regarding the underlying facts and material in which you are so interested.
Collins asked Nadler, who leads the Democratic majority that has the power to convene hearings, to invite Mueller to appear during the week of April 22.
Nadler responded on Twitter later in the day with a post that said he agrees Mueller should talk with the judiciary committee, but at the right time.
But first, Nadler wants Mueller's work product — all of it, including the underlying evidence in addition to the findings in his report — and then Nadler wants to hear from Barr. Only then, the chairman said, would members be prepared to question the special counsel himself.
In order to ask Special Counsel Mueller the right questions, the Committee must receive the Special Counsel’s full report and hear from Attorney General Barr about that report on May 2. We look forward to hearing from Mr. Mueller at the appropriate time. 2/2
— (((Rep. Nadler))) (@RepJerryNadler) April 8, 2019 The Justice Department declined to comment on the requests by the members of Congress.
Prospect for historic hearing
If Mueller does appear for a public hearing, it could be a spectacle equal to or greater than that afforded by earlier witnesses such as former FBI James Comey and others in the Russia imbroglio, some of whom brought life in parts of the U.S. to a standstill as Americans were transfixed by their testimony.
National Security What Else Could Robert Mueller's Report Reveal About Trump And Russia? Despite one of the highest profile roles in official Washington in recent memory, Mueller is a sphinx. He has barely spoken in public since his appointment in the spring of 2017 and his office has made very few comments in the press.
National Security Mueller Report Doesn't Find Russian Collusion, But Can't 'Exonerate' On Obstruction Mostly the special counsel's office has let its work do the talking, including in criminal charges against more than 30 individuals and, most recently, in a more than 400-page report that was briefly summarized by Barr in a four-page letter for members of Congress last month.
That was where Barr wrote that Mueller's investigation did not establish a conspiracy between President Trump's campaign and the Russian interference in the 2016 election .
National Security What You Need To Know About The Russia Investigations: Alleged Obstruction Nor, Barr wrote , did Mueller establish that Trump had committed an obstruction-of-justice offense in the way he dealt with investigators, although the nature of that conclusion has raised many questions from Democrats.
Politics House Judiciary Approves Subpoena For Full Mueller Report In Party-Line Vote That's why Nadler and his colleagues say they're so eager to see Mueller's full findings and discoveries, without relying on the interpretation provided by the attorney general.
Barr has said his office is working on redacting Mueller's report so that sensitive and confidential information can be excised and a copy given to Congress and the public, perhaps sometime within the next two weeks.
Nadler and Democrats say they won't be satisfied with a redacted copy; they want Mueller's full conclusions and his full supporting material. Judiciary committee members have voted to authorize Nadler to subpoena that material if necessary.

toggle caption Mahmud Turkia/AFP/Getty Images Forces loyal to the internationally recognized Libyan Government of National Accord drive through Tripoli's old airport on Monday. Elsewhere, Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar's forces struck the city's lone functioning civilian airport, part of his offensive against the capital.
Mahmud Turkia/AFP/Getty Images Rapidly escalating violence is limiting civilians' ability to travel in and out of Libya's capital. An airstrike on Tripoli's international airport Monday and other recent clashes have now forced some 3,400 people to leave their homes, according to the U.N.'s Humanitarian Affairs office.
""Clashes with heavy weapons are affecting residential areas, and an unknown additional number of civilians are unable to flee these locations,"" the office said Monday .
The fighting intensified over the weekend, as soldiers loyal to Khalifa Haftar — the former army chief who now leads the Libyan National Army — neared the capital. Haftar, who is aligned with Gaddafi regime loyalists, has amassed power and resources in eastern Libya. Last week, he launched an offensive to the west, aiming to take control of the capital.
The death toll from the clashes has risen to at least 51, the Associated Press reports — citing a figure that includes both civilian and military casualties.
Relief workers are warning of a wide range of potential risks, from emergency aid that's been blocked by the fighting to possible long-term damage to the city's infrastructure. It's the latest sign of renewed instability in Libya, where conflict and political uncertainty have lingered since 2011.
As he pressed his fight against the U.N.-backed central Government of National Accord, or GNA, Haftar launched an air strike on the city's lone functioning civilian airport, Mitiga, on Monday.
The attack ""constitutes a serious violation of international humanitarian law which prohibits attacks against civilian infrastructure,"" the U.N. Support Mission in Libya said .
Africa U.N. Urges An End To Fighting In Libya As Opposition Army Heads Toward Tripoli ""The U.N. humanitarian office has recorded four civilian deaths over the past two days,"" Lisa Schlein reports for NPR from Geneva. ""Among the victims were two medical doctors who were killed during the clashes. U.N. agencies say they have stocks of food and emergency medical supplies in locations throughout Tripoli and can respond rapidly to a possible upsurge in humanitarian needs.""
The World Health Organization condemned the doctors' killing, saying it was the latest in a string of violence that has either damaged or closed more than 20 hospitals over the years.
""These doctors risked their lives to evacuate wounded patients from conflict areas,"" said WHO Regional Director Dr. Ahmed Al Mandhari , ""and targeting them and health facilities at such times worsens the situation for civilians caught up in conflict.""
On Sunday, the deteriorating situation in Libya prompted U.S. Africa Command to announce it had ""temporarily relocated"" a contingent of U.S. forces.
""The security realities on the ground in Libya are growing increasingly complex and unpredictable,"" said Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the Marine Corps commander of Africa Command . ""Even with an adjustment of the force, we will continue to remain agile in support of existing U.S. strategy.
Haftar agreed to meet with U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres last Friday . But after that meeting, Guterres said he was leaving Libya ""with a deep concern and a heavy heart.""
Both the U.N. and the U.S. insist that a political process — not a military clash — is the only solution that will give Libya a lasting peace and functioning government.
""We have made clear that we oppose the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday ."

Kirstjen Nielsen's DHS Departure Means 3 Major Departments Will Have Acting Secretaries : NPR,www.npr.org,Mara Liasson,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169740/kirstjen-nielsens-dhs-departure-means-3-major-departments-will-have-acting-secre,"After the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, President Trump's Cabinet has numerous vacancies filled with acting appointees.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Now, Nielsen is not the only high-level Homeland Security official to lose a job in the last 24 hours. Earlier today, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders announced that Secret Service Director Randolph Tex Alles will be replaced next month after two years on the job. It's just the latest upheaval in the sprawling Department of Homeland Security.
Joining us now to explain what has been going down is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hey, Mara.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.
CHANG: So is the departure of the Secret Service director connected to Kirstjen Nielsen's firing?
LIASSON: I think it's connected in one way. President Trump has decided to do a general housecleaning at the Department of Homeland Security. And it's not just Secretary Nielsen or Tex Alles. There are several other DHS leaders who are expected to leave soon, including the general counsel and the head of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. And these are all people who were brought in by John Kelly when he was the head of DHS before he became the White House chief of staff. And Donald Trump wants to put his own stamp on the agency.
CHANG: Yeah.
LIASSON: I'm also told by White House officials the Secret Service director was not connected to security questions at Mar-a-Lago. It was in the works before the latest security breach there - Chinese woman with a lot of passports and hard drives.
CHANG: Right.
LIASSON: But - so this is not necessarily directly connected to immigration unlike Nielsen's resignation, which was immigration-related.
CHANG: Well, let's talk about Nielsen's resignation. How much blame are President Trump and his allies putting on Nielsen for the spike in border crossings lately?
LIASSON: Well, the president puts a lot of blame on her for this. They clashed. She really tried hard to advocate for his goals on the border, but she had a hard time turning them into effective policy. Sometimes she would push back and say, this is unconstitutional, or, there are laws preventing you from doing this. But the White House is bracing for bad numbers showing that the surge in illegal border crossings has gone up. It was 76,000 in February. And experts say that it's going to be close to a hundred thousand for March.
CHANG: Wow.
LIASSON: So clearly the president's goal of trying to stop immigration - legal, illegal, whatever - is not working.
CHANG: All right, well, Nielsen's being replaced by Kevin McAleenan, who's currently in charge of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Tell us a little more about him. Is he in the running to become the permanent secretary?
LIASSON: No, he's not. He's a career CBP official. He was already in place when the Trump administration came in. He's not known as an immigration hardliner. As a matter of fact, he's told the Senate that he thought the United States should support governments in Central America to improve economic opportunities there - in other words, to take away the motivation for people to flee. He's also talked about asylum-seekers as vulnerable families, not as scam artists. Sometimes the president describes them that way. But he's not going to have a lot of say in policy. That comes from Trump and his inner-circle of advisers at the White House, particularly Stephen Miller, who has the loudest voice on immigration...
CHANG: Yeah.
LIASSON: ...Inside the White House.
CHANG: Now, a lot of people are noticing that McAleenan will be the third acting secretary running a major cabinet department. Interior and Defense are also being run by acting secretaries. And I'm not even including the scores of lower-level acting officials in this administration. Is this as unusual as it seems?
LIASSON: Well, it certainly is breaking records for this kind of thing. But Donald Trump has said he likes having acting secretaries. He gives them more flexibility. His critics would say that's 'cause he wants all these people on a short leash. But this is clearly what the president wants.
CHANG: All right, that's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks so much, Mara.
LIASSON: Thank you.

Libya Could Descend Into War Again After Army General Launches Surprise Attack On Tripoli : NPR,www.npr.org,Jane Arraf,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169747/libya-could-descend-into-war-again-after-army-general-launches-surprise-attack-o,"Libya is once again facing instability as a renegade general leads forces attempting to oust the internationally-recognized government in Tripoli.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Libya, with its patchwork of militias and a weak central government, could be descending again into war. An Army general who controls part of the country has launched a surprise attack on the capital, Tripoli. The U.S. and other countries are evacuating soldiers and staff now. NPR's Jane Arraf has been following all of this from Amman, Jordan.
Hi, Jane.
JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Hi.
CHANG: So can you just describe what exactly is happening now in Tripoli?
ARRAF: So there are these forces that are advancing on the capital. And they had reached the disused airport on the outskirts of the capital. But now there's actually been an airstrike on the only functioning airport. Now, these are forces that have made their way to the outskirts of the city and now going into the center. Dozens of people have been killed, including civilians and soldiers. Almost 3,000 of them have been displaced. There are real concerns that this is actually the start of something. The U.N.'s special envoy for Libya says that they are effectively on the brink of what could be civil war.
CHANG: And this general, Khalifa Haftar, can you tell us a little bit more about him? Who is he?
ARRAF: He is a general who helped to bring deposed leader Moammar Gadhafi to power way back in 1969, and then they had a falling out. And he ends up in exile in the United States where he basically lived plotting to topple Gadhafi until Gadhafi was indeed toppled and killed in 2011. Then he came back. He gathered forces, and he actually took over part of the country, eastern Libya, including Benghazi.
This is a general who has the backing of the United Arab Emirates, which is important because they have a lot of money. He also has the backing of Egypt. So last week, after multiple threats, he popped up to announce that, indeed, this was it; he had ordered his forces to advance to take control of Tripoli, the capital.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
LIBYAN NATIONAL ARMY KHALIFA HAFTAR: (Through interpreter) Today we respond to the appeal of our people and our precious capital as we promised them. Their patience has reached an end. Today is our date with destiny to respond to the call of truth, an end to struggle and suffering and pain.
ARRAF: He's saying there that, basically, he was responding to the appeal of people in the capital saying they wanted him to come and, as he put it, liberate them. And he called it an appointment with destiny.
CHANG: Now, we mentioned that countries, including the U.S., are pulling their citizens out of Libya. Can you just tell us about that and what U.S. troops have been doing there?
ARRAF: So Libya really hasn't effectively been under control of any one party or any one government since 2011 basically - since Gadhafi was toppled. And that's made it particularly dangerous. There are ISIS-affiliated groups operating there, al-Qaida-affiliated groups. The U.S. has special forces operating there doing counterterrorism. So on the weekend, the U.S. military pulled out a contingent of troops. The Defense Department said the security was too uncertain to keep them there. And others have pulled out as well. The Italian oil company which is a big player in Libya's huge oil industry has evacuated its expat staff - its expatriate staff. India has pulled out peacekeepers. People are very, very nervous.
CHANG: So let's say the U.N.'s special envoy is correct. Let's say that this does get worse in Libya. What would be the regional impact?
ARRAF: Well, we saw in Benghazi in 2012 when militants attacked the U.S. diplomatic mission there and they killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, that this is really a country that has the potential to go very, very bad. There are all these militant groups operating there. It's a major oil producer. It's of particular concern to Europe because it's a major transit point for migrants and refugees crossing the Mediterranean from Libya to try to get to Europe.
So this is a country that really hasn't been stable. It's very precarious security. There's an internationally recognized government in Tripoli now under threat. So the implications of what happens if General Haftar manages to take the capital - those implications are very serious for what happens not just to Libya but security in the region.
CHANG: Yeah. That's NPR's Jane Arraf. Thank you, Jane.
ARRAF: Thank you very much.

Phil Fisk/Cultura RF/Getty Images Phil Fisk/Cultura RF/Getty Images According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, incidents of serious workplace violence are four times more common in health care than in private industry. Most assaults come from patients and patients' families.
Phil Fisk/Cultura RF/Getty Images Across the U.S., many doctors, nurses and other health care workers have remained silent about what is being called an epidemic of violence against them.
The violent outbursts come from patients and patients' families. And for years, it has been considered part of the job.
When you visit the Cleveland Clinic emergency department these days — whether as a patient, family member or friend — a large sign directs you toward a metal detector.
An officer inspects all bags and then instructs you to walk through the metal detector. In some cases, a metal wand is used — even on patients who come in on stretchers. Cleveland Clinic officials say they confiscate thousands of weapons like knives, pepper spray and guns each year. The metal detectors were installed in response to what CEO Tom Mihaljevic is calling an epidemic.
Shots - Health News 5 Years After A Murder, Calif. Hospital Still Struggles With Violence ""There is a very fundamental problem in U.S. health care that very few people speak about,"" he says, ""and that's the violence against health care workers. Daily — literally, daily — we are exposed to violent outbursts, in particular in emergency rooms.""
Many health care workers say the physical and verbal abuse comes primarily from patients, some of whom are disoriented because of illness or from medication. Sometimes nurses and doctors are abused by family members who are on edge because their loved one is so ill.
Cleveland Clinic also has introduced other safety measures — such as wireless panic buttons incorporated into ID badges and more safety cameras and plainclothes officers in ERs.
But these incidents aren't limited to emergency rooms.
Allysha Shin works as a registered nurse in neuroscience intensive care at the University of Southern California's Keck Hospital in Los Angeles. One of the most violent incidents she has experienced happened when she was caring for a patient who was bleeding inside her brain.
The woman had already lashed out at other staff, so she had been tied to the bed, Shin said. She broke free of the restraints and then kicked and punched Shin in the chest — before throwing a punch at her face.
""There was this one point where she swung, and she had just glanced off the side of my chin. If I hadn't dodged that punch, she could have knocked me out,"" Shin says. ""And she very well could have killed me.""
The encounter left Shin shaken and anxious when she returned to work days later. She still has flashbacks.
She used to be afraid to speak about these types of attacks, she says, because of what she calls a culture of accepting violence in most hospitals. ""It is expected that you are going to get beat up from time to time,"" Shin says.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, incidents of serious workplace violence are four times more common in health care than in private industry. And a poll conducted by the American College of Emergency Physicians in 2018 found nearly half of emergency physician respondents reported being physically assaulted. More than 60 percent of them said the assault occurred within the previous year.
Groups representing doctors and nurses say while the voluntary safety improvements that some hospitals have enacted are a good first step, more needs to be done.
Violence At California's Psychiatric Hospitals In Calif. Mental Hospitals, Assaults Rarely A Crime There is still a code of silence in health care, says Michelle Mahon, a representative of the labor group National Nurses United. ""What happens if they do report it?"" she says. ""In some cases, unfortunately, they are treated as if they are the ones who don't know how to do their job. Or that it's their fault that this happened.""
""There's a lot of focus on de-escalation techniques,"" Mahon adds. ""Those are helpful tools, but oftentimes they are used to blame workers.""
In California, the nurses' labor union pushed for a law giving OSHA more authority to monitor hospital safety. The group is now backing a national effort to do the same thing. ""The standard that we are recommending federally holds the employer responsible,"" Mahon says. ""It mandates reporting of incidents and transparency.""
The Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act , recently introduced in Congress, would require hospitals to implement plans to prevent violence. And any hospital could face fines for not reporting incidents to OSHA, Mahon adds.
The goal of the legislation — and of the union — is to hold administrators more accountable for acts of violence in their hospitals."

Felicity Huffman And 13 Others Plead Guilty In College Admissions Scandal,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169754/felicity-huffman-and-13-others-plead-guilty-in-college-admissions-scandal,"Thirteen parents and one university athletic coach have agreed to plead guilty to charges of mail fraud and honest services mail fraud in connect with the college admissions scandal.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
One sports coach and 13 parents have agreed to plead guilty in the college admissions scandal that federal investigators have called Operation Varsity Blues. One of them - Felicity Huffman, the star of the show ""Desperate Housewives."" Anya Kamenetz of NPR's Education team has been following the story and joins us now. Hi, Anya.
ANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.
SHAPIRO: Tell us about this latest development with more than a dozen parents agreeing to plead guilty.
KAMENETZ: So the parents as well as one coach have agreed to plead guilty in connection with this scheme. And according to one of the plea agreements at least, they may serve a few months in jail as well as paying fines and restitution. And Felicity Huffman, the actress, as you heard, is one of the more high-profile people accused. But others, including Lori Loughlin, another actress from the TV show ""Full House,"" is among those originally accused who is continuing to fight the charges.
SHAPIRO: What are we hearing from the parents?
KAMENETZ: Well, two of those who plead - pled guilty today issued very contrite statements. Huffman's statement reportedly said, I am in full acceptance of my guilt - deep regret and shame. And she also reiterated that her daughter had no idea.
SHAPIRO: This story has gotten so much attention, and it seems to have really resonated with students and parents. Why do you think it has had such a big impact?
KAMENETZ: In a word, Ari - schadenfreude. I think at this moment, whether you look at politics or society in general, there is a lot of concern about fraud, about misrepresentation, people not being who they say they are, not to mention a lot of resentment of wealth and privilege and all the trappings that come with it. And the way this story has unfolded, the fact that these families really seem to believe that the rules should not apply to them - that's been galling to many people.
And then look at the setting, right? So elite colleges are the source of such cultural fascination. Some would say obsession. Highly selective colleges - you know, they only enroll about 1 percent of all college students. So they're very, very small. But then again, they have these brands that are known all over the world. And they're supposed to stand for merit, for hard work, for the best and the brightest.
And so when you look at something like this or, even bigger, the legacy admissions or the fact that some wealthy donors can write a check and get their kid into college that way supposedly, it - all of this is really going to undermine the idea of having institutions in our society that represent hard work and being kind of excellent.
SHAPIRO: So where do these cases go from here?
KAMENETZ: Well, you know, this is having a lot of different effects. So you know, some of the students have been expelled. Their admissions have been revoked. Some of the coaches have been fired. They face charges - athletic coaches who were involved in misrepresenting people as being recruits. And of course the legal cases are going to continue to unfold.
But I'm also interested in how it's unfolding in the broader culture at large. You know, whether you look at things like - we had a big debate last year about Harvard and affirmative action. And these conversations about things like legacy admissions are really bringing us to a broader conversation about, what do these elite colleges really offer? You know, the fact that they have nonprofit status - are they really serving the public, or are they just acting in a way that's really inflating their own bottom line and their own brands?
And so I think there's a broader conversation about, are there better ways to have admissions? And can we define excellence in education some other way other than, you know, something that's really expensive and only lets in about 5 percent of people who get to apply?
SHAPIRO: And for all that conversation, just in our last 30 seconds or so, do you see signs of systemic change coming?
KAMENETZ: I think that it's going to be a huge debate. I look forward to it in the presidential election, honestly.
SHAPIRO: NPR's Anya Kamenetz, thanks a lot.
KAMENETZ: Thanks, Ari.

Can Artificial Intelligence Make The Hiring Process More Fair? : NPR,www.npr.org,Maddy Savage,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169794/can-artificial-intelligence-make-the-hiring-process-more-fair,"One of Sweden's biggest recruiters plans to use Artificial Intelligence-powered robots to conduct job interviews as a way to curb bias in the hiring process.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Can artificial intelligence make the hiring process fairer? We look at that question in All Tech Considered.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SHAPIRO: Lots of Fortune 500 companies use some sort of AI to screen job candidates. In Sweden, recruiters are testing an AI-powered recruitment robot. Reporter Maddy Savage went to check it out.
MADDY SAVAGE, BYLINE: I'm outside the offices of TNG, one of Sweden's largest recruiting companies, which has a glass-fronted office in downtown Stockholm. And I'm waiting for Avni Dervishi, a job-seeker who's here to take part in trials of the firm's new robots.
AVNI DERVISHI: I have a master's degree in European politics, European affairs. I applied for quite many, many, many jobs. Some interviews I did manage to get, and I know that I did comply with the requirements.
SAVAGE: But Dervishi thinks he's missed out on being hired because of discrimination or unconscious bias. He's in his 40s and is originally from Kosovo.
DERVISHI: What I do think it's missing is more open-mindedness. Swedish people are cautious. They are careful.
SAVAGE: OK. Well, I'm going to leave you...
DERVISHI: OK.
SAVAGE: ...To try out this robot interview.
DERVISHI: All right.
SAVAGE: Best of luck.
DERVISHI: Thank you.
(SOUNDBITE OF DOOR CLOSING)
SAVAGE: Sweden has experienced record immigration in recent years. And the unemployment rate amongst people born abroad is around 19 percent, compared to just 4 percent of Swedes. To get some more context, I went for coffee with Matt Kriteman, an American living in Stockholm who works at a nonprofit that campaigns for inclusion in the labor market.
MATT KRITEMAN: Sweden is relatively new, comparatively speaking, with other countries that have been multicultural, for example, like, the U.S., from the beginning. We see more - growing pains is what we call it.
SAVAGE: What do you think about the idea of using AI or robots for recruitment?
KRITEMAN: We're in Stockholm, the tech startup capital of Europe. So we're really, really interested in this. At the same time, AI is only as good and as diverse as the people who create the algorithm.
SAVAGE: That's the programming instructions that determine how the robot will respond. The robot being used by TNG, called Tengai, has been given a female voice and interacts with candidates by means of a talking head. Her face glows, and she can even mimic human facial expressions like blinking and smiling.
COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: (Speaking Swedish).
SAVAGE: At the moment, she can only carry out job interviews in Swedish, but she is learning to speak English.
CHARLOTTE ULVROS: My name is Charlotte Ulvros, and I'm the chief marketing and experience officer. Tengai is an unbiased social robot to make sure that we find out who is the best candidate for the job, not anything that's connected to bias, for example, your looks or anything like that.
SAVAGE: She says TNG has sought to avoid any potential algorithm bias by ensuring a diverse group of recruiters and test candidates have been involved in training the robot. But most of the developers working on the project are men.
ULVROS: There could be, for example, sexist algorithms, but that's when we will use external experts, who will continuously check the code because we're so aware of this issue, and we're trying to do an unbiased product. And we need to keep on top of things.
SAVAGE: That's not the only concern. Dr. Malin Lindelow, a psychologist who specializes in recruitment, says there's much more to a job interview than just answering a list of questions.
MALIN LINDELOW: We have a lot of areas where there is lack of employees, so actually attracting candidates is a big issue. I'm concerned that it will be an impersonal and not-very-selling experience for the candidate. They need to meet the people they're going to work with in the future.
SAVAGE: Back at TNG, Avni Dervishi's just finished his job interview, and he's got mixed feelings.
DERVISHI: In the beginning, it felt like, is this sci-fi - science fiction? And at the end, it felt that I would like to see those robots start to be applicable in some working places which lack diversity but not take the jobs of the humans in charge of recruiting people.
SAVAGE: TNG plans to start using the robot in real job interviews for May, although it will still use human recruiters for second-round interviews. But her developers say they can see a future where robots like Tengai could eventually make the final call. For NPR News, I'm Maddy Savage in Stockholm.

Senators Set To Grill PBMs About Drug Costs : Shots - Health News,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/08/711139364/drug-industry-middlemen-to-be-questioned-by-senate-committee,"Enlarge this image Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, will lead the Senate Finance Committee's questioning Tuesday of executives from pharmacy benefit managers about drug costs. Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, will lead the Senate Finance Committee's questioning Tuesday of executives from pharmacy benefit managers about drug costs.
Win McNamee/Getty Images Consumers, lawmakers and industry players all seem to agree that prescription drugs prices are too high. What they can't always agree on is whom to blame.
On Tuesday, though, fingers are expected to point toward pharmacy benefit managers, the industry's mysterious middlemen.
The Senate Finance Committee will hear from executives from the biggest pharmacy benefit managers, led by CVS Caremark and Cigna's Express Scripts.
""They're kind of a secret organization,"" says Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, of the pharmacy benefit managers. ""I ask people to explain what they're doing and nobody seems to give you the same answer twice."" Grassley is chairman of the Finance Committee and Tuesday's hearing is its third on drug prices this year.
Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, manage prescription drug benefits for insurance companies and employers. And because they control the medication purchases of millions of patients, they are tremendously powerful.
""They exist only because pharmaceutical prices got so high and they were a way to get some market power in there that was on the consumer side,"" says Len Nichols, a health economist at George Mason University. ""Now they've become so big and dominant that they are hurting pharma.""
Shots - Health News VIDEO: Little-Known Middlemen Save Money On Medicines — But Maybe Not For You How dominant? CVS Caremark negotiates drug prices, copayments and which drugs are preferred options for more than 92 million people in the U.S. Express Scripts covers another 83 million.
The companies are hired by insurance companies, or self-insured employers, to control spending on prescription drugs. The PBMs negotiate discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, but those discounts come in the form of confidential rebates that are paid to the PBMs after the drugs are purchased.
PBMs pass most of the rebates on to their clients, but they often keep a slice for themselves.
The PBMs dispute that they are withholding savings from their clients. ""While drug manufacturers would have people believe that PBMs are retaining these discounts, virtually all rebates and discounts are passed on to clients,"" said Tom Moriarty, executive vice president at CVS Health, in a February speech.
Some analyses show that PBMs actually do help reduce drugs prices.
""PBMs have saved money over the last decade by encouraging use of generics,"" says Dr. Walid Gellad , director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh.
A report from SSR Health , an investment research firm, says the net prices of brand-name prescription drugs fell 4.8 percent in the last quarter of 2018, even while list prices rose 4 percent. The declines came as pharmacy benefit managers refused to pay for some drugs altogether, opting for a competing brand that offered a better price.
Gellad says that evidence is murky, because the rebate system means that many drugs start at prices that are artificially high.
But critics say the system creates perverse incentives for drugmakers to set high prices for their products so they can offer larger percentage rebates. And they say sometimes PBMs benefit more when patients buy expensive drugs than when they buy cheaper ones.
Now the entire business model is under attack. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar in February proposed eliminating the rebate system that underpins the work of companies like CVS Caremark and Express Scripts.
Instead, Azar proposed, the companies would use their market power to negotiate discounts from drugmakers upfront that would be passed on in full to patients.
In comments on HHS' proposal to get rid of rebates, CVS said drugmakers — not PBMs — are to blame. ""Our data show that it is not rebates that are causing drug prices to soar and, in fact, list price is increasing at a faster rate for many drugs with small rebates than for drugs with substantial rebates,"" CVS wrote. ""The elimination of rebates may not only lead to higher net drug prices, but will undoubtedly lead to higher premiums across the Medicare Part D program.""
Tuesday's hearing comes six weeks after the leaders of seven pharmaceutical manufacturers appeared before the same committee to defend their pricing practices.
Those CEOs acknowledged that their prices are high for many patients, but they deflected blame onto pharmacy benefit managers.
""We want these rebates, which lower net prices, to benefit patients,"" said Olivier Brandicourt , CEO of Sanofi, which makes Lantus, one of the highest priced brands of insulin . Its list price has risen from $244 to $431 since 2013, according to the committee.
Shots - Health News 'We're Fighting For Our Lives': Patients Protest Sky-High Insulin Prices ""Unfortunately, under the current system, savings from rebates are not consistently passed through to patients in the form of lower deductibles, co-payments or coinsurance amounts,"" Brandicourt said in testimony prepared for the hearing.
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, who is the ranking member of the Finance Committee, had harsh words for the drug makers at the February hearing.
""I think you and others in the industry are stonewalling on the key issue, which is actually lowering list prices,"" he said. ""Lowering those list prices is the easiest way for consumers to pay less at the pharmacy counter.""
Grassley is also frustrated.
""The pharmaceutical companies pointed the finger at the PBMs. The PBMs point their finger at the pharmaceuticals. And then both of those are pointing their fingers at the at the health insurance companies,"" Grassley said.
""I'm not announcing another hearing,"" he continued. ""But it might be that if we get this finger-pointing going on all the time, we may want to get those three groups all at the same table to stop the finger-pointing."""

AILSA CHANG, HOST:
The Trump administration has taken an unprecedented step in its bid to put pressure on Iran. It has designated part of Iran's military, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, as a foreign terrorist organization. NPR's Michele Kelemen reports on what that means.
MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says this is the first time the U.S. is putting part of another government on the same terrorism list that includes al-Qaida and ISIS.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MIKE POMPEO: We're doing it because the Iranian regime's use of terrorism as a tool of statecraft makes it fundamentally different from any other government.
KELEMEN: The U.S. accuses the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps of supporting militants across the Middle East - providing Iraqis, for example, with roadside bombs that killed hundreds of Americans during the Iraq War. Now anyone who supports the IRGC could face criminal charges.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
POMPEO: If you're the general counsel for a European financial institution today, there's more risk. It is absolutely the case that the IRGC amounts to a significant piece of the Iranian economy through pure kleptocracy.
KELEMEN: Advisers to President Trump say he wanted to take this step for a long time. Pentagon officials, though, have raised concerns about what this could mean on the ground. A former sanctions adviser, Elizabeth Rosenberg, puts it this way.
ELIZABETH ROSENBERG: People are concerned that it makes it more difficult to work together when necessary. Perhaps that means sharing information to make sure that there's not a military mishap.
KELEMEN: In Syria or Iraq, for instance. Rosenberg, who is with the Center for a New American Security, doesn't really see the upsides since the IRGC faced other sanctions already.
ROSENBERG: It doesn't change the amount of economic pressure on Iran, and it makes it harder to seek denouement or a climbdown with Iran in the future if political circumstances should make that feasible.
KELEMEN: The State Department's point person on Iran, Brian Hook, though, insists this move will not hamper diplomacy. He says the Middle East won't be stable unless the IRGC is weakened. A top Iranian official says the U.S. approach will fail.

GAO Says Replacing Dollar Bills With Coins Could Cost Billions : NPR,www.npr.org,Scott Horsley,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711162059/government-watchdog-flips-on-dollar-coin,"Enlarge this image A pile of newly minted $1 coins honoring former President Thomas Jefferson are unveiled by the U.S. Mint in Washington, D.C., in 2007. In a turnaround, congressional analysts are no longer recommending a phaseout of paper dollars in favor of a dollar coin. Jim Young/Reuters Jim Young/Reuters A pile of newly minted $1 coins honoring former President Thomas Jefferson are unveiled by the U.S. Mint in Washington, D.C., in 2007. In a turnaround, congressional analysts are no longer recommending a phaseout of paper dollars in favor of a dollar coin.
Jim Young/Reuters Who says a dollar doesn't go as far as it used to?
When it comes to dollar bills , a new report from the federal government says they're lasting more than twice as long as they were at the beginning of the decade.
And that's upending an old argument about replacing the dollar bill with a $1 coin.
Analysts have long argued that the federal government could save money by making the switch because even though coins cost more to mint, they last much longer than paper money. In 2011, the Government Accountability Office estimated the savings at $5.5 billion over 30 years.
Planet Money Should We Kill The Dollar Bill? But a second look from the GAO flips that coin argument on its head. Analysts now say the government would lose between $611 million and $2.6 billion over 30 years by phasing out the dollar bill. The economics have shifted because dollar bills are lasting longer.
""When we last looked at this issue in 2011, the paper dollar was only lasting a little bit over three years,"" said John Shumann, an assistant director at the GAO. ""When we looked at this issue again this year, we found that the paper dollar is now lasting almost eight years long.""
Shumann said that's partly because of changes in the way the Federal Reserve processes dollar bills. But it's also a sign that in an increasingly cashless world, paper dollars aren't getting around like they used to.
""They're often showing less signs of wear and tear,"" Shumann said.
As part of its research, the GAO surveyed lots of industries that might have a stake in the paper-versus-coin contest and found that most are not eagerly embracing the switch to $1 coins.
Presidential Dollar Coin Program $1 Billion That Nobody Wants Even the Coin Laundry Association.
""You know, it's right in our name,"" said CEO Brian Wallace, whose group represents some 30,000 self-service laundries around the country.
Despite the name, only a handful of those businesses currently accept $1 coins. Meanwhile, alternative payment options have proliferated.
""You could still pay with a quarter,"" Wallace said. ""But you could also pay with a credit card or add value to a card. Or taking the Starbucks approach of just waving the phone at the washer and it starts.""
Other businesses long associated with coins have also moved on.
""Once upon a time, toll roads, along with transit systems and the post office itself were the largest coinage handlers in the country,"" said Neil Gray, director of government affairs for the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association.
Not anymore. Fewer than 1 in 5 toll-road users pay cash today.
""To the extent possible, we've had entire toll road systems eliminate cash completely,"" Gray said.
Business Sweden's Cashless Experiment: Is It Too Much Too Fast? Even slot machines have largely done away with coin slots.
(One exception is the gumball machine industry, which told the GAO it could offer higher-quality gum and toys if more people carried $1 coins.)
The new GAO report may discourage congressional efforts to phase out the dollar bill. In any case, $1 coins have proved stubbornly unpopular with the public. That's why the Fed has more than a billion of the coins sitting unused in storage."
Arizona GOP Lawmakers Propose New Laws To Remove Some People From Early Voting List,www.npr.org,Bret Jaspers,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169880/arizona-gop-lawmakers-propose-new-laws-to-remove-some-people-from-early-voting-l,"After Democrats surged to new levels of success in Arizona last fall, Republican state lawmakers there have proposed new voting laws that could make casting a ballot there more complicated.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Turnout was way up in the 2018 midterms, and in the southwest, that translated into gains for Democrats. Now Republicans in some southwestern states are pushing bills that change the rules around voting. Critics say these changes are designed to reduce turnout in future elections. From Phoenix, KJZZ's Bret Jaspers reports on how it's playing out in Arizona.
BRET JASPERS, BYLINE: Republicans had full control of Arizona's politics until last fall, then, after Democratic turnout surged, they lost 4 out of 9 statewide races including, a U.S. Senate seat. Now Republicans in the legislature are proposing new voting rules that could make it more complicated to cast a ballot. One change would remove some people from the permanent early voting list.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MICHELLE UGENTI-RITA: It says permanent early voting list. I don't know why everyone keeps ignoring the operative word, which is early.
JASPERS: That's the bill's sponsor, Republican State Senator Michelle Ugenti-Rita. People on the permanent early voting list get ballots mailed to them so that they can mail them back or drop them off on Election Day. Ugenti-Rita wants counties to purge people from that list if they don't vote using an early ballot in two consecutive election cycles.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UGENTI-RITA: We want to make sure that the lists are up to date. That's just good practice. That makes sense on, frankly, any kind of database that you have that you're really communicating with those who want to be communicated with and that are using the service. This is a service. It's a convenience.
JASPERS: Local election officials say they already have ways to maintain clean voting rolls. The Arizona secretary of state's office estimates 200,000 voters currently on the permanent early voting list didn't vote in both 2016 and 2018. But the office also says the bill's language is unclear, making it hard to estimate the impact. Democratic Representative Athena Salman calls it voter suppression to purge the permanent early voting list known as PEVL - or PEEVL (ph).
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ATHENA SALMAN: There is a great debate around whether or not it is PEHVL (ph) or PEEVL.
(LAUGHTER)
SALMAN: But I find it fitting that, if this bill passes, the list will no longer be permanent. And so one might call it EEVL (ph).
JASPERS: Republicans dispute this is an attempt to make voting more difficult. The bill doesn't remove people from the registration rolls, just the mailing list for early ballots. Some local officials say it will create more confusion. Republican lawmakers have proposed other bills this legislative session that have drawn criticism from voting rights groups, including one that bans paying workers for each voter registration form they turn in.
DANIELLE LANG: We are seeing both the good and bad side of the fallout of the 2018 election.
JASPERS: Danielle Lang is an attorney with the Campaign Legal Center, which works with voting rights groups across the country, including in Arizona. She says lawmakers often re-examine voting laws after an election. For example, there's a push from Iowa's Republican governor to make it easier for convicted felons to restore their right to vote after release. That effort is bipartisan, unlike Arizona's bill, which has advanced along party lines.
LANG: All Americans care about election integrity, and yet these issues get framed in very unhelpful partisan ways.
JASPERS: Republicans control the Arizona legislature. The bill to purge the permanent early voting list still has to pass the full House. GOP Governor Doug Ducey's office says it doesn't comment on pending legislation. For NPR News, I'm Bret Jaspers in Phoenix.

NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Mark Hetfield, president of the refugee organization HIAS, about President Trump's comments that America is ""full,"" and how that message is reminiscent of far-right rhetoric in Europe.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Now we're going to dig into the history of a phrase that President Trump has been using a lot lately. During a visit to a U.S. Border Patrol station in California on Friday, he said this.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Can't take you anymore - we can't take you. Our country is full. Our area's full. The sector is full - can't take you anymore. I'm sorry.
SHAPIRO: He doubled down on those remarks Saturday before the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: Can't come in - our country is full. What can you do? We can't handle any more. Our country is full - can't come in. I'm sorry. It's very simple.
(CHEERING)
SHAPIRO: And then yesterday he tweeted, our country is - all caps - FULL. Trump's comments were directed at Central American migrants. In other countries, far-right leaders are using the same phrase to reject people from Syria, North Africa and other parts of the world. Mark Hetfield is president and CEO of HIAS, the Jewish nonprofit organization that helps resettle refugees here in the U.S. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
MARK HETFIELD: Thank you, Ari.
SHAPIRO: That line, our country is full, has a particular resonance for Jews. What echoes do you hear in that phrase?
HETFIELD: Well, we hear echoes dating back to 1921 when the door was slammed shut on people who were fleeing persecution. And we hear echoes from the saint - voyage of the St. Louis, which coincidentally occurred 80 years ago next month when that ship was turned away.
SHAPIRO: For people who aren't familiar with the St. Louis, we're talking about 1939. This was a ship carrying Jewish refugees that was turned back from the United States.
HETFIELD: Yeah, absolutely - to Germany, originally. And then they ended up distributing many of them in other - many of the 937 passengers who were sent back - to other European countries. And over 250 of those perished.
SHAPIRO: We heard participants in the Republican Jewish Coalition cheering President Trump's remarks over the weekend. And President Trump has stressed his support for Israel. It doesn't seem that he was trying to echo rhetoric of the Holocaust, does it?
HETFIELD: Well, I don't want to make comparisons with the rhetoric of the Holocaust. But what I will say is that the entire system of asylum protection and refugee protection in this country and in the world was built on the ashes of the Holocaust to make sure that never again would people be trapped inside of a genocide or trapped inside of a country where they are facing persecution.
And so to hear him make those comments on Shabbat to the Republican Jewish Coalition that asylum is a scam and that our country is being invaded - the same word that the murderer used who went into the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh about people who are coming to this country - I mean, that was deeply offensive to us at HIAS.
SHAPIRO: Your organization's mission is resettling refugees in the United States. So you're not a disinterested observer. Border crossings have nearly doubled over a year ago. Border Patrol caught almost a hundred thousand people entering the U.S. from Mexico last month, the highest number in more than a decade. So setting aside the echoes of the phrase our country is full, do you think there is any point where the number of people trying to come into the U.S. just becomes too great?
HETFIELD: Well, we have not come close to reaching that point. Instead, what's been happening is the machinery that's been developed to decide whether or not these people need protection has been totally broken. This administration - one of the first things that they did was they closed down the only legal route that Central American minors had to get to the United States. So now they're forced to take this route because they are running for their lives. The president wanted to build a wall for $5 billion. The budget of the immigration court system is less than a tenth of that per year.
SHAPIRO: OK.
HETFIELD: But he's not investing in that.
SHAPIRO: Mark Hetfield is president of HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit that resettles refugees in the United States. Thanks so much.

What's Next For Immigration As Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen Leaves,www.npr.org,John Burnett,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169809/what-s-next-after-nielsen,"President Trump has signaled he'll take a tougher approach to immigration after the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and as migrant families continue to cross the border.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
A number of top officials at the Department of Homeland Security are on their way out. That includes the top official - Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Today, outside her home in Virginia, she said she was working to ensure a smooth transition.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN: I share the president's goal of securing the border. I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border.
CHANG: DHS has been unable to stop a surge of migrant families from crossing the southern border. That has clearly frustrated President Trump, and he's signaled that he now wants to take an even tougher approach. NPR's John Burnett is on the line with us from Austin to talk about what that tougher approach might look like. Hey, John.
JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Hello, Ailsa.
CHANG: So, first, do we even know why Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen left? I mean, how much of a surprise was her departure?
BURNETT: Well, it was pretty abrupt. And she hasn't said exactly what her reasons for leaving were. In her resignation letter, there were definitely hints at her frustration. She said, I hope the next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America's borders.
Her defenders say she was really in an impossible situation. There is only so much federal agents can do to prevent people from crossing the border to ask for asylum unless Congress changes some laws. But the president's been growing really impatient with her for months.
CHANG: I mean, speaking of the courts, as she mentioned in that quote you just read, later today there was some news out of a federal court in California about the administration's policy of sending some asylum-seekers to Mexico to wait for their court dates.
BURNETT: That's right. One of her signature efforts to discourage asylum-seekers was this program that forces them to wait in Mexico while their cases work through U.S. immigration courts. DHS called it migrant protection protocols.
San Francisco Judge Richard Seeborg slapped a preliminary injunction on DHS and said you can no longer send immigrants back to Mexico. He said his order would take effect on Friday and that the 11 migrant plaintiffs should be allowed into the U.S. The policy was sort of in an experimental phase. It began at the San Diego border crossing in January. And it was recently expanded to Calexico and El Paso.
The ACLU, which argued the case, had this reaction - quote, ""try as it may, the Trump administration cannot simply ignore our laws in order to accomplish its goal of preventing people from seeking asylum in the United States."" And there's been no response yet from DHS.
But, Ailsa, it just shows you how difficult that Nielsen's tenure has been. So many Trump immigration initiatives have been blocked by federal courts.
CHANG: I mean, I can imagine it must be doubly frustrating, all these federal court decisions against the administration, and now, the historic number of border crossings by families and unaccompanied children.
BURNETT: Exactly. Later this week, the Border Patrol expects to report that there were more than 100,000 apprehensions in March alone. Immigration officials have just lately been gloomy about how their system is overwhelmed, talking about reaching the breaking point. DHS has had to pull agents from all across the system to pitch in at the border, processing all these immigrant families. And so immigration hardliners think that DHS is sort of waving a white flag.
CHANG: So if the administration wants to have more bolder actions, what kind of bold actions do we expect them to take?
BURNETT: Well, DHS has been in sort of a bunker mode and isn't talking about it. But Trump clearly wants an aggressive new team over immigration. I spoke with several immigration conservatives who were influential with the administration today, and they see three aggressive policy options on the table.
First, change the rules so that ICE can detain families together indefinitely until their asylum cases are adjudicated and they can be deported - and build tent camps to hold them on the border because there's not nearly enough room in ICE detention centers. And if they go that course, it will lead - it would lead to yet another big battle in federal court. We just saw this one come out in San Francisco.
Second, flood the zone with asylum officers, immigration judges and ICE attorneys, put migrants on what they call the rocket docket - turn them around and send them home. Of course, again, immigration lawyers are extremely leery, saying it will violate an asylum-seeker's due process.
And third, some hardliners are saying a version of family separation remains under consideration at the White House. So overall, the endgame is deterrence - convince Central Americans it's just no longer a good idea to cross the border.
CHANG: I'm struck that you mentioned family separation. They already tried family separation, and they gave up on it. So what would be different about it this time?
BURNETT: Well, back in October, DHS first floated this idea. And they've tried to rebrand it. A family that crosses the border unlawfully would be given a binary choice. They could decide if they want to give their child up, let the government put them in a youth shelter, or they could agree to be detained indefinitely together, possibly in a tent city. But this is really sort of a nuclear option. And it's so controversial, even among Trump boosters. They're not sure they want the administration to go there.
CHANG: That's NPR's John Burnett in Austin. Thanks, John.

Mary Laura Philpott Discusses Her New Memoir 'I Miss You When I Blink' : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169887/mary-laura-philpott-discusses-her-new-memoir-i-miss-you-when-i-blink,"NPR's Audie Cornish speaks to author Mary Laura Philpott about her new book of essays I Miss You When I Blink.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
There's a roadmap for a certain kind of memoir. A woman realizes her life isn't working, so she blows it up and hits the road. Mary Laura Philpott's new memoir does not follow that path.
MARY LAURA PHILPOTT: I have not bought a Corvette. I have not sold all my belongings and put on a backpack and traveled the world. I did not have 20 extremely smooth years of adulthood and then just blow it all up. I've had what I feel like are more like a series of small identity crises every few years where I have to recalibrate a little bit.
SHAPIRO: The book is called ""I Miss You When I Blink,"" and it's about how to stay in your life, how to do the hard work that it takes to get to OK, even if your relentless perfectionism tends to get in the way. My co-host Audie Cornish spoke with Mary Laura Philpott earlier.
AUDIE CORNISH, BYLINE: So let's talk about some of the stories here because they are essays.
PHILPOTT: Yes.
CORNISH: But they do build. There is a kind of arc.
PHILPOTT: Yeah.
CORNISH: And I want to talk about one called ""The Perfect Murder Weapon,"" which is not a title I expected to read.
(LAUGHTER)
CORNISH: But this is about, I think, a humorous idea of the desire to plan in the perfect murder or, essentially, is it about that or about critiquing crimes that have already happened?
PHILPOTT: It's about the need to plan the perfect everything. It's about going through life as a perfectionist, self-aware enough to know that I'm a perfectionist but unable to resist the need to get every little thing right, including things that are none of my business. Like when I watch a crime show on television, staying awake all night and rethinking the crime and how I would have done it better and gotten away with it.
CORNISH: I want you to read a passage from this essay. It's on page 21.
PHILPOTT: OK.
CORNISH: And it begins, I'm making it sound like...
PHILPOTT: Yes.
(Reading) I'm making it sound like being this way is fun, like it's a hilarious quirk. But to be clear, it's also miserable. I hate that I can't relax. I wish I didn't have a to-do list in my peripheral vision at all times. It's an exhausting way to live, but try as I might, I can't turn it off. My brain seeks tasks to check off, I's to dot and T's to cross, not to mention X's to slash, E's to loop and Z's to zag, the way a sort-of-but-not-really reformed smoker sucks in a deep lung full of nicotine when walking past a crowd of smokers outside a bar. Like any high-functioning addict, I've learned to sneak a hit wherever I can. When the pediatrician gives me my kids' growth charts, I look for the percentages first. When the water meter guy handed me a report with our latest meter reading, I scanned it for a score and asked, is this good? I can sustain a buzz for hours after anyone tells me that something I've done was the best, even if it's just a colleague at the bookstore where I work saying, hey, Mary Laura, you're the best at changing the toilet paper roll in the employee bathroom. Bam - better than a shot of tequila.
CORNISH: So this sounds exhausting.
PHILPOTT: Indeed.
CORNISH: How do you short-circuit these tendencies?
PHILPOTT: Oh, gosh. I don't know that I've ever really mastered short-circuiting these tendencies. I try to just...
CORNISH: Wait. Do you want to? I should ask that.
PHILPOTT: Well, so yes and no. I mean, I - one of the things that I work through in this book is coming to the understanding that perfectionism and a desire to do things right has led to some really great things in my life. It has also led to a lot of exhaustion and sometimes even depression.
So I feel like the best thing I can do is just be aware of it and maybe catch myself sometimes when I'm spending that effort on things that aren't worth spending it on.
CORNISH: I hope you don't mind me saying this, but there are some aspects of the book that feel like you're, like, the chipper PTA mom that usually in movies is a villain or a bad guy because they're, like, doing everything right.
PHILPOTT: Right. Right.
CORNISH: And then, like, the bad mom strolls in with Converse sneakers. And it's like, I don't care. Anyway, but you're the villain in that story (laughter).
PHILPOTT: I love it. I'd rather be the villain.
CORNISH: But were you nervous about, you know, the idea of, like, privilege - people reading this and being like, this woman is having a severe case of first-world problems.
PHILPOTT: Oh, absolutely, and not just in writing the book, in my life, when I would have thoughts about - I don't feel happy right now. I would then immediately feel guilt at not feeling happy. And I would look at my life and go, I have everything to be happy about. I have a roof over my head. I have enough money for groceries. Everyone in my immediate family is alive and well.
I don't deserve to get to think about problems. And not letting yourself think about a problem doesn't make the problem go away. It just buries it deeper so that it's more of an explosion when it comes to the surface.
CORNISH: A lot of this book also talks about how you maintain an identity or how one maintains an identity outside of being a partner, outside of getting a parent.
PHILPOTT: Yes.
CORNISH: This is a question, obviously, that women have talked about for a very long time. Which brings me to chicken salad because...
PHILPOTT: (Laughter).
CORNISH: There is - let's just call - I'll call it a chicken salad incident in an essay called ""Sports Radio.""
PHILPOTT: (Laughter) Yes.
CORNISH: Set up the story for us.
PHILPOTT: OK. So the essay is called ""Sports Radio"" because I begin by saying, one thing I have never understood is the fascination with sports. I just don't get it, and I feel left out. And then I sort of make the tie over to a memory that I have of a dinner party, and it was all women. And I was sitting at this dining room table. And somebody starts a conversation about what we were eating, which was chicken salad.
And the conversation went on and on. I swear it must have been 19 minutes, down to this minutia of, well, do you put grapes in it? And do you slice the grapes? And do you boil the chicken or do you bake it? And I sat there just seething, having the same feeling that I feel when I listen to sports radio.
Like, we're out for the night. Why aren't we talking about bigger, more interesting things? And I thought, why am I so angry? And if everyone else is excited about chicken salad and I'm not, then something must be wrong with me.
CORNISH: I'm going to put in a vote for you're normal and chicken salad's not that interesting.
PHILPOTT: Thank you. But one of the things I didn't want to feel, but I was feeling in that moment, was - are all of these women talking about chicken salad like it's the most important thing in the world because they've had kids and now they're obsessed with domestic things? And I didn't want to think that because I don't believe that. But I was - that thought was entering my mind, and it was really bothering me.
CORNISH: I don't know if you've had any friends read the book yet, but have you had someone say, yo, MLP, I don't care about chicken salad. I just was at the party talking like everyone else.
PHILPOTT: You know what?
CORNISH: Why didn't you say something?
PHILPOTT: You know what? I've had both. I've had friends reach out and say, thank you so much for writing that chicken salad story. I've been stuck in so many chicken salad conversations that I couldn't wait to get out of.
And then I also had a friend say, you know what, it sort of hurts my feelings that thing you wrote about the chicken salad because when I was in the chicken salad years, I was just trying to survive that phase of life. And I was interested in those things because that's what was right in front of me at that time.
CORNISH: You know, at the end of the day, so much of - so many of the essays kind of spoke to the idea of reinvention.
PHILPOTT: Yes.
CORNISH: Not just the idea of saying, I think something needs to change, but then, like, the really hard work of making yourself do that.
PHILPOTT: Yes.
CORNISH: What do you want people to take away from watching you go through this process?
PHILPOTT: I guess if you take away anything, it's that you can screw up and try again and that reinvention can be something that happens in small, repeated ways versus one huge way. If the only reinvention stories you've read are the really big blow-up-your-life kind, then reinvention can seem really daunting. But there are other ways to do it, and there are different times to do it. You don't have to wait till your 40th birthday and then blow up your life.
CORNISH: Mary Laura Philpott. Her new book of essays is called ""I Miss You When I Blink."" Thank you so much for speaking with us.
PHILPOTT: Thank you for having me.

Cornell Professor Ifeoma Ajunwa Discusses Artificial Intelligence Used In Hiring : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169802/cornell-professor-ifeoma-ajunwa-discusses-artificial-intelligence-used-in-hiring,"NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with sociologist and legal scholar Ifeoma Ajunwa about artificial intelligence meant to take bias out of the hiring process.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
All right. Let's take a couple minutes now to examine some of the questions you might have that this Swedish hiring robot poses. Ifeoma Ajunwa of Cornell University has studied the use of artificial intelligence in the hiring process here in the U.S. Welcome.
IFEOMA AJUNWA: Thank you very much for having me.
CHANG: Is it possible for AI to completely eliminate human bias in the hiring process?
AJUNWA: I would say no because you still have to remember that AI isn't fully automated. What we call AI are really machine learning algorithms. And so the people who are creating them do have to be conscious of the ways that human bias could still be encoded in those algorithms. And they would have to make really conscious decisions to eliminate those bias to begin with.
CHANG: So we just heard about this, quote, unquote, ""unbiased"" social robot that's going to be used in job interviews in Sweden. Is there anything remotely similar to that being used now here in the U.S.?
AJUNWA: Certainly, yes. There are many hiring algorithms that are now in use in the United States. My co-author and I conducted an informal survey of the top 20 Fortune 500 companies, which are mostly retail companies. And many of those companies require candidates to submit their resumes online, where ostensibly the resume will then pass through some hiring algorithms.
And before you think, oh, this is just, you know, relegated to the blue collar market or just the hourly workforce, also, white-shoe companies like Goldman Sachs have also moved to automated hiring. So starting in 2016, Goldman Sachs moved to video interviews, for example, to interview its entering class of summer associates.
CHANG: Well, what about legal concerns with using AI for hiring? I mean, would someone even have grounds to sue for, say, discrimination if they didn't get a job and the hiring decision was made by an algorithm?
AJUNWA: So that's where it gets more complicated - right? - because a job applicant could suspect that the reason they were refused a job was based on characteristics such as race or gender, and this is certainly prohibited by law. But the problem is how to prove this. So the law requires that you prove either intent to discriminate or you show a pattern of discrimination. Automated hiring platforms actually make it much harder to do either of those.
And a lot of times, the algorithms that are part of the hiring system, they are considered proprietary, meaning that they're a trade secret. So you may not actually be able to be privy to exactly how the algorithms were programmed and also to exactly what attributes were considered. So that actually makes it quite difficult for a job applicant.
CHANG: Ifeoma Ajunwa teaches employment and labor law at Cornell University. Thank you so much for joining us today.
AJUNWA: Thank you so much.

How Venezuela's Currency Became So Worthless,www.npr.org,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169832/how-venezuelas-currency-became-so-worthless,"How Venezuela's Currency Became So Worthless How Venezuela's Currency Became So Worthless Embed Embed
Migrants fleeing Venezuela sell art made from nearly worthless Venezuelan currency. NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Northwestern University's Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez about what happened to the currency.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Here's one vivid illustration of how much trouble Venezuela's economy is in. I was recently in the city of Cucuta on Colombia's border with Venezuela, and I met a man creating paper sculptures for sale by the side of the road. Jorge Cordero is 19 years old. He weaves and braids paper into swans, purses, owls, trucks. And all of the paper is Venezuelan currency - bolivars.
JORGE CORDERO: (Through translator) The bill itself isn't worth anything anymore. It doesn't have any value. People will throw it away, they'll tear it up. And that's why I started using the bills to make bags and other things.
SHAPIRO: How much money do you get for selling a small purse like this? How much do you charge?
CORDERO: (Through interpreter) Well, the small one is 30, 40, 50,000 thousand Colombian pesos - so $10, $15. But you're not paying for the cash. You're paying for the work.
SHAPIRO: When you were a child, this was worth a lot of money. How does it feel today to see how worthless it is?
CORDERO: (Through interpreter) I never imagined working with money. I used to make these things out of magazines or candy wrappers. Back in the day, this stack of cash would be a ton of money. You could buy food, give some extra to your girlfriend. Now it's worthless.
SHAPIRO: To explain how Venezuela's currency became so worthless, I called up Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez at Northwestern University. He studies the economies of Latin America. He told me Venezuela built its entire economy on oil, and it boomed for decades after World War II. When Lansberg-Rodriguez was a kid in the '90s, going back and forth between the U.S. and Venezuela, inflation had started to creep up, but it was nowhere near what it is today.
DANIEL LANSBERG-RODRIGUEZ: It has sort of gone from kind of a joke, to a cautionary tale, to a Shakespearean tragedy.
SHAPIRO: The story of Venezuela's economic collapse is long and complicated. And so if you'll indulge me grossly oversimplifying things...
LANSBERG-RODRIGUEZ: Sure.
SHAPIRO: ...Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's last leader, built the economy on oil and imported everything from clothing to food. Then, in 2013, Nicolas Maduro replaces Chavez. And the next year, oil prices crater. What does that mean for Venezuela?
LANSBERG-RODRIGUEZ: Venezuela was already in recession. Venezuela was already - had oil production that was falling and declining very quickly. So there were already a lot of problems. At the same time, a lot of other petro states - Kuwait, Brazil even managed to save a great deal of money because there is an understanding that oil prices go up and they go down. Venezuela used that period to sort of project a lot more influence abroad. They were subsidizing other economies, and that left very little money in the till for when oil prices actually dropped.
SHAPIRO: That explains why the economy would tank and become weak, but it doesn't necessarily explain why the currency would become worthless. So what created the hyperinflation?
LANSBERG-RODRIGUEZ: So hyperinflation basically was created by two factors. The first was, since there was very little money coming in from oil rents - because oil had suddenly become very cheap - and the government didn't feel it was strong enough to actually make fiscal reforms, which tend to be unpopular, you have a situation where the government is essentially running the printing presses full time and using that to pay off any sort of domestic debt.
SHAPIRO: So you print money like crazy, and the money becomes more or less worthless.
LANSBERG-RODRIGUEZ: Exactly - because of supply and demand, essentially. You have a certain number of goods in the country, which are generally imported because Venezuela produces very little domestically other than oil. And that creates a situation where your money supply is growing, growing, growing. Anything that's not money supply is remaining relatively stable. So the amount of money it takes to actually procure anything ends up going up.
SHAPIRO: That's one aspect of it, but then there's also a psychological component. Explain what role that plays.
LANSBERG-RODRIGUEZ: When people start noticing this, especially people who had already lived with high inflation, people start hedging against that very quickly. And in Venezuela, that's what's essentially created this perfect storm. People treat the bolivar, and have for some time, as essentially an ice cube that you take out of the fridge. And you better have something to do with this ice cube because it's melting the moment it's out of the fridge.
In Venezuela, when people are paid every 15 and every 30 of the month, that's the ice cube game. They have to try and find out, what am I going to do with this paycheck in bolivars that's going to make that value last a lot longer than the coin that I think is already worthless and is going to be more worthless tomorrow than it is today.
SHAPIRO: Lansberg-Rodriguez told me breaking out of that psychological trap is exactly what Venezuela must do to get out of this economic death spiral.
LANSBERG-RODRIGUEZ: The most key component to getting out of a hyper-inflationary cycle, to breaking it, is essentially to win the psychological game. It's not about stopping the presses at this point. It's about convincing Venezuelans - and to some extent, international markets - that the bolivar tomorrow is going to be worth roughly the same as the bolivar today. And with this government, which has very little credibility, you know, towards any semblance of fiscal or economic reform, the chances that anything could realistically change while Maduro is in charge are essentially nil.
So this government right now is not in a position where it could credibly try and tack and say, we're going to make a bunch of long overdue economic reforms. We're going to fix this. Give us the benefit of the doubt. It's sort of gone beyond that. And the sanctions raise the stakes on foreign governments to give Venezuela the benefit of the doubt absent very marquee credible change.
SHAPIRO: That was Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez. He teaches at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management and consults on Latin American risk at the Greenmantle firm. Copyright © 2019 NPR.

Needle Exchanges Are Part Of HHS Sec. Alex Azar's Push To End HIV In The U.S. : Shots - Health News,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/08/711020181/how-trumps-hhs-reconciles-medicaid-cuts-with-stopping-the-spread-of-hiv,"Enlarge this image HHS Secretary Alex Azar at a White House roundtable discussion of health care prices in January. Azar tells NPR his office is now in ""active negotiations and discussion"" with drugmakers on how to make HIV prevention medicines more available and ""cost-effective."" Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images HHS Secretary Alex Azar at a White House roundtable discussion of health care prices in January. Azar tells NPR his office is now in ""active negotiations and discussion"" with drugmakers on how to make HIV prevention medicines more available and ""cost-effective.""
Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images In his State of the Union address this year, President Trump announced an initiative ""to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.""
The man who pitched the president on this idea is Alex Azar, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.
""We have the data that tells us where we have to focus, we have the tools, we have the leadership — this is an historic opportunity,"" Azar told NPR's Ari Shapiro Monday. ""I told the president about this, and he immediately grabbed onto this and saw the potential to alleviate suffering for hundreds of thousands of individuals in this country and is deeply passionate about making that happen.""
Trump's push to end HIV in the U.S. has inspired a mix of enthusiasm and skepticism from public health officials and patient advocates. Enthusiasm, because the plan seems to be rooted in data and is led by officials who have strong credentials in regards to HIV/AIDS. Skepticism, because of the administration's history of rolling back protections for LGBTQ people, many of whom the program will need to reach to be successful.
Shots - Health News To Halt HIV, Advocates Push For PrEP Outreach To Black Women For instance, transgender people are three times more likely to contract HIV than the national average, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Trump has banned transgender people from serving in the military and undone rules that allow transgender students access to bathrooms that fit their gender presentation.
Azar himself has strong Republican credentials — as a young man, he clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia. And yet he's now touring the country promoting this plan to end HIV, which includes supporting needle exchange programs to reduce HIV infection among intravenous drug users.
""Syringe services programs aren't necessarily the first thing that comes to mind when you think about a Republican health secretary,"" Azar acknowledged at an HIV conference last month. ""But we're in a battle between sickness and health — between life and death.""
This interview has been edited for clarity and length.
This morning you toured facilities in East Boston, a neighborhood in one of 48 counties targeted in Trump's plan. What did you learn there?
I was able to be at the East Boston Neighborhood Health Center and they have a remarkable program called Project Shine. What I was able to do is meet with the entire team that provides this type of holistic approach. It is very much what we're going to try to do in the most impacted areas.
You find the individuals who may have HIV — get them diagnosed. Get those who are diagnosed on the HIV antiretroviral treatment — so that they have an undetectable viral load and can't spread the disease to others, as well as live a long healthy life themselves. Get those who are most at risk of contracting HIV on a medicine called PrEP so that they dramatically reduce their chance of getting HIV. And then, finally, respond when you have clusters of outbreaks. So, just getting to see the the holistic approach there was extremely helpful for me.
Shots - Health News Ending HIV In Mississippi Means Cutting Through Racism, Poverty And Homophobia Given that Medicaid is the single largest payer for medical care for people with HIV, do Republican efforts to block Medicaid expansion in high-infection states like Mississippi and Alabama undermine your efforts to get more people treatment?
The program that we have is based on the assumption that Medicaid remains as it is. .... And even were we to change Medicaid, along the lines of what the president has proposed in the budget ...
Meaning the major reductions to Medicaid that are in the president's budget?
Well, there are there are some reductions. But what it would do is actually give states tremendous flexibility. One of the challenges in the Affordable Care Act was that it prejudiced the Medicaid system very much in favor of able-bodied adults, away from the more traditional Medicaid populations of the aged, the disabled, pregnant women and children.
What we would do is restore a lot of flexibility of the states so that they could put those resources really where they're needed. We would expect that those suffering from HIV/AIDS infection would be in the core demographic of people that you would want to make sure were covered. What we will do here, by stopping the epidemic of HIV, is have a dramatic reduction in cost for the Medicaid and Medicare programs in the future.
So one big part of your plan is expanding access to PrEP, the HIV prevention drug. Without insurance it can cost around $1,600 a month in the U.S. A generic version available overseas costs roughly $6 a month. AIDS activists say your department could 'march in' and break the patent that Gilead holds in order to make a generic version available to Americans. Is your agency going to pursue that?
I don't know what you're saying by breaking the patent. There's no such thing as a legal right to break patents in the United States ...
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has a patent for PrEP, which Gilead disputes ...
Shots - Health News PrEP Campaign Aims To Block HIV Infection And Save Lives In D.C. Well, that's very different than breaking a patent. That would be asserting patent rights held by the CDC. So the CDC has a patent on the product and Gilead has a patent on the product. We are actually in active negotiations and discussion with Gilead right now on how we can make PrEP more available and more cost effective for individuals as part of this ending the HIV epidemic program.
I recently went to Jackson, Miss., which has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in the country. I talked to Shawn Esco, a black gay man, who told me that stigma, homophobia, and racism prevent people from seeking care, and he has very little hope. What would you say to him?
That is exactly what the president and I want to solve. I want to give him that hope. So many of the infections are happening in areas of our country where there's intense stigma against individuals — males who have sex with men; the African-American community, Latino community, American Indian, Alaska Native communities. What's really made this is a historic opportunity right now is we have data that show us that 50 percent of new infections are happening in 48 counties as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and so we can focus those efforts.
We want to learn from people on the ground, as I did this morning here in East Boston. How do we reduce stigma? How do we provide a holistic approach for Shawn and others? We can get them diagnosed and get them on treatment in ways that they find acceptable — or, as one of the individuals said to me this morning, meet people where they are."

Spencer Platt/Getty Images A bill introduced in the Oklahoma Legislature has some folks scratching their heads, as it prohibits ""the manufacture or sale of food or products which use aborted human fetuses.""
Since the bill was introduced late last week by State Sen. Ralph Shortey, a Republican from Oklahoma City, corners of the Internet have been buzzing with the news, as people try to figure out two things: 1) is this real; and 2) is there any reason the bill might be needed?
News of the bill was first reported by the AP and The Daily O'Collegian , a student newspaper at Oklahoma State University. It sparked a lively debate in the O'Collegian's readers' comments section, which is connected to Facebook.
The AP and the O'Collegian say that Shortey didn't respond to calls for comment. Two calls from NPR to the senator's office went to voicemail and were not returned. But Tulsa radio station KRMG managed to get in touch with him to ask about the legislation, Senate Bill 1418 .
The senator says that his research shows there are companies in the food industry that have used human stem cells to help them research and develop products, including artificial flavorings.
""I don't know if it is happening in Oklahoma, it may be, it may not be. What I am saying is that if it does happen then we are not going to allow it to manufacture here,"" Shortey tells KRMG's Nicole Burgin .
To that end, his proposed statute reads, ""No person or entity shall manufacture or knowingly sell food or any other product intended for human consumption which contains aborted human fetuses in the ingredients or which used aborted human fetuses in the research or development of any of the ingredients.""
My own research suggests that Shortey may have noticed a boycott directed at PepsiCo, which since 2010 has worked with flavor research firm Senomyx to develop sweeteners and other flavorings.
Based in San Diego, Senomyx has been accused of using proteins derived from human embryonic kidney cells in its research, which has been used by many large food companies. An article in the Miami New Times summarizes those claims , notes the company's denial of them — and also notes that in 2003, the company filed a patent for ""recombinant methods for expressing a functional sweet taste receptor.""
That patent, for what is essentially an automated taste test, was granted in 2008. It mentions HEK 293 , or Human Embryonic Kidney 293, a widely available cell line that was originally cultured in the early 1970s from a human embryo in the Netherlands.
So, it seems that Sen. Shortey's bill mostly targets the potential use of stem cells in food research. But in the past decade, several attempts have been made to use animal stem cells to produce food. For instance, NASA has tinkered with using pigs' stem cells to grow ""lab meat,"" according to a Popular Mechanics article from 2009.
The article continues, ""Today, scientists funded by companies such as Stegeman, a Dutch sausage giant, are fine-tuning the process. It takes just two weeks to turn pig stem cells, or myoblasts, into muscle fibers.""
And the group New Harvest has long been involved in the search for ""meat alternatives,"" in the form of ""plant-based meat analogs and cultured meat,"" according to its site.
Shortey's bill was among hundreds submitted just before the state's Thursday deadline, as Oklahoma legislators vied to get their bills entered for discussion in the upcoming session, which runs from Feb. 6 into late May.

Hurricane Harvey caused more than $125 billion in damages, with over 150,000 flooded homes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The only other storm to cause that much damage to a single U.S. city was Hurricane Katrina.
The problem for many Houstonians stuck in recovery purgatory isn't lack of available funds, however. It's the mountains of paperwork that keep them from accessing those funds.
Only a fraction of the billions of dollars set aside for 2017's major hurricanes has been tapped, according to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).
That same report shows that Texas underspent — using about $18 million of $5 billion set aside for administration and planning purposes.
The money hasn't been spent because of red tape and bureaucratic sluggishness, according to the GAO.
Alice Torres says she's seen this stagnation firsthand while attending city council meetings. She watched as relief aid got tied up in political maneuvering. She says she's lost faith in the system. And she's definitely not the only one. Facebook"

After walking through a list of issues from foreign threats to student loan debt to gun violence, he added, ""None of that is going to change until we get a leader who is willing to go big on thee issues we take on, be bold in the solutions we offer and do good in the way that we govern.

He's hosting a town hall Tuesday on the subject at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Fla., only 13 miles from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., the scene of the 2018 massacre that killed 17 people. The BB&T Center, where the Florida Panthers ice hockey team plays, is an arena with capacity seating of more than 20,000.
Politics Which Democrats Are Running In 2020 — And Which Still Might That Parkland shooting has led to mass demonstrations and activism from not just survivors of the shooting but many other young people across the country. In fact, helping to organize the town hall was Cameron Kasky, a Parkland survivor, who was Swalwell's guest for the State of the Union address.
Swalwell has also taken on the National Rifle Association, proposing an assault-weapons ban. The NRA put Swalwell on the cover of its January magazine, which Swalwell embraced, saying he is ""living in the NRA's head.""

Swalwell, who was born in Iowa but grew up in California, is less known than some other Democrats running for president. But he has been a fixture on cable news during the Mueller probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and alleged collusion with the Trump campaign.
Politics Pete Buttigieg Explains His Agenda For Black Voters Swalwell is used to being the underdog. He won his seat to Congress in 2012 when he was only 31. The former deputy district attorney from the East Bay are of California, near San Francisco, ousted a 40-year incumbent Democrat, Pete Stark.
That rankled the party establishment, but he quickly made nice with Pelosi, a fellow Bay Area congresswoman – and powerful leader on Capitol Hill.
Instead of making an enemy of Swalwell, Pelosi, who has faced criticism that the party needs younger leadership, embraced him. Swalwell became known as the "" Snapchat king of Congress .""

Trump Administration Blocks Major League Baseball Deal For Cuban Players,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711234347/trump-administration-kills-baseball-deal-with-cuba,"The Trump administration has canceled a deal between Major League Baseball and the Cuban Baseball Federation that would have allowed Cuban players to join professional teams in the U.S. and Canada.
Under the four-month-old agreement, a major league club seeking to sign certain Cuban players would have to pay a release fee – 25 percent over the player's signing bonus – to the Federation. The player would also have to pay Cuban income taxes on foreign earnings.
The deal, which was initially negotiated under President Barack Obama, met with immediate opposition from the Trump administration.

Morry Gash/AP Morry Gash/AP Jose Abreu of the Chicago White Sox, seen in 2017, was one of the Cuban players who survived a risky, secret journey to the U.S. to play baseball.
Morry Gash/AP It was designed to end the often dangerous pattern of ambitious Cuban stars seeking to join the major leagues by defecting and arranging to smuggle themselves out of Cuba with the aid of human traffickers. Under the agreement, Cuban players may return to the island during the off-season, unlike those who defect.
A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said in a briefing that the agreement itself was a form of ""human trafficking"" by the Cuban government and that the Cuban Baseball Federation is a subsidiary of the Cuban government.
""We look forward to the day that Cuban baseball players can fully contract with Major League Baseball like players from every other country in the world and not as pawns of the Cuban dictatorship,"" the official told reporters .
Major League Baseball defended the plan.
""We stand by the goal of the agreement, which is to end the human trafficking of baseball players from Cuba,"" said league vice president Michael Teevan, in a emailed statement.
The administration blocked the baseball deal just a few days after the Cuban federation released the names of 34 players eligible to sign with MLB teams. Cuban players older than 25 years old and with six years of experience were eligible for the arrangement. Younger players were required to get the Cuban Baseball Federation's blessing to play for MLB teams.
""The agreement with #MLB seeks to stop the trafficking of human beings, encourage cooperation and raise the level of baseball,"" the Cuban Baseball Federation said in a message on Twitter as Quote: d by Reuters. ""Any contrary idea is false news. Attacks with political motivation against the agreement achieved harm the athletes, their families and the fans.""
Some Florida lawmakers had opposed the baseball agreement for being an accommodation with the Cuban government. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, in December, called the deal ""both illegal and immoral.""
Among the Cuban-born players who have defected and struck it rich signing with MLB clubs in recent years are Jose Abreu of the Chicago White Sox, Yoenis Cespedes of the New York Mets and Yasiel Puig of the Cincinnati Reds."

NPR's Audie Cornish speaks with Shannon O'Neil, of the Council on Foreign Relations, about U.S. efforts to solve the root causes of migration in Central American countries.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
Let's take a look at what the U.S. is doing about the reasons why so many Central Americans are coming to the U.S. and asking for asylum, about the poverty and violence in their home countries. Joining us is Shannon O'Neil. She's an expert on Latin America with the Council on Foreign Relations. Welcome to the program.
SHANNON O'NEIL: Thanks for having me.
CORNISH: So we've heard a lot now about what the Trump administration does once migrants make it to the border. Can you talk about what the administration has been doing to try and address some of those, as we said, push factors of poverty or violence in countries in Central America - El Salvador, Guatemala?
O'NEIL: So since 2015, which was the last surge of people coming up from Central America, Congress has sent in a bipartisan agreement somewhere in the range of $750 million a year to Central America to try to deal with these root causes. So this goes into all sorts of programs, things to address youth at risk, after-school programs and the like. It goes to programs to create jobs in the region. It goes to programs to strengthen police or the court system to try to bring safety to the streets there to change the factors that are driving all of these individuals and these families north to the U.S. border.
CORNISH: But did it make a dent? I mean, here we are again asking the same question.
O'NEIL: Here we are again. And in part, these are huge problems to grapple with. And $750 million is not going to change things overnight in countries that are plagued with some of the world's highest violence rates and homicide rates, where you see abject poverty, where you're seeing real consequences of climate change taking away basic crops - coffee and the like - through a years-long drought now. So there's a lot of issues here that will take time to change but also take more money than the U.S. has been providing.
CORNISH: The other issue is given the level of corruption or government mismanagement, are there effective partners on the ground? I mean, is there a way for the U.S. or any other country in the region to effectively spend money to help people in these countries who might otherwise become migrants?
O'NEIL: This is a challenge as well. We have seen on the ground in some of these countries small organizations, NGOs and civil society organizations that have made the difference in the lives of individuals, of families, of particular blocks or particular neighborhoods. But looking for systematic change on a national level - that has to involve the governments in these countries in Guatemala, in El Salvador, in Honduras. And many of these governments, as you say, have been plagued by corruption and worse in several - in the last several years.
CORNISH: Now, Mexico has put forth a possible solution dubbed a kind of Marshall Plan for Central America. And it would require major U.S. investment in the region, right? And the idea is to create jobs in Central America and Mexico so that people won't want to leave home. Is there - is that a solution that has some buy-in?
O'NEIL: So Mexico has talked about sending billions of dollars to Central America, to upping what the United States has been doing for the last few years. But, one, Mexico would need the United States to join in in that. And, two, Mexico and the new president there, Lopez Obrador - he has made lots of promises to Mexicans themselves to increase jobs in Mexico, to improve the economy there, to provide benefits to old people, to young people, to students, to all sorts of people that will cost a lot of money. And so when he is forced to choose between his own citizens and Central Americans and particularly Central Americans in Central America, I think it will come down to funding Mexicans.
CORNISH: Is the administration - U.S. administration interested in this at all?
O'NEIL: The Trump administration the last couple of years - when they've sent a budget to Congress, they have reduced the spending for Central America for reduce - for these root causes, as such, in these countries. Now, Congress has put the money back in, but this has not been the focus of the Trump administration. Where they have put their focus is on the border and the enforcement on the border. So while we spend less than a billion dollars in Central America to change the things on the ground there, we spend over $20 billion enforcing the border and dealing with the Central Americans when they show up there.
CORNISH: In the meantime, are there any other initiatives that have come up? I mean, is this something that people are looking at more closely?
O'NEIL: Overall I think this is something that will continue to be a huge challenge for the United States and increasingly for Mexico because the Trump administration's policy - this remain in Mexico, to have these citizens of Central America wait in Mexico for perhaps years for the United States to process their asylum cases - we'll just see more problems not just in Central America but all the way along the path.
CORNISH: That Shannon O'Neil, expert on Latin America with the Council on Foreign Relations. Thank you for speaking with us.

U.K. Regulators Propose Broad Social Media Regulations To Counter 'Online Harms',www.npr.org,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711091689/u-k-regulators-propose-broad-social-media-regulations-to-counter-online-harms,"Enlarge this image Facebook, Messenger and Instagram apps are displayed on an iPhone. U.K. regulators are proposing broad new rules on social media platforms to combat online harms. Jenny Kane/AP Jenny Kane/AP Facebook, Messenger and Instagram apps are displayed on an iPhone. U.K. regulators are proposing broad new rules on social media platforms to combat online harms.
Jenny Kane/AP Terrorists groups using the Internet to spread propaganda. Criminal gangs inciting violence over social media. Sexual predators going online to groom children for exploitation.
These are some of the harms the United Kingdom has identified that spread via social media platforms. To counter those harms, the U.K. plans to require social media companies to be much more active in removing and responding to harmful material on their platforms. The sweeping 102-page white paper , released Monday, envisions requirements for everything from ensuring an accurate news environment, to combating hate speech, to stamping out cyberbullying.
The proposal is the latest in a series of increased efforts by governments around the world to respond to harmful content online. Last year Germany imposed fines of up to $60 million if social media companies don't delete illegal content posted to their services. After the massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, Australian lawmakers passed legislation subjecting social media executives to imprisonment if they don't quickly remove violent content. The U.K. proposal goes further than most by proposing the creation of a new regulatory body to monitor a broad array of harms and ensure companies comply.
Business Facebook Has Behaved Like 'Digital Gangsters,' U.K. Parliament Report Says ""I'm deeply concerned that social media firms are still not doing enough to protect users from harmful content,"" Prime Minister Theresa May said . ""So today, we're putting a legal duty of care on these companies to keep users safe. And if they fail to do so, tough punishments will be imposed. The era of social media firms regulating themselves is over.""
The new duty of care has yet to be fleshed out, but U.K. officials offered plenty of suggestions for what they expect a new regulator to include in a code of practice. Officials expect companies to do what they can to ""counter illegal content and activity."" That could include requirements to actively ""scan or monitor content for tightly defined categories of illegal content"" such as or threats to national security, or material that sexually exploits children.

— Home Office (@ukhomeoffice) April 8, 2019 Officials also expect any code of practice to require that social media companies use fact-checking services during elections, promote ""authoritative"" news services, and generally try to counter the echo chamber in which many users are exposed to viewpoints they already agree with.
If companies don't comply with the new rules, they could face ""substantial"" fines — and individual members of the company's senior management could face personal liability. It's a big change from the current system of liability, in which online platforms aren't held responsible for illegal content that users upload, until they become aware of it.
""We cannot allow these harmful behaviours and content to undermine the significant benefits that the digital revolution can offer,"" said Jeremy Wright, the U.K.'s digital secretary, in a statement accompanying the proposal. ""While some companies have taken steps to improve safety on their platforms, progress has been too slow and inconsistent overall. If we surrender our online spaces to those who spread hate, abuse, fear and vitriolic content, then we will all lose.""
Regulators proposed that the new rules apply to companies that ""allow users to share or discover user-generated content or interact with each other online."" The broad language encompasses ""a very wide range of companies of all sizes,"" the report said, ""including social media platforms, file hosting sites, public discussion forums, messaging services and search engines.""
Business With Facebook Ban On White Extremism, International Norms Apply To U.S. Online companies said they supported the idea of ensuring a safer Internet, but noted that they have already poured substantial resources into countering online harms. ""We haven't waited for regulation, we've created new technology, hired experts and specialists, and ensured our policies are fit for the evolving challenges we face online,"" Google public policy manager Claire Lilley told TechCrunch .
TechUK, a consortium of technology companies in the U.K. including Facebook, said in a statement that many of the proposals are too vague. ""The duty of care is a deceptively straightforward sounding concept. However it is still not clearly defined and open to broad interpretation,"" the group said. ""Government will need to clarify the legal meaning and how it expects companies to comply with such a potentially broad obligation which could conflict with other fundamental rights - particularly in relation to private communications on their platforms.""
Berin Szoka, president of the libertarian think tank TechFreedom, cautioned that the proposal ""mandates a sweeping system of self-censorship"" that could cause companies to ""over-censor in order to avoid the wrath of the regulator."" In an e-mail to NPR, Szoka said he worries that such a system could ""legitimize the same kind of system in Russia, China and other countries."" Authoritarian governments around the world ""will all undoubtedly exploit the UK's model to justify their own system of censoring content they deem 'harmful,' "" he said."

Seeborg also wrote that the MPP lacked sufficient safeguards for ensuring that people who want to apply for asylum are not returned ""to places where they face undue risk to their lives or freedom.""
The ruling came in response to a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups on behalf of 11 asylum-seekers from Central America. It argued that requiring the migrants to wait in Mexico violated humanitarian protections offered under U.S. and international law.
""The court strongly rejected the Trump administration's unprecedented and illegal policy of forcing asylum seekers to return to Mexico without hearing their claims,"" said deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, Judy Rabinovitz in a statement. ""Try as it may, the Trump administration cannot simply ignore our laws in order to accomplish its goal of preventing people from seeking asylum in the United States.""
The ruling, even if its implementation is delayed, is a setback for the Trump administration, which says its hard-line immigration policies are an appropriate response to a crisis at the border. The administration had hoped that the asylum protocols, dubbed by some officials as Remain in Mexico , would discourage migrants from seeking refuge in the U.S.
Last week, Nielsen had ordered Customs and Border Protection to ""immediately expand"" enforcement of the Migrant Protection Protocols beyond its roll out at the ports of entry at San Ysidro and Calexico, Calif., and El Paso, Texas. The expansion was to have included the entire 2,000-mile border.
On Sunday, a day before the ruling, Nielsen resigned from her post amid reports that other top immigration officials also will be replaced.
Judge Seeborg gave the government until 5 p.m. ET on Friday to appeal his ruling. The Justice Department did not respond to an email request for comment. "
Needle Exchanges Are Part Of HHS Sec. Alex Azar's Push To End HIV In The U.S. : Shots - Health News,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/08/711020181/how-trumps-hhs-reconciles-medicaid-cuts-with-stopping-the-spread-of-hiv?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image HHS Secretary Alex Azar at a White House roundtable discussion of health care prices in January.

Azar tells NPR his office is now in ""active negotiations and discussion"" with drugmakers on how to make HIV prevention medicines more available and ""cost-effective.""
Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images In his State of the Union address this year, President Trump announced an initiative ""to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.""
The man who pitched the president on this idea is Alex Azar, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.
""We have the data that tells us where we have to focus, we have the tools, we have the leadership — this is an historic opportunity,"" Azar told NPR's Ari Shapiro Monday. ""I told the president about this, and he immediately grabbed onto this and saw the potential to alleviate suffering for hundreds of thousands of individuals in this country and is deeply passionate about making that happen.""
Trump's push to end HIV in the U.S. has inspired a mix of enthusiasm and skepticism from public health officials and patient advocates. Enthusiasm, because the plan seems to be rooted in data and is led by officials who have strong credentials in regards to HIV/AIDS. Skepticism, because of the administration's history of rolling back protections for LGBTQ people, many of whom the program will need to reach to be successful.
Shots - Health News To Halt HIV, Advocates Push For PrEP Outreach To Black Women For instance, transgender people are three times more likely to contract HIV than the national average, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Trump has banned transgender people from serving in the military and undone rules that allow transgender students access to bathrooms that fit their gender presentation.
Azar himself has strong Republican credentials — as a young man, he clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia. And yet he's now touring the country promoting this plan to end HIV, which includes supporting needle exchange programs to reduce HIV infection among intravenous drug users.
""Syringe services programs aren't necessarily the first thing that comes to mind when you think about a Republican health secretary,"" Azar acknowledged at an HIV conference last month. ""But we're in a battle between sickness and health — between life and death.""
This interview has been edited for clarity and length.
This morning you toured facilities in East Boston, a neighborhood in one of 48 counties targeted in Trump's plan. What did you learn there?
I was able to be at the East Boston Neighborhood Health Center and they have a remarkable program called Project Shine. What I was able to do is meet with the entire team that provides this type of holistic approach. It is very much what we're going to try to do in the most impacted areas.
You find the individuals who may have HIV — get them diagnosed. Get those who are diagnosed on the HIV antiretroviral treatment — so that they have an undetectable viral load and can't spread the disease to others, as well as live a long healthy life themselves. Get those who are most at risk of contracting HIV on a medicine called PrEP so that they dramatically reduce their chance of getting HIV. And then, finally, respond when you have clusters of outbreaks. So, just getting to see the the holistic approach there was extremely helpful for me.
Shots - Health News Ending HIV In Mississippi Means Cutting Through Racism, Poverty And Homophobia Given that Medicaid is the single largest payer for medical care for people with HIV, do Republican efforts to block Medicaid expansion in high-infection states like Mississippi and Alabama undermine your efforts to get more people treatment?
The program that we have is based on the assumption that Medicaid remains as it is. .... And even were we to change Medicaid, along the lines of what the president has proposed in the budget ...
Meaning the major reductions to Medicaid that are in the president's budget?
Well, there are there are some reductions. But what it would do is actually give states tremendous flexibility. One of the challenges in the Affordable Care Act was that it prejudiced the Medicaid system very much in favor of able-bodied adults, away from the more traditional Medicaid populations of the aged, the disabled, pregnant women and children.
What we would do is restore a lot of flexibility of the states so that they could put those resources really where they're needed. We would expect that those suffering from HIV/AIDS infection would be in the core demographic of people that you would want to make sure were covered. What we will do here, by stopping the epidemic of HIV, is have a dramatic reduction in cost for the Medicaid and Medicare programs in the future.
So one big part of your plan is expanding access to PrEP, the HIV prevention drug. Without insurance it can cost around $1,600 a month in the U.S. A generic version available overseas costs roughly $6 a month. AIDS activists say your department could 'march in' and break the patent that Gilead holds in order to make a generic version available to Americans. Is your agency going to pursue that?
I don't know what you're saying by breaking the patent. There's no such thing as a legal right to break patents in the United States ...
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has a patent for PrEP, which Gilead disputes ...
Shots - Health News PrEP Campaign Aims To Block HIV Infection And Save Lives In D.C. Well, that's very different than breaking a patent. That would be asserting patent rights held by the CDC. So the CDC has a patent on the product and Gilead has a patent on the product. We are actually in active negotiations and discussion with Gilead right now on how we can make PrEP more available and more cost effective for individuals as part of this ending the HIV epidemic program.
I recently went to Jackson, Miss., which has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in the country. I talked to Shawn Esco, a black gay man, who told me that stigma, homophobia, and racism prevent people from seeking care, and he has very little hope. What would you say to him?
That is exactly what the president and I want to solve. I want to give him that hope. So many of the infections are happening in areas of our country where there's intense stigma against individuals — males who have sex with men; the African-American community, Latino community, American Indian, Alaska Native communities. What's really made this is a historic opportunity right now is we have data that show us that 50 percent of new infections are happening in 48 counties as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and so we can focus those efforts.
We want to learn from people on the ground, as I did this morning here in East Boston. How do we reduce stigma? How do we provide a holistic approach for Shawn and others? We can get them diagnosed and get them on treatment in ways that they find acceptable — or, as one of the individuals said to me this morning, meet people where they are."
GAO Says Replacing Dollar Bills With Coins Could Cost Billions,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711162059/government-watchdog-flips-on-dollar-coin?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image A pile of newly minted one-dollar coins honoring former Thomas Jefferson are seen at the unveiling by the U.S. Mint in Washington, D.C., in 2007.

toggle caption Jim Young/Reuters A pile of newly minted one-dollar coins honoring former Thomas Jefferson are seen at the unveiling by the U.S. Mint in Washington, D.C., in 2007. In a turnaround, congressional analysts are no longer recommending a phaseout of paper dollars in favor a dollar coin.
Jim Young/Reuters Who says a dollar doesn't go as far as it used to?
When it comes to dollar bills , a new report from the federal government says they're lasting more than twice as long as they were at the beginning of the decade.
And that's upending an old argument about replacing the dollar bill with a $1 coin.
Analysts have long argued the federal government could save money by making the switch because even though coins cost more to mint, they last much longer than paper money. In 2011, the Government Accountability Office estimated the savings at $5.5 billion over 30 years.
Planet Money Should We Kill The Dollar Bill? But a second look from the GAO flips that coin argument on its head. Analysts now say the government would lose between $611 million and $2.6 billion over 30 years by phasing out the dollar bill. The economics have shifted because dollar bills are lasting longer.
""When we last looked at this issue in 2011, the paper dollar was only lasting a little bit over three years,"" said John Shumann, an assistant director at the GAO. ""When we looked at this issue again this year, we found that the paper dollar is now lasting almost eight years long.""
Shumann said that's partly because of changes in the way the Federal Reserve processes dollar bills. But it's also a sign that in an increasingly cashless world, paper dollars aren't getting around like they used to.
""They're often showing less signs of wear and tear,"" Shumann said.
As part of its research, the GAO surveyed lots of industries that might have a stake in the paper-versus-coin contest, and found most are not eagerly embracing the switch to $1 coins.
Presidential Dollar Coin Program $1 Billion That Nobody Wants Even the Coin Laundry Association.
""You know, it's right in our name,"" said CEO Brian Wallace, whose group represents some 30,000 self-service laundries around the country.
Despite the name, only a handful of those businesses currently accept $1 coins. Meanwhile, alternative payment options have proliferated.
""You could still pay with a quarter,"" Wallace said. ""But you could also pay with a credit card or add value to a card. Or taking the Starbucks approach of just waving the phone at the washer and it starts.""
Other businesses long associated with coins have also moved on.
""Once upon a time, toll roads, along with transit systems and the post office itself were the largest coinage handlers in the country,"" said Neil Gray, director of government affairs for the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association.
Not anymore. Fewer than one in five toll-road users pay cash today.
""To the extent possible, we've had entire toll road systems eliminate cash completely,"" Gray said.
Business Sweden's Cashless Experiment: Is It Too Much Too Fast? Even slot machines have largely done away with coin slots.
(One exception is the gumball machine industry, which told the GAO it could offer higher-quality gum and toys if more people carried $1 coins.)
The new GAO report may discourage congressional efforts to phase out the dollar bill. In any case, $1 coins have proven stubbornly unpopular with the public. That's why the Fed has more than a billion of the coins sitting unused, in storage."
Mary Laura Philpott Discusses Her New Memoir 'I Miss You When I Blink',www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169887/mary-laura-philpott-discusses-her-new-memoir-i-miss-you-when-i-blink?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Audie Cornish speaks to author Mary Laura Philpott about her new book of essays I Miss You When I Blink.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
There's a roadmap for a certain kind of memoir. A woman realizes her life isn't working, so she blows it up and hits the road. Mary Laura Philpott's new memoir does not follow that path.
MARY LAURA PHILPOTT: I have not bought a Corvette. I have not sold all my belongings and put on a backpack and traveled the world. I did not have 20 extremely smooth years of adulthood and then just blow it all up. I've had what I feel like are more like a series of small identity crises every few years where I have to recalibrate a little bit.
SHAPIRO: The book is called ""I Miss You When I Blink,"" and it's about how to stay in your life, how to do the hard work that it takes to get to OK, even if your relentless perfectionism tends to get in the way. My co-host Audie Cornish spoke with Mary Laura Philpott earlier.
AUDIE CORNISH, BYLINE: So let's talk about some of the stories here because they are essays.
PHILPOTT: Yes.
CORNISH: But they do build. There is a kind of arc.
PHILPOTT: Yeah.
CORNISH: And I want to talk about one called ""The Perfect Murder Weapon,"" which is not a title I expected to read.
(LAUGHTER)
CORNISH: But this is about, I think, a humorous idea of the desire to plan in the perfect murder or, essentially, is it about that or about critiquing crimes that have already happened?
PHILPOTT: It's about the need to plan the perfect everything. It's about going through life as a perfectionist, self-aware enough to know that I'm a perfectionist but unable to resist the need to get every little thing right, including things that are none of my business. Like when I watch a crime show on television, staying awake all night and rethinking the crime and how I would have done it better and gotten away with it.
CORNISH: I want you to read a passage from this essay. It's on page 21.
PHILPOTT: OK.
CORNISH: And it begins, I'm making it sound like...
PHILPOTT: Yes.
(Reading) I'm making it sound like being this way is fun, like it's a hilarious quirk. But to be clear, it's also miserable. I hate that I can't relax. I wish I didn't have a to-do list in my peripheral vision at all times. It's an exhausting way to live, but try as I might, I can't turn it off. My brain seeks tasks to check off, I's to dot and T's to cross, not to mention X's to slash, E's to loop and Z's to zag, the way a sort-of-but-not-really reformed smoker sucks in a deep lung full of nicotine when walking past a crowd of smokers outside a bar. Like any high-functioning addict, I've learned to sneak a hit wherever I can. When the pediatrician gives me my kids' growth charts, I look for the percentages first. When the water meter guy handed me a report with our latest meter reading, I scanned it for a score and asked, is this good? I can sustain a buzz for hours after anyone tells me that something I've done was the best, even if it's just a colleague at the bookstore where I work saying, hey, Mary Laura, you're the best at changing the toilet paper roll in the employee bathroom. Bam - better than a shot of tequila.
CORNISH: So this sounds exhausting.
PHILPOTT: Indeed.
CORNISH: How do you short-circuit these tendencies?
PHILPOTT: Oh, gosh. I don't know that I've ever really mastered short-circuiting these tendencies. I try to just...
CORNISH: Wait. Do you want to? I should ask that.
PHILPOTT: Well, so yes and no. I mean, I - one of the things that I work through in this book is coming to the understanding that perfectionism and a desire to do things right has led to some really great things in my life. It has also led to a lot of exhaustion and sometimes even depression.
So I feel like the best thing I can do is just be aware of it and maybe catch myself sometimes when I'm spending that effort on things that aren't worth spending it on.
CORNISH: I hope you don't mind me saying this, but there are some aspects of the book that feel like you're, like, the chipper PTA mom that usually in movies is a villain or a bad guy because they're, like, doing everything right.
PHILPOTT: Right. Right.
CORNISH: And then, like, the bad mom strolls in with Converse sneakers. And it's like, I don't care. Anyway, but you're the villain in that story (laughter).
PHILPOTT: I love it. I'd rather be the villain.
CORNISH: But were you nervous about, you know, the idea of, like, privilege - people reading this and being like, this woman is having a severe case of first-world problems.
PHILPOTT: Oh, absolutely, and not just in writing the book, in my life, when I would have thoughts about - I don't feel happy right now. I would then immediately feel guilt at not feeling happy. And I would look at my life and go, I have everything to be happy about. I have a roof over my head. I have enough money for groceries. Everyone in my immediate family is alive and well.
I don't deserve to get to think about problems. And not letting yourself think about a problem doesn't make the problem go away. It just buries it deeper so that it's more of an explosion when it comes to the surface.
CORNISH: A lot of this book also talks about how you maintain an identity or how one maintains an identity outside of being a partner, outside of getting a parent.
PHILPOTT: Yes.
CORNISH: This is a question, obviously, that women have talked about for a very long time. Which brings me to chicken salad because...
PHILPOTT: (Laughter).
CORNISH: There is - let's just call - I'll call it a chicken salad incident in an essay called ""Sports Radio.""
PHILPOTT: (Laughter) Yes.
CORNISH: Set up the story for us.
PHILPOTT: OK. So the essay is called ""Sports Radio"" because I begin by saying, one thing I have never understood is the fascination with sports. I just don't get it, and I feel left out. And then I sort of make the tie over to a memory that I have of a dinner party, and it was all women. And I was sitting at this dining room table. And somebody starts a conversation about what we were eating, which was chicken salad.
And the conversation went on and on. I swear it must have been 19 minutes, down to this minutia of, well, do you put grapes in it? And do you slice the grapes? And do you boil the chicken or do you bake it? And I sat there just seething, having the same feeling that I feel when I listen to sports radio.
Like, we're out for the night. Why aren't we talking about bigger, more interesting things? And I thought, why am I so angry? And if everyone else is excited about chicken salad and I'm not, then something must be wrong with me.
CORNISH: I'm going to put in a vote for you're normal and chicken salad's not that interesting.
PHILPOTT: Thank you. But one of the things I didn't want to feel, but I was feeling in that moment, was - are all of these women talking about chicken salad like it's the most important thing in the world because they've had kids and now they're obsessed with domestic things? And I didn't want to think that because I don't believe that. But I was - that thought was entering my mind, and it was really bothering me.
CORNISH: I don't know if you've had any friends read the book yet, but have you had someone say, yo, MLP, I don't care about chicken salad. I just was at the party talking like everyone else.
PHILPOTT: You know what?
CORNISH: Why didn't you say something?
PHILPOTT: You know what? I've had both. I've had friends reach out and say, thank you so much for writing that chicken salad story. I've been stuck in so many chicken salad conversations that I couldn't wait to get out of.
And then I also had a friend say, you know what, it sort of hurts my feelings that thing you wrote about the chicken salad because when I was in the chicken salad years, I was just trying to survive that phase of life. And I was interested in those things because that's what was right in front of me at that time.
CORNISH: You know, at the end of the day, so much of - so many of the essays kind of spoke to the idea of reinvention.
PHILPOTT: Yes.
CORNISH: Not just the idea of saying, I think something needs to change, but then, like, the really hard work of making yourself do that.
PHILPOTT: Yes.
CORNISH: What do you want people to take away from watching you go through this process?
PHILPOTT: I guess if you take away anything, it's that you can screw up and try again and that reinvention can be something that happens in small, repeated ways versus one huge way. If the only reinvention stories you've read are the really big blow-up-your-life kind, then reinvention can seem really daunting. But there are other ways to do it, and there are different times to do it. You don't have to wait till your 40th birthday and then blow up your life.
CORNISH: Mary Laura Philpott. Her new book of essays is called ""I Miss You When I Blink."" Thank you so much for speaking with us.
PHILPOTT: Thank you for having me.

Arizona GOP Lawmakers Propose New Laws To Remove Some People From Early Voting List,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169880/arizona-gop-lawmakers-propose-new-laws-to-remove-some-people-from-early-voting-l?station=KXJZ_FM,"After Democrats surged to new levels of success in Arizona last fall, Republican state lawmakers there have proposed new voting laws that could make casting a ballot there more complicated.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Turnout was way up in the 2018 midterms, and in the southwest, that translated into gains for Democrats. Now Republicans in some southwestern states are pushing bills that change the rules around voting. Critics say these changes are designed to reduce turnout in future elections. From Phoenix, KJZZ's Bret Jaspers reports on how it's playing out in Arizona.
BRET JASPERS, BYLINE: Republicans had full control of Arizona's politics until last fall, then, after Democratic turnout surged, they lost 4 out of 9 statewide races including, a U.S. Senate seat. Now Republicans in the legislature are proposing new voting rules that could make it more complicated to cast a ballot. One change would remove some people from the permanent early voting list.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MICHELLE UGENTI-RITA: It says permanent early voting list. I don't know why everyone keeps ignoring the operative word, which is early.
JASPERS: That's the bill's sponsor, Republican State Senator Michelle Ugenti-Rita. People on the permanent early voting list get ballots mailed to them so that they can mail them back or drop them off on Election Day. Ugenti-Rita wants counties to purge people from that list if they don't vote using an early ballot in two consecutive election cycles.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UGENTI-RITA: We want to make sure that the lists are up to date. That's just good practice. That makes sense on, frankly, any kind of database that you have that you're really communicating with those who want to be communicated with and that are using the service. This is a service. It's a convenience.
JASPERS: Local election officials say they already have ways to maintain clean voting rolls. The Arizona secretary of state's office estimates 200,000 voters currently on the permanent early voting list didn't vote in both 2016 and 2018. But the office also says the bill's language is unclear, making it hard to estimate the impact. Democratic Representative Athena Salman calls it voter suppression to purge the permanent early voting list known as PEVL - or PEEVL (ph).
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ATHENA SALMAN: There is a great debate around whether or not it is PEHVL (ph) or PEEVL.
(LAUGHTER)
SALMAN: But I find it fitting that, if this bill passes, the list will no longer be permanent. And so one might call it EEVL (ph).
JASPERS: Republicans dispute this is an attempt to make voting more difficult. The bill doesn't remove people from the registration rolls, just the mailing list for early ballots. Some local officials say it will create more confusion. Republican lawmakers have proposed other bills this legislative session that have drawn criticism from voting rights groups, including one that bans paying workers for each voter registration form they turn in.
DANIELLE LANG: We are seeing both the good and bad side of the fallout of the 2018 election.
JASPERS: Danielle Lang is an attorney with the Campaign Legal Center, which works with voting rights groups across the country, including in Arizona. She says lawmakers often re-examine voting laws after an election. For example, there's a push from Iowa's Republican governor to make it easier for convicted felons to restore their right to vote after release. That effort is bipartisan, unlike Arizona's bill, which has advanced along party lines.
LANG: All Americans care about election integrity, and yet these issues get framed in very unhelpful partisan ways.
JASPERS: Republicans control the Arizona legislature. The bill to purge the permanent early voting list still has to pass the full House. GOP Governor Doug Ducey's office says it doesn't comment on pending legislation. For NPR News, I'm Bret Jaspers in Phoenix.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:
The Trump administration has taken an unprecedented step in its bid to put pressure on Iran. It has designated part of Iran's military, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, as a foreign terrorist organization. NPR's Michele Kelemen reports on what that means.
MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says this is the first time the U.S. is putting part of another government on the same terrorism list that includes al-Qaida and ISIS.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MIKE POMPEO: We're doing it because the Iranian regime's use of terrorism as a tool of statecraft makes it fundamentally different from any other government.
KELEMEN: The U.S. accuses the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps of supporting militants across the Middle East - providing Iraqis, for example, with roadside bombs that killed hundreds of Americans during the Iraq War. Now anyone who supports the IRGC could face criminal charges.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
POMPEO: If you're the general counsel for a European financial institution today, there's more risk. It is absolutely the case that the IRGC amounts to a significant piece of the Iranian economy through pure kleptocracy.
KELEMEN: Advisers to President Trump say he wanted to take this step for a long time. Pentagon officials, though, have raised concerns about what this could mean on the ground. A former sanctions adviser, Elizabeth Rosenberg, puts it this way.
ELIZABETH ROSENBERG: People are concerned that it makes it more difficult to work together when necessary. Perhaps that means sharing information to make sure that there's not a military mishap.
KELEMEN: In Syria or Iraq, for instance. Rosenberg, who is with the Center for a New American Security, doesn't really see the upsides since the IRGC faced other sanctions already.
ROSENBERG: It doesn't change the amount of economic pressure on Iran, and it makes it harder to seek denouement or a climbdown with Iran in the future if political circumstances should make that feasible.
KELEMEN: The State Department's point person on Iran, Brian Hook, though, insists this move will not hamper diplomacy. He says the Middle East won't be stable unless the IRGC is weakened. A top Iranian official says the U.S. approach will fail.

How Venezuela's Currency Became So Worthless,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169832/how-venezuelas-currency-became-so-worthless?station=KXJZ_FM,"Migrants fleeing Venezuela sell art made from nearly worthless Venezuelan currency. NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Northwestern University's Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez about what happened to the currency.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Here's one vivid illustration of how much trouble Venezuela's economy is in. I was recently in the city of Cucuta on Colombia's border with Venezuela, and I met a man creating paper sculptures for sale by the side of the road. Jorge Cordero is 19 years old. He weaves and braids paper into swans, purses, owls, trucks. And all of the paper is Venezuelan currency - bolivars.
JORGE CORDERO: (Through translator) The bill itself isn't worth anything anymore. It doesn't have any value. People will throw it away, they'll tear it up. And that's why I started using the bills to make bags and other things.
SHAPIRO: How much money do you get for selling a small purse like this? How much do you charge?
CORDERO: (Through interpreter) Well, the small one is 30, 40, 50,000 thousand Colombian pesos - so $10, $15. But you're not paying for the cash. You're paying for the work.
SHAPIRO: When you were a child, this was worth a lot of money. How does it feel today to see how worthless it is?
CORDERO: (Through interpreter) I never imagined working with money. I used to make these things out of magazines or candy wrappers. Back in the day, this stack of cash would be a ton of money. You could buy food, give some extra to your girlfriend. Now it's worthless.
SHAPIRO: To explain how Venezuela's currency became so worthless, I called up Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez at Northwestern University. He studies the economies of Latin America. He told me Venezuela built its entire economy on oil, and it boomed for decades after World War II. When Lansberg-Rodriguez was a kid in the '90s, going back and forth between the U.S. and Venezuela, inflation had started to creep up, but it was nowhere near what it is today.
DANIEL LANSBERG-RODRIGUEZ: It has sort of gone from kind of a joke, to a cautionary tale, to a Shakespearean tragedy.
SHAPIRO: The story of Venezuela's economic collapse is long and complicated. And so if you'll indulge me grossly oversimplifying things...
LANSBERG-RODRIGUEZ: Sure.
SHAPIRO: ...Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's last leader, built the economy on oil and imported everything from clothing to food. Then, in 2013, Nicolas Maduro replaces Chavez. And the next year, oil prices crater. What does that mean for Venezuela?
LANSBERG-RODRIGUEZ: Venezuela was already in recession. Venezuela was already - had oil production that was falling and declining very quickly. So there were already a lot of problems. At the same time, a lot of other petro states - Kuwait, Brazil even managed to save a great deal of money because there is an understanding that oil prices go up and they go down. Venezuela used that period to sort of project a lot more influence abroad. They were subsidizing other economies, and that left very little money in the till for when oil prices actually dropped.
SHAPIRO: That explains why the economy would tank and become weak, but it doesn't necessarily explain why the currency would become worthless. So what created the hyperinflation?
LANSBERG-RODRIGUEZ: So hyperinflation basically was created by two factors. The first was, since there was very little money coming in from oil rents - because oil had suddenly become very cheap - and the government didn't feel it was strong enough to actually make fiscal reforms, which tend to be unpopular, you have a situation where the government is essentially running the printing presses full time and using that to pay off any sort of domestic debt.
SHAPIRO: So you print money like crazy, and the money becomes more or less worthless.
LANSBERG-RODRIGUEZ: Exactly - because of supply and demand, essentially. You have a certain number of goods in the country, which are generally imported because Venezuela produces very little domestically other than oil. And that creates a situation where your money supply is growing, growing, growing. Anything that's not money supply is remaining relatively stable. So the amount of money it takes to actually procure anything ends up going up.
SHAPIRO: That's one aspect of it, but then there's also a psychological component. Explain what role that plays.
LANSBERG-RODRIGUEZ: When people start noticing this, especially people who had already lived with high inflation, people start hedging against that very quickly. And in Venezuela, that's what's essentially created this perfect storm. People treat the bolivar, and have for some time, as essentially an ice cube that you take out of the fridge. And you better have something to do with this ice cube because it's melting the moment it's out of the fridge.
In Venezuela, when people are paid every 15 and every 30 of the month, that's the ice cube game. They have to try and find out, what am I going to do with this paycheck in bolivars that's going to make that value last a lot longer than the coin that I think is already worthless and is going to be more worthless tomorrow than it is today.
SHAPIRO: Lansberg-Rodriguez told me breaking out of that psychological trap is exactly what Venezuela must do to get out of this economic death spiral.
LANSBERG-RODRIGUEZ: The most key component to getting out of a hyper-inflationary cycle, to breaking it, is essentially to win the psychological game. It's not about stopping the presses at this point. It's about convincing Venezuelans - and to some extent, international markets - that the bolivar tomorrow is going to be worth roughly the same as the bolivar today. And with this government, which has very little credibility, you know, towards any semblance of fiscal or economic reform, the chances that anything could realistically change while Maduro is in charge are essentially nil.
So this government right now is not in a position where it could credibly try and tack and say, we're going to make a bunch of long overdue economic reforms. We're going to fix this. Give us the benefit of the doubt. It's sort of gone beyond that. And the sanctions raise the stakes on foreign governments to give Venezuela the benefit of the doubt absent very marquee credible change.
SHAPIRO: That was Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez. He teaches at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management and consults on Latin American risk at the Greenmantle firm.

Golden State Warriors Say Goodbye To Oakland Arena,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169825/golden-state-warriors-say-goodbye-to-oakland-arena?station=KXJZ_FM,"After 47 years in Oakland, the Golden State Warriors are moving to a shiny new arena across the bay in San Francisco. The Warriors are just the latest beloved sports team to leave the city.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Last night the Golden State Warriors clinched the No. 1 seed in the NBA's Western Conference, and they officially said goodbye to an old friend.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED SPORTS COMMENTATOR: Damion Lee's got it - and the final regular-season seconds of 47 years in this incredible building.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
That incredible building is Oracle Arena in Oakland, the Warriors' home for nearly half a century. Warriors coach Steve Kerr spoke to fans before the game.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
STEVE KERR: Warriors fans have stuck with us through thick and thin.
(APPLAUSE)
KERR: And let's be honest; most of those years have been a little thin.
CHANG: A little thin is kind of like saying the sun is a little warm. The Warriors were awful for a long time. They missed the playoffs for 12 straight seasons at one point and went 40 long years between championships.
SHAPIRO: But even during those long, lean years, attendance numbers were much better than a terrible team playing in a decrepit arena might expect.
CHANG: And when the Warriors were great - like, when they were winning three of the last four NBA titles - Oracle Arena turned into what fans called Roaracle (ph).
(SOUNDBITE OF CROWD ROARING)
SHAPIRO: Marcus Thompson is a sports columnist for The Athletic and an Oakland native. He says Oracle was more than just the place where the local NBA team played.
MARCUS THOMPSON: For me, growing up, Oracle was just always that place that symbolized something new was happening. Something fun was happening. Something lively was happening. And if you, like, worked hard enough and believed in yourself, you could be part of that. Like, it was just right there.
CHANG: He says he has not wrapped his head around the Warriors' impending move to San Francisco. It's the latest event in Oakland's fraught history with pro sports teams. The NFL's Raiders are leaving for a second time. And Oakland's Major League Baseball team remains in the Bay Area for now, but it's been trying to leave for decades. So why are Oakland fans so loyal to teams that are always looking for another place to play?
THOMPSON: Because it never was the teams. Nobody's there for that. You're there for the camaraderie. You're there for the family atmosphere. You're there because it's a symbol, you know, to be there. Oracle - I remember they were losing. They were terrible. But it felt like everybody who was doing something well with their lives was in Oracle.
SHAPIRO: The Warriors will play in the Chase Center, their waterfront arena in San Francisco, next season. And their historic success on the court might continue. But it's hard to imagine the Warriors' shiny new home could ever touch the magic of Roaracle Arena.

A Look At The History Of The America Is 'Full' Phrase Trump Has Used A Lot Recently,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169817/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-america-is-full-phrase-trump-has-used-a-lot-recentl?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Mark Hetfield, president of the refugee organization HIAS, about President Trump's comments that America is ""full,"" and how that message is reminiscent of far-right rhetoric in Europe.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Now we're going to dig into the history of a phrase that President Trump has been using a lot lately. During a visit to a U.S. Border Patrol station in California on Friday, he said this.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Can't take you anymore - we can't take you. Our country is full. Our area's full. The sector is full - can't take you anymore. I'm sorry.
SHAPIRO: He doubled down on those remarks Saturday before the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: Can't come in - our country is full. What can you do? We can't handle any more. Our country is full - can't come in. I'm sorry. It's very simple.
(CHEERING)
SHAPIRO: And then yesterday he tweeted, our country is - all caps - FULL. Trump's comments were directed at Central American migrants. In other countries, far-right leaders are using the same phrase to reject people from Syria, North Africa and other parts of the world. Mark Hetfield is president and CEO of HIAS, the Jewish nonprofit organization that helps resettle refugees here in the U.S. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
MARK HETFIELD: Thank you, Ari.
SHAPIRO: That line, our country is full, has a particular resonance for Jews. What echoes do you hear in that phrase?
HETFIELD: Well, we hear echoes dating back to 1921 when the door was slammed shut on people who were fleeing persecution. And we hear echoes from the saint - voyage of the St. Louis, which coincidentally occurred 80 years ago next month when that ship was turned away.
SHAPIRO: For people who aren't familiar with the St. Louis, we're talking about 1939. This was a ship carrying Jewish refugees that was turned back from the United States.
HETFIELD: Yeah, absolutely - to Germany, originally. And then they ended up distributing many of them in other - many of the 937 passengers who were sent back - to other European countries. And over 250 of those perished.
SHAPIRO: We heard participants in the Republican Jewish Coalition cheering President Trump's remarks over the weekend. And President Trump has stressed his support for Israel. It doesn't seem that he was trying to echo rhetoric of the Holocaust, does it?
HETFIELD: Well, I don't want to make comparisons with the rhetoric of the Holocaust. But what I will say is that the entire system of asylum protection and refugee protection in this country and in the world was built on the ashes of the Holocaust to make sure that never again would people be trapped inside of a genocide or trapped inside of a country where they are facing persecution.
And so to hear him make those comments on Shabbat to the Republican Jewish Coalition that asylum is a scam and that our country is being invaded - the same word that the murderer used who went into the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh about people who are coming to this country - I mean, that was deeply offensive to us at HIAS.
SHAPIRO: Your organization's mission is resettling refugees in the United States. So you're not a disinterested observer. Border crossings have nearly doubled over a year ago. Border Patrol caught almost a hundred thousand people entering the U.S. from Mexico last month, the highest number in more than a decade. So setting aside the echoes of the phrase our country is full, do you think there is any point where the number of people trying to come into the U.S. just becomes too great?
HETFIELD: Well, we have not come close to reaching that point. Instead, what's been happening is the machinery that's been developed to decide whether or not these people need protection has been totally broken. This administration - one of the first things that they did was they closed down the only legal route that Central American minors had to get to the United States. So now they're forced to take this route because they are running for their lives. The president wanted to build a wall for $5 billion. The budget of the immigration court system is less than a tenth of that per year.
SHAPIRO: OK.
HETFIELD: But he's not investing in that.
SHAPIRO: Mark Hetfield is president of HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit that resettles refugees in the United States. Thanks so much.
HETFIELD: Thank you, Ari.

What's Next For Immigration As Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen Leaves,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169809/what-s-next-after-nielsen?station=KXJZ_FM,"President Trump has signaled he'll take a tougher approach to immigration after the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and as migrant families continue to cross the border.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
A number of top officials at the Department of Homeland Security are on their way out. That includes the top official - Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Today, outside her home in Virginia, she said she was working to ensure a smooth transition.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN: I share the president's goal of securing the border. I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border.
CHANG: DHS has been unable to stop a surge of migrant families from crossing the southern border. That has clearly frustrated President Trump, and he's signaled that he now wants to take an even tougher approach. NPR's John Burnett is on the line with us from Austin to talk about what that tougher approach might look like. Hey, John.
JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Hello, Ailsa.
CHANG: So, first, do we even know why Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen left? I mean, how much of a surprise was her departure?
BURNETT: Well, it was pretty abrupt. And she hasn't said exactly what her reasons for leaving were. In her resignation letter, there were definitely hints at her frustration. She said, I hope the next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America's borders.
Her defenders say she was really in an impossible situation. There is only so much federal agents can do to prevent people from crossing the border to ask for asylum unless Congress changes some laws. But the president's been growing really impatient with her for months.
CHANG: I mean, speaking of the courts, as she mentioned in that quote you just read, later today there was some news out of a federal court in California about the administration's policy of sending some asylum-seekers to Mexico to wait for their court dates.
BURNETT: That's right. One of her signature efforts to discourage asylum-seekers was this program that forces them to wait in Mexico while their cases work through U.S. immigration courts. DHS called it migrant protection protocols.
San Francisco Judge Richard Seeborg slapped a preliminary injunction on DHS and said you can no longer send immigrants back to Mexico. He said his order would take effect on Friday and that the 11 migrant plaintiffs should be allowed into the U.S. The policy was sort of in an experimental phase. It began at the San Diego border crossing in January. And it was recently expanded to Calexico and El Paso.
The ACLU, which argued the case, had this reaction - quote, ""try as it may, the Trump administration cannot simply ignore our laws in order to accomplish its goal of preventing people from seeking asylum in the United States."" And there's been no response yet from DHS.
But, Ailsa, it just shows you how difficult that Nielsen's tenure has been. So many Trump immigration initiatives have been blocked by federal courts.
CHANG: I mean, I can imagine it must be doubly frustrating, all these federal court decisions against the administration, and now, the historic number of border crossings by families and unaccompanied children.
BURNETT: Exactly. Later this week, the Border Patrol expects to report that there were more than 100,000 apprehensions in March alone. Immigration officials have just lately been gloomy about how their system is overwhelmed, talking about reaching the breaking point. DHS has had to pull agents from all across the system to pitch in at the border, processing all these immigrant families. And so immigration hardliners think that DHS is sort of waving a white flag.
CHANG: So if the administration wants to have more bolder actions, what kind of bold actions do we expect them to take?
BURNETT: Well, DHS has been in sort of a bunker mode and isn't talking about it. But Trump clearly wants an aggressive new team over immigration. I spoke with several immigration conservatives who were influential with the administration today, and they see three aggressive policy options on the table.
First, change the rules so that ICE can detain families together indefinitely until their asylum cases are adjudicated and they can be deported - and build tent camps to hold them on the border because there's not nearly enough room in ICE detention centers. And if they go that course, it will lead - it would lead to yet another big battle in federal court. We just saw this one come out in San Francisco.
Second, flood the zone with asylum officers, immigration judges and ICE attorneys, put migrants on what they call the rocket docket - turn them around and send them home. Of course, again, immigration lawyers are extremely leery, saying it will violate an asylum-seeker's due process.
And third, some hardliners are saying a version of family separation remains under consideration at the White House. So overall, the endgame is deterrence - convince Central Americans it's just no longer a good idea to cross the border.
CHANG: I'm struck that you mentioned family separation. They already tried family separation, and they gave up on it. So what would be different about it this time?
BURNETT: Well, back in October, DHS first floated this idea. And they've tried to rebrand it. A family that crosses the border unlawfully would be given a binary choice. They could decide if they want to give their child up, let the government put them in a youth shelter, or they could agree to be detained indefinitely together, possibly in a tent city. But this is really sort of a nuclear option. And it's so controversial, even among Trump boosters. They're not sure they want the administration to go there.
CHANG: That's NPR's John Burnett in Austin. Thanks, John.

Senators Set To Grill PBMs About Drug Costs : Shots - Health News,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/08/711139364/drug-industry-middlemen-to-be-questioned-by-senate-committee?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Sen.

toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, will lead the Senate Finance Committee's questioning Tuesday of executives from pharmacy benefit managers about drug costs.
Win McNamee/Getty Images Consumers, lawmakers and industry players all seem to agree that prescription drugs prices are too high. What they can't always agree on is whom to blame.
On Tuesday, though, fingers are expected to point toward pharmacy benefit managers, the industry's mysterious middlemen.
The Senate Finance Committee will hear from executives from the biggest pharmacy benefit managers, led by CVS Caremark and Cigna's Express Scripts.
""They're kind of a secret organization,"" says Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, of the pharmacy benefit managers. ""I ask people to explain what they're doing and nobody seems to give you the same answer twice."" Grassley is chairman of the Finance Committee and Tuesday's hearing is its third on drug prices this year.
Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, manage prescription drug benefits for insurance companies and employers. And because they control the medication purchases of millions of patients, they are tremendously powerful.
""They exist only because pharmaceutical prices got so high and they were a way to get some market power in there that was on the consumer side,"" says Len Nichols, a health economist at George Mason University. ""Now they've become so big and dominant that they are hurting pharma.""
Shots - Health News VIDEO: Little-Known Middlemen Save Money On Medicines — But Maybe Not For You How dominant? CVS Caremark negotiates drug prices, copayments and which drugs are preferred options for more than 92 million people in the U.S. Express Scripts covers another 83 million.
The companies are hired by insurance companies, or self-insured employers, to control spending on prescription drugs. The PBMs negotiate discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, but those discounts come in the form of confidential rebates that are paid to the PBMs after the drugs are purchased.
PBMs pass most of the rebates on to their clients, but they often keep a slice for themselves.
The PBMs dispute that they are withholding savings from their clients. ""While drug manufacturers would have people believe that PBMs are retaining these discounts, virtually all rebates and discounts are passed on to clients,"" said Tom Moriarty, executive vice president at CVS Health, in a February speech.
Some analyses show that PBMs actually do help reduce drugs prices.
""PBMs have saved money over the last decade by encouraging use of generics,"" says Dr. Walid Gellad , director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh.
A report from SSR Health , an investment research firm, says the net prices of brand-name prescription drugs fell 4.8 percent in the last quarter of 2018, even while list prices rose 4 percent. The declines came as pharmacy benefit managers refused to pay for some drugs altogether, opting for a competing brand that offered a better price.
Gellad says that evidence is murky, because the rebate system means that many drugs start at prices that are artificially high.
But critics say the system creates perverse incentives for drugmakers to set high prices for their products so they can offer larger percentage rebates. And they say sometimes PBMs benefit more when patients buy expensive drugs than when they buy cheaper ones.
Now the entire business model is under attack. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar in February proposed eliminating the rebate system that underpins the work of companies like CVS Caremark and Express Scripts.
Instead, Azar proposed, the companies would use their market power to negotiate discounts from drugmakers upfront that would be passed on in full to patients.
In comments on HHS' proposal to get rid of rebates, CVS said drugmakers — not PBMs — are to blame. ""Our data show that it is not rebates that are causing drug prices to soar and, in fact, list price is increasing at a faster rate for many drugs with small rebates than for drugs with substantial rebates,"" CVS wrote. ""The elimination of rebates may not only lead to higher net drug prices, but will undoubtedly lead to higher premiums across the Medicare Part D program.""
Tuesday's hearing comes six weeks after the leaders of seven pharmaceutical manufacturers appeared before the same committee to defend their pricing practices.
Those CEOs acknowledged that their prices are high for many patients, but they deflected blame onto pharmacy benefit managers.
""We want these rebates, which lower net prices, to benefit patients,"" said Olivier Brandicourt , CEO of Sanofi, which makes Lantus, one of the highest priced brands of insulin . Its list price has risen from $244 to $431 since 2013, according to the committee.
Shots - Health News 'We're Fighting For Our Lives': Patients Protest Sky-High Insulin Prices ""Unfortunately, under the current system, savings from rebates are not consistently passed through to patients in the form of lower deductibles, co-payments or coinsurance amounts,"" Brandicourt said in testimony prepared for the hearing.
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, who is the ranking member of the Finance Committee, had harsh words for the drug makers at the February hearing.
""I think you and others in the industry are stonewalling on the key issue, which is actually lowering list prices,"" he said. ""Lowering those list prices is the easiest way for consumers to pay less at the pharmacy counter.""
Grassley is also frustrated.
""The pharmaceutical companies pointed the finger at the PBMs. The PBMs point their finger at the pharmaceuticals. And then both of those are pointing their fingers at the at the health insurance companies,"" Grassley said.
""I'm not announcing another hearing,"" he continued. ""But it might be that if we get this finger-pointing going on all the time, we may want to get those three groups all at the same table to stop the finger-pointing."""

toggle caption Alex Trautwig/Courtesy Major League Baseball As MLB's Chief Diversity Officer, Renee Tirado oversees a number of initiatives to bring more women and people of color into all levels of the sport, from front offices to the field. She says, ""there's a lot to do.""
Alex Trautwig/Courtesy Major League Baseball Major League Baseball is staring down a gender problem. Despite initiatives meant to bring more women into its dugouts, executive offices and broadcast booths, everyone — including women in high-powered positions — believe things won't change quickly enough.
""Look, I think there's no sugar-coating this. There's a lot to do,"" said Renee Tirado, MLB's chief diversity officer.
In 2018, MLB earned a gender grade of C on the yearly report card issued by The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports. Essentially, that means 30 percent of employees in pro-baseball are women.
But MLB told KCUR that all across the league just 188 women work in baseball operations roles, doing things like looking for the best talent, negotiating contracts or scouring data to optimize player skills. That encompasses jobs in the commissioner's office plus all 30 teams and those teams' minor league systems.
I've been honored to sometimes be referred to as a trailblazer, but it's pretty exhausting when you blazed a trail and there's nobody following up behind you.
Jean Afterman, New York Yankees
And in 150 years of Major League Baseball, no woman has been a general manager or a head coach.
New York Yankees' Jean Afterman is one of only three women who've risen to the assistant general manager level.
""I've been honored to sometimes be referred to as a trailblazer, but it's pretty exhausting when you blazed a trail and there's nobody following up behind you,"" said Afterman, who is 62.
Working to improve the numbers, for real
While the conversation about gender parity in major league sports may not be new, there's a renewed focus. The NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers just hired two women as assistant coaches. Notre Dame women's basketball coach, Muffet McGraw, recently declared she was done hiring men for her staff and advocated for hiring more women as leaders in sports.
And ESPN analyst Jessica Mendoza , who like other women broadcasters , has been criticized for showing off her baseball smarts, joined the New York Mets' baseball operations staff as an advisor about a month before the season started.
There is no single definition of ""baseball operations"" across Major League Baseball. Twenty-four of the 30 teams confirmed to KCUR how many women they had in such roles, though some teams counted the media relations crew, and most counted administrative assistants, who often help with contracts and other important front-office functions.
We'll be in a meeting with everybody, and they look around, they're like, 'Wow, you really are the only female. That's weird.
Erika Sharp, dietitian, Kansas City Royals
The Kansas City Royals are among the top five teams with women in baseball operations roles across the major and minor leagues, MLB said. But on the pro team, the Royals, there is just one woman: lead dietitian Erika Sharp.
""I would say other people notice it more than I do,"" Sharp said. ""We'll be in a meeting with everybody, and they look around, they're like, 'Wow, you really are the only female. That's weird.'
""But ... it's just a typical day and they all treat me like their little sister. They call me little sis sometimes,"" she said.
Sharp, 30, is in her second season with the Royals, having previously worked with the San Francisco Giants, Arizona Cardinals and Phoenix Coyotes. She said she's been lucky in that she hasn't felt like her gender has been a determining factor, though she acknowledged that her profession as a dietitian is generally dominated by women.
Gender parity doesn't feel like a large hurdle to overcome, Sharp said, but it'll be key to build ""the confidence of the upcoming working class and generation of females entering in, that there are positions and you can do these things. You just have to go in and work hard like everyone else does.""
Tirado, MLB's chief diversity officer, said she is trying to evolve the game's ""culture to make this a sport of choice for women, whether it's networking, the business side or baseball operations.""
MLB is trying to do that with the Diversity Pipeline Program and a fellowship program for baseball operations roles. Both are meant to equalize the league's gender and racial hiring. Roughly 20 percent of MLB's workforce is racially diverse, earning it a B+ for racial diversity in the institute's report card.
It's a change from how MLB did things under former Commissioner Bud Selig. Afterman, the Yankees executive, referenced the ""Bud Selig rule."" As she described it, ""if you are going to hire anybody in a senior position in a baseball operations department or a manager, you had to interview a diverse candidate, and all that was was ticking a box without any meaning to it.""

Courtesy Emma Tiedemann She said teams would just report back to the commissioner that, 'I did exactly what you told me to ... and I'm going to just hire the white guy that I wanted to.'""
MLB's goal now, according to Tirado, is ""always to improve the numbers, but not improve the numbers for the numbers' sake.""
'Change comes very slowly'
Diversity programs may not always work as expected. A 2016 Harvard Business Journal report noted that as initiatives to promote diversity proliferated in the U.S., the percentage of white women who became managers increased by 7 percent from 1985 to 2000 and black men only budged by .3 percent from 1985 to 2014.
And by diversity, ""we're talking about who is part of the organization and who is not a part of the organization,"" said Geraldine Cochran, an assistant professor of physics at Rutgers University who has written about and advocates for diversity and inclusion efforts.
The Harvard report said that the most effective diversity initiatives rely on recruiting, mentoring and a diverse management staff, but Cochran insisted there's another component, too: examining whether the efforts are making a difference.
""There is no-one size fits all diversity plan that's going to work at every organization. It needs to be an iterative process of making the changes, and then doing research to see if those changes were actually successful, and doing research to find out where the actual problems in the organization are,"" she said.
Rare to see a woman
Diversity initiatives weren't a thing when Greg Pryor played in the majors in the 1970s and 1980s with the Texas Rangers, New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox and the Royals.
""I came through baseball when it was very rare to see a woman in the front office or very visible as they've been in regards to a baseball,"" said Pryor, who remembers when women in the media were just being let into clubhouses. The only woman he said he dealt with from a team standpoint was Nancy Faust, the organist at Comiskey Park in Chicago.
""A lot of times in baseball, that change comes very slowly,"" Pryor said. He said he thinks fathers are encouraging more daughters to go into the sports they love. Pryor's youngest daughter, for instance, works in the NFL.
San Diego Padres Assistant General Manager Josh Stein started out with the team in 2003, and he had the rare chance to work with a high-ranking woman — Priscilla Oppenheimer, who was the director of minor league operations. But, he noted, the Padres dropped off the radar for a little bit.
""Definitely there was, I would say, a little bit of a gap in terms of women working in the Padres' front office,"" he said. ""We've really seen an influx over the last few years of more and more applicants, more and more hires and some women doing great work in our baseball operations."" Currently, six women work in baseball operations for the Padres.
Stein said that the key to bringing more women into the game is having them start in entry-level roles.
""I think if you look at, regardless of gender, the folks in professional sports that have risen to the top, it typically starts with internships. It starts with very basic coaching positions or scouting positions,"" he said. ""And it tends to be a long, slow journey to the top.""
Among the up-and-comers is Emma Tiedemann, who is with the Royals' low-A minor league team in Kentucky. The 26-year-old has broken the gender barrier a couple of times already: in 2014 with the Alaska Baseball League and in 2018 in the South Atlantic League. Today, She does both the play-by-play and color during radio broadcasts for the Lexington Legends.
It runs in the family. Her grandfather was the broadcaster for the University of Texas at Dallas and at 15, Tiedemann joined him in the booth to keep score.
""[He] just handed me the headset and said, 'You know basketball, if you want to talk about what's going on in the game, feel free. But if you're too shy ... that's fine also.' I talked to the whole game ... and from there I was calling [NCAA] Division III athletics.""
But there were still barriers. She once had a minor-league baseball team tell her they wouldn't hire her because she's a woman.
""I was so taken aback that I was just kind of quiet and walked out of what I thought was going to be an interview just stunned,"" she said. ""But I used that to ... bring me back down to reality of this career path is going to be a little bit harder for me than my friends.""
Continues to have to 'justify herself'
The Yankees' Afterman said she still feels it necessary to ""sort of justify myself"" in meetings, even though she's a senior vice president, has been an assistant general manager for 18 seasons and negotiated contracts for star baseball players such as Hideo Nomo and Alfonso Soriano for several years before that.
Afterman sees potential in the emergence of analytics departments. Instead of trying to break in as a coach or a GM, women can develop ways to communicate advanced metrics to the coaches.
That was the route for Samantha Rack, who is with the Cincinnati Reds.
The 25-year-old previously worked in the health care sector as a developer, and said her experience since recently joining the Reds is that ""nothing feels abnormal"" because they're working toward the same goal.
Even though she might have had worries about working in a field dominated by men, ""I've not come across anything that would make me concerned,"" she said.
But even with the MLB's Diversity Pipeline Program, the fellowship program and an initiative called Take the Field , Tirado said progress will be slow. That's because, she said, MLB is still at the foundational stage of this building this diversity.
Baseball is a small world. Teams like humans, prefer familiarity in the hiring process, and what's familiar is men.
""I know that guy. And guy, I mean, literally. I know how he works, I know what he does, I know the way he thinks and it aligns with my philosophy,"" Tirado said. ""So we have to break through with that by giving women an opportunity to build out those relationships and show that they can compete at the same level as those men.""
Some of the encouragement is going to have to come from women like Tiedemann, who reaches out to any new woman broadcaster in baseball in hopes that they succeed and maybe even beat her to the major leagues, where currently there's one woman who's a color announcer — Suzyn Waldman with the Yankees' WFAN team — and one woman who's a public address announcer — Renel Brooks-Moon with the San Francisco Giants.
""I would love to not be a story,"" Tiedemann said, adding she wants to be ""just background noise.""
Like a player's walkup song or the call of a hot dog vendor a section or two over — just part of the game."
Felicity Huffman And 13 Others Plead Guilty In College Admissions Scandal,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169754/felicity-huffman-and-13-others-plead-guilty-in-college-admissions-scandal?station=KXJZ_FM,"Thirteen parents and one university athletic coach have agreed to plead guilty to charges of mail fraud and honest services mail fraud in connect with the college admissions scandal.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
One sports coach and 13 parents have agreed to plead guilty in the college admissions scandal that federal investigators have called Operation Varsity Blues. One of them - Felicity Huffman, the star of the show ""Desperate Housewives."" Anya Kamenetz of NPR's Education team has been following the story and joins us now. Hi, Anya.
ANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.
SHAPIRO: Tell us about this latest development with more than a dozen parents agreeing to plead guilty.
KAMENETZ: So the parents as well as one coach have agreed to plead guilty in connection with this scheme. And according to one of the plea agreements at least, they may serve a few months in jail as well as paying fines and restitution. And Felicity Huffman, the actress, as you heard, is one of the more high-profile people accused. But others, including Lori Loughlin, another actress from the TV show ""Full House,"" is among those originally accused who is continuing to fight the charges.
SHAPIRO: What are we hearing from the parents?
KAMENETZ: Well, two of those who plead - pled guilty today issued very contrite statements. Huffman's statement reportedly said, I am in full acceptance of my guilt - deep regret and shame. And she also reiterated that her daughter had no idea.
SHAPIRO: This story has gotten so much attention, and it seems to have really resonated with students and parents. Why do you think it has had such a big impact?
KAMENETZ: In a word, Ari - schadenfreude. I think at this moment, whether you look at politics or society in general, there is a lot of concern about fraud, about misrepresentation, people not being who they say they are, not to mention a lot of resentment of wealth and privilege and all the trappings that come with it. And the way this story has unfolded, the fact that these families really seem to believe that the rules should not apply to them - that's been galling to many people.
And then look at the setting, right? So elite colleges are the source of such cultural fascination. Some would say obsession. Highly selective colleges - you know, they only enroll about 1 percent of all college students. So they're very, very small. But then again, they have these brands that are known all over the world. And they're supposed to stand for merit, for hard work, for the best and the brightest.
And so when you look at something like this or, even bigger, the legacy admissions or the fact that some wealthy donors can write a check and get their kid into college that way supposedly, it - all of this is really going to undermine the idea of having institutions in our society that represent hard work and being kind of excellent.
SHAPIRO: So where do these cases go from here?
KAMENETZ: Well, you know, this is having a lot of different effects. So you know, some of the students have been expelled. Their admissions have been revoked. Some of the coaches have been fired. They face charges - athletic coaches who were involved in misrepresenting people as being recruits. And of course the legal cases are going to continue to unfold.
But I'm also interested in how it's unfolding in the broader culture at large. You know, whether you look at things like - we had a big debate last year about Harvard and affirmative action. And these conversations about things like legacy admissions are really bringing us to a broader conversation about, what do these elite colleges really offer? You know, the fact that they have nonprofit status - are they really serving the public, or are they just acting in a way that's really inflating their own bottom line and their own brands?
And so I think there's a broader conversation about, are there better ways to have admissions? And can we define excellence in education some other way other than, you know, something that's really expensive and only lets in about 5 percent of people who get to apply?
SHAPIRO: And for all that conversation, just in our last 30 seconds or so, do you see signs of systemic change coming?
KAMENETZ: I think that it's going to be a huge debate. I look forward to it in the presidential election, honestly.
SHAPIRO: NPR's Anya Kamenetz, thanks a lot.
KAMENETZ: Thanks, Ari.

Libya Could Descend Into War Again After Army General Launches Surprise Attack On Tripoli,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/711169747/libya-could-descend-into-war-again-after-army-general-launches-surprise-attack-o?station=KXJZ_FM,"Libya is once again facing instability as a renegade general leads forces attempting to oust the internationally-recognized government in Tripoli.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Libya, with its patchwork of militias and a weak central government, could be descending again into war. An Army general who controls part of the country has launched a surprise attack on the capital, Tripoli. The U.S. and other countries are evacuating soldiers and staff now. NPR's Jane Arraf has been following all of this from Amman, Jordan.
Hi, Jane.
JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Hi.
CHANG: So can you just describe what exactly is happening now in Tripoli?
ARRAF: So there are these forces that are advancing on the capital. And they had reached the disused airport on the outskirts of the capital. But now there's actually been an airstrike on the only functioning airport. Now, these are forces that have made their way to the outskirts of the city and now going into the center. Dozens of people have been killed, including civilians and soldiers. Almost 3,000 of them have been displaced. There are real concerns that this is actually the start of something. The U.N.'s special envoy for Libya says that they are effectively on the brink of what could be civil war.
CHANG: And this general, Khalifa Haftar, can you tell us a little bit more about him? Who is he?
ARRAF: He is a general who helped to bring deposed leader Moammar Gadhafi to power way back in 1969, and then they had a falling out. And he ends up in exile in the United States where he basically lived plotting to topple Gadhafi until Gadhafi was indeed toppled and killed in 2011. Then he came back. He gathered forces, and he actually took over part of the country, eastern Libya, including Benghazi.
This is a general who has the backing of the United Arab Emirates, which is important because they have a lot of money. He also has the backing of Egypt. So last week, after multiple threats, he popped up to announce that, indeed, this was it; he had ordered his forces to advance to take control of Tripoli, the capital.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
LIBYAN NATIONAL ARMY KHALIFA HAFTAR: (Through interpreter) Today we respond to the appeal of our people and our precious capital as we promised them. Their patience has reached an end. Today is our date with destiny to respond to the call of truth, an end to struggle and suffering and pain.
ARRAF: He's saying there that, basically, he was responding to the appeal of people in the capital saying they wanted him to come and, as he put it, liberate them. And he called it an appointment with destiny.
CHANG: Now, we mentioned that countries, including the U.S., are pulling their citizens out of Libya. Can you just tell us about that and what U.S. troops have been doing there?
ARRAF: So Libya really hasn't effectively been under control of any one party or any one government since 2011 basically - since Gadhafi was toppled. And that's made it particularly dangerous. There are ISIS-affiliated groups operating there, al-Qaida-affiliated groups. The U.S. has special forces operating there doing counterterrorism. So on the weekend, the U.S. military pulled out a contingent of troops. The Defense Department said the security was too uncertain to keep them there. And others have pulled out as well. The Italian oil company which is a big player in Libya's huge oil industry has evacuated its expat staff - its expatriate staff. India has pulled out peacekeepers. People are very, very nervous.
CHANG: So let's say the U.N.'s special envoy is correct. Let's say that this does get worse in Libya. What would be the regional impact?
ARRAF: Well, we saw in Benghazi in 2012 when militants attacked the U.S. diplomatic mission there and they killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, that this is really a country that has the potential to go very, very bad. There are all these militant groups operating there. It's a major oil producer. It's of particular concern to Europe because it's a major transit point for migrants and refugees crossing the Mediterranean from Libya to try to get to Europe.
So this is a country that really hasn't been stable. It's very precarious security. There's an internationally recognized government in Tripoli now under threat. So the implications of what happens if General Haftar manages to take the capital - those implications are very serious for what happens not just to Libya but security in the region.
CHANG: Yeah. That's NPR's Jane Arraf. Thank you, Jane.
ARRAF: Thank you very much.

Semi-Nomadic Himba Do A Good Job In A Psychological Test Of Flexible Thinking : Goats and Soda : NPR,www.npr.org,sports.yahoo.com,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/04/07/704853100/why-the-semi-nomadic-himba-are-so-good-at-thinking-outside-the-box?utm_source=pocket-newtab,"Why The Semi-Nomadic Himba Are So Good At Thinking Outside The Box Facebook Twitter Flipboard Email April 7, 2019 7:00 AM ET Jonathan Lambert
Enlarge this image Leigh Wells/Getty Images Leigh Wells/Getty Images Sarah Pope drives to work every day. It takes the cognitive neuroscientist 10 minutes to get to her lab at the University of Texas at Austin , and 10 minutes to get back home. She thought it was the fastest route, until one day a roadblock forced her to take a back road, which cut her commute time in half.
Why didn't she try the better route earlier? She says it's an example of a tendency to stick to the familiar way of solving a problem. Psychologists call it ""cognitive set."" Psychologists who are interested in the opposite kind of mindset – flexible thinking – have confirmed this bias toward the familiar in experiment after experiment.
But a study published in the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology earlier this year challenges this dogma by testing the flexible thinking of non-Western cultures – in this case, the semi-nomadic Himba people of Namibia.
The researchers found that when you assign a simple problem to the Himba and to a group of Westerners, the Himba are more cognitively flexible.
""These are exciting results,"" says Thea Ionescu , a developmental psychologist at Babeș-Bolyai University in Romania who was not involved in the study. ""There has been this implicit assumption that if we study Westerners, we study humankind,"" says Ionescu. ""This study suggests that's not necessarily the case.""
Flexible thinking is a fuzzy capacity for psychologists to describe and measure. But they generally think of it as our ability to incorporate past knowledge and the present context and add a bit of improvisational magic to solve problems well and quickly.
Now you don't always need to be flexible. Let's say your day-to-day existence is pretty much the same. ""If you're in an environment that is very predictable, the best solution is often the one that's always worked,"" says Pope .
In a more dynamic environment, where circumstances can change at the drop of a dime, there can be a benefit to breaking out of a rut and trying something new. But our bias towards the familiar can make it difficult to step out of our comfort zone.
To study the way we roll, psychologists have designed experiments that train participants to solve a problem one way, and then slip in the option of switching to a much faster method. Overwhelmingly, according to Pope, people tend not to take the shortcut. ""They continue with the learned approach, despite its inefficiency.""
Pope says that various versions of these tests have reached a similar conclusion, suggesting to the psychological community that ""cognitive set"" is an innate part of being human.
But Pope and Ionescu argue that conclusion is premature, because these studies have only considered WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) humans.
""WEIRD humans live in WEIRD environments at least evolutionarily speaking,"" says Pope. The fundamental workings of our minds were shaped thousands of years ago in environments vastly different than our present day surroundings. ""Only looking at Westerners limits the scope of our understanding of human cognition,"" says Pope.
To investigate cognitive flexibility in a non-WEIRD population, Pope traveled to Namibia to meet the Himba people. They live semi-nomadic lives in the remote deserts of northern Namibia.
""They are one of the few remaining remote cultures that actively resist Western influence,"" says Pope. Traditional Himba have virtually no formal education, and ""live in a much less predictable environment than Westerners,"" says Pope.
To compare cognitive flexibility across such vastly different cultures, Pope devised a simple test that didn't require language or math. A test subject looks at a touchscreen. A series of squares appear. The goal is to make them vanish.
With prompts, the subject learns that touching the squares in the order in which they appeared will make them disappear. Then a new batch of squares pop up, and the test subject starts over again.
But after a while, a triangle appears as well. You could stick to the strategy that worked before — touching the squares in a certain sequence to make them go away. But if you try something different — just touching the triangle — you'll achieve the goal faster: All the squares will vanish.
Pope found that fewer than 10 percent of Western subjects changed strategies unprompted. Most continued with the method they'd been taught, even though it's far less efficient.
By contrast, Himba participants chose the direct strategy approximately 40 percent of the time. In essence, they saw the triangle and figured, hey, why not try touching that?
According to Pope, these results suggest that Himba were more cognitively flexible. They were better able to switch away from a learned rule and use a shortcut when the opportunity presented itself.
But is this difference due to innate differences in problem solving between the groups? Or just by the fact that different groups can have different ideas of what counts as a problem or a solution?
To distinguish between these possibilities, Pope added a twist. Halfway through the trial, all 225 participants were nudged with the prompt: ""Don't be afraid to try new things.""
Upon hearing this, about 50 percent of Westerners tried the direct solution method, while the percentage of Himba who went for the triangle – about 40 – percent remained unchanged. Pope says this shows that the Westerners had the same ability to solve problems as the Himba – it's just that they weren't flexible in their thinking about the problem itself and possible solutions.
""I think Westerners are very limited in how they approach problems,"" says Pope. ""Obviously this is just one task and has to be replicated with other measures, but I think this does lay a foundation for understanding why Westerners are more focused on the familiar — something that is sufficient but not efficient.""
""Westerners would afterward say things like 'Oh, I didn't think I could do that' whereas the Himba seemed much more open to trying alternative solutions,"" says Pope.
According to Pope this study suggests cognitive set may be less ingrained in some cultures than others than previously thought. She has research plans to figure out why.
""One explanation may lie in education,"" says Pope. Formal education can train the mind to view problems in a certain kind of way. Without formal education, Himba may be freer to try different approaches. Understanding the relationship between education and creative problem solving could help resolve this question.
Another possibility is that different environments mold different ways of thinking. Lifestyles that are less predictable may require greater cognitive flexibility to survive.
""When you don't know where your food is going to come from when you wake up, it's important to be able to switch strategies if something isn't working,"" says Pope.
Pope says that she was struck by the willingness of the Himba ""to uproot their entire life at the drop of a hat,"" when water became scarce at a site they were living, or there was no more grass for their herds to eat.""
In their world, there's less permanency, ""which makes switching strategies an accepted part of their life.""
Our predictable Western lifestyles clearly offer benefits but they may come at the cost of less flexible thinking.

She’s also part of NPR’s energy and environment team, which coordinates coverage between the network and select member station reporters around the country. Her work frequently airs on NPR shows including Morning Edition, All Things Considered, and Weekend Edition. Since 2012, Marie has closely followed the political, social, environmental, and economic effects of Pennsylvania’s natural gas boom. Her work has been recognized at the regional and national levels– honors include a Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists and a national Edward R. Murrow Award from the Radio Television Digital News Association. Previously, Marie was a multimedia reporter for WMHT in Albany, New York and covered technology for the station’s statewide public affairs TV show, New York NOW. In 2018, she became StateImpact’s first FAA-licensed drone pilot.
Members of a state House committee heard a litany of arguments for and against a bill that would provide a $500 million annual subsidy to try to keep two of Pennsylvania’s five nuclear power plants from closing early.
Monday was the first public hearing on HB 11 , which was introduced last month and quickly condemned by a broad range of groups including consumer advocates, electric utilities, manufacturers, environmental organizations, and the natural gas industry. A companion bill was introduced last week in the state Senate.
The bills recognize nuclear plants as sources of carbon-free electricity and create new requirements about how electric utilities are to purchase power. They add nuclear energy to Pennsylvania’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard — a 2004 law mandating utilities buy power from certain clean and alternative energy sources, like wind and solar.
Both bills are designed to prevent the closure of Exelon’s Three Mile Island plant outside Harrisburg, and FirstEnergy’s Beaver Valley plant near Pittsburgh. They are slated for retirement within the next few years, as the nuclear industry has struggled amid flatlining demand for electricity, high operating costs, and competition from natural gas and renewables. Marie Cusick/StateImpact Pennslyvania Former governor and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge testifies at a House Consumer Affairs Committee Monday April 8, 2019.
Former governor and Department of Homeland Security Secretary, Tom Ridge, was the first to speak in favor of HB 11, arguing nuclear plants are important to Pennsylvania’s economy and U.S. national security.
“Pennsylvania’s historical leadership with nuclear energy is at risk,” Ridge told the House Consumer Affairs committee. “This [bill] will save jobs, keep America secure, and retain a critical asset to our energy infrastructure.”
Ridge had to be asked twice by legislators before disclosing his consulting firm, Ridge Global , counts FirstEnergy among its clients. He also noted he was a former board member at Exelon, but said his support for nuclear power formed long before he had any financial stake in it.
The nuclear industry argues the current design of the power market is flawed, because it’s focused on delivering the cheapest megawatt-hour of electricity in the immediate future and fails to consider the valuable long-term assets nuclear brings to the table — like carbon-free electricity, fuel-supply diversity, and reliability.
Debra Raggio, senior vice president for regulatory and external affairs at Talen Energy, which owns the Susquehanna nuclear power station in Luzerne County, told legislators their plant is making money and not scheduled for a shutdown, but it may be headed that direction.
“This legislation is putting us on a level playing field with what other zero-carbon producers are getting,” Raggio said. “It is legislation based on paying for an attribute. We would not have supported this legislation if it were a ‘bailout.’”
Opponents of the bill were quick to point out that all of Pennsylvania’s nuclear plants, except Three Mile Island, are profitable, and argue the nuclear industry is trying to paint a more dire picture in order to boost its bottom line. The natural gas industry stands to gain if nuclear plant retirements continue. It’s largely expected to fill the void in electric power generation.
“It’s our view there’s not the crisis that’s being portrayed,” said Todd Snitchler, vice president of market development of the American Petroleum Institute. “You have profitable plants that are projected to be profitable for the near-term.”
Consumer advocates also have concerns about HB 11. Desiree Hung, advocacy director for AARP Pennsylvania, said the state’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard passed in 2004 to give a boost to new and innovative renewable energy, “not bail out last century’s nuclear reactors that can’t compete any more in the electricity marketplace,” she told the committee. “AARP is not opposed to nuclear power, however we strongly oppose the imposition of a new surcharge on the backs of all Pennsylvania consumers and businesses that will increase their monthly bills.”
The prime sponsor of HB 11, Rep. Thomas Meffahie, said his bill will cost the typical residential customer an extra $1.77 per month.
Environmental groups were not represented at the House hearing Monday, but several have spoken out against HB 11 and its companion Senate bill for being too focused on nuclear energy and not doing enough to transition the state toward a cleaner energy future.
The future of both bills remains uncertain. Proponents hope to get legislation passed to aid the state’s nuclear plants by June. In recent years, other states, including New York, Illinois, New Jersey and Connecticut, have given billions of dollars in subsidies to keep their nuclear plants online. Links"
Federal Prosecutors Announce Guilty Pleas In College Admissions Scandal : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711314456/federal-prosecutors-announce-guilty-pleas-in-college-admissions-scandal,"Thirteen parents and one college coach have agreed to plead guilty in the college admissions cheating case that broke last month. One of the parents is actress Felicity Huffman.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
In some other news, federal prosecutors say 13 parents charged in a college admissions scandal have agreed to plead guilty in Boston federal court. Also pleading guilty is a former coach at the University of Texas at Austin. He is admitting he took bribes to accept a student on the tennis team.
Fred Thys from member station WBUR in Boston has more.
FRED THYS, BYLINE: One of the parents is actor Felicity Huffman. She's admitting she paid $15,000 to have someone else take her daughter's SAT exam. Huffman sent a letter to several media outlets in which she says, with deep regret and shame over what I've done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions.
The maximum penalty for the charge to which she's pleading guilty is 20 years in prison. But prosecutors are recommending Huffman serve a much lower sentence, in part because she's admitting her guilt. Law professor Douglas Berman teaches sentencing at Ohio State University.
DOUGLAS BERMAN: The government runs the numbers, so to speak, to result in a recommended sentencing range of four to 10 months of imprisonment, though they also say that they would only recommend the bottom of that range. So in a sense, they're calling for four months.
THYS: Huffman's attorneys are expected to ask for no prison time. The scandal has rocked the world of college admissions. Arun Ponnusamy, the chief academic officer of Collegewise, a national private college counseling service, says the lesson from this is much bigger than - parents should not bribe their children's way into college.
ARUN PONNUSAMY: I think the great lesson is to kind of let everyone kind of step back and think about, you know - what is the purpose of a college education, you know? What's the power of it transforming your life and who you can become?
THYS: No students have been prosecuted so far. But last week, the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, Andrew Lelling, said he and his prosecutors are still discussing whether to press charges against some students.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:
When, if ever, is it worth it for the United States to embrace an authoritarian leader? We're asking because President Trump is welcoming Egypt's leader, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, at the White House today. And this comes ahead of a crucial referendum that could change Egypt's constitution and allow Sissi to stay in office until the year 2034. Michele Dunne is with us. She served in the State Department for nearly two decades. She now runs the Mideast program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Welcome to the program.
MICHELE DUNNE: Thank you, David.
GREENE: So many consider Egypt's leader, I mean, even more authoritarian than his predecessors in Egypt. What is the argument for embracing him in moments like this?
DUNNE: First of all, Egypt is an important country. It's 100 million people in a very strategic location. And U.S. administrations often focus, in their Middle East policies, on Israel and on Iran. And that's certainly the case with the Trump administration. And they see the Arab countries, like Egypt, mostly as kind of instruments to be used in pursuing larger goals. So Egypt has always been particularly important regarding Israel. Obviously, it's had a peace treaty with Israel now for 40 years. And it's seen as an important player there, so it really can't be ignored.
That still doesn't justify inviting Sissi at a time when Sissi will really use this to show Egyptians he's got the full support of the United States to stay in power indefinitely, to take away the independence of the judiciary and give the military an even bigger role in the politics of the country. All of this will be now written into the constitution.
GREENE: So I know we're obviously only going to see part of this visit - like, the public part of it. Do you know if the Trump administration - even as, you know, we'll see the photo-ops and so forth - are they putting pressure on Sissi to reform, to do more for human rights behind the scenes?
DUNNE: I don't think this administration pursues this in any kind of a systematic way. I believe they do raise individual cases. For example, there are some - more than a dozen Americans held as political prisoners in Egypt right now. I think they pursue those cases. And they seem to have pursued, a bit, the draconian law on non-governmental organizations that Sissi put into place a couple of years ago. In fact, there was an announcement just before Sissi's arrival that they're going to abrogate that law and replace it.
Of course, that's just a promise. We don't know what will happen. But it seemed like they felt they had to say that before Sissi arrived. So there are a couple of specific things that the Trump administration will pursue on that file. I also think, David, that the Trump administration overestimates how much Sissi is going to be able to do for them on things like the Arab-Israeli peace process.
GREENE: Well, can you help me understand Sissi a bit better? I mean, you hear about complaints from human rights groups about his record all the time. But the Trump administration also has sort of portrayed him as a friend of women's rights, as an advocate for religious minorities, like Christians in his country. Are some of those characterizations fair?
DUNNE: Sissi does a really good job of talking the talk on issues like that. He says things. He makes public gestures like visiting a Christian cathedral on Christmas and things like that. So he does things like that in the public domain. But then when you look at his record - I mean, he's been in power for more than five years now. In terms of any changes in law, in government policies or practices, there's still a great deal of discrimination against Christians. Women's rights really haven't improved much. So he really hasn't done that much on those issues.
GREENE: Michele Dunne runs the Mideast program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Thanks a lot.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to focus now on the implications of the leadership change at the Department of Homeland Security - specifically, what Kirstjen Nielsen's departure as the head of DHS will mean for the president's immigration policies. Congress and the courts have been reining in the administration's immigration plans. Yesterday, a federal judge in San Francisco blocked Trump's plan to force asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico. What other steps might the president try in order to fulfill a campaign promise to limit immigration into the U.S.? Mark Krikorian is the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which has helped shape the Trump administration's policies on immigration. And he's in our studios this morning.
Thanks so much for being here.
MARK KRIKORIAN: Glad to be here.
MARTIN: Are you pleased to see Kirstjen Nielsen go at DHS?
KRIKORIAN: Yeah, I think it's long overdue. This job was not for her. She was in over her head. She's a cybersecurity person, and that she knows. And DHS does deal with issues like that. But the most pressing issues that DHS has been dealing with are, obviously, immigration-related issues. And she did not appreciate the urgency of this. We wrote about a year ago about how things were almost certainly going to be spinning out of control. And if we saw it, then they should have seen it, too.
MARTIN: Although she publicly backed all of the president's policies, including the very controversial policy of separating children from their families.
KRIKORIAN: This was something - it was a day late and a dollar short, I think, on her part. In other words, she came to appreciate the urgency to respond to this developing emergency on the border but much too late. And she just - I mean, she had to go. We really need a new approach - a more serious and urgent approach to deal with this developing emergency.
MARTIN: So what does that mean? When you say more serious and more urgent, what does that mean?
KRIKORIAN: There's a couple of things just that I think are worth touching on. First, we need to have a declaration and implementation of a mass migration emergency plan. That's actually something that exists. It's been developed for years - a response to mass arrival of people. It's been formulated to deal with seaborne migration emergencies, people from Haiti or Cuba arriving in huge numbers on rafts.
But this is the similar thing at the Mexican border. And what that would involve, for instance, would be tent cities the Army sets up next to existing detention facilities. So you hold people and don't let them go into the country 'cause that's really the key. We're letting people go, and then that's the end of the story. I mean, the rest - then they're gone, and that incentivizes people down in Central America to follow them because...
MARTIN: So you really can imagine the United States of America building tent cities to house asylum-seekers?
KRIKORIAN: Oh, absolutely. We've done it before. We - in Guantanamo, we did it with Cuban and Haitian rafters. And the point is that it - that by doing that, you take away the incentive for the mass arrivals 'cause the whole point is to use asylum as a - a claim of asylum as a strategy for illegal immigration to be released into the U.S.
The Guardian just had a story where they interviewed people - smugglers and prospective illegal immigrants in Guatemala. And they - and the people said, look. People - we're hearing from people who went to the border, were let in, released. And they're working. And they're - you know, they got away with it. And so more people will be following. That has to change.
MARTIN: What do you think more broadly - or do you believe that the U.S. asylum laws more broadly need to change?
KRIKORIAN: Absolutely. There's no question that it's too easy to use asylum as a way of getting illegally into the United States. And probably, the most important first change would need to be - and this is statutory; this is something Congress has to do - is raise the standards for the first cut - to make the first cut for asylum. It's called a credible fear interview. And the point is - you know, is your case even plausible? Now almost everybody gets approved. That can't continue because there is - it is unsustainable.
MARTIN: Do you believe that's the direction that the president wants to move in?
KRIKORIAN: I think so, clearly. I mean, there - but there's limit to what he can do as opposed to what Congress needs to do. One of the things that I think we're going to see a change - that we really do need to see a change is ICE changing its priorities, at least for now, so that what they do is they prioritize the return of failed asylum-seekers.
Now if you go through the process, you're turned down for asylum, there's really no consequences. Until people in Central America see failed asylum-seekers in large numbers being returned, they're just going to keep coming.
MARTIN: Conservative immigration activist Mark Krikorian - he is executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies.
Thanks so much.
KRIKORIAN: Thank you.

"Tariffs Hit Appliance Shoppers, Manufacturers In Different Ways",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711001915/tariffs-complex-ripple-effects-hit-appliance-shoppers-and-makers,"Enlarge this image Overall, prices of major appliances tracked by the consumer price index are starting to tick down month-to-month. But they are still higher than they were last year. Washing machines, dryers and other appliances are seen for sale at a Lowe's home improvement store in Washington, D.C., in 2018. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Overall, prices of major appliances tracked by the consumer price index are starting to tick down month-to-month. But they are still higher than they were last year. Washing machines, dryers and other appliances are seen for sale at a Lowe's home improvement store in Washington, D.C., in 2018.
Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images It was a daunting task. Amid a major renovation, Jani Mussetter needed a lot of appliances: a washer, dryer, refrigerator, freezer, dishwasher and stove. As she visited showrooms in January, a stressful thing kept coming up: warnings of a price increase on Feb. 1.
For Mussetter, who was shopping for higher-end appliances, that potentially meant paying hundreds of dollars more. And why? ""They said, because of all the tariffs,"" the San Francisco resident says.
Tariffs and the trade war have been in the news for more than a year , since President Trump began imposing higher taxes on various imported products and materials.
Business Despite Trump's Promises, The Trade Deficit Is Only Getting Wider For regular American shoppers, major household appliances perfectly illustrate the complicated reality of the trade dispute. One tariff was a boon to some domestic manufacturers. But other tariffs hiked costs for the entire industry worldwide. Prices on appliances are now slowly recovering from their biggest increase in about five years.
Whirlpool's gamble
Whirlpool, a leading American appliance-maker, is at the heart of the issue. Its prices had barely changed for many years, says G.research housing analyst Alvaro Lacayo. Then, in 2018, he says, ""you saw a big tick upward.""
At first, higher prices were welcome news for Whirlpool. They reflected the company's victory over its two main foreign competitors, South Korea's LG and Samsung.
Whirlpool — which also own Maytag, Jenn-Air and other brands — had spent years arguing that LG and Samsung had been ""dumping appliances into the U.S. market at below cost, rendering competition irrational,"" as Lacayo put it.
In January 2018, President Trump agreed with Whirlpool. He set a new tariff, or tax, on imported washing machines, starting at 20 percent . Selling washers to Americans became more expensive for foreign companies. And domestic manufacturers like Whirlpool could finally raise prices.
Business What's In Your Shopping Cart? A Battleground For Global Trade But then, Trump imposed more tariffs, on metals including aluminum and steel . Steel, in particular, is critical to building almost any appliance.
Suddenly, appliance-makers everywhere, including Whirlpool, began complaining about the rising cost of raw materials. They had little choice but to start raising their own prices.
""Global steel costs have risen substantially and, particularly in the U.S., they have reached unexplainable levels,"" Whirlpool CEO Marc Bitzer said during an analyst call in July 2018 .
What happens next
Steve Sheinkopf owns Yale Appliance & Lighting in the Boston area, and he's a third-generation owner. ""We have been here for almost 100 years now; it's hard to believe,"" he says.
Many brands Sheinkopf works with — like Wisconsin-based Sub-Zero and Wolf or Germany's Thermador — regularly inch up their prices, he says, but the increases in the past year have been bigger than most.
Sheinkopf predicts that appliance prices have probably stabilized at this point, at least for a while. But for shoppers who chase sales and specials, he says, promotions haven't been as good as they used to be three to four years ago.
Overall, prices of major appliances tracked by the consumer price index are starting to tick down month-to-month. But they are still higher than they were last year.
Business From Mills To Manufacturers, Steel Tariffs Produce Winners And Losers ""On certain products, you could be looking at a 14 to 16 percent increase from last year to this year,"" Sheinkopf says. ""When you talk about [washing] machines that people want to buy, front-loaders, I think you're looking at $200 to $400 difference versus last year.""
Many companies stretched some of the price increases into early 2019, still citing high costs of raw materials as well as changes in the currency market and labor costs. That's what Mussetter experienced as she rushed to buy appliances for her remodel before Feb. 1.
""I'd be really bummed if I was walking in today,"" she says with a laugh. Mussetter did manage to buy all her appliances ahead of the price jump. Later, she learned this saved her $1,250.
And one other thing happened last year, Whirlpool's Korean competitors, LG and Samsung, fast-tracked new manufacturing plants — in America. It's great news for American jobs. But for Whirlpool?
""I think this is the biggest challenge they'll ever have,"" Sheinkopf says.

Defining What's Excessive In Police Property Seizures Remains Tricky,www.npr.org,"Sonia Sotomayor, Supreme Court Justice",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/710456736/defining-whats-excessive-in-police-property-seizures-remains-tricky,"Enlarge this image Institute for Justice lawyer Wesley Hottot in his Seattle office.

toggle caption Martin Kaste/NPR Institute for Justice lawyer Wesley Hottot in his Seattle office. On the wall is a framed illustration of him arguing Timbs v. Indiana at the Supreme Court last fall.
Martin Kaste/NPR Tyson Timbs won his Supreme Court case in February, but he still doesn't have his Land Rover.
""I want my truck back. I've always wanted it back,"" says Timbs, whose Land Rover was seized by police in Indiana. They took it after he was arrested for selling a small amount of heroin to undercover cops. He served a period of house arrest and probation for the drug crime — punishments he accepted.
But Timbs never accepted that police were entitled to his $42,000 vehicle, which he'd bought with proceeds from an insurance settlement.
""I thought it was kind of ridiculous that they could take my vehicle so easily,"" he says.
And yet this kind of confiscation is common. Called ""civil asset forfeiture,"" it was developed as a law enforcement tactic in the drug war of the 1980s. Authorities use the lower standard of proof of civil law to take property — usually cars or cash — based on the suspicion it's associated with crime. In Timbs' case, police suspected he'd used the Land Rover to transport heroin. Since the tactic was developed, billions of dollars in assets have been seized this way.
Policing for profit
The technique attracts the ire of activists on the left and right, and occasionally it bursts into public view after especially egregious seizures .
Law Supreme Court Limits Civil Asset Forfeiture, Rules Excessive Fines Apply To States National D.C.'s Aggressive Confiscation Of Illegal Guns Leaves Residents Feeling Targeted One of the most visible opponents of civil asset forfeiture is a libertarian-leaning nonprofit called the Institute for Justice. It has argued for years that the billions of dollars in forfeited property amounts to a system of ""Policing for Profit."" They took on Timbs' case, arguing that the seizure of the truck constituted an ""excessive fine,"" in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
If we look at these forfeitures that are occurring today, many of them seem grossly disproportionate to the crimes being charged.
Sonia Sotomayor, Supreme Court Justice
During arguments last October, the justices seemed to agree that something is out of whack with forfeitures.
""If we look at these forfeitures that are occurring today,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, ""many of them seem grossly disproportionate to the crimes being charged.""
In February, the court ruled unanimously in Timbs' favor. But the victory was a narrow one.
What constitutes an ""excessive fine?""
""It's a landmark ruling because it made clear that the states have to comply with the excessive fines clause"" of the Bill of Rights, says Wesley Hottot, the Institute for Justice lawyer who argued the case. But what's still undetermined is what constitutes an ""excessive fine.""
[T]here's no meat on the bones! And the meat will be when the Supreme Court defines what 'excessive' is. We're just not there yet.
Lisa Soronen, State and Local Legal Center
""I do think it will result in a case-by-case development of where the line is,"" Hottot says. ""How much property can the government take from a person in connection with a crime? Can they take your car? Maybe. Can they take your cash? Maybe. ... We don't know the answers to those important questions yet.""
Lisa Soronen is executive director of the State and Local Legal Center, which took Indiana's side in the case. She also believes the Timbs case is just the beginning of a longer process — she says it's a legal ""skeleton.""
""But there's no meat on the bones! And the meat will be when the Supreme Court defines what 'excessive' is,"" Soronen says. ""We're just not there yet.""
Others think Timbs may have a quicker effect. In Georgia, a lawyer named Matt Cavedon says it strengthened his hand when he challenged the county's seizure of his client's moped. Police took it when his client was caught riding it while in possession of a couple of grams of meth.
""This was actually his main mode of transportation,"" Cavedon says.
Cavedon was negotiating with the prosecutor for the return of the moped around the time the Timbs case was decided. ""Being able to bring in a part of the Bill of Rights, and say that prohibited this seizure — that mattered a lot,"" he says.
Hall County Assistant District Attorney Wanda Vance denies the Timbs case made a difference. She says she gave the moped back mostly because it simply wasn't worth her time.
""I personally had spent as a prosecutor days working on this one asset forfeiture,"" Vance says. ""So it just got to be to where we made kind of the decision that it just wasn't in the interest of justice anymore for us to continue.""
Abandoning property to the state
That's an important factor. When someone contests a civil asset forfeiture, it costs time and money, for the prosecution, but also for the property owner. Because it's a civil case, no one is entitled to free legal representation, so challenging a forfeiture can quickly cost more in lawyer fees than the property is worth. In the moped case, Cavedon took the case pro bono, because he's an alumnus of the Institute for Justice's campaign against civil asset forfeiture.
That financial barrier means people often abandon their property to the state, rather than challenge a forfeiture. And, says Seattle attorney Hottot, that slows down the process of letting the courts determine what the protection against ""excessive fines"" really means.
""It's hard for the law to develop in a way that favors property owners when the amount in controversy is so much less than what it costs to litigate,"" Hottot says. ""The more societally efficient remedy here is for lawmakers to fix this.""
A few legislatures have acted. New Mexico eliminated civil asset forfeiture , requiring the state to get a criminal conviction before claiming property.
In Minnesota, legislators of both parties are pushing for restrictions on what the state terms ""administrative asset forfeiture,"" and they say their effort got ""moral support"" from the Supreme Court's unanimous Timbs ruling.
A needed tool in fighting crime
Law enforcement groups are worried about the shifting political climate on this issue.
""Our goal is to put a pause"" on this legislation, says Dakota County Sheriff Tim Leslie. He says there's a mushrooming meth trade in his part of Minnesota, and he needs asset forfeiture to disrupt the crime networks by seizing property, even when the culprits can't be found for prosecution.
""Why are we moving toward less tools in the toolbox?"" he asks. At the same time, he acknowledges the political pressure created by high-profile seizure cases such as Timbs.
""Those outrageous examples, we have to face those,"" he says. ""But we just don't want the pendulum to swing too far. We want to still have some tools for the outrageous things that we see going on"" in drug trafficking networks."

It was a big comeback after last year’s tournament, when the University of Virginia team lost to University of Maryland, Baltimore County in an early round – the first time a No. 16 had ever beat a No. 1 seed team.
As the overtime clock hit 0:00, Virginia player De’Andre Hunter – who scored a career-high 27 points – threw the basketball into the air in celebration. Confetti rained down, then the winning team cut down the basketball net, fulfilling an NCAA championship tradition .
The road to this moment was rocky for both teams. Virginia had close calls against Purdue and Auburn, and Texas Tech made it to the playoffs after losing their first conference tournament game.
But both teams showed up in full force on Monday night. So did their fans. Notable alumni from both schools came out to support their teams, including NFL quarterback and Texas Tech University alumni Patrick Mahomes, and University of Virginia-grad Katie Couric, AP reported .
At one point, a fan threw a tortilla – a Texas Tech school tradition – that landed on the elevated court, causing play to stop temporarily.

It was an evening of a few other “firsts.” Both teams made their NCAA championship debuts, and the University of Virginia won it’s first-ever national title at the tournament. The last time the NCAA had a first-time champion was thirteen years ago when the University of Florida bested UCLA in 2006.
And a block from Virginia sent the championship game into overtime for the first time since the University of Kansas beat the University of Memphis in 2008, according to NCAA.com .
The teams also matched a previous record – 21 combined 3-pointers in a championship game, The Associated Press reported .
At the end of the night, the NCAA announced the Final Four’s all-tournament team; three spots went to Virginia players – De’Andre Hunter, Ty Jerome and Kyle Guy, who was voted ‘Most Outstanding Player’ after scoring 24 points in the title game.

Trump Relies On Record Number Of Acting Positions,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711094554/an-acting-government-for-the-trump-administration,"Enlarge this image Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen shakes hands with President Trump in El Centro, Calif., on April 5 after he arrived to visit the border wall between the United States and Mexico.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation may have come as a surprise, but it's part of a pattern for the Trump administration. Replacing Cabinet secretaries has become a feature, not a bug, of this White House.
And it means that after Nielsen leaves her post later this week, three of the president's Cabinet members will be serving in an acting capacity.
Kevin McAleenan was named acting secretary of homeland security to replace Nielsen. Patrick Shanahan has been acting defense secretary since Jan. 1. And David Bernhardt has been acting interior secretary since Jan. 2, though he has been nominated to become the permanent interior secretary.
Trump sees an advantage in their status.
""I like 'acting' because I can move so quickly,"" he told CBS' Face The Nation in February, adding, ""It gives me more flexibility.""
Politics Kirstjen Nielsen Leaving Homeland Security Post As Border Crossings Surge The lack of permanence at the top of these departments means ""we don't have established leaders in really important places in our government,"" says Max Stier , CEO of the Partnership for Public Service.
Stier compares the acting directors to substitute teachers.
""They might be amazing educators or amazing leaders in their own right,"" Stier says, ""but they're not set out for success. They're not going to be perceived as having complete and full authority by those that are around them.""
And it's a crucial issue, he says, because ""these are jobs that are fundamental to keeping us all safe.""

Nielsen's departure means a total of 15 of Trump's Cabinet-level appointees have left in the first three years of the Trump administration , according to Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. (That includes White House chief of staff and ambassador to the U.N., two positions that are not considered Cabinet-level jobs by every administration.)
That compares with seven such departures in the first three years of the Obama administration and four for President George W. Bush.
Trump will be on his third secretary of homeland security in that period, which Tenpas says is ""record breaking.""
She says the high turnover in the Cabinet and among White House staff is ""off the charts"" and undermines the president's efforts to fulfill his campaign promises.
Tenpas says it's also surprising, given Trump's business background.
""In the private sector, corporations are all about how to retain their best people,"" she says. ""You would think President Trump would have a proclivity"" for such stability.
The reliance on acting officials is especially acute at the Department of Homeland Security, which lacks a permanent deputy secretary, as well as permanent heads of key agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
It also amounts to an end-around of the Senate, which under the U.S. Constitution has a role to advise and consent to the president's appointments.
""It's not only the Senate that's voting on them. In some very real way, it's also a public vetting that's occurring when the Senate is performing this function,"" says Stier.
To have so many people in acting positions, he says, puts off that public review and vetting."

The Trump administration has canceled an agreement that would have allowed Cuban baseball players in the U.S. without having to defect first. Officials say the agreement was illegal.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The Trump administration is striking out Major League Baseball, at least when it comes to players from Cuba. The White House is canceling a historic agreement that was signed just four months ago. It would have allowed Cuban players to join big league teams in the U.S. directly. They would no longer have to defect off the island before signing a baseball contract. Here's more from NPR's Carrie Kahn.
CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: The deal announced in December allowed Major League Baseball to sign players directly from Cuba's Baseball Federation. The Trump administration, however, called that deal foul, saying the Cuban Federation is an arm of the communist regime and, therefore, off-limits to do business with a U.S. company. According to a senior Trump administration official, the Obama-era negotiated deal was tantamount to official human trafficking and allowed the Cuban government to use the players as pawns.
In a statement, MLB defended the deal, saying, we stand by the goal of the agreement, which is to end the human trafficking of baseball players from Cuba. For decades, Cuban stars have had to find a way off the island, mostly at the hands of human traffickers and smugglers, before landing a contract. That's how right fielder Yasiel Puig defected from Cuba.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JOE BUCK: Delivers to Puig, and he smashes another one - deep left center field. That is going, and that is gone. How do you like this guy?
KAHN: Fox Sports announcers touted the now Cincinnati Reds' two home runs last month in a spring season game against Cleveland. Puig's been playing in Major League Baseball since leaving Cuba in 2012, when he allegedly endured kidnapping by a Mexican cartel that rumored payments for years to middlemen, who smuggled him off the island.
Advocates for warmer relations with Cuba say Trump's cancellation of the MLB agreement will just encourage more of that same smuggling and human trafficking. James Williams of Engage Cuba - a group that advocates for closer ties with Cuba - says Trump canceled the landmark agreement without offering any alternative.
JAMES WILLIAMS: All it does is make it worse. And it's really just about politics, not trying to solve a real issue, which is human trafficking.
KAHN: Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida lobbied to end the agreement, arguing that the Cuban Baseball Federation is part of the Cuban government. The Obama administration had ruled it was independent. In a tweet, the Cuban Baseball Federation called the cancellation an attack with political motivations that will harm athletes, their families and the fans.

14 People Who Pleaded Guilty Face Prison Time In College Admissions Case,www.npr.org,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711314428/14-people-who-pleaded-guilty-face-prison-time-in-college-admissions-case,"Prosecutors are pushing for jail time for the 13 parents and one coach who have said they will plead guilty to using bribery and other forms of fraud as part of the college admissions scandal.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
So the actress Felicity Huffman, most famous for her role on ""Desperate Housewives,"" is among a group of 13 wealthy parents who have agreed to plead guilty to charges of fraud in the college admissions scandal. Prosecutors are pushing for prison time for what court filings call a nationwide conspiracy that involve cheating on college entrance exams and also falsifying athletic achievements to get students into elite universities. Now those parents and the athletic coach who aided their supposed fraud could potentially face jail time. NPR's Elissa Nadworny covers education. She joins us this morning. Hi, Elissa.
ELISSA NADWORNY, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.
GREENE: So what exactly does this mean for these parents who are pleading guilty here?
NADWORNY: Right. So more than a dozen parents and one college coach have agreed to plead guilty. They were charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud in connection with the scheme. So according to prosecutors, those charges can carry a punishment of up to 20 years.
GREENE: Wow.
NADWORNY: But if parents cooperate with prosecutors, they're likely to get a much lighter sentence. Felicity Huffman's plea agreement, prosecutors recommended a prison sentence of, quote, ""the low end of the sentencing range."" In other cases, they recommend 12 to 18 months behind bars.
GREENE: OK. But she could still be serving, like, a year in prison, potentially. I mean, is she saying anything about this yet?
NADWORNY: So she released a statement with an apology, saying she was, quote, ""ashamed,"" and has, quote, ""deep regret"" over what she's done. She also says her daughter knew nothing about her actions, and she apologized to students who, quote, ""work hard every day to get into college.""
GREENE: So prosecutors talked about - I mean, they've charged 50 people here. I mean, this is $25 million scam, they said. What about everyone else?
NADWORNY: Yeah. So we're still kind of waiting to see. You know, there are some folks who appear to be fighting the charges, like Lori Loughlin, the actress best known for ""Full House."" It's pretty amazing to kind of see the attention that this story has captured. So I mean, I've just been kind of rapt as an education reporter.
GREENE: I'm sure.
NADWORNY: (Laughter).
GREENE: I mean, do you think it's deserved, that kind of attention? Like, does this feel like something momentous that could really - I mean, it's definitely brought up a big conversation about class and about the idea of college, which in our country, we want to believe is, like, a fair process. Right?
NADWORNY: Yeah. Exactly. It's interesting because, you know, these schools, these highly selective schools, they just serve about 1 percent of all college students. So it's been really interesting to see kind of how this is such a small group of students, but it's really captured our kind of frustration with wealth and privilege and what that means in terms of college access.
GREENE: As we started reporting on this, I mean, everyone in higher education seemed to say, like, yeah, it's a problem - we all knew that it was a problem for so long, and nothing has really changed the system, changed the culture. Could this be the moment? Or is there a feeling in the field of education that, I mean, it's just so entrenched that it's going to be very hard to change the system?
NADWORNY: Well, I have seen a lot of conversations about kind of how do we get low-income students to kind of get into college? It's certainly renewed a conversation around legacy admissions, which is the system that gives extra points to students whose parents or siblings already attended a specific school. And there's also a renewed interest in schools that don't require the college entrance exams like the ACT or the SAT, though the College Board, the company behind the SAT, says using an outside assessment actually makes it harder to pull off fraud.
But even this idea of college as nonprofit status, like, should they have this if they're not really an open-access organization or serving the greater public? So these are kind of the things that I'm keeping an eye on, and we'll see what happens.
GREENE: All right. Quite a story to follow. NPR education reporter Elissa Nadworny. Thanks so much.
NADWORNY: Thanks.

"After The Genocide, Author Witnessed How Rwandans Defined Forgiveness",www.npr.org,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711314421/after-the-genocide-author-witnessed-how-rwandans-defined-forgiveness,"How have Rwandans navigated forgiveness in the 25 years since the genocide in that country? Rachel Martin talks to journalist and author Philip Gourevitch, who has been documenting that process.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
It happened 25 years ago - up to 800,000 people in Rwanda killed - mostly from the minority Tutsi community, all of that over the course of just a hundred days. Today the hundreds of thousands of people who carried out those killings live among their victims. Journalist and author Philip Gourevitch has witnessed the unique way Rwandans have defined and navigated forgiveness after the massacre. And for the majority of Rwandans who are too young to remember what happened, he says the genocide often shaped their lives in similar ways.
PHILIP GOUREVITCH: It's obviously a huge shadow over them. But the difference of not having direct memory changes the relationships. But you do feel that the weight of it on the young is quite differently distributed, that they feel it differently. But obviously, if you grew up an orphan or a child of rape or in a family where, instead of 50 people, there are five and they are deeply traumatized and impoverished - or you grew up in a family where you were carrying food to your father every day in prison and being looked at in the community as that boy, the child of a killer.
And then you both wind up, those two kids, let's say, in college from the same place. They recognize each other, and they find a way of relating to each other. That's pretty remarkable. And it happens on a regular basis. It's something that people talk about with a kind of sense of amazement at the same time as they talk about it with a shrug, as if it were normal. And I'm not sure which one gets them through better.
MARTIN: In order to navigate the aftermath of the genocide, the Rwandan government set up this nationwide reconciliation process. Can you describe how it worked?
GOUREVITCH: Essentially, there was a big question. Do you have trials? Do you hold everybody accountable or attempt to? Or do you essentially say - we're going to say this was the political order, and we're going to try and hold the people at the top accountable? And the rest, as we change the political system, we're not afraid of them.
And in Rwanda, there was the feeling - but no. There was a lot of agency in the local level. And the experience of the genocide was extremely localized. People were killed by neighbors. It was intimate. They knew each other. And to simply ignore that wouldn't work.
So they set up a system of community courts - without lawyers - to sort of repurpose a system that really had only been used for small claims mitigation in traditional Rwanda, called gacaca, and have open, communal - what we might call a town hall - format for trials. And then the idea was to hold people accountable and have a system of punishment. And this system banked very heavily on encouraging confession and rewarding it. But the confessions were supposed to be also verified by the community.
MARTIN: And what was the specific role of the victims or their surviving family members? They had to be there. And then, after verifying a certain account, were they expected to then make a public state of forgiveness or reconciliation?
GOUREVITCH: They weren't necessarily in a position to verify. Many of them knew that so-and-so was always said to have killed their family members. But they weren't direct witnesses because, by virtue of their survival, that usually meant that they were either somewhere else or well-hidden or had escaped or...
MARTIN: Not present, yeah.
GOUREVITCH: Yes. So in many cases, it's the testimony of other members of the community that would be specific and then these confessions, which were very, very graphic. And so the motto of the gacaca courts was, truth heals.
But as we know, truth can also be really traumatizing and, in this case, retraumatizing because, to go from the idea that - that person is the killer of my family, and I want him to answer for it - to then hearing him describe in quite gory detail and often quite coarsely how he'd gone about killing, let's say, your family members and, at that moment, be asked to accept and forgive him, that's an awful lot to ask at that moment.
But what's interesting to me, too, is - what does forgiveness mean? I mean, to some extent, when I went and I heard the word forgiveness, I thought it sort of meant you'd restore whatever the relationship was before.
MARTIN: Yeah.
GOUREVITCH: And they would say, no, that involves trust. That's a whole different thing. Forgiveness doesn't require trust. Forgiveness simply means letting go of the idea of getting even, forgoing the idea of revenge. Right? Now, even that's a big ask. But it means accepting coexistence.
MARTIN: Right. I mean, is there any way to determine if the gacaca reconciliation process was the reason why Rwanda was able to move forward? I mean, it was an exceptional, nationwide reckoning.
GOUREVITCH: There's never been as comprehensive a reckoning with such communal violence or mass atrocity. I think Rwandans at the time found it very tough. It created a lot of tension because it was an ongoing, multi-year confrontation with the past in the communities. I think in the aftermath of it, you find that the genocide is no longer an unaddressed, looming problem that, in a sense, is both behind and before them - that it was something that had to be done in order for whatever one might call reconciliation.
And one of the things that I often heard people say - you'd ask them how it was going. And they'd start to say, well, for me, it's really very tough still. You know, I'm not at all at ease with this or that or the other thing. But then they would say, even as they complained about much of what was being asked of them by having to live together, they would say - but you know, in general - in society, things are much better. I started to hear this, especially towards the end of gacaca and in the years since.
I took that as a very interesting thing - saying, well, you know, my pains are not gone; my struggles are not over. But the general balance is good. And that means that they felt like something had been gained even if they themselves were not fully at peace - in other words, that the societal peace had been served maybe better than any given individual peace.
MARTIN: It's a starting point.
GOUREVITCH: Yeah. Yeah, I think so - because one wants not to have to accept certain things. It feels like something should be unforgivable. And yet, confronted with that alternative, you can end up in a situation where, you know, just the urge for punitive resolution makes it impossible to continue.
MARTIN: Philip Gourevitch, thank you so much for talking with us.
GOUREVITCH: Thank you.
