"Thailand tourism authority clarifies remarks from Phuket airport chief, says tourists won't face death penalty over photos with low-flying planes",www.foxnews.com,Alexandra Deabler,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/thailand-tourism-authority-clarifies-remarks-from-phuket-airport-chief-says-tourists-wont-face-death-penalty-over-photos-with-low-flying-planes,"Airport Chief Wichit Kaeothaithiam told the Post that the ""maximum penalty"" for tourists who distract pilots near the Phuket International Airport was the ""death sentence,"" but the tourism authority now says that such punishment is reserved only for actions that are deliberately intended to impede the plane or the captains&apos; performance, and not simply the act of posing for selfies on a secured section of Mai Khao beach. ""There is no such penalty for taking such selfies with landing planes in Phuket. We understand that the airport authorities are looking at ways to introduce a safety zone for tourists to take photos with the landing planes,"" a representative for the Tourism Authority of Thailand confirmed in a statement to Fox News.
The authority went on to say that Kaeothaithiam was referring to crimes such as ""flying drones or shining flashlights or laser lights at planes,"" which are subject to harsher punishments under the country&apos;s Air Navigation Act.
The portion of the beach near the airport’s runway has become very popular on social media, and is sometimes known as “Unseen Phuket,” as tourists flock to the section to pose with the landing planes.
According to the Bangkok Post , authorities have become more concerned as the beach has grown in popularity and will be developing a new safety zone near the runway that will ban people from entering sometime soon.
""People and tourists will not be allowed to enter this area to take photos,"" Kaeothaithiam said.
Following the implementation of the off-limits safety area, violators will reportedly face harsh punishments, such as a fine of 40,000 baht ($1,253) or a jail sentence of up to 20 years, The Sun reported.
But Mai Khao beach isn&apos;t the only airport-adjacent spot with a selfie problem. Tourists looking to snag photos with low-flying aircraft have been a problem at another popular beach in the Caribbean, as well.
Maho Beach, on the island of Saint Martin, has seen tourists suffer deaths after trying to get an up-close plane pic. A 57-year-old woman vacationing in Saint Martin was killed after a blast from a nearby jet knocked her to the ground. Officials say the woman had been holding onto a fence that separates the beach from the airport when winds generated by the jet’s engines blasted her back.

“It didn’t touch my feet but I felt so much air from the plane and I lost my balance. It was so much fun and exciting but it was only after I realized how dangerous it was,” Nos said to SWNS.

Sally Selby, 45, was arrested on theft charges. (Cumberland County Sheriff's Office) A woman in Tennessee just wanted a cup of coffee from Waffle House — so she stole an electric shopping scooter to make the slow ride for a cup of joe, police said. Sally Selby, 45, was arrested and charged with theft Friday after police pulled her over on the highway in Crossville for taking the electric scooter on a joy ride, WTVF reported. Selby was spotted on surveillance video entering a Walmart about 4:15 a.m., getting into the scooter and riding it around the store as she shopped.

Rep. Sean Duffy: Green New Deal supporters don’t care about the climate – they want control over your life,www.foxnews.com,Rep. Sean Duffy,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rep-sean-duffy-green-new-deal-supporters-dont-care-about-the-climate-they-want-control-over-your-life,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks at the annual National Action Network convention Thanks to policies laid out by President Trump and Republicans in Congress , the American economy is booming. We reformed the tax code so that families can keep more of their own hard-earned money, and instituted smart regulations so that businesses have the right guardrails to grow and hire more workers.
As a result, wages are up, and unemployment is down. Right now, in fact, there are a million more job openings in the United States than there are unemployed Americans.
The American Dream is back within reach of millions of families. My wife, Rachel, and I have eight children, and we have never been so excited for their future.
But we’re not getting tired of all this winning. We’re just getting started.
Alarmingly, leftist ideologues in the Democratic Party want to stop America’s momentum in its tracks. For decades, socialists in America have rejected the notion that America is the land of freedom, opportunity, and upward mobility.
Instead, they view our way of life as the problem.
Take their support for the so-called “Green New Deal.” Supporters of the Green New Deal desire to rig the game in their favor by radically overhauling our economy, which would make it harder for families to save money and live the American Dream. They say this is all in the name of addressing climate change.
The plan’s “Frequently Asked Questions” document lays out their goals:
“Yes, we are calling for a full transition off fossil fuels and zero greenhouse gases. Anyone who has read the resolution sees that we spell this out through a plan that calls for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from every sector of the economy. Simply banning fossil fuels immediately won’t build the new economy to replace it – this is the plan to build that new economy and spells out how to do it technically.
We do this through a huge mobilization to create a renewable energy economy as fast as possible. We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.”
So, they want to ban fossil fuels, get rid of all cows in America, take away your freedom to travel by air, and require your home, church, place of work, children’s school – everywhere – to be “retro-fitted” to eliminate carbon emissions.
And what happens if we don’t? According to the Green New Deal’s author, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, “The world is going to end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.”
Because she claims the world is going to end, she argues that her critics are wrong to ask, “how are we gonna pay for it?”
Well, Ocasio-Cortez, rich liberals in places like San Francisco or New York may be able to afford the massive new set of regulations that the Green New Deal requires, but hardworking families in northern Wisconsin – and in communities around America – will not be able to afford these radical ideas.
The American Action Forum, a non-partisan think tank, has calculated that the Green New Deal will cost up to $93 trillion in only the first 10 years.
Despite the Green New Deal’s claim that this plan will help the poor, it is the poorest Americans who will suffer the most from this plan.
Poor and working-class Americans would face higher energy costs, higher food costs, and higher housing costs.
On two occasions, I have raised awareness of the plan’s damaging consequences in legislative discussion in the House Financial Services Committee. By inserting language of the Green New Deal into housing legislation, I gave Democrats, including several of the Green New Deal’s original supporters, the opportunity to vote in support of their plan to overhaul our economy.
Any reasonable person would think they would vote for their own proposal, right?
If the world were truly going to end in 12 years, they would have a sense of urgency and immediately vote for it any chance they could. They would also change the way they live before asking Americans to change how they live. For instance, why does Sen. Bernie Sanders often take private jets? Why does Rep. Ocasio-Cortez not take the train to Washington from New York? Why didn’t she take the subway during her campaign, which was less than a football field away from her office?
Their actions and their votes show that this radical economic upheaval is not about saving the world’s climate.
Supporters of the Green New Deal in the House voted against their own proposal twice. Every single Democrat on the Committee voted against the plan. And the Green New Deal’s author, Ocasio-Cortez, skipped the vote entirely.
In the Senate, all six Senators vying for the Democrat nomination for president have signed their names to the plan. However, those same six Senators ducked a vote on the Green New Deal. That’s right, even avowed socialist Bernie Sanders did not vote in favor of it.

They have chosen to vote against or vote present for their own proposal they say we need so dearly because these socialists don’t want you to see their full hand too quickly. Ultimately, they want to control the way you live, control what you eat, where you live, and how you travel. They want to institute a socialist ideology that the far-left has been trying to force upon the American people for over a century.
We must stand against radical ideas like the Green New Deal, and continue to work to find commonsense solutions that expand freedom and opportunity for the American people. It is my hope that these far-left Democrats will join us in the effort to help make a more prosperous America for the next generation – and yes, one that will live and work in our nation more than 12 years from now.

Bill Bennett jokes maybe Sanders’ tax returns reveal 'he's got $32T in there' to cover the Medicare for All plan,www.foxnews.com,Talia Kaplan,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bill-bennett-bernie-sanders-tax-returns-medicare-for-all,"“As Ronald Reagan would say about Bernie Sanders view ‘there you go again,’ more movement to the left among the leaders of this Democrat party, runners for the presidential nomination,” said Bennett, a Fox News contributor, on “ America’s Newsroom ” Wednesday. “Look, it’s a $32 trillion dollar bill at least. I don’t know if you made the connection but Bernie Sanders has not released his tax returns, maybe he’s got $32 trillion in there that can cover this but I kind of doubt it,” joked Bennett.
Sen. Sanders, I-Vt., who is expected to release his tax returns on Monday, is one of the most outspoken lawmakers in support of the policy and used “Medicare for All” as part of his platform in his 2016 presidential campaign. He is expected to use the updated version of the proposal for his 2020 run, shaking up the election by reopening the debate over his call to eliminate private health insurance.
The plan’s astronomical price tag is under fire from President Donald Trump and Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who slammed it as a far-left social experiment. On Tuesday McConnell, R-Ky., wrote on Twitter, “Democrats’ “Medicare for None” would slap a $32 trillion tab on Americans, and that’s just a rough estimate for the first decade. And competing private insurance policies -- like the ones that 180 million Americans currently use -- would be banned outright.”
Four of Sanders&apos; fellow senators and rivals for the Democratic nomination, including Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., are set to sign on to the updated single-payer health care proposal.
“They’ll all follow him. He’s the Pied Piper and they will follow him and many of them have endorsed this idea,” said Bennett.
Video Some candidates who back the plan tout it as one of several ways to achieve more affordable coverage and lower the number of uninsured.
“This idea has initial approval from the public, about 50% when they first hear about it. When they hear that they will lose their individual insurance plan it goes down in the 30s, when they hear what it will cost it goes down in the 20s,” said Bennett. “This is a nonstarter, this is something Donald Trump can use to great advantage in a campaign.”
Those candidates who don&apos;t support “Medicare for All” are instead focusing on safeguarding popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as the one that protects coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.

Democrats were loaded for bear, but Barr warded off their jabs, explaining the process by which the report is being reviewed and making some news along the way.
Here are the major takeaways.

BERNIE INTRODUCES NEW ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ PLAN
AP: “Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont unveiled a new version of his ‘Medicare for All’ plan on Wednesday, shaking up the 2020 presidential race by reopening the debate over his call to eliminate private health insurance. ‘It is not a radical idea to say that in the United States, every American who goes to a doctor should be able to afford the prescription drug he or she needs,’ Sanders said. ‘Health care is a human right, not a privilege.’ Four of Sanders’ fellow senators and rivals for the Democratic nomination are set to sign onto the updated single-payer health care proposal. The bill’s reintroduction promises to shine a light on Democratic presidential candidates’ disparate visions for the long term future of American health care. Under fire from President Donald Trump and Republicans for the astronomical price tag of Medicare for All, some candidates who support the plan tout it as one of several ways to achieve more affordable coverage and lower the number of uninsured people.”
He’ll also release his tax returns by Monday - NYT: “Senator Bernie Sanders, whose $18 million fund-raising haul has solidified his status as a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said Tuesday that he would release 10 years of tax returns by Tax Day on Monday and acknowledged that he has joined the ranks of the millionaires he has denounced for years. ‘April 15 is coming,’ Mr. Sanders, whose refusal to release his full past returns has become an issue in the campaign, said in an interview in his office. ‘We wanted to release 10 years of tax returns. April 15, 2019, will be the 10th year, so I think you will see them.’ Told that he was being compared to President Trump, who has refused to release his tax returns, Mr. Sanders got more specific: ‘On the day in the very immediate future, certainly before April 15, we release ours, I hope that Donald Trump will do exactly the same.’”

THE RULEBOOK: HOLD THE PURSE

TIME OUT: ‘HIS ACCIDENCY’
Vanity Fair: “In 1868, President Andrew Johnson found himself impeached and on trial before the U.S. Senate. Over the course of his term, he had essentially declared war on his own government, vetoing an outrageous 29 bills, firing officials without Senate permission, and pardoning old pals. Congress fought back: 15 vetoes were overridden, and after a nearly three-month trial Abe Lincoln ’s successor barely escaped conviction. ‘The question of whether a president could govern while being on trial was a hot topic,’ writes Jared Cohen in Accidental Presidents: Eight Men Who Changed America , out this month from Simon & Schuster. ‘Johnson clearly thought he could … The book is also a reminder that, when it came to succession, America’s founders basically winged it. ‘If you think about how much we leave to chance, the fact that only Andrew Johnson was a disaster is really quite the miracle,’ Cohen says.”

TEAM TRUMP CONSIDERS REVISING FAMILY SEPARATION PLAN
WaPo: “The Trump administration is considering a revised version of its family separation tactic to cope with an influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border that would force parents to choose whether to remain detained as a family or agree to a separation to keep their children out of custody, according to administration officials. The administration weighed the new policy as President Trump insisted that he has no plans to separate families, falsely claimed that President Barack Obama carried out the same plan and maintained that his decision to halt the practice last year was the reason so many Central Americans have been coming to the United States. ‘We’re not looking to do that now,’ the president told reporters in the Oval Office, when asked to respond to reports that the White House is planning to separate families again. ‘But it brings a lot more people to the border when you don’t do it.’”
Pentagon announces $1 billion contracts for border wall - Time: “The Pentagon announced two military contracts Tuesday worth $976 million to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, marking the first step toward President Donald Trump’s long-promised goal since he declared a national emergency nearly two months ago. The Army Corps of Engineers awarded a $789 million contract to the Galveston, Texas-based company, SLSCO Ltd., for ‘border replacement wall construction’ in Santa Teresa, N. M., near El Paso, Texas. Barnard Construction Co. Inc., of Bozeman, Mont., was awarded a contract worth $187 million for ‘design-bid-build construction project for primary pedestrian wall replacement’ in Yuma, Ariz. Both projects, announced on the Defense Department website, are slated for completion in fall 2020.”
Resignation of DHS acting deputy secretary continues shakeup - Fox News: “President Trump&apos;s high-level overhaul of the Department of Homeland Security continued on Tuesday, with the announcement that DHS&apos; acting deputy secretary is resigning amid a reported historic surge in illegal immigrants and asylum seekers at the border. Claire Grady was technically the next in line to replace Kirstjen Nielsen , who resigned Sunday. But Trump chose Kevin McAleenan , the head of Customs and Border Protection, as acting secretary. That meant Grady had to resign or be fired. Two officials with direct knowledge of the decision, speaking anonymously to The Associated Press, said Grady was pressed to quit. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Nielsen said Grady had offered her resignation, writing that ‘her sound leadership and effective oversight have impacted every DHS office and employee and made us stronger as a Department.’”
MCCONNELL IS READY FOR NEW BUDGET PLAN
AP: “Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said Tuesday it’s time to kick off bipartisan talks on a new budget pact to fund federal agencies over the next two years. The Kentucky Republican told reporters that he spoke with President Donald Trump last week and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday morning, and that both support trying to reach an agreement on a new spending pact for both the Pentagon and domestic programs. ‘We’ve agreed to put together, at the staff level, a group to begin discussing the possibility of reaching a two-year (spending) caps deal so we can move ahead hopefully with some kind of regular appropriations process,’ McConnell told reporters. A new funding agreement is needed to prevent the return of spending cuts under the remnants of a failed 2011 budget and debt agreement. Trump has only reluctantly signed spending bills during his two years in office…”
GILLIBRAND SAYS SHE WAS WRONG ON IMMIGRATION
Politico: “Democratic presidential hopeful Kirsten Gillibrand on Tuesday confronted some of her previous stances on immigration, saying they ‘didn&apos;t care’ about the needs of diverse Americans. ‘When I was a member of Congress from upstate New York, I was really focused on the priorities of my district,’ the New York senator said during a CNN town hall. ‘When I became senator of the entire state, I recognized that some of my views really did need to change.’ Before becoming a senator in 2009, Gillibrand represented a largely Republican district in the House and expressed ideas on immigration — from blocking certain benefits for undocumented immigrants to establishing English as an official language — that have come back to haunt her as she seeks the Democratic nomination in 2020. Those old stances especially corrode her platform as the antithesis of President Donald Trump…”
She was also confronted about relationship with Hillary - Fox News: “New York senator and 2020 candidate Kirsten Gillibrand was awkwardly confronted Tuesday about her relationship with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after suggesting that her husband Bill Clinton should have resigned from office. Back in November 2017 during the early stages of the #MeToo movement, Gillibrand told The New York Times that it would have been an ‘appropriate response’ for former President Clinton to resign over his affair with Monica Lewinsky . ‘Things have changed today, and I think under those circumstances there should be a very different reaction,’ Gillibrand said at the time. … Gillibrand, who succeeded Clinton in the Senate and was a big supporter of her 2016 campaign, was confronted by CNN anchor Erin Burnett about their relationship during a televised town hall on Tuesday night.”

AS IN ‘HE’S AWARE THAT HE’S EATING GLUTEN’
The Takeout: “Gluten avoidance is one of those things that people sometimes poke fun at, even though for people with celiac disease, or those who are extremely allergic to gluten, it can be deadly serious. But many people also try to avoid gluten for more minor health reasons. Vancouver-based Earls restaurant, a chain with 20 restaurants in the U.S., was apparently just trying to address those differences on its menu, noting that its tacos were available with ‘gluten aware tortillas.’ Conservative pundit Matt Walsh then asked on Twitter, ‘What the hell is a ‘gluten aware tortilla’’? … ‘Gluten aware’ kind of rankles in an overly PC way. Maybe one of those ‘This gluten-free product is prepared in the same kitchen as gluten products’ disclaimers?’ Too long? Still, we suspect that people with celiac disease would likely be asking those important questions regardless.”

"Warren releases tax returns showing million-dollar income, moments after pitching wealth tax",www.foxnews.com,Paul Steinhauser,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-releases-tax-returns,"The Democrat from Massachusetts used the release to once again highlight a bill she’s pushing that would mandate that the Internal Revenue Service publicly release the tax returns of the president, vice president, presidential candidates and federal officeholders. “I’ve put out eleven years of my tax returns because no one should ever have to guess who their elected officials are working for. Doing this should be law,” Warren said in a statement, in a likely jab at President Trump and possibly rival Bernie Sanders.
But the details of her high income also come as the candidate doubles down on calls to tax the rich. Warren’s campaign released the candidate’s returns minutes after the senator concluded a speech to a union crowd in the nation’s capital where she once again pushed for her proposal to tax ultra-wealthy Americans based on their assets.
“I’m in this fight for a wealth tax. A two percent tax on the 75 biggest fortunes in the country. Two percent. That’s all we’re asking,” the populist senator with a history of taking on Wall Street and big businesses highlighted as she addressed a gathering of the North America&apos;s Building Trades Unions.
“We could provide universal childcare for every working parent in America. Universal pre-K…. for every child and still have $2 trillion left over,” she explained.
The senator released her previous 10 years of tax returns last August.
Last month Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York became the first Democratic presidential contender to release tax returns.
Besides Sanders, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg are among those White House hopefuls who’ve yet to release their returns. But tax returns are not due to the IRS until next Monday, April 15.

“In other news, half the team got stuck on an elevator after the game last night,” Wingert tweeted. “No Brave was hurt in the making of this video.”
It was unclear how many Braves players were exactly stuck in the elevator. Some social media users were quick to point out that the chamber looked more like a “clown car” than an elevator car, due to the numerous players who emerged from it.
Atlanta won the road game, 7-1, over Colorado.

"Texas Senate votes to raise smoking age to 21, exempting active military members",www.foxnews.com,Danielle Wallace,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-senate-raises-smoking-age-21-exempts-military-members,"The bill’s sponsor Sen. Joan Huffman (R-Houston) amended her own legislation to exempt active military members after receiving pushback from some Republicans who argued the law denied young adults who enlist in the military the freedom to choose to use tobacco products, The Dallas Morning News reported. Active U.S. military or state military force members between the ages of 18 and 20 will be permitted to purchase tobacco products if they present valid military identification, according to the revised bill.
The amendment allowed Huffman to secure more than the 19 votes required in the 31-member body to approve the proposed legislation. The revised version of Bill 21 passed the state Senate 20-11 without debate and will be sent to the House for approval.
""I want to thank Sen. Huffman for passing this important legislation for the children of Texas. Senate Bill 21 will save lives and is an investment in Texas&apos; future,” Texas’ Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said in a statement. ""Increasing the age to purchase tobacco products in Texas to 21 will not only improve public health and save countless lives, it will save Texans billions of dollars in health care costs.""
Texas 21, a coalition of groups that supports raising the legal age for tobacco products to 21, opposed the military service member amendment to Bill 21.
“Texas 21 will be working with legislators to help them understand the importance of including the military in tobacco 21 legislation,” Claudia Rodas of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids told The Dallas Morning News. “Our goal is a tobacco 21 law that protects all young Texans, including those who are willing to die to protect our country.”
Huffman recognized the coalition’s concern but said the law would be impractical for military members who have to move across state lines. The state senator recognized the importance of the legislation to protect young Texans from developing deadly smoking habits.
""While I understand it&apos;s still an issue in the military, these individuals are often required to move across state lines,"" Huffman told WFAA , adding she wanted to avoid any confusion.
""Ninety-five percent, 95 percent of adult smokers, begin smoking before they turn 21,"" Huffman told WFAA. ""Even more astounding is that three-quarters of adult smokers tried their first cigarette before the age of 18.""

The judge overseeing the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor who fatally shot the unarmed Australian Ruszczyk Damond, is restricting media and public access. Thirty-three-year-old Noor goes on trial Monday in the July 2017 death of Ruszcyzyk Damond. Judge Kathryn Quaintance ruled Friday, March 29, 2019, that potentially graphic evidence would be seen only by the jury, not the public or media.

(AP Photo/Amy Forliti, File) MINNEAPOLIS – The Latest on the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged in the fatal shooting of an unarmed woman who had called 911 to report a possible crime (all times local): 11:35 a.m.
A defense attorney for a Minneapolis police officer who fatally shot an unarmed woman who had called 911 to report a possible crime near her home says the officer and his partner wouldn't have known they were responding to a report about a possible sexual assault.
Recordings of the two 911 calls Justine Ruszczyk Damond made to dispatchers shortly before she died in July 2017 were played Wednesday during Mohamed Noor's trial on murder and manslaughter charges. Damond's voice drew an emotional reaction from her family in court.
Defense attorney Tom Plunkett said the officers would not have heard the 911 calls before going to investigate. He said they were told by dispatch that there was a report of a woman screaming behind a building.
During the 911 calls, Damond said she could hear someone in the alley behind her home and thought it might be a sexual assault.

12:05 a.m.
Prosecutors may introduce body camera video as early as Wednesday in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed an unarmed woman.
Mohamed Noor faces murder and manslaughter charges in the July 2017 death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond. Noor shot her when she approached his squad car minutes after she called 911 to report a possible sexual assault in the alley behind her home.
The body camera footage doesn't capture the shooting because Noor and his partner hadn't activated their cameras. But it does capture the aftermath as officers tried to save Damond.
The judge in the case sought to keep the media and public from seeing the footage, but she reversed herself after media outlets filed a legal challenge. Trending in US"
Texas moves to become next state to protect free speech on college campuses,www.foxnews.com,Andrew O'Reilly,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-moves-to-become-next-state-to-protect-free-speech-on-college-campuses,"A day before President Trump signed his executive order last month that threatened colleges with the loss of federal research funding if they don’t protect students’ free speech rights, the Texas Senate passed a bill prohibiting public universities from rejecting appearances by controversial figures. The legislation, which passed unanimously in the state Senate, would require all Texas colleges and universities to come up with more uniform policies regarding free speech as well as dole out disciplinary measures for any student who interferes with free speech activities on campus and set up a system for addressing free speech infringement complaints.
""Colleges and universities should provide the opportunity for students to hear others&apos; points of view in a free and unrestrained manner,"" Texas state Sen. Joan Huffman R-Houston, said in a statement. ""Senate Bill 18 is a direct result of the Committee&apos;s process of hearings and research toward that goal. This bill was constructed in an objective, non-partisan manner and will be applied equally to all groups and points of view.""
The bill, which enjoys the support of Texas’ Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, has been referred to the Higher Education Committee in the Texas House, where it awaits a hearing.
Video The nationwide debate over the recent attacks on free speech on college campuses across the country has largely been driven by conservative activists and lawmakers, but both sides of the political divide have been affected by campus policies, or the lack thereof.
Three days after SB 18 passed through the state senate, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s presidential campaign was barred from handing out flyers on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. This follows a 2017 incident where Texas A&M University was threatened with a lawsuit for cancelling a rally featuring white nationalist Richard Spencer and another one that year when Texas Southern University halted a speech by conservative state Rep. Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, after disruptions by protestors.
Across the country, colleges and universities have been grappling with how to handle free speech issues in an extremely polarizing political environment. The University of California, Berkeley – a traditional hotbed of campus activism – has been thrust into the center of the debate amid violent protests and disruptions during appearances by right-wing speakers.
In February 2017, 150 leftist black-clad protesters rampaged through Berkeley’s campus, where they caused $100,000 worth of damage, beat students and forced the University of California to cancel a planned speech by right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.
Video Later that year, a group of around 100 hooded members of Antifa stormed what had been a largely peaceful rally for free speech in the town of Berkeley and attacked at least five people, including the leader of a politically conservative group that had canceled an event a day earlier in San Francisco to avoid potential violence.
“I can see this popping up more and more,” Roy Gutterman, the director of Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University, told Fox News . “It would be reasonable to see similar suits popping up with the events in Charlottesville.""
Gutterman was referring to the 2017 rally in opposition to the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee on the campus of the University of Virginia that turned violent as white supremacists and neo-Nazis clashed with counterprotestors. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed when James Alex Fields Jr. drove a 2010 Dodge Challenger into a crowd on a pedestrian mall.
Video So far, Kentucky, South Dakota, Tennessee, Colorado, Iowa, and Arkansas – all Republican-heavy states – have passed legislation similar to the one being discussed in Texas.
The unrest on college campuses has become a major concern for the current White House administration, with Trump frequently bringing it up in speeches.
Shortly before signing his executive order, the president brought Hayden Williams, a conservative activist who was attacked while working a recruitment table on campus in Berkeley, on stage during his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February.
“He took a punch for all of us,” Trump said of Williams . “And we could never allow that to happen. And here is, in closing with Hayden, here’s the good news. He’s going to be a wealthy young man.”
“If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they’ve got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people and old people to speak,” Trump said. “Free speech. If they don’t, it will be costly.”

Fulham soccer fan sues California DMV over ‘Come on You Whites’ vanity plate,www.foxnews.com,Lucia Suarez Sang,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/fulham-soccer-fan-sues-california-dmv-over-come-on-you-whites-vanity-plate,"Jon Kotler, a lawyer and constitutional scholar at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalist, has been an avid fan of the London-based soccer club for years, diligently watching as they battled to re-enter the Premier League over the 2017-2018 season. Inspired by their triumph, Kotler applied for a vanity plate to proudly proclaim his loyalty to the club by using an acronym for the team’s slogan, “Come on You Whites,” or “COYW.”

The California DMV rejected the proposed plate, claiming that the abbreviation could have “racial overtones,” and carry “connotations offensive to good taste and decency.”
Kotler claims in a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles that the department’s rejection of his personalized license plate violated his First Amendment rights – specifically his freedom of speech.

""You can&apos;t allow bureaucrats to make decisions that are fundamental to what it means to be an American, and our free speech is one of those things,"" Kotler said in a news release . ""As I tell my students, ours is the only constitution in the world that protects its citizens against their own government. When the government starts to infringe on our rights, that&apos;s when the individual citizen must speak up. If we don’t, we’ll get what we deserve and will have only ourselves to blame.""
The Department of Motor Vehicles said Tuesday that it does not comment on pending lawsuits.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel)
In its rejection letter to Kotler, the Department of Motor Vehicles acknowledged the difficulties in balancing ""an individual&apos;s constitutional right to free speech and expression while protecting the sensibilities of all segments of our population.""
""I sent them tons of material,"" Kotler told the BBC . ""Press releases, stories from the British media, letters from the chairman who uses &apos;come on you whites&apos;.”
He added: “I pointed out that many clubs in Britain are known by their color - the blues, the clarets. Nobody thought the Liverpool reds were communists. Even when I did it, it was the furthest thing from my mind that anyone would object to it. I was shocked, absolutely.""
The 78-year-old, who was born in New Jersey and now lives in Calabasas, California, told the BBC that he has been a fan of Fulham FC for decades after watching a match “by happenstance” during a visit to London.
He said he travels to see the team play in Britain an average of around eight to 10 times a season – often taking the 11-hour flight on a Thursday and returning back to the U.S. by Tuesday for classes.
Kotler&apos;s suit asks the court to declare the Department of Motor Vehicles&apos; criteria for personalized license plates unconstitutional. He also wants the department to pay his court costs.
According to Los Angeles Magazine , the California DMV receives hundreds of thousands of vanity license plates applications – nearly 250,000 were fielded by the department in 2018.
The department employs four full-time workers to sort through the applications and eliminate any that may trigger the DMV’s standard of “good taste and decency.”
In a 1973 case, the California Court of Appeals upheld the Department of Motor Vehicles&apos; standard in rejecting a plaintiff&apos;s claim that his free speech was violated when the department rejected his requested license plate, ""EZ LAY.""
Constitutional scholar David L. Hudson said courts are often split in cases claiming censorship over personalized plates.
""It appears in this case that the government has engaged in regrettable censorship of Mr. Kotler&apos;s speech,"" said Hudson, who teaches at Tennessee&apos;s Belmont University and is a fellow at the Freedom Forum Institute. ""To me, courts should be very sensitive to viewpoint discrimination and should err on the side of protecting the individual&apos;s speech from government censorship.""
Kotler is being represented pro bono by the libertarian-leaning nonprofit Pacific Legal Foundation. The group criticized the Department of Motor Vehicles&apos; ""attempt to make itself the speech police"" in a statement announcing the lawsuit.
""You can call Jon a sports fan or a First Amendment expert, but the DMV&apos;s misguided efforts to regulate license plates have misbranded Jon as a racist,"" the foundation said.

Murder trial opens for man building bunker before fire,www.foxnews.com,MICHAEL KUNZELMAN,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/murder-trial-opens-for-man-building-bunker-before-fire,"But a defense attorney for 27-year-old Daniel Beckwitt told jurors the deadly fire that killed his client&apos;s friend was an accident, not a crime. ""Secrecy does not equate to lack of safety,"" Beckwitt&apos;s lawyer, Robert Bonsib, said during the trial&apos;s opening statements.
Beckwitt is charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in the September 2017 death of 21-year-old Askia Khafra. The two men met online, and Beckwitt had invested money in a company Khafra was trying to launch as he helped Beckwitt dig the tunnels.
Firefighters found Khafra&apos;s charred, naked body in the basement when they entered the home in Bethesda, a suburb of Washington, D.C. A hole in the basement floor led them to the tunnels where Khafra worked for days at a time.
Montgomery County prosecutor Marybeth Ayres said Beckwitt created a ""death trap"" in his family&apos;s home, with mounds of trash blocking Khafra&apos;s escape. The hoarding conditions in the house were so extreme that trash and clutter mostly covered the floors and nearly reached the ceiling in spots, Ayres said.
""You had to hike over this garbage to get out,"" she told jurors.
Bonsib said Khafra was a willing participant in the project. He showed jurors a ""selfie"" photograph that Khafra posted on social media, showing him in the tunnels.
""He was proud of what he was doing, and he was promoting it to his friends,"" Bonsib said.
Prosecutors have described Beckwitt as a skilled computer hacker who had a paranoid fixation on a possible nuclear attack by North Korea. In 2016, Beckwitt spoke at a hacker convention using the alias ""3AlarmLampscooter"" and wearing a fire-resistant suit and visor that obscured his face. Another prosecutor, Doug Wink, has said Beckwitt was teaching his audience how to make thermite bombs to destroy computer data ""in order to get away with hacking.""
Beckwitt had been digging the tunnels for years and took extraordinary measures to keep his project a secret. He tried to trick Khafra into thinking they were digging the tunnels in Virginia instead of Maryland by having him don ""blackout glasses"" before taking him on a long drive. Beckwitt also used internet ""spoofing"" to make it appear they were digging in Virginia.
A hole in the concrete basement floor led to a shaft that dropped down 20 feet (6 meters) into tunnels that branched out roughly 200 feet (60 meters) in length. The tunnels had lights, an air circulation system and a heater.
Khafra slept and ate in the tunnels. He urinated and defecated into a bucket Beckwitt lowered into the tunnels. He used ""wet wipes"" to clean himself because he didn&apos;t have access to a shower.
""Yes, he agreed to go because he was a dreamer, he was a little bit naive and he ignored red flags,"" Ayres said.
Hours before the fire broke out in the basement, Khafra texted Beckwitt to warn him it smelled like smoke in the tunnels. Ayres said Beckwitt didn&apos;t respond for more than six hours before telling Khfra that there had been a ""major electrical failure."" Instead of getting Khafra out of the tunnels, Beckwitt told him that he ""just switched it all over to another circuit,"" the prosecutor added.
""The theme of this case is secrecy over safety at all costs,"" Ayres said.
Bonsib said Beckwitt screamed for help from neighbors after the fire broke out and risked his own safety in a failed attempt to rescue his friend from the blaze. The defense attorney also noted that Beckwitt&apos;s father owned the house, and he said his client&apos;s parents had created the hoarding conditions.
""He was the functional equivalent of a tenant,"" Bonsib said.
Bonsib told jurors they will hear testimony from another man who had helped Beckwitt dig tunnels before Khafra. Bonsib said the witness will give a far more positive description of living conditions in the tunnels than prosecutors have provided.

The Latest:,www.foxnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/the-latest,"6:40 p.m. Algeria&apos;s official news agency has announced July 4 as the date for presidential elections.
APS quoted a statement Wednesday from the president&apos;s office.
The announcement came a day after Abdelkader Bensalah was installed as interim president following the forced resignation of ailing longtime President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The constitution requires elections to be held within three months.
___
3:45 p.m.
Algeria&apos;s powerful army chief has backed the country&apos;s newly appointed interim leader, and said the military will watch over the process to prepare for presidential elections, but suggested it doesn&apos;t want to intervene.
Ahmed Gaid Salah, speaking at a regional military headquarters in Oran, said it is ""unreasonable"" to organize elections in the three-month transition period allotted by the constitution without institutional guidance, such of that of Abdelkader Bensalah.
The head of the Senate was appointed the day before to replace former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was pressured by massive protests to step down after two decades in office. Bouteflika had tried to hang on, but the pressure increased when Gaid Salah withdrew his support and denounced the corrupt ""gang"" running the country.
___
10:20 a.m.
The Agence France-Press news agency said the Algerian authorities have expelled its bureau chief amid nationwide protests against the government.
AFP chairman Fabrice Fries said in a statement Wednesday that the ""arbitrary decision"" of not renewing Aymeric Vincenot&apos;s press accreditation is ""unacceptable"" and that it is ""out of the question for us, in these circumstances, to appoint a successor for the time being.""
AFP said Vincenot has been stationed in Algiers since June 2017 and left the country after the expiration of a final police deadline to leave. His accreditation was not renewed at the end of 2018.
The move comes after Algerian authorities expelled on March 31 a Reuters journalist after he was arrested for covering protests that prompted ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika&apos;s resignation earlier this month.

In his first speech to the nation in more than three months, Castro said Wednesday that U.S. pressure on Venezuela and Cuba could lead to already notable shortages increasing sharply in coming months.
It has become hard to find basic goods such as chicken, cooking oil, eggs and flour in recent months and state-run newspapers cut their page count last week due to shortages of newsprint.
Castro said, ""We need to be aware of growing problems, and the situation could grow worse in the next few months."""

Hundreds of Honduran migrants reportedly boarded buses in the city of San Pedro Sula before dawn Wednesday and a set out in a caravan hoping to travel the more than 2,450 miles to the United States.
Border Patrol official describes caravan-size influx of migrants arriving in his sector every week Raw video: Chief Patrol Agent Rodolfo Karisch delivers opening statement at Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on 'Unprecedented Migration at the U.S. Southern Border.'
Some of those gathered at the bus station said they are seeking better opportunities away from Honduras because they cannot support their families with what they can earn in their home country.
Nohemy Reyes, who waited at the bus station with one of her five children sleeping on the floor beside her, said her country&apos;s economic troubles are driving her north.

""The economic situation is very difficult,"" she said. But if she finds the U.S. border closed, she said, she will return to Honduras.
Officials in San Pedro Sula told reporters that nearly 1,000 people gathered at the bus terminal after news of a new migrant caravan spread. Some there were unable to board buses and began walking through the rain – some pushing strollers or carrying sleeping children in their arms.
This caravan follows the several thousands of migrants who made the trek north and now remain stranded on the Mexico-U.S. border.
Trump renews focus on immigration crisis, says he will not separate families Trump denies purging Homeland Security staff in wake of immigration crisis; John Roberts reports.
President Trump has railed against increased migrants coming into the U.S. via Mexico and this week threatened to close the border before changing course and threatening tariffs on automobiles produced in Mexico if the country does not stop the flow of Central American migrants.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection has said the influx of migrant families attempting to enter the country has overwhelmed their facilities. The agency announced this week that 53,000 parents and children were apprehended at the southern border in March alone.
Meanwhile, officials said that more 103,000 migrants were turned away from or apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border last month – an increase of nearly 106 percent over the same period last year.
The numbers were made public hours after a top Border Patrol official told lawmakers that authorities have apprehended more families illegally crossing the border between October 2018 and February of this year than during all of the 2018 fiscal year (Oct. 1, 2017-Sept. 30, 2018).
The caravan’s departure comes just days after the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen as part of a larger DHS shakeup orchestrated by Trump.

It is said the president is frustrated with his administration’s inability to stem the tide of migrants from Central America and other parts of the world.
Nielsen was replaced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan in an acting capacity.
Trump on Tuesday said he isn&apos;t planning on reinstating the controversial family separation policy that started during the Obama administration. Last summer, more than 2,500 children were separated from their families before a judge ordered them reunited, a continuation of the practices enacted under the previous president.
Immigration leadership overhaul amid growing concern over border crisis DHS acting deputy secretary resigns amid shake-up; reaction from former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and former Border Patrol chief Mark Morgan.
Obama-era Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan told senators last week that the U.S. is “experiencing a crisis at the southern border at a magnitude never seen in modern times.”
“This is not a manufactured crisis created by those of us who live and work in the border area,"" Morgan said. ""Border Patrol continues to apprehend record numbers of people who purposely violate U.S. immigration laws, we are taken advantage of by gaps in our legal frameworks and that undermine the rule of laws.”

Pence urged the Security Council to act to end the Maduro regime and recognize Interim President Juan Guaido. He said also it’s time for the U.N. to seat Guaido's representative at the U.N. -- and expel the current representative.
“Now it’s time for the United Nations to act, and for the world to stand with the people of Venezuela as they march for freedom,” Pence said.
He also announced the U.S. will be providing nearly $61 million in humanitarian assistance, in addition to the $213 million the State Department says it has already provided to Venezuelan refugees living in nearby countries -- as well as $43 million in development and economic assistance.

Jimmy Kimmel trolls Ted Cruz with Lori Loughlin joke after Texas Tech's NCAA loss,www.foxnews.com,Jennifer Earl,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jimmy-kimmel-lori-loughlin-ted-cruz-ncaa,"""A lot of Texas Tech fans think he&apos;s to blame for the loss,"" suggested Kimmel on Tuesday, noting that Cruz attended the game. The late-night host then pointed to a tweet Cruz posted during the fourth quarter.
""35 seconds. ONE point LEAD. GO RED RAIDERS!!! #1 Defense,"" the senator tweeted, along with a selfie.
""The moment he posted it the game was in overtime and the Red Raiders lost,"" continued Kimmel, as the audience roared with laughter.
The comedian then explained that this has happened to Cruz before.
Last year, Kimmel said Cruz was also blamed for the Houston Rockets&apos; Game 7 loss in the western conference NBA finals.
""And back in 2017, I remember he posted, &apos;Congrats to Lori Loughlin daughter&apos;s acceptance into USC - well-deserved!"" Kimmel then joked, putting up a spoof tweet of Cruz posing in front of a school statue.
""And we all know what happened with that, so ... Poor Ted,"" added Kimmel, referring to Loughlin&apos;s alleged involvement in the multimillion-dollar college admissions cheating scam.
Cruz didn&apos;t directly respond to Kimmel, though he did comment on whether or not he&apos;s a ""jinx"" for popular sports teams.
""Ah, Leftie snark. Tech did great last night, but haters gonna hate. I was there & cheered the Astros on in 2017; I cheered the Spurs on in 2014; I cheered UT on in the Rose Bowl in 2005; and I cheered the Rockets on in 1994. We won them all — that kind of &apos;jinx&apos; is pretty good!"" replied Cruz on Tuesday to an article titled, ""Did Ted Cruz jing Texas Tech with late-game tweet?""
Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, were among 14 people indicted on fraud and money laundering charges Tuesday in the scandal. The couple is accused of forking over $500,000 to ensure their two daughters, Isabella, 20, and Olivia Jade, 19, would get accepted into the University of Southern California as crew team recruits — despite allegedly never having actually participated in the sport.
Celebrities across the Hollywood spectrum have mocked Loughlin as well as ""Desperate Housewives"" actress Felicity Huffman after their alleged roles in the scheme surfaced.

""We need to address it.”
President Trump said Sunday that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan would become acting head of the Department of Homeland Security, with its 240,000 personnel, following the resignation of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
Fleischmann met with Nielsen’s replacement on Monday, after touring the border with the president last week.
“Kevin has come to the table with a tremendous amount of experience. He was actually on Air Force One with the president and myself and Leader McCarthy,” said Fleischmann, referring to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.
“Obviously the president has tremendous confidence in Mr. McAleenan but it was a good bipartisan meeting the other day. We sat down, Republicans and Democrats. He was very forthright. He’s very competent. I think he’s going to do a great job.”
Fleischmann also said he thinks McAleenan will “carry out the administration’s policy.” He said: “President Trump is going to be driving the agenda and I think that’s a good thing. So I think Kevin will be very solicitous of the president’s thoughts and wishes and will act on his orders.”

Plea talks could resolve gun case against white nationalist,www.foxnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/plea-talks-could-resolve-gun-case-against-white-nationalist,"Email WASHINGTON – Plea agreement negotiations are underway to resolve gun-related charges against a self-described white nationalist from Washington, D.C., whose relatives reported concerns about his behavior after last year's Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, according to a court filing Wednesday. Federal prosecutors and a public defender representing Jeffrey Clark Jr. have been negotiating since last November and have taken ""some substantial steps"" that increase the likelihood of a deal, the filing says.
A federal judge agreed to postpone a status hearing for Clark's case from Thursday to May 3, giving attorneys more time.
Clark pleaded not guilty to illegally possessing firearms and high-capacity magazines for rifle ammunition.
The FBI said Clark followed synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers on the Gab social media platform and referred to him as a ""hero"" in a post after the Oct. 27 shootings. Bowers spewed anti-Semitic hatred on his Gab account before killing 11 people inside the synagogue, authorities said.
Clark, then 30, was arrested after relatives called the FBI on Nov. 2 to report their concerns that he could be a danger to himself or others. Relatives told FBI agents that Clark became ""really riled up"" after his younger brother, Edward, shot and killed himself within hours of the Pittsburgh attack.
""After the death of Edward Clark, Jeffrey Clark became more outspoken about his radical views, expressing them openly to his family members who were in the area following Edward Clark's death,"" an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit.

Red-stained Brazil flags at burial of man shot by military,www.foxnews.com,MARIO LOBAO and PETER PRENGAMAN,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/red-stained-brazil-flags-at-burial-of-man-shot-by-military,"Evaldo dos Santos Rosa was killed Sunday when his car was shot 80 times by soldiers in an apparent case of mistaken identity that human rights groups say underscores the heavy handedness of authorities in Rio de Janeiro, a city that has struggled to curb violence. Dos Santos Rosa was driving to a baby shower with his 7-year-old son, his wife, her stepfather and another woman when soldiers started shooting at them. The stepfather was injured as was a pedestrian, but the others in the car were unharmed.
At the funeral, the widow of dos Santos Rosa wailed as her husband&apos;s coffin was carried. She fainted shortly after it was placed in a stone tomb and had to be carried away.
""Justice! Justice!"" chanted more than 100 people on hand, holding yellow and green Brazilian flags splattered with red as a symbol of blood.
President Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain, was elected last year on promises to crack down on crime, in part by shielding police from prosecution for fatalities during operations. The governor of Rio de Janeiro state, an ally of Bolsonaro, has adopted similar rhetoric, and recently said sharpshooters were being used in operations to kill drug traffickers brandishing automatic weapons.
""Authorities are stimulating a culture of shoot first and find out who it is later,"" said Antonio Costa, director of civil rights group Rio de Paz. ""This culture must be confronted.""
A military court judge ordered on Wednesday that nine of 10 soldiers arrested in the death of dos Santos Rosa remain behind bars while the case is investigated.
The military initially said soldiers had responded to gunfire, but police said no weapons were found in the car. On Monday, the military said the soldiers mistook the driver&apos;s car for that of criminals.
In a statement Wednesday, the military lamented the loss of life and said the case would be properly investigated.
Last year, then President Michel Temer decreed a federal intervention in Rio de Janeiro that put the army in charge of security. However, that ended Dec. 31, so soldiers would not legally have been able to conduct patrols.
Soldiers were conducting ""an operation that may have been irregular,"" said Joao Tancredo, a lawyer for the family. ""If there were irregularities, the case should not be tried in military courts.""
Brazil has the dubious distinction of world leader in total homicides, and major cities like Rio de Janeiro often suffer shootouts between traffickers, militias and police.
Police in Rio de Janeiro state have long been accused of extrajudicial killings. In 2018, police officers killed 1,534 people in the state, according to government data.

"Missing Indiana mom linked to foot found in lake, police say",www.foxnews.com,Nicole Darrah,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/indiana-mom-dead-missing-foot-found-lake,"Email
Najah Ferrell was reported missing in March after she failed to show up for work. (Avon Police Department) An Indiana mother is believed to be dead after a human foot was found in a pond earlier this week, officials said Wednesday. On Monday, two fishermen in Crown Point, a city roughly 130 miles northwest of Avon, discovered human remains that investigators confirmed as a foot, Avon Deputy Chief of Investigations Brian Nugent said at a news conference.
The foot was linked to Najah Ferrell, a mother from Avon who vanished on March 15, according to Fox affiliate WXIN . Her family said she was a no-show at work and failed to pick up her children after school.
Investigators later reportedly found items belonging to Ferrell and her car in two separate locations in Indianapolis.
Authorities discovered a tattoo on the foot that “was able to be matched up and found to be consistent with” a tattoo Ferrell was known to have had, the deputy chief said.
He said that two members of Ferrell’s family confirmed to investigators that the tattoo found on the foot matched the missing woman’s, and added that forensic pathologists “believe that the person we have preliminary identified as Najah Ferrell is deceased.”
“We do believe at this point that foul play is involved,” Nugent told reporters, adding that the probe into what happened to the woman is a “death investigation” rather than a “homicide investigation.”
Anyone with information on Ferrell’s disappearance is urged to contact Central Indiana Crime Stoppers at 317-262-8477. Nicole Darrah covers breaking and trending news for FoxNews.com. Trending in US"

Pope calls Nicaragua bishop to Rome,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/pope-calls-nicaragua-bishop-to-rome,"RELIGION Published 1 day ago Pope calls Nicaragua bishop to Rome By GABRIELA SELSER | Associated Press Facebook Twitter Flipboard Print Email MANAGUA, Nicaragua – Pope Francis has asked one of Nicaragua&apos;s most outspoken bishops to come to Rome for an undetermined period of time, church officials said Wednesday.
Silvio Báez, Managua&apos;s auxiliary bishop, has been a vocal critic of President Daniel Ortega and his government&apos;s crackdown on protesters over the past year. He said having to leave Nicaragua fills him with ""sadness and pain.""
Pope Francis recently told the 60-year-old Báez that he is needed in Rome. He didn&apos;t say if the decision was related to an alleged assassination plan revealed by former U.S. Ambassador Laura Dogu.
""He told me, &apos;I&apos;m interested in having you with me here. I need you right now,&apos; and I accepted with loving obedience,"" Báez said.
Báez said the U.S. government warned him of the plot several months ago. He told the pope that he had received a number of death threats during the past year, but it hadn&apos;t kept him from his work.
Drones constantly hover over his home. Men on motorcycles have entered the parking area. And he has had to change his phone number four times because of the threats.
Báez participated as a mediator in the short-lived first round of dialogue between the government and opposition last year. Ortega, who had invited the church to mediate, later blasted the bishops, accusing them of being coup-plotters.
When another round of talks was attempted this year, Báez was not invited to participate. The church withdrew from the talks April 3.
The Nicaraguan government did not immediately comment on Báez.
Nicaraguan writer Sergio Ramírez, winner of the 2017 Cervantes Prize, characterized the move as ""a forced exile"" via Twitter and called it ""a hard hit to the fight for democracy in Nicaragua.""
Last year, Báez and other church officials were attacked by a pro-government mob in the town of Diriamba. Báez escaped with a cut on his arm.
In October, a previously unknown Roman Catholic group in Nicaragua that local press tied to the government sent a letter to Pope Francis with 284,000 signatures asking that Báez be transferred. They accused him of promoting violence.
Báez said Wednesday ""that was all a lie.""
Nearly a year has passed since a move by Ortega&apos;s administration to cut social security benefits spurred large public protests that were met with violence by government forces and their supporters. According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, at least 325 people died in the unrest, 2,000 were wounded and at least 52,000 fled the country for exile."

Orthodox Jews decry public backlash over measles outbreak,www.foxnews.com,Elizabeth Llorente,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/faith-values/orthodox-jews-backlash-measles-outbreak,"New York City declares public health emergency over measles outbreak Measles outbreak spreads throughout New York State with three major areas being affected: Rockland County, Brooklyn and Westchester County; Bryan Llenas reports. As New York officials sound alarms this week about the measles outbreak in urban and suburban areas that include concentrations of Orthodox Jews, leaders of those communities are pushing back, saying that they are being stigmatized as being anti-vaccination and indifferent about public health. “The knee-jerk reaction is it that it must be happening because ‘they don’t vaccinate their children the way others do,’” said Avrohom Weinstock, the associate director of education affairs for Agudath Israel of America, an Orthodox Jewish umbrella organization. “There are some who don’t vaccinate, just like in any other community, but it’s a minority.”
Orthodox Jews say that contrary to public opinion, their faith does not push an anti-vaccination view.
“There’s no Eleventh Commandment that says ‘Thou Shall Not Vaccinate,’” said Weinstock, who has been in touch with New York health officials. “Part of the religion says that you should guard your soul, which is also interpreted as ‘Guard your body,’ that means we actually have a mandate to try to stay healthy.”
Health officials have documented more than 400 measles cases in New York since last fall. Most involve Hasidic Jews, according to The New York Times.
YESHIVA SCHOOLS ORDERED TO EXCLUDE UNVACCINATED STUDENTS AMID MEASLES SURGE
The outbreak is traced to ultra-Orthodox Jews in New York who in October traveled to Israel, which was experiencing a measles outbreak then. The travelers included children who were not vaccinated and came back with the measles.
The ultra-Orthodox community, some leaders say, was particularly vulnerable, given its tight-knit nature, the close living quarters in urban neighborhoods, and the custom of having children in tow at gatherings at synagogues and other public places.
“If people don’t realize that it may be more complex than they’re saying,” Weinstock said, “they’re never going to get to the root of the cause of a medical problem if they’re misidentifying why this is.”
""While certainly, the county is trying to aggressively stem the tide of disease spread,"" Weinstock added, ""we are concerned that an unintended consequence of this will be mistrust in an already strained community relationship. I’ve seen far too many horrific and offensive social media comments.""
Dr. Sruly Zyskind, a pediatrician in Brooklyn -- the heart of the New York outbreak -- whose patients are predominately Orthodox Jews, said most of his patients are immunized, and their parents are concerned about the outbreak.
“There are some [in the community] who have been influenced by anti-vaxxers, but they are a small, very small, minority,” he said.
New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot acknowledged this week that the majority of religious leaders in the large Orthodox communities support vaccination efforts, but that rates have remained low in some areas because of a resistance ""fueled by a small group of anti-vaxxers in these neighborhoods.""
Anti-vaccination advocates have targeted ultra-Orthodox communities, dispensing literature warning against dangers of vaccines that many health experts say are baseless.
“It’s very clear that vaccines are important and they’re safe... Perhaps the most important breakthrough in medicine have been vaccines,” Zyskind said. “Anti-vaxxers haven’t seen what measles did 50, 60 years ago, when tens of thousands of Americans died from measles. They just didn’t see that.” Elizabeth Llorente is Senior Reporter for FoxNews.com, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnews.com. Follow her on Twitter @Liz_Llorente. ADVERTISEMENT"

(Glen Stubbe/Star Tribune via AP) ORONO, Minn. – Authorities are investigating the deaths of two people found at the Lake Minnetonka mansion of Irwin Jacobs, a prominent Minnesota businessman who once owned a minority share in the Minnesota Vikings NFL team. Orono, Minnesota, police say the bodies of a man and woman were discovered in a bed along with a gun after authorities received a call at 8:31 a.m. Wednesday. Police have not released their names, but said no suspects are being sought.
Dennis Mathisen, a longtime friend of the family, told the Star Tribune that Alexandra Jacobs, who had been Irwin's wife for 57 years and mother to their five children, ""had been in a wheelchair for the last year or so and had signs of dementia. Irwin was just distraught over her condition.""
He said he spoke with Irwin Jacobs about three days ago, and ""he was upbeat. I talked with his son Mark yesterday, and he talked to both of them. He said Irwin seemed up.""
The Hennepin County Crime Lab was called to the scene, as was a hearse.
Irwin Jacobs, 77, had a stake in the Vikings in the 1980s before selling his share. He gained notoriety nationally in the 1980s as a corporate raider who bought out underperforming companies at a profit. He was known to some as ""Irv the Liquidator.""
One of his most notable local transactions was his purchase of the Grain Belt beer company and brewery in the mid-1970s. He later sold the beer brand to G. Heileman Brewing Company and the brewery and real estate assets to the city of Minneapolis.
He has owned J.R. Watkins Co., which makes soaps and other household products, for more than 40 years. He also owns Jacobs Trading Co., a retailer specializing in liquidation of merchandise.
Jacobs also owned local boat maker Genmar Holdings Co., which went through bankruptcy restructuring beginning in 2009. Trending in US"

FILE - In this June 2, 2017 file photo, former Penn State President Graham Spanier departs after his sentencing hearing at the Dauphin County Courthouse in Harrisburg, Pa. On Wednesday April, 10, 2019 court officials released an order from Judge John Boccabella that says Spanier, who has remained out on bail after his 2017 conviction for misdemeanor child endangerment, has three weeks to report to jail. He is to start serving a sentence imposed over his handling of a complaint about Jerry Sandusky showering with a boy. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) HARRISBURG, Pa. – Former Penn State President Graham Spanier must report to jail by May 1 to start serving a criminal sentence for his handling of a complaint about Jerry Sandusky showering with a boy, under a judge's order made public Wednesday. Judge John Boccabella said Spanier may do his time in the jail near his home in State College if county jail wardens approve. If not, he has to report to the Dauphin County Prison in Harrisburg. The judge also gave his approval for Spanier to participate in a work-release program.
Spanier, 70, has remained out on bail since his 2017 conviction by a jury of a single misdemeanor count of child endangerment. He was sentenced to a minimum of two months in jail and two months of house arrest.
A lawyer for Spanier declined to comment Wednesday. The attorney general's office, which prosecuted Spanier, also did not comment.
Spanier was forced out as university president in November 2011, days after Sandusky, a former assistant football coach at Penn State, was first charged with child molestation. Spanier was charged a year later, although many of the counts against him were thrown out prior to trial.
Two high-ranking administrators under Spanier, former athletic director Tim Curley and former vice president Gary Schultz, pleaded guilty to child endangerment on the eve of trial and testified against him.
The state Supreme Court in February declined to take up Spanier's appeal, leaving in place a lower court's decision that had upheld his conviction.
Last month, Spanier filed a federal petition asking a judge to vacate his conviction, arguing that it involved a version of the law that wasn't in place at the time of the 2001 shower incident and challenging how the statute of limitations was applied to his case.
Spanier did not testify on his own behalf and told Boccabella at sentencing that he regretted not intervening more forcefully.
He has said Sandusky's attack on the boy was characterized to him as horseplay.
A Penn State spokeswoman said Wednesday Spanier remains a tenured faculty member on administrative leave.
Sandusky is serving a 30- to 60-year state prison sentence and recently won an order for a new sentence. He continues to assert his innocence. Trending in US"

1:40 p.m.
A U.S. jury has found a former priest guilty of sexually abusing a boy nearly three decades ago at a veterans&apos; cemetery and Air Force base in New Mexico.
The jury reached the verdict Wednesday against 81-year-old Arthur Perrault, who had vanished from New Mexico in 1992.
He was returned to the United States in September from Morocco to face charges of aggravated sexual abuse and abusive sexual contact.
Authorities believe Perrault had multiple victims in New Mexico, but the charges against him stemmed only from the treatment of one boy at Santa Fe National Cemetery and Kirtland Air Force Base, where Perrault was a chaplain.
Prosecutors say the locations fall under federal jurisdiction.
Perrault maintained in court proceedings that he was innocent of the charges.
__
9:30 a.m.
It will be up to a federal jury in New Mexico to decide the fate of a former Roman Catholic priest who is accused of sexually abusing an altar boy decades ago.
Deliberations began Wednesday in Santa Fe, where Arthur Perrault is being tried on charges of aggravated sexual abuse and abusive sexual contact.
Prosecutors in closing arguments described Perrault as a ""serial molester,"" while his defense questioned whether the case was built on ""false memories.""
Once the pastor of one of New Mexico&apos;s largest Catholic parishes, Perrault vanished from the state in 1992 as an attorney prepared to file two lawsuits against the Archdiocese of Santa Fe alleging he had sexually assaulted seven children.

Though one of the dogs, named Snuggles, was “unmotivated to perform,” according to a statement , the other three were able to correctly identify blood samples with lung cancer 96.7 percent of the time as well as normal blood samples 97.5 percent of the time.
The experiment, conducted by researchers at the Florida pharmaceutical lab BioScentDx, trained the beagles to differentiate between blood samples from lung cancer patients and normal blood samples.
The beagles were able to detect the differences because dogs have smell receptors that are 10,000 times more accurate than humans’, according to the statement.
Heather Junqueira, who led the study, said her findings could lead to other cancer-screening tools, which are important because early cancer detection often means higher chances of survival.
“This work is very exciting because it paves the way for further research along two paths, both of which could lead to new cancer-detection tools,” Junqueira said.
“One is using canine scent detection as a screening method for cancers, and the other would be to determine the biologic compounds the dogs detect and then design cancer-screening tests based on those compounds,” she added.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison advised Governor-General Peter Cosgrove as representative of Australia&apos;s head of state, Queen Elizabeth II, to set the election date.
Morrison is expected to announce later Thursday that Australia will go to the polls on May 18.
Morrison&apos;s conservative coalition is seeking a third three-year term. But Morrison is the third prime minister to lead a divided government in that time and only took the helm in late August.
Opinion polls suggest his reign will become one of the shortest in the 118-year history of Australian prime ministers on election day. The polls suggest center-left opposition leader Bill Shorten will become the eighth prime minister since the country plunged into an extraordinary period of political instability in 2007.
The election pits Shorten, a former labor union leader who has presented himself as the alternative prime minister for the past six years, and Morrison, a leader who the Australian public is still getting to know."
Dem women shrug off Biden controversy in poll,www.foxnews.com,Paul Steinhauser,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-women-shrug-off-biden-controversy-in-poll,"A Quinnipiac University public opinion survey of California voters also suggests that Biden – who’s likely to launch a White House bid in the coming weeks – is the leader of the pack in the Golden State among the large field of contenders vying for the Democratic presidential nomination. Two-thirds of voters questioned in the live operator survey – including 67 percent of women, 71 percent of Democrats, and even 55 percent of Republicans - said the controversy was not a serious issue.
""&apos;Let Biden be Biden,&apos; say California voters, clearly unconcerned about former Vice President Joe Biden&apos;s tactile embrace of supporters,"" Quinnipiac Polling assistant director Tim Malloy said. ""But there is one noticeable generational split. The youngest of voters are far more inclined to say, &apos;hands off.&apos;""
Video Biden’s well publicized and decades long affectionate brand of physical politics was thrust into the spotlight nearly two weeks ago, thanks to allegations from 2014 Nevada Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Lucy Flores. She said in an essay published in New York Magazine that Biden made her feel ""uneasy, gross, and confused"" at a campaign rally when she said he kissed her on the back of the head. Her claims quickly went viral and became a top cable news story for a week.
In the ensuing days, six other women came forward to recount similar physical encounters with Biden that they said made them feel uneasy.
Those accounts were countered by dozens of testimonials from women – ranging from former Biden staffers to lawmakers – who said they had always viewed the former vice president as supportive.
Speaking with reporters last Friday, the former vice president stressed, “I’m sorry I didn’t understand more. I’m not sorry for any of my intentions. I’m not sorry for anything I’ve ever done. I’ve never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman.”
And Biden explained that ""it is incumbent on me and everybody else to make sure that if you embrace someone, if you touch someone, it’s with their consent, regardless of your intentions.""
Video ""It’s my responsibility to do that,"" he added.
According to the poll, 26 percent of likely Democratic presidential primary voters in California say they would support Biden as their party’s nominee, with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in second place at 18 percent. Sen. Kamala Harris of California, the state’s former attorney general, was a percentage point behind Sanders, at 17 percent.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg stood at seven percent, with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former San Antonio mayor and former Health and Human Services secretary Julian Castro each at two percent. Everyone else in the large field of 2020 contenders registered at one percent or less.
Thirty-five percent of Democrats or Democrat-leaning independents said Biden had the best chance of beating Republican President Donald Trump in the 2020 general election, and 31 percent said Biden would be the best leader.
California is playing a more influential role in the 2020 nominating process, thanks to a move by the state to push it’s primary up to early March. California will be the largest of the 12 states scheduled to vote on March 3, 2020, directly after the early voting primary and caucus states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.
The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted April 3 - 8, with 1,005 California voters question. The survey’s overall sampling error is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points, with 5.9 percentage plus or minus margin of error for questions of likely Democratic primary voters.

Vermont high school to raise Black Lives Matter flag,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/vermont-high-school-to-raise-black-lives-matter-flag,"Administration Published 1 day ago Vermont high school to raise Black Lives Matter flag Associated Press Facebook Twitter Flipboard Print Email RUTLAND, Vt. – A Vermont public school board has voted to fly the Black Lives Matter flag at a high school.
The Rutland Herald reports that the Rutland City Public Schools Board of Commissioners reaffirmed the plan during a vote Tuesday.
Board member Kam Johnston says he moved to rescind the board&apos;s previous decision to raise the flag to allow for more student input and address concerns. Students at Rutland High School had initiated the effort to raise the flag and brought it to the board.
The Black Lives Matter flag will fly at the school for 400 days starting April 12 to mark 400 years since the British slave trade started in the Americas.
People opposed to flying the flag say the board shouldn&apos;t be taking a political stance and that the flag may be divisive.

Limo company operator pleads not guilty in fatal crash,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/limo-company-operator-pleads-not-guilty-in-fatal-crash,"Nauman Hussain, 29, operator of Prestige Limousine, was released on $450,000 bond after his arraignment in Schoharie County Court and will be subject to electronic monitoring until his Sept. 9 trial. He had been free on $150,000 bond since his arrest in October. Prestige&apos;s stretch limousine ran a stop sign at a T-intersection on Oct. 6 and crashed beside a country store, killing the driver, two pedestrians and 17 passengers bound for a birthday celebration. State police said the 2001 Ford Excursion limo should not have been on the road due to safety issues.
The crash was the deadliest transportation disaster in the United States in a decade. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating, but a final report could be more than a year away.
Defense attorney Lee Kindlon said in a court brief that extensive records demonstrate the company&apos;s efforts to maintain the vehicle&apos;s road-worthiness. He said the intersection&apos;s design and ""treacherous"" road conditions contributed to the accident, and he contended that the driver had ""a number of intoxicants"" including marijuana in his system. Neither state police nor the prosecutor has disclosed information about the driver&apos;s toxicology report.
""This case is far from a slam dunk,"" Joe Tacopina, another defense attorney, said during the hearing before Judge George Bartlett.
Kindlon said the top count in the indictment handed up last Friday carries a sentence of up to 15 years.
The limousine company is owned by Hussain&apos;s father, Shahed Hussain, who has been in Pakistan since before the crash. He has not been charged criminally but is named as a defendant along with his son in civil suits brought by families of the crash victims.
In his brief, Kindlon said Shahed Hussain was born in Pakistan, came to the U.S. as a child and became a citizen about 10 years ago. He owns several rental properties in the Albany area.
Schoharie County District Attorney Susan Mallery, arguing against bail, called Hussain a ""flight risk"" because his father lives in Pakistan.

FILE - In this July 23, 2018, file photo, a poster of Justine Ruszczyk Damond is displayed at a news conference by attorneys for her family in Minneapolis. The Minneapolis woman who was fatally shot by a police officer in 2017 had spent a lifetime trying to help people and animals. Damond's relatives describe her as an animal lover who originally trained as a veterinary surgeon. (AP Photo/Amy Forliti, File) MINNEAPOLIS – When Justine Ruszczyk Damond heard someone cry out in the alley behind her home in July 2017, she did what she had spent a lifetime doing: She immediately tried to help. Damond called 911 not once but twice to report what she thought was a sexual assault. When officers arrived, she ran outside in her bare feet and pajamas, prosecutors say. Moments later, she lay dying of a gunshot fired by the officer who is now on trial in her death.
The 40-year-old life coach with dual citizenship in the U.S. and Australia ""yearned to help people,"" according to a $50 million lawsuit filed by her family. That lawsuit is on hold while former officer Mohamed Noor stands trial on murder and manslaughter charges.
Originally trained as a veterinary surgeon in Australia, Damond was known as an animal lover. To her friends' children, she was ""Auntie Juzzy."" She received a veterinary degree from the University of Sydney in 2002 but decided to pursue personal health as a career path, according to the lawsuit, which was filed a little over a year after her death.
Growing up, Damond said on a YouTube video , she saw addiction, depression and cancer in her family. That led to her interest in meditation and yoga. She taught meditation classes and before her death was preparing a curriculum for meditative training, the lawsuit said.
Her fiancé, Don Damond, recalled Tuesday on the witness stand how she put masking tape across the bottom half of a glass door at their Minneapolis home to prevent a rescue dog that ""didn't understand what glass was"" from crashing into it.
The dog traveled from half a world away to join the family. Justine Damond, who had already taken her fiance's last name professionally, had heard from friends that a woman in Egypt could no longer care for three of her dogs. So she rented a van, drove to Chicago, where the dogs had been flown, and returned with them to Minneapolis, where she cared for them until she could find them new homes, her fiance testified.
Video taken just weeks before her death shows her rescuing ducklings from a storm sewer, gathering up the tiny birds in her skirt and returning them to their mother.
Don Damond testified that he was on a business trip to Las Vegas the night of the shooting. The couple were set to be married a month later in Hawaii. Instead, hundreds of mourners attended a lakeside memorial service at the same time the family had planned to be on a plane to the wedding. An Australian flag was displayed prominently on stage next to her picture.
The couple met in 2012 while at a meditation seminar in Colorado. Don Damond testified that it was love at first sight. He said his bride-to-be ""had a gift that people just wanted to be around her.""
In January 2015, he proposed and she accepted. The couple originally planned to move to Australia, but Don Damond's son, Zach, was concerned about being half a world away from his father. Justine Damond agreed to move to the Fullton neighborhood of Minneapolis, a low-crime, middle-class area, according to the family's lawsuit.
Just before 11:30 p.m. on July 15, 2017, she called her fiance and described hearing ""a woman in distress."" She believed the screams were coming from the alley behind their neighbor's house. Don Damond suggested she call police. He said the couple had a sense they had called ""the right people.""
After she called 911, Don Damond said to himself, ""All will be well.""
More than eight minutes after her first 911 call, after seeing that no police had arrived, Justine Damond called again to make sure emergency dispatchers had her correct address. She also called her husband-to-be again and said she was still hearing the woman in distress. She then hung up, telling him, ""OK, the police are here."" It was the last time they spoke.
He has since sold the house, saying that it was ""too painful"" to stay there.
Prosecutors charge Noor acted recklessly when he fired one shot across his partner and through the open driver's side window of the police SUV, striking Damond in the abdomen and killing her. Defense attorneys argue Noor was defending himself and his partner and that the shooting was ""a perfect storm with tragic consequences.""
Noor's patrol partner, Matthew Harrity, said he heard a thump that startled him just before the shooting and that the officers ""got spooked"" when Justine Damond approached them. But prosecutor Patrick Lofton said in his opening statement that Harrity did not describe any noise while at the scene and only mentioned it for the first time days later to investigators. Lofton also said there is no forensic evidence that shows Justine Damond touched the squad car before she was shot, raising questions about whether she hit or slapped the SUV.
Crime-scene photos and video played in court Wednesday show Damond's body covered by a white sheet at the base of a driveway near the police squad car.
Just 1 minute and 19 seconds after talking to her fiancé for the last time, she was cradling her abdomen from a gunshot wound, saying ""I'm dying.""

Since he was elected prime minister in a leadership ballot of colleagues in his conservative Liberal Party on Aug. 24, 2018, Morrison has taken as much time as he had available to repair the government and define his leadership before facing the voters.
The government&apos;s fortunes have gone downhill since then, losing two lawmakers and with them its single-seat majority in Parliament as part of the blood-letting that has followed the ouster of Morrison&apos;s predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull.
Opinion polls suggest the center-left Labor Party will win government.
