No chance for peace: The Trump administration seems to have singlehandedly done away with any chance for peace between Israel and Palestine, but really, the process has been doomed for a while—previous presidents tried and failed to broker any agreements, leaving the untenable status quo we face today. Khaled Elgindy explains why this isn’t just Trump’s fault, but also Clinton’s, Bush’s, and Obama’s . Listen up, 2020 Dems: Pro-choice Democrats, including Bernie Sanders on Monday, keep stumbling over questions from conservatives and anti-choice activists about third-trimester abortions. Christina Cauterucci did the work for them in consulting physicians and reproductive rights experts on how to answer the somewhat-absurd question “Do you support abortion in the moments before birth?” Feel free to adopt her script, politicians .

Herman Cain is not actually withdrawing from the Fed race.,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/herman-cain-fed-race-wsj-kudlow-romney.html,"This One Question Always Trips Up Pro-Choice Politicians. Allow Me to Help. Forget what you heard. Herman Cain isn’t bowing out of the Fed race after all. In an interview published Wednesday, the former Godfather’s Pizza CEO and one-time presidential candidate told the Wall Street Journal that, contrary to some news reports, he is not planning to pull himself out of the running for a seat at the Federal Reserve, even though he appears to lack enough support to be confirmed by Congress. Donald Trump announced earlier this month that he intended to nominate Cain, a political ally with little relevant monetary policy experience, for one of the two open spots on the central bank’s seven-member Board of Governors. Economists collectively wretched at the decision. And, somewhat surprisingly, so have a number of Senate Republicans, four of whom have said they would not vote for Cain if he is officially nominated. Some have cited the sexual harassment allegations that sank Cain’s presidential bid in 2012. Others, like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, have pretty much written him off as an unqualified partisan. But whatever the reasons, Cain currently doesn’t have enough votes to make it through Congress without Democratic support, which probably isn’t forthcoming. Last week ABC News reported that Cain would withdraw himself from consideration. But on Tuesday , Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow suggested that might not happen. “At the end of the day, it will probably be up to Herman Cain if he wants to stay in that process or not,” Mr. Kudlow told reporters Tuesday. “As far as we are concerned, he is still in the process and it is proceeding.” Kudlow added that while Trump was still interested in Cain, the White House was talking to “a number of candidates” for the Fed. Now, Cain says he isn’t going anywhere. Per the WSJ:
“What Kudlow was doing was giving me an out, and I appreciate that, but I don’t want an out. I don’t want an out,” Mr. Cain said, adding that he doesn’t think the White House is getting cold feet about his potential nomination.
“You know that the president is a fighter, and Kudlow is a fighter. They might be getting a lot of blowback from some folks, I don’t know. But I don’t think they’re getting uncomfortable with it.” To be honest, I don’t know what to make of any of this. I mean, maybe Donald Trump ends up nominating a former pizza executive who’s been accused of being a serial sexual harasser to the single most powerful economic institution in the world and just dares Republicans to actually vote the guy down. Or maybe not. But hey, at least it’s more entertaining that your typical Fed nomination process, which tends to be dry as an econometrics textbook. This saga is a good time. Everyone’s having fun?

Police memes won’t improve trust.,slate.com,April Glaser,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/police-memes-law-enforcement-trust-social-media.html,"Future Tense Newsletter: A Theory of Conspiracy The rents in the Bay Area are among the highest in the nation—in Oakland, the median rent for a one-bedroom is $2,320 a month. Which is probably why the California Highway Patrol thought this tweet would be funny: Breaking News❗️The only thing 🆓 about disregarding the safety of yourself or others on our roadways is a 🆓 ride from us to this rent-🆓 location✅ #Facts #StayWoke #WedontplaywithDUI #ForYourSafety #DontBecomeaAStatistic #FreeRentInTheBayArea pic.twitter.com/zngxJd2bpj — CHP Oakland (@CHPoakland) December 30, 2018 Maybe some people laughed, but I doubt it dissuaded anyone from driving under the influence. Police use social media to send announcements of road closures, to issue reports of missing persons, to post photos of people they arrest or are looking for in relation to a crime. But law enforcement agencies also turn to social media for the same lighter fare so many of us seek on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter: memes, viral videos, cute dog photos, and ironic jokes about drugs. It’s a form of community engagement. “One way of bolstering your following and connecting with the community is through the occasional use of humor, when appropriate,” says Jaime Coffee, a public information officer with the California Highway Patrol, who noted that some of their humor on social media has made it into local news reports, boosting the visibility of their accounts. Last year, police departments across the country took part in an online lip-syncing challenge. Videos of cops in Norfolk, Virginia , singing Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars’ “Uptown Funk” and officers in San Francisco doing a rendition of “Lights” by Journey, for example, went viral, garnering hundreds of thousands of views. Community engagement and showing the human side of officers is a reasonable pursuit. But posts like the one by the California Highway Patrol joking about jail and gentrification in Oakland don’t always come off as funny as intended. “There’s nothing inherently wrong with a cute cop,” John Crew, a retired police practices specialist for the American Civil Liberties Union told me in an interview. “I think the reason you’re seeing attempts at social media across the country is that police agencies and the policing profession are aware that they’ve got a problem.” Part of that problem is trust: Only 44 percent of adults under the age of 35 have a great deal of confidence in the police, according to the most recent Gallup poll . But witty social media is unlikely to fix that problem, Crew says. “If they think the problem is how they’re perceived, then they think the response is to project a better image and not ‘We need more police accountability’ or ‘We have an implicit bias problem.’ They think they’re just not understood.” But if police fear they’re misunderstood, officers may not understand the communities they’re policing either. “Please help! My name is 10 Pounds of Weed. I am lost and looking for my owner. I was sent to the wrong address yesterday in Columbus and now the police have me locked up in the evidence room. Please get me out of here soon, you will need your ID. Thanks a bunch,” reads a tweet last year from the Columbus, Indiana, Police Department. Hilarious … except nearly 6 percent of all arrests in the United States in 2017 were based on possession of marijuana. In Indiana alone in 2016 more than 10,000 people were arrested for marijuana possession and sales, according to FBI data. There’s nothing funny about being arrested, which could lead to jail, legal fees, or time away from work and family, all for possessing a substance that’s legal in 10 states. Lawrence, Kansas, police took a similar approach the year before with this tweet: S anyone know where the marijuana and ecstasy tablet parties are this weekend? Asking for a friend. Trust us, we're hip. — Lawrence Police (@LawrenceKS_PD) March 3, 2017 More recently, a viral Facebook photo of two Mineral Wells, Texas, police officers eating doughnuts in a field of waist-high flowers was shared more than 132,000 times. The caption reads, “Felt cute might arrest someone later idk.” The comments section on the photo morphed into a mini-contest in wry anti-police sentiment. “Felt cute, might racially profile later,” said one person. Another wrote, “Felt cute, might ruin someone’s life for possession of a plant later.” Though most of the top comments appear to be antagonistic toward the police, the post that got the most reactions—more than 8,000—was from the police department in Anchorage, Alaska, asking where the Texas cops got their doughnuts. It’s like what fast food Twitter accounts do , only instead of jokes about unhealthy food, cops are laughing about their power to put someone in jail. Sometimes police department social media use can seriously backfire. Beyond coming off as tone-deaf, sometimes police department social media use can seriously backfire. In 2017, a trio of police officers in Gainesville, Florida, posted a selfie of themselves working on Hurricane Irma relief efforts. Commenters noticed that the officers were attractive, and the post went viral-viral—the Washington Post even wrote about the #HotCops. But it only took a few days for an online sleuth to unearth anti-Semitic Facebook posts by one of the officers in the photo, after which he was suspended. (Notably, one of the police pictured, Daniel Rengering, had better luck after his social media spotlight. He’s gone on to become a cover model for romance novels and was on Survivor: David vs. Goliath in the fall.) But there are times when law enforcement social media accounts use their online mouthpieces for good—like to invite community feedback and accountability efforts. The San Francisco Police Department, for example, regularly tweets about “office hours” it holds around the city where the community is invited to share concerns, and it shares links to “know your rights” brochures. But the same SFPD account posts mug shots of arrested suspects who may eventually be found not guilty or have their charges dropped. Similarly, the Berkeley Police Department decided to post the names and faces of anti-fascist demonstrators last year after they were arrested, which compromised their privacy and put them in danger of harassment from far-right activists. “Police used to put this information out for reporters, so they’d say, ‘What’s the difference [with social media]?’ ” says Lauri Stevens, who organizes the Social Media, the Internet and Law Enforcement, or SMILE, conference, a regular training event for police departments looking to improve their use of social media. “But when you put it out on Facebook, it’s a bigger deal. People’s reputation can be damaged a lot faster and a lot harder.” One tweet from the Illinois State Police last month included a photo with an array of different types of handcuffs. “We love jewelry. We carry it with us. We even let you wear it when we give you a free ride to jail,” it read, along with the awkward hashtags #BraceletsAreOurFavorite, #SharingIsCaring, and #SoManyChoices. The cops are probably trying to come off as funny. It’s not working. "
North Korea says it just conducted a weapons test. Is this the end of Trump-Kim love-a-thon?,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/north-korea-conducts-weapons-test-trump-kim-summit-nuclear-talks.html,"What the Mueller Report Says About Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump North Korea test-fired a new tactical guided weapon, the country’s state-run media outlet announced Thursday (local time), the latest sign of a tactical chill in the love-a-thon President Trump has been touting between the two leaders. Specifics on the exact type of weapon and the nature of the launch remain unclear, but the Washington Post reports that experts believe the early descriptions of the test make it unlikely it was a ballistic missile, which would be an explicit violation of Pyongyang’s self-declared moratorium on testing, and a substantial setback to whatever peace plan President Trump hopes to muster. North Korean state media said Kim Jong-un himself oversaw the launch, which he described as “an event of very weighty significance.” The recent breakdown of denuclearization talks and Kim’s direct involvement in the test heaped strategic symbolism on the event. Experts were cautious to read too far into North Korea’s intentions, but believed the test to be a show of growing military strength as form of negotiating tactic, without crossing the self-imposed ballistic missile red line. In a speech last week, Kim showed frustration with the tenor of recent peace talks with the U.S. and while he said he was prepared to participate in a third summit with Trump, he cautioned he would do so only if the U.S. changed its approach. Pyongyang’s latest launch is its first public test since February talks in Hanoi broke down. While it is surely a negotiating tactic aimed at focusing the mind in Washington, the escalation threatens one of President Trump’s favorite talking points—progress, real or imagined, with North Korea. In fact, Trump’s political reliance on the North Korea détente has grown such that it could diminish his hand at the negotiating table as the personal price of walking away increases. Is Trump already in too deep? Just earlier this week, days before the test, Trump was touting his relationship with Kim and progress with North Korea as kind of a big deal: Full Trump comments on North Korea, from his event in Minnesota today: pic.twitter.com/WrEpGN7ESm — William Gallo (@GalloVOA) April 15, 2019 Maybe let’s pump the breaks on the Nobel Peace Prize daydreams, look a little less personally needy, and hold our cards a bit closer to our chest.

Meghan and Harry’s Decision Not to Dangle Their Newborn Before the Press Is the Natural Next Step in Their Self-Branding,slate.com,Ruth Graham,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/meghan-harry-baby-royals-social-media-instagram.html,"Chill Out, Pete Davidson. No One’s Shaming You for Dating Kate Beckinsale. When someone’s entire function is ceremonial, it can take on big significance if they change up even a small part of that ceremony. And so we turn our gaze to England, where the tabloid press is currently losing its collective mind over the fact that the next royal baby will not be dangled triumphantly in front of hordes of photographers. The trouble started last week, when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex—Harry and Meghan, that is— issued a statement through Buckingham Palace announcing that they “have taken a personal decision to keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private.” The couple’s first baby is due sometime this spring, although they have not announced a due date. Their statement said they will share the news of the baby’s arrival publicly “once they have had an opportunity to celebrate privately as a new family.” Presumably, the photos will appear on the couple’s new Instagram feed , which recently referred to “Baby Sussex” for the first time . Blimey! As the British press was quick to point out, this change violates a tradition going back a generation. Yes, just one—Princess Diana started it, and Kate and William have kept it up—but still. The tabloids have grown accustomed to waiting outside the London hospital for the royal parents to make an appearance after the baby’s birth. The gussied-up family poses gamely for a few minutes so photographers can get their first shots of the new baby, and then the family escapes to a palace. Harry and Meghan are skipping the scrum and releasing news and photos on their own time. The Sun slammed the couple for “ keeping the nation in the dark ,” while a columnist for the Daily Mail called it “ just a little rude to smother this wonderful moment in a layer of exclusion and exclusivity.” They’re borrowing from the modern playbook of international—and particularly American—celebrities, for whom participating in traditional journalism feels increasingly unnecessary. The New York Times calls the ritual “silly,” but it does serve a certain purpose. It’s understandable that taxpayers who support them expect a peek at the next generation. The hospital display gives the tabloids a bit of chum to satisfy them while the family proceeds to nest privately with their newborn. It is a routine so simple and rigid that the slightest variations can be dissected for meaning: Kate’s visible postpartum belly (“ brave ”); her second baby’s backwards bonnet (“ the newborn has unfortunately already made a sartorial slip-up ”); a red, lace-collared dress reminiscent of her mother-in-law (and of Mia Farrow in Rosemary’s Baby , whoopsy!). The royal family’s only real output is their own image, and they have been drifting toward seizing the means of production for years. The 2015 birth of William and Kate’s daughter, Charlotte, was first announced on Twitter , although the announcement also appeared on the traditional easel outside Buckingham Palace. Kate took the first official photographs of her daughter, rather than hiring a photographer. That didn’t take power away from the voracious British tabloids, however. Her photographs were still distributed through the usual official channels, and portrait photography doesn’t compete with the paparazzi anyway. Harry and Meghan are doing something different, at least on this occasion: shutting out the press in favor of their own social media accounts, which they can control completely. In other words, they’re borrowing from the modern playbook of normal international—and perhaps particularly American—celebrities, for whom participating in traditional journalism feels increasingly unnecessary. Promotion cycles are changing, with albums dropping as overnight surprises instead of being rolled out with months of advance publicity. And above all, social media has given celebrities unprecedented control over their own images—and forced media outlets to play nice if they want any special access at all. Why pose for someone else’s camera when you could take your own photos and distribute only the ones you choose on Instagram? Why speak with a journalist, who will pluck out juicy and surprising and unflattering quotes, if the magazine will publish a gentler, more comfortable “conversation” with a fellow celebrity ? “If the less fun part of an actor’s job is the part where they have to help sell a piece of work or product,” Vanity Fair wrote of the celeb-on-celeb format last year, “at least they can do it with someone they have a relationship with, who won’t push them on harder questions or ask them things they’re sensitive about.” At the highest rung of fame, the celebrity need not speak at all. In 2015, Beyoncé appeared on the cover of Vogue without granting the magazine an interview ; last September, the magazine apparently granted her complete creative control of her cover shoot—and she still didn’t speak with a journalist. The smile-and-wave in front of the hospital in London is not worth mourning for its own sake. Here’s the extent of what we’ll miss: Meghan and Harry’s baby will have a cute scrunched-up little face, and his or her mother’s hair will look great. As a symbol of the royals’ retreat from any kind of direct tabloid scrutiny, however, it’s arguably kind of a loss. Tabloids can be rude and invasive and even false ; the British tabloids are particularly notorious for their rapaciousness. But they’re also irreverent and curious and reader-serving, and a celebrity’s approach to them is often a sign of their responsiveness to press and the public more broadly. No one would begrudge Harry and Meghan some protectiveness over their first few hours of parenthood. But if they manage to keep cutting out the tabloids, don’t be surprised if the ever-more-curated images we’re left with turn out to be just plain dull."
Mueller Report live analysis: William Barr checks in for a second time.,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-live-analysis-barr-press-conference.html,"We’ll be covering everything about the Mueller report, pre- and post-release, on this page, so keep checking in throughout the day (and maybe throughout the night) for updates, insights, and sensationalist exclamations . Update, 12:45 p.m.: Here’s a fun one. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told investigators she lied to the press after Comey firing pic.twitter.com/JNN9ObzKFd — Dorey Scheimer (@DoreyScheimer) April 18, 2019 Update, 12:25 p.m.: Mueller’s reasoning for not prosecuting the June 9 meeting (at which Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner sought to accept “dirt” on Hillary and discussed sanctions with Russian figures) as a violation of campaign-finance laws against accepting foreign assistance is that 1) it’s not legally clear whether “dirt” is a “thing of value” that campaigns are forbidden accepting, and 2) Trump’s advisers didn’t know that accepting foreign assistance was a bad thing. The relevant quote: “On the facts here, the government would unlikely be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the June 9 meeting participants had general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful. The investigation has not developed evidence that the participants in the meeting were familiar with the foreign-contribution ban or the application of federal law to the relevant factual context.” Update, 12:05 p.m.: Pee tape reference! Unfortunately, it’s to say that someone told them that the pee tape was not real. “Comey’s briefing included the Steele reporting’s unverified allegation that the Russians had compromising tapes of the President involving conduct when he was a private citizen during a 2013 trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe Pageant. During the 2016 presidential campaign, a similar claim may have reached candidate Trump. On October 30, 2016, Michael Cohen received a text from Russian businessman Giorgi Rtskhiladze that said, ‘Stopped flow of tapes from Russia but not sure if there’s anything else. Just so you know …. ’ 10/30/16 Text Message , Rtskhiladze to Cohen. Rtskhiladze said ‘tapes’ referred to compromising tapes of Trump rumored to be held by persons associated with the Russian real estate conglomerate Crocus Group, which had helped host the 2013 Miss Universe Pageant in Russia . Rtskhiladze 4/4/ l 8 302 , at 12. Cohen said he spoke to Trump about the issue after receiving the texts from Rtskhiladze. Cohen 9/ 12/ 18 302, at 13. Rtskhiladz e said he was told the tapes were fake, but he did not communicate that to Cohen . Rtskhiladze 5/ l 0/ 18 302, at 7.” Update, 12:00 p.m.: This seems to be the nut of it, from page 5 of the first volume of the report (the second volume is about obstruction): “Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” So, basically, a quid and a quo but not a pro. As to why Mueller decided that the the presidential transition team’s friendly outreach to Russia about sanctions—an issue that campaign figures had previously learned was an issue of concern to the Russian government—didn’t constitute participation in Russia’s election-interference scheme … I haven’t really figured that out! Update, 11:55 a.m.: A lot to process here! First observation: The report indeed documents previously known instances in which Trump figures expressed interest in Russian assistance (e.g., the June 9 Trump Tower meeting), and it documents instances in which the campaign (via Paul Manafort) and presidential transition team (via Michael Flynn) discussed Russia-friendly policies with Russian-government-linked individuals. But it concludes that such activities were not illegal “coordination” or “conspiracy.” Here’s the wording of one summary: “In sum, the investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russian offers of assistance to the Campaign. In some instances , the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away. Ultimately , the investigation did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.” Update, 11:05 a.m.: It’s alive! Click here to see THE MUELLER REPORT at last. Update, 10:40 a.m.: New York magazine’s Eric Levitz makes another good point regarding Barr’s argument that Trump’s hostility to the Mueller investigation was justified. As Levitz points out, Trump wasn’t just angry about Mueller’s investigation because of “collusion” allegations, but because Trump didn’t believe Russia was even responsible for hacking the Democratic Party in the first place. Which, of course, is something that Mueller ended up confirming. So Barr is arguing that Trump was justified in attacking the legitimacy of Mueller’s investigation even though one of Trump’s central objections to it turned out to be wrong. Update, 10:15 a.m.: It appears that Even Fox News (TM) found Barr’s defense of the president to be a bit much. Chris Wallace on Fox: ""The Attorney General seemed almost to be acting as the counselor for the defense, the counselor for the president, rather than the Attorney General, talking about his motives, his emotions... Really, as I say, making a case for the president."" — Michael M. Grynbaum (@grynbaum) April 18, 2019 Update, 10:05 a.m.: LOL. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 18, 2019 Nice coordinated meme rollout between the president and the nation’s chief law-enforcement officer, there. Update, 10:00 a.m.: Barr just made a fairly lengthy argument that anything Trump might have done to obstruct Mueller’s investigation was OK because he knew that he hadn’t committed any “collusion.” Update, 9:40 a.m.: Barr is just repeating everything he said in his March letter , except at a lectern.

William Barr press conference: The news media were “relentless.”,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/william-barr-press-conference-news-media.html,"This One Question Always Trips Up Pro-Choice Politicians. Allow Me to Help. For the most part, Attorney General William Barr’s press conference about the Mueller report (to be released after 11 a.m.) echoed his earlier written summary, with a few more opportunities to reiterate his view that there was no “collusion.” But toward the end of his address, his comments swerved into a rather bizarre and brazen defense of President Donald Trump’s mental state—a line of comments that seemed to bolster the argument that Barr was and is acting as Trump’s attorney, rather than as a representative of the American people. In particular, one strange Trump-like argument toward the end of the address had to do with one of the president’s favorite punching bags: the media (emphasis ours).
In assessing the president’s actions discussed in the report, it is important to bear in mind the context. President Trump faced an unprecedented situation, as he entered into office and sought to perform his responsibilities as president, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office and the conduct of some of his associates. At the same time there was relentless speculation in the news media about the president’s personal culpability, yet as he said from the beginning, there was, in fact, no collusion. As the special counsel’s report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by his sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents and fueled by illegal leaks. This argument—that the “evidence” of the president’s emotional state is relevant to explaining his innocence or at least defending any of his obstruction-adjacent actions—is a remarkable one for an attorney general to make when releasing the results of an independent special counsel investigation. We may not have learned much from this press conference at a factual level, but we definitely got further insight into how Barr and the DOJ sort out their interests, allies, and opposition.

William Barr's press conference on the Mueller report was propaganda.,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/william-barr-robert-mueller-report-address.html,"What the Mueller Report Says About James Comey’s Firing Observers of the Justice Department will spend the rest of our lives talking about Attorney General William Barr’s jaw-dropping and horrifically inappropriate address on Thursday morning, which attempted to spin special counsel Robert Mueller’s report in Donald Trump’s favor—before the public has seen it. In just a few minutes, Barr managed to throw Mueller under the bus, mount a Fox News–style defense of Trump, and further obscure his dubious decision to absolve the president of obstruction of justice. It is hard to convey just how appalling Barr’s performance was, and it will take a while to assess the extent of the damage Barr just inflicted on the Department of Justice and the office of the attorney general. But let me take a first crack: This was Pravda-style propaganda, pure and simple, a grotesque display of spineless fealty to the president, and a confirmation that Barr views the Mueller investigation as fundamentally illegitimate. The first half of Barr’s address was essentially a reiteration of his earlier summary of Mueller’s report, which the attorney general helpfully summed up in Trump’s two favorite words: no collusion. Mueller, Barr explained, found that the Russian government did unlawfully attempt to influence the 2016 election; both Russian military officials and the Internet Research Agency , a troll farm affiliated with the Russian government, meddled in the race. But the special counsel “found no evidence that any Americans—including anyone associated with the Trump campaign—conspired or coordinated with the Russian government or the IRA in carrying out this illegal scheme.” We do not yet know if Barr used this oddly narrow language to conceal attempts by the Trump campaign to collude with Russian agents, or to disseminate stolen material ; to obscure possible coordination with Russian nationals not formally connected to the Russian government; or to obfuscate an extremely cramped definition of conspiracy and collusion. The report itself should help us understand just how candid or dishonest, this segment of Barr’s address was. And hopefully, Barr did not redact portions of the report that might clear up any sleights of hand the attorney general may have performed to gloss over legally troubling conduct by the president and his associates. What we doknow is that the president’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, spoke with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak the same day that President Barack Obama issued retaliatory measures in response to Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. And that Mueller later prosecuted Flynn for lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russian officials . And that Flynn pleaded guilty to this felony charge and cooperated with the probe. And then Trump asked then–FBI Director James Comey to end the investigation into Flynn. We also know that Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations committed in an effort to cover up Trump’s extramarital affair—a crime allegedly committed at the president’s direction, and one that was prosecuted by the Southern District of New York after the special counsel’s office provided it with information about Cohen. And we know that Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the Trump Organization’s attempts to build a new property in Moscow during the presidential campaign. Cohen, in fact, admitted to this crime as part of a plea deal with Mueller. This information is important to keep in mind when considering the second half of Barr’s address, pertaining to obstruction of justice. Barr once again reiterated that he does not believe in Mueller’s legal theory of obstruction. He didn’t elaborate, but his views here are well-known: Barr believes obstruction of an investigation cannot be committed unless there is an underlying crime ( which is wrong ) and that the president cannot commit obstruction by exercising his executive powers, even if done with a corrupt motive ( which is dubious ). But leave that aside for now. What’s truly astonishing is that after briefly attempting to exculpate Trump of obstruction, Barr launched into a vigorous and gratuitous defense of the president’s highly unusual and suspect behavior throughout the probe:
In assessing the President’s actions discussed in the report, it is important to bear in mind the context. President Trump faced an unprecedented situation. As he entered into office, and sought to perform his responsibilities as President, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office, and the conduct of some of his associates. At the same time, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the President’s personal culpability. Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion. And as the Special Counsel’s report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the President was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks. Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims. And at the same time, the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation. Apart from whether the acts were obstructive, this evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation. Barr’s message here is simple: Trump is the real victim. The victim of the media and leaks. The victim of excess scrutiny and oversight. The victim of what Barr appears to believe was an overly intrusive investigation conducted by overzealous “federal agents and prosecutors.” All of Trump’s lying, his interference, his efforts to publicly discredit the probe, his public assault on Mueller—all of it is excusable, Barr implied, because the probe found “no collusion.” Indeed, Barr writes off Trump’s campaign against the investigation as a perfectly understandable effort to maintain his innocence. His acts were not obstructionary; they were noble. That’s not legal analysis, since righteous anger is not an actual defense against obstruction. It’s political spin. It’s propaganda. It’s running interference for the president who appointed Barr to do precisely this —to exonerate him in public before Americans can read Mueller’s report. It was a galling performance for an audience of one, the president. And Trump must be pleased. In fact, the moment the presser ended, the president posted a Game of Thrones –themed tweet telling the “haters and the radical left Democrats” that it was “Game Over.” Barr’s performance and Trump’s tweet seemed almost coordinated. It is an extraordinary embarrassment for DOJ. The attorney general did what Trump hired him to do. In the process, he has disgraced his office in ways we are only beginning to understand. Barr joined the DOJ too late to quash the investigation. But he is doing his best to shield the Trump from its findings. Thursday morning will be remembered as one of the most shameful chapters in the history of the Department of Justice. Support our journalism

Four loopholes Barr used to protect Trump.,slate.com,William Saletan,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/barr-press-conference-mueller-report-loopholes-protect-trump.html,"What the Mueller Report Says About James Comey’s Firing On Thursday morning, Attorney General William Barr announced the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Russia investigation. In his press conference , Barr extended his role as President Donald Trump’s protector. Following the strategy of his March 24 letter on the Mueller report, Barr constructed loopholes to insulate Trump from charges of collusion and obstruction. Here are four of them. 1. “Illegally participated.” Barr made the following statement:
The special counsel’s investigation also examined Russian efforts to publish stolen emails and documents on the internet. The Special Counsel found that, after the GRU disseminated some of the stolen materials through its own controlled entities, DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, the GRU transferred some of the stolen materials to Wikileaks for publication. Wikileaks then made a series of document dumps. The special counsel also investigated whether any member or affiliate of the Trump campaign encouraged or otherwise played a role in these dissemination efforts. Under applicable law, publication of these types of materials would not be criminal unless the publisher also participated in the underlying hacking conspiracy. Here too, the special counsel’s report did not find that any person associated with the Trump campaign illegally participated in the dissemination of the materials. Notice the shift in Barr’s language. He starts by talking about whether anyone affiliated with Trump “encouraged or otherwise played a role” in the dissemination. But Barr doesn’t answer that question. Instead, he shifts to a different question: whether any Trump affiliates “illegally participated” in the dissemination. The answer, he says, is no, because WikiLeaks’ publication of the hacked material isn’t criminal. This distinction protects Roger Stone, a Trump campaign associate who colluded with WikiLeaks to promote the distribution of the hacked emails. 2. “Conspiracy to violate U.S. law.” Barr continued:
The special counsel investigated a number of “links” or “contacts” between Trump campaign officials and individuals connected with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential campaign. After reviewing those contacts, the special counsel did not find any conspiracy to violate U.S. law involving Russia-linked persons and any persons associated with the Trump campaign. This paragraph covers the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between leaders of the Trump campaign and Russian intermediaries who had explicitly, as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,” offered to give Donald Trump Jr. “official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary … and would be very useful to your father.” This meeting meets the layman’s definition of collusion. But under Barr’s analysis, and ostensibly Mueller’s, it doesn’t constitute a “conspiracy to violate U.S. law.” 3. “Illegally interfere.” In sum, Barr concluded, the investigation “confirmed that the Russian government sponsored efforts to illegally interfere with the 2016 presidential election but did not find that the Trump campaign or other Americans colluded in those schemes.” Here, Barr introduces the word collusion in order to deny that Trump or any of his associates engaged in it. Until this point, Barr carefully used the word conspiracy in order to shield the Trump campaign from culpability for its collusions. But now he shifts to collusion in order to create an appearance that Trump and his associates have been fully exonerated. And to make this claim technically accurate, he inserts the phrase “illegally interfere,” which excludes the Trump Tower meeting and the Stone-WikiLeaks contacts from consideration. 4. “No collusion.” Having shuffled between conspiracy and collusion in order generate an impression that no collusion occurred, Barr then used that claim to argue that Trump’s attempts to obstruct the investigation weren’t obstruction of justice. Trump had a “sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency,” said Barr—never mind that the same could have been said of President Richard Nixon’s Watergate cover-up—and, as Trump “said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion.” Given the absence of collusion, according to Barr, Trump’s efforts to thwart the investigation weren’t criminal. This sleight of hand insulates Trump against the argument that the offenses whose discovery he tried to prevent were, if not prosecutable, impeachable. Barr auditioned for his job by writing a memo outlining how to protect Trump from the investigation. As attorney general, he has used his position to fulfill that mission. He’s a clever lawyer, and his efforts to shield the president pay close attention to legal distinctions. That does not, however, make them honest."
Trump’s Reaction to Mueller’s Appointment: “I’m f--ked. … This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.”,slate.com,Henry Grabar,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/donald-trump-reaction-robert-mueller-report-appointment.html,"What the Mueller Report Says About James Comey’s Firing Here’s what President Donald Trump had to say when, on May 17, 2017, special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to undertake his special investigation into the president’s possible misbehavior: “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I’m fucked.” Those were the president’s first remarks to then–Attorney General Jeff Sessions when Sessions informed Trump of Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s decision to appoint Mueller, according to notes written by Jody Hunt, then Sessions’ chief of staff. The quote is included in the special counsel’s report, released on Thursday:
According to notes written by Hunt , when Sessions told the President that a Special Counsel had been appointed, the President slumped back in his chair and said, “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I’m fucked .” The President became angry and lambasted the Attorney General for his decision to recuse from the investigation , stating, “How could you let this happen, Jeff?” The President said the position of Attorney General was his most important appointment and that Sessions had ” let [him] down ,” contrasting him to Eric Holder and Robert Kennedy. Sessions recalled that the President said to him, “you were supposed to protect me,” or words to that effect. The President returned to the consequences of the appointment and said, “Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency . It takes years and years and I won ‘t be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.” Immediately afterward, at the president’s request, Sessions left to draft a letter of resignation. (He did not resign until November 2018.)"
Mueller Report: Why Congress had it delivered to it on CDs.,slate.com,Aaron Mak,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/mueller-report-congress-cds.html,"What the Mueller Report Says About James Comey’s Firing The Justice Department hand-delivered special counsel Robert Mueller’s 448-page report to Congress at about 11 a.m. Thursday—on CD-ROMs. Why did officials decide to use such an anachronistic storage device? Because it’s still one of the standard methods of delivery. While the use of CDs bemused many in the press, it’s actually not that uncommon for lawmakers to receive sensitive documents on compact discs. “I left the Hill in 2014, and at that time *any* electronic production was unusual. When it occurred, CD-ROM was what we got,” Justin Rood, a director at the Project on Government Oversight who used to work for Sen. Tom Cotton, wrote in an email to Slate. “When I saw that the report was delivered on CD-ROM, I thought it was fairly typical.” Indeed, CBS reported that staffers on the House Judiciary Committee still have access to working CD drives. CD-ROMs are a preferred delivery vessel for classified materials in Congress in part because they have a considerable amount of memory and are largely impervious to tampering. As Wired notes , CDs can also typically hold 700 megabytes of data. The 412-page FISA application to surveil Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, for example, took up only 7.8 megabytes of space, so placing the document on a disc would leave you with plenty of room. Daniel Schuman, the policy director at Demand Progress, told Slate that some congressional offices have access to email networks that are equipped to disseminate classified material and that such documents are occasionally delivered on hard drives as well. “Sometimes information isn’t given to Congress, but you have to go to a secure facility and can read it there,” he added. It was the case for the report that the FBI produced on the sexual assaults allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh last year.

Kevin Durant knows exactly how Patrick Beverley plans to troll him.,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/kevin-durant-patrick-beverley-warriors-clippers.html,"Why Do People Keep Lighting Baseball Fields on Fire? In a confusing and surprising twist, the Golden State Warriors will have to try in the first round of the NBA playoffs. The defending champions blew a 31-point lead on their home court against the No. 8 seed Los Angeles Clippers on Monday night, and the erstwhile warmup series is now knotted at one game apiece. It was the biggest choke job, points-wise, in NBA playoff history. To add injury to insult, center DeMarcus Cousins tore his quadriceps during the game and will likely miss the remainder of the season, however long—or truncated—that may be. For a visual representation of this Warriors-Clippers series, look no further than the duel between Kevin Durant and Patrick Beverley. The Clippers’ 6-foot-1 journeyman guard has been hounding the Warriors’ 7-foot All-Star for two straight games, and the lopsided battle has at times looked like an interpretive dance version of Free Solo , with Durant playing the role of El Capitan. Kevin Durant and Patrick Beverley at Oracle Arena on Monday. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images Beverley’s incessant badgering is akin to back-seat roughhousing during a family road trip—it doesn’t matter who started it because everyone is getting in trouble. Even when the Warriors were up by 15 in the fourth quarter during Game 1, Beverley kept himself attached to Durant and goaded the superstar into an altercation that resulted in dueling ejections. In Game 2, Beverley helped stifle Durant to the tune of 8 field goal attempts and 9 turnovers, and he all but burrowed under the superstar’s skin. — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) April 16, 2019 Both players fouled out of that contest, which, in chess terms, represents yet another successful strategic sacrifice for the Clippers. After the loss, the oft-emo Durant left the locker room without talking to the press, though he spoke at length with reporters during Wednesday’s practice. Kevin Durant goes extremely in depth on the Clippers style of defense, the overhelp, why he won’t get caught up in a 1-on-1 battle with Patrick Beverley pic.twitter.com/nOdmTDY4yi — Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) April 17, 2019 While the approach employed by Beverley and the Clippers might appear to be “annoy Durant until he lashes out,” there is a specific strategy behind everything they do. In the above clip, Durant gives a rundown on his opponents’ gambit and deftly explains how he intends to overcome it. First, he identifies that the Clippers are “ top-locking ” Golden State’s sharpshooters, which means the off-ball defenders are preventing them from getting behind the 3-point line. He then elaborates on what, exactly, Beverley is trying to accomplish.
I got a pest Patrick Beverley who’s up underneath me, who I could definitely shoot over the top and score every time if it’s a 1-on-1 situation. But we’ve got a guy that’s dropping and helping and then we got another guy that’s just sitting on me waiting on me to dribble the basketball. If I put the basketball on the floor I can probably make 43 percent of my shots if I shoot them like that, but that’s not really going to do nothing for us for the outcome of the game because we’ve got a nice flow. The clip went semi-viral, and not because Durant called the Clippers’ schemes a “gimmick defense.” Durant has been prickly with the press all year, especially when asked about the looming free agency period and his heavily rumored exit from the Warriors this summer. Durant’s future travel plans have defined Golden State’s season, even as the team prepares to leave Oakland to make its own move to a new arena in San Francisco. Durant’s candid response on Wednesday was a reminder that he can be a great interview when he wants to be, though those moments have become increasingly rare during his Warriors tenure. Fittingly, Durant’s analysis was spurred on by the fact that Beverley and the Clippers tried to get in his head. Durant is the most self-conscious star in the league , and he inhabits that particular space with ascetic hermeticism. While Beverley’s campaign of annoyance has yielded on-court results, Durant’s staid off-court response serves as a reminder that he was forged in a fire of perceived slights. This is a man who reportedly used a burner account to defend himself from Twitter trolls and got into arguments with a teenager on Instagram . If his calm response indicates anything, it’s that he knows he’s in a battle he can actually win—and he’s happy to provide details about how, exactly, he plans to win it. "

"Trump tried to interfere with Mueller, but his aides didn't follow orders.",slate.com,Henry Grabar,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-obstruction-mueller-report-sessions-mcgahn-lewandowski.html,"What the Mueller Report Says About Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump President Donald Trump was “mostly unsuccessful” in interfering with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, according to the redacted version of the Mueller report released on Thursday, but it wasn’t for lack of trying. Here’s the crux of it, from Page 158 of the report, which concerns the president’s efforts to pressure FBI Director James Comey, White House Counsel Don McGahn, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, and senior White House official Rick Dearborn:
The President‘s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn’s prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President’s order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President‘s message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President’s direction to have the Special Counsel removed, despite the President’s multiple demands that he do so. Consistent with that pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the President’s aides and associates beyond those already filed. The report includes juicy details on each of those incidents. For example, while we knew Trump directed White House Counsel Don McGahn to tell Rod Rosenstein to fire Mueller, we didn’t know the president had called McGahn at home to pressure him. McGahn told his chief of staff Annie Donaldson that the president called at least twice and at one point asked, “Have you done it?” McGahn told the president’s then–chief of staff Reince Priebus that Trump had asked him to “do crazy shit.” In the case of Lewandowski, the president twice tried to get him to pass notes to Jeff Sessions to limit the scope of the investigation. Trump dictated this paragraph to Lewandowski, telling him that the attorney general should read it out loud:
I know that I recused myself from certain things having to do with specific areas. But our POTUS … is being treated very unfairly. He shouldn’t have a Special Prosecutor/Counsel b/c he hasn’t done anything wrong. I was on the campaign w/ him for nine months, there were no Russians involved with him. I know it for a fact b/c I was there. He didn’t do anything wrong except he ran the greatest campaign in American history. Very cool, very legal, definitely sounds like something the head of the Department of Justice would say of his own volition. Lewandowski did not pass those directions onto Sessions. This is all great news for the president’s aides—as Mueller notes at the bottom of the long blockquote above, “the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the President’s aides and associates beyond those already filed.” As for the question of obstruction by the president himself, Mueller leaves that issue to Congress.

Mueller Report details Donald Trump Jr.’s Twitter DMs with WikiLeaks.,slate.com,April Glaser,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/mueller-report-donald-trump-jr-wikileaks-twitter-hacking.html,"How a Futurist Sees AOC’s Video “A Message From the Future” The redacted version of the Muller report released Thursday surfaces new details about the correspondence between WikiLeaks and Donald Trump Jr. before the 2016 election. In November 2017, we learned that Trump’s eldest son had exchanged direct messages with the WikiLeaks Twitter account in September 2016, less than two months before Election Day. In those messages, the WikiLeaks account, which is widely suspected to have been primarily operated by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, offered Trump’s son a “guessed” password to an “anti-Trump site putintrump.org that is about to launch.” According to the Mueller report, that password was provided to WikiLeaks by a man named Jason Fishbein, a detail that was previously unknown. A footnote in the report details that Fishbein obtained the password from someone in a chat room for discussing U.S. politics. Fishbein then sent a direct message to WikiLeaks with the login credentials, which were then passed on to Trump Jr. Hours later, Trump Jr. sent an email to senior campaign officials admitting that he used the “guessed” password to access the site. “I tried the password and it works,” he wrote. That could be an admission that he violated a federal criminal hacking law called the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which makes it illegal to access a computer using a stolen password without authorization. WikiLeaks doesn’t appear to have had authorization to access the site, and the person behind the account told Trump Jr. that the password he provided was guessed, which implies pretty clearly that the then-candidate’s son knew he was using a key he wasn’t supposed to have. The email where Trump Jr. admits that he accessed a website knowingly using a hacked password was first published in a report from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in 2018. In that email, Trump Jr. goes on to say that he attached screenshots of an About page of the site, thereby demonstrating in pretty clear terms that he obtained information off the site after using a password he wasn’t authorized to use. Orin Kerr, a law professor specializing in computer crime at the University of Southern California, wrote on the blog Lawfare that that may be enough to make his access of the site a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. This wouldn’t be Assange’s first time brushing shoulders with potential violations of federal criminal hacking law. Last week, when he was arrested by British police after spending seven years hiding out in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on charges of skipping bail, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia unsealed an indictment charging Assange with conspiring to commit computer crime by helping former Army intelligence officer Chelsea Manning crack a password to a government computer. While it’s not yet clear that Assange will ever be brought back to the U.S. to face these charges, it is clear that Assange isn’t shy about encouraging people to break password locks to hack into computers and websites they’re not supposed to access. The Twitter handle provided for Jason Fishbein in the Mueller report links to a person who claims to be in “edtech marketing,” but I found another account that’s different by one character that belongs to someone with the same name who appears to be a fan of WikiLeaks and a defender of Assange. I reached out to both to ask if they’re at all affiliated with the person named in the report and will update this story if I learn more. About two weeks after WikiLeaks first messaged Trump Jr., it sent another message to the then-candidate’s son asking for help sharing a link to a website “alleging candidate Clinton had advocated using a drone to target Julian Assange,” the Mueller report reads. A little over a week later, WikiLeaks wrote to Trump Jr. again to “strongly suggest your dad tweets this link if he mentions us wlsearch.tk.” Trump Jr. apparently got the message. Two days later, he tweeted the link. For those who have the time to read about all the corruption and hypocrisy all the @wikileaks emails are right here: https://t.co/SGcEeM9rCS "
Robert Mueller let Donald Trump Jr. off the hook too easily.,slate.com,Richard L. Hasen,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/donald-trump-jr-mueller-report-campaign-finance.html,"The Mueller Report Is an Irrefutable Case That Trump Is Unfit for Office Robert Mueller let Donald Trump Jr. off the hook too easily for potential campaign finance violations that arose from the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower with Russian operatives. Mueller’s questionable exercise of prosecutorial discretion is bad news for how campaigns and foreign entities might conduct themselves in the run-up to the 2020 elections. Like many others, I am still poring over Mueller’s 448-page partially redacted report . My initial general impression of Volume 1—the part dealing with Russian interference in the 2016 elections and the connections between Trump—is that Mueller and his team did a thorough and fair job in investigating what happened and in describing the facts. But on the potential campaign finance violations, Mueller fell short in numerous ways. I have described the circumstances of that Trump Tower meeting before: During the 2016 presidential campaign, the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. got an email from his friend Rob Goldstone stating that the “Crown prosecutor of Russia” had “offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.” This “high level and sensitive information” was being presented as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. replied almost immediately: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.” The subsequent meeting, held on June 9, 2016, included Trump Jr.; Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort; the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner; Goldstone; and a number of Russians connected with the Russian government. Federal law makes it a potential crime for any person to “solicit” (that is, expressly or impliedly ask for ) the contribution of “anything of value” from a foreign citizen. The offer of such opposition research qualifies as something of value for these purposes, a point the special counsel acknowledged based on prior cases and Federal Election Commission rulings. We now know the special counsel considered whether Trump Jr. and Manafort committed such a crime before ultimately declining to prosecute. We also now know that Mueller made some key errors during that decision-making process. To begin with, the special counsel’s report says that Trump Jr. “declined to be voluntarily interviewed” about the meeting. The special counsel should have called Trump Jr. before the grand jury, as he did with other witnesses. It seems likely that he declined to do so as not to incur the wrath of the president. Trump Jr.’s grand jury testimony would have been especially important given one of the key reasons Mueller declined to prosecute the president’s son for this crime: lack of willfulness. In order for a campaign finance violation to constitute a criminal offense (rather than a civil problem handled with fines by the Federal Election Commission), one must act willfully. Willfulness is a question of mental state. Getting Trump Jr. before a grand jury would have been a great way to get at his mental state, because he would have been testifying under the risk of perjury. This was a huge missed opportunity for Mueller. Mueller made some other questionable choices. While Trump Jr. could have been charged with illegally coordinating with the Russians to make an illegal foreign expenditure, Mueller describes the law defining coordination as too uncertain. In fact, as Common Cause’s Paul S. Ryan explains in this thread , there is both a federal statute and case law defining the term, and Trump Jr.’s conduct seems to fall within it. Mueller also made the ridiculous argument that it is possible Russian “dirt” on Clinton could have been worth less than $25,000, the threshold to punish Trump Jr.’s cooperation as a felony. Really? Further, Mueller said that a Trump Jr. prosecution would have raised “First Amendment questions” and “could have implications beyond the foreign-source ban.” To begin with, a First Amendment defense of Trump Jr. is bogus. As I explained in Slate, the main First Amendment argument is that a ban on soliciting foreign political contributions is overly broad and could apply any time a foreign individual gives any information to a political campaign. But Trump Jr. was a major campaign official meeting with representatives from a foreign government that were offering “dirt” on the campaign’s opponent. As I wrote, “To let someone off the hook who solicited ‘very high level and sensitive information’ from a hostile government because there may be cases in which information from a foreign source does not raise the same danger to our national security and right of self-government is to turn the First Amendment into a tool to kill American democracy.” Further, even if Mueller believed there were First Amendment questions in play, he should have left that for the courts to decide given the strong national security interests at stake here. Mueller offered no First Amendment argument in his report. He merely flagged the issue and never provided any analysis to back up the First Amendment claim. I’m afraid that this flagging of the issue does more harm than good. Mueller has now given campaigns credible reason to believe they can accept help from foreign governments because they may have a constitutional right to do so. That’s even more troubling for what it says about 2020 than what it says about 2016. Support our journalism

"Trump 2020’s Mueller report response: Obama did it, investigate him and the others too.",slate.com,Josh Voorhees,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-2020-mueller-report-response-obama-did-it-duh.html,"What the Mueller Report Says About Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump It remains an open question how special counsel Robert Mueller’s report will fit into the plans of the nearly 20 Democrats running for president. Most spent the early days of their 2020 campaigns trying to steer the conversation away from collusion and impeachment and toward issues like health care and the economy—a strategy of restraint that appeared smart in light of Attorney General William Barr’s initial summary late last month. The White House hopefuls could take a more aggressive approach now that the public has seen the redacted version of the full report—and all the juicy and potentially damning details inside —or they may stay the course. Time will tell. We will not, however, have to wait to see how team Trump tries to spin it to help the president’s reelection effort. Barr kicked things off Thursday with a pre-release press conference at which the nation’s top prosecutor acted like the president’s personal defense attorney . And the Trump campaign then took things considerably further in the hours following the release, suggesting that it was time to “investigate the investigators”—a group that apparently includes both those congressional Democrats currently investigating Trump and those officials who worked in the FBI and Justice Department under President Barack Obama. First up was Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, who released a statement that falsely claimed his boss had been “fully and completely exonerated” by the report:
President Trump has been fully and completely exonerated yet again. Now the tables have turned, and it’s time to investigate the liars who instigated this sham investigation into President Trump, motivated by political retribution and based on no evidence whatsoever. There is simply no denying that ‘spying did occur’ on the Trump campaign during the 2016 election, as Attorney General Barr himself noted in testimony before Congress. Barr went on to testify that there was a ‘failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon [of the FBI] … [and] I feel I have an obligation to make sure that government power is not abused.’ Now that the collusion and obstruction conspiracy theories have been exposed for the pathetic hoaxes they always were, the Obama-era DOJ and FBI must answer for their misdeeds and the scam that they perpetrated against the American people. Justice will be served. And then came the campaign video, which included a montage of Democratic lawmakers like Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, as well as news coverage of last months’ Barr memo: None of this is new. Trump has been trying to blame Obama for the Russian interference for more than a year now , and he called for Schiff to resign last month. Still, it’s the latest evidence that the president’s campaign has no interest in talking about all the things Mueller and his team found, only what they didn’t. "

Ukraine GOP platform change: The Mueller report has some new details on one of the most suspicious moments o f the trump campaign.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/ukraine-gop-platform-gordon.html,"The Clearest Case of Trump’s Corruption in the Mueller Report Throughout the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, questions have swirled around an odd change the campaign pushed for in the Republican platform at the party’s 2016 convention in Cleveland. As the Washington Post originally reported shortly after the convention, Trump campaign representatives pushed to water down language in the platform about “providing lethal defensive weapons” to the government of Ukraine for its fight against pro-Russian separatists. Given then–campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s financial ties to pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, that raised some eyebrows. Was the platform move part of a quid pro quo, or a demonstration of good faith to Trump’s allies in Moscow? On this particular question, the just-released Mueller report is mostly good news for Trump. Investigators found no evidence that the president ordered or was even aware of the change to the platform language. But it does highlight the degree to which Trumpworld officials with questionable motives were engaged in freelance policymaking during this period. The report mostly confirms what has been reported by the Post and later the Daily Beast about the incident. At a meeting of the national security platform subcommittee shortly before the convention, on July 11, 2016, Diana Denman, a Ted Cruz–supporting delegate, submitted an amendment to the platform denouncing Russian military aggression in Ukraine and calling for the provision of lethal weapons, a step the Obama administration was then opposing. J.D. Gordon, a former Pentagon spokesman who was then a national security adviser to the Trump campaign and attended the meeting as a non-voting observer, flagged the amendment, saying he did not believe it corresponded with Trump’s views on Russia and Ukraine. Denman says Gordon told her during the meeting that he was on the phone with Trump himself, but she was skeptical of this claim, and Gordon denies ever making it. Trump told the Mueller team he did not speak with Gordon about the matter, though phone records show Gordon called Jeff Sessions’ office that day. Gordon does say he talked to senior Trump advisers Rick Dearborn and John Mashburn, and here’s where things get odd: Gordon says the two backed him up, but Mashburn remembers telling Gordon that Trump hadn’t taken a stand on the issue and that the campaign shouldn’t interfere. With this one notable exception, Trump campaign observers mostly held back and didn’t offer any substantive input during the platform-drafting process. In the end, the language in the amendment was softened to “appropriate assistance,” which led Mashburn to believe, as the Mueller report puts it, that “Gordon had violated Mashburn’s directive not to intervene.” Then-campaign co-chair Sam Clovis also told investigators that he was surprised by the change and did not believe it accorded with Trump’s views. (In fairness, Trump’s stated views on Ukraine, at that time, were a little vague and hard to parse .) So was Gordon just acting on his own? This wasn’t his only activity during the convention that the report discusses. Gordon also spoke briefly with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at a conference held the week of the convention in Cleveland. (You may recall this was also the conference where Kislyak spoke to Sessions.) Gordon and the ambassador, along with several other diplomats, also sat together at dinner that night and spoke about improving U.S.-Russia relations. (Gordon remembers the conversation lasting just three to five minutes. Quick dinner!) It should be noted this happened after Gordon advocated the platform change. The Washington Post has also reported that in the months prior to the election—when Gordon had left the campaign but anticipated being offered a job on Trump’s transition team—he socialized with the Russian gun rights activist Maria Butina, who has since been charged by the U.S. with working as an unregistered agent of the Kremlin. According to documents and testimony from the Senate Intelligence Committee, the two exchanged a number of emails, including invitations from Gordon to Butina to attend his birthday party and a Styx concert. The party platform was always an odd place for the Trump team to pick a fight on this or any issue. Its language is not binding, and it’s not as if Trump has ever been reluctant to buck GOP orthodoxy. In the end, the Trump administration did end up selling lethal anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, though reportedly over the president’s personal reluctance . Mueller’s investigation into this odd incident finds no evidence that Trump was acting on Russia’s behalf, though perhaps some people working for him thought they should be."

HBO not amused by Trump's Mueller report-Game of Thrones tweet.,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/trump-game-of-thrones-meme-hbo-responds.html,"The Stormy Story of Three Kings , the Only Great Movie About the Gulf War It’s happening again: Donald Trump is tweeting personalized Game of Thrones memes. In response to Thursday morning’s press conference about the Mueller report , the president posted an image inspired by the popular HBO series with text that reads: “No collusion. No obstruction. For the haters and the radical left Democrats—Game Over.” The message was sent prior to the release of the actual report, though once a redacted version did become available , Trump’s campaign announced that it “fully and completely” exonerated the president. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 18, 2019 HBO wasn’t too happy about the president borrowing its distinctive font. “Though we can understand the enthusiasm for Game of Thrones now that the final season has arrived, we still prefer our intellectual property not be used for political purposes,” the network said in a statement to Slate. It isn’t the first time HBO has been rankled by Trump’s use of its show, either. In November, after the president posted a similar “Sanctions are coming” tweet riffing on Game of Thrones ’ popular tagline, HBO responded, “We were not aware of this messaging and would prefer our trademark not be misappropriated for political purposes” and tweeted out , “How do you say trademark misuse in Dothraki?” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2018 If it seems strange that, in response to probes into his own conduct, Trump would opt to invoke one of the bloodiest and politically manipulative series on television—does it really?

Redactions: The Mueller report is hardly the first time officials have gone heavy on the black pen.,slate.com,Fred Kaplan,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-redactions-pentagon-papers.html,"Why Elizabeth Warren Wants the House to Start Impeachment Proceedings Against Trump Nearly half the pages in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report —163 out of a total 381 pages of text—contain passages that Attorney General William Barr has blacked out. In some cases, the redactions cover just a few words or a name; in many cases, though, whole paragraphs or entire pages are deleted. Most of the deletions were made for one of two reasons: “Investigative Techniques” (facts that, if uncensored, would reveal intelligence sources or methods) and “Harm to Ongoing Matter” (facts pertaining to grand jury probes or upcoming trials). In principle, these are legitimate reasons for redacting government documents. But two points need to be made. First, because some of the “ongoing matter” concerns people indicted and facing trial as a result of the Mueller investigation, the redactions prevent us from assessing the nature and scope of the relationship between Russia and President Donald Trump’s campaign. For instance, in a section titled “Trump Campaign and the Dissemination of Hacked Materials” (Volume I, pages 51–58), almost the entire text is blacked out. The same is true for most passages concerning Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort (for instance, Vol. I, page 143). See also a section titled “Russian Hacking and Dumping Operations,” especially a subsection whose title is redacted (“Charging Decision as to [Harmful to Ongoing Matter],” Vol. I, pages 176–79). Another multipage blackout is labeled “Constitutional Considerations” (Vol. I, pages 190–91). A passage recounting Trump discussing a pardon for Manafort is followed by two fully redacted pages (Vol. II, pages 128–30). We may never know what’s in those redacted passages of the Mueller report. The second point that needs to be made about redactions is that they often have little or dubious basis. Thursday morning, in anticipation of the Mueller report’s release, the National Security Archive —a private research organization at George Washington University—published 10 examples of bizarre redactions from the thousands of Freedom of Information Act suits it has filed over the years. In some cases, redactions—or the removal of redactions—were ordered for obvious political reasons. But often, the government gatekeepers have taken out the black pen because there are no firm standards on what should and should not be made public. When in doubt, officials—often to protect their careers—opt for caution, not transparency. In many cases, different officials have different standards or make different decisions. The result is rampant overclassification. For instance, the archive’s report displays a 1984 State Department document on Geneva Convention violations in Rwanda, as it was marked up in four separate declassifications between 2001 and 2012. Each version redacts certain passages—but the passages are different in each one: Words that are clear and open in one version are blacked out in another, and vice versa. All four reviewers justified the deletions for reasons of “national security.” In fact, they were for reasons of individual judgment. Back in 2011, the U.S. government, finally, formally declassified the Pentagon Papers, the top-secret history of the Vietnam War that Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara had ordered way back in 1967. Daniel Ellsberg leaked the report in 1971, and the New York Times and several other newspapers famously reprinted huge chunks of it that same year. Sen. Mike Gravel, a Democrat from Alaska, then entered the full report into the Congressional Record, after which Beacon Press published it in four volumes. And yet, the government’s official public version redacted 11 words —even though the complete report, including those 11 words, had been available to the world for the previous 40 years. We may never know what’s in those redacted passages of the Mueller report. Whether we should know—and how it might alter our view of its conclusions—is a vital question. Support our journalism

The site’s new BeeSexual channel features videos of bees—like, actual bees, that’s not a euphemism—with titles such as “Pollen squirter gets raided by exotic explorer” and “Mature natural gets plowed by worker bee.” For the next month, Pornhub will donate to Operation Honey Bee and The Center for Honeybee Research according to how many views the videos, which feature voiceover commentary by actual porn stars, receive. BeeSexual is a very silly initiative that benefits a worthy cause, but it also taps into a weird cultural obsession: the horniness surrounding bees. We literally use the phrase “ the birds and the bees ” as a euphemism for sex, with the process of pollination acting as a convenient metaphor for squeamish parents who need to explain it to their kids. And that’s not even about sex between bees, which is bizarre in its own right: Male drones basically lose their reproductive organ and die after mating. Then there’s also the fetish known as Melissaphilia , human sexual attraction to bees, which hasn’t been studied or documented enough to know if it’s even real. What is real, however, is Bee Movie , the Dreamworks animated feature that launched a thousand memes , thanks in part to the relationship between the main characters, a human woman and a nonconformist bee named Barry. “It was never going to be sexual or anything like that. It was purely this friendship… maybe in Barry’s mind he thought… but it was never going to be that,” director Steve Hickner told the New Statesman . “Often we would lose sight of those characters in the room. They would just be Barry and Vanessa, and we would write this dialogue for Barry and Vanessa, and read it over and have to remind ourselves, well, this is a tiny bee saying this, and the tiny bee is fighting with her boyfriend, so let’s dial it back to friend, and make it less romantic, because it’s getting weird.” Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

Mueller report vs. Barr's summary: a line-by-line comparison of three key passages.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-barr-summary-comparison-key-passages.html,"The Clearest Case of Trump’s Corruption in the Mueller Report Reporters and other interested parties are still reading through the 448-page Mueller report for new and revelatory information, but one thing was quickly apparent: Attorney General William Barr’s depiction of the report in his written summary last month and his address Thursday morning didn’t give the full story. If there’s one conclusion you would come away with after Barr’s address this morning , it’s that there was no collusion . Barr conceded that, yes, Mueller found that Russians had unlawfully sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 election, and yes, Trump’s campaign likely benefited from these efforts, but Barr maintained that Mueller had found no evidence of any kind of collusion by anyone . Here’s what he said, in a line that he had already quoted in his earlier written report:
As you will see, the special counsel’s report states that his “investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” But here’s the full sentence in the report (emphasis ours):
Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts , the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. Cutting off the beginning of the sentence doesn’t change the end result. But on its own, Barr’s sentence makes the whole thing seem so simple, when that’s far from the reality revealed in the report. Even if there was no proof of coordination, there was still uncomfortable behavior, still a Don Jr. meeting with Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton, still campaign officials with murky connections to states with political aims very much at odds with America’s. That’s a sense you get better from the fuller sentence, reminding the reader of just how the Trump campaign stood to gain from Russian meddling. Here’s another example, Barr’s next quote from his address Thursday:
Indeed, as the report states, “[t]he investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA’s interference operation.” Put another way, the special counsel found no “collusion” by any Americans in the IRA’s illegal activity. But here’s the full version from the report:
By early to mid-2016, [Internet Research Agency] operations included supporting the Trump Campaign and disparaging candidate Hillary Clinton. The IRA made various expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Some IRA employees, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated electronically with individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities, including the staging of political rallies. The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA’s interference operation. Again, the full passage shows that there was nothing cut and dry about the situation. And a third example, in Barr’s written summary from March, shows the attorney general’s cherry-picking at its most brazen:
In making this determination [that there was no obstruction-of-justice offense], we noted that the special counsel recognized that “the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,” and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the president’s intent with respect to obstruction. Here, the full context:
In this investigation, the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. But the evidence does point to a range of other possible personal motives animating the President’s conduct. These include concerns that continued investigation would call into question the legitimacy of his election and potential uncertainty about whether certain events—such as advance notice of WikiLeaks’s release of hacked information or the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians—could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family. While Barr didn’t misquote the Mueller report, he did pluck out lines that failed to give the full, nuanced picture of the report’s analysis. There’s a reason critics have been condemning Barr for seeming to abandon his objectivity in order to defend Trump. As Jeremy Stahl pointed out for Slate, the report does refute coordination between Trump’s campaign and Russian agents to some extent, but it also “seemed to include evidence of a lot of collusion-adjacent activities by those in Trump’s orbit.” And as Mark Joseph Stern argued in Slate , the report did make a case for obstruction—as much as Mueller realistically could, given the limits of his power. But you wouldn’t know that from Barr’s comments, clipped as they are."

Mueller Report: Trump Repeatedly Asked Campaign Associates to Find Clinton’s Deleted Emails,slate.com,Aaron Mak,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-trump-campaign-hillary-clinton-emails.html,"There Might Be More Mueller-Related Prosecutions After All During a press conference in Florida on July 17, 2016, Donald Trump asked for some help finding emails that Hillary Clinton had supposedly deleted from her private email account. “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” he said . “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.” That same day, Russian hackers made their first attempt to break into Clinton’s servers. Last month, Trump referred to those remarks as “sarcastic” and “a joke” during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, released on Thursday, puts this characterization into question. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn told investigators that Trump repeatedly asked people affiliated with his presidential campaign to find the emails. Flynn claims that he undertook an effort to retrieve the emails at Trump’s request. He contacted Barbara Ledeen, a Senate staffer, and Peter Smith, an investment adviser involved in Republican politics. Ledeen had actually been searching for the emails herself since 2015. She sent Smith a 15-page proposal at the end of that year:
The proposal called for a three-phase approach. The first two phases consisted of open-source analysis. The third phase consisted of checking with certain intelligence sources “that have access through liaison work with various foreign services” to determine if any of those services had gotten to the server. The proposal noted, “Even if a single email was recovered and the providence [sic] of that email was a foreign service, it would be catastrophic to the Clinton campaign[.]” Smith forwarded the proposal to his colleagues but declined to collaborate with Ledeen because he didn’t think the effort was viable. However, weeks after Trump made the request in 2016 to track down the emails, Smith decided to launch his own search effort:
[Smith] created a company, raised tens of thousands of dollars, and recruited security experts and business associates. Smith made claims to others involved in the effort (and those from whom he sought funding) that he was in contact with hackers with “ties and affiliations to Russia” who had access to the emails, and that his efforts were coordinated with the Trump Campaign. In August, Smith sent an update to several people, including Trump campaign co-chair Sam Clovis, claiming that he had been in “sensitive meetings” in D.C. with groups who were looking into Clinton’s server. He noted that hackers had been able to gain access and were planning to release the material ahead of the election. The next month, Smith had a business associate establish KLS Research LLC, partly to manage the money he’d raised to find the emails. Investigators determined that KLS received more than $30,000 during the campaign. In an effort to recruit security experts for KLS, Smith claimed that he was coordinating with campaign officials such as Flynn, Clovis, Steve Bannon, and Kellyanne Conway. However, the investigation only found proof of contact with Flynn and Clovis. At around the same time, Smith and Ledeen got back in contact to discuss their search efforts. Leeden claimed to have found a trove of Clinton’s emails on the deep web. Blackwater founder Erik Prince, brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, provided money to hire a tech expert to analyze the trove. The expert determined that the emails were inauthentic. Despite Smith’s subsequent claims to have had insight into WikiLeaks and contact with the Russian hackers, investigators could not establish that this was the case:
Associates and security experts who worked with Smith on the initiative did not believe that Smith was in contact with Russian hackers and were aware of no such connection. The investigation did not establish that Smith was in contact with Russian hackers or that Smith, Ledeen, or other individuals in touch with the Trump Campaign ultimately obtained the deleted Clinton emails. The report notes, though, that Smith appears to have obtained material from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s inbox before WikiLeaks released it:
A backup of Smith’s computer contained two files that had been downloaded from WikiLeaks and that were originally attached to emails received by John Podesta. The files on Smith’s computer had creation dates of October 2, 2016, which was prior to the date of their release by WikiLeaks. Forensic examination, however, established that the creation date did not reflect when the files were downloaded to Smith ‘s computer. … The investigation did not otherwise identify evidence that Smith obtained the files before their release by WikiLeaks. Smith was found dead in 2017 . His death was ruled a suicide."

Robert Mueller gave us everything we need to know.,slate.com,Dahlia Lithwick,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-gives-us-everything-we-need-to-know.html,"Trump Tweet Claiming Millions Killed in Sri Lanka Bombings Stays Up for 20 Minutes It has been said that there are two types of fiction writers, those who can show us entirely new worlds and those who tell us again what we already know. Robert Mueller is quite obviously the latter. What his report, released Thursday, does, irrefutably and in eye-scraping detail, is tell us what we already know. Some may find this frustrating—in many people’s eyes, Mueller went right up to the brink of finding serious criminal misconduct and then blinked, or punted, or declined to interview the president. But knowing, as he must have known, that anything short of a smoking gun, and perhaps even a smoking gun , would be met with cries of “no collusion” and “total exoneration,” Mueller took a slightly different approach. Rather than make specific recommendations of what comes next, he laid out the case and left it to Congress to do the work that he could not, for all sorts of constitutional and structural reasons, complete himself . And Mueller’s efforts managed to do one important thing: They cement the story. They paint a picture. We now have the montage. After two years without facts, we now have facts. Thus far the White House and Trump boosters haven’t disputed the facts. As we pored over the 448-page report, the quote that became the very first hot take of the day was that the president, upon learning that Mueller had been appointed to investigate, shouted, “I’m fucked.” He declared that his presidency was over. The reason this matters is that it cements in the collective consciousness what everyone already knew—that the president wanted this probe ended and knew it was an existential risk to his presidency. What follows in the rest of the report is a highlights reel of things even the most casual observer already knew, at some level, regardless of ideology or politics. The Russians tried to steal the election. Some members of his campaign were happy to help. The president wanted to protect Michael Flynn. The president wanted to kill the special counsel investigation. The president materially and significantly tampered with witnesses to that investigation. The president lied and told others to lie. None of this was ever really in dispute. Almost everything about the president’s impetuousness and vindictiveness and malevolence was known, even before the election, because it’s been on full display, to all of us, for years. What Mueller has done is hold up a mirror to the presidency and shown us what was happening. Sometimes, it was happening on live television or Twitter, and sometimes it was coming out by way of superb reporting by journalists. But almost all of it was entirely known. After two years without facts, we now have facts. Thus far the White House and Trump boosters haven’t disputed the facts. What they say is “no collusion,” because that’s what they were going to say, no matter what. But the facts in this movie are devastating. They paint a picture of Trump campaign members helping Russia steal an election, with polling data and secret meetings, and of a lawless and King Lear–like Trump trying desperately to obscure what was really happening. Mueller may not have taken the American public anywhere specific on questions of law. But he sure as hell took us all to the same place on the question of reality. And the facts that the American public—at least those who don’t have an intravenous hookup to Tucker Carlson’s worldview—are seeing today, whether by way of quotes, or hot takes, or television punditry, is a walk down the well-trod lane of how Trump operates. He lies. He tells others to lie. He fires people. He threatens. He demands loyalty. In some ways, I’m enjoying this movie more this time around precisely because, as 448-page encapsulations of all the facts I thought I’d become insensible to go, this is a hell of a read. And in its own pointillist and nuanced way, that story makes the conclusions of law somewhat less frustrating. It’s as if Mueller was just saying, “You all know this happened and continues to happen. Now you decide what to do about it.” Congress now has its road map, should it decide to pursue inquiries into the matters about which Mueller could not make conclusions. Despite what Attorney General William Barr has asserted, Mueller makes it very clear that Congress is entitled to act on this report. But despite the heavy lawyering and the very lawyerly parsing, I actually read the Mueller report as a fundamentally political document as much as a legal one. It’s a delineation, chapter and verse, of how Trump has conducted himself in office, and for anyone who believes that the president should not be above the law, this is a damning report of presidential lawlessness . It’s lawlessness sometimes erased by staff, lawlessness sometimes declined by underlings, lawlessness sometimes erased by cluelessness and stupidity, lawlessness sometimes elided by technical definitions. But while Mueller may have avoided making explicit legal conclusions about criminality, he has sealed into amber a story that we all needed to hear. The fact that elites are arguing about the mental states required for criminal obstruction doesn’t change the fact that the American public is seeing, yet again, that Donald Trump is exactly who he presents himself to be. For some proportion of the public, that means today confirms, once again, that the president is a valorous and heroic leader, triumphing against all odds. Barr had them at his first claims, in announcing the conclusions of the report, that the president feels he has been treated very unfairly . But for Americans who are weary of Donald Trump, bored of the lies, fatigued by the ugliness and rancor, there is nothing good about this report, which essentially says, “This guy is appalling, I can’t say whether he’s a criminal.” Congress needs to do its job now and follow where Mueller has led. But the American public can no longer claim that nothing has happened. Mueller has shown us what is true. Nobody in the White House has disputed it. We can decide we’re fine with it or that we are not fine with it. That’s a political question, not a legal one. I think that may be what needed to happen all along. Support our journalism

"My dog is camera-shy, hates having his photo taken: pet advice from Beast Mode.",slate.com,Nick Greene,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/dog-hates-photos-phones-camera-shy.html,"My Cranky Old Dog Has No Friends. Is That a Problem? I have two dogs, both from the same shelter. One is an absolute ham for the camera. She will sit down nicely and wait to hear the click and the ensuing praise. The other is much more fearful when someone points a camera or phone in his general direction. It amazes me that the shelter was even able to get a photo to put on its website for prospective adopters. Any time he notices a camera pointed his way, he walks off with his head and tail down and sits in his crate. I don’t want him living in fear of something many people have in their pockets or purses. How can I get him used to seeing what’s ultimately a harmless object? —Pensive Puparazzi Dear Pensive Puparazzi, Dogs are ignorant muses. They may not understand the concept of photography, but that can’t stop them from being the medium’s greatest subjects. My dog Ruby doesn’t know the first thing about shutter speed or aperture, yet she still manages to bring some smoldering looks when it’s go time. Nick Greene Cynics will see my selection of your question as an excuse to post a photo of my own dog, to which I say: Here’s another picture of Ruby. Nick Greene Your dog shares this trait with some of America’s finest novelists. There is no shame in being camera-shy, and your dog shares this trait with some of America’s finest novelists. After a CNN crew captured footage of Thomas Pynchon in 1997, the author called the network to complain . “Let me be unambiguous: I prefer not to be photographed,” he said. Your dog has the same right, and Pynchon would argue that he is perfectly normal in this regard. “My belief is that recluse is a code word generated by journalists,” he said, “meaning, ‘doesn’t like to talk to reporters.’ ” But, unlike Pynchon, your pooch doesn’t feel crushed by the mechanisms of media and fame. He’s simply scared of the camera, though he doesn’t have to be. To help with your issue, I contacted Ellen Shershow , an Oakland, California–based photographer who specializes in canine portraiture. “It sounds like a small thing, but having patience is the most important thing you can possibly do,” she tells me. “It’s the best tool in your toolkit.” Shershow says she always informs her clients that she doesn’t charge by the hour, as the process of luring a shy dog out of its shell can drag on. “I had a little chihuahua in my studio, and she was terrified of the camera,” she recalls. “She hid under my desk for 45 minutes. Finally, I took a very soft dog treat and I mushed it all over my camera, put the camera next to her, and just walked away. She was able to walk out on her own time, sniff the camera, and then lick it down. The camera itself became like a giver of treats. After that, she wasn’t scared anymore. She was practically posing for the camera.” To photograph something is to act strangely toward it. Your dog reacts to this, and because you have the camera out, you may be exacerbating his sense that something is amiss. Shershow recommends having a friend take the photos while you sit near your dog or have him on your lap. “I’ll keep experimenting until I find out what’s making it easier for them,” she says, noting that some dogs prefer to have their humans in their sightlines during photo shoots. He may not turn into a cover model instantaneously, but with a little patience, your dog will learn that the camera won’t hurt him. Just don’t go publishing those photos all over the place. Like Pynchon, he has a mystique to maintain. "
"Mueller report is bad for Trump, but no impeachment.",slate.com,Jim Newell,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-trump-bad-impeachment-no.html,"The Clearest Case of Trump’s Corruption in the Mueller Report Robert Mueller’s report, which details 10 potential instances of obstruction of justice by Donald Trump, is unsurprisingly meatier than Attorney General William Barr let on in his initial summary . As my colleague Mark Joseph Stern writes , it can even be read as an impeachment referral to Congress. House Democrats certainly welcomed it as such. “The Special Counsel made clear that he did not exonerate the President,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a Thursday statement. “The responsibility now falls to Congress to hold the President accountable for his actions.” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, similarly, said in a statement that “the Special Counsel concludes that Congress must make a determination regarding obstruction of justice, unable to make such a determination himself.” But then later, speaking on CNN, Hoyer appeared to put impeachment—Congress’ constitutional remedy for “high crimes and misdemeanors”—off the table. “Based on what we have seen to date, going forward on impeachment is not worthwhile at this point,” he said. “Very frankly, there is an election in 18 months, and the American people will make a judgment.” Adam Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, echoed a similar point to the network: “A failed impeachment is not in the national interest.” It’s a bit awkward: We’ll hold the president accountable but not in the way you’re thinking . Democrats may be welcoming the investigative responsibility they believe that Mueller, handcuffed by internal Justice Department policy forbidding the indictment of a sitting president, left in their laps. But even should they find strong bases for presidential obstruction, Democratic leaders are still loath to say they would initiate the formal response that would seem to naturally follow. House Democrats could—hell, are even likely to—find themselves following Mueller’s roadmap to the very end, but stopping just before the finish line out of a sense of political impracticality. It’s not a comfortable position to be in. As Barr reemphasized in his Thursday morning press conference, he and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, responded to Mueller’s punt on obstruction by taking it upon themselves to determine Trump had not committed such a crime. The redacted release, however, makes clear that Mueller’s team had operated from the position that it would not make a “traditional prosecutorial decision.” Meaning even from the get-go the team decided “not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes,” even without an indictment, because “no charges can be brought.” The investigation’s stated goal, instead, was to “preserve the evidence,” and a “federal criminal accusation” could “potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct”—a constitutional process like, oh, let’s say, impeachment. Mueller also outlines several instances—asking White House counsel Don McGahn to lie, floating pardons and whispering other sweet nothings to witnesses—in which there’s a reasonable inference that the president obstructed justice, while very carefully not saying any such thing. Now what if the House Judiciary Committee takes those reasonable inferences of obstruction and certifies them as proper instances of such? What would the repercussions be then? When asked about impeachment at a Thursday afternoon press conference, Nadler said, “That’s one possibility.” He added that “there are others,” though didn’t expand much further. That may be because once you look a couple of steps above Nadler’s pay grade, you find that impeachment isn’t much of a possibility. It’s not just Hoyer. Consider one of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s clearly defined criteria for pursuing impeachment: Republican buy-in. “Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan,” she told the Washington Post in March, “I don’t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he’s just not worth it.” Republicans have unsurprisingly yet to see anything “compelling and overwhelming” enough to persuade them that they should toss their leader out of office. “Democrats want to keep searching for imaginary evidence that supports their claims, but it is simply not there,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted Thursday. “IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON.” Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, stated that “Democrats’ accusations of criminal obstruction are unfounded.” “I look forward to examining the mountain of factions supporting the principal conclusions the attorney general and deputy attorney general shared last month: no collusion, no obstruction,” Collins added. With Republicans making the shocking decision to stand by their president in the face of a not-very-friendly report, Democrats find themselves careening toward an impossible spot. The Mueller report will give them solid grounds for making the case that Trump obstructed justice, a presidential misdeed for which there is constitutional remedy. But a remedy that the hapless pursuit of which would completely distract from election-cycle contrasts that swing voters care much more about, like protections for preexisting medical conditions. House Democratic leaders want Trump to carry the stench of well-documented impeachable offenses into election season, without actually having to do the impeachment. It’s not the biggest needle to thread. Support our journalism

The Mueller report is an unflattering portrait of Donald Trump.,slate.com,Christina Cauterucci,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-donald-trump-egomaniac-bad-boss.html,"The Mueller Report Is an Irrefutable Case That Trump Is Unfit for Office President Donald Trump has committed so many brazen acts of cruelty, dishonesty, and stupidity in full view of the public that it’s not really a surprise to hear about the cruel, dishonest, and stupid things he does behind closed doors. But the lightly redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report that was released on Thursday morning is still a revelatory document. Read as a profile of the president—a piece of reporting informed by interviews with sources under oath—the Mueller report shades in the portrait of Trump that’s already imprinted on our brains. It also makes it clearer than it’s ever been that the president drives everyone around him absolutely mad. The Donald Trump that readers encounter in the report takes great pains to avoid information that will cause him any emotional discomfort, even if he’ll eventually have to confront it when it blows up into a P.R. disaster. Former White House communications director Hope Hicks told the special counsel that she tried to tell the president about emails documenting how Donald Trump Jr. organized the June 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials and a Kremlin-linked lawyer at Trump Tower. Hicks suggested they release the emails to get ahead of the story. “The President said he did not want to know about it and they should not go to the press,” the Mueller report says. “Hicks warned the President that the emails were ‘really bad’ … but the President was insistent that he did not want to talk about it and said he did not want details.” At another meeting, Hicks said, Jared Kushner tried to show Trump a folder of documents that Kushner was supposed to provide to congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. According to the report, the president “stopped Kushner and said he did not want to know about it, shutting the conversation down.” These anecdotes complement previous reports that Trump demands that he be given a folder of positive news clippings about himself twice a day. With the assistance of family members and employees who have scrambled to avoid the president’s unpredictable rage, Trump has been able to cocoon himself in reports of his own competence, outsourcing the fallout from his scam-riddled campaign and presidency to others in his orbit. He seems unable or unwilling to consider inevitable consequences, pursuing momentary comfort over necessary conflict every time. The report depicts Trump as a haughty child of privilege convinced that his social capital and powers of personality are strong enough to make any negative accusations against him (even the true ones) dissipate on their own. Chris Christie told investigators that Trump was shocked to learn that “this Russia thing” was still a thing even after Michael Flynn left the administration . “Flynn met with the Russians. That was the problem. I fired Flynn. It’s over,” Christie said Trump told him over lunch in February 2017, the day after Flynn resigned. Trump’s seeming naïveté about the severity of “this Russia thing” and his confidence that any repercussions would be absorbed by his underlings isn’t merely evidence of his willful ignorance and stunted capacity for critical thinking. It’s the logical response of a man who has, for a lifetime, evaded consequences for his bad behavior (creating a scam university , doing sketchy tax stuff ) and been rewarded with the presidency thanks to his worst tendencies (racist provocations, bragging about sexual assault). Trump’s blasé attitude about the Trump Tower meeting emails and Kushner’s documents—“leave it alone,” he allegedly told his son-in-law when he learned the documents weren’t due to Congress for a few weeks—contrasts with his well-documented paranoia over leaks to the press. According to Hicks’ account, Trump said he was sure the Trump Tower meeting emails wouldn’t leak so she shouldn’t preemptively publish them. Later, he “seemed upset” because several people in the White House knew about the emails when he wanted only a single lawyer to deal with them. “The President indicated that he did not think the emails would leak, but said they would leak if everyone had access to them,” the report says. This pas de deux of ego (“I’m sure these emails that make me look bad and possibly open me up to a damning investigation won’t leak”) and insecurity (“these emails will definitely leak if more than one person sees them”) is classic Trump. He knows that evincing open mistrust of his own administration means admitting the limits of his lackeys’ admiration and fealty to him. So he convinces himself that no one is going to betray him or compromise his public image, then smears them as incompetent turncoats when they inevitably do. The Mueller report also indicates that the president didn’t much care if the results of the Russia investigation made him seem unethical, greedy, or treasonous. He was only worried that any corroboration of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election would undermine the flattering connotations of his victory: that he won America’s popularity contest all on his own. “Several advisors” told the special counsel that Trump believed it would detract from his election triumph if people thought Russia had propped him on top of a few phone books to help him reach the dinner table. Trump also thinks the same primitive, manipulative tactics that work on him will work on everyone around him. Christie told investigators that in early 2017, the president told him to call then–FBI Director James Comey, who was launching an investigation into Russian election interference, to tell Comey that Trump “really like[s] him.” “Tell [Comey] he’s part of the team,” Trump told Christie. Trump’s conviction that Comey could be swayed with secondhand flattery delivered via the governor of New Jersey is so foolish it’s almost sad. For a man credited by his supporters with superhuman charisma and business instincts, he seems wildly inattentive to who people are, what makes them tick, and how to win them over. In these please-like-me anecdotes, Trump comes off as deeply pathetic. He appears to be a socially inept child who lives in a fantasy world that revolves around his own ego, believes no rules apply to him, barely maintains a weak grasp on logic, and is desperate to be loved. None of these observations are groundbreaking. But it’s still both troubling and satisfying to read these firsthand accounts of Trump’s failures as a president, boss, American, and human being in what was commissioned to be a dispassionate government report. It’s not just Trump’s political opponents and those beset by #resistance brain who think he’s unqualified to lead a nation, a business, a family, or a productive life. The people working hardest to protect him think so, too. Support our journalism

Mueller report shows Russia tried to troll Americans in real life.,slate.com,April Glaser,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/mueller-report-internet-research-agency-ira-trolls-real-life.html,"Why Was the Mueller Report Delivered to Congress on CDs? Within the more than 400 pages of the Mueller report released Thursday, plenty of space is dedicated to the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency, the Russian troll organization that’s been hard at work since at least 2013, churning out deceptive memes, posts, and more on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and even Pokémon Go —all with the intention of swaying political conversations and stoking social divisions around the world. The report found that no one in the Trump campaign knowingly interacted with anyone from the Internet Research Agency. But it does lay out some new information about how the operation worked. We got a close look at the troll operation when special counsel Robert Mueller indicted it and 13 Russian nationals in February 2018. The new report goes further, though, in examining how skilled the agency was at deceiving people offline, too—and also gives us a nice opportunity to reexamine and piece together some details that dripped out in the past couple of years while we waited for the final report. The Russian trolls planned dozens of rallies across the U.S. ahead of and even after the 2016 election. The first known Russian operative–organized event was a “Confederate rally” in Houston in 2015, according to new information provided in the Mueller report. An Instagram account called “Stand for Freedom” invited people to join with a post attempting (and failing) to sound like a normal American trying to get the word out about a party. “Good evening buds! Well I am planning to organize a confederate rally […] in Houston on the 14 of November and I want more people to attend,” the post read. The report describes the IRA’s attempts at field research in the U.S. In 2014, before the Internet Research Agency’s efforts to rile U.S. voters were in full swing, four employees applied to travel to the U.S., pretending to be friends who met at a party. But only two of the women who applied were granted visas, which allowed them to travel to America to conduct intelligence gathering, such as taking photographs that could then be later used in social media posts. It’s not clear how long they stayed. The reconnaissance may have helped them later plan rallies across the country, some of which attracted hundreds of attendees. The Mueller report gives the playbook for how the trolls were able to organize these events from an office in St. Petersburg, Russia: First, the IRA used one of its preexisting social media personas (Facebook groups and Twitter accounts, for example) to announce and promote the event. The IRA then sent a large number of direct messages to followers of its social media account asking them to attend the event. From those who responded with interest in attending, the IRA then sought a U.S. person to serve as the event’s coordinator. In most cases, the IRA account operator would tell the U.S. person that they personally could not attend the event because of some preexisting conflict or because they were somewhere else in the United States. The IRA then further promoted the event by contacting U.S. media about the event and directing them to speak with the coordinator. One of the larger rallies was held in Miami in August 2016. The Trump campaign took notice of this covertly Russian-organized event and posted images of the rally on the then-candidate’s official Facebook page, prompting a Russian troll–operated fake American persona, Matt Skiber, to boast in a Facebook message that “Mr. Trump posted about our event in Miami! This is great!” Black Matters, one of the larger Russian-run fake activist Facebook groups, hosted an event page for a protest in New York City the weekend after Trump won the election, which it promoted with an ad. More than 16,700 people signed up to attend on the event page, while 33,000 more listed themselves as interested. The Guardian at the time wrote that thousands of people actually showed up with protest signs in tow, though many of those protesters likely heard about the demonstration through other channels also promoting the rally. Internet Research Agency operatives didn’t mind looking weird in their quest to stoke tensions in America’s deeply polarized political climate. Beyond the rallies, Russian agents were also selling sex toys, offering free self-defense classes in New York, recruiting Americans to work with them through job listings, soliciting women to send photos for a calendar, and even offering counseling to followers of a page called Army of Jesus who were struggling with porn addiction, as detailed in research last year from New Knowledge , a firm that studies Russian disinformation. One of the more bizarre anecdotes in the Mueller report on the Internet Research Agency’s organizing explains that the Russian trolls once even attempted to recruit someone to walk around New York City dressed as Santa Claus in a Donald Trump mask. But unfortunately, the report doesn’t say whether they found anyone up to the task. Facebook, Twitter, and Google testified to Congress in 2017 about their efforts to rid their platforms of inauthentic behavior from the Kremlin-connected troll factory. Before the 2018 midterm elections, Facebook shared that it removed more than 100 more Facebook and Instagram accounts “due to concerns that they were linked to” the Internet Research Agency. The U.S. went so far as to turn off the IRA’s internet on Election Day 2018. The final Mueller report still leaves a lot of questions unanswered about the scale of the impact of the Russian trolls’ attempts to make our elections awful.

Advice about sex workers for cancer and terminal patients.,slate.com,Stoya,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/sex-workers-cancer-treatment-gift-advice.html,"I’m an Attractive Woman Who Wants No-Strings-Attached Sex. Where Do I Find Non-Creeps for That? How to Do It is Slate’s sex advice column. Send your questions for Stoya and Rich to . Every Thursday night, the crew will answer one bonus question in chat form. This week, one last dance. Dear How to Do It, My mother is in her late-50s and has been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor. She tried one round of radiation, but now she is resigned to her fate and doesn’t want more treatment. She is still mentally alert and vivacious. I disagree with her decision, but I respect it. We are open with each other, and I know that she was dating and sexually active until her diagnosis. As a final gift, I would like to give her one last fling with a young stud. I talked to an acquaintance who is good-looking, fit, and willing to perform for a reasonable fee. Do you think that I will need to tell her he is being paid? Don’t get me wrong, I would absolutely tell the truth if she asked. But this seems like a situation where “don’t ask, don’t tell” is the best policy. Also, any tips for her stud to give her the best possible experience? —Going-Away Present Stoya : So, this question. Rich : A real roller coaster of emotions—sadness and swinging and frustration and orgasming—that spans the breadth of the human experience, from birth to death. Stoya : It’s really intense. Rich : Truly. And to the letter writer, I’m so sorry about your mom’s illness and what you’re going through. Stoya : Yes, and I’m glad the writer is respecting the mom’s decisions and focusing on the present. I’m going to start at the easiest end. Tip No. 1 for the stud: Bring lube. Radiation can affect vaginal secretions, and you really don’t want a condom-burn scenario. Rich : He should treat her like she’s the hottest woman he’s ever had sex with. I mean, maybe she will be! But even if she isn’t, I hope he worships her. Stoya : Yes. If the stud is wired toward service at all, this is an opportunity. Rich : I wonder if he’s a professional sex worker or just … some dude our letter writer knows. Because how do you even bring that up with someone who isn’t in the business of giving women the business? Stoya : Perhaps it’s an acquaintance who escorts? And is out about it? Which feels like it’d be rare. Rich : Definite possibility. I’m just saying, if not, finding him must have been a story in itself. Are there any other sort of cancer-specific sex guidelines like the first one you mentioned? Because otherwise, this guy probably knows what he’s doing, assuming he’s had sex before, and he should just do it better than he’s ever done it in his life given the circumstances. Stoya : There’s some information here , and it’s probably not a bad idea for the mom to talk to her doctor if this plan goes into motion. Rich : All right, so the other attendant issues. Does the writer have to disclose that this sex has been paid for? Stoya : My gut says yes , but my brain says maybe ? Rich : Ah, interesting. I feel like, nah, it’s a white lie in the service of making a dying woman feel good about herself. But I’m curious to hear about your rationale. Stoya : Disclosure is crucial to consent. She can’t cleanly say yes to sex if she doesn’t know the conditions it is happening in. Rich : This is an excellent point. Is it that you don’t believe that whatever ego boost could arise from her thinking she bagged this stud herself isn’t worth withholding the truth on principle? Stoya : I think my main worry is the potential aftermath. What happens if she has sex under false pretenses and then finds out? Weighing the likely ego boost against the potential feelings of betrayal—I don’t think the risk is worth taking. There’s a (small!) chance the transactional nature might be a turn-on. Rich : The risk outweighs the reward. I’m curious as to how the writer planned to pull this off without notifying her what was happening? Stoya : Exactly. Especially if the guy isn’t a professional. Rich : Some kind of pizza delivery/UPS man scenario? Stoya : Or a dinner out where they have to wait at the bar and he strikes up a conversation? Rich : It seems that it would require him to also be a good actor. Maybe the writer would just say they have a friend who wants to help? In light of what you said, it doesn’t really seem like this would be that much better of a gift as a surprise than as something the writer talks to her about beforehand: “Do you want me to hire a stud for your last hurrah?” It isn’t that awkward of a conversation if you’re already in the position of knowing that your mother might enjoy something like that. Stoya : There’s a (small!) chance the transactional nature might be a turn-on. Rich : Yes, I mean, it could be something she always wanted to try. Stoya : I mean, even just knowing it’s all about you can be great. Rich : She can be as demanding as she goddamn pleases! It’s her diva day! Stoya : YES! So there are many pros to open discussion. Rich : Besides, what if this guy just doesn’t flip her switch for whatever reason? That would be awkward. Ultimately, it seems that not disclosing it is antithetical to the relationship our letter writer has with their mother, given their intimate awareness of her sex life. I can’t imagine that level of closeness with either of my parents regarding sex, but I think it’s cool for other people. I feel the same way about camping or Spam sushi: You have your fun with that, but none for me, thanks. Stoya : You’re completely right, though—if they can talk openly about sex, and consider hiring an escort as a present, they can totally talk openly about hiring the escort. Rich : Hopefully the mom is not offended at the prospect, but I have a feeling that she won’t be if she’s as progressive as she sounds. Stoya : And, like, if she’s going to get offended, it’ll be better than after the fact. "
"Mueller Report: Everything you should know about Trump, impeachment, and more.",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-summary-trump-obstruction-impeachment-barr.html,"Why Elizabeth Warren Wants the House to Start Impeachment Proceedings Against Trump The Mueller report released Thursday morning brought with it an avalanche of details about Donald Trump and Co.’s conduct on the campaign trail and in the White House. The sheer volume of the information included in the 448-page report means there will be stories developing for days, weeks, and likely months about the implications of Mueller’s findings. After one frenetic day of parsing and reporting on the 22-month investigation’s findings, we’ve got a sense of some of the biggest storylines. And if you haven’t been Ctrl+F searching for “ Ivanka ” while at work today, here’s a summary of what you need to know so far. “Insufficient Evidence” of Criminal Conspiracy It has been established Russia made an orchestrated effort to influence the U.S. election by bolstering the Trump campaign. The question for the Mueller team was not just did the Trump campaign coordinate with the Russians, but did it rise to the level criminal conspiracy? The Mueller report cites numerous contacts between Trump advisers and Russians before and after the election and found that while many Trump aides welcomed Russian election meddling to their benefit, it determined there was “insufficient evidence” to prove in a court they conspired with the Russians to tilt the election. Obstruction of Justice, a Roadmap You may have already heard that the Special Counsel also chose not to charge the president of the United States with obstruction of justice. Attorney General Bill Barr highlighted that fact in his summary of the findings, and Trump has touted it frequently on his DIY vindication tour. The Mueller report, however, states that there is no exoneration here. “If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,” Mueller’s investigators wrote. “Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment.” In fact, the report highlighted 10 potential instances of obstruction. Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern writes that while Mueller chose not to indict, what he did do is provide a roadmap for Congress that could be lethal for the Trump presidency. “Mueller only declined to indict the president because the Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal advice to the executive branch, claimed that he could not,” Stern writes. “Instead, Mueller made the case for obstruction in his meticulous report, providing a road map to Congress, which he expects to consider impeachment proceedings. There appears to be more than enough proof of criminality for the House of Representatives to draw up articles of impeachment.” Does That Mean Impeachment Is Back on the Table? We’ll see. After 12 hours of life in the age of the Mueller report, Democrats have more legal ammunition than ever to initiate impeachment proceedings, Slate’s Jim Newell writes , but they haven’t shown much interest in actually doing so. (The Political Gabfest team also discussed the specter of impeachment in the post-Mueller report era.) What Happens Now Is a Political Question, Not a Legal One Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick found the “Mueller report as a fundamentally political document as much as a legal one” and the outcome of all this will be political too. “It’s a delineation, chapter and verse, of how Trump has conducted himself in office, and for anyone who believes that the president should not be above the law, this is a damning report of presidential lawlessness ,” Lithwick writes. “[T]he American public can no longer claim that nothing has happened. Mueller has shown us what is true. Nobody in the White House has disputed it. We can decide we’re fine with it or that we are not fine with it. That’s a political question, not a legal one. I think that may be what needed to happen all along.” Is Attorney General Bill Barr Acting in Good Faith? The Attorney General held a press conference Thursday morning before the report was even released in an apparent effort to get first crack at defining what was about to come. In light of what is in the Mueller report, Barr’s initial letter to Congress looks even more willfully evasive. “Barr’s spin on special counsel Robert S. Mueller’s report all but ignored the report’s damning findings, misrepresented significant parts of Mueller’s reasoning, and described President Donald Trump’s motivations and supposed cooperation in terms straight out of White House talking points,” Peter Shane writes . “Barr engaged in word-splitting pettifoggery that would make even Bill Clinton blush. Barr is clearly compromised by the partisan goals of this White House to the point where he cannot be trusted in the job. He should resign immediately.” What About the Pee Tape?! Yes, the infamous pee tape gets a mention in a footnote, but it doesn’t offer much new about the real star here—the mythical, and possibly totally hypothetical, Trump sex tape. The report does say that a Russian businessman who tipped off Trump weeks before the election about the tape’s existence said he was told it was fake. Stay tuned! Home Run Line of the Report: “This Is the End of my Presidency. I’m Fucked.” This was Trump’s response after first learning a special counsel had been appointed to head the Russia investigation. One for the ages. Conclusion : Get some rest. This is far from over."

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 19, 2019 When there is not an underlying crime with regard to Collusion (in fact, the whole thing was a made up fraud), it is difficult to say that someone is obstructing something.

"How Mueller’s report could affect 2020 Democrats, in the primary and general election.",slate.com,Josh Voorhees,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-2020-democrats-response-bernie-kamala-warren.html,"Why Elizabeth Warren Wants the House to Start Impeachment Proceedings Against Trump Robert Mueller’s report is far more damning than President Donald Trump and his allies would have the American public believe. The special counsel documented, in detail, multiple attempts by Trump to derail the federal investigation into his campaign and presidency. The report suggests Mueller declined to indict the president for obstruction of justice not because he lacked the evidence, but the authority to do so. Still, the former FBI director managed to draw Congress the road map it needs to impeach Trump, making the most pressing question whether House Democrats will follow it. That raises related questions for the deep field of Democrats running for president: What should they do with the new information? Is the report damning enough to make it the centerpiece of a campaign? Or are they better off focusing on things like health care, an issue their party rode to victory in the midterms? The candidates’ early responses suggest the major players will take a measured approach, much like they did after Attorney General William Barr released his misleading summary late last month. Then, they demanded the release of the full report. Now, the likes of Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders are demanding that lawmakers see the unredacted version and hear directly from Mueller so Democrats can continue their congressional investigations. Such restraint from the 2020 field is both natural and smart. As I’ve noted before , you can’t build a presidential campaign on the promise of impeaching the president—both because impeachment is the responsibility of the House, and because the need to impeach would become moot the very moment the next president is sworn in. Furthermore, each and every Democratic hopeful is running—at least implicitly—on the idea that Trump should be removed from office, albeit at the end of his first term rather than in the middle of it. Unlike their friends in the House, the White House hopefuls can sidestep the yes-no question of impeachment simply by saying that the Mueller report makes the need to defeat Trump at the ballot box that much clearer. If House Democrats sit on their hands, it’s possible that a presidential candidate or two may come out publicly in favor of impeachment as a way to grab some attention. Such a move could be an act of catharsis for some progressives, given how the Steny Hoyers of their party are acting at the moment. (“Very frankly, there is an election in 18 months, and the American people will make a judgment,” said Hoyer , a man elected to a two-year term.) But any buzz would likely be fleeting, since the Democratic rank-and-file have yet to show all that much interest in hearing from the presidential candidates about the investigation, even as the talking heads have kept it front and center for the past year. It’s not that Democratic voters don’t care about Trump’s wrongdoing. It’s just that they care more about other issues. According to Gallup , for instance, 66 percent of Democrats said the Russia investigation was either extremely or very important to their midterm votes, good for just ninth on a list of 12 issues—21 percentage points behind health care, and 9 and 8 percentage points behind climate change and immigration, respectively. Meanwhile, saying Trump’s unfit for office isn’t exactly a game changer in a Democratic primary where even the guy who talks glowingly about his Republican friends and the bipartisan days of yore wants voters to imagine him “ beat[ing] the hell out of ” Trump. There’s plenty of disagreement within the Democratic Party—on everything from how best to expand health care coverage to how not to invade a woman’s personal space —but there’s not much when it comes to the man currently in the Oval Office: They want him out . Broadly speaking, Mueller’s findings are good news for the eventual Democratic nominee if for no other reason than they are bad news for Donald Trump. But it’s unclear how much the report itself will move the needle in a general election, which is still more than a year away. The report was only released 10 hours ago, and a lot can still change. But Barr’s summary, as misleading as it was, failed to significantly shift public opinion about the investigation, nor did it have a major impact on Trump’s lackluster approval rating , which has been remarkably steady during his time in office—even as much of what is documented in Mueller’s report came to light in drips and drabs before today. Again, that doesn’t mean voters don’t care about the report—simply that most of those feelings are already baked into the campaign cake. The good news for Democrats, then, is that Mueller has effectively made the obstruction case for them, freeing their eventual nominee to focus his or her attention elsewhere. Support our journalism

William Barr must resign.,slate.com,,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/william-barr-resign-mueller-report.html,"There Might Be More Mueller-Related Prosecutions After All In no small part because of the performance on Thursday of Attorney General William Barr, history will treat his Justice Department as it treats the Justice Department under Richard Nixon’s one-time attorney general, John Mitchell—an institution compromised by rank partisanship and more committed to ideology than the rule of law. Barr’s spin on special counsel Robert S. Mueller’s report all but ignored the report’s damning findings, misrepresented significant parts of Mueller’s reasoning, and described President Donald Trump’s motivations and supposed cooperation in terms straight out of White House talking points. Barr engaged in word-splitting pettifoggery that would make even Bill Clinton blush. Barr is clearly compromised by the partisan goals of this White House to the point where he cannot be trusted in the job. He should resign immediately. Barr started Thursday’s pre-report rebuttal by reiterating that “the special counsel found no ‘collusion’ by any Americans in the [Russian Internet Research Agency’s] illegal activity.” Using the word collusion was itself slippery given that collusion could take the form of an explicit illegal agreement or, in common parlance, just a “connivance,” or tacit encouragement, or assent to wrongdoing by another. It was precisely because of the ambiguity of collusion that the report avoids the term:
In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of “collusion.” […] [C]ollusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office’s focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law. In other words, Mueller did not find “no collusion”; what he found was insufficient “evidence likely to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Campaign officials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, and Carter Page acted as agents of the Russian government—or at its direction, control, or request—during the relevant time period.” Mueller doubted he could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that participants in the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting violated the federal election-law ban on contributions and donations by foreign nationals. Such proof would require both a demonstration of their willfulness and that the information received by the Trump campaign was “a thing of value” worth at least $2,000 for a criminal violation or $25,000 for felony indictment. This kind of leadership and the debasement of government lawyering it augurs will take years to repair. An inability to prove the elements of criminal conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt hardly belies the Trump campaign’s tacit encouragement of or assent to Russian wrongdoing. Collusion of that sort is amply shown by the Mueller investigation’s documentation of over 100 contacts between the campaign and Russians hoping to tilt the election to Trump. Indeed, for encouragement, one need look no further than candidate Trump’s July 27, 2016, statement: “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.” Barr’s discussion of obstruction of justice is even worse for Trump. In his four-page account of the Mueller report, Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had determined from the Mueller report that no criminal obstruction of justice had occurred. He said they were not basing their conclusion on a view that sitting presidents could not be indicted: “Our determination was made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president.” At today’s press conference , Barr tried to make it sound as if Mueller’s decision not to charge the president was also made without regard to that theory:
When we met with [Mueller] … we specifically asked him about the OLC opinion and whether or not he was taking a position that he would have found a crime but for the existence of the OLC opinion. And he made it very clear several times that that was not his position. He was not saying that but for the OLC opinion, he would have found a crime. Here is what the report actually states:
We considered whether to evaluate the conduct we investigated under the Justice Manual standards governing prosecution and declination decisions, but we determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes. … Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges can be brought. The ordinary means for an individual to respond to an accusation is through a speedy and public trial, with all the procedural protections that surround a criminal case. An individual who believes he was wrongly accused can use that process to seek to clear his name. In contrast, a prosecutor’s judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, affords no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator.
The concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened in the case of a sitting President, where a federal prosecutor’s accusation of a crime, even in an internal report, could carry consequences that extend beyond the realm of criminal justice. OLC noted similar concerns about sealed indictments. In short, for Barr’s statement to be regarded as truthful, you have to interpret the notion of “but for” cause very, very narrowly. Parsed narrowly, Mueller does not say that he would have charged a crime “but for” the OLC opinion. He also relied on “fairness considerations” noted in the OLC opinion. Saying, however, that Mueller’s failure to charge obstruction was not based on the Justice Department’s policy regarding incumbent presidents puts us in the same territory as wondering what “the definition of ‘is’ is.” Barr’s tendentiousness is all the more notable if one reads just one paragraph further in the Mueller report: “[I]f we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment.” Beyond this, Barr applauded Trump for taking “no act that in fact deprived the special counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation.” This ignores Trump’s refusal himself to be interviewed, a critical omission in an investigation of a crime that turns significantly on a suspect’s state of mind. Barr further implicitly excused Trump’s outbursts directed at ending the Russia investigation as a reflection of Trump’s agitated state of mind: “There is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks.” When a reporter suggested his remarks were “quite generous to the president, including acknowledging his feelings and emotions,” Barr insisted “the statements about his sincere beliefs are recognized in the report.” However, the report offers no explicit conclusions about the president’s sincerity at all, which, in any event, would appear to be legally irrelevant as to his motivations. In an earlier work discussing the importance of government lawyers to maintaining the rule of law, I wrote of the essential “self-discipline for those immediately involved in [executive branch decisions] to actually concern themselves with perspectives and interests other than the partisan agenda they all share.” The attorney general today showed none of that discipline. Worse, his leadership surely sends a message to other Justice Department lawyers as to their expected priorities. This kind of leadership and the debasement of government lawyering it augurs will take years to repair, as it did in the wake of Mitchell himself. There is no way to begin that job until Barr is out of office. Support our journalism

"Gentleman Jack, reviewed.",slate.com,Inkoo Kang,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/gentleman-jack-review-sally-wainwright-anne-lister.html,"The Twist in Jordan Peele’s Twilight Zone Is There’s Not Much Jordan Peele What we know about Anne Lister is remarkable enough. Born in 1791 in Northern England, she was the first known climber of the highest mountain in the French Pyrenees, a student of brain surgery under Georges Cuvier in Paris, the engineer of her own coal mines, and a diarist whose millions of words encompassed two dozen volumes, much of it in a code that wouldn’t be broken until nearly a century after her death. But Lister is best known today for marrying another woman in 1834, earning her the title, in some circles, of the “first modern lesbian.” In the new HBO drama Gentleman Jack , named after one of Lister’s sobriquets, creator and sole writer Sally Wainwright ( Happy Valley , Last Tango in Halifax ) imagines what we can’t know. Wainwright gives us a profoundly human heroine who’s never just an idealistic queer woman, or an elitist landowner, or a tough but finesse-lacking entrepreneur, or a would-be intellectual whose giddiness during an autopsy proves infectious, but a multifaceted character who never wants to sacrifice any part of herself or her prerogatives. Between Wainwright’s crisp, fair-minded scripts and star Suranne Jones’ flawless performance, it’s tempting to believe that Anne Lister was the most fascinating person of the 19 th century, both a product of her time and an anti-conformist whose forward thinking would not be appreciated in its entirety during her lifetime. At the start of Gentleman Jack , the well-traveled, Paris-obsessed Anne dreads returning even for the shortest of spells to “my shabby little [estate] and my shabby little family.” But as she faces her 40s, nursing heartbreak once again, Anne decides that her next romantic target—a wealthy younger woman with no inclination toward (heterosexual) marriage named Ann Walker (Sophie Rundle)—might be worth the trouble of settling down in her provincial hometown. Anne desperately wants never-ending fireworks in a lifelong partnership, but her courtship of the painfully sheltered Miss Walker is like any man’s would have been, both economically motivated and alarmingly contingent on convincing a relative stranger to make a momentous, unalterable decision in a panic attack–inducing-ly brief period of time. Jones is intoxicatingly seductive in her virile hyperconfidence and androgynous, all-black clothes (men’s shirts, jackets, and coats, always paired with a long skirt). In the first few episodes (there are eight all told), Anne has to bewitch Miss Walker while broaching the possibility of Sapphic love itself—a lesson she teaches with an appreciative gaze and a wolfish smile. Sexy and funny in equal measure, these drawing-room scenes, in which Anne inches closer to Miss Walker as the gorgeously lurid tendrils in the wallpaper seem to come alive, swell the tensions inherent to the situation. Is Anne exploiting Miss Walker’s lack of sexual experience or introducing the young woman to herself for the first time? Does Anne really see a future with Miss Walker, or is she simply trying to fill the hole left by her previous lover? Can we truly root for Anne’s triumph when Miss Walker has little idea of the rumors swirling around them and appears unready to contend with the locals’ vicious hostility to their “unnatural” pleasures? And by opening up Miss Walker’s realm of possibilities, is Anne liberating her or inadvertently leading her into a trap? Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

Gentleman Jack is full of such ambivalences, never letting us forget what an original Anne is, while suggesting that a lifetime of asserting herself in order to get what she wants—and usually having the weight of moral authority behind her—may have left her ill-prepared for cooperation or compromise. A scheme to sell the coal buried on her land runs her afoul of powerful, connected brothers (Shaun Dooley and Vincent Franklin) who are just as determined as she is but unfettered by her social disadvantages and Darcy-esque inflexibility. And because every scene with Anne feels so ripe and distinct, the ones that expand the village of Halifax, including a murder cover-up and a hit-and-run mystery, add suspense but inevitably feel rote in comparison, making the hourlong episodes feel slightly longer than they should. It’s impossible not to be reminded of The Favourite , with its near-absurdist mix of period-drama tropes and modern disruptions. Wainwright doesn’t feature anything as overt as Yorgos Lanthimos’ psychedelic rabbits, but the chic sets can be almost garishly colorful, and Anne’s born-this-way queer theorizing feels a little too pat. The gestures toward the latter day are fun, but I found myself relieved when the show would force Anne back to her Regency settings, where we could observe how she clings to the caste system that enables her personal freedoms or how the habitual confinement of wealthy women could lend itself to lesbian affairs. Anne can’t help testing how open she can be—with her family, her servants, her would-be in-laws, the world at large. It’s a lot more than you might think, but nowhere near enough. "

Sarah Huckabee Sanders defends lies about Comey’s firing on GMA.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/sarah-sanders-mueller-report-lies-comey.html,"The Mueller Report Is an Irrefutable Case That Trump Is Unfit for Office In a contentious interview Friday on Good Morning America, Sarah Huckabee Sanders vehemently denied admitting to Robert Mueller’s team that she had lied on behalf of President Trump. Sanders insisted Friday that the lies depicted in the Mueller report were simply harmless mistakes she made “in the heat of the moment,” not, as she seemed to have admitted to investigators, intentional falsehoods meant to twist the narrative. The first lie Sanders addressed on GMA had to do with the president’s reasons for firing FBI Director James Comey. As the report made clear , the president from the beginning was motivated by his frustration over the Russia investigation and Comey’s unwillingness to publicly state that Trump was not under investigation. After some urging from then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and support from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Trump drafted a letter that made it explicitly clear the firing had to do with the investigation. But in her comments to the press in May 2017 after Comey’s firing, Sanders explained that Trump, the DOJ, and various members of Congress in both parties lost confidence in Comey, “[a]nd most importantly, the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director.” After a reporter indicated that the majority of the FBI supported Comey, Sanders replied, “Look, we’ve heard from countless members of the FBI saying very different things.” It was a statement she repeated twice more in media appearances. But according to the report: “Sanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from ‘countless members of the FBI’ was a ‘slip of the tongue.’ She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made ‘in the heat of the moment’ that was not founded on anything.” When George Stephanopolous pressed her Friday on how she could call the line a “slip of the tongue” when she repeated it twice the next day, Sanders denied his assertion that it was a “deliberate, false statement”:
Actually, if you look at what I said, I said the slip of the tongue was in using the word ‘countless,’ but there were a number of FBI both former and current that agreed with the president’s decision. And they continued to speak out and say that and send notice of the White House of that agreement with the president’s decision. James Comey was a disgraced leaker. But, as Stephanopoulos pointed out, Mueller had concluded that that assertion was baseless. “That’s what you talked to the special counsel about when you were facing criminal penalties if you didn’t tell the truth, but now you’re trying to walk away from it. Why can’t you acknowledge that what you said then was not true?” She responded:
I said the word I used, ‘countless,’ and I also said if you look at what’s in quotations from me, it’s that and it’s that it’s in the heat of the moment, meaning it wasn’t a scripted talking point. I’m sorry I wasn’t a robot like the Democrat party. Her second falsehood had to do with a statement Trump dictated on behalf of his son Donald Trump, Jr., to respond to a New York Times report about the 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Trump campaign officials, including Don Jr., and a Russian lawyer offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. Sanders told reporters at the time that Trump didn’t dictate the letter but instead “weighed in, offered suggestions like any father would do.” In interviews with the special counsel, the president’s lawyers said Trump did dictate the letter. “So why did you tell the press that the president did not dictate that statement, when he did?” Stephanopoulos asked. “I’m not denying that he had involvement in what the statement said,” she responded. “That was the information I was given at the time and I stated it to the public.” “Sarah, that’s just not what happened,” Stephanopoulos said. “You said the president didn’t dictate the statement. The president’s lawyer said that he did dictate the statement. That’s what they wrote.” “My understanding at the time was that he hadn’t dictated but that he weighed in, George,” Sanders responded. Meanwhile, as the Washington Post noted, on Fox News on Thursday night, just after CNN pressed Sanders on the apparent culture of lying in the White House, Sean Hannity gave Sanders “more than three uncontested minutes to roast ‘Democrats and members of the liberal media’ and to insist that Trump had been ‘totally vindicated.’” Support our journalism

"Mueller Report: House judiciary committee subpoenas full, unredacted report.",slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-house-judiciary-committee-jerrold-nadler.html,"Why Elizabeth Warren Wants the House to Start Impeachment Proceedings Against Trump The House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena for the full and unredacted version of the Mueller report, including grand jury material and other documents not made public, Chairman Jerrold Nadler announced Friday morning. In a statement, Nadler indicated that he considered the current redactions to be significant and a hurdle to understanding the full scope of the investigation’s findings. “Even the redacted version of the report outlines serious instances of wrongdoing by President Trump and some of his closest associates,” he said. “It now falls to Congress to determine the full scope of that alleged misconduct and to decide what steps we must take going forward.” The subpoena requests that Attorney General William Barr turn over the documents by May 1 at 10 a.m. Barr has said laws, regulations, and department practices prevented him from making some of the underlying evidence from the report public. A court will likely decide if there is validity to Nadler’s argument that the report falls under an exception to grand jury secrecy rules. Barr had previously offered to allow some congressional leaders from both parties to go through a more lightly redacted version in a secure reading room. In his statement, Nadler, who was granted authority by the committee earlier this month to subpoena the report and underlying documents, said he was “open to working with the Department to reach a reasonable accommodation for access to these materials” but “cannot accept any proposal which leaves most of Congress in the dark, as they grapple with their duties of legislation, oversight and constitutional accountability.” It’s likely Republicans in Congress will protest Nadler’s request. Rep. Douglas Collins, the top Republican on the committee, called the subpoena “ wildly overbroad ” and unrealistically burdensome for a May 1 deadline. He also accused Nadler of giving a May 1 deadline because Barr had offered to testify the next day, allowing the chairman “to grandstand and rail against the attorney general for not cooperating on an impossible timeline.” Nadler also sent a letter to Mueller on Thursday requesting he testify before Congress about the report “as soon as possible.” The report released Thursday contained nearly 1,000 redactions, according to NBC News , and seven of its pages were blacked out entirely."

Instagram wellness advises listening to your body above all else.,slate.com,Lily Puckett,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/listen-body-instagram-wellness-rabbit-holes.html,"Rabbit Holes: Why I Collect Complicated Recipes I Know I’ll Never Make Recently, I noticed a cramp in what I thought might be my kidney, which I understood to be near the ribs. For a few days, I wondered if this cramp was getting serious, so serious that it could be an infection. There were no other signs of infection, and in fact my kidneys seem really healthy, based on what I remember from Googling kidneys a few years ago when I wondered at that time if I had an infection as well. But even without signs, the cramp remained. I couldn’t stretch it away, despite knowing every stretch. And a few nights after the cramp appeared, I was so cold. Even though it makes sense that I was cold because I had taken off the leggings I was sleeping in case they were bothering the kidney infection, I wondered if that chill might be related to everything else. If I really thought about it, especially if I thought about it while remaining absolutely still, I wondered if I might be dying. When I mentioned this to my mother, she said “you are not dying, ” and then asked me how my writing was going. I ignored that because I wanted to focus on my kidney. Later, when I re-Googled kidney infections, I found out they’re not really where the cramp was, and also that cramp disappeared. But then a new pain appeared, and thismade me think there must be something else wrong, something less named and more mysterious overall. Realizing Google and my mother were never going to solve my problems, I turned to social media instead. Immediately I found the root of my pain on Instagram, where everyone is much more focused on how and why our bodies are terrible. You are not dying , users across the app told me, but you are in trouble . The solution was simple: Stop listening to anything else and listen to only your body instead. Captions from people who were broken like me—in an invisible way that you can’t describe fully and that might not even be necessarily bad—explained how we’d gotten here. Sometimes what I need is to take a break and just focus on me, just let myself talk, just hear what my body is telling me , I read, and I thought, I need to do that too. I realized it was insane to try and get anything done at all without first taking the time to assess how my body felt, not just about doing work, but also about the desire to do work, which might be the problem to begin with. In the past, the answer to whether or not I was too sick to write 800 words was clear and brief: No, probably not. But now, on Instagram, the truth was revealed: Maybe, yes. I mix one part lemon and one part ginger and one part turmeric into warm water and apple cider vinegar , I read one night when looking for a solution to how to feel better when you don’t feel perfect. I drink this in the morning when I’m feeling like something’s off . I wanted to ask her what she means when she says something’s off ,but someone in her messages already had. I’m not a doctor or anything so don’t take this like that, but sometimes we just need to slow down. She’s saying this while she sits in front of a plant, wearing a sports bra, and I want to hold the image and zoom in because I want to know what’s wrong with her, since it can’t be as bad as whatever’s wrong with me. I pay attention to what my body is telling me, and I try to give it what it’s asking for . Under her influence, I want to give mine the same thing. Outside of my body, there’s so much noise. There are deadlines I’m ignoring, and there are jobs that I don’t want to hear back from, and there are people that I need to see in person instead of just texting, and there are so many errands; every day there are errands. If I tune all of that out and I hear only my body, what I hear first is peace. There is silence, finally, and it isn’t useless. This is necessary, I’ve been told by the experts, who legally must constantly remind me that they aren’t experts. But still they’re sure that I should turn everything off and go inward as often as possible. If I tune all of that out and I hear only my body, what I hear first is peace. There is silence, finally, and it isn’t useless. I start every day by meditating , one caption told me, and I never get sick . I want that, sort of—it seems very dangerous, and maybe immoral—but more than anything I want that silence. I want to hear what my body is telling me because I want it to only be us in here. If I listen well enough and I hear something troubling, I know from countless Instagram Stories that I’m allowed to tell everyone else to leave us alone. We are struggling , I can write, we need a break . If I only listen to my body, I can’t hear my mother say, “A break from what, exactly?” And I can’t hear my editor say, “That’s fine, just let me know when you think you’ll feel better.” All I hear is us. We are so quiet, and we are so unwell, and what we need more than anything is more silence. Once we’re well, what I think we’ll sound like is a scream. We’ll sound the way something trapped and forgotten sounds when it first sees the sun, and I don’t think anyone will want to listen to us anymore even if we’re giving them advice on how to better drink water. But this could take years of unauthorized meditation and healing, and I’m only barely interested in the final product. Actually, when we’re at our weakest, my body and me, I think we’re happiest. We can hear better this way. We can listen to the experts (legally not experts) instead."

Under the Silver Lake review: David Robert Mitchell’s follow-up to It Follows.,slate.com,Inkoo Kang,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/under-the-silver-lake-review-andrew-garfield-it-follows.html,"Tim Burton’s Dumbo Tries to Have Its Disney-Satirizing Cake and Profit Off It Too Under the Silver Lake , the new film by writer-director David Robert Mitchell ( It Follows ), wants to be a treasure map. Packed with codes, coincidences, and callbacks, it practically begs for dissection, and the more exhaustive the better. As is fitting, or perhaps just predictable, for a neo-noir set in a hipster-ridden, Hollywood-adjacent pocket of L.A., the clues involve old-timey movie stars, ancient issues of Playboy, milquetoast satanism, hand-drawn zines, and lots of naked women. So here’s the hitch: Under the Silver Lake is so wonderfully barbed as a satire of the kinds of dudes who’d spend their time deciphering puzzle movies like this one—“An entire generation of men obsessed with video games, secret codes, space aliens,” tuts a character—that the film can’t help deflating when it demands the very thing it skewers. Normally, a bungled sendup like this would annoy me terribly. (I’ll also add here that Under the Silver Lake halfheartedly attempts an exposé of the casual misogyny of its protagonist and showbiz at large but ends up giving in to its horndog impulses.) It doesn’t help that the plot is tortuous, and the resolution is an inarguable letdown. And yet! Mitchell’s ambitions, observations, and moods make the picture a dippy blast, like a hallucinatory trip that definitely goes on too long but is well worth the insights and surprises. Mitchell’s ambitions, observations, and moods make the picture a dippy blast, like a hallucinatory trip that definitely goes on too long but is well worth the insights and surprises. Andrew Garfield stars as our dick, an unemployed voyeur five days from eviction. After a flirty neighbor (Riley Keough) goes missing—even her furniture disappears overnight—Sam commits to finding her whereabouts, with nary a thought to his imminent homelessness. His sleuthing takes him to the backs of cereal boxes, the insides of Nintendo Power magazine, and his own numerological calculations on pizza-box lids, but also fancy, kitschy pool parties in downtown hotels that he can just get into, because a young, white, good-looking guy isn’t gonna be turned down for his ripped clothes or skunky stench. (I think Mitchell is saying that.) Sam’s guide through the first leg of his quest is a local zine artist (Patrick Fischler) who’s somehow even more pathetic, confirming Sam’s suspicions about subliminal messages in advertisements while jabbering on about dangers like succubuses in owl masks that even have our gullible cynic scratching his head. Accompanied by an ironic, 1940s-style classic-noir score, Under the Silver Lake ’s first hour contains its strongest scenes, as Mitchell reveals ever-newer depths to Sam’s lunacy and self-debasement. (At one point, a homeless man notes how bad Sam stinks.) Intriguingly, he’s always got a buddy to talk to—a loose confederation of failsons who enable each other’s worst tendencies, like a subreddit in real time. Those guys are preoccupied with the invisible alpha males running the world—a secret brotherhood supposedly sending hidden messages to each other through the media. It’s such a timely parody of a particular brand of paranoid, narcissistic masculinity that the film immediately diminishes when it turns out there is a conspiracy afoot, and that pop culture actually is being used to brainwash the masses. Under the Silver Lake takes Sam all over his neighborhood and nowhere at once. He zips from parties to mountaintops, mansions to landmarks, but the faster he runs, the more we can smell the plot’s fumes. Still, the atmosphere remains enjoyable: Wafting through are a well-trained henchwoman (Zosia Mamet) who most certainly knows what happened to Sam’s missing neighbor, a faux-transgressive band called Jesus and the Brides of Dracula, and, most memorably, a rapacious songwriter (a scene-stealing Jeremy Bobb) who punctures the possibility of Sam ever escaping the prison of mass control with an aggressive piano medley of beloved pop tunes. The Lynchian impressionism that Mitchell strives for in the film’s latter half is a lot less successful than his straight-ahead caricature, particularly when the action veers into violence. But indelible, too, is Sam’s realization that the power and exclusivity he envies so much is nearly always dedicated to buying higher levels of that same self-segregation.

I haven’t yet mentioned the mysterious death of a billionaire that overtakes the city as its primary cultural phenomenon, or the dog named Coca-Cola, or what coyotes, James Dean, and Wheel of Fortune have to do with all this. Garfield is altogether convincing as a dirtbag skating by as a decent dude, but the movie’s real “star” is the cascade of events that happen to his character, including in the transportive dream sequences. I wish Under the Silver Lake made more sense, or had a point, but I’m also fine with this carousel of crazy lacking both of those things. Bless this mess. "
Why there won’t be any expeditions to the North Pole this year.,slate.com,Jane C. Hu,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/north-pole-barneo-last-degree-expeditions-canceled.html,"Why Was the Mueller Report Delivered to Congress on CDs? Getting to the North Pole is not straightforward. While early explorers made the trek from northern Canada and Siberia over hundreds of miles of treacherous ice, many modern adventurers choose to complete a “last degree” expedition, traveling from 89 degrees north to the true geographic pole during a brief window in the spring.* However, for the first time since 2002, no one’s making the trek this year, thanks to a combination of geopolitical tension and too-warm weather. To understand why, first bear with me through some expedition logistics. Most aspiring North Pole expeditions—including both tourists and researchers—begin their journey in Longyearbyen, a small town on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard known for its global seed vault and for rumors that it outlaws dying . (In truth, there’s no rule against death there; it’s just recommended you do it elsewhere.) At 78 degrees north, it’s the world’s northernmost settlement, and it offers adventurers a base camp to stock up on gear, take a good hot shower, and go out for burgers and beers before making a bid for the pole. The next step on the way to the pole is Barneo, a pop-up camp built every year as a depot for expedition hopefuls. (The name is meant to be a play on its contrast to the tropical island of Borneo.) Every year since 2002, a group of Russians have taken helicopters to search among the fragmented ice for a hearty ice floe close to 89 degrees north and then parachuted down to set up camp. Late March and April is traditionally the season for these expeditions; there’s enough sunlight for adventurers to trek, the temperatures are somewhat bearable, and the ice is still somewhat intact (though increasingly less so). This is the first time since Barneo was established that no explorers would have a shot at the pole. At Barneo, administrators assemble tents and, most crucially, fashion a makeshift runway to accommodate the airplanes that shuttle visitors to and from Longyearbyen. Nearly all North Pole travel works through Barneo. After all, it’s much easier to coordinate with its administrators than to, say, try to find a suitable ice floe yourself and travel from there. The ice floe typically sustains the camp for about a month, during which time hundreds of expeditioners arrive at Barneo to do research, take a helicopter to the pole (if you’re rich), run the North Pole Marathon , or ski roughly 70 miles to the geographic pole.* There are, of course, also the gimmicks: This year, a gin company had planned to open a “ one-day pop-up bar ” at the pole giving away a lifetime supply of their booze. There is also a hockey matchup called “ the Last Game ,” meant to bring awareness to the fragility of the Arctic. But all pole events came to a standstill after Barneo officials called off the season. While the base has experienced significant delays before—all 2018 expeditions were delayed by 10 days, and there were fears the season would be canceled altogether—this is the first time since Barneo was established that no explorers would have a shot at the pole. The perfect confluence of politics and conditions stymied the base’s operations. Typically, the camp enlists an AN-74 transport plane from Ukraine, but it appears that conflicts between Russia and Ukraine interrupted its travel between Longyearbyen and Barneo. In a Facebook post last week, polar guide Eric Philips said delays stemmed from “the revoking of a permit allowing the Ukrainian-owned Antonov-74 from flying above 80 degrees north and onto what the Russians are claiming as their territory (despite being international ‘waters’).” That may sound like a wild move on Russia’s part, but given the country’s history in Svalbard and its desire to claim the North Pole for itself, it wouldn’t be out of character. Barneo is no stranger to this political drama. After some bad blood between Russia and Norway interrupted the 2016 season, Barneo officials considered moving the camp to Russian island Franz Josef Land going forward. But another long-time polar guide, Eric Larsen, says it was actually the Ukrainians who tapped the brakes to avoid conflict with Russia, an account that Svalbard newspaper the Barents Observer backed up . Either way, the dispute caused significant delays, and by the time alternate aircraft could be called in, the weather had become unstable. With climate change’s toll on the Arctic, the expedition season has grown shorter and more dangerous. Last year was Barneo’s shortest season to date—it was only open for business for 12 days . (For reference, ski expeditions typically take between seven and 10 days, so the window for a successful bid is small.) This year, conditions were no better. After the Arctic sea ice reached its maximum winter extent in mid-March, it began melting rapidly, and, for the third year in a row , it is at the lowest amount ever recorded at this time of year. As ice conditions deteriorate in coming years, so will adventurers’ chances of reaching the pole, and this will exacerbate the already-tense relationship between the governments of Arctic countries. There’s been speculation for years about the end of the era in which humans can reach the pole. Even back in 2007, expeditioners were already remarking that the Arctic ice was markedly thinner and more treacherous than it was in the 1980s. That’s made it nearly impossible for more hardcore expeditioners to do the “proper” pole trip, in which they ski from northern Canada, Russia, Greenland, or Alaska to the pole, carrying their own gear with no outside support. While there were seven such expeditions between 2005 and 2010, there has been only one since then, which was completed in 2014 by Larsen and his partner, Ryan Waters. After that trip, Larsen predicted they would be the last people to do so. “North Pole expeditions are going the way of the passenger pigeon,” he told National Geographic a year later. In 2017, a pair of explorers tried to prove them wrong, but had to abandon their mission after one got severe frostbite . Now, it seems even last-degree trips might be nearing their end as well. But Philips is hopeful. “With a year of planning I have no doubt that Barneo will be up and running as it has been every year,” he told me from an expedition in Svalbard. “Weather and ice conditions will still play their part in determining how a season unfolds, but these natural phenomen[a] … have affected Arctic travelers since the beginning.” Future Tense is a partnership of Slate , New America , and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.

Ancestry.com ad “Inseparable” sells a flattering view of racial history.,slate.com,Rebecca Onion,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/ancestry-ad-inseparable-racist-slave-history.html,"This Reporter Was One of the Last People on the Roof of Notre Dame. She Explains Why the Cathedral Will Long Outlive the Fire. Following a tweet by Business Insider producer Emmanuel Ocbazghi, who first flagged the ad, many black Twitter users, particularly those who study the black experience in America, reacted in disbelief. “I have so many questions about this @Ancestry commercial,” law professor Melissa Murray wrote . “1) Is she his slave? 2) is this a real story? 3) is she his slave?” Journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones tweeted , “While it’s true that 1 in 4 black folks who test their male line through DNA end up finding a white man, it ain’t because of no damn slavery love story. I’m so tired of y’all.” When I asked the company about the ad’s origins, a spokesperson responded with a statement: “Ancestry is committed to telling important stories from history.” “This ad,” the statement continued, “was intended to represent one of these stories. We very much appreciate the feedback we have received and apologize for any offense that the ad may have caused. We are in the process of pulling the ad from television and have it removed from YouTube.” (The ad was originally made for the Canadian market; it is unclear if it aired on television elsewhere.) I asked, in a return email, whether “Abigail Williams” (the name the spot attributes to the woman of the pair) actually existed. The last image in the ad, which fades to black while spotlighting an old-timey-looking marriage certificate with Williams’ name and a sepia photo of the two young lovers, implies that she did. The language in the company’s statement (“important,” “represent”) leaves it unclear. As of Friday afternoon, the company had not responded to my follow-up. But it doesn’t much matter whether Abigail Williams was a real person who actually fled to Canada with a white man. If this never happened, then we have to wonder why Ancestry.com settled on this fictional story—a sop to white egos, cast with attractive actors and set in a very stylized “historical” milieu, the whole thing oddly reminiscent of Titanic —to sell the concept of genealogical discovery. If it did happen, then Ancestry.com cherry-picked one historical story, a complete outlier within a much larger history containing many, many terrible and traumatic situations—rape, family separation, the selling and buying of black women for purposes of breeding—to advertise their service. In either case, as black Twitter users pointed out, there’s a deep blindness here about what historical family research might mean for black people. “One of about 1,000 awful things about this commercial is it ignores the fact that for black Americans—myself included—and for others in the diaspora, DNA and documentary ancestry information is as painful and traumatic as it is illuminating,” journalist Kimberly Atkins tweeted . “These are not love stories.” Historian Blair L.M. Kelley posted a thread that imagined the many other stories about family relationships that a black person pursuing genealogical research might find instead of this stylized fable that looks like it could be on the CW network: “Maybe they can make a commercial where a white male owner sells away his own mixed race children. That would be warm and fuzzy. … Maybe a commercial where an enslaved woman hides in an attic for years to avoid rape. … Perhaps a commercial where your owner sells your spouse far away to have better access to raping you. So many cool stories to be discovered in our family tree. So many great commercials to be made.” Another recent Ancestry ad, “ The Journey ,” imagines an Irish family making the decision to go to Canada during the mid-19 th -century famine in Ireland. In this scenario, which is filmed on a grimy city street that looks suspiciously similar to the one hosting the young interracial lovers in “Inseparable,” the mother convinces the father to leave, despite his sentimental attachment to his parents’ graves, arguing that their boy needs food. This ad isn’t blatantly offensive the way “Inseparable” is, but it illustrates a larger principle: Genealogy companies like Ancestry are selling their services by crafting a certain rosy vision of what history was like. Your ancestors were wise, and patriotic, and worked hard, and sacrificed a lot so that you could end up where you are. Their lives unfolded because of their choices, and not because of things that were done to them. They always loved each other and loved their children. In this sales pitch, the news you’ll get when you look deeper into your family’s history is always good. The past that’s waiting for you to discover was a multicultural utopia, where love conquered all; it’s a 21 st -century fantasy of the possibility of “color-blind” human connection, projected back into a 19 th -century context. In its blinkered optimism, this vision of “ancestry” is as white as white can be. "
This Week in Brexit: The competition to replace Theresa May is on.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/brexit-sajid-javid-boris-johnson-nigel-farage.html,"The Mueller Report Is an Irrefutable Case That Trump Is Unfit for Office With the pace of Brexit news slowing a bit after last week’s extension, we’re rebranding Today in Brexit as This Week in Brexit. Previous posts are here and an explainer on how Britain got into this mess is here . This week in leadership contests : After securing a six-month Brexit extension last week, and with Parliament in recess, Prime Minister Theresa May spent this week walking in Wales , which sounds lovely. Less lovely: Back in London, a whole lot of people are scheming to take her job. May has previously suggested she would step down either after delivering Brexit or if she was unable to do so by this summer, which would require Britain to take part in EU elections. This is Brexit, so no promises are binding, and the Conservative Party can’t actually hold a vote to force her out until December, since it tried and failed to do that last December. Still, with cross-party Brexit talks between May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn seemingly making little headway, pressure on her to resign is likely to grow in the coming months, especially if the Conservatives get shellacked in local elections next month. For Brexiteers, replacing May could be the last option for getting the “hard Brexit” scenario—a full separation from the EU, its customs union, and its regulations—that she now seems intent on preventing. Officially, there’s no leadership contest going on right now, but a few people are already positioning themselves to take May’s job. Home Secretary Sajid Javid made what was billed as a major speech on knife crime this week. The speech connected a call for early intervention to prevent young people from falling into crime with details from Javid’s own working-class upbringing in an immigrant community. It was widely seen as a step toward a bid to succeed May. Javid was mildly pro-Remain ahead of the referendum but has since been more in the Brexiteer camp. Former London Mayor and Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, who left May’s Cabinet over disagreements on Brexit policy, also laid down a marker this week with an op-ed (paywalled) in the Telegraph warning politicians that they would face the wrath of voters if they couldn’t deliver Brexit. “The only way to cure our Brexchosis is to do what we promised the people—to leave the EU, and do it properly,” he wrote. Johnson also got in a spat with Labour MP David Lammy, who likened him to Steve Bannon and Viktor Orban and equated his views to “far-right fascism.” Other likely contenders for the job include former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, current Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, and Environment Secretary Michael Gove. This week in no party like a Brexit Party: Arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, launched his new Brexit Party last Friday to contest the upcoming EU elections. (This is assuming that Britain actually takes part in the elections, in which residents of EU countries vote for their representatives to the European Parliament. May is still saying that she wants to get a Brexit deal completed before then, though that’s looking pretty unlikely now.) Remarkably, the brand-new party is leading in a recent poll , with 27 percent compared with 22 percent for Labour and 15 percent for the Conservatives. Voters tend to use European elections for protest votes so, ironically, they’ve helped raise the profile of fringe euroskeptic parties. As the leader of UKIP, Farage played a key role in making Brexit happen, mainly by pressuring the Conservatives to adopt many of its positions, including holding the 2016 referendum in the first place. He quit UKIP last year , saying it had been taken over by the far right and had become obsessed with Islam. The new Brexit Party’s candidates in the upcoming election including the gloriously named Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of the hard-line Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. This week in no deal: Sky News reported last week that following the extension, the government’s contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit was now being wound down, citing a leaked email. As Sky reported, “the government has spent £2bn on Brexit preparations and redeployed thousands of civil servants away from their normal jobs to work in no-deal related work.” May responded to the report with an email to civil servants, obtained by the Guardian , saying that planning for leaving the EU without a deal should continue. For political reasons, it makes sense that May doesn’t want to take the prospect of no-deal off the table entirely, but after last week it’s pretty clear that she’s willing to do whatever it takes to prevent it. If she’s no longer in power, obviously, it’s a different matter. This week in Northern Ireland: Throughout the Brexit negotiations, one of the major dilemmas has been finding a way for the U.K. to leave the union without creating a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. After decades of sectarian violence, the region has enjoyed an uneasy period of peace since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. As journalist Katie DeRosa recently wrote in a dispatch for Slate, a hard Brexit “could throw a bomb into the Good Friday Agreement, fueling fears it could mobilize paramilitary groups such as the New IRA, which oppose any customs checks between the north and the south.” In a tragic demonstration of what this kind of violence can look like, 29-year-old investigative journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead amid rioting in Derry, also known as Londonderry. The rioting was started after police raids meant to prevent attacks by nationalist militants to commemorate the 1916 Easter Rising. Police are calling McKee’s killing a “terrorist incident” and say it was likely carried out by the New IRA. McKee was working on a book about the disappearance of young people during the long period of violence known as the Troubles. As the politicians squabble in London, the incident is a reminder of the potential human stakes of the decisions being taken. Days left until next deadline: 196 Support our journalism

Robert Mueller cited Scalia to investigate Trump for obstructing justice.,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/robert-mueller-scalia-obstruction-justice-corrupt.html,"The Other Thing the Mueller Report Proved: Journalists Were Right Special counsel Robert Mueller’s assessment of Donald Trump’s efforts to obstruct justice hinged in part on one key question: whether the president can even commit obstruction of justice in the first place. Trump’s defenders, including William Barr (before he became Trump’s attorney general and personal bodyguard ), consistently claimed that prosecutors had no business assessing the president’s motives in exercising his sweeping constitutional powers. To commit obstruction, Trump had to act with “corrupt intent.” But does the special counsel have any authority to evaluate the president’s actions for unlawful intent if he can justify them with some neutral pretext? Yes, Mueller answered emphatically in his report. To do so, he deployed various constitutional and statutory analysis—including, notably, a citation to an opinion by Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. That opinion helps illuminate the legal assumptions that underpinned Mueller’s suggestion that Trump obstructed justice, as well as his argument that the Justice Department could in fact investigate a sitting president for the crime of obstruction. There are three elements in the federal crime of obstruction: an obstructive act, some kind of nexus between that act and an official proceeding (current or pending), and corrupt intent. This last element, corrupt intent, posed a problem for Mueller. Many actions that the special counsel assessed as possible evidence of obstruction were, on their face, legal. For instance, under the Constitution, the president clearly has the power to fire a subordinate in the executive branch, so his termination of FBI Director James Comey was not obviously unlawful. But what if Trump fired Comey for unscrupulous reasons? Specifically, what if he dismissed Comey in an effort to stymie the investigation into his conduct during the 2106 election, as Trump himself later implied ? In that case, could Trump’s “corrupt intent” render his action unlawful obstruction? Yes, Mueller concluded, citing, among other things, Scalia’s 1995 opinion in United States v. Aguilar . That case involved the conviction of a federal judge for illegally disclosing a secret wiretap then lying to FBI agents about his leak. Aguilar turned, in part, on the definition of “corruptly,” and Scalia wrote that the word “has a long standing and well accepted meaning” in criminal law. Quoting from law dictionary and precedent, Scalia wrote that “corruptly” denotes an “act done with an intent to give some advantage inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.” (Emphasis mine.) Mueller then wrote:
That standard parallels the President’s constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws. And virtually everything that the President does in the routine conduct of office will have a clear governmental purpose and will not be contrary to his official duty. Thus, only in truly exceptional cases will prosecutors be able to glean corrupt intent behind seemingly proper or “routine conduct of office.” And the special counsel’s decision to gauge Trump’s intent will not chill the president’s actions, because “in virtually all instances, there will be no credible basis for suspecting a corrupt personal motive.” Of all the cases Mueller could cite to make this point, why the Scalia opinion in Aguilar ? It is not actually an opinion for the court but rather a partial dissent, not a binding authority. But this citation serves two useful purposes. First, it clarifies that in federal criminal law, individuals, including government officials, can engage in obstruction when they commit a seemingly lawful act with illicit motive. After all, the law contemplates an individual having some“official duty” with which he acts inconsistently. If, for example, the president purports to exercise his Article II authority to terminate unsatisfactory subordinates, but actually fires an underlying to impede an investigation into his campaign, he may have acted “inconsistent with official duty” and therefore with the necessary corruption to obstruct justice. Second, by bolstering his argument with wise words from Scalia, Mueller preemptively neutralized some inevitable criticism that his report failed to respect the presidency. Scalia was a proponent of the “unitary executive” theory, which endorses vast powers for the president. And the famed conservative jurist is a model for Trump’s archconservative judicial nominees. Yet Scalia’s Aguilar opinion seems to fortify Mueller’s rationale for investigating Trump’s ostensibly officials acts, forestalling complaints that the special counsel’s obstruction probe chilled the president’s freedom to govern. In the end, Mueller concluded that he did not gather sufficient evidence to determine whether a “reasonable inference” could show that Trump fired Comey with corrupt intent. He did, however, write that a number of Trump’s other actions , including his efforts to manipulate then–Attorney General Jeff Sessions, arguably qualified as obstructing justice. If Trump had untrammeled authority to boss around his subordinates, regardless of intent, Mueller’s inquiries into these episodes would’ve been pointless. But as Scalia seemed to recognize, an official act can still carry a corrupt intent when it is performed “inconsistent with an official duty.” And Trump had a duty to execute the laws—not protect himself and his associates from investigation.

Joe Biden presidential campaign: Is the 2020 favorite better in theory or practice?,slate.com,Josh Voorhees,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/joe-biden-2020-presidential-campaign-key-question.html,"Even if Democratic Leaders Wanted to “Stop Bernie” … Could They? Joe Biden has finally made up his mind and is ready to share it with the world. So says the Atlantic , which reported Friday that the former vice president will officially kick off his presidential campaign next week. Reports that Biden’s launch is imminent have been a staple of political coverage this year, but this one— confirmed by the Associated Press —has the kind of details that suggests this is not a drill: Biden plans to announce on Wednesday with a video featuring footage shot two weeks ago outside his old family home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and will then follow it up at some point in the near future with a kickoff rally, possibly at either the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which would make for a cutesy Rocky-themed launch, or in Charlottesville, Virginia, which would call for a far more serious one. The former veep has been teasing a run more or less since the day after the 2016 election, but he’s spent 2019 in a liminal space as both the hypothetical polling front-runner and not yet a real-life candidate. That was by design. It allowed Biden to loom over the field while also affording him the opportunity to respond to complaints about his handsiness with women—criticism his team knew was coming—from the controlled safety of his couch and the stage instead of at a freewheeling town hall or press conference. It’s too early to say that his inappropriate touching won’t hurt Biden with voters, but the evidence we have suggests it hasn’t hurt him yet. On March 29, the day Lucy Flores came forward with her story of him putting his hands on her shoulders and kissing the back of her head before a political rally in 2014, Biden sat at 30.3 percent in the RealClearPolitics’ average of national polls , about 8 percentage points ahead of Bernie Sanders and 21 points ahead of Kamala Harris and Beto O’Rourke. The three weeks since have brought a number of similar stories of Biden invading a woman’s personal space, and yet his polling position remains almost identical: at an even 30 percent, roughly 8 percentage points ahead of Sanders, 21 ahead of O’Rourke, and 22 ahead of Harris. Likewise, Biden’s approval rating remains sky high and limited second-choice surveys suggest he remains the top fallback option for those supporting the three candidates closest to him in the polls. Many voters, particularly older ones , appear willing to give Biden the benefit of the doubt. I’m on record about my fear that Biden will enter the race with so much goodwill among Democrats from his time as President Barack Obama’s sidekick that he won’t be forced to fully reckon with his past, which among other things includes: his opposition to school integration in the 1970s, his turn as a drug warrior and incarceration hawk in the 1980s, his mishandling of the Anita Hill hearings and help passing the Clinton crime bill in the 1990s, and his support of the Iraq war in the 2000s. Biden’s cringe-worthy reaction to criticism about his inappropriate touching, meanwhile, is just the latest evidence that the 76-year-old is stuck in the past. He loves to wax nostalgic about the bipartisan days of yore, seemingly unable to grasp that the friends he made back then were segregationists like Strom Thurmond and Jesse Helms, or that Congress was so male-dominated when he first arrived in Washington that it would take another two decades before women got their own restroom off the Senate floor. Still, Biden’s formal entrance into the race will answer what is, to my mind, the biggest question in the Democratic primary: Is the former VP as strong in practice as he is in theory? His first White House run ended in a plagiarism scandal, and his second included a tone-deaf description of the man who would become the nation’s first black president as “articulate and bright and clean.” But while the current version of Biden admits he’s still a “gaffe machine,” it’s hard to imagine those past gaffes being considered disqualifying in the age of Trump. This will also be the first time he’s running since he became the kind of Democratic folk hero that liberals write fan fiction about . His plan all along has been to present himself as the elder statesman in the field, one who can be the steady hand needed to restore a sense of normalcy to the nation. That’s a message that may resonate a little louder coming just days after Robert Mueller painted a detailed picture of a president who lies and then asks others to lie about those lies. If Biden hits the ground running, he could consolidate support from the Democratic establishment, particularly the large swath that is increasingly afraid of Sanders and eager to rally around a centrist alternative. That wouldn’t shield the former veep from criticism from progressives unhappy with his preferred half-measures on issues like health care, but it would likely help expand his base. The primary electorate has its fair share of moderates , and voters are currently preoccupied with nominating the candidate with the best chance of beating Trump. The answer to that question is unknowable at this point, but many voters will take their cues from party leaders. The party’s rank-and-file could get their first long look at Biden since he left Washington two-plus years ago and fail to feel the pangs of Obama nostalgia Biden is banking on. Or Biden could step on stage in Philadelphia or Charlottesville and turn out to be exactly what he’s looked like all along: the favorite, but a flawed one. Either way, the waiting will officially be over and the 2020 race will have unofficially begun. Support our journalism

Don McGahn disobeying Donald Trump doesn’t absolve the president of a crime.,slate.com,Jennifer Taub,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/don-mcgahn-trump-orders-mueller-crimes.html,"The Mueller Report Makes It Clear: Trump Is Off the Hook in SDNY as Well When it comes to obstruction of justice, did the president’s team really “save him from himself” as some analysts have put it? Since Thursday’s release of the Mueller report, commentators in print and on cable news have suggested that but for these resisters, Trump would have committed the felony of obstruction. This is the wrong conclusion to draw from the report. The confusion may stem from the following statement on Page 158 of Volume II. Here, Mueller wrote: “The President’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.” This disobedient group included high-level officials—FBI Director James Comey and White House counsel Don McGahn—as well as seeming longtime loyalists Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn. In each case Mueller cited, the president ordered these surrogates—either directly or via another surrogate—to take some extraordinary action to obstruct the Russia probe, and in each case he was rebuffed. This paragraph, though, has given rise to the belief that when someone’s “efforts to influence” a proceeding fail, there are no grounds for obstruction. Not so. The federal statute and case law make this clear. An attempt to obstruct that fails is still a crime. Why can failure be a felony? For the answer, let’s explore one of the obstruction provisions that Mueller referenced, 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2) . This passage provides that “Whoever corruptly … obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both” (emphasis added). Making a criminal charge under this and the other relevant obstruction statutes (1503, 1505, and 1512(b)(3) requires allegations of (1) an obstructive act; (2) a close connection (or nexus) with an official proceeding; and (3) a corrupt intent. Or, as Attorney General William Barr acknowledged in his four-page letter to congressional leaders in March, “Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding.” Why can failure be a felony? The Mueller report provides proof of all three elements needed to establish obstruction on several potential counts of obstruction. This analysis carefully tracks the statutory language describing an obstruction offense. The report sets out 10 potentially obstructive episodes. In nearly all of them, it establishes a nexus to an official proceeding. The proceedings included, for example, a pending or foreseeable grand jury investigation, a criminal prosecution arising out of the FBI investigation, the special counsel investigation, the congressional investigations, and the investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York. Mueller also states in the report that the president did at some point have influence on the special counsel’s investigation itself, even though most of his efforts to influence it failed. Back to the now popular expression that Trump’s team saved him from himself. Not so. Ultimately, both successful and unsuccessful efforts to influence an official proceeding violate the obstruction statute if done with corrupt intent. As Mueller makes clear on Page 11 of the second volume, under Section 1512(c), a person is “guilty of an attempt when he has the intent to commit a substantive offense and takes an overt act that constitutes a substantial step towards that goal.” He then went on to cite precedent that “ ‘soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an element of the crime’ may qualify as a substantial step.’ ” In other words, even his close associates could not save the president from himself. The final problem for Mueller, though, in presenting evidence that Trump violated the law—which this report certainly does—was showing that corrupt intent without having had the opportunity to question the president because of Trump’s recalcitrance and Mueller’s decision not to issue a subpoena. Ultimately, Mueller settled on an approach where he believed that there was enough evidence he had gathered and in the public record to demonstrate that intent. It’s partially why he was so meticulous in documenting Trump lie after Trump lie, which in several cases pointed to evidence of a guilty conscience. Given that Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein sought to absolve the president of obstruction in Barr’s four-page summary letter—when Mueller did no such thing—where does that leave things? On the very first page of the report’s second volume, Mueller provided an answer. He wrote, “while the OLC opinion concludes that a sitting president may not be prosecuted, it recognizes that a president does not have immunity after he leaves office.” He repeated this again in a footnote at the end of the report that it would “serve the usual purposes of the criminal law” to prosecute a president after he has left office. More likely, though, at least in the short term, the question of whether or not Trump has obstructed justice will be left to Congress. Support our journalism

Trump impeachment: Why Elizabeth Warren wants House to start impeachment proceedings against president.,slate.com,Josh Voorhees,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/elizabeth-warren-donald-trump-impeachment.html,"So Is Impeachment Plausible, Necessary, or Stupid? Elizabeth Warren on Friday became the first major presidential contender to call for the House to begin impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. The Massachusetts senator laid out her rationale in a series of afternoon tweets , which together read:
The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help. Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack.
Mueller put the next step in the hands of Congress: “Congress has authority to prohibit a President’s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.” The correct process for exercising that authority is impeachment.
To ignore a President’s repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, and it would suggest that both the current and future Presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways.
The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty. That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States. Warren isn’t the first elected official to ring the impeachment bell in the wake of the report’s release Thursday— that honor goes to progressive Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Ayanna Pressley. But Warren is now at odds with her party’s leadership, which wants to proceed far more slowly . She also stands alone in a 2020 field in which the other Democratic hopefuls have limited themselves to demanding Congress see the unredacted version and hear directly from Mueller. I remain skeptical that the issue of impeachment will become a defining issue in the Democratic primary. It’s somewhere between difficult and impossible to build a presidential campaign on the promise of impeaching the president—both because impeachment is the responsibility of the House, and because the need to impeach would become moot the very moment the next president is sworn in. Furthermore, even if a candidate did find a way to square that circle, it’s not clear it would pay off in either the primary or the general election. Democratic voters seem to care significantly less about the Russia investigation than they do about other issues like healthcare, immigration, and climate change, and the U.S. electorate as whole appears even less interested. Still, in a crowded field currently dominated by Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Warren’s willingness to even utter the word impeachment will likely earn her a flurry of media coverage, which in turn will give primary voters a second look at her. Many might like what they see: An outspoken progressive who is proposing bold yet specific action. In that regard, Warren’s call for the House to begin impeachment proceedings is in line with her bounty of ambitious policy proposals on everything from childcare to taxes. In each case, she’s identifying a serious problem and proposing to use the levers of government to fix it. Meanwhile, campaign aside, there’s also something to be said for Warren simply doing the job she was elected to—regardless of what it means for her next one. Support our journalism

She had never so much as volunteered for a political candidate when Donald Trump tapped her, at age 26, to be his campaign’s press secretary in 2015. At the time, she seemed like the ne plus ultra of a Trump hire: a young, glamorous model who worked for his daughter’s clothing company. It wasn’t hard to see why Trump picked her. It was hard to imagine why a woman with no obvious ideological ax to grind would stunt her nascent career in public relations by signing on with a PR disaster. After the release of a redacted version of Robert Mueller’s special counsel report on Thursday, it’s gotten a lot easier to comprehend Hicks’ motives. She emerged as a somewhat unexpected breakout star of the report, a candid source for investigators who shed light on the president’s unwillingness to take his aides’ advice and confront inevitable consequences. The Hicks of the Mueller report is a capable PR professional who tried her darnedest to protect her boss from his worst impulses, advocated for him when appropriate, and ultimately stood on the side of truth and decency. At least, that’s according to Hicks. The anecdotes that make Hicks look adept and intelligent all come from the same source: Hope Hicks. There are at least two instances where Hicks recounted for investigators—with no corroborating accounts from anyone else—how hard she worked to get Trump to stop saying obstruction-y things to the press. After Trump hinted in a pre-taped interview with Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo that he might ask James Comey to resign his FBI post, Hicks claims to have told him they should have Fox remove the quote from the final broadcast version. “But the President wanted to keep it in, which Hicks thought was unusual,” the report says. A few months later, Trump gave an “unplanned interview” to the New York Times, in which he badmouthed then–Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation. Here’s how the report says it went down: “Hicks, who was present for the interview, recalled trying to ‘throw [herself) between the reporters and [the President]’ to stop parts of the interview, but the President ‘loved the interview.’ ” What an American, making a human wall of herself to preserve the integrity of the special counsel’s investigation! What a communications director, pulling a Secret Service–taking-a-bullet move to prevent her client from making a fool, or criminal, of himself! There’s nothing to suggest Hicks didn’t take these smart (if no-brainer) steps in the course of her duties. But the Hicks who emerges in these anecdotes only bears responsibility for the heroic behind-the-scenes efforts to contain Trump, not any of the bad stuff she surely commended, ignored, or egged him on to do. During Trump’s campaign and presidency, Hicks was one of the few people trusted with helping craft Trump’s tweets, which have famously bullied private citizens, fomented hate for Muslims and immigrants, made sexist cracks at women who criticized him, and edged the country closer to a nuclear showdown. According to one Trump campaign official , some of Trump’s most merciless Twitter insults have come from Hicks’ keyboard. The Mueller report does contain one challenge to Hicks’ glowing account of her own tenure. It concerns a conversation in summer 2017, when Hicks made a valiant effort to get Trump to understand the potential damage that could be inflicted by the emails setting up a June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr., other campaign staffers, and a Kremlin-linked attorney. Hicks “recalled being shocked by the emails,” and tried to convince Trump to release them before they could leak and suggested arranging a “softball interview” with Trump Jr. Hicks says, per the report, that she was stymied by Trump, who was convinced the emails would never leak and wanted to keep them private. Here, Hicks sounds like a solid crisis communications strategist who wants to show the public that Trump and his family have nothing to hide. And her story may be true. But another Trump staffer contradicts her account. Former Trump legal team spokesman Mark Corallo produced notes for investigators from a conversation he had with Hicks and Trump after the New York Times ran a piece on the Trump Tower meeting. Regarding the emails Hicks said she tried to get Trump to release, Corallo wrote, “Hope says ‘only a few people have [them]. [They] will never get out.’ ” Hicks told investigators she didn’t remember saying that—or maybe she did, and she was simply “channeling the President.” The Mueller report has given Hicks and her former colleagues the opportunity to write themselves into the first draft of the Trump chapter of U.S. history, and no one’s compiled a better press release for themselves than Hicks. In talking to investigators, she studiously followed the advice she says she gave Trump: She got out ahead of the story and set her own narrative before anyone else could define her time in the administration. The parts of Hicks’ story that might reflect poorly on her character—her admission to House investigators that she’s told “ white lies ” for Trump, for instance—don’t make it into the Mueller report. Those aspects of her narrative will now be buried under this substantive and politically powerful document. Hicks’ accounts of trying to protect Trump from himself speak volumes about her PR acumen. Her ability to shovel those accounts into a widely read and highly trusted public record says even more. Support our journalism

Immigrants Can Be Denied Citizenship for Working in Legal Marijuana Industry,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/immigrants-denied-citizenship-legal-marijuana.html,"So Is Impeachment Plausible, Necessary, or Stupid? Green-card holders may want to think twice about celebrating 4/20 too publicly this year. That is because U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued guidance a day before the unofficial marijuana holiday that makes clear working in the marijuana industry, or even just possessing cannabis could be grounds to reject a citizenship application—regardless of whether it is done in a state where it is legal. Violations of federal marijuana laws “are generally a bar to establishing good moral character for naturalization, even where that conduct would not be an offense under state law,” according to the guidance issued Friday . Merely being “involved in certain marijuana-related activities” could be sign that an applicant for citizenship “may lack good moral character” regardless of whether “such activity has been decriminalized under applicable state laws,” according to the USCIS statement. mmigration lawyers who work in states where marijuana is legal say they have been dealing with this issue for a while now, leading Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock to send a letter to Attorney General William Barr asking for clarification about policies that have been affecting immigrants. This isn’t just a theoretical issue either. CNN reports that two immigrants who have lived in the United States for more than two decades were told they were not eligible for naturalization due to their work in the marijuana industry . “I work hard in an industry that offers opportunity and that’s unquestionably legal within the state. For the government to deny my citizenship application because I’m a bad person is devastating,” one affected immigrant tells CNN. Advocates for legalization say the guidance is more a reflection of the government’s anti-immigrant attitude than about drugs. “I don’t think this is about marijuana at all,” said Michael Collins, national affairs director of the Drug Policy Alliance . “I think this is about them using the war on drugs to go after migrant community and that’s what they’ve been doing since Day 1.” A total of 33 states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana while 10 states and D.C. have legalized recreational marijuana.

Vermont likely to become third state to officially scrap Columbus Day for Indigenous Peoples’ Day.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/vermont-to-officially-scrap-columbus-day-indigenous-peoples-day.html,"So Is Impeachment Plausible, Necessary, or Stupid? Columbus Day is likely to be a thing of the past in Vermont in the near future. The Vermont Legislature passed a bill on Wednesday that would permanently recognize the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day and Gov. Phil Scott said he’ll likely sign it into law. “I see no reason that I would not sign it,” Scott told the Burlington Free Press , “but we’re reviewing the bill as we speak.” Vermont actually hasn’t celebrated Columbus Day for a few years. Former Gov. Peter Shumlin signed a gubernatorial proclamation in 2016 recognizing Indigenous Peoples’ Day and that continued even after the current Republican governor took office. But the measure now awaiting the governor’s signature would do away with Columbus Day altogether, turning Vermont into the third state to legally rename the holiday after New Mexico and South Dakota. Alaska is in a special circumstance because it never actually recognized Columbus Day as a holiday but did declare Indigenous Peoples’ Day a state holiday in 2017. Many cities around the country have also moved to rename the Columbus Day holiday as a way of honoring indigenous people and recognizing that the history many learned in school ignored the brutality of colonization. “Things that are symbolic can carry very far,” Rich Holschuh, a member of the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs, told the Burlington Free Press. “The degree of disinformation and lack of understanding around the situation of native people in Vermont, as a microcosm of the national situation, is totally exemplified in the way that Columbus has been celebrated and the native people ignored.” Maine is likely to follow suit and be the next state to do away with Columbus Day after Maine’s Senate gave the final approval to a bill that would rename the holiday on Thursday. Gov. Janet Mills, whose administration has previously expressed support for the measure, would now need to sign the bill to turn it into law. Oami Amarasingham, policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine celebrated the decision by state lawmakers. “It’s time to stop celebrating a man whose arrival brought death, disease and slavery to hundreds of thousands, and start honoring the people who lived here long before,” Amarasingham, said .

Ben Simmons vs. Jared Dudley: Who's winning this bizarre feud?,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/ben-simmons-vs-jared-dudley-nets-sixers.html,"The Best College Gymnast in America Is Also the Most Hated Were it not for the playoffs, Ben Simmons and Jared Dudley would exist as two distant planets in the vast expanses of the NBA universe. Simmons is an All-Star and one of the league’s brightest young talents. Dudley is a 33-year-old journeyman who was traded to the Brooklyn Nets last summer for Darrell Arthur. The postseason provides its own gravity, though, and these two seemingly unrelated entities have collided during the Philadelphia 76ers’ first-round matchup with the Brooklyn Nets. Somehow, the two are in the midst of an honest-to-goodness beef. A fabled beef, even. — Howard Beck (@HowardBeck) April 20, 2019 How did we get here? Who’s winning this bizarre (and fabled) showdown? The inciting incident. After Philadelphia evened up the series in Game 2, Dudley—who sat out that contest with a calf injury—talked to reporters about the team’s strategy for slowing Simmons down. “ Ben Simmons is a great player in transition ,” he said. “And once you get him into half court, he’s average.” Simmons’ rejoinder. When asked about the evaluation, Simmons scoffed. “That’s coming from Jared Dudley,” he said. “Come on.” #Sixers PG @BenSimmons25 responds to Jared Dudley’s comment about the #NBAAllStar being “average” in half court. pic.twitter.com/0BQTtHOnUL — Keith Pompey (@PompeyOnSixers) April 18, 2019 Simmons may have been dismissive of Dudley to reporters, but he was pointedly aggressive in Game 3, putting up 31 points and 9 assists in the Sixers’ win. Dudley, meanwhile, scored 0 points in 17 minutes, and Simmons looked particularly pleased after Dudley airballed a shot from behind the arc. Ben Simmons had fun trolling Jared Dudley after Dudley called him an “average” half-court player 🙃 pic.twitter.com/SYJdgJLOrP When asked about the beef after the game, Simmons gave his answer from the passing lane of the high road. “I don’t really have energy for it,” he said. “It’s done.” Dudley’s response. “Saturday’s Game 4 was a quiet affair, and both parties respectfully kept to themselves.” So begins the latest entry in my wildly unpopular basketball fan fiction series, NBA Players Getting Along . In reality, Dudley was a pest all afternoon, and he reacted to a made 3-pointer with the same celebration Simmons had used for Dudley’s Game 3 airball. Jared Dudley had a message for Ben Simmons 😂 #WeGoHard | #NBAPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/90FR34uRe3 — NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) April 20, 2019 Dudley was probably still feeling the adrenaline rush of that made field goal when he got in the face of Sixers center Joel Embiid in the third quarter. He and Simmons tumbled into the crowd during the ensuing tussle, and the officials ejected Dudley and the Sixers’ Jimmy Butler, the latter of whom helped escalate the argument from a skirmish to a full-blown scuttlebutt. This left Simmons to continue the game without his foil, and he finished with 15 points, 8 assists, and 8 rebounds in a 112-108 win for Philadelphia. Who’s winning the feud? Simmons provided two key plays for the Sixers down the stretch. First, he found an open J.J. Redick for a go-ahead jumper. (Note: this kind of occurred in a half-court setting.) JJ knocks down the BIG triple when it counts! Sixers up 1! 🔥 #PhilaUnite | #NBAPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/GgFaCKZ5ei — NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) April 20, 2019 Then, after the teams traded 3-pointers, Simmons stole the ball from Jarrett Allen and secured the win for Philly. Despite these late-game heroics, it’s obvious that the winner of the Simmons-Dudley showdown is Jared Dudley. Dudley averaged 4.9 points per game during the regular season. He is averaging 3 points in the postseason. The fact that he’s been able to generate a feud out of thin air despite those meager stats is a truly remarkable accomplishment. The Sixers and Ben Simmons may be up 3 games to 1, but Dudley has already managed the upset of the postseason."
Berry Tramel describes Russell Westbrook's icy relationship with the Oklahoma City media.,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/russell-westbrook-berry-tramel-next-question-2019-playoffs.html,"The Best College Gymnast in America Is Also the Most Hated The Oklahoma City Thunder clawed their way back into their first round playoff series with the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday with to a 120-108 victory. It was a hard-fought affair and, during the postgame press conference, Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook was asked about both teams’ choppy starts in the first half. “Next question,” he grumbled. The reporter continued his inquiry, but Westbrook remained silent. ""You want me to tell him...?"" PG to Russ as Westbrook continues feud with Oklahoman columnist pic.twitter.com/aEfyz6VALD — NBC Sports Northwest (@NBCSNorthwest) April 20, 2019 Westbrook’s ire had less to do with the innocuous question than with the reporter who asked it. Berry Tramel is a columnist for the Oklahoman and has been covering sports in the state for over 40 years. Westbrook’s one-sided rivalry with Tramel dates back to at least 2015 when, during a postgame scrum, he told the writer, “I just don’t like you.” That year, Bryan Curtis used the incident as the central hook for a Grantland feature about how the Thunder organization coddles and shields its players from the media. “That’s not really Russ’s fault, I don’t think,” Tramel told Curtis at the time. “I think the culture created that.” A lot has happened in the years since—Kevin Durant left, Westbrook won an MVP—but little has changed with the team’s relationship with the press, and with Westbrook’s relationship with Tramel. During the 2017 playoffs, Westbrook took exception to the columnist’s question (which had been directed to Thunder center Steven Adams) about why the Thunder played poorly when the team’s star point guard went to the bench. Westbrook’s “next question” on Friday night may have gotten a lot of attention, but it’s not a new tactic. Earlier this month, Tramel wrote a column in which he referenced Westbrook’s penchant for telling the writer “next question,” and explained why he continues to quiz the Thunder star. “I think Westbrook puts on a façade during the season, and when it’s an interview relationship, he’s playing a character and won’t give an inch. He’s playing the intimidator,” Tramel wrote. “So I’ll keep asking questions, because he’s giving me no other choice.” I reached Tramel by phone on Saturday to ask him about Friday’s interaction, how the Thunder organization has handled it, and what it’s like to be next question -ed by Westbrook. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. Nick Greene: Do you think Thunder PR will reach out to you now that Friday’s interaction has become a national story? Berry Tramel: I assume not. Frankly, I thought it had gone national even before last night. Once the playoffs got here it sort of snowballed. Somebody told me that I was trending on Twitter even though I don’t really know what that means. I didn’t expect anything to happen after last night. Certainly nothing has. Did you expect Westbrook to give you a response on Friday because it was at the podium and not in the locker room? No. I knew. The same thing happened in Portland for Games 1 and 2. He’s been doing that for the last three months. I didn’t think it would change with the playoffs, but I didn’t know for sure. Do you have any idea of what happened three months ago to spark this? Three months ago they played the Lakers. He’s been struggling from the foul line this year and with 2 seconds left in the game he drew a three-shot foul and made all three to send the game into overtime . After the game someone asked him about his struggles at the free throw line, and he basically didn’t answer the question. So I asked him about how he found the confidence to make three with the game on the line even though he hadn’t been shooting well from the line. And he basically didn’t answer again. I responded by saying, “You not only don’t want to talk about the free throws you miss, you don’t want to talk about the free throws you make.” I was just trying to be funny and bring a little levity to the situation. He sort of glared at me. He never looks at people when they ask him questions, so when he looks at you you know he’s upset. Since then, he’s been saying “next question.” What does it feel like to be stonewalled like that? Does it get easier the more it happens? It’s not a big deal to me. I find the whole thing a little bit humorous. I find it interesting that it’s such a big deal to everybody because he’s really been doing this for years and years. Not always to me, but he’s always combative with the media. I don’t really see what the big news is. Later in the press conference, Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts singled you out and said he’d answer your question , which was a pretty funny moment. Do you find that people with other teams take notice of the fraught OKC-press relationship? Stotts was the first one from another team to reference it that I know about. We’re sort of secluded here in Oklahoma. They follow the games and Westbrook is a wonderful player, but as far as his dealings with the Oklahoma media, nobody pays attention to that until the playoffs. I’m not aware of any other teams even knowing about it, until Terry Stotts said what he said. The Thunder have enjoyed success since moving to Oklahoma City. Do you think if the team were less successful then they would be more open with the press? I think the Thunder believes that they’re in pretty good standing with the media, outside of Westbrook. And maybe they are. As far as I know, there’s never been any serious rifts between any media and any player besides Westbrook. Kevin Durant might get mad at somebody, Kendrick Perkins might get mad at somebody. Dennis Schröder got mad at somebody this year. But they get over it. It doesn’t linger. Westbrook’s different. He likes to invent enemies. He does it on the court, does it in media scrums. I guess it fuels him. The Thunder, by league standards, are a pretty insular franchise. But, with that said, the NBA still provides incredible access to interviews. You can talk to most people most any day you want to. The problem with the Thunder is that there are hardly any one-on-one interviews. There’s hardly any opportunity to get to know each other. The first time Westbrook ever showed any type of disdain for me, I came away sort of encouraged because it was the first time I had any acknowledgement that he knew who I was. There’s no relationship there. I’m not talking about being friends or going out to lunch. I’m talking about knowing each other’s names. Having a professional relationship. There’s very little of that going on with the Thunder. That’s by design. They want to keep everything as player-friendly as they can. You’ve never had a chance to have any one-on-one time with Westbrook during all the time both of you have spent in Oklahoma City? Oh, good lord! Oh my goodness, no. If you get an opportunity to ask him a question after the game on Sunday, what percentage of a chance do you think there is that he’ll answer it? Zero. He’s not going to give in, if that’s your question. He’s not going to give in this playoff series. I’ll give in way before he gives in. He’s way more mentally tough than I am."
United Constitutional Patriots: FBI arrests head of armed militia group that was detaining migrants at border.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/united-constitutional-patriots-fbi-arrests-head-of-militia.html,"Hope Hicks Says Hope Hicks Was Great at Her Job. Should We Trust Her? The FBI arrested on Saturday the head of a right-wing militia that had been detaining migrant families at gunpoint . Law enforcement officers arrested Larry Mitchell Hopkins, who went by the alias Johnny Horton Jr., in New Mexico on charges of firearms possession by a felon. Hopkins had previously been arrested in 2006 on charges of impersonating an officer and for felony firearm possession. “This is a dangerous felon who should not have weapons around children and families,” the New Mexico attorney general, Hector Balderas, said in a statement . “Today’s arrest by the F.B.I. indicates clearly that the rule of law should be in the hands of trained law enforcement officials, not armed vigilantes.” Although the charge isn’t particularly serious, it could open the door to other investigations and sends a clear message regarding the type of vigilante justice the group has been carrying out along the border.

On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union had denounced the actions of the militia and called for authorities to investigate. “We cannot allow racist and armed vigilantes to kidnap and detain people seeking asylum,” two ACLU lawyers wrote in a letter to government officials. In the videos that had been published online, the militia members spoke in favor of a border wall and referred to the arrival of migrants as an “invasion,” echoing language used by President Donald Trump.

Frazer Harrison/Getty Images John Singleton, the screenwriter and director whose 1991 feature debut Boyz n the Hood was a centerpiece of the black film renaissance of the 1990s , was hospitalized earlier this week after suffering a stroke, Variety reports . Singleton checked himself into the hospital after his leg started hurting on a flight to the United States from Costa Rica. Doctors described the stroke as “mild,” according to TMZ . His family confirmed Singleton’s hospitalization in a statement on Saturday:
John is currently in the ICU and under great medical care. We ask that privacy be given to him and our family at this time and appreciate all of the prayers that have been pouring in from his fans, friends, and colleagues. Singleton was the first African-American to be nominated for the Best Director Academy Award for Boyz n the Hood , ultimately losing out to Jonathan Demme for The Silence of the Lambs .His other feature films include Higher Learning , Poetic Justice, the 2000 remake of Shaft , and 2 Fast 2 Furious .

CBS It’s commonplace for movies and TV shows to be dedicated to recently deceased members of the show’s crew, so much so that back in 2000, The Onion ran an editorial ostensibly written by a gaffer on Veronica’s Closet headlined “ Thanks for Dedicating That Mediocre Sitcom Episode to My Memory .” The traditional white-text-on-a-black-screen dedication is a nice gesture, depending on the TV show and the episode, but it doesn’t give any sense of the person the show’s cast and crew are grieving. That’s natural on fictional shows—nobody wants Arli$$ to break character and start eulogizing a set designer in the middle of an exciting new episode of Arli$$— but there’s no reason a talk show can’t do better than that, and on Friday, Stephen Colbert did. Here’s his sweet, teary-eyed tribute to the show’s cameraman John Meiklejohn, who died last Saturday: Odds are good that you have at least one thing in common with world-famous television host Stephen Colbert: Someone in your life whose support means more to you than they know.

Sri Lanka bombings: Blasts at churches and hotels kill hundreds on Easter Sunday.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/sri-lanka-bombings-churches-hotels-easter-sunday.html,"The Supreme Court’s New LGBTQ Cases Could Demolish Sex Discrimination Law as We Know It Bombs struck three churches in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday and three luxury hotels popular with foreign tourists, killing at least 207 people and wounding 450 in what are being described as a series of coordinated terrorist attacks . The death toll has been increasing in quick succession since the blasts and the latest number comes from law enforcement officials . A seventh and eighth bombing Sunday afternoon that took place at private house and another hotel appear to have been carried out by suspects as they were fleeing from police. Seven suspects have been arrested in the attacks that officials say were mostly suicide bombings and marked the deadliest violence to strike the country since the end of the civil war a decade ago. There were at least 27 foreigners, including British, Dutch, and American citizens, among the dead, according to hospital officials. Some of the bombings, which were mostly carried out in or around the capital city of Colombo, at the churches appear to have been timed to hit the highest number of worshippers possible. So far the deadliest explosion appears to have taken place at St. Sebastian’s Church in Negombo , which is about 20 miles north of Colombo. More than 50 people were killed in that blast that blew out much of the church’s roof. The church posted horrific photos showing the aftermath of the blast on Facebook as it appealed for help. The other bombed churches were St. Anthony’s Shrine in Colombo and Zion Church in the eastern city of Batticaloa. “It was a river of blood,” N. A. Sumanapala, a shopkeeper near St. Anthony’s said. “The priest came out and he was covered in blood.” As panic spread to other churches, most stopped or canceled their Easter services. The three high-end hotels targeted in Colombo were: the Shangri-La, the Cinnamon Grand and the Kingsbury. Sri Lankan authorities imposed a curfew and blocked social media networks as they launched a massive security operation to locate the culprits. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks but Defense Minister Ruwan Wijewardena blamed religious extremists for the blasts that rocked a country that once regularly saw bombings in Colombo during a decades-long war with Tamil separatists. Around 70 percent of Sri Lanka’s population of around 22 million are Buddhist, 12.6 percent are Hindu, 9.7 percent, Muslim, and 7.6 percent Christian, according to the 2012 census .

Schiff on Mueller report: “In every way this is more significant than Watergate.”,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/schiff-mueller-report-more-significant-watergate-nixon.html,"Rep. Adam Schiff, the head of the House Intelligence Committee, pushed back against suggestions that the findings in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report somehow aren’t as serious as he and other Democrats had suggested . In particular, the allegations surrounding obstruction of justice that are outlined in the Mueller report are “far worse than anything that Richard Nixon did,” Schiff said. The host of ABC’s This Week , Martha Raddatz, questioned Schiff about his previous statements comparing the actions of the Trump administration to Watergate, leaving the door open for him to take back some of those comments. But Schiff, who has become a favorite target of Republicans ever since Attorney General William Barr released his summary of the Mueller report, made clear that as far as he was concerned his previous statements on the seriousness of the president’s misdeeds continue to stand. Rep. Adam Schiff on the Mueller report and President Trump: ""The obstruction of justice in particular this case is far worse than anything that Richard Nixon did ... so yes, I would say in every way this is more significant than Watergate"" https://t.co/yZdNkbTlSI pic.twitter.com/ijtCWc2w4B — This Week (@ThisWeekABC) April 21, 2019 “The obstruction of justice in particular in this case is far worse than anything that Richard Nixon did,” Schiff said . “The break in by the Russians of the Democratic institutions, a foreign adversary far more significant than the plumbers breaking into the Democratic headquarters. So yes, I would say in every way this is more significant than Watergate.” Beyond that though, Schiff also said that the way Trump “would not only not stand up and resist Russian interference in our election but would welcome it goes well beyond anything Nixon did.” Taking Moscow’s side over those of his own intelligence agencies goes is one of the main reasons why “I think it is far more serious than Watergate.” When asked whether Trump obstructed justice, Schiff said that as far as he’s concerned, there is no doubt about that, noting the obstruction came “in many ways.” Even though Trump’s allies say Mueller’s report exonerates the president, Schiff insists that Mueller “made it abundantly clear he felt he could not indict the president” and beyond that “I think he also felt that he could not say that the president should be indicted, because that would be effectively the same thing.” At the end of the day, Mueller “came as close to saying that the evidence of obstruction was evidence of a crime as he could within the Department of Justice regulations.” . @MarthaRaddatz : ""Do you believe the president did obstruct justice?""Rep.

Michael Avenatti accused of embezzling nearly $2 million NBA star Hassan Whiteside paid to ex girlfriend.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/michael-avenatti-embezzlment-nba-star-hassan-whiteside.html,"The Supreme Court’s New LGBTQ Cases Could Demolish Sex Discrimination Law as We Know It When Miami Heat center Hassan Whiteside wired $2.75 million to celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti in January 2017 it was supposed to cover most of the settlement to prevent a potential lawsuit that had been threatened by his former girlfriend, Alexis Gardner. In the end, most of the cash—$2.5 million—went to help Avenatti buy a share of a private jet, according to the Los Angeles Times . Gardner, an actress and barista, had hired Avenatti to help her reach a settlement with Whiteside and the two quickly came to agree on a $3 million deal. That January 2017 transfer was supposed to be the first payment. Avenatti was entitled to take a little more than $1 million in legal fees, but he did not tell Gardner about the cash. Instead, he told her client she would receive 96 monthly payments over the following eight years. Avenatti then allegedly proceeded to make 11 payments to Gardner, totaling around $194,000 before those stopped and he began claiming that Whiteside was not coming through on his end of the deal. Hassan Whiteside #21 of the Miami Heat motions for the fans to get louder during the final moments of the game against Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center on November 14, 2018 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. Sarah Stier/Getty Images It isn’t clear what the lawsuit between Gardner and Whiteside would have entailed but it does seem they both wanted to keep the whole thing quiet. “We entered into a mutually agreed upon settlement more than two years ago following the end of our relationship; a settlement that reflected Alexis’ investment of time and support over a number of years as Hassan pursued a career in the NBA,” Whiteside and Gardner told the Los Angeles Times in a statement. “It is unfortunate that something that was meant to be kept private between us is now being publicly reported. We have both moved on amicably and wish nothing but the best for each other.” The alleged embezzlement is detailed in the April 10 indictment of Avenatti by a federal grand jury in Santa Ana, California. Last month, prosecutors unveiled a spate of criminal charges against the lawyer who rose to stardom for representing adult film star Stormy Daniels. But the 36-count indictment didn’t identify Whiteside or Gardner, only referring to them as “Individual 1” and “Client 2.” Prosecutors claim Avenatti embezzled money from five of his clients, one of whom was Gardner. Prosecutors also allege that Avenatti embezzled from Geoffrey Ernest Johnson, a mentally ill paraplegic man who won a $4 million settlement but only received $124,000 from his lawyer. He also allegedly embezzled some $4 million from Michelle Phan, a makeup artist who has a huge following on YouTube. Avenatti, who faces a maximum penalty of 382 years in prison, denies any wrongdoing. “No monies were ever embezzled from anyone and I look forward to all of the relevant documents and facts being presented at trial,” Avenatti said in an email to the Los Angeles Times Sunday morning. Avenatti also took to Twitter Sunday to say he looks “forward to ALL of the details coming out regarding Hassan Whiteside’s settlement, the money received by the client, the money deducted for fees and costs, etc. and the reason why he paid the money.” I look forward to ALL of the details coming out regarding Hassan Whiteside’s settlement, the money received by the client, the money deducted for fees and costs, etc. and the reason why he paid the money. I especially look forward to the inquiry by the @NBA and its commissioner. — Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) April 21, 2019 Support our journalism

He would have personally advised against it, mind you, but that doesn’t mean it’s wrong . Giuliani uttered the words while answering a question from CNN’s Jake Tapper regarding Sen. Mitt Romney’s statement in which he says he was “appalled” that “ fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia .” Giuliani quickly fired back and accused Romney of being a hypocrite . “Stop the bull,” Giuliani said. “Stop this pious act.” The former mayor said Romney was “trying to dig up dirt on people, putting dirt out on people” when he was running for president. When Tapper pushed back to say there was a difference between opposition research and accepting information from a foreign adversary, Giuliani suggests it’s all the same. “What a hypocrite. Any candidate in the whole world—in America—would take information,” Giuliani said. “Who says it’s even illegal?” He then insisted that “there’s nothing wrong with taking information from Russians” and says it all “depends on where it came from.” “There’s nothing wrong with taking information from Russians,” Rudy Giuliani tells @jaketapper . #CNNSOTU https://t.co/Fe78m3aDWq pic.twitter.com/wfcU38vTWX — State of the Union (@CNNSotu) April 21, 2019 Despite the insistence on the legality of the move, Giuliani said he “probably wouldn’t” have taken information from a Russian source. “I wasn’t asked,” he said. “I would have advised, just out of excess of caution, don’t do it.” Appearing on NBC’s Meet the Press , Giuliani also refused to give a clear cut answer on whether it was acceptable for a political campaign to use material stolen by foreign adversaries. “It depends on the stolen material,” he said . Giuliani also suggested that the hacking of Democratic emails may have been good for voters. “They shouldn’t have stolen it, but the American people were just given more information about how deceptive, how manipulative her campaign was,” Giuliani said . “I wonder if there isn’t an argument that the people had a right to know that about Hillary Clinton.” Is it okay for political campaigns to use stolen information from foreign adversaries? @RudyGiuliani : ""Depends on the stolen material."" #MTP pic.twitter.com/s9QvAWGZoE — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) April 21, 2019 Support our journalism

Exit polls gave Volodymyr Zelensky more than 70 percent of the vote, leading incumbent Petro Poroshenko to concede defeat . The victory for Zelensky, 41, means a man with no political experience now leads a country that is at the center of the West’s standoff with Russia regarding the annexation of Crimea. Speaking at his campaign headquarters in Kiev, Zelensky apperead to suggest other former Soviet states could follow Ukraine’s example to change politics as usual . “As long as I am not officially a president, I can say as a citizen of Ukraine to all countries of the post-Soviet Union: Look at us—anything is possible,” he said. The election of Zelensky is seen as a rebuke not just of Poroshenko but also of the country’s entire political establishment. It also appeared to send a message that Ukrainians care more about their internal problems than any threat from Russia. But Zelensky has said his top priority would be to secure the release of around 170 members of Ukraine’s military who are being held in the east or in Russia. Beyond a promise to end the war in the eastern Donbass region and fight against corruption, Zelensky has been vague about his plans. “Since there is complete uncertainty about the economic policy of the person who will become president, we simply don’t know what is going to happen and that worries the financial community,” Serhiy Fursa, an investment banker at Dragon Capital in Kiev, tells Reuters . Before the election, Zelensky was best known for his role in the long-running show Servant of the People in which he plays a teacher who unexpectedly wins a presidential election after students post one of his angry rants about corruption online and it goes viral. Throughout the campaign he used his on-screen character to his advantage as he spoke broadly about combating corruption without offering many specifics about how he would run his government. “This feels like a massive protest vote,” writes BBC’s Jonah Fisher . Supporters acknowledged that while they may not believe all of Zelensky’s promises, at least he represents change. “I have grown up under the old politicians and only have seen empty promises, lies and corruption,” a 22-year-old who voted for Zelensky told the Associated Press . “It’s time to change that.” Support our journalism

This has probably always been true, but it was definitely true by April of 1922, when Life Magazine took aim at its competitors in an article headlined “Contents of the Easter Issue of Any Humorous Magazine.” The byline is “D.P.,” but if this is not by Dorothy Parker, it’s by someone even unluckier than George S. Kaufman : Although the same issue of Life includes Parker’s poem “ To Myrtilla, on Easter Day ,” credited to her full name, her 1926 poetry collection Enough Rope includes enough poems originally attributed to “D.P.” in Life Magazine that if there were another D.P., he or she would probably have complained. The piece is a Jazz Age version of “women be shopping”—including taking a shot at “women be shopping” as a premise, nearly 75 years before The Nutty Professor —and it’s cutting, apt, and hilarious. Although some of the precise strains of humor targeted here have gone the way of Prohibition, their descendants are easily recognizable today. Jokes about hipsters bear the distinct features of 1922’s jokes about Avenue A flappers, jokes about women being frivolous are very much still around, and the only reason we don’t run sentimental cartoons about the spirit of peace anymore is that we’ve been at war for 18 years running. But there’s something very reassuring about the idea that, although you can pretty quickly locate terrible comedy from any culture in any era—it’s often what survives—looking a little closer often reveals contemporaneous critics blowing a well-deserved raspberry. –Matthew Dessem Contents of the Easter Issue of Any Humorous Magazine One illustrated joke based on the theory that women attend church on Easter morning less to derive benefit from the service than to display their new hats to the congregation. Three illustrated jokes, variations of the above theme. One cartoon showing the world wearing an Easter bonnet. Two illustrated jokes showing the harrowing effect on Father of the bills for his wife’s and daughter’s Easter finery. Five jokes, without illustrations, along the above lines. One poem about the way Grandma used to look in her Easter hat, supposedly written by Grandpa. One poem comparing the cost of Grandma’s Easter hat with the price of those to-day, intimating that times have changed, and not for the better, since Grandma was a girl. Three illustrated jokes dealing with the Easter costumes of Avenue A flappers. The joke, in each instance, begins with the words “Hully gee!” supposedly uttered by one of the flappers. One drawing of the devil gleefully returning to business at the conclusion of Lent. One drawing of Spring emerging from a large Easter egg. One drawing entitled “Little Willie’s Dream After Dinner,” showing Willie cowering in bed, while a gigantic Easter bunny sits on the footboard. Poem to Phyllis, congratulating her on the becomingness of her Easter hat. Poem to Phillida, implying that the writer’s heart will be found entangled in the trimmings of her Easter hat. Poem to Amaryllis, stating that the author’s affections are held fast by the ribbons that tie her Easter hat. Poem to Chloe, hinting that though her manner is demure and her eyes innocently cast down, she is not unaware of the devastating effect on the local swains of her Easter hat. Cartoon of the spirit of peace soaring over a deserted battlefield, entitled, “Easter, 1922.”"
