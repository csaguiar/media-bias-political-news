Tim Ryan at First Campaign Rally: The Flyover States Are Taking Back the White House,tennesseestar.com,Anthony Gockowski,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/tim-ryan-at-first-campaign-rally-the-flyover-states-are-taking-back-the-white-house/ ,"Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH-13) hosted his first campaign rally in Youngstown, Ohio Saturday after officially declaring candidacy for president earlier this week.
Ryan made the announcement during an appearance on The View Thursday, but returned to his home district Saturday for his first official campaign rally
“First, thank my family for allowing me to do this. I’m Tim Ryan and I’m running for President of the United States of America,” Ryan said to cheers from the crowd gathered outside.
“We stand here today on April 6 2019 a divided country, as you know. And we’ve been divided for a long time, and that division has prevented us from being able to be the best that we can possibly be,” Ryan said, and continued to emphasize throughout his speech that he wants to work on bringing the country back together.
“Things go up and things go down, but if we’re not united we are not going to be able to fix these structural problems that we have in the United States, and I’m running for president first and foremost to try to bring this country back together, because a divided country is a weak country. We have politicians and leaders in America today that want to divide us, they want to put us in one box or the other,” Ryan said.
He went on to say he’s “tired of having to choose” between sides.
“I want us to come together as a country. I want us to seize the future of this country. We are a great country. We can do it if we come together,” he said.
Ryan told his supporters that “the competition we are in today is fierce.”
“We don’t need a superstar and we don’t need a savior. We need to come together, and we need grit and determination,” he said, claiming that the “problem today is so many people work hard and play by the rules and just still can’t get ahead.”
Ryan made several sports references throughout his address, at one point quoting Jimmy Valvano, the legendary coach and broadcaster, and even tossed footballs into the crowd after his speech.
“I’m half Italian so this is my guy, right? So I’m watching Jimmy V and he’s up there and he’s giving a speech. And he said something that I’ll never forget. He said, ‘God must have loved ordinary people because he made so many of us.’ But he said, ‘everyday, in so many different ways, ordinary people do extraordinary things.’”
“I will tell you that if there is one value that I will bring to the highest office in the land, when I wake up, it’s going to be how today can I use every ounce of power that this office has to help ordinary people do something extraordinary today in America. That’s my pledge to you,” Ryan said.
He told the crowd that’s he spent his entire congressional career “trying to make sure that communities like ours aren’t forgotten.”
“The flyover states are my states. The flyover states are your states, and the flyover states are going to start governing the United States of America again,” he said to applause.
At one point, Ryan brought up Russia’s attempt to interfere in the 2016 Election.
“Our enemies come into our social media and they intentionally try to divide us. If there is an incident in America that’s controversial—about kneeling for the national anthem, or there’s a school shooting, or there’s an incident between a cop and a kid—you know who comes on to our social media? The Russians—they come into our social media and they spin things to get us into divided camps so that we’re fighting with each other,” Ryan said.
“Maybe, just maybe, the person that can help heal these wounds is a working-class kid, from a working-class family, from a working-class community, who will go work his rear end off for the American people,” Ryan said later in his speech.
During one candid moment, after getting a positive reaction from the crowd, Ryan admitted that he was “a little nervous about this,” but is “pretty excited now.”
He concluded his speech by telling a story about Muhammad Ali, who said after one fight that he’s “never been knocked down,” but is “either up or getting up.”
“The Mahoning Valley is either up or we’re getting up. Northeast Ohio is either up or we’re getting up. Ohio is either up or we’re getting up, and the United States of America, we’re either up or we’re getting up,” Ryan exclaimed. “Let’s go take back the White House.”

Ohio Republican Joins Cannibus Caucus in Pushing for Greater Marijuana Protection from Federal Government,tennesseestar.com,Andrew Shirley,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/ohio-rep-joins-cannibus-caucus-in-pushing-for-greater-marijuana-protection-from-federal-government-citing-states-rights/ ,"Ohio Republican Rep. Dave Joyce (R-OH-14), along with the entire Congressional Cannabis Caucus, introduced a bill Wednesday that seeks to protect state marijuana policies by strengthening states’ rights.
The Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act, the “STATES Act” for short, would function to amend existing laws, specifically the Controlled Substances Act. It would, essentially, give states that have set their own policies on marijuana regulation the right to have those laws take precedence over the existing federal laws.
Even as various forms of marijuana use become legal across the country, it remains illegal at the federal level. As previously reported :
The 2018 Farm Bill, passed with bipartisan support, legalized the production of industrial hemp. This is the primary source of CBD Oil. Hemp producers immediately jumped into producing the substance. Though products containing THC cannot cross state lines, THC products derived from hemp face no similar restriction. Supporting the bill, the Drug Enforcement Agency DEA removed CBD as a Schedule 1 narcotic. As a result, it is no longer considered among the most dangerous of drug products. While CBD seemed poised for national expansion, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) still has the authority to regulate the sale of CBD and have aggressively stepped up efforts to clamp down on its sale. In late 2016, the situation became so confusing that the Ohio Department of Health had to release a statement clarifying the illegal status CBD oil.
This law would simplify the process by permitting states the ability to disregard many of the federal laws, as long as they have passed their own set of regulations. This bill also carries a few caveats.
The bill would affirm that certain regulations remain in place. No state, for instance, would be permitted to distribute marijuana to individuals under the age of 21. People under the age of 18 will not be permitted to work in any aspect of the marijuana industry. Marijuana would remain illegal in certain areas where marijuana use is a serious safety concern.
One of the most notable aspects of the bill would be a major relief to every marijuana dispensary in the country. Because marijuana is still illegal, many banks will not process or service accounts affiliated with the creation or distribution of marijuana. If they do, the federal government could potentially charge them with drug trafficking or money laundering. This law would ensure that banks servicing accounts for legal marijuana businesses will be protected from prosecution.
The bill’s co-sponsors include a bipartisan list of legislators, including U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Cory Gardner (R-CO). In a statement from the Cannabis Caucus, U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR-03) stated:
Our outdated laws have ruined lives, devastated communities, and wasted resources for critical medical treatment and research. The STATES Act is the next logical step in a comprehensive blueprint for more rational federal cannabis policy. It’s time for Congress to catch up with the rest of America and fix a badly broken system.”
H.R. 2071 , formally introduced Wednesday, has not been acted on yet, but should be referred to committee sometime in the coming week.

Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown Joins Bipartisan Group Introducing Bill Sanctioning China for Opioid Trafficking,tennesseestar.com,Andrew Shirley,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/ohio-senator-sherrod-brown-joins-bipartisan-group-introducing-bill-sanctioning-china-for-opioid-trafficking/ ,"Democratic Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown joined a bipartisan group of six Senators Thursday to introduce a bill that would sanction any country involved in the trafficking of illegal opioids into the United States.
According to the U.S Department of Justice and Drug Enforcement Administration’s 2018 National Drug Assessment , synthetic opioids, specifically fentanyl, secretly created and trafficked into the United States is “responsible for the ongoing fentanyl epidemic.” The majority of these opioids are produced in China and then trafficked into America through Mexico, making these two countries primarily responsible for the current US epidemic. They noted these drugs are “now the most lethal category of opioids used in the United States…Fentanyl suppliers will continue to experiment with new fentanyl-related substances and adjust supplies in attempts to circumvent new regulations imposed by the United States, China, and Mexico.” Because of this, the highest quality of fentanyl carries the street name: “China White.”
S.1044. “A bill to impose sanctions with respect to foreign traffickers of illicit opioids, and for other purposes” intent, per the summary message provided by the bill’s sponsors:
This targeted sanctions legislation would give U.S. law enforcement and sanctions officials more tools to combat the trafficking of opioids into the United States. The legislation would direct the President to publicly identify foreign traffickers of opioids on an annual basis and use a number of precision economic and financial sanctions policy tools to cripple their operations, including denying access to U.S. markets, freezing their assets and blocking transactions with U.S. financial institutions.
Cosponsoring the bill, alongside Senator Brown is; Senator Tom Cotton [R-AR], Senator Marco Rubio [R-FL], Senator Robert Menendez [D-NJ], Senator Jeanne Shaheen [D-NH], Senator Pat Toomey [R-PA].
As previously reported, fentanyl is now a national epidemic. Ohio is one of the states most affected by the deadly drug, despite some of the most comprehensive drug preventative measures in the country. Since 2010, synthetic opioids deaths in Ohio rose from 175 to 2,296.
While both major political parties in the country are aggressively divided, the opioid epidemic is one issue where they have consistently found common ground. President Donald Trump made opioids a keystone issue throughout his entire 2016 campaign for the White House. The bill is expected to move swiftly through the legislative process. The bill also dovetails specifically into another key issue that has defined much of the national political discourse.
President Trump has been a consistent critic of trade imbalances with China and Mexico. While former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was less assertive about the issue, her primary challenger, Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders was also aggressively in favor of addressing trade with China and Mexico. Should this law be enacted, it could become a key point of leverage in potential trade talks that would have bipartisan support.
