The same federal judge made jokes about whether a hispanic defendant's sister was very attractive, this in a case where an Army soldier was charged with paying off a fellow soldier to marry his sister so she could gain U.S. citizenship, The defendant soldier was allowed to plead guilty to a lesser charge because it became clear that the judge was unlikely to find the soldier guilty.of conspiracy to contract a false marriage for immigration purposes."

US Expands ‘Catch and Release’ Amid Surge in Migrants,inhomelandsecurity.com,In Homeland Security Staff,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://inhomelandsecurity.com/us-expands-catch-and-release-amid-surge-in-migrants/,"In Homeland Security Staff
EL PASO, Texas (AP) — The surge of migrant families arriving at the southern border has led the Trump administration to dramatically expand a practice President Donald Trump has long mocked as “catch and release.”
With immigrant processing and holding centers overwhelmed, the administration is busing people hundreds of miles inland and releasing them at Greyhound stations and churches in cities like Albuquerque, San Antonio and Phoenix because towns close to the border already have more than they can handle.
Relief organizations in some cities are struggling to feed and house the migrants and warning that a public health crisis is taking shape, especially with sick infants and children among the many immigrant families who need medical attention.
“We’re asking volunteer doctors and nurses and community members to step up and do what the government should be doing. If this was a hurricane, FEMA would be on the ground helping,” said Jim Gannon, CEO and executive director of Catholic Charities in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
For many years, families arriving at the border were typically released from U.S. custody immediately and allowed to settle in this country with family or friends while their cases wound their way through the courts, a process that often takes years. X
Trump has railed against the practice, tweeting in November that it was over: “Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away.”
But in recent months, the number of families crossing into the U.S. has climbed to record highs, pushing the system to the breaking point. As a result, the government is releasing families faster, in greater numbers and at points farther removed from the border.
Since Dec. 21, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has set free more than 125,000 people who came into the U.S. as families.
Customs and Border Protection is also overloaded, and instead of holding families for up to 72 hours before turning them over to ICE, it has started releasing them directly into the U.S.
“The numbers are overwhelming right now,” said Gregory Archambault, ICE director of enforcement and removal operations in San Diego. “Everybody is stressed. The agency is stressed, the (local governments) are stressed, the law enforcement agencies. Everybody is stressed because there are these mass numbers of people.”
ICE has been releasing asylum-seeking families so quickly that they don’t even have time to make travel arrangements. Families are given court dates, a head of household is often fitted with an ankle monitor, and they are dropped off at a charity-run shelter or bus station.
San Antonio received part of that surge in recent days, forcing the city to open a help center with food for migrants.
In El Paso, where shelters and churches are at capacity and seats on buses headed out of the city are getting harder to find, authorities briefly resorted to holding migrants in a pen lined with concertina wire under the shade of a bridge that connects the American city to Juarez, Mexico. They closed the makeshift holding area over the weekend and moved the migrants to a place with more shelter.
“They treated us like animals,” said Herling Jerlyn, a teenager from Guatemala.
Eduardo De Jesus Bermudez Florez waited for a Greyhound bus Tuesday to take him to Arlington, Texas, after spending time held under the bridge, where he said women cried through the night in cold temperatures.
The immigrant from El Salvador himself teared up as he described his ordeal. He became separated from his wife and their 10-year-old daughter in Mexico before crossing the border, and he still doesn’t know where they are. As De Jesus cried waiting for a bus, his 13-year-old son held the charger for his ankle monitor battery.
“He’d say ‘dad, I want to leave this place,'” said De Jesus, whose wife was once attacked with machetes by gang members. “I just told him that from here we can’t go back. Your future is here. Our country is too violent.”
In Albuquerque, nearly 280 miles from the border, faith-based organizations have helped roughly 1,000 migrants since mid-February. The groups were small at first, but they have been growing and the arrivals have become more frequent.
San Diego County recently opened a shuttered downtown courthouse slated for demolition to house up to 150 asylum seekers. A coalition of religious and civic groups that manages the shelter said it has helped more than 11,000 members of asylum-seeking families since authorities began large-scale releases in late October.
About 22,000 immigrants have been released in Arizona in the past three months. In the Phoenix area, the nonprofit organizations and churches taking them in have a capacity of only 700 a week, said Connie Phillips, president and CEO of Lutheran Social Services in the Southwest.
That means immigration authorities have to drop off families by the busload at places not designed to take them in, like the Greyhound station in Phoenix.
The bus company is no longer allowing anyone without a ticket to wait inside, so immigrant families, including little children, stand outside until a volunteer can get them in touch with a relative to buy them a ticket. That sometimes takes hours.
“The federal government is saying, ‘This is not our responsibility,'” Phillips said. “And the cities and states have not stepped up to provide any kind of emergency funding.”
She added: “This is going to be a public health disaster. These are small children, these are families, these are babies, and we cannot have people just out in the heat.”
Authorities said family arrivals along the U.S.-Mexico border reached an all-time high in February of 45,827 arrests or denials of entry.
“We didn’t have family groups for years and years, like we have now,” ICE’s Archambault said. “Our facilities are not made for this. We have diapers and baby formula and all this stuff, like a nursery.”
In another sign of how U.S. authorities are being tested as rarely before, figures released Tuesday show a significant drop in prosecutions for illegal entry, even as arrests have climbed sharply. The numbers are at odds with Trump’s vow to prosecute everyone who enters the country illegally.
In February, Customs and Border Protection referred 8,998 illegal-entry cases to prosecutors along the border, a drop of 12% from January and 23% from October, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

"U.S. Choosing 'Wrong Place, Time and Opponent to Flex Its Muscle in Taiwan,’ China State Media Warns",www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/china-taiwan-us-taiwan-straits-one-china-south-china-sea-1384593,"A Chinese state-backed newspaper has issued a stern warning to the U.S. over its stance on Taiwan, cautioning Washington that Beijing will not hesitate to act to protect its core interests.
The threat was issued in a Global Times op-ed published Tuesday. On Sunday, two Chinese fighter jets crossed over the “middle line” between China and Taiwan, prompting protests from both Taipei and Washington.
But the Global Times op-ed called such criticism “ridiculous,” accusing the U.S. and Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen of “continuously breaking the status quo in the Taiwan Straits.”
The nation island of Taiwan has long been a diplomatic flashpoint between the U.S. and China. Beijing considers the island—officially called the Republic of China and an independent nation for more than 70 years—part of China, and under its “One-China” policy has retained its commitment to reabsorbing the island, whether through diplomatic or military means.
But U.S. lawmakers have long maintained support for the Taiwanese independence, committing to weapons deals and regional military deployments to protect the island from a Communist Party takeover.
According to the Global Times , “Washington is following a wrong line in the Taiwan Straits. It is playing the Taiwan card because it regards China as a strategic rival. The U.S. has overestimated its military power's deterrence of the mainland as well as Taiwan's wish to always serve as a U.S. pawn. Washington has also underestimated Beijing's resolve and ability to take countermeasures.”
American forces have conducted naval and aerial “freedom of navigation operations” in the Taiwan Straits and in the South China Sea , where Beijing is enforcing contested territorial claims by building a network of island military bases. The operations are designed to keep pressure on Beijing and assert Washington’s belief that the areas constitute international waters. The most recent U.S. deployment to the Straits was on March 24.
Tsai has warned that Chinese military activity in the area has also become more intense . But the Global Times asked, “Why didn't they ever consider that the [People’s Liberation Army] would take countermeasures? It's Washington's blind confidence if it believes Beijing fears to act considering their relations.”
“Although China hopes to maintain stable China-U.S. relations in the long run, it is prepared for fiercer competition in some areas,” it continued. “China will not take the initiative in escalating disputes, but it will fight to protect its core interests, especially on the Taiwan question.”
The article argued that the American military, for all its might and technology, can only “send warships and upgrade its relations” with Taipei. “If the U.S. military returns to Taiwan, China's Anti-secession Law will be violated, and the PLA will launch a direct attack,” it warned.
“Washington is choosing the wrong place, time and opponent to flex its muscle in Taiwan Straits,” the op-ed added.
Weapon sales have formed a key pillar of U.S. support for Taiwan. President Donald Trump’s administration has reportedly agreed to sell at least 60 U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, which according to Bloomberg would be the first advanced warplane sale since 1992.
“Some radical Americans suggest selling more advanced aircraft to Taiwan, which is a dangerous move that breaks the status quo,” the Global Times article read. “The mainland will adopt stiffer countermeasures. Neither should the U.S. overestimate the Taiwan military's loyalty. The advanced military technologies that the U.S. sells to Taiwan will eventually come back to the mainland.
“If the current U.S. government fails to understand the complexity of the Taiwan question and acts aggressively, it is bound to pay the price,” the op-ed concluded.

How Good Are the Cleveland Browns? Stephen A. Smith Warns Hype Is Premature,www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/stephen-smith-cleveland-browns-odell-beckham-jr-kareem-hunt-1384581,"The Cleveland Browns might have made waves during free agency but not everyone seems convinced their offense will live up to their potential.
After winning a combined four games in three seasons, the Browns ended the last campaign with a 7-8-1 record, before adding star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and running back Kareem Hunt to their roster in the offseason.
With eight overall picks in hand—albeit without a first-rounder among them—Cleveland can add further talent to its roster.
Stephen A. Smith, however, warned against getting swept away in the hype currently surrounding the Browns.
Speaking on ESPN’s First Take , Smith refuted co-host Max Kellerman’s assertion that the Browns had “the best offense” in the league after adding Beckham Jr. and Hunt, suggesting it was “amazing” to make such a claim on potential alone.
Smith admitted that “Odell Beckham Jr. is a star and Jarvis Landry can ball” but was less enthusiastic about Baker Mayfield.
The number one overall pick of the 2018 draft impressed in his rookie season, leading the Browns to their first win in 635 days as they broke a 19-game winning run.
In his 13 starts for the Browns, Mayfield threw 27 touchdowns, breaking the passing touchdowns record for a rookie previously held by Peyton Manning and Russell Wilson.
However, Smith suggested Mayfield’s 63.8 percent completion rate was hardly exciting, compared to that of Drew Brees, Andrew Luck and Patrick Mahomes.
“I’ve got Kansas City as a better offense,” he said. “I’ve got the Indianapolis Colts as a better offense [than Cleveland] and I’ve got the New Orleans Saints as a better offense.”
While it is true that the Browns have a lot of ground to make up, they have definitely stolen a march on the rest of the AFC North. The Cincinnati Bengals have not improved their roster, while the Baltimore Ravens have lost key defensive personnel and the Pittsburgh Steelers have waved farewell to Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell.
In Beckham Jr. and Hunt, Cleveland has landed two of stars. The former has passed the 1,000-yard receiving threshold in each of his five seasons in the league except for 2017 when an injury limited him to just four games.
The trade that took the three-time Pro Bowler from the New York Giants to the Browns last month shocked the NFL, but Smith suggested Beckham Jr. would have to prove himself in the postseason.
“Legends are made in the postseason,” he said on the Stephen A. Smith Show . “We don’t rave about Jerry Rice and Terrell Owens for what they did in the regular season. It matters, it counts, but not as much as what you do in the postseason.”
Hunt’s signing attracted more criticism given it came while the former Kansas City Chiefs running back was being investigated by the NFL for assault. While his return to action might be an issue from a PR perspective, Hunt should be a major asset on the field.
Last season, in the 11 games he played before being released by the Chiefs, Hunt rushed for 824 yards and seven touchdowns, adding 26 receiving yards for seven touchdowns.
In his rookie season, he led the NFL with 1,327 yards and eight touchdowns.

"Abolishing Electoral College Would Incentivize Illegal Immigrants to Vote Democrat, Newt Gingrich Claims",www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/newt-gingrich-abolish-electoral-college-fox-friends-steal-election-democrats-1384609,"Former Republican House Speaker and Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich claimed Democrats would absolutely try to ""steal the election"" and have illegal immigrants vote should the U.S. dismantle the Electoral College.
Speaking on Fox & Friends Wednesday morning, Gingrich mocked the Democratic-led Senate proposal to abolish the Electoral College system ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Gingrich said the move would lead to election chaos and compared it to the Palm Beach County ballot debacle during the 2000 election. He lamented a frequently cited argument that the most populous states of New York and California would have too much sway in the presidential elections.
Gingrich said the Senate Democrats behind the Electoral College dismantling proposal -- Sens. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Dianne Feinstein of California -- are in favor of the idea because they want illegal immigrants to vote.
""I think if you want to set up a single nationwide count so we could have the Palm Beach story nationwide, and you could have the maximum incentive for Democrats to steal the election,"" the former GOP House Speaker in the 1990s told Fox & Friends. ""And the maximum incentive for Democrats to have illegal immigrants voting, it's a terrific idea. And I think anybody who believes in having a totally corrupt nationwide system ought to be in favor of it.""
""But if you think it's better to have a decentralized system, Gingrich continued. ""And by the way, I want to see these candidates for president go to Iowa and go to New Hampshire and explain why they think in the future no presidential candidate should worry about any place except New York and California.""
Former GOP House Speaker and Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich claimed Democrats would absolutely try to ""steal the election"" and have illegal immigrants vote should the U.S. dismantle the Electoral College. Screenshot: Fox & Friends | YouTube The move by Senate Democrats to propose abolishing the Electoral College system serves as companion legislation to a bill pushed by Tennessee Democratic. Rep. Steve Cohen in the House. Wide swaths of Democratic voters are motivated to eliminate the Electoral College after two elections -- 2000 and 2016 -- were lost to Republican presidential candidates who actually had fewer overall votes. Both George W. Bush and Donald Trump won their respective elections against Democratic candidates Al Gore and Hillary Clinton, who actually won the popular vote.
The Electoral College system, which seeks to prevent candidates from campaigning only in the country's largest cities, has been criticized for skewing the demands of the country's true majority. Although conservatives and conspiracy theorists frequently float claims of widespread illegal voting the accusations against Democrats are widely unproven.
“Before the 2000 election, I introduced a bipartisan resolution to amend the Constitution and create a system of direct election for presidents,” Durbin said in a statement. “And I still believe today as I did then that the Electoral College is a relic from a shameful period in our nation’s history, and allows some votes to carry greater weight than others.”
Gillibrand, a 2020 candidate herself, said the Electoral College has ""distorted the outcome of elections and disenfranchised millions of voters."" Another 2020 Democratic hopeful, Beto O'Rourke, has also repeatedly called for the abolishment of the bureaucratic system.
On Fox & Friends Wednesday, Gingrich also addressed Trump's potential shutdown of the southern U.S. border with Mexico, urging the president against it because of it's negative impact on the economy.
“I think that the consequences to the economy, to our relationship with Mexico, to millions of families would be absurd,"" Gingrich said. ""I would strongly urge the president not to try to shut down the border. We have so many people every day who go back and forth. We have so much economic goods on both sides. It would truly be a mess and it would frankly mess up the very economy he is proud of. You would have tremendous side effects from closing the border.”

China Will Not Overtake the US Economy Anytime Soon: Here’s Why,inhomelandsecurity.com,Wes O'Donnell,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://inhomelandsecurity.com/china-not-overtake-us-economy/,"Get started on your Homeland Security degree at American Military University.
By Wes O’Donnell Managing Editor, In Military.com
Note: The opinions and comments stated in the following article and views expressed in any article or by any contributor to In Homeland Security, do not represent the views of American Military University, American Public University System, its management or employees.
Over the past several decades, China has boasted exponential economic growth to one day become the manufacturing and exporting hub of the world.
Western economists have watched the past 20 years with dismay as the Chinese economy’s annual GDP growth rate averaged 10%. The common consensus from Wall Street to the Beltway was that at that rate China would soon replace the United States as the world’s largest economy.
Some say Beijing already has. If you use GDP purchasing power parity (PPP), China edges out the U.S. with a GDP of $23.15 trillion to the United States’ $19.39 trillion. But while PPP may help costing, it excludes profits and doesn’t consider the different quality of goods among countries. X
The best number for measurement is Nominal GDP, in which the United States still maintains a lead over the Asian giant: the United States’ $19.39 trillion economy over China’s $12.01 trillion economy. The X Factor: Age
It stands to reason then, that it is only a matter of time before China surpasses the United States. However, in their optimistic forecasts of China’s economy, many economists overlook one crucial demographic variable that changes the entire equation: China has an aging population problem.
China’s median age is forecast to increase to 56 in 2050, while the U.S. will have a median age of 44. Historically , the younger an economy’s population structure, the stronger its vitality for economic innovation. As the median age rises in China and the proportion of the population age 65 and over increases, the economic growth rate could plummet.
In fact, China’s GDP growth slowed from 9.5% in 2011 to 6.6% in 2018. Certainly, some of the slowdown can be attributed to the ongoing trade war with the U.S., which hurts confidence and makes it less likely that consumers will spend. Again, one of the most important factors is China’s aging population. Japan Has Endured the Same Phenomenon
In Japan, the total fertility rate from 1950 to 2016 was 1.77 births per female compared to 2.33 births in the United States. This led to a faster aging rate in Japan. According to Yi Fuxian , a columnist with Ink Stone, Japan’s GDP growth has been lower than America’s since 1992 (excepting 2010). Japan’s nominal GDP rose from 8% of the U.S. GDP in 1960 to 71% in 1995 and then fell to 24% in 2018.
China is on a similar path. Assuming China can stabilize its population growth rate at 1.2 births per female, China’s population will fall from 1.28 billion in 2019 to 1.08 billion in 2050. On the other hand, the U.S. population is expected to increase from 328 million in 2019 to 370 million in 2050.
Perhaps most important, China’s working-age population of 20 to 64 began to shrink in 2017, while the U.S. working-age population will not peak until 2050. Unlikely for China to Overtake US Economy
Crunching the numbers, China will come close but not overtake the U.S. economy. China’s population is getting too old too fast for its economy to ever meaningfully catch up without massive social reforms in the country.
The biggest question, perhaps, is how will the Chinese economic slowdown affect China’s trading partners around the globe? According to the International Monetary Fund , China has been the biggest single contributor to worldwide economic growth for the past 10 years.
A sharp slowdown instead of a gradual one could have severe economic implications in the West. China still supplies the West with a large percentage of diverse goods including iron, steel, aluminum, textiles, cement, chemicals, toys, electronics, railcars, ships, aircraft and many other products.
An aging Chinese population could also cripple the relatively new Chinese middle class, making economic matters worse. As of 2012, 54% of China’s urban population earned between $9,000 and $16,000 per year. When adjusted for prices, that puts half the population squarely in the middle class.
A nation’s economic power is the truest form of realpolitik and shares just as much prestige as a country’s military or diplomatic might.
In terms of nominal GDP, the United States is still the world’s economic leader and has been so since at least 1916, when U.S. output overtook that of the British Empire. Based on the numbers, the U.S. is unlikely to lose its #1 spot anytime soon."

"Jens Stoltenberg Address to Congress: How to Watch Live Stream, Time, for NATO Secretary General Speech",www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/jens-stoltenberg-address-congress-live-stream-time-1384632,"Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, will address a joint session of Congress at 11 a.m. EDT on Wednesday.
Stoltenberg's speech, marking the first time a NATO chief has ever addressed Congress, can be watched via a live stream on the NATO website and on C-Span .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell invited Stoltenberg to address lawmakers to show that the international alliance continued to enjoy bipartisan support in Washington, despite repeated criticism from President Donald Trump. The speech also commemorates NATO's 70-year anniversary, as it was first founded on April 4, 1949.
Foreign policy analysts commenting on Stoltenberg’s visit and NATO’s history have pointed out that it is one of the most successful alliances, regardless of challenges and recent criticism from the White House.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg gives his speech during the 55th Munich Security Conference on February 15 in Munich, Germany Alexandra Beier/Getty Images “NATO is adapting and allies are spending more on defense. And I think this administration is understanding more and more how critical NATO is to some of the challenges that it faces, including China,” Mark Simakovsky of the Atlantic Council told Voice of America . “So, in many ways, NATO is far from obsolete.”
Trump’s principle criticism of the alliance is his belief that numerous members do not contribute enough to their defense. Partially in response to Trump’s pressure, several NATO members did increase their commitments to NATO, and at a quicker rate than previously planned. NATO’s goal is for each member to contribute 2 percent of its annual budget, but only a few of the alliance’s 28 members meet or surpass that benchmark, with the U.S. contributing the largest amount.
Although the White House has attempted to reassure NATO and the public that the president remains firmly committed to the alliance, Trump previously voiced skepticism and questioned whether the U.S. even needed the organization. A January report in The New York Times raised further concerns , with administration aides telling the news outlet that Trump had repeatedly suggested withdrawing the U.S. from the alliance last year.
In a meeting with Stoltenberg on Tuesday, Trump said that he and the secretary-general had successfully convinced several members to “pay their fair share.” “It's called burden sharing,"" the president said before calling out Germany for failing to set aside adequate funding for the alliance.

Green Day Sparks Controversy With Upcoming Woman’s Guide Penned and Illustrated by Men,www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/green-day-book-controversy-last-american-girls-1384560,"On 4/3/19 at 9:56 AM EDT Share Culture
Green Day shocked fans with the announcement of an upcoming book on Tuesday, one that is now the center of an internet debate due to the book’s subject matter. The forthcoming graphic novel titled Last of the American Girls —an ode to their song of the same name from the 2009 album 21st Century Breakdown —had no women creatives involved in the project.
Last Of The American Girls is said to be “an inspiring homage and handbook for the rebellious everywoman who refuses to capitulate,” according to the band’s publisher, Dey Street Books, in a statement to Rolling Stone .
The book, slated to be released on October 29, is penned by Green Day musicians Billie Joe Armstrong, Tré Cool and Mike Dirnt. In addition to the three men, cartoonist Frank Caruso was enlisted to illustrate the novel. Fans seem to understand the role of the three band members, but questioned why a female illustrator was not asked to be a part of the project, according to conversations on Twitter.
Others questioned the subject matter altogether, wondering why Green Day felt inclined to write a book about women in the first place. Though neither the band nor the publisher have revealed much about the content of the graphic novel, some fans online have assumed it may be a guide to living life as a woman, which they see as inappropriate coming from four men.
Those who are in full support of the band’s latest creative project assume the book will not fall into offensive terrain, and won’t aim to tell any woman how to live. In all, the conversation, which eventually trended on Twitter, centered around a premature disappointment surrounding Green Day’s decision to write a female-oriented book for two reasons. The first, they are men themselves, and the second, they used their first book project to project potential guidelines for a female, rebel lifestyle instead of using the platform for something closer to their level of expertise.
Armstrong formerly revealed the song which inspired the book began as a project about his wife, but evolved. “Then I started getting into more of my own beliefs—anything from a little book of conspiracies to playing vinyl records or something,” he told Blunt. “It’s sort of about an empowering, sort of subterranean kind of lifestyle, but at the same time there’s a new era coming in with the way we all need to live.”"

People think that he will be able to rally his supporters and that all these people will show up for his rallies. But that's not so. Once a viable candidate commits all that candidate has to do is campaign on the inaction of this President in key areas that got him elected. Hold his feet to the fire, make him explain why DACA is still working, why the wall wasn't built with Congress and the Senate for 2 years, why nobody is or will be prosecuted for the Russia hoax/coup attempt, why he said so many things and either caved, reversed, walked back or didn't follow through. Once that happens the President will have to address those issues and explain himself. He'll not be able to explain any of it to his base and his base will shift to the other candidate. His base isn't stupid. He won't be able to explain why he didn't use his constitutional powers. He won't be able to blame Congress from 2017 to 2019.

‘Destiny 2’ Long Goodbye Guide - How to Get the Insight Terminus Sniper,www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/destiny-2-long-goodbye-guide-how-get-insight-terminus-sniper-1384635,"On 4/3/19 at 9:47 AM EDT Share Gaming Destiny 2 Gaming
Destiny 2 ’s latest Curated Roll is the Long Goodbye Legendary Sniper Rifle. In this guide, we’ll tell you how to get it by grinding the Insight Terminus Strike. We’ll also offer a handful of helpful tips to maximize your score at different points in the quest.
How to get the Long Goodbye in Destiny 2
The Long Goodbye is earned as Strike-specific loot in the Insight Terminus Warmind Strike. So, this drop operates just like every other Strike-specific loot in Destiny 2 . Completing the Strike always offers a chance to get the drop you want, but earning a higher score increases the odds. There are specific point thresholds that increase drop percentages.
While those facts are good to know, however, they don’t fully mitigate the frustrations of randomization. Even if you run through the Strike several times with a perfect score, there’s still a chance the Long Goodbye won’t drop. As such, you’ll just have to keep grinding till you get the reward you seek.
Tips to Complete the Insight Terminus Strike
Insight Terminus is a fairly linear strike with obvious objectives, but here are a few tips to help you finish the mission quickly. In this Strike, your main enemies include Vex and Red Legion. With that in mind, any high-damage weapons are recommended. Especially during your encounters with the Kargen boss, you need to do as much damage as possible. Keep some Snipers and Rockets in your loadout. When fighting bosses and mini-bosses along the way, remember to take out the smaller enemies first. Supers and explosives are also very helpful in any boss encounters. When you get to the Vinculum Cell zone, use the surrounding pillars for cover against waves of Cabal. Further along the pursuit phase, Kargen will escape through a large door. It’s your team’s job to grab the two orbs from the center of the arena and put then on both sides of said door. During the boss fight, you need to stand in the circle Kargen spawns to deactivate his shield. You’ll have to repeat this cycle several times while taking down tons of Red Legion. He’ll hop to a pillar when he hits half health, but the process for damage is the same. Stand in the circle he creates to take down the shield.
What is the Long Goodbye?
The Long Goodbye is a beast of Sniper, but its rolls determine how you'll use it. Bungie/Aztecross Gaming @ YouTube
For those unsure about going through the grind to get it, here’s a look at what the Long Goodbye can offer the Guardians who find it. Adaptive Frame : A well-rounded grip, reliable and sturdy. Rapid Hit : Rapid precision hits temporarily increase stability and reload speed.
There are also a series of randomized rolls with varying traits as well. Arrowhead Brake"

"'Inevitable' That Robert Mueller Will Have to Testify in Front of Congress, Schiff Tells MSNBC",www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/adam-schiff-robert-mueller-testify-congress-msnbc-russia-investigation-donald-1384551,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told MSNBC on Wednesday that he believed it was inevitable that special counsel Robert Mueller would have to testify before Congress.
As the battle over the release of the report of Mueller’s 22-month investigation rages on, Schiff said the Democratic Party would want to hear conclusions from the head of the Russia investigation himself.
Mueller’s probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election sought to establish whether President Donald Trump’s campaign had conspired or cooperated with Moscow to defeat Hillary Clinton and claim the White House. The almost two-year investigation produced indictments against 34 individuals and three Russian businesses on charges that ranged from computer hacking to conspiracy to financial crimes.
But the final report—sent to Attorney General William Barr on March 22—has still not been released. Barr issued a four-page summary that he said represented the investigation’s key findings, concluding that neither Trump nor his campaign conspired with Moscow to infludence the 2016 election
Trump celebrated Barr's summary letter as a “total exoneration,” despite the the report specifically stating that its findings did not exonerate the president. The Democrats consider the summary of the 400-page report as insufficient, and lawmakers are now working through House committees to force the attorney general to release the full report with the underlying evidence, and might call key figures to testify.
“I think it’s inevitable Bob Mueller’s going to have to testify before Congress,” Schiff told Morning Joe . “I would think that he will probably be needed before more than one committee. We’ll have an interest in his testimony or others on the issue of the counterintelligence findings. And the Judiciary Committee, maybe the Oversight Committee as well, might have an interest in other aspects of the investigation.”
The House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, gave Barr until April 2 to deliver the Mueller report in full. Barr missed the deadline, having said in a second letter that he would have a redacted version of the report ready by mid-April. The committee is now preparing subpoenas to force the release of the full report and testimony relating to the investigation.
“In the intel committee, we have a statutory requirement that the intelligence community, FBI, brief us on any significant counterintelligence or intelligence activity. And it’s hard to imagine something that rises more to that level than this investigation,"" Schiff said.
Schiff, a California representative and prominent critic and favored target of the president, has been accused by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee of creating a “demonstrably false” narrative of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
All nine Republicans on the committee demanded last week that Schiff resign from the chairmanship, arguing that his insistence that ""collusion"" took place was “incompatible with your duties as the chairman of this committee.”
Schiff responded e mphatically , accusing his colleagues of ignoring evidence of questionable and even criminal conduct by the Trump campaign. “I have always said that the question of whether this amounts to conspiracy is another matter,” he told the Republican committee members. “But I do not think that conduct, criminal or not, is OK. And the day we do think that's OK is the day we will look back and say that is the day America lost its way.”

"American Tourist and Guide Kidnapped at Gunpoint on Safari in Uganda, Hostage Takers Demand $500,000",www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/american-kidnapped-uganda-safari-tourism-1384573,"An American tourist was kidnapped by gunmen at a wildlife park in Uganda, local police confirmed.
Kimbley Sue Endecott, 35, and her Ugandan guide Jean Paul went missing when four gunmen ambushed them on Tuesday evening. The American has been named ""Kimbley"" by local police, but ""Kimberley"" by global outlets such as Reuters. Similarly, the guide has also been named as ""Jean-Paul Mirenge Remezo"" by local outlets.
They were driving between the Katoke gate and Wilderness Camp at Queen Elizabeth National Park when kidnappers ambushed and held them at gunpoint.
Two other tourists, Martin Julius and his wife, Barbel, were rescued after they contacted the camp manager. The pair were left behind by the gunmen, according to a joint statement from the Uganda Tourism Board and the Uganda Wildlife Authority.
The suspected kidnappers used one of the victims’ phones to demand $500,000. Police are treating the demand as a ransom.
Police are hunting for four men in connection with the incident. Officials said they had closed all exits between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which borders the park.
“All security agencies such as the Uganda Police and the Uganda People’s Defense Forces including wardens from the Uganda Wildlife Authority have joined in the hunt for these outlaws with the main aim of safely securing the hostages,"" read the statement from the tourist board and wildlife authority. ""The lives of the kidnapped are a key priority during this process. We appeal for calm as we find a lasting solution to this issue.”
""We strongly believe the perpetrators and victims could still be trapped within our search area, and we are hopeful that our efforts will lead to their successful recovery,” Polly Namaye, deputy spokesperson with the Uganda Police Force, said in a statement. “We want to further reassure the public that this is the first...incident of this kind registered in such a very peaceful setting, and those planning to visit the National Park and its surroundings should not be discouraged.”
The U.S. Embassy in Kampala has been alerted, police said. The embassy did not immediately respond to Newsweek 's request for comment.
Queen Elizabeth National Park is the country's most popular tourist destination. Founded as Kazinga National Park, it was renamed after a visit from Queen Elizabeth II, the Uganda Wildlife Authority reports. Spanning more than 750 square miles, it is home to some 95 species of mammal and more than 600 species of bird.
The U.S. government advised Americans to ""exercise increased caution"" when visiting Uganda, in a travel advisory issued in December. ""Violent crime, such as armed robbery, home invasion, and sexual assault, is common, especially in larger cities including Kampala and Entebbe. Local police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious crime,"" the advisory stated.

The reason is because it is a hard argument to say we oppose an ordered asylum process.
The problem is Trump. In terms of building his wall/fence/barrier what he would have to agree to is simply what will happen if he doesn't. The problem is the political price.
The price is this and more. Terminate the emergency declaration (10 USC 2808) and stop the transfer using section 1001 to 10 USC 284 process.. That's technical. Here's the issue.
Every year there has to be a DoD authorization law. The current year ends September 30. As part of the new law, the Democrats can simply forbid those DoD funds from being used at the border. That includes any funds under the declaration (I think that is zero in any case, for reasons I've explained elsewhere) and the section 1001 transfer money.
That's what happens all the time -- the new law supersedes the old law and can change whatever the old law allowed.
All Trump can do is refuse to sign the law, shutting down the DoD. In my opinion, Trump would get hammered if he shut down the DoD because Democrats required that funding for the wall/fence/barrier not be done by using funds from the DoD, but be funded directly and transparently through the DHS budget."

Spectacular 'Mirror Pools' and Large 'Living Rocks' Discovered During Deep-sea Expedition in Gulf of California,www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/mirror-pools-living-rocks-deep-sea-expedition-gulf-california-1384529,"A deep-sea expedition to a “magnificent” underwater ecosystem in the Gulf of California has discovered towering mineral structures up to 75 feet high and 33 feet across which feature spectacular reflective “mirror pools.”
The towers are located around 6,500 feet below the surface in an area filled with hydrothermal vents (cracks or fissures in the seafloor found in volcanically active regions that spew out heated fluids) and cold seeps (cracks or fissures where hydrocarbon-rich fluid seeps up from below the seafloor.)
With the help of a remotely-operated submersible equipped with 4K underwater cameras, the team aboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s research vessel R/V Falkor spotted areas where superheated fluids from the vents—which can reach temperatures of up to around 700 degrees Fahrenheit—collected underneath flat structures on the towers, creating the otherworldly illusion of an upside-down mirror.
According to Mandy Joye from the University of Georgia, who led the expedition, the towers are biological hotspots for life and could potentially contain previously undiscovered species, despite the fact that the hydrothermal fluids contained high levels of sulfide, which can be harmful to living organisms.
“We discovered remarkable towers where every surface was occupied by some type of life,” Joye said in a statement. “The vibrant colors found on the ‘living rocks’ was striking, and reflects a diversity in biological composition as well as mineral distributions. This is an amazing natural laboratory to document incredible organisms and better understand how they survive in extremely challenging environments.”
Joye described the hydrothermal ecosystem as “one of the most magnificent things” she had ever seen in the natural world. However, the impact of humanity on this deep-sea landscape was clear for all to see.
“Unfortunately, even in these remote and beautiful environments we saw copious amounts of trash including fishing nets, deflated Mylar balloons, and even a discarded Christmas tree,” Joye said. “This provided a stark juxtaposition next to the spectacular mineral structures and biodiversity.”
Nevertheless, during the latest expedition, the researchers were able to study hydrothermal and gas plumes in fine detail using a host of advanced technology, including radiation-tracking devices and fluid samplers, as well as the 4K camera.
The scientists hope that the data they collected will help them to better understand the methane cycle in the deep-sea environment. Methane—which the team detected high concentrations of in the hydrothermal fluids and gas samples—is a gas which has a greenhouse effect that is 30 times stronger than carbon dioxide.
“It is a different world down there,” Schmidt Ocean Institute Cofounder, Wendy Schmidt, said in a statement. “Each dive feels like floating into a science fiction film. The complex layers of data we’ve collected aboard Falkor during this expedition will help tell the story of this remote place and bring it to public attention.
“Witnessing these remarkable oceanscapes, we are reminded that although they are out of our everyday sight, they are hardly immune from human impact,” she said. “Our hope is to inspire people to learn more and care more about our ocean.”

Brunei Laws Punishing Gay Sex With Death Come Into Force As Celebrities Urge Boycott of Legendary U.S. Hotels Owned by Sultan,www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/brunei-laws-punishing-gay-sex-death-come-force-celebrities-urge-boycott-1384520,"The internationally condemned laws punishing gay sex and adultery with stoning to death come into force Wednesday in the small Southeast Asian kingdom of Brunei.
The new penalty for sex between men and adultery will be enforced across the oil-rich nation, where homosexuality was already illegal. Lesbian sex is punishable by up to 10 years in jail and 40 lashes, according to the BBC. The draconian punishments have sparked international outcry and a celebrity-led boycott.
Brunei, where two-thirds of the population of about 430,000 are Muslims, instituted the Islamic laws in 2014. The laws caused international uproar, boycotts and calls for divestment, and the nation delayed rolling out the punishments. But the country's attorney general announced at the close of 2018 that the statutes allowing extreme penalties would be enforced starting April 3, in accordance with a strict interpretation of Islamic law.
“Brunei must immediately halt its plans to implement these vicious punishments and revise its penal code in compliance with its human rights obligations. The international community must urgently condemn Brunei’s move to put these cruel penalties into practice,” Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Amnesty International’s Brunei researcher, said in a statement to Newsweek before the laws came into effect.
Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah delivers a speech during an event in Bandar Seri Begawan on April 3. Brunei's sultan called for ""stronger"" Islamic teachings in the country, as tough new laws, including death by stoning for gay sex and adultery, were due to come into force. AFP/Getty Images Sex between two men or an unmarried heterosexual couple is punishable either by death by stoning or by 100 lashes, the Australian broadcaster ABC reported. To be punished under the law, the parties involved must either confess to the so-called crimes or be condemned by four witnesses. A punishment of imprisonment for seven years or a flogging of 10 lashes is reserved for individuals convicted of sodomy or adultery by other evidence.
Brunei’s new Islamic-inspired laws also mandate corporal punishment for robbery and drinking alcohol. Women who give birth out of wedlock or have abortions also face jail time.
The United Nations derided the laws on Monday. “I appeal to the government to stop the entry into force of this draconian new penal code, which would mark a serious setback for human rights protections for the people of Brunei if implemented,” the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, said in a statement.
Celebrities including George Clooney and Elton John have called for a boycott of the Dorchester Collection of luxury hotels owned by the Brunei’s sovereign wealth fund and inextricably linked to the billionaire Sultan of Brunei following the announcement of the brutal anti-gay laws.
Despite the condemnation, Brunei’s leaders have remained obdurate. ""Brunei Darussalam is a sovereign Islamic and fully independent country and, like all other independent countries, enforces its own rule of law,"" Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, who also acts as the country’s prime minister, said in a recent statement.

About time: POTUS Trump finally uses the word “TREASON” to describe the Deep State coup attempt against him,thenationalsentinel.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thenationalsentinel.com/2019/04/03/about-time-potus-trump-finally-uses-the-word-treason-to-describe-the-deep-state-coup-attempt-against-him/,"April 4, 2019 in Constitution // Study: Weapon magazine bans do NOTHING to decrease fatal shootings, proving Democrats really DO just want to disarm us About time: POTUS Trump finally uses the word “TREASON” to describe the Deep State coup attempt against him Tweet
By J. D. Heyes
Once it became crystal clear that the Deep State operatives loyal to Barack Obama and to the preservation of the Washington political establishment had conspired against POTUS Donald Trump in an unprecedented attempt to remove him from office, we began using the “T” word to describe their behavior .
“T” as in treason . What else do you call it when members of your own government secretly plot to overthrow you?
But up to now, only this publication and precious few others dared to use the T-word to describe the actions of James Comey, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Andrew McCabe, Bruce Ohr, Loretta Lynch, James Clapper, John Brennan, and even President Obama himself in launching “Spygate.” Who knew? This transition of power came with strings attached.
That has changed. POTUS Trump himself has now used the word in an interview with reporters at the White House on Tuesday.
During a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, the president was asked what he thought about the recently-released report from special counsel Robert Mueller , who cleared him of “Russian collusion” allegations (because it was always a hoax devised by Obama, Comey, et. al).
As The Gateway Pundit reported, POTUS addressed the issue for about six minutes, hitting, especially, Democrats who remain in denial after Mueller’s findings, continuing to insist — at risk to our country’s political stability — that the president did ‘collude.’
At the end of his remarks, the president declared, “People did things that were very, very bad for our country and very, very illegal. And you can even say treasonous .”
Trump also lashed out at Democrats who are now demanding that, after two years of this witch hunt, the entire Mueller report should be released in full , unredacted — which violates the law and current Justice Department policies especially because doing so could expose untold numbers of people to embarrassing invasions of their privacy. Trump has now used the word so its time for prosecutions
“It’s a disgrace,” the president said, adding that he has “total respect” for Attorney General William Barr, who must now decide what portions of the report to release and in what form.
“Anything we give [Democrats] will never be enough,” POTUS continued. “It’s a 400-page report, right? We could give them 800 pages and it wouldn’t be enough.”
Trump noted that the Spygate “plot” has actually gone on longer than two years, adding that it’s been percolating in various forces since he “came down the escalator” at Trump Tower in New York City in June 2015 to announce his candidacy. He also mentioned the “insurance policy” discussed by Page, Strzok, and McCabe, which testimony has indicated was the plot to oust Trump in case he beat Hillary Clinton.
Remember that? Fox News reporter Bret Baier tweeted the following: “Text-from Peter Strzok to Lisa Page (Andy is Andrew McCabe): “I want to believe the path u threw out 4 consideration in Andy’s office-that there’s no way he gets elected-but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk.It’s like an insurance policy in unlikely event u die be4 you’re 40.” Text-from Peter Strzok to Lisa Page (Andy is Andrew McCabe): ""I want to believe the path u threw out 4 consideration in Andy's office-that there's no way he gets elected-but I'm afraid we can't take that risk.It's like an insurance policy in unlikely event u die be4 you're 40""
— Bret Baier (@BretBaier) December 13, 2017
During Trump’s interview a reporter, off-camera, actually brought up a good point: He noted that back in the 1990s, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who is now chairman of the House Oversight Committee, was opposed to the unredacted release of then-independent Counsel Kenneth Starr’s report on the various scandals involving Bill and Hillary Clinton — but now he says the full Mueller report should be released.
Trump then noted that Nadler, House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and other Democrats were “disappointed” by the Mueller report, but he added:
I guarantee you they go into a room, between Nadler, Schiff and the group, and they laugh like hell at how they kept this thing going for two years. They laugh like hell. And I hope that this investigation now, which is finished…I hope they now go and take a look at the origins [of the Mueller probe]…where it started, how it started, who started it…whether it’s McCabe or Comey or a lot of them…how high up in the White House did it go…
Now that the president has used the T-word to describe the Deep State coup attempt against him, it’s time for AG Barr to prosecute them all for what they tried to do. America can’t be turned into a banana republic with stealth bombers and nuclear weapons.

Who Is Assata Shakur? Backlash After Conference With 2020 Dems Starts With Words of Activist And Convicted Killer,www.newsweek.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/assata-shakur-black-power-activism-2020-elections-democrats-1384510,"On 4/3/19 at 8:39 AM EDT Share
An National Association for the Advancement of Colored People speaker sparked a backlash Monday when he opened a conference in Washington, D.C. with the words of activist and fugitive Assata Shakur , who was convicted of killing a New Jersey police officer in 1977.
Calling Shakur a ""leader,"" NAACP vice president of civic engagement Jamal Watkins led the audience of 2019's We the People summit in a chant of:
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.It is our duty to win.We must love each other and support each other.We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
2020 Democratic candidates including Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, Beto O’Rourke and Bernie Sanders took part in the conference, but were not on stage during the chant. Booker, who is a New Jersey senator, did not immediately respond to Newsweek ’s request for comment.
New Jersey officials condemned Watkins’ choice of words Tuesday on social media. State police Colonel Patrick Callahan wrote on Facebook: “It is an affront to every man and woman who wears the badge that someone would choose to evoke the words of a convicted cop killer and fugitive from justice at a political conference.”
New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal wrote on Twitter: ""There are many inspirational leaders. Assata Shakur is not one of them. To invoke her words is to dishonor the @NJSP State Trooper she was convicted of murdering.""
Born JoAnne Deborah Byron in Flushing, Queens, on July 16, 1947, Shakur grew up in New York City and Wilmington, North Carolina. She joined the Black Panther Party after graduating from college in New York, before becoming a member of the Black Liberation Army (BLA)—an underground militant activist group.
Shakur was involved in a 1973 shootout that killed State Trooper Werner Foerster and fellow BLA member Zayd Malik Shakur. Assata Shakur, BLA member Sundiata Acoli and state trooper James Harpur survived the incident on the New Jersey Turnpike.
Acoli, also known as Clark Edward Squire, was sentenced to life in prison in 1974 for Foerster’s murder. Initially acquitted on several charges, Shakur, also known as Joanne Chesimard, was also convicted in New Jersey in 1977.
She escaped from prison in 1979 and fled to Cuba in 1984. Surveilled by the FBI during her time with the BLA, she is currently on the agency’s ""Most Wanted"" list under the name Joanne Deborah Chesimard.
Shakur, who spent time in and out of correctional facilities from the time of the shootings until her eventual escape, is considered a political prisoner by some activists. In a foreward to Assata: An Autobiography , activist and author Angela Davis called her a ""compassionate human being with an unswerving commitment to justice.""
Per The Guardian , Davis has said Shakur’s story exemplifies the police brutality black activists faced in the 1970s. “Forty years seems as if it were a long time ago; however, at the beginning of the 21st century, we're still dealing with the very same issues—police violence, healthcare, education, people in prison and so forth,” she said.
The NAACP did not immediately respond to Newsweek 's request for comment.

Stop using Democrat arguments - designed to undermine TRUMP.
