Sierra Leone is forcing its citizens into isolation to fight Ebola,www.vox.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/2014/9/25/6845549/sierra-leone-is-forcing-its-citizens-into-isolation-to-fight-ebola-virus-quarantine,"Flipboard
In a new Vox video (above) aid worker Ishmeal Alfred Charles describes the realities of life in Freetown, Sierra Leone, a city currently losing its battle against Ebola.
During Sierra Leone's bloody 11-year civil war in the 1990s, there were no government-imposed lockdowns, even though people would often hide in their homes out of fear of reprisal from rebel fighters.
Sierra Leone is grinding to a halt because of the Ebola epidemic
But now, because of the ongoing Ebola epidemic, the government is effectively grinding the country to a halt by imposing mandatory lockdowns on its citizens. The first ran from September 19 to 21, when Sierra Leoneans were not be allowed to leave their homes in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus and isolate new cases. Some 350 people with Ebola were identified.
As the death toll in the country rises exponentially, Sierra Leone's President Ernest Bai Koroma announced this week that he would extend the quarantine to include another one million people in three districts and 12 tribal chiefdoms in the country. This is an unprecedented move in a country desperate to contain the outbreak. To get a sense of just how dire the situation is, read parts of the president's recent address to the nation:
The isolation of districts and chiefdoms will definitely pose great difficulties for our people in those districts. But the life of everyone and the survival of our country take precedence over these difficulties...These are trying moments for everyone in the country, but we are a resilient people, a people that have shown their ability to unite and stand up as one to overcome difficulties...We will use these strengths to confront those tendencies that undermine the fight against the disease, we will utilize our better calling to end this outbreak, and by the grace of God Almighty, we shall overcome and free our land from this evil virus.
The districts where Ebola is believed to be moving fast ‚Äî Port Loko, Bombali, Moyamba ‚Äî are now under isolation. People can't leave their homes or go to school or work. During this period, government and public-health officials are going door to door, educating people about Ebola and trying to identify patients who should be brought to containment facilities. Officials in Sierra Leone are worried that many Ebola victims are either going underground or simply unable to access care. The New York Times recently reported that the government of Sierra Leone has acknowledged the death toll is ""worse than what was being reflected in reports.""
Under-reporting is a concern in all countries most affected by Ebola right now ‚Äî Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. They are reportedly dealing with 6,000 cases and 2,900 deaths at the moment but the WHO said these figures ""vastly underestimate the true scale of the epidemic.""In its latest update on Ebola, the agency said that this epidemic amounts to ""the most severe acute public health emergency seen in modern times. Never before in recorded history has a biosafety level four pathogen infected so many people so quickly, over such a broad geographical area, for so long."" Not everyone's convinced the quarantine is a good idea
Still, not every agrees forceful measures like the quarantine in Sierra Leone are a good idea. M√©decins sans Fronti√®res has expressed the worry that mandatory isolation will ""end up driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers."" Some were also concerned that, because the latest lockdown came without a warning, people were unprepared and could go hungry. There's also the very real possibility that quarantines will deal a tragic blow to Sierra Leone's already fragile economy.
Speaking at a United Nations special meeting of world leaders on the Ebola crisis, President Barack Obama said the world needed to wake up to the deadly threat.
""If this epidemic is not stopped, this disease could cause a humanitarian catastrophe across the region,"" Obama said, adding: ""We are not moving fast enough. We are not doing enough. There is still a significant gap between where we are and where we need to be.""
Dr. Joanne Liu, international president of M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, said Ebola is killing more than just those infected by the virus. ""Mounting numbers are dying of other diseases, like malaria, because health systems have collapsed,"" she said. ""The sick continue to be turned away, only to return home and spread the virus among loved ones and neighbors.""This is the worst Ebola epidemic in history.

Killing Children: Reflections on Sierra Leones Civil War The Politic,thepolitic.org,,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://thepolitic.org/killing-children-reflections-on-sierra-leones-civil-war/,"Peter Rothpletz February 4, 2019
‚ÄúFrosty the Snowman‚Äù was playing over the cafe‚Äôs sound system when Francis said he was ready to talk about his childhood. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt a soldier,‚Äù he explained after finishing the last bite of his second breakfast sandwich. ‚ÄúSoldier is the wrong word.‚Äù
Francis and I had connected through a friend of a friend, and we spent several mornings in the latter half of December getting to know each other over cheap New Haven coffee and bacon-egg-and-cheeses. He was exceedingly polite in all of our interactions‚Äîalways insisting on opening doors or pulling out chairs for me. Any mention of Sierra Leone, however, seemed to make him skittish. He didn‚Äôt like talking about his life prior to immigrating to the United States, in the mid-2000s. In fact, he only agreed to speak with me on the condition of anonymity‚Äî‚ÄúFrancis‚Äù is not his real name. Given the subject matter, I felt this was a reasonable concession.
‚ÄúHow old were you when you got involved with the war?‚Äù I asked toward the end of our first meeting.
‚ÄúFourteen,‚Äù he replied. ***
There‚Äôs a popular, somewhat trite dinner-party refrain, alternately attributed to Einstein, Hoover, and Roosevelt, that ‚Äúold men start wars but young men fight them.‚Äù However, in Sierra Leone‚Äôs decade-long civil war, it wasn‚Äôt just young men who did the fighting: it was children, too. Some 11,000 boys and girls, in fact, are believed to have participated in the conflict. Those that survived are now in their thirties and forties, and they spend each day reflecting on atrocities that most of the world seems to have forgotten.
When the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) crossed the Liberian border into Sierra Leone in March 1991, its ranks were comprised of little more than 100 guerrillas and a small, poorly armed contingent of mercenaries from Burkina Faso. In theory, the group was a revolutionary force‚Äîan insurgency driven by the prospect of toppling Sierra Leone‚Äôs relatively weak and unloved head of state, Joseph Saidu Momoh. Years of economic decline had turned a majority of the country against Momoh, and news of a rebellion sweeping across the remote, eastern districts was initially celebrated by many Sierra Leoneans. But their support dissolved once it became clear the RUF had no interest in winning over the local population.
‚ÄúIt was a campaign of terror,‚Äù Corinne Dufka explained to me in late December. Dufka was the Human Rights Watch representative in Sierra Leone between 1999 and 2003; she spent most of her time documenting RUF atrocities through photography and hundreds of interviews. We played a spotty game of email-tag for several weeks while she was investigating ethnic clashes in central Mali. Later, once she returned to Washington, we spoke over the phone.
‚ÄúThe RUF used brutality as a way to compensate for the lack of numbers in their ranks, she told me. ‚ÄúThey used fear and intimidation to control communities.‚Äù
Systematic rape, public executions, and forced amputations were employed in combination to maximize panic among civilians. The 1990s saw a wave of ruthless, indiscriminate violence crash across the African continent, but the tactics of the RUF were exceptionally cold-blooded.
‚ÄúThey used games to terrorize people,‚Äù Dufka explained. ‚ÄúThey would arrive at a town and bring out the entire community. Then they would give a random person a riddle, and if the person couldn‚Äôt answer it, their entire family was killed in front of everyone‚Ä¶ as if the limb amputations weren‚Äôt enough, they also exercised horrific psychological torture. There were some cases where they forced parents to choose between their children,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOne would be executed and the other would be spared‚Ä¶and the parent had to decide.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat sounds like Sophie‚Äôs Choice ,‚Äù I told Dufka.
‚ÄúYes, it was very similar to Sophie‚Äôs Choice ,‚Äù she said grimly. ‚ÄúI documented several cases of that. ‚Ä¶ Children were afforded no protection.‚Äù
It‚Äôs fair to say that targeting young people was a trademark of the RUF‚Äôs terror regime. In addition to often serving as pawns in the group‚Äôs torture games, boys and girls were routinely abducted and turned into military assets. According to Dufka, kidnapping became the rebels‚Äô primary tactic in bolstering their ranks. While the girls were often utilized as ‚Äúwives‚Äù or sex slaves for RUF higher-ups, the boys were pushed onto the battlefield. ***
‚ÄúI never killed anyone,‚Äù Francis asserted toward the end of our first meeting. He gripped my hand to make sure I was listening. ‚ÄúI saw other boys do it, but I never did. ‚Ä¶ They wanted me to kill people. They gave me drugs and guns and they took everything until I had nothing, but it didn‚Äôt work. It didn‚Äôt work with me.‚Äù
Francis would reiterate these assertions a number of times in later conversations. He‚Äôd bring them up at seemingly random moments ‚Äì perhaps just to remind me. It was clear he took some degree of pride in having endured his RUF conditioning while so many others lost themselves.
Once conscripted, children were exposed to a wide range of indoctrination methods. ‚ÄúThey had to control every part of them to stop them from running away,‚Äù Dufka said. ‚ÄúThey did that by way of intimidation, they did that by way of strategically breaking the child‚Äôs ties with their community. They forced them to perpetrate atrocities against members of their own family. They forced them to kill their own parents so the children had no one to run away to.‚Äù
Horrifically, family annihilation was often only the first step in the RUF‚Äôs broader ‚Äúisolation process.‚Äù Rebel soldiers would proceed to brand abductees‚Äô chests and arms with hot razors or broken glass, destroying any hope of easy reintegration within society. Then, after the RUF marked the children‚Äôs bodies, they moved on to their minds.
‚ÄúMarijuana was used a lot,‚Äù Dufka explained to me. ‚ÄúMany children described having it put in their food after they were abducted. I interviewed a few kids who talked about just how disorienting that was for them.‚Äù
Marijuana, along with alcohol, was the primary tool the RUF used to keep new recruits numb and compliant. Early training sessions with firearms‚Äîor other efforts to desensitize the children to violence‚Äîwere preceded by heavy drug use. Later, once the boys were ready to be sent into battle, their commanders would allegedly alter the pharmaceutical load, exchanging marijuana for doses of cocaine that would be administered through small skin incisions.
‚ÄúThe drugs made boys crazy,‚Äù Francis confirmed. ‚ÄúThey made the boys worse than crazy. I mean they made the boys want to kill people. Your family is dead, you have nothing left, but you have the drugs. So maybe the drugs make the killing easy. Or maybe the drugs are the only thing you have, so you kill for more drugs. Or maybe it‚Äôs both.‚Äù
There are some who cast doubt on cocaine‚Äôs reported role in the conflict, however. Daniel Bergner, a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine , was on the ground in Sierra Leone between 2000 and 2002. To this day, he believes the stimulant may have been nothing more than a comfortable explanation for the otherwise incomprehensible.
‚ÄúThis was a horrific war, not in numbers but in atrocities, and the West, the reporters, the UN, and NGOs were desperate to explain what was happening,‚Äù he said. They would attribute it to the insanity of RUF leaders, and then they would attribute it to the megalomania of Charles Taylor. For a while, they attributed it to Gaddafi. And in the midst of that there was the narrative that what was impelling these child soldiers to commit these atrocities was the drugs. ‚Ä¶ I feel like there‚Äôs way too little evidence for the assertion that drug use allowed for the atrocities, but it crept into the popular narrative.‚Äù
‚ÄúCocaine is expensive,‚Äù Bergner continued. ‚ÄúSierra Leone was extraordinarily poor. This idea that there was a whole lot of cocaine running around somehow‚Ä¶ I have a hard time believing that.‚Äù
When I presented Bergner‚Äôs argument to Corinne Dufka, she hesitated to take a side on the matter. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt really speak to cocaine,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMost of the children I spoke to talked about marijuana, but there were some people who did describe having white powder put in their noses. I‚Äôm not sure.‚Äù
Dufka did acknowledge Bergner‚Äôs broader contention that problems exist within the ‚Äúpopular narrative‚Äù around Sierra Leone and the RUF. In the rush to document what was happening on the ground and explain why it was taking place, it‚Äôs possible some viewed nuances in the conflict as obstacles in the storytelling process.
‚ÄúThere was no simple divide between good and bad,‚Äù Bergner told me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big mistake to attribute the atrocities simply to the RUF. There were atrocities committed by RUF, by government soldiers, and by government allies. It was a complete mess.‚Äù
Dufka echoed this idea, mentioning how both the Sierra Leone military and pro-government militias exhibited reprehensible behavior throughout the war. She singled out the Kamajors, in particular. Originally a loose collective of tribal hunters, the group came to be seen as a reliable civil-defense force by the government. Cooperation intensified during the latter half of the war, despite the fact the militia made extensive use of child soldiers.
‚ÄúThe Kamajors certainly recruited children,‚Äù Dufka told me. ‚ÄúThey practiced extrajudicial executions too. Their crimes were not equatable or on the same scale with the RUF, but they absolutely committed atrocities.‚Äù By some estimates, approximately five thousand of the eleven thousand children who were conscripted into the war fought for pro-government defense forces.
‚ÄúNo, there were no really good guys,‚Äù Francis told me. ‚ÄúIt was mostly bad guys and badder guys. The whole thing had a lot of bad.‚Äù ***
In many ways, ‚ÄúOperation No Living Thing‚Äù served as the climax of Sierra Leone‚Äôs civil war. The campaign, launched on January 6, 1999, was a surprise attack on the country‚Äôs capital of Freetown, but it ultimately stretched into a three-week occupation.
RUF rebels stormed the eastern edge of the city before dawn, toting machetes, imported RPGs, and Kalashnikov rifles. There‚Äôs no way to properly describe what took place over the next several hours. It was a massacre, of course, but words and vague statistics fail to convey the hellscape that unfolded. Eyewitness reports chronicle the insurgents rounding up entire neighborhoods to be tortured, mutilated, and slaughtered.
The violence was ruthless and indiscriminate, and as the invasion force pushed further west, from Calaba Town to Kissy, the brutality seemed to escalate into outright sadism; civilians were taunted while they were hacked to death. Dufka‚Äôs Human Rights Watch report on the incursion cited several instances of infants being thrown into burning buildings and toddlers being subjected to systematic limb amputations. To some, though, the most horrific aspect of ‚ÄúOperation No Living Thing‚Äù was not how many children were victimized‚Äîit was how many children perpetrated the violence. In the report, Dufka wrote: ‚Äúchild combatants armed with pistols, rifles, and machetes actively participated in killings and massacres, severed the arms of other children, and beat and humiliated men old enough to be their grandfathers‚Ä¶ they were known and feared for their impetuosity, lack of control, and brutality.‚Äù
‚ÄúI witnessed more atrocities during that period than at any other point,‚Äù General David Richards said, reflecting on the RUF occupation. The former head of the British armed forces was in Freetown in January 1999, conducting a brief review of Sierra Leone‚Äôs military for Prime Minister Tony Blair. I communicated with General Richards‚Äîwho repeatedly insisted that I call him David‚Äîextensively throughout the fall. We emailed back and forth for several days, before I finally coaxed a Skype interview out of him. Approximately a week after I had first made contact, we met face to face, albeit on opposite sides of the Atlantic.
‚ÄúYou have to choose between indignation and horror,‚Äù Richards replied when I asked how he preserved his sanity in the midst of so much evil. The general led a second, brief reconnaissance trip in Freetown throughout February 1999 and then a much larger evacuation operation in May 2000 as the conflict worsened. It was during the latter mission that Richards made the possibly career-ending, unilateral decision to go beyond his official mandate and intervene in the war.
‚ÄúI had a battalion of the Parachute Regiment, 42 commando Royal Marines, some Special Air Service special forces, and a few Naval hands that had come ashore from the support vessels. That was it,‚Äù Richards told me. ‚ÄúAnd if I had more than one or two British casualties, I was finished because my bosses in London would have realized what I was doing.‚Äù
Determined to stop the atrocities he had witnessed in 1999, Richards contacted potential partners in the region. ‚ÄúI ultimately had to create what we called the ‚ÄòUnholy Alliance,‚Äô‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIt ended up being the rump of the Sierra Leone army, some West Side Boys, who were a very unpleasant lot, and the Kamajor militia, who were loyal to the government but were also capable of methods that I abhorred.‚Äù
In the weeks that followed, Richards and his British personnel rarely came into direct contact with the RUF. ‚ÄúThat was by design,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúMost of the hand-to-hand and close quarter fighting had to be between Sierra Leoneans.‚Äù However, Richards was constantly reminded of the gravity of his situation‚Äîhe was waging a war against children.
‚ÄúWhen you traveled, you would come across the wounded or the dead and realize that some of them are very young. And when I went through areas where fighting had been, sure enough, there were one or two that would be in their early teens. But you don‚Äôt feel disgusted with yourself,‚Äù he asserted. ‚ÄúYou feel disgusted with the men who put the young people in that position, and it makes you more determined to stop them.‚Äù
Despite the topic of our conversation, I only witnessed Richards lose his temper‚Äîor express any significant emotion‚Äîonce. I had asked him what he thought of the RUF leader Foday Sankoh, the one-time army corporal and wedding photographer who first brought the insurgency‚Äôs guerillas across the Liberian border. Richards didn‚Äôt hold back: ‚ÄúSankoh was possibly the most monstrous opponent I ever faced. I‚Äôm not aware of many warlords that would stoop to using children as weapons. He was deeply calculating, sanctimonious, and almost cheerfully evil. He played on terror in a way I haven‚Äôt really seen elsewhere. He was a bully. He was a dog.‚Äù ***
General Richards‚Äô actions ultimately saved Sierra Leone. Government forces captured Sankoh less than a month after the start of the intervention and proceeded to push RUF factions back into the eastern recesses of the country. Leaderless and facing mounting pressure from Guinea, Nigeria, and local militias, the rebels did not last long. Sierra Leone President Ahmad Kabbah formally declared an end to the civil war on January 18, 2002.
‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not over just because they say it‚Äôs over,‚Äù Francis clarified for me. ‚ÄúThey stopped the RUF but I didn‚Äôt have a home or a family anymore. I didn‚Äôt have a place to go.‚Äù
Francis claimed he escaped from his unit sometime in December 1999 or January 2000 and made his way to a camp for demobilized RUF child soldiers in Makeni, the largest city in the Northern Province of Sierra Leone. Assuming his dates are correct, this would have been approximately a year after his abduction during the 1999 occupation of Freetown. He claims to have stayed at the camp for only a few days before joining a group of families headed to Guinea. Francis asked that I not include how he eventually made it to the U.S.
‚Äú I still have nightmares, ‚Äù he told me during our last meeting. ‚ÄúI know I am safe here, but they will never go away‚Ä¶and they make sleeping very hard. Imagine if you had dreams of your mother dead in front of you or of dead neighbors and dead friends.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you,‚Äù I remember saying to Francis before we parted ways for the final time.
‚Äú Don‚Äôt be sorry for me ,‚Äù Francis replied. ‚Äú I got out. Other boys did not. ‚Äù
Today, according to Brookings, there are an estimated 300,000 minors serving in armed groups around the world‚Äîwith an average age of 12 years old. Previous Article"

Joe Biden accidentally proves Trump right with latest gaffe,redbluedivide.com,Savannah Pointer,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://redbluedivide.com/joe-biden-accidentally-proves-trump-right-with-latest-gaffe/,"Email
President Donald Trump said on Friday that he doesn‚Äôt consider former Vice President Joe Biden to be a threat to his 2020 reelection campaign, despite Biden‚Äôs support among Democrats.
Biden has recently been accused of being aggressively affectionate with women and children during his career, with two women who he previously worked with speaking out about unwanted physical attention that they received from the former vice president.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see him as a threat. I think he‚Äôs only a threat to himself,‚Äù the president told reporters as he left the White House for a trip to visit a stretch of border wall according to The New York Post .
Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúrecord is not good. He‚Äôd have to run on the Obama failed record,‚Äù Trump said.
‚ÄúYou look at what happened with so many things, North Korea, the Middle East, the economy never got going. No, I don‚Äôt think Joe‚Äôs a threat. I‚Äôd love him to be. Look, I‚Äôd be happy with any of them, to be honest,‚Äù he added.
Just hours after Trump‚Äôs comment, Biden joked about the accusations while on stage to address the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers conference. The presidential candidate shook hands with union president Lonnie Stephenson and gave him a brief hug.
‚ÄúI want you to know, I had permission to hug Lonnie,‚Äù Biden said to laughter from the crowd, The Hill reported.
Later during his address, Biden invited several children onstage and shook their hands, even putting his arm around one of the boys after pulling him close.
‚ÄúBy the way, he gave me permission to touch him,‚Äù Biden said.
While the crowd was receptive to Biden‚Äôs comments about his previous missteps, Biden‚Äôs accusers appeared to be somewhat less impressed.
Biden‚Äôs first accuser, former Nevada legislator Lucy Flores, said the comments showed Biden didn‚Äôt get it.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear @JoeBiden hasn‚Äôt reflected at all on how his inappropriate and unsolicited touching made women feel uncomfortable,‚Äù said Flores, who said that Biden kissed the back of her head and grabbed her shoulders while at an event.
‚ÄúTo make light of something as serious as consent degrades the conversation women everywhere are courageously trying to have.‚Äù "
UK: Rolls Royce Branch Introduces ‚ÄúSquat Toilet‚Äù To Fulfil ‚ÄúDiversity‚Äù Goal,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/uk-rolls-royce-branch-introduces-squat-toilet-to-fulfil-diversity-goal.html,"‚ÄúThere is now a cultural toilet available‚Äù.
Paul Joseph Watson PrisonPlanet.com April 5, 2019
A Rolls Royce branch in the UK has introduced ‚Äúsquat toilets‚Äù on its premises as part of its drive for ‚Äúdiversity and inclusion‚Äù.
In an email exclusively obtained by Summit News which was sent out to staff at a Rolls Royce branch in Derby, bosses write, ‚ÄúAs part of Rolls Royce‚Äôs ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion, we are pleased to announce that there is now a cultural toilet available.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe toilet (also known as a squat toilet) is open with immediate effect,‚Äù states the email.
Squat toilets are mainly used in Africa and the Middle East. The usually consist of just a toilet pan or bowl at floor level and do not have a seat.
Similar toilets were installed in a shopping center in Rochdale, which has a high Muslim population, back in 2010 ‚Äúafter bosses went on a cultural awareness course.‚Äù A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Back in 2016, staff at the University of Sheffield had to post signs showing foreign students how to use toilets, advising them not to squat on the seat, after ‚Äúcleaners grew fed up of cleaning up mess‚Äù.
A lengthy guide was also posted on the Study Links website explaining to international students how to use the bathroom properly.
Some people claim that squat toilets are healthier for bowel functions, although this isn‚Äôt the reason they‚Äôre being installed in western countries.

Education But five school days a month, Adams skips the uniform and dons business attire. On those days, after a morning assembly, she bypasses the classrooms and hops instead into a van bound for Essex County College. There Adams works in the human resources department from 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. or so, scheduling r√©sum√© appointments, doing clerical work, and generally keeping the place functioning. Far from being a distraction, this opportunity to work while going to school is what drew Adams to Christ the King in the first place. ‚ÄúI thought it would be a good school for me to learn about business,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI would like to be an entrepreneur.‚Äù
Few teenagers are so concretely focused on their future careers. But Adams‚Äô attitude is not unusual for the 89 freshmen at Christ the King Prep, part of a recently formed national network of Catholic schools that combine school and work. In the process, these ‚ÄúCristo Rey‚Äù (Spanish for ‚ÄúChrist the King‚Äù) schools have stumbled on a new business model for private urban education‚Äîone that asks students like Adams to largely pay their own way.
At the 19 schools in the network (three new ones are opening this fall in Brooklyn, Detroit, and the west side of Chicago), four-student teams share entry-level clerical jobs at area employers. In exchange, these companies pay the schools $20,000 to $30,000 for each team. The subsidy of $5,000 to $7,500 per student keeps tuition low enough (usually around $2,500) that a prep school education becomes feasible for poor families.
This business model was born of necessity. But as the Cristo Rey Network has discovered in the 12 years since the first school opened in Chicago, the benefits go beyond financial sustainability. Introducing inner-city children to corporate America shows them the jobs they can have if they study hard and go to college. And that‚Äôs what the vast majority of Cristo Rey‚Äôs predominantly Hispanic and African-American graduates do.
The schools are also raising interesting questions about the financing of education. Sociologists have long pointed to systems of free, compulsory public schools as the international gold standard. There are many arguments for subsidizing education, and it‚Äôs certainly tragic when parents in poor countries pull their kids out of school because they can‚Äôt afford the fees. But with only half of public high school students in America‚Äôs 50 largest cities graduating on time, perhaps the pendulum has swung too far in one direction. The successes of Cristo Rey schools suggest that one answer to America‚Äôs educational woes is not asking more of taxpayers but asking more of the students themselves.
Every year, according to America‚Äôs Promise Alliance (a children‚Äôs advocacy group run by former Secretary of State Colin Powell), more than 1 million students turn down additional free education and drop out of school. Even those who do graduate often fail to obtain the college education necessary for higher-paying jobs. In the U.S., according to 2005 Census Bureau data, only 18 percent of African-American adults and 12 percent of Hispanic adults have bachelor‚Äôs degrees. (The figures are 31 percent for non- Hispanic whites and 49 percent for Asian Americans.)
‚ÄòA Lot of People Thought It Was Pretty Crazy‚Äô The first Cristo Rey school was founded in Chicago in 1996 to combat such frustrating statistics. A local order of Jesuits wanted to offer Hispanic children in the low-income Pilsen/Little Village neighborhood a college preparatory education, but the priests had no idea how to fund such a school. Although the Catholic Church has long tried to serve the poor, its inner-city schools have faced increasingly stark economic realities in recent years. Inner-city parents (or, often, grandparents) simply cannot pay anything near the per capita operating cost. In this era of multimillion-dollar sexual abuse lawsuits, Catholic schools can‚Äôt necessarily rely on archdiocesan support either. Fund raising is time-consuming and unreliable, and costs have risen as fewer women and men join the religious orders that taught for pittances at Catholic schools in the past.
Faced with these challenges, the Jesuits decided to meet with Richard Murray, a management consultant who had helped the group with fund raising ideas before. Murray gave the matter some thought. He recalled the internships he himself had done during school. Not only had he learned a lot from those jobs, but he figured his work had provided some value to his employers. So he suggested the students themselves could work in entry-level jobs to pay for their education at the proposed school. If teams of students shared jobs, there would still be enough time for instruction, particularly with an extended school day (a sound idea in its own right, since many inner-city children come home after school to empty houses).
It was an intriguing idea, although ‚Äúa lot of people thought it was pretty crazy,‚Äù says Jeff Thielman, the Chicago school‚Äôs first director of development and currently the vice president of the Cristo Rey Network. ‚ÄúWe were in a neighborhood people had given up on.‚Äù Would young people with limited English skills, living in single-parent homes in high-crime neighborhoods, be able to hold down jobs?
Despite such doubts, the Jesuits agreed to try, and eventually the Cristo Rey Jesuit High School of Chicago was incorporated as both a school and something akin to a temp agency. The students would be the employees of the temp agency, which would handle all payroll taxes. They would sign a contract assigning 100 percent of their school-year wages to the academy.
Then the Jesuits set about drumming up jobs at Chicago employers. They leaned on Catholic businessmen and then worked their way out through their professional networks. Eventually they found enough positions to place the students who had enrolled in the school for fall 1996. The Rev. John Foley, one of the Jesuits, likes to say that he wanted to ‚Äúhide under the desk‚Äù when he first sent his rather rough new charges out into the Chicago business community. One kid reportedly stood outside a skyscraper for a long time, unable to figure out the revolving door.
But soon employers were calling to compliment the Jesuits on the most eager temps they‚Äôd ever seen. ‚ÄúNo one quite expected that the kids could perform to the level they were performing in the work world,‚Äù Thielman says. ‚ÄúWe found tremendous talent and tremendous potential among young people in that neighborhood.‚Äù
The Chicago school began to draw attention both from the news media and within the Catholic Church, and before long other groups wanted to start their own schools based on the same financial model. Soon a $9 million gift from venture capitalist B.J. Cassin enabled the formation of the national Cristo Rey Network, which standardized the process of creating a school. Portland‚Äôs De La Salle North Catholic High School opened in 2001. Los Angeles‚Äô Verbum Dei High School, a fixture in Watts, restructured itself to become a Cristo Rey school in 2002. A $9.9 million gift from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2003 enabled the network to open six schools in 2004, in places ranging from Cleveland to Tucson to New York City. Another $6 million Gates Foundation gift in 2006 provided start-up capital for seven schools that opened in 2007. These included Newark‚Äôs Christ the King Prep, which now enrolls 89 freshmen, and will scale up as it enrolls new and bigger classes of freshmen until it reaches 500 or so students in 2012. Three schools are opening this fall, and four other groups, in Houston, San Diego, San Francisco, and Cincinnati, are undertaking feasibility studies for opening in fall of 2009 or 2010. Foley says the network has a list of about 40 cities where a Cristo Rey school ‚Äúwould be a possibility.‚Äù
These start-ups are all committed to enrolling only low-income kids; network-wide, 72 percent of students qualify for the federal free or reduced-price lunch program. The schools are also committed to sending the vast majority of their graduates to college; of the 318 students who graduated from Cristo Rey Network schools in 2007, 316 were accepted to a two- or four-year college. That‚Äôs better than 99 percent. (Nationwide, just 67 percent of students who graduate from high school start college shortly thereafter, and in big cities that figure can be much lower. Chicago Mayor Richard Daley held a press conference last spring to boast that the Chicago public schools had sent almost half of the class of 2007 to two- or four-year colleges.)
Such statistics make the staff of Christ the King Prep optimistic, although they still face plenty of challenges. Few things work right in Newark. In April a jury convicted former mayor Sharpe James on five counts of fraud. The public middle schools that supply many of Christ the King Prep‚Äôs students are chronically failing; some Newark schools face escalating sanctions under the federal No Child Left Behind Act for failing to show adequate progress for seven years in a row. The district is neck-deep in improvement programs these days, and indeed 46 percent of 11th-graders passed the mathematics portion of New Jersey‚Äôs High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA) in 2007, up from 29 percent in 2003. Yet 46 percent is still frustratingly low, and that figure doesn‚Äôt include the scores of kids who have already dropped out by the 11th grade. It is also averaged over a district that includes a few decent magnet schools. In 2007 only 14 percent of students at Newark‚Äôs run-of-the-mill Malcolm X Shabazz High School were deemed at or above proficient on the mathematics section of the HSPA.
Activists sometimes like to blame poor school performances on a lack of funding, but this argument is simply laughable in Newark. According to the Census Bureau report Public Education Finances: 2006, Newark spends $21,295 on each of its 41,857 pupils. Across America, the average school spends about half that. Costs are often higher in cities, but the New York City schools spend just $14,951 per pupil, according to the Census Bureau; Washington, D.C., spends $13,446."
Education Dept has stalled on approving debt relief for defrauded students,thehill.com,Tal Axelrod,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/437662-education-dept-has-stalled-on-approving-debt-relief-for-defrauded,"Education Dept has stalled on approving debt relief for defrauded students By Tal Axelrod - 04/05/19 07:49 PM EDT
The Department of Education did not approve any applications for federal student loan relief in the second half of 2018, according to new department data reviewed by The New York Times.
The Times reported that the data likely means students defrauded by their colleges may not be able to turn to Washington for help in the near future. ADVERTISEMENT
The department, according to the Times, did not approve or turn down a single relief claim filed under the borrower defense rule from June to December, despite a federal ruling that the agency‚Äôs deliberate delay was illegal.
A judge ruled in October that the Education Department must enforce a rule implemented under the Obama administration that broadened and expedited loan relief for defrauded students after many of them were cheated by for-profit institutions, the Times reported.
More than 150,000 pending claims now await approval from the agency, more than doubling the number the department inherited from the previous administration. The Education Department has blamed lawsuits filed by advocates seeking a more robust response to loan relief applications for the delay.
‚ÄúPending litigation has slowed down the department‚Äôs processing to provide relief to additional borrowers,‚Äù Education Department spokeswoman Liz Hill told the Times. ‚ÄúWe will fully implement the 2016 borrower defense regulations and ensure those who qualify for discharge receive it.‚Äù
The department ‚Äúcontinues to assess alternatives to provide a fair, balanced and consistent approach for legitimate borrower defense applications,‚Äù as the discharge 22,000 approved applications are delayed.
Hill added that the department is making efforts to expand its ability to manage applications, which are reportedly streaming in at a rate of 2,000 per week, according to the Times.
The Education Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill.
Elizabeth (Betsy) Dee DeVos Education Dept has stalled on approving debt relief for defrauded students How Democrats learned to stop worrying and love teachers Dem lawmaker calls for DeVos to resign, cites use of 'racist research' MORE defended for-profit institutions when she was grilled on Capitol Hill last month over the backlog, saying there was blame to be pinned ""on both sides.""
‚ÄúNo student should be defrauded, and if fraud is involved, there are consequences, and there will be consequences,‚Äù DeVos said. ‚ÄúBut we should not be judging institutions by their tax status. Let‚Äôs be very honest here; there are bad actors on both sides of the equation.‚Äù
DeVos has criticized the Obama-era program as an offer of ‚Äúfree money‚Äù and has sought to curtail its scope to focus solely on forgiving debts of students who failed to get gainful employment and can provide proof they were otherwise harmed.
Hill said the Education Department under DeVos has discharged nearly 50,000 borrower defense claims totaling more than $534 million. Many of the claims were left over from the Obama administration, according to the Times.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing stopping Secretary DeVos from providing relief to struggling borrowers today, and she needs to begin approving claims immediately so students who were cheated out of their education and savings get the relief they are entitled to,‚Äù Murray said in a statement to the Times."

Donald Trump is now fighting a losing battle on all fronts - Palmer Report,www.palmerreport.com,Bill Palmer,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/losing-battles-fronts-trump/17207/,"Donald Trump is now fighting a losing battle on all fronts Bill Palmer | 7:07 pm EDT April 5, 2019 Line
Donald Trump announced this afternoon through his lawyers that he‚Äôs going to fight the House Ways and Means Committee‚Äôs decision to formally seek his tax returns from the Treasury Department. That‚Äôs all well and good, but Trump has absolutely no legal standing on this matter, not as a private citizen, and not as the President of the United States. He will, automatically, lose this fight. It‚Äôs far from the only losing battle he‚Äôs waging right now.
Trump and his newly handpicked Attorney General William Barr are also trying to fight against the Mueller report becoming public. But while the law isn‚Äôt 100% clear cut against Trump in this instance, there is overwhelming public support for the report to surface, and even Mueller‚Äôs own team is beginning to reveal what‚Äôs really in the report ‚Äì so Trump will lose this battle, eventually if not necessarily immediately.
Michael Cohen has sent a twelve page letter to Congress, asserting that Donald Trump did in fact conspire with Russia to alter the outcome of the 2016 election. To that end, Cohen says he‚Äôs found a hard drive full of records that implicate Trump in this conspiracy, and that he‚Äôs going to turn it all over to Congress. Trump is trying to fight back against this by merely invoking delusion , insisting that whatever Cohen has, it must be ‚Äúold news,‚Äù even though Trump has no way of knowing this.
Last night it was revealed that Capital One has been secretly working with House Democrats since early March with regard to Donald Trump‚Äôs apparently incriminating financial records. Trump has no idea how to fight that. Nor can he derail the whistleblower who has exposed his security clearance scandal, which just set off an array of subpoenas. If Trump were fighting one losing battle, he might be able to simply kick it down the road. But he‚Äôs now fighting losing battles on all sides ‚Äì and no one ever wins that way. "

Williams worked tirelessly before the election using a complete campaign plan that he had designed. He presumed around 400 people would vote and made sure to knock on their doors until he spoke with all of them. He put out yard signs and doorhangers, with 12 volunteers helping him.
Williams illustrated to his constituents how the city‚Äôs codes and ordinances were hurting the local businesses. He also pointed out that the city charges homeowners a storm drainage fee even though homeowners themselves are responsible for the drainage.
He also made sure that those who supported him got out to vote.

The government was due to put out an annual report on reducing carbon pollution, but there had been no new federal or provincial policy measures that would have caused any reductions.
‚ÄúThere are no new federal or provincial GHG (greenhouse gas) policy measures to include since the 2013 report,‚Äù Michael Martin, then deputy environment minister, told his minister Leona Aglukkaq, according to an internal memorandum dated Sept. 19, 2014."

TORONTO ‚Äî MediaPro, the Spanish media company that has partnered with Canada Soccer and the Canadian Premier League, has announced a new streaming channel called OneSoccer 24/7.
The channel will carry live coverage of all 98 CPL matches this season as well as home matches involving the Canadian men's and women's national teams plus all 24 Canadian Championship matches in 2019.
The new channel has yet to announce its price-point, however.
Mediapro says some Canadian Championship matches will be simulcast on ""a national linear broadcaster."" OneSoccer will also air a selection of League 1 Ontario women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs games starting in 2020.
Mediapro struck a 10-year deal with Canada Soccer Business, which represents Canada's national teams as well as the fledgling CPL, in February.
Mediapro's business includes producing soccer games around the world ‚Äî it handled the recent Canada-French Guiana CONCACAF Nations League qualifying game in Vancouver ‚Äî and has produced games at the FIFA World Cup.
Mediapro, which has some 70 production trucks worldwide, currently produces games in 16 different leagues.
In Spain, Mediapro has created channels full of La Liga content. It plans to do the same in France with Ligue 1 starting in 2020 and sees Canada as a chance to get in on the ground floor with the new Canadian pro league about to kick off.
The seven-team CPL consists of Victoria's Pacific FC, FC Edmonton, Calgary's Cavalry FC, Winnipeg's Valour FC, Hamilton's Forge FC, north Toronto's York 9 FC and HFX Halifax's Wanderers.
The CPL season kicks off April 27."
"After eight games on the road, the Arrows bring pro rugby union to Toronto",www.nationalnewswatch.com,"Neil Davidson, The Canadian Press",04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/05/after-eight-games-on-the-road-the-arrows-bring-pro-rugby-union-to-toronto/,"By Neil Davidson, The Canadian Press ‚Äî Apr 5 2019
TORONTO ‚Äî After eight straight games on the road, the Toronto Arrows are finally coming home.
The Arrows host New Orleans' NOLA Gold, the top team in Major League Rugby, on Sunday as pro rugby union debuts in Toronto.
It's the first of eight straight home games for Toronto, which went 4-4-0 on the road. Given the constant roster shuffling between Canada and the expansion Arrows during the Americas Rugby Championship, going .500 on the road is more than a decent start.
""We were quite happy,"" said Arrows co-founder Bill Webb. ""We think we're well-positioned for the home stretch. Our goal was to be at least .500. We could easily have been slightly better than that. A couple of games were really close.""
Webb is proud of the Arrows team culture. Most of the team come from the Ontario Blues, so the new MLR side already had some history.
Chris Silverthorn, the Arrows' director of rugby, has added some New Zealand and Uruguayan talent to the Canadian core.
""The guys have been incredibly engaged,"" said Webb. ""I had one player, who has played professionally and various parts of the world with the national team, tell me this is the best culture he has ever been around on a rugby team.""
""They're playing for one another, they're playing for their families,"" he added. ""The families have been incredibly enthusiastic and supportive because these guys are making a lot of sacrifices with travel and a busy training schedule.
""So I'm just really proud of what they've accomplished. And excited to see what we do in the back half of the season because I think we're going to make a really strong push here.""
New Orleans beat visiting Toronto 36-31 in the season opener for both Jan. 26. The Arrows, trailing 24-7 at the half, rallied for 24 points in the second half but their spirited comeback fell just short.
New Orleans (6-2-0) is captained by hooker Eric Howard, who is supported by fellow Canadian internationals Kyle Baillie and Hubert Buydens.
Howard was part of the MLR team of the week along with Toronto's Rob Brouwer, Mike Sheppard and Lucas Rumball. Sheppard also won player of the week honours for his work in Toronto's 64-31 win at the Utah Warriors last week. The lock led the team in tackles and was one of nine different Arrows to score a try.
Saturday's game will be played on artificial turf at York Alumni Stadium, which seats some 2,500.
""I think we're going to have a pretty healthy, excited crowd on Sunday,"" said Webb.
Silverthorn has made two changes to the starting lineup that beat Utah. Hooker Andrew Quattrin returns from injury and flanker John Moonlight returns for his second match of the season.
Sixteen of the 23 players named to the Arrows match-day squad started their rugby careers at Ontario clubs. The squad includes 14 full internationals ‚Äî 13 from Canada and one from Uruguay ‚Äî with a combined cap total of 240.
After four games at York, the Arrows will play their final four home games of the season at Lamport Stadium.
Toronto Arrows Lineup
Rob Brouwer, Andrew Quattrin, Morgan Mitchell, Mike Sheppard, Paul Ciulini, John Moonlight, Peter Milazzo, Lucas Rumball, Andrew Ferguson, Sam Malcolm, Dan Moor, Guiseppe du Toit, Spencer Jones, Avery Oitomen, Gaston Mieres.

Saskatchewan premier reflects on own crash ahead of Humboldt anniversary,www.nationalnewswatch.com,"Stephanie Taylor, The Canadian Press",04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/05/saskatchewan-premier-reflects-on-own-crash-ahead-of-humboldt-anniversary/,"By Stephanie Taylor, The Canadian Press ‚Äî Apr 5 2019
REGINA ‚Äî Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe says he feels for everyone involved in the Humboldt Broncos crash and thinks daily about the deadly collision he was involved in years ago.
""It's one that weighs on me heavily every day of my life,"" he told The Canadian Press in an interview Friday.
""It's part of me.""
Moe was driving on a gravel road to his family's farm near Shellbrook, Sask., in 1997, when he failed to come to a complete stop as he approached a highway. The sun was on the horizon.
A woman in the vehicle he collided with died.
""You dig deep as to why and you also dig deep as to how can I use this, in my case, a personal tragedy, to make a difference as you move forward,"" he said.
Moe received a ticket for driving without due care and attention and for failing to come to a complete stop.
In the Broncos crash last April, it was an inexperienced truck driver who blew through a stop sign and into the path of the junior hockey team's bus at a rural intersection near Tisdale, Sask.
Sixteen people died and 13 were injured.
The trucker, Jaskirat Singh Sidhu of Calgary, was sentenced last month to eight years for dangerous driving.
A memorial is being held in Humboldt, Sask., on Saturday to mark the one-year anniversary of the tragedy. Moe is attending the service with his wife.
He said he doesn't compare the collision he was involved in with the Broncos crash or any other experience.
He has publicly talked about the 1997 crash before. In the leadup to the 2018 Saskatchewan Party leadership race, he said he had been open with his constituents in Rosthern-Shellbrook and gave details to the media.
He doesn't have any contact with the family of the woman who died, he said.
As a father of two, Moe said, he can't imagine what the families of the Broncos victims have gone through. And he believes the truck driver will feel the impact of his actions beyond any punishment handed to him by the courts.
""Nobody sets out one morning with any intent of being in a car accident of any type,"" Moe said.
""To some degree I feel for Mr. Sidhu and his family.""

"Toronto Maple Leafs recall Hutchinson, give Sparks a break to find his game",www.nationalnewswatch.com,The Canadian Press,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/05/toronto-maple-leafs-recall-goalie-michael-hutchinson-from-ahl-marlies/,"By The Canadian Press ‚Äî Apr 5 2019
TORONTO ‚Äî Michael Hutchinson was surprised as anyone when he got the news.
The Toronto Maple Leafs recalled the veteran goalie from the American Hockey League on Friday to give struggling backup Garret Sparks a break with the first round of the NHL playoffs just around the corner.
""Definitely unexpected,"" Hutchinson told reporters at the team's practice facility. ""I'm really excited to be a part of this and help the team out in any way I can.""
The move was preceded by a string of shaky starts from Sparks, who will be given a 10-day stint with the team's goalie coaches to try and rediscover his game.
In the meantime, Hutchinson will serve as Toronto's No. 2 behind starter Frederik Andersen when the Leafs close out the regular season Saturday in Montreal against the Canadiens, and when the team opens its first-round series on the road against the Boston Bruins next week.
Sparks led the Toronto Marlies to the AHL's Calder Cup title last spring, registering a 31-9-1 record, a 1.79 goals-against average and a .936 saves percentage in the regular season. The 25-year-old from Elmhurst, Ill., then went 14-5 in the playoffs with a 2.22 GAA and a .915 save percentage.
The Leafs elected in the fall to go with Sparks as their backup instead of 35-year-old Curtis McElhinney, who was claimed by the Carolina Hurricanes on waivers before the season.
Sparks got off to a decent start in his first full NHL campaign, but currently owns a 8-9-1 mark with a 3.15 GAA and a .902 save percentage.
""We need him to get (his game back), he needs to get it back,"" Leafs head coach Mike Babcock said. ""It's real important as an organization that we help him out and that he helps himself.""
Babcock stressed the team-imposed hiatus for Sparks, who dealt with a concussion earlier this season, doesn't mean he's done with the organization.
""What we tried to do, because we believe in Sparky, is give him every opportunity,"" said the coach. ""We went back to the well a number of times and then when we didn't get it worked out or when it didn't get where we needed it to we made this decision.""
The 29-year-old Hutchinson had a 2-3-0 record with a 2.64 GAA and a .914 save percentage in five appearances with the Leafs after he was acquired from the Florida Panthers in late December.
Hutchinson was pressed into service at the time with Andersen and Sparks both nursing injuries. In 23 games with the Marlies, the native of Barrie, Ont., is 14-5-3 with a 2.70 GAA and a .910 save percentage.
In 111 career NHL appearances with Toronto, Florida and the Winnipeg Jets, Hutchinson owns a 46-43-13 mark with a 2.70 GAA, a .908 save percentage, and four shutouts.
An emergency recall the first time he was summoned to the NHL by Toronto, Hutchinson would have to pass through waivers to be sent back down to the AHL.

Trudeau said the money ‚Äî which will come over the course of 10 years with $810 million given as a loan and $530 million as a direct investment ‚Äî will help address Toronto's housing affordability challenges.
The prime minister acknowledged that the city has gained a reputation for sky-high housing prices that alienate people across the income spectrum.
""Never mind buying a home, even an apartment is out of reach for far too many people,"" he said. ""When new parents are struggling to find a place they can afford and seniors are worried about making rent, we have to do something about it.""
The federal funds will help renovate 58,000 affordable housing units being managed by the Toronto Community Housing Corporation.
""Having a roof over your head doesn't cut it if the windows won't close or the plumbing is dodgy,"" Trudeau said. ""Investing in affordable housing is about giving everyone a real and fair chance at success.""
Renovations on Toronto's community housing units are set to begin this spring ‚Äî something Toronto Mayor John Tory said was a long time coming.
""As far back as 2007, the city council recognized the need to repair the buildings, which were by then 35 or 40 years old. But the city couldn't do it alone, and we started at that time to ask for the other governments to help,"" he said.
""Until today, we did not have a partner in making those repairs.""
The CEO of the Toronto Community Housing Corporation also welcomed the federal announcement.
""The co-investment fund brings us closer than ever before to the day when all our buildings are in good repair and all our tenants live in clean, safe, well-maintained homes,"" said Kevin Marshman.

VANCOUVER ‚Äî A man convicted of criminally harassing his ex-wife through a revenge website has been charged with breaching a probation order.
The RCMP say Patrick Fox was arrested Thursday in Burnaby, B.C.

SOUTHAMPTON: Late goals by Mohamed Salah and Jordan Henderson earned Liverpool a crucial 3-1 victory at Southampton to move them back to the top of the Premier League on Friday.
For the second week running Liverpool looked like losing ground on Manchester City in a titanic title race, but once again Juergen Klopp‚Äôs side would not be denied as they edged a step closer to a first league title since 1990.
With games running out they lead City by two points, although Pep Guardiola‚Äôs champions have a game in hand.
Locked at 1-1 Liverpool were laying siege to the Southampton goal but it was Salah, who had not scored for eight games, who provided the moment of magic they desperately required in the 80th minute, racing away to score a majestic solo goal.
It was Salah‚Äôs 50th Premier League goal for Liverpool and six minutes later Henderson, on as a substitute, wrapped it up with a close-range finish.
Shane Long had made it a nail-biting night for Liverpool‚Äôs massed ranks of supporters when he fired relegation-threatened Southampton ahead in the ninth minute.
But Liverpool recovered from a surprisingly sluggish start and Naby Keita‚Äôs header, his first goal for the club, levelled the scores before halftime.
Victory lifted Liverpool to 82 points from 33 games, with City on 80 from 32.
‚ÄúIt was very big. Every game is massive. We‚Äôve got to win every game. I thought we showed great character in the first half,‚Äù Henderson told Sky Sports. ‚ÄúIt was a big performance in the second half and a big result.‚Äù
Liverpool needed a stoppage-time winner to beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 at Anfield last weekend and they were forced to do things the hard way again at St Mary‚Äôs.
They were caught cold early on and Long punished them, calmly firing home after Ryan Bertrand‚Äôs cross was flicked on.
It could have been worse with Long almost making it 2-0 but Keita‚Äôs header calmed the nerves in the away ranks.
Liverpool dominated after the break but Southampton defended tenaciously, even if they were lucky when Maya Yoshida appeared to bring down Keita in the penalty area.
With the clock ticking down and Southampton enjoying a brief flurry of pressure, Liverpool broke and Salah drove forward at pace, making around 50 metres without a challenge before firing the ball past Angus Gunn.
Southampton, who remain five points above the drop zone, were flattened and Liverpool were spared any late frights when Roberto Firmino found Henderson who stroked home.
An ecstatic Klopp joined in the celebrations on the pitch with his players who face Chelsea at home next week.
‚ÄúWe have 82 points now, that is massive in this crazy league and everyone is waiting for us. I am really proud. It is incredible,‚Äù the German said. "
Does China have feet of clay?,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,FMT,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2019/04/06/does-china-have-feet-of-clay/,"Does China have feet of clay? By - April 6, 2019 7:30 AM
Chinese President Xi Jinping seems to be on a roll. He has sent a rocket to the dark side of the moon, built artificial islands on contested reefs in the South China Sea, and recently enticed Italy to break ranks with its European partners and sign on to China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative.
Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump‚Äôs unilateralist posture has reduced America‚Äôs soft power and influence.
China‚Äôs economic performance over the past four decades has been truly impressive. It is now the main trading partner for more than a hundred countries compared to about half that number for the United States. Its economic growth has slowed, but its official 6% annual rate is more than twice the American rate.
Conventional wisdom projects that China‚Äôs economy will surpass that of the US in size in the coming decade.
Perhaps. But it is also possible that Xi has feet of clay.
No one knows what China‚Äôs future holds, and there is a long history of faulty predictions of systemic collapse or stagnation.
While I don‚Äôt think either is likely, the conventional wisdom exaggerates China‚Äôs strengths.
Westerners see the divisions and polarisation in their democracies, but China‚Äôs successful efforts to conceal its problems cannot make them go away.
Sinologists who know much more than I do describe at least five major long-term problems confronting China.
First, there is the country‚Äôs unfavorable demographic profile. China‚Äôs labor force peaked in 2015, and it has passed the point of easy gains from urbanisation.
The population is aging, and China will face major rising health costs for which it is poorly prepared. This will impose a significant burden on the economy and exacerbate growing inequality.
Second, China needs to change its economic model. In 1978, Deng Xiaoping wisely switched China from Maoist autarky to the East Asian export-led growth model successfully pioneered by Japan and Taiwan.
Today, however, China has outgrown the model and the tolerance of foreign governments that made it possible.
For example, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is focusing on the lack of reciprocity, subsidies to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and coerced intellectual property transfer that have allowed China to tilt the playing field in its favour.
Europeans are also complaining about these issues. Moreover, China‚Äôs intellectual property policies and rule-of-law deficiencies are discouraging foreign investment and costing it the international political support such investment often brings. And China‚Äôs high rates of government investment and subsidies to SOEs disguise inefficiency in the allocation of capital.
Third, while China for more than three decades picked the low-hanging fruit of relatively easy reforms, the changes it needs now are much more difficult to introduce: an independent judiciary, rationalisation of SOEs, and liberalisation or elimination of the hukou system of residential registration, which limits mobility and fuels inequality.
Moreover, Deng‚Äôs political reforms to separate the party and the state have been reversed by Xi.
That brings us to the fourth problem. Ironically, China has become a victim of its success. The Leninist model imposed by Mao in 1949 fit well with Chinese imperial tradition, but rapid economic development has changed China and its political needs.
China has become an urban middle-class society, but its ruling elites remain trapped in circular political reasoning. They believe that only the Communist Party can save China and thus that any reforms must strengthen the Party‚Äôs monopoly on power.
But this is exactly what China does not need. Deep structural reforms that can move China away from reliance on high levels of government investment and SOEs are opposed by Party elites who derive tremendous wealth from the existing system.
Xi‚Äôs anti-corruption campaign can‚Äôt overcome this resistance; instead, it is merely discouraging initiative. On a recent visit to Beijing, a Chinese economist told me that Xi‚Äôs campaign cost China 1% of GDP per year.
A Chinese businessman told me real growth was less than half the official figure. Perhaps this can be countered by the private sector‚Äôs dynamism, but even there, fear of losing of control is increasing the Party‚Äôs role.
Finally, there is China‚Äôs soft-power deficit. Xi has proclaimed a ‚ÄúChinese Dream‚Äù of a return to global greatness. As economic growth slows and social problems increase, the Party‚Äôs legitimacy will increasingly rest on such nationalist appeals.
Over the past decade, China has spent billions of dollars to increase its attractiveness to other countries, but international public opinion polls show that China has not gained a good return on its investment.
Repressing troublesome ethnic minorities, jailing human-rights lawyers, creating a surveillance state, and alienating creative members of civil society such as the renowned artist Ai Weiwei undercut China‚Äôs attraction in Europe, Australia, and the US.
Such policies may not hurt China‚Äôs reputation in some authoritarian states, but modern authoritarianism is not ideologically based the way communism was.
Decades ago, young revolutionaries around the world were inspired by Mao‚Äôs teachings.
Today, although ‚ÄúXi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics‚Äù has been enshrined in the Party constitution, few young people in other countries are carrying that banner.
China is a country with great strengths, but also important weaknesses. American strategy should avoid exaggerating either.
China will increase in importance, and the US-China relationship will be a cooperative rivalry. We must not forget either part of that description.
No country, including China, is likely to surpass the US in overall power in the next decade or two, but the US will have to learn to share power as China and others gain strength. By maintaining its international alliances and domestic institutions, America will have a comparative advantage.

Rantau‚Äôs orchids a blooming business for the Ng family,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Vinodh Pillai,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/04/06/rantaus-orchids-a-blooming-business-for-the-ng-family/,"Rantau‚Äôs orchids a blooming business for the Ng family By April 6, 2019 7:00 AM The Seremban Orchid Nursery.
SEREMBAN: Ng Zhi Hui‚Äôs orchid nursery is a riot of colours but it‚Äôs easy to miss if you‚Äôre driving around Seremban, or on the way to nearby Port Dickson.
The Seremban Orchid Nursery is nestled in the heart of Mambau, a township some 10km from the city. It was started 34 years ago by Ng‚Äôs father, whose childhood hobby was growing orchids.
Now, it is a lucrative source of income for the father-son duo who rake in monthly sales of up to RM50,000.
The bulk of their customers are high-end collectors who are always on the look-out for prize specimens. Rare species at their nursery can go for up to several thousand ringgit, not including the hybrid species with which they experiment.
One particular hybrid specimen, for instance, was named and gifted to former menteri besar Mohamad Hasan. But most of the plants cost anywhere from RM40 to RM50 per pot. Ng Zhi Hui, from Rahang, Negeri Sembilan, runs the Seremban Orchid Nursery with his father.
Ng and his father bring in several large shipments a year, sometimes 3,000 to 5,000 orchids at a time which require the use of five-tonne lorries.
There are only a handful of orchid farms in Seremban, so business is good and competition is low. During Chinese New Year and Hari Raya, especially, sales can double and sometimes even triple.
Ng, 31, is a marketing graduate. He began working with his father full-time about four years ago, and told FMT that he always expected to take over the family business.
For Ng, a regular day at the nursery entails checking each of the thousand-over plants to see if they need watering. This would be a monumental task if not for the special moss they use for the orchids. It is 10 times more expensive than regular soil, but it means that Ng and his team of five only need to water the plants once a week.
This moss is sourced from South America while the baby orchid plants ‚Äì anywhere from six to eight months old ‚Äì come from Selangor. Orchid seedlings at the Seremban Orchid Nursery.
The plants are sent to Ng‚Äôs nursery in glass bottles. For the next five years, he and his team monitor their growth, gradually increasing the size of pots.
Other orchids, especially those that are found at higher altitudes, grow comfortably in greenhouses which trap cold air from air-conditioners as opposed to warm air.
It‚Äôs a tedious job, but orchid farmers like Ng must be constantly on their toes. Everything Ng knows, he attributes to his father.
‚ÄúI learned all that I know from my sifu,‚Äù he told FMT.
Ng‚Äôs father, a seasoned judge at orchid pageants and international events, was just recently in Taiwan for a show. He was once part of the Seremban Orchid Society, but the group was disbanded after a drop in its membership.
This doesn‚Äôt mean that orchid growing is a dying interest, though.
‚ÄúFor now, it won‚Äôt die because there are still a lot of people who enjoy collecting orchids,‚Äù Ng said.
‚ÄúEven people who are in their 60s or 70s take up orchid growing as a hobby when they are retired.‚Äù
Orchids can live for decades if they are not exposed to bacterial infections or bad weather. Perhaps the same will go for Ng and his fellow orchid farmers. "

PolitiFact collectively asked the internet to hold its beer as it took it upon itself to fact check a photoshopped image based off of one of the most viral photos of 2018.
But first, some context.
As many of you well know, former VP Joe Biden has come under fire for his incredibly creepy behavior around women over the years. Numerous photos of the 2020 hopeful show him standing behind women, leaning in uncomfortably close with his face either in their neck or their cheek.
Naturally, the internet began having a field day with this as photos of Biden in random situations began popping up in various parts of the web.
New York Magazine chronicled a few of them, but one photo in particular that made the rounds apparently caught the eye of PolitiFact, who sprang into action. Trending Surprise: Jussie Smollett Hasn't Paid $130,000 in Fines, and Chicago Is Preparing to Lower the Boom on Him Sister Toldjah
The photo was part of the video released by Benny Johnson that showed Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) smiling and straightening his tie as a feminist raged behind him. A Facebook group called ‚ÄúMake America Great ‚Äì Trump 2020‚Äù posted a photoshopped job of the famous photo with Biden leaning in close to the feminist.
PolitiFact, being the crack team of truth-seekers they are, immediately launched into action and deemed the photo as a ‚Äúpants-0n-fire‚Äù level lie ."
Trump taxes: Trump attorney wants Justice Department to review request for president's tax returns,trendgossipnow.com,Trend Gossip Now,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://trendgossipnow.com/trump-taxes-trump-attorney-wants-justice-department-to-review-request-for-presidents-tax-returns/,"0
The attorney representing President Trump in the battle over his tax returns says the IRS shouldn‚Äôt divulge anything to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal until Justice Department lawyers issue a formal legal opinion on the constitutionality of the matter.
Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, asked the IRS on Wednesday to give over six years‚Äô worth of Mr. Trump‚Äôs tax returns to the committee. But in a letter to Treasury Department General Counsel Brent McIntosh on Friday, Trump attorney Will Consovoy said he doubted the constitutionality of Neal‚Äôs request, and warned about the ‚Äúdangerous precedent‚Äù it could set.
But perhaps the most significant lines come in the final paragraph of the four-page letter, when Consovoy asked the IRS to let the Justice Department‚Äôs Office of Legal Counsel get involved.
‚ÄúFinally, given the unprecedented nature of Chairman Neal‚Äôs request, the IRS should refrain from divulging the requested information until it receives a formal legal opinion from the Justice Department‚Äôs Office of Legal Counsel,‚Äù Consovoy wrote in the letter, which was obtained by CBS News.
Consovoy argues in his letter that Neal‚Äôs request ‚Äúflouts‚Äù the ‚Äúfundamental constitutional constraints‚Äù protecting privacy and First Amendment rights. ‚ÄúWhile the committee has jurisdiction over taxes, it has no power to conduct its own examination of individual taxpayers,‚Äù Consovoy wrote.
‚ÄúEven if Ways and Means had a legitimate committee purpose for requesting the president‚Äôs tax return and return information, that purpose is not driving Chairman Neal‚Äôs request. His request is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speech,‚Äù Consovoy added.
Consovoy expressed further concerns about how granting such a request could pave the way for more such requests.
‚ÄúAs Secretary Mnuchin recently told Congress, he is ‚Äònot aware that there has ever been a request for an elected official‚Äôs tax returns.‚Äô For good reason. It would be a gross abuse of power for the majority party to use tax returns as a weapon to attack, harass, and intimidate their political opponents. Once this Pandora‚Äôs box is opened, the ensuing tit-for-tat will do lasting damage to our nation.‚Äù
Mr. Trump, asked about whether he will urge the Treasury Department not to comply with the request, said Neal will have to speak with both his lawyers and Attorney General William Barr.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôll speak to my lawyers. They‚Äôll speak to the attorney general,‚Äù Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday.
Cosovoy is also representing Mr. Trump in a separate emoluments case involving allegations that Mr. Trump is personally and illegally profiting from foreign entities. "

Good Trump Keeps Border Open While Bad Trump Threatens New Tariffs,www.captainkudzu.com,CaptainKudzu (noreply@blogger.com),04-05-2019,2019,4,http://www.captainkudzu.com/2019/04/good-trump-keeps-border-open-while-bad.html," Friday, April 5, 2019 Good Trump Keeps Border Open While Bad Trump Threatens New Tariffs Both Good Trump and Bad Trump were on display yesterday as President Trump backed off from his threat to close the Mexican border and simultaneously threatened to add more tariffs to Mexican auto exports to the US. The threat to close the border had sparked fears of a disruption in trade with Mexico that could have led to shortages and price increases on numerous products including avocados. Addressing reporters at the White House, President Trump said that Mexico was not doing enough to stop cross-border traffic of illegal immigrants and drugs, but that he would give the Mexican government a year to improve. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to give them a one-year warning and if the drugs don‚Äôt stop, or largely stop, we‚Äôre going to put tariffs,‚Äù on cars, Trump said . ‚ÄúAnd if that doesn‚Äôt stop the drugs, we close the border.‚Äù When asked if his comments meant that he would not close the border for a year, Mr. Trump answered, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say that. We‚Äôll start with the tariffs and see what happens.‚Äù The president did not explain how what he has described as a national emergency at the border could withstand waiting a year to take action. Trump‚Äôs reversal on the threat to close the border was a welcome sign for businesses and economists. After decades of free trade under NAFTA, Mexico ranked as the second-largest export market for American-made goods as well as the second-largest supplier of imported goods to the US per the US Trade Representative . Many corporate supply chains are integrated within both countries with Mexican factories building components for products finished in the United States. Many consumer goods are also imported from Mexico. Since the president made his threat to close the border, the avocado has become symbolic of the trade with Mexico that would be lost if Mr. Trump follows through. The fruit used in guacamole has become a very popular food in the United States and most of the American supply is imported from Mexico. Some supporters of the president‚Äôs strategy argue that avocados are also grown in the US and so the market would not be disrupted if the border was closed. Several US states do grow avocados. The US produced a total of 292 million pounds of avocados in 2017. Unfortunately for avocado aficionados , Americans consumed about 2.2 billion (with a ‚Äúb‚Äù) pounds of avocados the same year. If avocado imports were cut off from Mexico, the world‚Äôs largest producer. The avocado deficit means that the US would certainly suffer a large avocado shortage if supplies from Mexico were cut off. When a product with high demand is in short supply, the laws of supply and demand take over. Prices increase and demand simultaneously falls. This has already happened as avocado markets reacted to the threat of border closure by increasing avocado prices by 34 percent . The problem is the same for many other products as for avocados. Cars are one example. Mexico exports more than 2.5 million autos to the US that are produced by almost all major automakers, including popular Ford, Chrysler, and GM models. The application of tariffs or the closure of the border could hit American automakers and consumers hard. It would take years to move production back to the US. Increasing prices would make it more attractive for American farmers to grow avocados, but the loss of avocado supplies could not be immediately replaced. As with moving a factory, it takes 3-4 years for newly planted avocado trees to produce fruit. Diverting American farmland to avocado production would also mean that other crops could not be planted, causing shortages of other commodities due to limited resources. The resources of the Mexican government are also limited. Security forces in the third-world country face a much greater threat from drug cartels than from migrants seeking to make their way to the US border. If the Mexican government gives in to President Trump‚Äôs demand to allocate more resources to intercepting and detaining migrants, those resources won‚Äôt be battling the cartels and drug smugglers. While the decision to keep the border open will be welcomed by many Republicans and members of the business community , the president‚Äôs threat to step up the tariff war is more problematic. The Trump Administration completed a NAFTA rewrite with Mexico and Canada last year, but the new treaty has yet to be ratified by each country. It is possible that Mexico will refuse to ratify the deal if President Trump continues to threaten new tariffs. Killing the new version of NAFTA may suit President Trump just fine. Mr. Trump blamed NAFTA for US economic woes on the campaign trail in 2016. As recently as December, the president threatened to withdraw from NAFTA entirely. Killing the free trade agreement would allow both countries to place tariffs on US goods and could cause an economic shock. President Trump‚Äôs erratic trade policies put the growth of the US economy at risk and work at odds with his regulatory and tax reform. Economic growth surged in the first half of 2018 following the passage of tax reform but slowed to Obama-era levels after the onset of Mr. Trump‚Äôs trade war. Growth for the fourth quarter of 2018 was recently revised downward to 2.2 percent, which is below the post-WWII average. President Trump deserves credit for reversing his decision to close the border, but the reversal merely corrects a self-induced problem that stems from the president‚Äôs rash and ill-considered comments of a week earlier. Closing the border would be unlikely to have a significant effect on slowing smuggling and illegal immigration, especially since most new illegals enter the US legally and overstay visas , but it would have a punishing effect on trade and the economy. If President Trump stands by his threat to close the borde next year, the debate would shift to the runup to the 2020 elections. The issue of a disruption of trade with Mexico could prove to be enough that many business leaders would see the socialist Democrats as less of a threat to the economy than an isolationist Trump Administration.

Transition In Algeria: More Than What Meets The Eye ‚Äì OpEd ‚Äì Eurasia Review,www.eurasiareview.com,Dr. Theodore Karasik,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.eurasiareview.com/06042019-transition-in-algeria-more-than-what-meets-the-eye-oped/,"By Dr. Theodore Karasik
With frail President Abdelaziz Bouteflika stepping down and apologizing to the nation, Algeria is entering a new phase in which many observers see a revival of the Arab Spring. However, Algerians are too sophisticated to experience an Arab Spring as others seem to want. That type of event is highly unlikely given the country‚Äôs history.
Unlike the Arab Spring, this transfer of power is a controlled transition to a hopefully better society. Any transfer of power is wrought with intense infighting over power and assets, but once that is worked out ‚Äî and in Algeria‚Äôs case it will be peaceful‚Äî a process will begin to elect a new leader given the country‚Äôs unique sociopolitical landscape.
This landscape has been shaped by history. Make no mistake, the events of the past weeks have been extraordinary and necessary. What is remarkable is that so far this transfer has been vocal and peaceful. Surely this is better than chaos, which no interested party, including Russia, wants.
At a basic level, Algeria‚Äôs street demonstrations need to be viewed in the context of the country‚Äôs recent history. Any comparisons with the 1988 Black October riots are tenuous. At the time Algeria was a disjointed civil society with a polarized elite that was able to play one political faction off against another. In addition, there were lingering memories of the Algerian war of independence. Studies that focus on post-war environments look at the role historical memory plays in shaping future relations. That factor is a special case in Algeria.
Algerians are wary of the Arab Spring and its unknown ramifications, especially with the still vivid legacy of civil strife and bloodshed of the 1990s. The country‚Äôs neighbors are watching its transition carefully given the events in Libya and in the wake of the Arab Summit in Tunisia.
To be clear, Algerians fear and loathe the current government, but Bouteflika‚Äôs stepping down in such an undignified matter means a feared Libyan or Syrian-style implosion can be avoided.
Algeria‚Äôs Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia warned that rioting or civil disturbances might result in a ‚ÄúSyrian-style environment‚Äù because of the country‚Äôs religious and political landscape. Ahmed Gaid Saleh, the army chief of staff, said that ‚Äúinternal and foreign‚Äù elements will seek to infiltrate demonstrations and destabilize the country. This is not propaganda. Al-Qaeda or Daesh-related groups and gangs will be drawn to protests in the country, threatening safety and security.
From an outside perspective, Algeria‚Äôs transition is being watched carefully. As the transition continues, Algiers must remain a key ally with the West in the fight against global terrorism, organized crime and illegal immigration to Europe. The situation in northern Mali has made cooperation between France and the Algerian security services even more critical. Such cooperation cannot be threatened given current events in countries ranging from Morocco to Egypt.
Russia is also taking a strong interest in what happens next in Algeria. History matters here, too. Soviet policy toward Algeria was viewed through the lens of Cold War rivalry over former French colonies. Across northern Africa, the Soviet Union used support for revolutionary and popular movements, arms sales and sports as its main tools of trade. Soviet support for the western Sahara led to complications in its bilateral relations with Morocco, with which the USSR had extensive trade relations. Bouteflika‚Äôs rise occurred during the Soviet Union‚Äôs collapse and thus a break between the two countries occurred. These relations set the stage for Russia‚Äôs return to Algeria in the 2000s.
In March 2006, Russian leader Vladimir Putin visited Algeria, two years before his double visit to the Arabian Gulf. At the time, Russia signed major arms agreements with Algeria as well as a settlement of Algeria‚Äôs debt to the Soviet Union, leading to a closer relationship between the two countries. Debt relief was also used in Syria to ensure future deals and concessions.
Algerian state oil company Sonatrach‚Äôs agreement with Russia‚Äôs Lukoil sent shock waves through Europe over the potential for both countries to act together to squeeze European energy supplies. Russia‚Äôs interest is in maintaining current contracts. Watching Sonatrach is important because of the state company‚Äôs concessions in Libya, Mauritania, Peru, Yemen and Venezuela. A recent deal with India is part of a wider geopolitical picture involving Arabian Peninsula downstream operations.
Russia‚Äôs activity shows that Moscow‚Äôs interest in North Africa is based on older Soviet ties and objectives with a modern twist. Russia sees the current transition as one that could challenge but also benefit the Kremlin. Algeria‚Äôs ties to key Arab countries will help Algerian elites work through what happens next to the country.
Clearly, the past few weeks show that the moniker of Arab Spring is too simple for the Algerian transition. Sophisticated protests and transitional leadership are critical for the country and its international partners at a time of heightened uncertainty across northern Africa. Those who shout Arab Spring are actually bringing trouble.

It looks good. But the NFL is too PC and anti Military Veteran today. I do not watch the NFL. The days of the Jets and Joe Namath were really fun to watch.

People need to be made accountable of their actions. That is what is needed most in America today.
