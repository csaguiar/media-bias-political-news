"Sunnyvalle Car-Ramming Suspect Is Iraq Vet With PTSD, Brother Says",www.thedailybeast.com,Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau),04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/isaiah-peoples-sunnyvale-car-ramming-suspect-is-iraq-vet-with-ptsd-brother-says,"‘I LOVE YOU, JESUS’ Sunnyvalle Car-Ramming Suspect Is Iraq Vet With PTSD, Brother Says Before Isaiah Peoples allegedly veered his car into the pack of Silicon Valley pedestrians, his family said the former Army gunner had numerous troubling ‘episodes.’ 04.25.19 8:39 AM ET Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety
The man who allegedly intentionally drove his speeding Toyota Corolla into a group of Silicon Valley pedestrians, injuring eight, has been identified by a family member as a troubled Iraqi war veteran with a history of suspected post-traumatic stress disorder.
Isaiah Joel Peoples, a 34-year-old government-contract auditor, has been charged with eight counts of attempted murder, The Mercury News reports.
Peoples’ brother told the Bay Area News Group that while Isaiah suffered from bouts of depression, he had not previously been known to be violent. The men’s mother said she had sensed something was wrong the afternoon before the veteran drove his car into the pedestrians, seriously injuring a 13-year-old girl.
“She said the way he was sounding, he was about to have another one of those episodes,” Joshua Peoples told the paper. “He was worried about his job; he wasn’t going to do accounting anymore.”
Peoples was a U.S. Army gunner in Iraq, according to his brother. “He was a gunner when they were driving,” he said, according to local news reports. “Every time he would call us, he was doing security for a post.”
Peoples spent time in mental-health treatment and was on medication, according to his brother. He was once hospitalized after “thinking the government was bugging his house.”
“Sometimes he’d be getting, like, overly religious going through those episodes,” Peoples’ brother said. “One time, when he was going through his PTSD, they said he was saying, ‘I rebuke you, Satan! Get out of here, Satan!’”
A witness to the Sunnyvale crash said Peoples stumbled out of his car after the attack and began ranting, saying “I love you, Jesus.”
It is not immediately known if Peoples was formally diagnosed with PTSD.
“When he got back, I didn’t really notice too much of a change, but there were things my mom and sister told me about that they saw him going through,” his brother said. “They told me he had PTSD.”"
"U.S.-Led Coalition Killed 1,600 Civilians in Raqqa: Amnesty International",www.thedailybeast.com,Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau),04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/raqqa-us-led-coalition-killed-1600-civilians-in-isis-held-town-amnesty-international-says,"EXCESSIVE FORCE U.S.-Led Coalition Killed 1,600 Civilians in Raqqa: Amnesty International An interactive website created by Amnesty and Airwars claims it has documented the deaths of 1,600 civilians in Syria at the hands of U.S.-led forces. 04.25.19 8:03 AM ET Amnesty International/Airwars
An interactive website developed by Amnesty International and Airwars is aiming to prove that U.S.-led forces in Syria killed 1,600 civilians in Raqqa . The U.S. military denies those claims.
The site, called Rhetoric Versus Reality: How the Most Precise Air Campaign in History Left Raqqa The Most Destroyed City in Modern Times , includes photos and stories from more than 500 people who have direct knowledge of the alleged atrocities.
The two groups say they spent two years investigating stories and contend that more than 1,600 civilians were killed as collateral damage in airstrikes by the U.S., U.K., and France, meant to destroy the so-called Islamic State terror group between June and October 2017 .
“Thousands of civilians were killed or injured in the U.S.-led coalition’s offensive to rid Raqqa of IS, whose snipers and mines had turned the city into a death trap,” Donatella Rovera, senior crisis response adviser at Amnesty, said ahead of the site launch Thursday morning. “Many of the air bombardments were inaccurate and tens of thousands of artillery strikes were indiscriminate, so it is no surprise they killed and injured many hundreds of civilians.”
Amnesty International and Airwars are hoping the purported proof offered on the website will prompt the U.S. military to “end their denial” over the heavy loss of life.
“Coalition forces razed Raqqa, but they cannot erase the truth,” the groups say. “Amnesty International and Airwars call upon the coalition forces to end their denial about the shocking scale of civilian deaths and destruction caused by their offensive in Raqqa.”
The group says it visited Raqqa during and after the battle and “collated and cross-referenced multiple data streams” for this investigation. “Researchers spent a total of around two months on the ground in Raqqa, carrying out site investigations at more than 200 strike locations and interviewing more than 400 witnesses and survivors.”
They also implemented Amnesty’s “Strike Trackers” initiative that identified the 11,000 destroyed buildings in Raqqa.
Using the input from 3,000 digital activists in 124 countries, the group was able to analyze two million satellite-image frames to pinpoint where the civilians were when they were killed. “The organization’s Digital Verification Corps, based at six universities around the world, analyzed and authenticated video footage captured during the battle.”
The end result is a database that includes information, including the locations where they were killed, of the 1,600 civilians who reportedly died in the U.S.-led coalition strikes. They have given names to 1,000 of the victims and verified 641 on the ground.
The U.S.-led coalition has admitted responsibility for killing 159 civilians— around 10 percent of the total number reported—but it has routinely dismissed the remainder as “non-credible,” the organizers say.
Airwars Director Chris Woods says the groups are calling upon the coalition forces to “fully investigate what went wrong at Raqqa and learn from those lessons, to prevent inflicting such tremendous suffering on civilians caught in future military operations.”"
For Putin and Kim Jong Un The Vladivostok Meeting Was the Message,www.thedailybeast.com,Donald Kirk,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/for-vladimir-putin-and-kim-jong-un-the-vladivostok-meeting-was-the-message,"NO NUKE NEWS For Putin and Kim Jong Un, the Vladivostok Meeting Was the Message It wasn’t the warmest encounter conceivable, but it sure went better than the Trump-Kim fiasco in Hanoi. 04.25.19 7:53 AM ET Alexander Zemlianichenko/Pool via REUTERS
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has at last played the Russian card, meeting President Vladimir Putin for their first summit. But he’s still holding it close to his chest.
Yes, Kim appeared to have gotten along better with Putin in Vladivostok than he did with President Donald Trump in Hanoi, where the summit meltdown seems to have cost a top North Korean diplomat his job and is rumored to have cost four lesser envoys their lives. “Putin would like to play a bigger role in the far east, notably the Korean peninsula, in competition with China as well as the United States.”
After Kim arrived by train (in a scene CNN’s Jeanne Moos likened to a Mussolini-Hitler summit parodied by Charlie Chaplin in The Great Dictator ) Putin and Kim talked for an uninterrupted two hours at a university. They then appeared in front of the press to recite opaque and most likely pre-scripted diplospeak.
No, they did not emerge with a joint communique affirming whatever they said about the two most pressing issues—denuclearization and sanctions. If Trump was looking for his buddy Putin to deliver something on those issues, it would seem he’ll be disappointed.
There was no indication that Putin got anywhere in persuading Kim to get rid of his nukes and missiles, and there was no sign that Putin would join Kim in trying to persuade the United Nations Security Council to drop the sanctions imposed with the unanimous approval of its five permanent members, including Russia and China, after the North’s nuclear and missile tests in late 2017.
Instead, all that Putin would say was that he and Kim had talked over “what should be done to improve the situation,” and Kim said they had had “a very fruitful exchange” about ways to achieve “a peaceful settlement.”
Just what was meant by “peaceful settlement” was left vague, although Kim presumably told Putin about his desire for a “peace treaty” formally ending the Korean War. Kim would not have been able to press that idea too far, however, since the former Soviet Union was not a signatory to the armistice signed at the truce village of Panmunjom in July 1953, even though the Kremlin had supplied planes, tanks, and artillery to North Korean forces.
The fact that the two finally met was definitely a sign, however, that Putin would like to play a bigger role in the Far East, notably the Korean Peninsula, in competition with China as well as the United States.
Putin left no doubt of his vision of a place for Russia at the table, any table, telling Tass, the Russian news agency, that he was “confident” that “international guarantees” for North Korea would “be necessary.” He even suggested a return to dormant six-party talks, including China, the U.S., Japan, Russia, and the two Koreas, saying they might help “in developing a system of international security guarantees” needed by the North.
And why not, he suggested, come up with an aid program—something Trump has made much of, too? “If these projects and similar ones were implemented,” he was quoted as saying, “this would create the necessary conditions for building the trust that’s so necessary for solving the key issues.”
In fact, the conversation may also have gotten down to one of Russia’s longstanding dreams—a railroad running up the Korean Peninsula, from South Korea through North Korea and then on to Siberia for carrying freight to Europe.
As Yuriy Krupnov, Moscow-based analyst at the Institute of Demography, Migration and Regional Development, told The Daily Beast. “We have built railroads and developed the port on the Sea of Japan for a big economic breakthrough in our cooperation with China. North Korean ports play a big role in this business plan; Trump should pay attention—this tango could be danced by all three of us, Russia, China, and United States.”
Clearly, the summit was intrinsic in Putin’s attempt to reassert Russian influence over North Korea, which Soviet forces ruled in the immediate aftermath of the Korean War as part of a deal with the U.S. dividing the peninsula between North and South at the 38th parallel.
The Soviet Union, under dictator Joseph Stalin, was responsible for bringing Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, to North Korea aboard a Soviet merchant vessel and installing him as leader of a caretaker government. Kim Il Sung had sat out World War II as a captain in the Soviet army, living near the far eastern city of Khabarovsk, but he had no responsibilities. It was while he was there that Kim Jong Un’s father, Kim Jong Il, was born, though North Korean propaganda maintains the mythology that Jong Il was born on the slopes of the sacred Mount Paektu on the Chinese border.
Kim Jong Un is assumed to have pleaded with Putin for breaks in trade and aid, which Moscow provided for almost nothing before the end of communist rule and the breakup of the Soviet Union nearly 30 years ago. North Korea, suffering under sanctions and crop failures, desperately needs oil and gas, which the Soviet Union used to ship into North Korea in return for virtually useless North Korean currency. In 1990, Moscow began demanding payment in real money—full value.
Kim Jong Un journeyed to Vladivostok by train right after getting rid of the man who had most to do with preparing his two summits with Trump. Kim Yong Chol , vice chairman of the Workers’ Party, of which Kim is chairman, was replaced as head of the United Front Department, responsible for dealings with the U.S. He had met Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on several occasions, including a visit to the U.S. during which he met Trump in Washington.
Presumably, however, Kim Jong Un saw Kim Yong Chol as responsible for the failure of his summit with Trump at the end of February. That meeting ended with Trump declaring his abiding friendship with Kim Jong Un, but demanding that Kim reveal where North Korea has all its nuclear facilities and agreeing to complete denuclearization.
Kim Yong Chol was not in the North Korean delegation to Vladivostok – a clear sign that he’d been sidelined, if not disciplined, for failing to let his boss know that Trump was serious about his demands and would probably agree to nothing less. Kim Jong Un obviously was caught by surprise by Trump’s walkout.
There was even a report by a small Japanese news and photo agency, Asia Press , that four members of the North Korean foreign ministry had been executed for their role in the Hanoi summit. According to the report, the four were accused of having accepted bribes in return for information provided to the Americans in the run-up to the summit. The report said military as well as civilian officials had witnessed the executions by firing squad, but there was no verification.
For Kim Jong Un’s summit with Putin, there was no advance build-up or prediction of results, just that the two would meet and review all the sensitive issues. Viewed that way, the summit was still a breakthrough considering that Russia had appeared as a minor player while Kim met China’s President Xi Jinping four times, amid much pomp and circumstance, in Beijing.
Basically, Kim was following in the footsteps of his father, who had met Putin in Moscow in 2001 and 10 years later conferred with Dmitry Medvedev, the Putin sidekick who was then filling in as president. Both Kims, father and son, traveled to Russia by train, as indeed Kim Jong Un had done when he went to Hanoi to meet Trump.
Putin had a military honor guard greet Kim on his arrival in Vladivostok, matching the welcome accorded Kim by the Chinese, a sign of a budding new relationship grafted onto the historic ties of the Soviet era.

Well, it wasn’t the smoothest launch from Joe Biden, was it? First it was Wednesday, and three speeches. Then it was Thursday. But still a speech, or so I thought. Then it was just a video.
Although, inevitably, he’s doing a fundraiser, too. And now it’s Pittsburgh next Monday, with the official unveiling apparently put off until May 18, in Philadelphia. Kinda weird, like Sly Stone’s concert schedule in the ’70s.
But, we do have this video…
…and it’s actually pretty good.
He could have started this video in a thousand different ways. The obvious thing, of course, would have been Scranton. His hometown, which codes Pennsylvania working class like few other places, has the benefit of making some people smile as they think of the Dunder-Mifflin gang. Plenty of upsides there.
So it was interesting that he chose Charlottesville. He started with Thomas Jefferson and the Declaration of Independence. Then the music changed to a minor key, and he upshifted to what happened in Charlottesville in 2017. Stark images of Nazi flags and marching thugs carrying torches. Reference to “Europe in the 1930s.” Reference to Donald Trump’s “very fine people”—words, he said, that “stunned the world.”
“With those words, the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it,” Biden said. “And in that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I’d seen in my lifetime.”
With four more years in the White House, he continues, Trump “will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation.” Then, some old black-and-white footage: the Statue of Liberty, suffragists, D-Day, Iwo Jima, civil rights marchers. Finally, a long-ish paean to America and “who we are.”
Well written, well delivered. Charlottesville is Biden’s bid to get the attention of some younger voters, while the video’s second half is aimed squarely at his base, the kinds of Democrats whose blood still stirs at the sight of men storming Utah Beach.
By the way, those Democrats still exist, in very large numbers. This is one proposition Biden’s candidacy will put to the test—whether the center of gravity in the Democratic Party today has shifted irrevocably to the younger and leftier crowd one encounters on social media.
In December, Gallup asked Democrats whether on the whole they’d rather see their party become more liberal or more moderate. More moderate won, and pretty convincingly: 54 to 41 percent. By the way, Gallup asked Republicans that question too, about their party, except of course “more conservative” instead of “more liberal.” Shockingly (not), Republicans said more conservative by 57-37 (can you imagine? More conservative than this!).
Also according to Gallup , about half of Democrats say they’re liberal. On the one hand, that’s a recent historic high. But on the other, it means that about half don’t. About a third say moderate, which leaves around 15 percent who actually call themselves conservative.
That’s the Democratic Party. You’d never know it from the media, which is drawn to the left-wing storyline like cocaine. But most Democrats are middle-age—and older—people, most of them women, of all races, who’d call themselves liberal to moderate. Those are the people who usually decide who the Democratic nominee will be.
This is Biden’s theoretical crowd, but I think he has trouble even with them. Since they are predominantly women, and on the older side, they’ll remember the Anita Hill hearings, along with his two previous and spectacularly bad presidential runs and his penchant for awkward malapropisms and all the rest.
In my anecdotal experience, this group doesn’t love Biden. White union men do, and as nominee he would win enough them back in the key states, I think there’s not much doubt about that. But they make up a smaller portion of the party’s base with each election. As for other older Democrats, there’s a lot about Biden they don’t especially like. But they probably are open to being persuaded that he can win. And that he can stop Bernie Sanders, whom they don’t like as a general rule, and that he can beat Trump.
So that’s the first sale Biden will have to make: I can win.
The second sale he needs to make is to those younger and leftier voters. There are enough of them that he can’t ignore them. They’re never going to love him. They’re with Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O’Rourke. But Biden can make himself vaguely acceptable to them.
He could do this in two ways. First, some blunt apologies about some of his past positions. He can’t just excuse himself away by saying it was a different time. He has to explain his old thinking and explain his current thinking in a way that convinces people that maybe this old dog has learned some new tricks.
The other way is to talk about class in a much sharper manner than he’s ever done. He should not come out for Medicare for All and free college and the current version of the Green New Deal. That will look phony.
But he absolutely should say that today’s capitalism is not the capitalism he grew up with. In other words, it’s not enough today to talk in the usual chicken-soup way about restoring the American dream. For a lot of people, especially young people, the American dream is a nightmare. He needs to show that he understands that this isn’t just a temporary bad turn, but that we’re entering the fourth decade of a political-economic epoch that has stolen trillions of dollars from working people and given it to the rich. And he ought to name a few names. Identify some bad guys. Not easy for an establishment guy to do, especially one who represented the corporate headquarters state for umpty-ump years.
Democratic voters want electability. If Biden can make those two sales, he’ll have a shot. There’s not a lot in his track record that suggests that he can, but maybe the extraordinary nature of the historical moment will make him reach deeper into himself than he ever has. He’ll need to.

‘Fox & Friends’ on Joe Biden Announcement Video: It Might Actually Be a Winning Message,www.thedailybeast.com,olivia.messer@thedailybeast.com (Olivia Messer),04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-and-friends-on-joe-biden-launch-video-it-might-actually-be-a-winning-message,"UH OH ‘Fox & Friends’ on Joe Biden Announcement Video: It Might Actually Be a Winning Message The ex-VP’s unexpectedly fierce announcement caught the ‘Fox & Friends’ off-guard, with the hosts seemingly stung by his attack on their biggest fan. 04.25.19 9:23 AM ET Fox News
Minutes after Joe Biden announced his candidacy for the 2020 presidential nomination, Fox & Friends glumly assessed that the Democratic frontrunner’s strategy “might actually be a winning message.”
Co-host Ainsley Earhardt contrasted Biden’s stinging announcement video—a fierce attack on Fox & Friends fan President Trump and his shameful comments after the deadly Charlotteville neo-Nazi protests—with the blowback Sen. Bernie Sanders received Wednesday night at the She the People presidential forum in Houston. When the Vermont senator was asked at the event about the rise of white nationalism in America, he defaulted to his usual talking points about immigration reform and mentioned his attendance at the March on Washington with Dr. Martin Luther King. The audience booed him and someone yelled “we know!”
“There were moans and groans because they say he was dodging the question,” Earhardt said Thursday morning.
“When you see Joe Biden making that plea, just anti-racism, anti-white supremacy, it might actually be a winning message.”
Earhardt did, however, lament that Biden’s announcement video “aggressively” attacked Trump for his post-Charlottesville violence comments.
“If we give Donald Trump eight will nation,” Biden said in his announcement video. “And I cannot stand by and watch that happen.”
“We saw Klansmen and white supremacists and neo-Nazis come out in the open. Their crazed faces illuminated by torches, veins bulging and baring the fangs of racism, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the ’30s,” he added.
“That’s when we heard the words of that stunned the world and shocked the conscience of this nation,” continued Biden. “He said there were quote some ‘very fine people on both sides.’ Very fine people on both sides?”
The folks on the Fox & Friends couch weren’t fans of Biden’s harsh tone.
“I was thinking when he announced it was going to be cheerful music, and pomp and circumstance, and proud to be an American and American flags. It was a different tone,” Earhardt said.
Guest co-host Ed Henry added: “Usually you get in and want to reflect that optimistic tone and tell us—tell the American people what is your vision for America.”
“I got it that there’s a resist movement in this country that wants to take out Donald Trump over everything basically, especially something like Charlottesville,” Henry continued. “If you think that’s a moment that you want to highlight, it seems to me that could be part of the video. But it seems it turned out to be a dominant part of the video, and the music is somber. It’s very downbeat, downcast, tear the president down. And less about what you would do differently.”"

‘Time’ Magazine’s Digital Staff Demands to Join the Union,www.thedailybeast.com,Maxwell.Tani@thedailybeast.com (Maxwell Tani),04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/time-magazines-digital-staff-demands-to-join-the-union,"ABOUT TIME ‘Time’ Magazine’s Digital Staff Demands to Join the Union Publication’s digital staff say it’s unfair for the company to only allow print staffers to join its editorial union. exclusive Eric Baradat/Getty
Time magazine’s digital staffers are seeking to unionize, breaking down a barrier at the organization between print and digital wings of the publication.
The iconic magazine’s print employees have been unionized for 80 years through the NewsGuild , which also represents a number of major news outlets including The Daily Beast.
But the union’s contract has not covered staffers designated by the company as primarily digital focused. In a statement provided to The Daily Beast, Time magazine digital staff said only employees who prove they spend 30% of their time working on print are currently allowed to join the Time magazine union.
But like many newsrooms that still have a print magazine or newspaper, employees often work on both print and digital.
On Thursday, staff told the magazine’s management that they were seeking to join the company’s print union, noting that digital staff often work on major packages like the Time 100.
“It's great to work at Time and we’re excited to see what the future of Time will look like, but Time’ s digital employees play a really big role in its success as a news outlet, and that’s only going to continue in the future,” Time digital reporter Cady Lang told The Daily Beast. “We’re asking to be respected with the same kinds of protections as our print colleagues.”
Time ’s digital staffers would join a wave of newsrooms that have unionized in the past several years amid layoffs and tumult in the media industry. BuzzFeed News , Vox Media , and The New Yorker have all formed unions over the past two years, seeking greater newsroom diversity, standard pay, and stronger severance agreements.
Time ’s digital employees mentioned many of the same goals in their statement Thursday. They noted that print employees had greater protections from being fired, as well as guaranteed annual cost-of-living raises. The staff also said they were paid “significantly less than the market value of our work.”
“For years, Time has operated as a two-tier system, whereby the print staff has the protection of our Collective Bargaining Agreement and the digital staff does not,” Time reporter Leslie Dickstein said. “This is an artificial and outdated divide. We believe every worker at Time deserves the benefits and protections of a union contract.”
The unionization effort presents a potential test for the magazine’s management and new owners.
Late last year, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff and his wife, Lynne, purchased the magazine. The billionaire tech mogul has positioned himself as an example of a progressive corporate leader who promotes positive social values in the workplace, including advocating for gender pay equity and nonprofit work.
In their statement Thursday, staffers said they were excited by the new owners and their vision for the publication’s future, and noted Benioff’s public comments supporting strong worker benefits and protections.
“Marc and Lynne Benioff want us to create a Time that lives by its values and walks its talk,” the statement said. “One of those values, according to Edward, is that our people are our most important asset. We agree. And that’s why we hope management will voluntarily recognize our union—and in turn, recognize that all of our people are essential to the success of this 96-year-old institution.”
In a statement, a Time spokesperson said the company would discuss the staffers' proposal with the News Guild.
""Since the formation of our new company in November, Time has worked hard to build a strong relationship with the News Guild, to provide our employees with new enhanced benefits and to build a vibrant and collaborative culture. We look forward to these further discussions with the guild."""

Symone Sanders, who rose to prominence as Sen. Bernie Sanders ’ (I-VT) national press secretary during his 2016 presidential campaign, has signed on to work for former Vice President Joe Biden ’s 2020 bid. She will serve as a senior advisor.
Sanders, who had been uncommitted throughout the cycle, is a CNN political commentator and has worked with Priorities USA, the largest Democratic Party Super PAC. She was a major hire for Sanders during the 2016 campaign, coming just as he faced criticism over the lack of diversity on his staff. But in the summer of 2016, she quit the campaign, at the time saying she did so of her own volition.
Sanders is a prominent progressive voice and a regular presence on cable news, giving Biden a valuable addition to his team. But she hasn’t always been sympatico with the former vice president. Recently, Sanders chastised Biden for cracking jokes in response to the unwanted touching allegations leveled against him by several women with whom he’d interacted during his career.
In the segment, she raised a hypothetical about how she would handle communications for Biden.
“If I’m Vice President Biden’s communications person, if he comes out and says the words ‘I’m sorry,’ all the chyrons and headlines will say ‘I’m sorry,’ Sanders said encouraging Biden to keep listening and talking to people.
Prior to then Sanders had also characterized the conventional wisdom around Biden being the frontrunner in the Democratic primary as being “overhyped.” In the same report though, she acknowledged that he could be “formidable.”
The Biden campaign did not return a request for comment but Sanders confirmed to The Daily Beast in a text message on Thursday.
Sanders was later featured among the staff hires announced by the Biden campaign on Thursday.
“We are incredibly proud of the diverse and talented team that has come together behind this campaign’s vision to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild the backbone of the country, and unify America,” said Greg Schultz, who will serve as campaign manager. “We know this is exactly the kind of change voters are looking for and we are excited to get to work to share Vice President Biden’s vision in every corner of the country.”"

Apparently, Adolf Hitler and Nazism are not the definitive worst thing to have happened to Germany—at least if you were to ask Lara Trump.
Appearing Thursday morning on Fox Business Network’s Varney and Co ., the presidential daughter-in-law and Trump 2020 campaign consultant and host Stuart Varney reacted to footage of Central American migrants—the “ mother of all caravans which is approaching our southern border,” as Varney described it.
The host declared that such footage reminded him of the millions of Syrian and Middle Eastern refugees that migrated to Europe a few years ago in search of refugee status, lamenting that German Chancellor Angela Merkel “ let them in .”
This prompted Trump to deliver her own take on Deutschland history.
“It was the downfall of Germany. It was one of the worst things to ever happen to Germany,” she said without a hint of irony.
“This president knows that. He’s trying to prevent that from happening here,” she added. “But Congress has got to get their act together and do the right thing for the American people.”
While economic forecasters have downgraded their current expectations for Germany—largely due to trade disputes with America and a messy Brexit deal in the United Kingdom—one would be hard-pressed to claim that slow growth represents the “downfall” of a country. Especially when that nation literally collapsed once because of the Third Reich.
But whatever."

Parkland mass shooter Nikolas Cruz is reportedly set to collect part of a $864,929 life insurance policy, making him ineligible to have defense attorneys from the Broward Public Defender’s Office. The Miami Herald reports that Cruz and his half-brother, Zachary Cruz, will share the proceeds of a MetLife life insurance policy. No further details were available on how much exactly Nikolas Cruz would get. Since the Defender’s Office can only defend “impoverished” clients, the office asked the court Wednesday to remove its lawyers from the case. “The defendant and... counsel were previously unaware of this entitlement,” Cruz's lawyers wrote in documents. “The Law Office of the Public Defender is statutorily prohibited from representing a non-indigent client.” While it is unclear whose life insurance is the source of Cruz's windfall, the shooter's adoptive mother died in November 2017. Cruz confessed to shooting up Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018, and he has since been indicted on 17 counts of first-degree murder and 17 attempted murder counts. A not-guilty plea was submitted on Cruz's behalf, and a judge is reportedly considering a 2020 sentencing date for the 20-year-old.

Judge Shelley Richmond Joseph Charged With Helping Undocumented Immigrant Evade ICE,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/judge-shelley-richmond-joseph-charged-with-helping-undocumented-immigrant-evade-ice,"VANISHED Judge Charged With Helping Undocumented Immigrant Escape Court to Dodge ICE Feds say Massachusetts judge and court officer turned off recording device and unlocked exit to let a man deported twice slip away from being detained. 04.25.19 2:19 PM ET Getty
A Massachusetts judge and a court officer were charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant wanted by ICE to slip out of court undetected, federal prosecutors announced on Thursday.
Middlesex County Judge Shelley Richmond Joseph and court officer Wesley MacGregor are accused of helping an undocumented immigrant last April escape Newton District Court while an ICE agent waited outside of Joseph’s courtroom to arrest him on a federal detainer.
“I’m not gonna allow them to come in here,”Joseph allegedly told the man’s defense attorney. Then MacGregor allegedly turned off the court’s recording device and used his security card to unlock a rear exit so the immigrant could leave. It was not clear what happened to the immigrant after he escaped.
Joseph and MacGregor were charged with three counts: conspiracy, aiding and abetting, and obstruction of a federal proceeding. MacGregor was additionally charged with perjury for allegedly lying to a grand jury when he said he wasn't aware an ICE officer was in the courthouse that day.
“This case is not about immigration. It is about the rule of law. We don’t get to pick and choose the federal laws that we follow,” U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said in a Thursday press conference announcing the charges.
The immigrant was not identified in the Thursday indictment, but has been previously identified as 38-year-old Jose Medina-Perez, a Dominican Republic national. On March 30, Medina-Perez was arrested by Newton Police and charged with narcotics possession and fleeing a drunk-driving warrant in Pennsylvania.
The indictment alleges he “had been previously deported from the United States by federal immigration officials in 2003 and again in 2007.” When his fingerprints were taken, ICE became aware of the arrest and issued an order for his detainment.
Joseph, a former prosecutor and defense attorney, was appointed by Gov. Charlie Baker in October 2017. The pair are expected to appear in court later Thursday."

Parents of A.J. Freund Forced 5-Year-Old in Cold Shower Before Fatal Beating: Prosecutors,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/aj-freund-case-parents-forced-5-year-old-in-cold-shower-before-fatal-beating-prosecutors-say,"IT GETS WORSE Parents of A.J. Freund Forced 5-Year-Old in Cold Shower Before Fatal Beating: Prosecutors Andrew ‘A.J.’ Freund’s parents were arrested and charged with murder hours after the toddler’s body was found wrapped in plastic in a shallow grave. 04.25.19 1:03 PM ET Scott Olson/Getty
Andrew “A.J.” Freund, the 5-year-old Illinois boy whose body was found Wednesday morning in the woods, was forced into a cold shower “for an extended period of time” before he was beaten “repeatedly” to death by his parents on April 15, prosecutors allege.
Nine days after his murder, the missing toddler’s body was found wrapped in plastic and buried in a shallow grave about seven miles away from his Crystal Lake home.
The toddler’s parents, 36-year-old JoAnn Cunningham and 60-year-old Andrew Freund Sr., were arrested and charged hours after the Wednesday discovery with first-degree murder, aggravated battery, domestic battery, and failure to report a missing child or child death. Freund Sr. was also charged with concealment of a death.
“It was apparent to me that nobody was going to sleep and nobody will sleep until justice is brought for AJ. This is the beginning of that process,” said FBI Agent Jeffrey Sallet at a Wednesday afternoon press conference.
The couple appeared at McHenry County Circuit Court on Thursday morning, wearing orange prison jumpsuits as Judge Robert A. Wilbrandt set their bond at $5 million each. Both were represented by public defenders, who did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s requests for comment.
Prosecutors allege in a criminal complaint that three days before the 5-year-old’s parents reported him missing, he was forced into the shower and then “struck” to death.
Local, state, and federal authorities launched a multi-county search for the little boy, finally finding his body after the couple was confronted with cell-phone evidence, Crystal Lake Police Chief Jim Black told The Daily Beast on Thursday. Search crews recovered the toddler’s body in the woods and technicians immediately removed evidence from the family’s home, including a child’s mattress and a shovel.
An official cause of death has not yet been determined, but A.J.’s autopsy is scheduled for Thursday afternoon, the McHenry County Coroner’s Office said.
“To A.J.’s family, it is my hope that you may have some solace knowing that A.J. is no longer suffering, and his killers have been brought to justice,” Black said Wednesday. “To A.J., we know you’re at peace playing in heaven’s playground, and are happy you no longer have to suffer.”
According to Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) records, A.J. was born in 2013 with “opiates in his system,” and was removed from his parents’ custody a month later. He was placed in foster care, records show, for two years before he was returned to Cunningham and Freund Sr. in June 2015.
Twice last year, DCFS caseworkers were called to the Freund home to investigate separate allegations of neglect, but both were “determined to be unfounded,” a spokesperson said Thursday.
In December, when police called the agency after Cunningham was arrested on a misdemeanor traffic charge, authorities documented “significant problems” with the couple’s “cluttered” and “dirty” home, including an “overwhelming” “smell of feces” in the toddlers’ bedroom, documents show.
Crystal Lake Police also confirmed officers visited the home, which is an hour outside of Chicago, about 10 times over the past five years, and often noted the poor condition of the house in their reports.
“This news is heartbreaking. Protecting vulnerable children who come to our attention is at the core of our mission at DCFS. All of us feel this loss,” Marc Smith, acting director of DCFS, said in a statement obtained by The Daily Beast. “Our priority is the care and safety of Andrew’s younger sibling.”
A DCFS spokesman confirmed Thursday that the couple’s younger son, 3-year-old Parker, has been placed in protective custody.
Cunningham and Freund are scheduled to appear in court on April 29."
Bernie Sanders First to Sign Pledge to Rally Behind Democratic Nominee,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-first-to-sign-pledge-to-rally-behind-whoever-wins-democratic-primary,"Bernie Sanders First to Sign Pledge to Rally Behind Democratic Nominee The pledge was launched this morning by Indivisible. 04.25.19 3:32 PM ET Loren Elliott
National progressive outfit Indivisible on Thursday launched a pledge compelling all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates to rally behind the eventual nominee. Bernie Sanders was the first to sign it, the group revealed.
The “We Are Indivisible” pledge asks for three commitments from him and any other prospective signers, as first reported by BuzzFeed News . First, Indivisible’s pledge requests that candidates “make the primary constructive” by outlining their visions while respecting their opponents.
“I’ll support the ultimate Democratic nominee, whoever it is—period,"" the pledge also reads. “No Monday morning quarterbacking. No third-party threats. Immediately after there’s a nominee, I’ll endorse.”
And the group also wants a commitment that every candidate will “do the work to beat Trump,” including a promise that “As soon as there is a nominee, I will put myself at the disposal of the campaign.”
“We believe in rigorous and spirited primaries, and we also know that once we have a nominee, our entire focus must turn to defeating Trump. The ‘We Are Indivisible’ Pledge commits all of us to a debate of ideas followed by dedicated work to make our ideas reality,” said Indivisible’s co-executive directors Leah Greenberg and Ezra Levin. “This pledge is about beating Donald Trump and the anti-democratic, xenophobic right wing. And it’s about the ideas and vision we need for a post-Trump future.”
Sanders has consistently pledged to run a positive campaign and to support any eventual nominee, even referring to some of the competitors in the race as friends. Even on Thursday, Sanders referred to the former Vice President Joe Biden—the latest and perhaps most formidable candidate to enter the race—as a friend with whom he has many disagreements.
However, Sanders has never been shy about criticizing more establishment-aligned elements of the Democratic Party. He recently sent a scathing letter to liberal think-tank Center for American Progress criticizing its corporate contributions and its content that was overtly critical of him for his wealth."

Newly announced presidential candidate Joe Biden contacted Anita Hill earlier this month to express “regret” over the way her sexual-assault allegations against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas were handled—but Hill didn’t walk away happy.
She told The New York Times this week that she was unsatisfied with their conversation and refuses to call what he said an apology.
“I cannot be satisfied by simply saying I’m sorry for what happened to you. I will be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose,” she said. Hill added that she doesn’t think Biden yet understands the true consequences of his actions, and, as such, she cannot support his presidential bid.
“The focus on apology to me is one thing,” Hill added. “But he needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public because we know now how deeply disappointed Americans around the country were about what they saw. And not just women. There are women there are women and men now who have just really lost confidence in our government to respond to the problem of gender violence.”
The former vice president, who was chair of the judiciary committee during Thomas’ hearing, has been criticized for how Hill was treated and for his decision to not call additional witnesses to support her testimony. The then-senator’s conduct during Thomas’ hearings is widely viewed as one of his greatest obstacles in connecting with the #MeToo era’s younger, more liberal wing of the Democratic Party.
In March, Biden said he regretted his actions , but stopped short of claiming responsibility.
“I wish I could’ve done something... To this day I regret I couldn’t give her the kind of hearing she deserved,” he said. “She paid a terrible price. She was abused during that hearing.” During his call with Hill, he reportedly “shared with her directly his regret for what she endured and his admiration for everything she has done to change the culture around sexual harassment in this country.”"

Anna Delvey Trial: Fake German Heiress Anna Sorokin Found Guilty,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/anna-delvey-trial-fake-german-heiress-anna-sorokin-found-guilty,"TIME TO FACE THE MUSIC Fake German Heiress Anna Sorokin Found Guilty in Fraud Trial The 28-year-old once spent $40,000 in eight days, just a fraction of the $275,000 prosecutors say the ‘SoHo grifter’ conned friends and family out of in a 10-month spree. 04.25.19 7:05 PM ET TIMOTHY A. CLARY
Anna Sorokin, the fake German heiress accused of swindling friends and businesses out of hundreds of thousands of dollars to bankroll her lavish Manhattan lifestyle, was found guilty on Thursday.
According to the New York Post , Sorokin was found guilty on eight counts— including first-degree attempted grand larceny. She reportedly faces 15 years behind bars and will be sentenced on May 9.
Known in New York’s social scene as Anna Delvey, Sorokin reinvented herself when she arrived in the United States from Germany in 2016, posing as a wealthy socialite when she was in fact the daughter of a Russian truck driver, prosecutors said.
After traveling the world and living in expensive boutique hotels, the 28-year-old was arrested in October 2017 and charged with grand larceny and theft of services for allegedly stealing about $275,000 in a 10-month spree.
During her three-week trial in Manhattan Supreme Court, Sorokin declined to take the stand on her behalf, and her attorney, Todd Spodek, didn’t put on a defense case.
The “SoHo grifter’s” case garnered national attention following New York Magazine and Vanity Fair articles last year that detailed the lengths Sorokin went through to convince close friends, banks, and financial institutions she was a foreign heiress with unlimited funds.
Manhattan prosecutors alleged Sorokin told “lie after lie” to maintain the lavish lifestyle she couldn’t afford, often providing forged financial records and bank statements to persuade others she had millions of euros overseas.
Sorokin, who told friends she’d moved to New York to start a private art club, lived out of hotels with an overdrawn account, dined at trendy restaurants without paying the tab, and even hired a personal trainer for $300 a session, prosecutors said.
“She knew if she told people she had this money, they would trust her, that eventually she would be good for the deal,” Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Catherine McCaw said in her closing arguments. “In fact, she had no ability to pay and no intention to pay.”
To prove Sorokin’s disregard for money, prosecutors detailed in court how she once spent $40,000 in just eight days. While staying at the W Hotel in Manhattan, she allegedly “barricaded herself” in her room and refused to let anyone inside, eventually spending $679 in miscellaneous expenses.
“That’s an awful lot of M&Ms,” McCaw said . “She knew she couldn’t pay for it.”
To fund her private art club, the 28-year-old allegedly created bogus bank statements while applying for a $22 million loan, creating a “team of imaginary assistants” in an effort to expand her credit line. Sorokin blamed this “team” when there were problems with wire transfers—at which point her plan begin to unravel, prosecutors said.
“All of the defendant’s wire transfers are merely a figment of her imagination,” McCaw said . “These are not white lies. These are lies that help you understand that the defendant, in fact, had criminal intent in this case.”
Prosecutors called more than two dozen witnesses to provide damning testimony against Sorokin, including Rachel Williams, a former friend whom she invited on a supposedly free trip to Morocco. Williams said she was forced to pay the $70,000 tab when Sorokin couldn’t cover the bill.
“I wish I had never met Anna. If I could go back in time and not be where I am today, you bet I would,” Williams, a former Vanity Fair photo editor and author of the 2018 article, said last week. “In hindsight, it’s easier to figure out the times where there were red flags. But at the time, I did not find it strange.”
The defense, however, argued that Sorokin was just living by the old adage “fake it till you make it,” like New York musician legend Frank Sinatra.
“Sinatra made a brand-new start of it in New York, just as Miss Sorokin did,” her lawyer, Todd Spodek, told jurors in court on Tuesday. She “was ambitious, she was persistent and she was determined to make her business a reality,” he said.
Admitting her lifestyle may have been “unethical and unorthodox,” Spodek insisted in his closing arguments that Sorokin was “enabled every step of the way by a system that favors people with money.” Though Sorokin did not speak, the trial was delayed several times over wardrobe concerns.
As previously reported by The Daily Beast , Sorokin hired former Glamour magazine editor Anastasia Walker to dress her for court appearances, a move her lawyer said was important since her style is a “driving force in her business, and life, and it is a part of who she is.” Her courtroom outfits have even inspired an Instagram account, Anna Delvey Court Looks , which has currently amassed over 3,000 followers.
“There’s a little bit of Anna in all of us,” Spodek concluded. “This is the life she chose to live.”"
Federal Judge Blocks Trump Administration Ban on Abortion Referrals,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/federal-judge-blocks-trump-administration-ban-on-abortion-referrals,"an hour ago Federal Judge Blocks Trump Administration Ban on Abortion Referrals
A federal judge in Washington issued a nationwide preliminary injunction Thursday temporarily blocking the Trump administration from banning abortion referrals at federally funded family planning clinics, The Hill reports. Judge Stanley Bastian blocked the planned changes to the Title X family planning program—which was scheduled to go into effect May 3—that would have barred federal funding to clinics that referred women to abortion providers. The changes also would lift a requirement for clinics to tell women about the abortion option, and would make clinics like Planned Parenthood ineligible for federal funding. The Trump administration will now have to wait for lawsuits against the Title X rule changes to go through the courts before implementing them. “Today’s decision is a victory for the 4 million patients nationwide who rely on trusted family planning providers for access to birth control and other essential health care,” ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project attorney Ruth E. Harlow said in a statement. “The Trump administration has made clear that they will stop at nothing to curtail access to contraception and other reproductive health services for low-income people. We will continue to fight for what is right every step of the way.” "
Facebook Under Investigation for Helping Itself to 1.5 Million Users’ Email Contact Lists,www.thedailybeast.com,Kevin.Poulsen@thedailybeast.com (Kevin Poulsen),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/facebook-under-investigation-by-new-york-ag-for-helping-itself-to-15-million-users-email-contact-lists,"‘BEYOND SKETCHY’ Facebook Under Investigation for Helping Itself to 1.5 Million Users’ Email Contact Lists New York Attorney General Letitia James blasted the social media giant for its ‘lack of respect’ for users when she announced the inquiry Tuesday. 04.25.19 8:38 PM ET Mandel Ngan/Getty
New York’s attorney general is investigating why Facebook helped itself to the email contact lists of 1.5 million people who gave the company their passwords as part of Facebook’s new account setup process.
“It is time Facebook is held accountable for how it handles consumers’ personal information,” said Attorney General Letitia James in a statement announcing the latest probe of Facebook’s privacy practices. “Facebook has repeatedly demonstrated a lack of respect for consumers’ information while at the same time profiting from mining that data.”
Early this month The Daily Beast reported that Facebook’s onboarding system was demanding some new users turn over the password for their email account, so the company could log in as the user and confirm it was really their address—a system one security expert called “beyond sketchy.”
The additional login step had been noticed by a cybersecurity watcher on Twitter called “e-sushi.” Within hours of The Daily Beast’s report, Facebook announced it was ending the practice . “We understand the password verification option isn’t the best way to go about this, so we are going to stop offering it,” the company wrote in a statement at the time.
Facebook explained the password demand as a misbegotten but well-intended feature meant to simplify sign-ups. But last week, Facebook confessed to Business Insider that it used the passwords for more than just email verification.
The company also “unintentionally” used the proffered password to slurp down the users’ address books without permission, grabbing an estimated 1.5 million contact lists from May 2016 to the day it ended the practice this month.
The harvesting was not done in secret. Facebook showed the user a progress bar as it ingested the names and email addresses of their friends, colleagues, and loved ones, but didn’t provide a way to stop the process.
According to the attorney general’s announcement, the purloined contact lists were used for “targeted marketing” and affected far more people than Facebook’s official numbers reflect.
“While Facebook has admitted that 1.5 million people’s contact books were directly harvested, the total number of people whose contact information was improperly obtained by Facebook may be hundreds of millions, as people can have hundreds of contacts stored on their contact databases,” the attorney general’s office said in its statement.
It’s not the first time Facebook has repurposed personal information handed over by users.
Last year Facebook was caught allowing advertisers to target its users using phone numbers users provided for two-factor authentication; users handed over their numbers so Facebook could send a text message with a secret code when they log in. More recently the company drew the ire of privacy advocates when it began making those phone numbers searchable , so anyone can locate the matching user “in defiance of user expectations and security best practices,” wrote the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group.
In a statement Thursday, a Facebook spokesperson said the company was cooperating in the new probe.
“We're in touch with the New York State attorney general’s office and are responding to their questions on this matter."""
‘Gonna Give Them Hell’: How Trump and His Lawyers Plotted for Months to Make Democrats Pay,www.thedailybeast.com,asawin.suebsaeng@thedailybeast.com (Asawin Suebsaeng),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/gonna-give-them-hell-how-trump-and-his-lawyers-plotted-for-months-to-make-democrats-pay,"ON BRAND ‘Gonna Give Them Hell’: How Trump and His Lawyers Plotted Revenge Fantasy Against the Democrats The president has a new legal plan to attack everything the Democrats try to do. So ‘get ready for a knockout, drag-out fight over everything.’ 04.25.19 8:34 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty
Three months before Robert Mueller’s report was even delivered to the Department of Justice, Donald Trump was already meeting with his lawyers about how to resist, combat, and impede the possible Democratic investigations that might arise from the special counsel’s findings.
In multiple conference calls and closed-door gatherings at the White House that have taken place since January, the president began mapping out, with both White House and outside counsel, how to handle the coming onslaught of congressional probes and subpoenas aimed at his administration, his family, and his business empire, according to three people with knowledge of the various conversations.
By February, Trump was actively asking those around him about the ways in which subpoenas from Democratic-controlled House committees could be fiercely challenged, a senior administration official said. By that time, those close to Trump say he had already settled, firmly, on a path forward.
President Trump’s opinion—an assessment reinforced by the advice of his lawyers and friends—was that he and his legal war council shouldn’t give an inch to congressional investigators and liberal lawmakers. He wanted his legal teams’ approach, out of the gate, to be far more ostentatiously aggressive than it had been during the two-year Trump-Russia saga .
By Easter weekend at his private Florida club Mar-a-Lago, following the release of the redacted report, the president was telling confidants that he was executing the legal strategy against the Democrats that was long his inclination.
“[We’re] gonna give them hell,” Trump said, with a smirk, according to a source with direct knowledge.
Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump’s personal lawyers who repped him during the Mueller investigation, said that over this past Christmas break, he had a sit-down with two former White House counsels—one was a Democrat, the other Republican—to chat about the upcoming legal and investigative hellscape for the president. (Giuliani declined to name names.)
“They said don’t adopt the strategy you had earlier,” Giuliani told The Daily Beast on Wednesday, referencing the White House’s prior strategy of willingly offering troves of information to Mueller’s team.
“This is not a Justice Department investigation, this is a political investigation for partisan purposes,” Giuliani said he was told at the meeting.
He said the two counsels then recommended Trump “hire lots of lawyers, and get ready for a knockout, drag-out fight over everything.”
“Why would you voluntarily cooperate with your enemies who have already announced that you’re guilty?” he added.
Giuliani took their advice to heart—and straight to Trump’s ear. Naturally, the president, who long before becoming leader of the free world leaned heavily on legal threats in his business and celebrity past, was more than happy to take it.
In recent weeks, the sight of adversaries like Reps. Adam Schiff (CA) and Jerry Nadler (NY), on TV being interviewed about investigating Trump and his administration, would send Trump into a rage, causing him to pick up the phone to call his personal attorneys to discuss how to hobble their coming inquiries, according to two knowledgeable sources. He would sometimes then reference these TV clips in subsequent meetings with his attorneys in person.
Starting early this year, the president demanded briefings on his options for how to best go on the offensive. Fairly quickly, he and his team came to an agreement for their standard operating procedure: wage public-relations warfare, refuse to hand over documents (including those related to his taxes), wield executive privilege, block people from sitting for interviews or hearings, and sue if need be. In these meetings, Trump would repeatedly stress that “[we] can’t cooperate” with what was coming down the pike on Capitol Hill.
“The president independently came to that judgment, and I don’t know a lawyer of his, inside or out [of the White House], who doesn’t recommend the same thing,” Giuliani recalled. “I remember over a period of time talking [in meetings with President Trump] about how Congress certainly isn’t operating in good faith, so we better not open up our bathrobe like we did with the special counsel…[And] since we had already turned over everything [to Mueller’s team], why should we turn over them again?”
Over the past few days, Trump, his administration, and his attorneys have started turning the president’s pugnacious desires to reality, including in court papers. Their strategy, of course, applied to more than just the Democratic demands related to the Mueller probe.
On Monday, the White House instructed Carl Kline, a former White House official who oversaw security clearances, not to comply with a House subpoena , arguing that the subpoena “unconstitutionally encroaches on fundamental Executive Branch interests.” Kline reportedly approved Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner’s security clearance in spite of concerns from career officials.
On Tuesday, the Treasury Department and Trump’s legal team breezed past the deadline imposed early this month by Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, who demanded six years’ worth of President Trump’s long-hidden tax returns and related IRS documentation. The committee received zilch, setting the stage for a vicious, protracted court battle .
Then, in an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday, the president flat-out said he opposed his former or current White House officials testifying before Congress because Democratic lawmakers were “obviously very partisan.” The Post had reported that the White House planned to fight the congressional subpoena of former White House Counsel Don McGahn, a major figure in the Mueller report .
By Wednesday, Trump was telling reporters at the White House, “We’re fighting all the subpoenas.”
On the same day, the Justice Department said in a letter to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that John Gore, a top official in the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, would not appear for a deposition scheduled for Thursday. The committee, chaired by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), had authorized a subpoena of Gore earlier this month, and sought to grill him about his role in the Trump administration’s effort to add a question to the 2020 Census regarding U.S. citizenship.
On top of everything else this week, the president made the extraordinary move of suing Cummings in an attempt to thwart a House subpoena of Mazars, an accounting firm used by Trump and his business. When asked by The Daily Beast if Trump is also going to sue any other Democratic lawmakers on other committees probing his finances or taxes , Trump attorney Jay Sekulow indicated such action would be considered if a committee chair issued such a subpoena, noting, “each will be reviewed when issued.”
The back-to-back events of this week are likely merely a preview of the counter-offensives and legal fights to ensue in the remaining Trump years—and it’s a fight that the president seems to relish as an act of retribution.
On Wednesday morning, the president welcomed his former campaign adviser Michael Caputo and his family members to the Oval Office for a roughly half-hour get-together. Trump and his 2016 aide hadn’t spoken for the past two years, and in the time since Caputo had himself become a peripheral figure in the Russia investigations. According to Caputo, Trump told him, now that the Mueller investigation has wrapped, that he’d keep in touch.
The president also indicated to his former adviser that he wanted Democrats to pay for what they’ve done to him and his associates.
“It was very clear to me that the president isn’t the least bit intimidated about all the bluster in Washington about obstruction,” said Caputo. “My advice is for the Democrats to buckle up, based on what he said. It’s going to be a wild ride. The president made it clear during our conversation that he wants to go on the offensive, not stay on the defensive.” READ THIS LIST"

Heather Heyer’s Mom Breaks Silence on Joe Biden Invoking Charlottesville for 2020,www.thedailybeast.com,tim.teeman@thedailybeast.com (Tim Teeman),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/heather-heyers-mom-susan-bro-breaks-silence-on-biden-invoking-charlottesville-for-2020,"exclusive Pool
Joe Biden did not tell Susan Bro, Heather Heyer’s mother, that he would be invoking her daughter’s murder in Charlottesville in August 2017 in his presidential campaign launch video focusing on “the battle for the soul” of America.
“But I wasn’t surprised,” Bro, co-founder of the Heather Heyer Foundation set up in her daughter’s memory, told The Daily Beast. “Most people do that sort of thing. They capitalize on whatever situation is handy. He didn’t reach out to me, and didn’t mention her by name specifically, and he probably knew we don’t endorse candidates.”
In the launch video for his presidential campaign, Biden said, “We are in the battle for the soul of this nation.” American democracy was “at stake” under Trump , he added.
As The Daily Beast reported , the video included footage of men with tiki torches shouting “Jews will not replace us,” and images of swastikas and Confederate flags at the right-wing marches that took place in Charlottesville in 2017.
“We saw Klansmen and white supremacists and neo-Nazis come out in the open,” Biden said. “Their crazed faces illuminated by torches, veins bulging and baring the fangs of racism, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the ’30s.
“That’s when we heard the words of the president of the United States that stunned the world and shocked the conscience of this nation. He said there were quote some ‘very fine people on both sides.’ Very fine people on both sides?” Biden condemned Trump for assigning the same “moral equivalence” to “those spreading hate” as well as “those with the courage to stand against it.”
James Alex Fields Jr. was convicted last year of the first-degree murder of Heyer and multiple further counts of malicious wounding. A jury recommended he serve life in prison. Last month he also pleaded guilty to 29 of 30 federal hate-crime charges in exchange for the prosecutors not seeking the death penalty. He will be formally sentenced in July.
Asked if she had found Biden’s video exploitative, Bro said, “Since we had not spoken, I’m glad he (Biden) didn’t specifically mention Heather. It’s not all about her.” “For me, what he did this morning was that he told me where he stands on one issue. Now tell us the rest of your platform. That’s what I’m waiting to hear”
Bro added, “It’s been almost two years since Heather died. I’m moving forward. I still grieve for my daughter. But I have a realistic understanding that this was a public event, and people will use it however it suits them. It’s just a fact of life.”
Of Biden, she said, “For me, what he did this morning was that he told me where he stands on one issue. Now tell us the rest of your platform. That’s what I’m waiting to hear.”
“I’ve seen that footage a lot lately for other reasons,” said Bro. “It was like, ‘Here we go again.’ I am told by other reporters those who were there at the time have been traumatized by seeing it again. I’ve not spoken to them personally.”
Of President Trump, Bro told The Daily Beast, “He should apply the same thought process as I try to apply for myself: think before you speak, always tell the truth, and be accountable for your actions. I still hold those things out for everyone pretty much. I used to teach my fourth graders that.”
Bro would not be drawn on whether she wanted Trump to remain or be ejected from office.
“Everybody needs to be informed and make their own decision about who to vote for,” Bro said, adding, “I’m the public face of a 501(c)(3)[non profit]. I can’t do that. I have to make it very clear to the public that the Heather Heyer Foundation does not endorse or support any candidates.
“What we as a Foundation and I personally say, is ‘Pay very close attention to what the candidates are saying and also doing. Do the two match up? Find a candidate who believes in what you believe in. Make an informed decision. Don’t just vote on party lines. Make sure you truly support that candidate. And vote.’ Too many people still don’t vote.” “White people say Charlottesville was such a major thing. But murders of people of color in the name of civil rights have gone on for decades, centuries”
Biden’s video didn’t surprise or trigger Bro. “It was more like, ‘Oh yeah, OK, here we go.’ At least twice a week, there’s a news story, documentary, or magazine article mentioning Charlottesville and Heather. It’s not an uncommon thing. It was a defining moment in white history in many ways—a moment when white people finally paid attention. White people say Charlottesville was such a major thing. But murders of people of color in the name of civil rights have gone on for decades, centuries.”
Biden’s video had, Bro said, “shifted my day into high gear very suddenly. It was a little annoying to be woken at 7.20 a.m. to start dealing with it. It reminded me of the press turning up at my home at 9am after Heather died. This was not as intense as that.” READ THIS LIST "
Trump to Hannity: Russia Investigation ‘Was a Coup’ and ‘Attempted Overthrow’ of Government,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-to-hannity-russia-investigation-was-a-coup-and-attempted-overthrow-of-government,"OF COURSE Trump to Hannity: Russia Investigation ‘Was a Coup’ and ‘Attempted Overthrow’ of Government In the same breath, the president boasts about how his 2017 Obama wiretapping claims ‘blew up’ while admitting they were based only on a ‘little bit of a hunch.’ Justin Baragona 04.25.19 10:57 PM ET
In his first television interview since the release of the redacted version of the Mueller report , President Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday night that the investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election was a “coup” and an “attempted overthrow of the United States government.”
Trump, who has largely avoided reporters since last week's release of the special counsel's report revealed at least 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice , called his good friend Hannity to discuss the findings. Or, more accurately, to rant to a pro-Trump audience about how there was “no collusion” and it's time for some payback.
Having begun his broadcast by hyping a new Fox News story about texts previously released last year between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, the conservative primetime star said he disagreed with the president when he said at the beginning of his presidency that he wanted to move past investigating 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
“Do you regret saying that?” Hannity asked, expressing an urgent need to get to the bottom of Clinton's private email server, something Hannity described last week as a current threat to national security.
“No, I don't regret saying it,” Trump replied. “When I won, they were all saying lock her up. Lock her up. I said no, no. Let's get on with life. That was different.”
Trump went on to claim that he felt differently now because shortly after the election, “they started coming at us with the insurance policy,” referring to the Russia probe. After railing against the investigation into Clinton's email server and claiming Clinton “destroyed” lives, the president called former FBI officials James Comey and Andrew McCabe “dirty cops.”
“This was a coup,” Trump exclaimed. “This was an attempted overthrow of the United States government... This was an overthrow and it's a disgraceful thing.”
The president also revisited his unsubstantiated March 2017 claim that President Obama had wiretapped him at Trump Tower during the election, boasting to Hannity that his assertion had received attention “like you've never seen” while admitting that it was based only on a “little bit of a hunch.”
Trump said the claim “blew up because they thought maybe I was wise to them.”
During his congressional testimony earlier this month , Attorney General William Barr prompted Democratic backlash when he said he believed “spying did occur” on the Trump campaign during 2016, remarks he would somewhat walk back later. READ THIS LIST"
‘Beetlejuice’ on Broadway: It Was a Horror Show. Now It Feels Like a Hit.,www.thedailybeast.com,tim.teeman@thedailybeast.com (Tim Teeman),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/beetlejuice-on-broadway-it-was-a-horror-show-now-it-feels-like-a-hit,"GHOST BUSTER ‘Beetlejuice’ on Broadway: It Was a Horror Show. Now It Feels Like a Hit. It got bad reviews when it premiered in Washington, D.C. But now the musical version of the hit Tim Burton movie has been rewritten and rebooted, and is a rollicking piece of fun. 04.25.19 9:05 PM ET Courtesy Matthew Murphy
This critic didn’t see the version of Beetlejuice in Washington, D.C., that received a critical mauling. That mauling was resounding enough to approach Beetlejuice on Broadway, which opens Thursday night (at the Winter Garden, to October 6) with trepidation—and it also seems to have galvanized the production to change too, seemingly all for the better.
In this musical version of Tim Burton’s 1988 movie (many years in the making), gone post-D.C. is a weird-sounding boyband number, and the sight of a teenage girl selling Girl Scout cookies being chased by a troupe of male ghosts. The music and script have been rebooted.
Last month, the New York Post ’s Michael Riedel reported that director Alex Timbers “sat down with the creative team and went through the show ‘beat by beat,’ expunging all that was tasteless, lewd and inappropriate in the post-# MeToo era. He also asked for better jokes and songs.
“He realized the show as written can’t be done in the cultural landscape we’re living in,” another source told Riedel. “He wanted to get rid of what was gross and cheap, and find another way of telling the story.”
Timbers and team have certainly done that. Beetlejuice , as it now presents itself, is a loopy, nutty, loud, winning hoot. It’s still pretty tasteless, lewd and inappropriate too—just acceptably so. It is marks the final Broadway opening of Tony Awards season, the fifth in this final week; the nominations for all the eligible dramas and musicals will be announced on Tuesday.
The cast and creative team of Beetlejuice pay tribute to Burton in the musical’s program, writing that the director’s imagination “has inspired us all throughout our many years working on this show. We are grateful that he cleared a path for us to play in the extraordinary world of his creation.”
If you are a fan of the film, there are plot similarities and divergences. Actually, the story careens all over the place, which doesn’t matter because the performances are mostly excellent and the sets by David Korins notably stunning (including a mansion living room seemingly redecorated mid-performance).
Peter Negrini’s projections and Kenneth Posner’s lighting, particularly evoking the Netherworld, deserve awards all of their own; they’re that hypnotically impressive. William Ivey Long ’s costumes—from Beetlejuice’s (Alex Brightman) stripy suits to Lydia’s (Sophia Anne Caruso) goth wear and frilled red wedding dress—are gorgeous.
Eddie Perfect’s songs and Connor Gallagher’s choreography are a colorfully married riot, with the occasional ballad thrown in to underscore the play’s valiant attempt at staying serious. Scott Brown and Anthony King’s book is full of snark, spark, and wit.
We first meet Beetlejuice, complaining about the musical itself. “Holy crap! A ballad already,” he kvetches. He complains about everything, but if we are to understand anything, it’s that his stinky malevolence is down to loneliness. Brightman is a gale of moods, a demented clown; he is a prince of anarchy and also a whining dweeb, a joker and self-pitying tragedian.
This is why he is so horrified by the balanced natures and sweet functionality of Barbara (Kerry Butler) and Adam (the brilliant Rob McClure), who at the start of the show are happily getting a home ready for a family of their own. But then, disaster strikes: they die. They are the peppiest of plaid-clad suburbanites : bland, vanilla, and goofily charming. “Prepare also for giant sand worms and dancing skeletons. And lots of zingers, fourth walls being broken, and a stage that is a frenzy of activity and visual delights”
Beetlejuice suggests they haunt their own home, driving new owner Charles (Adam Dannheisser) and daughter Lydia (Sophia Anne Caruso) from the house. Charles is having a relationship with Delia (Leslie Kritzer), a life coach who’s lived a bit on many sides of the tracks. Kritzer’s performance is one of the comic cherries-on-top of the Broadway season, and even has its own showstopping song-and-dance routine at the top of act two.
All kinds of chaos unfolds as Barbara and Adam’s haunting plans fall flat, and Beetlejuice’s plans, which are bigger and much badder than Barbara and Adam’s simple frights, get more and more elaborate and deadly in intention.
“This is a show about death,” we are told at the beginning, and Beetlejuice isn’t kidding. Prepare also for giant sand worms, dancing skeletons, and lots of zingers, along with fourth walls being smashed, and a stage that is a frenzy of activity and visual delights.
There is still the creepiness of Beetlejuice wanting to marry the teenage Lydia, but throughout this song-and-dance sequence we are reassured “it’s only for a green card,” and that the age-gap marriage is creepy in multiple cultural contexts. It's still an oddly yukky premise and song, but has been made just about acceptable with its repeated qualifications.
Indeed, Caruso has the trickiest role: to play a sulky brat, and also a wounded teenager missing her dead mom and thereby piloting the musical’s serious moments around navigating grief and parental loss. Her character also shares top billing with Brightman's title character. Her ballads and earnestness are the only brakes on the craziness elsewhere; this nightmare circus eventually includes a dead pig brought to life.
Yes, the show is an extremely long two and a half plus hours, yes it feels off-balance in places, but it is also shameless, big, bold, fun and brassy. This is the miss that may well become a hit. READ THIS LIST"

Now that former Vice President Joe Biden has officially tossed his hat into the 2020 Democratic presidential primary , The Daily Show host Trevor Noah revealed that he’s partially hoping Biden snags the nomination just so we can see “the most entertaining debates of all time” as he and President Trump get into an “old man fight.”
Explaining Thursday night that the former veep comes into the race with a “whole lot of baggage,” Noah highlighted Biden’s tendency to stick his foot in his mouth , showing clips of Biden asking a man in a wheelchair to stand and casually tossing out racial stereotypes.
“I feel like these gaffes are what made Biden the perfect balance to Obama,” Noah remarked before impersonating the former president speaking very slowly and measured.
“But when Biden talks, his brain just clicks ‘I’m feeling lucky’ and the first words come out of his mouth,” the Comedy Central star joked.
After discussing Biden’s lengthy legislative career and policy achievements, as well as the issues he’ll face over his problematic handling of the Anita Hill hearing and his vote for the Iraq War, Noah said that Democrats will still likely turn out for Biden due partly to “how progressive he’s become and partly because of how good he is at getting under Trump’s skin.”
He proceeded to play a series of clips of Biden saying he wishes he could take Trump “behind the gym” and Trump returning fire, comments which he predicted could very easily turn the 2020 election into a spectacle with a couple of 70-plus-year-olds throwing down.
“Old man fights! Old man fight! Old man fight!” Noah chanted while pounding his fists up and down.
“This would be hilarious,” he continued. “These two dudes fighting? It’s like ‘Let’s get ready to stumble!’ It would be the most entertaining fight. Are they going to knock each other's teeth out, pick them up, and put them back in again?”
Noah then snarked that they should make this fight happen just so they can raise money for charity, adding that it’s a “win-win” for everyone as Biden can “stand up to Trump and Trump gets to secretly keep the money for charity.”
The segment ended with animated versions of Trump and Biden physically fighting and throwing out insults on a debate stage in front of a raucous crowd, ending with Trump landing a Karate Kid -esque crane kick. READ THIS LIST"

Officers reportedly first investigated the incident at Pinnacle High School on Monday after the classmate said he heard the 15-year-old suspect say he wanted to “blow up a Muslim church.” On Tuesday, the same classmate said he saw the suspect carrying a plastic bag holding several pounds of a white powdery substance and reported what he had seen to school officials. Police tested the substance and determined it was potassium nitrate, which can be mixed with other chemicals to create highly flammable “flash powder.” Police said there’s no indication the school or anyone in connection to it was in danger.

Sri Lankan officials on Thursday revised the death toll from the Easter Sunday terror bombings , dropping the number of fatalities from 359 to 253. The reason for the discrepancy is gruesome: “Some of the bodies get severely damaged in these kinds of explosions and it’s possible for some bodies to get completely destroyed or break into parts, making the identification of full bodies difficult,” the country’s ministry of health said in a statement cited by CNN. “Hence, counting an exact death toll is challenging.” The investigation into the coordinated suicide bombings, believed to potentially be the work of an ISIS-inspired terror network , is still ongoing.

"‘Avengers: Endgame’ Is An Emotional, Balls-to-the-Wall Finale to the Marvel Cinematic Universe",www.thedailybeast.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/avengers-endgame-is-an-emotional-balls-to-the-wall-finale-to-the-marvel-cinematic-universe,"‘Avengers: Endgame’ Is an Emotional, Balls-to-the-Wall Finale to the Marvel Cinematic Universe Marvel Studios Several doors close and several more open in this fitting end to the first three phases of the MCU. Melissa Leon 04.26.19 6:36 AM ET
A common complaint against the Marvel Cinematic Universe in its 22 films and 11 years of existence zeroes in on the saga’s perpetual delay of real consequences. Rhodey broke his back in Captain America: Civil War ? He’s back on his feet by the next film. Tony finally comprehends his own limits in Iron Man 3 , but by Age of Ultron , that lesson seems half-forgotten. Even Thanos’ universe-decimating Snap in Infinity War tipped us off to its impermanence the moment Black Panther and Spider-Man went up in dust, despite sequels already planned for each. Avengers: Endgame , we already knew, would have to undo the damage. That meant consequences would not be delayed this time—they’d be straight-up erased.
But Endgame —the sequel to Infinity War and a capstone on the most popular movie franchise of all time—is unique in the Marvel universe for how, in some regards, the buck really, actually stops here. The fallout from this movie may be irreversible. But it’s that finality that makes Endgame such a satisfying adventure and a near-perfect conclusion to the MCU’s first Avengers saga.
Endgame is patient enough to allow each of the six surviving original Avengers (Black Widow, Hulk, Hawkeye, Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man) time and space to reckon with not only their legacies as heroes, but with personal grief, self-doubt, and their lives’ unfulfilled potential. It’s heavy stuff handled beautifully in three hours that succeeds as a reward for investing in these characters; it dissects each of their mythos with insight and affectionate detail.
After Infinity War , it was never a matter of if certain dusted characters would return, but how . To its credit, Endgame plants inventive, emotional surprises at every plot turn toward the inevitable. We pick up a few weeks after the greatest frustration of the Avengers’ career: failing to stop the purple megalomaniac Thanos (Josh Brolin) from using the Infinity Stones to turn half the universe to dust. An early, hopeful attempt at setting things right falls apart. From there, each hero is left for long, quiet stretches to contend with their failures.
Some struggle to move on, others are consumed by it. A pair will comfort each other over PB&J sandwiches here, another two will bicker and point fingers there. The relentless pace of Infinity War left little time for human-scale interactions like these, despite the shawarma-eating , house-party hangout scenes invariably being the best parts of Avengers movies. They’re the moments that feel most like watching a family. That’s an important theme in Endgame , it turns out: “I used to have nothing,” Natasha says at one point. “Then I got this job, this family, and was better because of it. Even though they’re gone, I’m still trying to be better.”
Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), who’s been stuck in the Quantum Realm since last summer’s Ant-Man and the Wasp , squirms his way into the Avengers’ orbit again with a plan. But by then, some heroes have adjusted to their new normal, even learned to relish it. It’s an honest look at change, really—there’s no telling what’s on the other side.
As scripted by Marvel veterans Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, Endgame is smart enough to realize that undoing the Snap isn’t actually our most pressing concern. The real focus here is six longtime friends (though there are about a hundred named characters that flit on and off-screen from different eras of the MCU) and their evolving relationships with one another. It’s an epic movie brimming with intimate moments that celebrate these characters’ shared histories—and not just theirs, but our own with them, too.
The last 11 years has seen the creation, deepening, and challenging of these characters onscreen; we’ve aged along with them, so to remember their past is to recall a bit of our own. Endgame is obsessed with this idea. It recreates familiar situations and summons old faces to confront each hero with the sum of their past, often to melancholy effect. That sense of shared experience may be why audiences react so strongly to this movie—I heard gasps, cheers, laughter, and weeping to match my own all around me in the theater. Endgame may be unabashedly self-referential, but it’s a victory lap for Marvel that’s well earned. There’s not another pop-culture property right now (save perhaps Game of Thrones ) that’s fostered such fierce attachment to fictional people.
Not that Endgame is strictly a memorial service; each major player continues to change in dynamic, even startling ways. It helps that each of the six principal actors—Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, and Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark—know their characters better than anyone now, and act the ever-living hell out of their final performances together. “ The usual, steady Marvel clip of wise-ass humor functions less to undercut serious moments, and more as natural relief—grief is what makes their jokes believable here. ”
Natasha, the once-inscrutable assassin turned moral compass of the Avengers, is more vulnerable here than she’s ever been. Thor, the earnest doofus who happens to be a god, reaches surprisingly dark depths as he’s overwhelmed by all that he’s lost. Clint warps his anger into violence against petty criminals around the world. Bruce and Tony, meanwhile, reveal sides of themselves that would have seemed, if not impossible, at least extremely far-fetched a decade ago.
Steve Rogers is a changed man, too. He’s wearier, more pragmatic, a little rougher around the edges—and funnier than he’s ever been. This is the first movie in which he dares utter a swear word, reflecting how he’s loosened up. It’s also the first time in years he’s expressed sadness over the life he never had with the love of his life, Peggy Carter. It’s one of many long-neglected character beats granted oxygen in this film, from Natasha and Clint’s best friendship to the lack of closure in Tony’s relationship with his father.
Because much of Endgame lingers in more personal drama, the usual, steady Marvel clip of wise-ass humor functions less to undercut serious moments, and more as natural relief—grief is what makes their jokes believable here. (The film’s sci-fi premise, along with Hulk’s sweaters, Thor’s Big Lebowski makeover, and a line about “America’s ass” bring brilliant comedy, too.)
The film’s action scenes are less coherently choreographed than the Russos’ previous efforts in Winter Soldier and Civil War . But they make up for it in the pure spectacle of one dizzying last stand—a balls-out bananas, practically biblical-level battle unmatched in scale and chaos within the MCU. It’s the kind of action figure-smashing display of little-kid imagination ripe for dismissal as fan service. (I thought instantly of Patton Oswalt’s Star Wars filibuster from Parks and Rec .) Still, after 11 years spent assembling each individual piece with painstaking care, it’s a glorious sequence to behold.
Not every hero walks out of that battle—and I won’t spoil the machinations of the plot to undo the Snap, or what goes down between Nebula (Karen Gillan) and her “father,” or how Captain America and Iron Man resolve the rift between them after Civil War .

10 Dishes With Chef Max Ng,www.thedailybeast.com,noah.rothbaum@thedailybeast.com (Noah Rothbaum),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/10-dishes-with-chef-max-ng-of-new-yorks-momofuku-ssam-bar,"BEHIND THE STOVE 10 Dishes With Chef Max Ng The executive chef of New York’s Momofuku Ssäm Bar tackles our speed round of questions. 04.26.19 4:58 AM ET Courtesy Momofuku
After a shift, what is your favorite guilty pleasure to eat? “I have some places to get grub around where I live. Dollar slices of pizza, pad thai, Subway or a bodega sando. But recently, I’ve been trying not to eat much after work to trim the fat. That being said, my GM bought me these Thai Coconut M&M’s recently—they’re quite fun and quirky.”
Is there one dish you won’t cook? “This might be an offbeat answer to your question, but my grandmother used to brew this ultra-black herbal drink/soup for me while I was growing up in Singapore, and it’s probably the weirdest concoction I’ve ever tasted in my life. I’ve never known what was in that potent liquid, and I can only remember her coaxing me and forcing the glass to my face, constantly telling me, ‘it’s good for you, it’s good for you, drink it!’”
All-time favorite spice. “White pepper is a re-discovery for me as a chef, but it’s used in some of my favorite dishes back in Singapore. You use an obscene amount of white pepper to cook a pork rib soup called Bak Kut Teh, and it’s the white version that has no soy sauce. It’s very light, super refreshing and spicy—it’s great to get when you want to clear nasal congestion.”
What is your favorite music to listen to while you cook? “My American friends jab jokes at me for listening to an entire spectrum of ‘outdated music,’ which I love and embrace. It goes from Frank Sinatra to the Red Hot Chili Peppers to Fuel to Savage Garden to Craig David, it’s all over the place. I think I got into a vicious cycle of listening to the same stuff forever.”
Did you grow up cooking as a child? “I did not grow up being overly curious about food. My grandmother would chase me out of the kitchen when I tried to poke around her business. However, I did grow up loving food, and eating out is a huge part of the culture in Singapore, and the diversity of food available is one of her beauties.”
What cookbook is your go-to resource for inspiration? “There are many sources for inspiration in today’s social media climate. It’s so much easier to see what others are doing on Instagram nowadays, especially with geo-tags and hashtags factored in. It’s not too hard to get sucked into a rabbit hole of oblivion. I remember there was a time when I did not have the luxury of space and money to buy books, and I would go to the Barnes & Noble in Union Square in NYC to browse new cookbooks, and it was a great way to briefly check out five different books in a short period of time.”
After all these years working in restaurants, do you still enjoy going out to eat? “I believe most chefs get into the restaurant business stemming from some very primitive and visceral feelings within themselves, and part of it for me is the enjoyment of eating and sharing that same enjoyment with others. That might sound very corny but it’s true for myself. As a younger cook, I used to be so obsessed with the details of the dishes and service and would have fun picking it apart and making sense of it all. Nowadays, I’ve learned how to live in the moment, enjoy the company of others and just let loose and ebb with the flow of the night.”
Is there one chef you’d like to cook with? “This is tough since there are countless chefs out there that I look up to. But it has to be between Seiji Yamamoto of Nihonryori RyuGin in Tokyo and Corey Lee of Benu in San Francisco. I’ve had a meal in both places and was utterly floored with the level of precision, execution and commitment to cuisine.”
Name the all-time best cooking show. “I think this is not a very popular show in the U.S., or I’ve been asking the wrong people because very few of my chef friends know what I am talking about. I grew up in Singapore watching Yan Can Cook with Martin Yan. He’s always able to captivate a live audience with his ways. I’ll always remember the phrase, ‘If Yan can Cook, so can You!’”
What is the one tool that you always make sure to pack when you’re traveling for business? “Other than the obvious tools, I am trying to get better with planning and delegation, so either a notebook or a clipboard to hold loose sheets of paper that I can scribble notes on, and printouts of information.”
Max Ng is executive chef of Momofuku Ssäm Bar in New York’s East Village. He’s a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America.

Netflix’s ‘Chambers’ Is a Body-Horror Disasterpiece,www.thedailybeast.com,Nick Schager,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/netflixs-chambers-is-a-body-horror-disasterpiece,"HARD PASS Netflix’s ‘Chambers’ Is a Body-Horror Disasterpiece The Uma Thurman and Tony Goldwyn-starrer, dropping April 26 on the streamer, is a huge misfire. 04.26.19 4:58 AM ET Ursula Coyote/Netflix
There isn’t a single inventive scare lurking in Chambers , a 10-episode Netflix original that seems like it was devised by the streaming service’s famed algorithm.
Embellishing a 13 Reasons Why template with stock supernatural insanity, Leah Rachel’s series (premiering April 26) concerns the twisty-turny investigation into the death of Becky Lefevre (Lilliya Scarlett Reid), a well-to-do blonde Arizona teenager who perished in a mysterious accident. The cause of Becky’s untimely demise is potentially related to a cast of shady characters, both young and old. Yet the twist isn’t that Becky was offed under shadowy circumstances—it’s that the sleuth leading the inquiry is Sasha (Sivan Alyra Rose), the organ-transplant recipient of Becky’s heart.
Sasha, a Native American girl who’s been denied a relationship with her heritage by her long-haired, heavily tattooed uncle Frank (Marcus LaVoi), is driven to learn more about Becky not only because she’s grateful for her ticker, but because she can “feel” Becky inside her. If that sounds eerily reminiscent of Body Parts , the 1991 thriller in which Jeff Fahey gradually loses control of his transplanted arm (which belonged to a serial killer!), that’s because it is—except here, the conceit is drawn out to absurd lengths, such that it won’t take audiences nearly as long as Sasha to figure out what, precisely, is going on. That calamitous situation is compounded by the jumbled nature of the plot itself, which shoves issues of grief, guilt, addiction, identity, ethnicity, religion and social/economic divides into a proverbial creative blender. No matter the participation of Uma Thurman and Tony Goldwyn , the resultant mixture is a sloppy mess.
Chambers takes its sweet time establishing its premise, doling out clues about Sasha’s spooky state of affairs in drips and drabs. Saved by Becky’s aorta after suffering a heart attack at the very moment she was going to lose her virginity to boyfriend TJ (Griffin Powell-Arcand), Sasha reluctantly agrees to meet Becky’s parents Ben (Goldwyn) and Nancy (Thurman), whose teen son Elliot (Nicholas Galitzine) is an empathy-deficient drug addict. They’re an upper-class clan who, destabilized by the loss of their beloved Becky, are intent on bringing Sasha into their swanky fold, first by offering her a scholarship to attend Becky’s ritzy high school, and later by giving her the keys to their dead child’s Prius. Such generosity seems strange to Sasha and Frank, who supports them both by running an aquatic pet store. Nonetheless, given their wrong-side-of-the-tracks struggles, they’re compelled to accept this golden opportunity to improve Sasha’s prospects.
It’s not long before Sasha is plagued by visions of Becky in windows, mirrors and her dreams, which are also populated by menacing masked figures and a boy that Sasha will eventually meet. That the deceased girl is trapped inside Sasha is a fact staring everyone square in the face (even the title credits meld their countenances together), and yet Chambers has its characters move toward that revelation at a crawl. More frustrating still, many of its primary players do realize that Sasha is exhibiting Becky-ish traits—Ben notes that she knows how to tie boating knots, despite having never sailed; Nancy sees her twirl her hair and mutter things just like adolescent Becky—only to then intermittently forget about it, the better to prolong matters and postpone climactic confrontations about these patently paranormal events.
Sasha soon assumes Becky’s life at school—where she interacts with stalker-ish Penelope (Lilli Kay), overly helpful Marnie (Sarah Mezzanotte), Marnie’s beau Ravi (Jonny Rios), and understanding guidance counselor Coach Jones (Michael Stahl-David)—and at home, where she becomes a surrogate daughter for the Lefevres. Since Sasha lost her mom at a young age, she’s receptive to Nancy’s maternal affection. Unfortunately, Chambers addresses these bonds in a scattershot way that undercuts their believability. The same holds for Sasha’s fish-out-of-water experiences in Becky’s affluent environs, which inspire feelings of displacement, but have precious little to do with the mystery at hand. Like so much of the series, these elements are window dressing, thrown into the mix in the vain hope that they’ll lend the action some heft.
New-age cultists (led by Lili Taylor), drug-fueled hallucinations, mouse mutilation and a crazy old homeless lady—the last of which factors into the show’s most inane bombshell—help keep the material overstuffed, and capable of wasting entire episodes casting suspicion on individuals who clearly had nothing to do with Becky’s passing. Once again in horror territory after last year’s Lars von Trier thriller The House that Jack Built , Thurman acts hyper-skittish and tormented, while Goldwyn behaves cheerily shifty (he’s a New Age true-believer). Since both are meant to be possible bad guys, neither is allowed a persuasive moment of sorrow, thereby negating any engagement with their plight. Instead, their primary task is to maintain the story’s hysterical tone.
Newcomer Rose doesn’t fare any better; with a sullen look almost permanently affixed to her face, her Sasha is a cipher who begins with little agency, and winds up with even less once Becky makes her presence actively felt. In Rose’s defense, though, Chambers doesn’t know how to make anyone the least bit interesting—its high schoolers are all familiar types (The clingy weirdo! The bitchy rich girl! The loyal techie!), and its adults are either well-meaning caregivers or devious monsters hiding their evil behind welcoming smiles. Consequently, none of them make any impact—save for Elliott, whose constant habit of calling his mom “Nancy” is initially grating, and then downright insufferable.
Aside from the rare inspired image (the best: mice bursting forth from a chest cavity), Chambers botches its gruesomeness and suspense, so busy is it concentrating on superfluous things like Sasha BFF Yvonne’s (Kyanna Simone Simpson) dementia-addled mom and Frank’s conflict with his father, whose Native American spirituality is used to decorate the show’s hackneyed portrait of ghosts being unable to rest until they can right a grievous wrong. Most will feel as if they’ve already seen Chambers before. Those new to such substandard beyond-the-grave stuff, on the other hand, will wish they’d never seen it in the first place. READ THIS LIST"
Will Trump Pardon Border Agents Who Shot an Unarmed Man and Covered It Up?,www.thedailybeast.com,Ruben Navarrette Jr.,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/will-trump-pardon-border-agents-who-shot-an-unarmed-man-and-covered-it-up,"TOO HARSH? Will Trump Pardon Border Agents Who Shot an Unarmed Man and Covered It Up? The story would have been long forgotten had the agents been Smith and Jones, rather than Ramos and Compean. opinion Brendan Smialowski/Getty
SAN DIEGO, California—We’re in a dark and dangerous place when law enforcement officers think they can break the law with impunity.
The picture gets even darker and more dangerous when the law-and order-crowd sacrifices credibility and makes a mockery of their stated values to make excuses for their own lawbreakers.
We don’t have to be talking about some grand scheme to violate the law for personal gain that comes unraveled. Sometimes, law enforcement officers wind up in hot water for making bad decisions in the heat of the moment.
Which brings us to the seemingly never-ending saga of Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, a pair of former Border Patrol agents who lost their badges, went on trial, testified on their own behalf, were convicted by a jury of their peers, and went to prison for what were supposed to be long stretches because of some very bad decisions they made on the afternoon of Feb. 17, 2005.
That was the day that Ramos and Compean shot, and wounded, an illegal immigrant drug smuggler—and instantly morphed into pop culture heroes for the anti-immigrant mob of cable-news hosts, GOP congressmen, nativist organizations, border vigilantes, right-wing bloggers and their fans who rail against immigration—both legal and illegal—because they want to turn back the demographic tide and make America white again.
In a court of law, Ramos and Compean had neither the law nor the facts on their side. But in the court of nativist public opinion, they had two things going for them: first, that the person they shot was a low-life career criminal who lacked the legal status to be in the United States in the first place, and he was shot while committing a crime; second, that his shooters were Hispanic, the kind of fact that gets seized upon by racists who like to pretend they’re not racist.
Let’s just say, if the agents had been named “Smith” and “Jones,” I doubt the story would have gotten as much attention as it did.
I certainly don’t think that we’d still be talking about the case all these years later. Nor do I think that the disgraced agents would have won the heart of Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-CA, an immigration hardliner.
Fun fact: The San Diego congressman is, along with his wife, currently on the business end of a federal indictment for allegedly misusing at least $250,000 of campaign funds for personal expenses including his family’s dental work, golf outings, video games, groceries, expensive meals out as well as vacations to Italy and Hawaii. The couple pleaded not guilty to the charges, and they were released on a $15,000 bond while awaiting trial.
Meanwhile, Ramos and Compean were sentenced to 11 years and 12 years in prison respectively.
However, they only served about two years. In January 2009, on his final day in office, President George W. Bush commuted their sentences. At the time, a senior administration official said that Bush, upon reviewing the case, believed that while it was true the agents deserved punishment for violating their oaths to uphold the law, “the sentences they received were too harsh” and “they, and their families, have suffered enough for their crimes.”
Not satisfied with that, Hunter has been urging President Trump to grant Ramos and Compean a full pardon with all the trimmings, which would expunge their personal records of the felonies.
I’ve covered this story from the beginning, and I can say this much: Ramos and Compean are as guilty as sin.
The story has not changed over the last 14 years. On Feb. 17, 2005, at about 1:00 pm, while on patrol on the U.S.-Mexico border, near the small town of Fabens, Texas, Ramos and Compean spotted a suspicious van—one that turned to be hauling 700 pounds of marijuana into the United States. Once he spotted the agents, the driver of the van—Osvaldo Aldrete-Davila— abandoned the vehicle and, according to investigators with the Department of Homeland Security, put his hands in the air and tried to surrender.
Aldrete-Davila was unarmed, and we know this because the agents themselves confirmed it at trial. They said that, as they approached the van and he began to run, they took note of his hands, and saw no weapon.
Instead of taking the suspect into custody, investigators found, Compean swung at him with the butt of his shotgun and missed. Aldrete-Davila ran across the border, and Ramos and Compean began shooting.
Compean fired at least 14 rounds and Ramos fired once, hitting Aldrete-Davila in the buttock. The smuggler then hobbled away into Mexico to heal his wounds. The agents collected and disposed of the shell casings, didn’t announce the shooting to the dispatcher on the radio, never told colleagues or supervisors about the incident, and filed official reports that made no mention of it.
So, for those keeping score at home, we now have two border patrol agents who shot and wounded an unarmed Mexican illegal immigrant and drug smuggler and then tried to cover it up and pretend it never happened by destroying evidence and falsifying reports. All in a day’s work.
And that’s where the story would have ended if not for the comadre grapevine. Mex-America is a small world, and it just so happens that Aldrete-Davila’s mother, Macaria Aldrete-Davila, who lived in Chihuahua had a lifelong friend named Gregoria Toquinto, with whom she had grown up in a small village in Mexico. And one day, not long after the shooting, Macaria is telling Gregoria about how her son, Osvaldo (who probably told his mom nothing about the drugs and claimed he was up north on a business trip) had been crossing into the United States, and how he’d been shot in the backside by a couple of Border Patrol agents. Seems the bullet was still lodged in his groin, and he needed medical attention. Quite the telenovela, que no?
Toquinto then shares this information with her son-in-law who lives in Arizona where he works as—wait for it—a Border Patrol agent. Quicker than you can say “desmadre,” there’s an internal investigation by the Department of Homeland Security. And the rest is history. With a dash of folklore.
My favorite part of this story? The fact that the federal jury that eventually convicted Ramos and Compean on five out of six criminal charges including assault with a deadly weapon, obstruction of justice, and violating someone’s civil rights heard both sides of the story. The jurors heard the agents’ testimony and then they heard from Aldrete-Davila—who was given a “humanitarian pass” by the U.S. government to re-enter the United States, legally this time, to get medical treatment. And, when it was all said and done, they found the Border Patrol agents less credible than a drug smuggler with a bullet in his ass.
Fun fact: Even after Ramos and Compean were convicted and went to prison, that humanitarian pass did not go to waste. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Aldrete-Davila allegedly used it to bring more drugs across the border. You can’t make this stuff up.
There are no saints in this story. But there is a fair amount of cynicism. Over the years, a parade of anti-immigrant opportunists have wrapped themselves in the legend of two flawed border patrol agents to camouflage their real agenda—which is now, and has always been, to keep out of this country as many brown people as possible.
This is also Trump’s agenda. And so, as the latest opportunist to try to get mileage out of the tale of Ramos and Compean—perhaps as a distraction from his own legal troubles—Rep. Hunter is probably betting that he can get the president to ignore the facts, buy the fairy tale and pardon the offenders.
That could happen. But, for the sake of the integrity of the criminal justice system, let’s hope it doesn’t. READ THIS LIST"
Joe Biden’s Last-Minute Call to Anita Hill Backfires With Women,www.thedailybeast.com,Emily.Shugerman@thedailybeast.com (Emily Shugerman),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/joe-bidens-last-minute-call-to-anita-hill-backfires-with-women,"TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE Joe Biden’s Last-Minute Call to Anita Hill Backfires With Women The newly minted presidential candidate knew he had to make things right with Anita Hill before the campaign got under way. But to many women—and Hill herself—he didn’t do enough. 04.26.19 4:57 AM ET Jennifer Law/Getty
Joe Biden may have thought that patching things up with Anita Hill was the best way to jump-start his presidential campaign. But to many women— including Hill herself —the former vice president’s phone call 28 years after the fact only rubbed salt in the wound.
“The only person I will allow to say that he's done enough is Anita Hill herself,” said women’s rights activist Andrea Pino, who previously worked with Biden on campus anti-rape efforts. “And if Anita Hill is saying that he has not properly apologized, then I will go with what she said.”
Biden’s campaign says he called Hill weeks ago to address lingering tension around the 1991 confirmation hearings in which Hill accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Many now fault Biden, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time, for failing to give her allegations a fair hearing. Biden himself has expressed remorse for what she endured while testifying.
But in an interview with The New York Times published Thursday—the day of Biden’s 2020 campaign kickoff—Hill said his recent phone call did not constitute an apology. “I cannot be satisfied by simply saying, ‘I’m sorry for what happened to you,” she said. “I will be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose.”
To many women, the decades-delayed call felt disingenuous—a thinly veiled attempt to win back female voters energized by the #MeToo movement and Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings . If that was the intent, however, it seems to have backfired.
“[Biden] is primarily focused on what he believes acknowledgement looks like and what he thinks it means to take responsibility, instead of centering the needs and the requests of the people that he's harmed,” said Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of women’s rights group UltraViolet.
“The experience we've had of him is sort of taking half responsibility and half measures,” she added. “It seems he's kind of taking that road again, and I think women are going to continue to be frustrated by the way he's showing up.”
Thomas also acknowledged, however, that she wasn’t sure how the controversy would affect him in the polls. Biden’s presidential ambitions have already been rocked by allegations that he touched women in ways that made them feel uncomfortable —allegations he later appeared to mock at a public event. With the Hill call, Thomas said, “I don’t think he lost any more ground than he could have lost.”
It also wasn’t the first time Biden attempted to make things right with Hill. In 2017, the former vice president told Teen Vogue he wished he could have done more during her hearing, and said he owed her an apology. (He did not call her at the time to deliver it.) Just last month, Biden told an audience of campus anti-rape activists he was sorry he “couldn’t give her the kind of hearing she deserved,” adding, “I wish I could have done something.”
Molly Coleman, an organizer with Harvard Law’s Pipeline Parity Project, said she did not think Biden had taken full responsibility for his role in the hearing. That, coupled with the allegations of inappropriate touching, made her question whether the former vice president was ready to tackle gender inequality more broadly.
“If he wants to be the president of the United States of America, this is something that is going to be confronting him in big and small ways,” she said. “And if in this example—that has been the topic of national conversation for decades—you’re not able to do better, it’s really disappointing.”
Brenda Choresi Carter, the director of the Reflective Democracy Campaign, took a more optimistic view. While she left it to Hill to decide whether Biden’s call was adequate, Carter said the fact that he felt obligated to call at all showed how times have changed. With a record number of women and women of color running for president, she said, candidates like Biden now have to take their issues and experiences seriously—even if they don’t always get it right.
“It really points to the significance of several other women in the presidential race,” she said. “They have a certain kind of life experience that others want to see represented in the halls of power, and it increases the demand on Joe Biden and other candidates to demonstrate some kind of understanding of those life experiences—even if they haven’t lived them.”"
Ari Melber’s Message to Trump Fans: Be Like Jay Sekulow and Come on My MSNBC Show,www.thedailybeast.com,lloyd.grove@thedailybeast.com (Lloyd Grove),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/ari-melbers-message-to-trump-fans-be-like-jay-sekulow-and-come-on-my-msnbc-show,"FAIR HEARING Even Trump’s Personal Attorney Jay Sekulow Likes MSNBC’s Ari Melber Jay Sekulow, Trump’s personal attorney, calls MSNBC’s Ari Melber ‘a smart guy.’ Melber says Trump enthusiasts think his show ‘is fair enough that they can get their views out.’ 04.26.19 4:57 AM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Getty/NBC
Few would guess that Ari Melber is anything other than a progressive Democrat. More than a decade ago, before law school, the Seattle-born Melber toiled as a legislative aide for Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, then held down various jobs on Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry ’s ill-fated 2004 presidential campaign.
But now, at age 39, he’s a registered independent in Brooklyn—having renounced the label of partisanship while anchoring his own show at 6 p.m, The Beat , and working as a legal analyst for NBC News and chief legal correspondent for MSNBC.
Melber is something of an outlier on the liberal-leaning cable network, and not only because his show regularly features hip-hop stars—his musical obsession since high school—and, almost nightly, he finds an excuse to introduce rap lyrics into an otherwise sober discussion.
It’s also because he is a rare MSNBC host who regularly welcomes Donald Trump enthusiasts into his studio at 30 Rock, and listens patiently, if critically, as they make their case.
One fan is Jay Sekulow , President Trump’s combative, camera-ready personal attorney.
“I like him, he’s a tough questioner, and I think that makes it all the more interesting,” Sekulow, a recent first-time guest on The Beat , told The Daily Beast about Melber. “He’s a smart guy. Where we agree we agree, and we where disagree we disagree, but it’s never personal. I would not go on if it was. It’s not. He’s a tough inquisitor, and in a constitutional republic, that’s a good thing.”
Sekulow said he has spoken with Melber as recently as this week about going in front of The Beat ’s audience in the near future. But such warm and friendly feelings would have been difficult to discern from Sekulow’s sword-crossing maiden appearance opposite Melber in late March , the day after Attorney General Barr issued his deceptively exculpatory summary of the then-confidential Mueller Report.
It was nearly 12 minutes of intense bickering—an eternity in cable television. When Sekulow repeatedly talked over the host, Melber flashed a tooth-baring grin, less an affable smile than an animal threat-gesture, and upbraided his guest for filibustering.
“Jay, I know we’re both lawyers, I’m gonna finish the question and then let you answer, all right?”
When Sekulow again interrupted a question—concerning Barr’s revelation that the Mueller Report didn’t “exonerate” Trump—Melber scolded: “Let’s keep this pleasant.”
After more bickering, Melber said, “I’m not trying to get you, Jay,” and Sekulow retorted, “With due respect, I do watch your show” and complained that Melber was purposely underplaying the important legal distinctions between an independent counsel such as Ken Starr (who reported to a panel of judges) and a special counsel such as Mueller (who answers to the attorney general).
Sekulow added: “You conflated the independent counsel with the special counsel and you conveniently leave off [in Melber’s report of Barr’s summary] where it says ‘we’re not accusing the president of a crime.’”
“Jay, Jay, Jay, save the media criticism for when we’re not doing the interview,” a clearly annoyed Melber responded, adding that he had just presented the entire quote prominently onscreen. “So what you just said was inaccurate, and I’ll leave it at that… I’m not gonna do a Trump media debate with you, Jay… We deal with context here.”
Weeks later, in his office, Melber reflected: “I’m thrilled to have the president’s lawyer on. I’m not telling you anything you don’t know, but there are plenty of people watching any channel who might say ‘That’s not the first person I want to hear from now that Mueller’s finished. I want to know other stuff.’”
More Republican fandom comes Melber's way from the decidedly nerdy Bill Kristol , a longtime GOP operative and political theorist, and frequent guest on The Beat (occasionally alongside hip-hop artists such as rapper Fat Joe , to comic effect). “He is the only MSNBC host who delivers the news without the network’s signature smirk.”
Kristol called Melber, in a text message, “a good host—substantive on the legal issues, [and he] asks focused questions.” Melber’s program, meanwhile, contains “more analysis [ and] less opining than most shows,” he added.
Even Ann Coulter, who has claimed to be an obsessive viewer of MSNBC, her favorite cable outlet to hate-watch, can find something positive to say: “He is the only MSNBC host who delivers the news without the network’s signature smirk. (whatever you want to say about fox, they aren’t smirkers.),” she emailed. “I haven’t watched much recently because the entire network seems to have become Soviet State Propaganda.”
Of course, Kristol, these days editor-at-large of The Bulwark , a publication that values traditional institutions and conservative positions that the president regularly derides, is a vocal Never-Trumper. And Coulter, formerly one of the president’s more prominent boosters, has become one of Trump’s harshest critics over his failure keep his most oft-repeated campaign promise and build that wall on the border with Mexico.
They [Trump’s minions] are not there to make my audience feel entertained or excited or informed,” Melber told The Daily Beast.
Two heavy binders containing a generously tabbed copy of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s redacted 448-page report lay on the coffee table in front of Melber as we spoke in his office. “They‘re not there just because they want to talk to me—they could do that off-air. They’re there because they think this forum is fair enough that they can get their views out.”
They are, of course, appearing on a cable outlet that is succeeding largely by stressing a storyline in which the former reality television star is unfit to be president, is probably guilty of corruption and criminal misconduct in the White House, and deserves to be impeached and removed—thus attracting a like-minded viewership of millions (an average of 1.6 million daily for Melber’s show).
“In times of crisis, people reach more for the values and institutions that might help,” Melber said. “So for a large part of the country it’s obvious that Donald Trump reflects a crisis. For another part of the country,” he added, “there’s clearly a lot of excitement about him disrupting and openly attacking norms and institutions that they might not hold in high regard to begin with.”
The Beat inspired headlines in January when Melber devoted an entire show to a panel of Trump supporters and ex-advisers (Carter Page, Michael Caputo, Sam Nunberg and Jerome Corsi) who’d been interrogated by the Mueller prosecutors—with the newsmaking takeaway that the investigation was increasingly focusing on Roger Stone.
Melber said he was especially pleased when former independent counsel Kenneth Starr, a conservative Republican loyalist best known as Bill Clinton’s tormentor who exposed the 42nd president’s fling with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, agreed to appear on The Beat late last year to discuss Trump’s potential legal exposure and the possibility of an impeachment proceeding.
A photo of a somber-looking Melber and a wildly grinning Starr, commemorating the TV lovefest, hangs just outside Melber’s office.
“Ken Starr is a great guest,” he said. “We want everyone who’s credible and can bring something to the table to be on… It’s not in contrast to whatever else is on this channel—that would be too media-centric.” (Melber is proud that Starr’s appearance was especially successful online; Melber’s interview last year with one of his rap-music idols, 50 Cent , also attracted impressive online traffic.)
With his background as an attorney (practicing First Amendment law under famed Cahill Gordon & Reindel litigator Floyd Abrams from 2009 to 2013) and as a political journalist (writing for publications ranging from The Nation to The Atlantic to The Daily Beast ), Melber arguably is perfectly positioned to chronicle the ongoing drama of “whether law and journalism will act as guardrails against someone who openly touts himself as an enemy of the press, of fact-checkers, and of the scientific and empirical process of truth,” as he put it.
The 45th president, Melber continued, also touts himself “as an enemy of judges whom he castigates unfairly, including based on their race, and the enemy of a judicial system that requires truthful cooperation, when he says ‘Be strong,’ ‘Don’t be a rat,’ ‘Don’t tell the truth.’ But then you find out, after all that, that the good news—the whole first part of the Mueller Report—is that they didn’t criminally conspire with Russia.”
MSNBC's biggest star, Rachel Maddow , has been criticized by some for pushing the speculative narrative that Trump and his presidential campaign actively collaborated with Russian political saboteurs—a notion that the Mueller Report (and notably Attorney General William Barr’s 4-page summary of it) seems, at least for now, to have debunked, prompting a temporary MSNBC ratings slide . “The theory of the show is we’re gonna give you the evidence and we’re gonna tell you some things whether you want to hear them or not.”
Melber, by contrast, prides himself on spotlighting “witnesses and evidence, as opposed to doing hypotheticals and speculation or anything else, or bringing only a certain view to it,” he said, careful not to cite any of his MSNBC co-anchors.
Regarding the Mueller investigation, “we felt that our approach—focusing on witnesses regardless of whether you like them and following what you could glean about the probe—was really vindicated,” Melber declared. “The theory of the show is we’re gonna give you the evidence and we’re gonna tell you some things whether you want to hear them or not.”
The Beat ’s videos get around 13 million viewers per month on YouTube—the highest of any MSNBC show, according to a network spokesperson. Melber explained his efforts to feature political figures who might otherwise not be favorites of MSNBC’s core audience this way: “People didn’t know they wanted to eat raw fish either. Now it’s in every airport in America.”
In another counterintuitive instance, in 2017, after Trump issued his executive order banning travelers from predominantly Muslim countries, Melber recalled, “I told my viewers, ‘There’s what you think about this’—a candidate openly running on religious discrimination would horrify The Founders. ‘Then there’s the thing that you don’t like’—I said from the start that, according to precedent, this will likely be upheld…The Supreme Court has said that other than war-making, immigration is one of the president’s highest powers.” (Indeed, the high court’s nine justices narrowly upheld the travel ban in June 2018.)
“Ari is terrific. He’s one of the best legal minds on television. He’s also got his finger on the pulse of today’s culture. That’s why our audience has responded to him in a such a positive way,” MSNBC president Phil Griffin told The Daily Beast in a statement. It’s a predictable encomium given that Melber, since The Beat launched in July 2017, has prospered in a previously troubled time slot that had never before gained traction in the channel’s 23-year history.
Floyd Abrams, for his part, told The Daily Beast that Melber “worked with me on a number of First Amendment matters, always with the greatest skill and creativity. From his first days at Cahill Gordon to the time he moved on to MSNBC, Ari could quickly get to the heart of whatever legal issue we were working on and set forth our position with clarity and persuasiveness.”
Calling Melber “a great guy,” one of Abrams’ more famous clients—Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter James Risen —recalled that when the Obama Justice Department was threatening him with jail unless he identified a confidential source, Melber “was always very supportive of my stance to refuse to reveal my sources and for the cause of press freedom.”
Melber grew up in central Seattle, the younger of two boys, in a highly educated household. His mother is a sociologist who received her doctorate from the University of Chicago, taught at the University of Washington and Boston University, and later worked for a non-profit; his Israeli-born father is a neurologist whose parents fled Germany for Jerusalem as the Nazi regime began persecuting, and ultimately murdering, millions of Jews. Many of their blood-relatives were among the victims.
Being the grandson of Holocaust survivors has clearly informed Melber’s worldview, although he cautioned: “Part of what my job requires is not importing every personal thought or experience to the fairness and evidence in covering a story.”
On the other hand, “we’re human beings and our humanity is part of what makes us—hopefully—good at understanding what other people are doing,” Melber added. “I’m sure my family’s history and identity as minorities—and if you go back far enough, as persecuted minorities—definitely informed my view of a lot of social issues and thinking about the difference between what the majority, or the mob, might say at any given time, and the rights of the minority, the rights of the accused, the rights of all sorts of individuals.
“We’re talking right after Passover. I’m not super-observant, and I don’t quote a lot of the Torah, but Passover can look like a holiday that includes a lot of exploration of humanitarian principles—like you should love the stranger, that children should have a chance, and that you can migrate for a better life.” “I felt helpless because of the way the system was set up. I thought I’m not cut out for this. And it smelled like piss.”
Yet Melber, while doing a summer internship at the New York County public defenders office during his time at Cornell Law School, discovered that his capacity for altruism is limited.
“I didn’t have the emotional grit and toughness and I found it really sad,” Melber said, describing waking up depressed every morning to attend the arraignments of indigent clients who were pressed to plead guilty in order to keep a massive bureaucratic machine running smoothly. “I felt helpless because of the way the system was set up. I thought I’m not cut out for this. And it smelled like piss.”
After graduating in political science from the University of Michigan and gaining hands-on policy and political experience with Cantwell and Kerry, Melber began writing about politics and appearing on cable as a telegenic pundit.
His TV career was launched in earnest in 2013, when MSNBC recruited him to be a regular on The Cycle , a short-lived afternoon panel show; Melber soon was pressed into service as a regular substitute host for vacationing prime-time anchors such as Maddow and Lawrence O’Donnell.
He is divorced after a brief marriage—to Collider journalist Drew Grant—and declines to reveal if he’s dating anyone in particular, except to say, “I’m a happy guy.”
Melber dates his attraction to television to a moment when he was a precocious third-grader performing in the elementary school talent show, when he wrote a playlet about prosecuting Exxon for the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska and cast himself as the star.
“I cast myself as the lead prosecutor, and I had actual props like a fish covered in oil, and I wrote it,” he recalled. “No spoilers here, but I won the case. I think I always had an interest in performing, but also for a purpose and meaning. When I look back, I think it was sort of me, from a young age, wanting to be out front. But I also wanted it to be a mission, with the idea of holding Exxon accountable.”
Now Melber wants to be out front holding Trump and his minions accountable. His Wednesday program, for instance, featured a lengthy excoriation of Bill Barr for willfully misleading the American people and failing in his duty as attorney general to uphold the law. “The most important thing about Donald Trump to Americans’ lives is not my opinion of him. And the most interesting thing about Donald Trump to people’s lives will almost never be my opinion of him… What’s important and what’s interesting is actually revealing what’s happening.”
“It is an unshakeable political fact of this era that the resistance to Donald Trump has been larger than the support for Donald Trump from his first day in office,” Melber said in his office. “That is a peculiarity of our electoral constitutional system that’s not likely to change soon. So it’s not just that he’s all these other things, it’s also that he didn’t win most voters and try to reach out them. He didn’t win most voters and then doubled down on his relatively small base…”
“The most important thing about Donald Trump to Americans’ lives is not my opinion of him,” he cautioned. “And the most interesting thing about Donald Trump to people’s lives will almost never be my opinion of him…What’s important and what’s interesting is actually revealing what’s happening. And there’s no doubt that this is one of the greatest, most fascinating and most stressful stories that America has experienced in the television age.”
With his palpable ambition and appetite for performing—on the day that the Mueller Report was released last week, he spent a dozen hours in front of various NBC and MSNBC cameras—Melber himself seems bound for a larger role in the television age, whether at MSNBC or elsewhere.
For the moment, the epic legal and political story of the Trump presidency—with court fights over subpoenas, televised House hearings and possible impeachment proceedings—will keep Melber busy on The Beat .
“There’s a little something for everyone here,” he said. “The true nature of Trump has to be covered, scrutinized and exposed. But I don’t feel that we need to be at 11 to do our work.”"
New Hampshire GOP Tries to Block Some College Kids From Voting in 2020,www.thedailybeast.com,Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com (Sam Brodey),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/new-hampshire-gop-tries-to-block-some-college-kids-from-voting-in-2020,"VOTING SLIGHTS New Hampshire GOP Tries to Block Some College Kids From Voting in 2020 ‘Starting in July, it’s going to be very difficult for students to cast their ballot,’ said a Dartmouth student and New Hampshire state legislator. 04.26.19 4:57 AM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty
On Tuesday, students packed into an auditorium at Dartmouth College for a town hall event with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), as she traveled through New Hampshire to pitch voters on her campaign for president.
Garrett Muscatel, a 20-year old Dartmouth student who also happens to be a New Hampshire state legislator, introduced Harris at the event. Afterward, as his classmates filed out, he spoke to The Daily Beast and pointed out a problem: only himself and “a couple out of everyone who’s here” will end up voting in the state’s pivotal first-in-the-nation primary.
“Because the Republicans passed legislation to make it so that college students couldn’t vote without paying a poll tax, ” he explained.
The law in question imposes new burdens on voting for residents who hail from out of state and has been at the center of political debate in New Hampshire since it was signed into law last year by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu. With the 2020 primary heading into full swing, the law is now drawing national attention for how it could impact access to the polls for a significant voting bloc—college students—in a politically significant state.
On Monday, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), sent a letter to all the presidential candidates calling on them to condemn the law. At least eight of them did so promptly. At a CNN town hall in Manchester on Monday night, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) blasted the “cowardly” Republican governors pushing laws making it more difficult for young people to vote. “Students are the ones who will have to deal with the decisions lawmakers make for decades to come,” tweeted Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who is making frequent visits to New Hampshire. “Protecting their right to vote is paramount.”
In the past, prospective voters in New Hampshire only had to prove that they lived somewhere in the state to be eligible to vote. The legislation, referred to in New Hampshire by its legislative shorthand, H.B. 1264, establishes more stringent residency requirements, requiring prospective voters to get a state driver’s license and car registration if they want to vote in New Hampshire.
Under the new law, to vote without taking those steps warrants a misdemeanor charge. The law is set to take effect in July.
Muscatel, the student state legislator, ran for office 2018 with a focus on voting rights. Originally from California and now a New Hampshire resident, he described what it would take for out-of-state college students like him to vote without running afoul of the new law: a 40-minute drive to the nearest DMV, $50 to apply for a license, up to $300 to register your car if you own one.
“Starting in July,” Muscatel says, “it’s going to be very difficult for students to cast their ballot.”
The voting rights fight over H.B. 1264 is the latest one sparked by New Hampshire Republicans, who pushed a similar bill in 2017 that threatened $5,000 fines if voters’ registration information was incorrect.
The GOP has argued that the state needs to tighten up its voting requirements. Previously, New Hampshire was the last state in the country not to have some kind of permanent residency requirement to vote; Sununu has argued that H.B. 1264 is a common-sense measure that strengthens the integrity of the state’s elections.
Speaking in January with Howie Carr, a widely-listened conservative talk radio host in New England, the governor declared, “We took care of it.”
“We quote unquote fixed the problem. Closed the loophole. Got some certainty back into our system. And when you're the first in the nation primary, there's a real responsibility to have a system with integrity.”
But states define residency in different ways—and only some states, such as California, link voting to motor vehicle laws, like H.B. 1264 proposes doing.
But, according to Paul Twomey, a veteran New Hampshire election lawyer, “no state ever changed its motor vehicle regulations for the sole purpose of keeping a discrete group of people from voting.”
Beyond that, longstanding claims about voter fraud in New Hampshire have cast Republicans’ arguments about election integrity in a more political light. Rumors of widespread voter fraud in the state got a massive amplification from President Donald Trump, who has fixated on the idea that busloads of people came in from neighboring states in the 2016 election to swing New Hampshire for Hillary Clinton by just 3,000 votes. Fact-checkers, along with the Democratic secretary of state, have not found any evidence for this claim.
In another appearance with Carr, himself a Trump pal, Sununu said that the president raises the specter of voter fraud in New Hampshire every time he sees him. The governor told Carr that without the Democratic votes from college towns, “then Trump and [former Sen. Kelly] Ayotte win by a landslide. Yeah. It’s not even close.”
To Democrats, this comment lays bare Republicans’ true intentions: discouraging a reliably left-leaning voting bloc from going to the polls. College students account for roughly 90,000 of the state’s 1.2 million residents; even at the University of New Hampshire, the state’s largest university and its flagship public institution, half of all students come from out of state.
Lucas Meyer, president of the New Hampshire Young Democrats, says there are still fundamental questions about how the state will enforce the new law.
“It’s confusing and complicated, which I think is the point,” Meyer told The Daily Beast. “These election law changes get dropped in at the state house, and then regardless of what the intent of the bill was, we hear from students on campus who now think ‘oh, I can’t vote’, so we have to be diligent about continuing to educate students on their constitutionally protected right to vote.""
There are several challenges to the new law, casting some doubt over whether it will be on the books when New Hampshire votes next year. Bills to repeal it, or carve out an exception for college students in the new residency requirements, could earn passage out of the Democrat-held state legislature. Most believe Sununu will veto those bills, leaving it up to the courts to decide whether the law violates voting rights.
Last year, the state Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law on a 3-2 vote, with the majority arguing it simply forced people to choose between voting in another state or voting in New Hampshire and meeting state residency requirements. But the American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against the state on behalf of two Dartmouth students, claiming HB 1264 is unconstitutional.
No matter what ultimately happens in court, the chilling effects of the law on voter participation in New Hampshire are already on display as presidential candidates travel through the state, courting young voters who might cast a ballot somewhere else.
In the audience for Harris’ town hall at Keene State College on Tuesday was Nathaniel Jarvie, a 20-year old student originally from Connecticut. He went back to Connecticut to vote for the 2018 elections, and said he’d probably do so again in 2020 to avoid confusion or penalties.
“I’d be more tempted to vote here,” he said, “if they got rid of the stupid law.”"

After a shift, what is your favorite guilty pleasure to eat? “I have some places to get grub around where I live. Dollar slices of pizza, pad thai, Subway or a bodega sando. But recently, I’ve been trying not to eat much after work to trim the fat. That being said, my GM bought me these Thai Coconut M&M’s recently—they’re quite fun and quirky.”
Is there one dish you won’t cook? “This might be an offbeat answer to your question, but my grandmother used to brew this ultra-black herbal drink/soup for me while I was growing up in Singapore, and it’s probably the weirdest concoction I’ve ever tasted in my life. I’ve never known what was in that potent liquid, and I can only remember her coaxing me and forcing the glass to my face, constantly telling me, ‘it’s good for you, it’s good for you, drink it!’”
All-time favorite spice. “White pepper is a re-discovery for me as a chef, but it’s used in some of my favorite dishes back in Singapore. You use an obscene amount of white pepper to cook a pork rib soup called Bak Kut Teh, and it’s the white version that has no soy sauce. It’s very light, super refreshing and spicy—it’s great to get when you want to clear nasal congestion.”
What is your favorite music to listen to while you cook? “My American friends jab jokes at me for listening to an entire spectrum of ‘outdated music,’ which I love and embrace. It goes from Frank Sinatra to the Red Hot Chili Peppers to Fuel to Savage Garden to Craig David, it’s all over the place. I think I got into a vicious cycle of listening to the same stuff forever.”
Did you grow up cooking as a child? “I did not grow up being overly curious about food. My grandmother would chase me out of the kitchen when I tried to poke around her business. However, I did grow up loving food, and eating out is a huge part of the culture in Singapore, and the diversity of food available is one of her beauties.”
What cookbook is your go-to resource for inspiration? “There are many sources for inspiration in today’s social media climate. It’s so much easier to see what others are doing on Instagram nowadays, especially with geo-tags and hashtags factored in. It’s not too hard to get sucked into a rabbit hole of oblivion. I remember there was a time when I did not have the luxury of space and money to buy books, and I would go to the Barnes & Noble in Union Square in NYC to browse new cookbooks, and it was a great way to briefly check out five different books in a short period of time.”
After all these years working in restaurants, do you still enjoy going out to eat? “I believe most chefs get into the restaurant business stemming from some very primitive and visceral feelings within themselves, and part of it for me is the enjoyment of eating and sharing that same enjoyment with others. That might sound very corny but it’s true for myself. As a younger cook, I used to be so obsessed with the details of the dishes and service and would have fun picking it apart and making sense of it all. Nowadays, I’ve learned how to live in the moment, enjoy the company of others and just let loose and ebb with the flow of the night.”
Is there one chef you’d like to cook with? “This is tough since there are countless chefs out there that I look up to. But it has to be between Seiji Yamamoto of Nihonryori RyuGin in Tokyo and Corey Lee of Benu in San Francisco. I’ve had a meal in both places and was utterly floored with the level of precision, execution and commitment to cuisine.”
Name the all-time best cooking show. “I think this is not a very popular show in the U.S., or I’ve been asking the wrong people because very few of my chef friends know what I am talking about. I grew up in Singapore watching Yan Can Cook with Martin Yan. He’s always able to captivate a live audience with his ways. I’ll always remember the phrase, ‘If Yan can Cook, so can You!’”
What is the one tool that you always make sure to pack when you’re traveling for business? “Other than the obvious tools, I am trying to get better with planning and delegation, so either a notebook or a clipboard to hold loose sheets of paper that I can scribble notes on, and printouts of information.”
Max Ng is executive chef of Momofuku Ssäm Bar in New York’s East Village. He’s a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America.

Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.’ Joseph Longo 04.26.19 7:09 AM ET
A lexander Summerfield received some terrible news at the beginning of the month: It’s the longest ever wait for a Rihanna album. The Barbadian icon released her first seven albums in eights years before a three-year pause let up by 2016’s Anti . The start of April marked three years and two months since Anti .
The day Summerfield heard of the unwanted milestone, Rihanna had posted a glamour shot for her new Fenty bronzer on Instagram . Summerfield wasn’t feeling so warm, angrily commenting, “I don’t give a fuck how many people think I’m crazy for saying this. YOU. SAID. WE WOULDN’T. HAVE. TO. WAIT. AS. LONG. AS. WE. DID. FOR. ANTI. I love u sis but get it TOGETHER,” he said in part.
Reflecting on his impassioned plea weeks later, Summerfield, who runs the popular fan art account @navyukedits , admits he “probably should have written it out before posting.” But he doesn’t regret his tone: “The shade in my comments tends to be what draws people to liking it.” Sure enough, his comment racked up 109 likes.
As a member of the Rihanna Navy , Summerfield is well-versed in stan culture. But for the past few years, social media fandoms have largely come under attack for vicious hate. Pete Davidson received death threats by Arianators after his breakup with Ariana Grande, while the Barbz had writer Wanna Thompson fired from her KarenCivil.com internship for critiquing Nicki Minaj. Lady Gaga’s Little Monsters even tried to sabotage A Star is Born ’s box-office competitor Venom with fake reviews.
Now some fierce fandoms are starting to turn on their own idols. With artists like Rihanna, Lana Del Rey and The Weeknd on extended music hiatuses, their stans used to following their every move are at a standstill. False promises, delayed release dates and little acknowledgment by their idols have left many demanding new music. With no signs they’ll get their wish, many stans have decided to do what they know best: attack.
“U were my first love you fckn loser drop an album i’m fckn BORED,” Nae, an 18-year-old from Toronto, tweeted last October to The Weeknd. She grew up on the R&B singer’s albums, joining his XO Crew and routinely attended his concerts. It was all worth it when “at one point he’d followed me on Twitter.” Now that The Weeknd is taking his time to release new music—he hasn’t released an album since his 2016’s Starboy —part of Nae’s identity is threatened.
“I get upset about it, ya, but to say I feel like anyone owes me anything—no,” she said. “If you follow an artist closely and their music is important to you, then after waiting for awhile you get restless.”
Part of the frustration is if there’s not music then there’s little keeping the community together. “When your fav is releasing music/music videos, doing tv appearances/interviews, it’s more fun to be on stan Twitter,” Kwasi, a 23-year-old Kesha stan said over Twitter DM.
Kesha’s fans patiently supported the nearly five-year wait for her most recent album Rainbow , whose release was initially stalled amid her ongoing legal battle with producer and alleged abuser Dr. Luke . When Rainbow finally dropped in 2017, her fans were floored. For nearly two years, they’ve celebrated her first Grammy nominations, tour with Macklemore and signature boat cruise . Now her Animals want new music, and this time Kwasi and others aren’t willing to wait as long. “Right now it’s radio silence on her end, which is incredibly tough for her fans,” he said. “To see her go from being so active and present to only posting ads and automated posts is a little frustrating.” “ A common theme emerged in my interviews with passionate stans: almost everyone who commented something that could be perceived as aggressive said there are accounts who’ve said something worse. ”
So they bombard her about the status of her music on social media. Some are light-hearted takes on popular memes, others are sincere questions. But increasingly they’ve become aggressive. “There’s no drama...no new music...no new pics/interviews bitch I’m BORED,” Kwasi tweeted in March. Kwasi defended his tweet, saying, “I went on to reiterate that nothing was happening and added a funny gif. I don’t see how that is rude or even close to bullying?”
A common theme emerged in my interviews with passionate stans: almost everyone who commented something that could be perceived as aggressive said there are accounts who’ve said something worse. A fan of the alt-pop singer Banks who’d commented on her Instagram “with all due respect, queen...where is the album, we need the damn album,” told me over Instagram DM they wouldn’t be a useful source because “I’m not one of THOSE stans”—they, of course, are referring to “Rihanna’s stans who won’t let her breathe without asking for her album.”
The Rihanna Navy certainly has one of the worst reputations for nastiness. While Nicki Minaj’s Barbz viciously attack her adversaries , the Navy isn’t afraid to sink their own idol’s ship. On April 10, Rihanna posted a tribute video on Instagram to late rapper Nipsey Hussle and his partner, actress Lauren London. In a now-deleted comment, Ajit, a 20-year-old stan from Nepal behind the account @RihannaNepal , demanded to know when her next Fenty Beauty line—not even her music—would be released. “When I first saw the tweet, I didn’t know about Nipsey,” Ajit said. “So I was trolling her. Then I realized it is related to him. It’s already been deleted.”
Summerfield, who admits he’s prone to comment when “in a bad mood,” defended the Navy. Rihanna herself will occasionally respond to the never-ending comments with quippy retorts, including one hilarious meme . “She acts shady, so her fans act shady,” he said.
However well-intentioned stans may be, it’s not always appreciated by their idols. Justin Bieber recently addressed his fans demanding new music in a lengthy Instagram caption. “Music is very important to me but Nothing comes before my family and my health,” he said. Similarly, Cardi B, after having just given birth to daughter Kulture Kiari, responded “It’s coming sis hold on just a damn minute” to a fan on Twitter requesting new music a mere four months after she dropped Invasion of Privacy .
So why do fans so devoted to their idols turn on them? “They’re entitled to the artists on music releases and what deals they have,” said Will Cosme of the mega-popular watchdog Twitter account Pop Crave . Fans can make or break an artist’s project, such as BTS’ Army and Blackpink’s Blinks helping K-Pop groups unprecedently thrive stateside. So when an artist like Rihanna decides to focus on her beauty line or acting career, the Navy may “feel kind of abandoned,” Cosme said.
It certainly backfired for Katy Perry. In 2017, Perry traded her long, sleek black hair for a short, bleach blonde cut as part of her Witness album era. “I so badly want to be Katheryn Hudson that I don’t even want to look like Katy Perry anymore sometimes,” she told Viceland . Witness was largely a critical failure, causing bouts of “situational depression” for Perry. Her fans have turned the blame back onto her and her hair.
“Katy perry trending on US apple music just from applying a wig...you possibly can’t tell me that her short hair is not the reason why people stopped bumping her,” one Katy Perry stan tweeted . Sure enough, Perry’s debut of a long blonde wig on Instagram last week is believed to be her most-liked photo ever .
With no new music updates from their favorite artists, many stans are shifting their focus. Summerfield now draws portraits of Lana Del Rey, Ariana Grande and Beyonce. “I just don’t think she’s choosing to do it. Which is fine, but three years. Is that really beneficial to us?

After her inaugural Not The White House Correspondents’ Dinner in 2017, she vowed never to host such an event again—but then, the President shut down the government, said there were ""very fine"" people on both sides, and treated a champion football team to a spread of “great American food.” And to hold him accountable, the White House Correspondents' Association hired a historian to host their annual dinner, breaking the more than thirty-year-old tradition of hiring a comedian for the gig.
So, Samantha Bee and her team decided to head back to D.C. to give the President the roast he deserves. This time she’s including special guests, surprise performances, and technological advances to dazzle and terrify us all into a rallying around all parts of the First Amendment.

FBI Director Christopher Wray Says Russia Remains a Threat to 2020 Election,www.thedailybeast.com,Erin.Banco@thedailybeast.com (Erin Banco),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/fbi-director-christopher-wray-says-russia-remains-a-threat-to-2020-election,"ALWAYS WATCHING FBI Director Christopher Wray Says Russia Remains a Threat to 2020 Election ‘That’s not just in an election cycle threat. It is pretty much a 365 day a year threat,’ Wray said. 04.26.19 10:39 AM ET Shutterstock
FBI Director Chris Wray on Friday said Russia still poses a significant counterintelligence threat to the U.S. and continues to use social media campaigns to try and influence American politics.
“They use social media … to try and spin us up and pit us against each other and to undermine Americans faith in democracy,” Wray said at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. “That’s not just in an election cycle threat. It is pretty much a 365 day a year threat.”
Wray said Russia used those tactics in the 2018 midterms but that his agency saw “no material impact on election infrastructure or campaign infrastructure” during the election.
Wray’s appearance at CFR comes just two weeks after the release of the Mueller report, which outlined in detail the way Russian used cyber tactics to meddle in the 2016 election, and days after news broke that the White House ignored efforts by national security officials to focus on the threat Russia poses to U.S. elections.
Russian cyber intrusion has dominated the conversation among U.S. intelligence officials particularly in the wake of reports that the Department of Homeland Security cut back its task force that protect elections from foreign meddling. But Wray said the FBI is still concerned about Russian meddling in the upcoming 2020 presidential election with social media campaigns, which he described as the “big show”, and is actively working to monitoring all cyber threats.
Beyond the threats Russia poses to American elections, Wray said, the FBI was increasingly focused on the threats posed by China, especially in regard to its attempts to get its hands on American technology and innovation.
“No country poses a broader threat ….than China,” Wray said, adding that there are ongoing investigations in the FBI that lead back to China and span “every industry and sector.”
“[China’s behavior] goes way beyond fair market competition,” Wray said. “This is behavior that violates the rule of law. They have a formal plan in 5 year incriminates … weaving together things like foreign investment together with cyber intrusions and supply chain threats. They’re calculating, they’re focused and they’re persistent.”
Wray’s comments echo those made by President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who have both said publicly that countering China is a top national security focus of the Trump administration. The U.S. has ratcheted up its rhetoric against China particularly in the last six months and has used its competition with Beijing to contextualize its bids for international deals, including the potential for a Saudi nuclear agreement.
“The theft of American intellectual property is a big business [for China] to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars and President Trump is determined to push back against it,” Pompeo said in a recent CBS News interview.
In January, Wray testified with other top intelligence officials behind in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee about their worldwide threat assessment -- a summary of the most critical national security threats facing the U.S. The briefing did not mention threats posed on the southern border.
On Friday in Washington, Wray similarly did not raise the issue of the southern border but when asked said that the threat “is something that needs to be taken extremely seriously.”
Wray did say that the agency was focusing on the rise of domestic terrorism. Echoing his comments from his testimony earlier this month on the FBI’s 2020 budget, Wray said there are “steady and persistent threat across all different types of domestic terrorism”, including white supremacy."

Morning Joe ’s Mika Brzezinski became emotional Friday while discussing the release of a Coast Guard lieutenant accused of threatening her husband and co-host, Joe Scarborough.
Christopher Hasson, 50 and a self-proclaimed white nationalist, has been hit with firearms and drug charges , but—despite his alleged ownership of a hit list of prominent Democrats, Supreme Court justices, TV journalists, and social-media executives—he hasn’t been charged with any terrorism-related offenses .
Prosecutors say authorities found 15 guns and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition at Hasson’s Maryland home in February.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Charles Day said Thursday that he had “grave concerns” about Hasson based on the evidence and noted that he will have “a whole lot of supervision” before his release before his eventual trial.
“What concerns me is he’s targeted Pelosi; he’s targeted Schumer,” Scarborough said Morning Joe. “He’s targeted all Democratic senators that have decided they’re going to run against Trump. And he’s targeted people in the media who have been seen as critics of Trump.”
Hasson’s purported hit list included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Democratic Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. It also included two unnamed Supreme Court justices, Scarborough and Chris Hayes of MSNBC, and Chris Cuomo and Van Jones of CNN.
“The defendant conducted an internet search for ‘are supreme court justices protected’ approximately two weeks prior to searching for the home addresses of the two Supreme Court justices,” according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Windom .
Brzezinski said she didn’t understand how any judge could let Hasson walk out of jail.
“Why? How could this be?” she asked. “These are the things you find after a massacre. And you go, ‘Oh, these were the warning signs, we should’ve noticed them!’ So the warning signs are right there.”
“And I say this as the wife of someone who was on that list,” Brzezinski continued. “So you may hear a little intensity in my voice. But I think Trump’s doing this. How can I not do that math in my mind that the attorney general is making a clear decision here to make sure the lives of people who are being targeted continue to be in danger because they will not put together the pieces of this case? A stockpile of weapons, a list of people that he wants to kill. Are you serious? There’s no way not to let this guy walk? You’ve got to be kidding me.”
Scarborough added: “If somebody threatens the president of the United States, they’re thrown in jail. If this guy had put the president of the United States on his kill list, instead of the speaker of the House and the Senate minority leader and Democratic presidential candidates, that person would be in jail, and that person would stay in jail.”
“Who in the hell would look at this manifesto and say, ‘Hey I don’t know this might be a tough case, I don’t know if we want to move it forward or not.’ Who would do that?” he added."

A Fox News reporter on Thursday called out two of his colleagues for sounding “like a White Supremacist chat room” when they attempted to defend President Trump’s infamous “both sides” comment about white supremacists in Charlottesville, according to internal emails reviewed by The Daily Beast.
Shortly after former Vice President Joe Biden launched his 2020 presidential campaign with a video bashing Trump’s comments that there were “good people on both sides” at the deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally, general assignment reporter Doug McKelway sprang into action to defend the president.
McKelway, a nine-year Fox News veteran, sent an email to dozens of network employees, saying he was “Putting this Biden statement out there, next to Trump’s original presser, and a live interview I did in C-ville with ‘good people on both sides’” to supposedly fact-check Biden. The emails were first published by FTV Live.
McKelway began his email with a Winston Churchill quote: “A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.” He then proceeded to echo the pro-Trump claim that the president never said what he said about the neo-Nazis who marched at the deadly event.
McKelway contrasted portions of Biden’s script against the same quotes that pro-Trump outlets have used to claim the president never defended white nationalists. And then the reporter highlighted a quote from his own interview with Brian Lambert, an armed Unite the Right attendee, who portrayed the neo-Nazi rallygoers as victims: “They’re denying people their right to assemble. They’re denying their right to speak freely, however hateful their views may be,” he bemoaned.
Moments later, Fox News digital senior editor Cody Derespina replied-all, agreeing with McKelway, and adding to it a snippet of a Fox News interview with Jarrod Kuhn, a Charlottesville marcher who claimed he was not a white supremacist, but simply there to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee.
Within minutes of that email, Fox News Radio’s White House correspondent Jon Decker stepped in to chastise his colleagues.
“I really don’t understand the point you are making,” he wrote. “Jarrod Kuhn was one of those individuals in Charlottesville holding a tiki torch while the mob chanted ‘Jews will not replace us.’”
An hour later, a seemingly humbled McKelway returned to the thread, walking back his previous words. He linked to an article from C-Ville , a Charlottesville alt-weekly, that showed his one-time interviewee Brian Lambert was, in fact, a white nationalist who trespassed in local parks, removed tarps off Confederate statues, placed rebel flag stickers on surfaces, and flashed a white-power symbol to supporters during his sentencing hearing.
“[I]t appears Lambert revealed himself to be not the squeaky clean 1st amendment supporter he claimed to be on live TV,” McKelway confessed.
“So much for your Winston Churchill quote,” Decker shot back hours later for all to see.
He scolded McKelway for “invoking Churchill to what happened in Charlottesville,” calling it “rather offensive.”
In fact, Decker continued, “Based upon the slew of emails that I’ve received today, both of you should send an apology to your Fox News colleagues—many of whom are hurt and infuriated by your respective posts. Your posts read like something you’d read on a White Supremacist chat room.”
McKelway has a history of questionable comments about the deadly Charlottesville rally. Several days after anti-racism protester Heather Heyer was killed by white nationalist James Alex Fields at the rally, McKelway retweeted one user telling his Fox News colleague Shep Smith to “keep some comments to yourself.”
As it turns out, moments before, when McKelway equivocated on-air to Smith about how all Charlottesville residents—regardless of political beliefs—couldn’t wait for the national media to leave town, Smith replied , “Yeah, they probably can’t wait for the neo-Nazis to leave either.”
When asked for comment on the retweet telling his colleague to shut up, McKelway snarkily offered an autographed picture of himself.
Additionally, prior to the 2016 election, McKelway defended the alt-right on Fox News, claiming it was simply “using the same tactics that the left has used for generations now.” He further asserted that the alt-right is “much more than” an anti-Semitic, white-nationalist movement, citing Milo Yiannopoulos for his efforts in combating “the left’s obsession with... safe spaces.”
And a year before that, McKelway compared the removal of the Confederate flag from South Carolina’s statehouse to the Soviet practice of airbrushing purged dissidents out of official photographs.
And in the aftermath of the deadly Charlottesville rally, several prominent Fox News hosts like Smith did admonish Trump for his “both sides” comment, but plenty of others publicly defended him . Most notably: The Five co-host and Trump booster Jesse Watters said the president was just trying to get “all the facts,” while host and unofficial Trump adviser Sean Hannity asked why the media was not focusing on the “alt-left.”"

About twice a month, the Daily Beast Travel section features some of the best (and most beautiful) coffee table books that focus on travel in a series called Just Booked . We’ve rounded up the eight you should have with you to showcase and appreciate the beauty that is all around you, from brutalist architecture to intricate library ceilings to the most influential maps ever created .
Theater of the World: The Maps That Made History by Thomas Reinertsen Berg, $35 on Amazon: “The book gets its name from Flemish cartographer Abraham Ortelius's atlas Theatrum orbis terrarum (Theater of the World). Like Ortelius, Berg has built upon generations of work and woven it into a digestible dive into everything from cartography to illustration and mapmaking. While not as hefty as some of our past selections, this mid-size book may be the most likely to cause you to lose a guest in its pages.” - Read More Here
California Captured: Mid-Century Modern Architecture by by Emily Bills, Sam Lubell, and Pierluigi Serraino, $31 on Amazon: “One of the best at documenting the explosion of this style in California after World War II was the photographer Marvin Rand. The book overflows with Rand’s gorgeous images capturing the aesthetic in all its simple So Cal glory.” - Read More Here
Art Deco Chicago: Designing Modern America by Robert Bruegmann, $49 on Amazon: “The book is, quite simply, fantastic. It’s a deep dive into not just the explosion in Art Deco architecture, but also its effects in fashion and industrial design.

Alexander von Humboldt and the Botanical Exploration of the Americas by H. Walter Lack, $41 on Amazon: “Lack, a renowned German botanist, fills the pages with a serious (and not always flattering) look at Humboldt’s legacy in science.

The real gems in the book, however, are the richly colored prints of artistic renderings of the plants he documented along the way, as well as photographs of the specimens he retained for study in Europe.” - Read More Here
Battlefields by Yan Morvan, $76 on Amazon: “The book is a compilation of the photojournalist’s work over a decade photographing 238 of history’s most important battlefields—covering everything from the Persian Wars to modern day Libya.

Massimo Listri, The World’s Most Beautiful Libraries Text by Georg Ruppelt & Elisabeth Sladek, $139 on Amazon: “This giant book (roughly 11” x 15” and weighing in at what feels like a dozen pounds) features majestic photographs by Italian photographer Massimo Listri. He focuses mostly on Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, and Neoclassical European libraries and a handful of their descendants in the Americas. (Given how breathtaking Listri’s work is, one hopes there will be a follow-up volume on modern libraries around the globe.) From out-of-the-way phantasmagorical wonders like the libraries of Metten and Ulm to the dramatic Real Gabinete Português de Leitura in Rio de Janeiro, Listri captures these man-made wonders in all their splendor” - Read More Here
Atlas of Brutalist Architecture by Phaidon Editors, $102 on Amazon: “More than 850 of what the editors have deemed the world's finest Brutalist buildings are included. The big names are all there—Breuer, Corbusier, Niemeyer—but so too are ones that aren't as familiar to mainstream audiences like Ernő Goldfinger. So, too, do modern day architects working in the style get a shoutout—Herzog & de Meuron, Jean Nouvel, and, yes, Zaha Hadid.” - Read More Here
Life Along the Hudson: The Historic Country Estates of the Livingston Family by Pieter Estersohn, $58 on Amazon: “Estersohn's photographs are beautiful—capturing each of these historic properties in, literally, their best light.

"Biden Gives Bumbling Apology as ‘The View’ Confronts Him on Creepy Touching, Anita Hill",www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/biden-gives-bumbling-apology-as-the-view-confronts-him-on-creepy-touching-anita-hill,"AWKWARD Biden Gives Bumbling Apology as ‘The View’ Confronts Him on Creepy Touching, Anita Hill ‘Look, I’m really sorry if what I did is talk to them and trying to console that they took it a different way,’ the ex-veep said. 04.26.19 12:50 PM ET The View/ABC
In his first television interview since announcing his run for presiden t, former Vice President Joe Biden found himself sputtering a bit Friday when confronted by The View over multiple allegations of inappropriate touching and his treatment of Anita Hill.
Biden was initially greeted by The View hosts with a very warm welcome by the panel and extremely friendly audience. But the tone shifted halfway through the chat when co-host Sunny Hostin brought up recent accusations from multiple women that he invaded their personal space and made them feel “gross.”
“We’re in a different time now,” Hostin asked. “We’re in the #MeToo movement. Are you sorry for what you did? Are you prepared to apologize to those women?”
The former veep replied that “everybody has to be more away of the private space of men and women” before awkwardly asking the all-woman panel if he can hug them, noting that he wasn’t sure what to do when he walked out.
“It’s tricky,” co-host Joy Behar noted.
Biden then rambled a bit about how it is his responsibility to be “more aware” and how he needs to better read when “this is space no one wants me to invade.” He made sure to note that no one has categorized the allegations as having anything “to do with harassment.”
“They have said that,” Hostin replied. “They have also said they would like an apology.”
“Look, I’m really sorry if what I did is talk to them and trying to console that they took it a different way,” the former vice president replied. “It’s my responsibility to make sure that I bend over backwards to try to understand how not to do that.”
Behar interjected, pointing out that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants him to simply say “I’m sorry,” prompting the ex-veep to grow exasperated, still refusing to issue a clear apology.
“So I invaded your space. I’m sorry this happened,” he huffed. “I’m not sorry in the sense that I think I did anything that was intentionally designed to do anything wrong or be inappropriate. It was inappropriate that I didn’t understand that I took—I assumed—look, I was—anyway.”
After a commercial break, Biden was asked about his call to Anita Hill earlier this month—a call that Hill said left her dissatisfied as she wouldn’t describe it as an apology for his treatment of her during 1991 Senate hearings, in which she alleged sexual harassment by Supreme Court then-nominee Clarence Thomas.
Biden claimed he did everything he could to defeat Thomas’ confirmation while adding that he “believed her from the beginning,” causing the panel to grill him on whether he wanted to “clean this up right now” and directly apologize to her.
Asked why he didn’t reach out to Hill earlier, considering the hearings occurred 28 years ago, Biden said: “Since I had publicly apologized for the way she was treated... I didn’t want to, quote, invade her space.”
“I think she wants you to say I’m sorry for the way I treated you, not for the way you were treated,” Behar shot back. “That might be a littler closer.”
Biden, still unable to unequivocally apologize for his actions, answered: “But I’m sorry the way she got treated. I never heard—if you go back and look at what I said and I didn’t say, I don’t think I treated her badly. I took on her opposition.”
After saying he just was unable to figure out how to stop the inflammatory questions and character assassinations during the hearing, Biden broadly admitted “there were a lot of mistakes made across the board,” and for that he apologized."

This week: All your favorite characters are gonna die. Elizabeth Berkley’s moment. Bow down to Amy Poehler. (Always.) Sophie Turner’s jaw-dropping Thrones review. The Biggest Pop Culture Weekend Ever?
It’s nice to learn a new phrase that will make you cry every time you hear for it. Take, for example, “Arise, Ser Brienne of Tarth, Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.”
Sunday night’s episode was, beyond a doubt, the most emotional Game of Thrones I had ever seen—and therefore also this big ole softie’s favorite. (Less fighting! More existential bonding!)
The entire episode was the Westeros equivalent of that scene at the end of Toy Story 3 where all the toys are heading towards the incinerator, and so they link hands and find comfort and strength in being together with the ones they love as they face certain death and I weep uncontrollably through it all.
The surprisingly tender Sansa-Theon reunion; the Sam, Jon, and Edd pow-wow; Podrick singing that gorgeous song as everyone drank around the fire and contemplated the battle ahead. It was a trip watching these characters we’ve known and loved and sometimes forgotten the names of because, hey, there’s so many of them, seize life, maybe for the last time, in their own peculiar ways. But nothing holds a candle to that beautiful, magnificently acted knighting of Brienne.
Making the whole thing even more monumental is knowing that, yep, Brienne’s definitely going to die this week. I have no inside TV reporter intel on that. That scene just felt like such a swan song and the trailer for Sunday night does not look good for our beloved badass. In fact, it’s not looking good for a lot of fan-favorite characters, both in GoT and in the other big nerd-out event happening this weekend.
A special prayer goes out to spoiler-phobes, who could be facing the most traumatizing Monday morning of their lives this week, what with a surefire body count set for Sunday night’s episode of Game of Thrones and whatever Top Secret nonsense is unfurling in Avengers: Endgame.
Consider it the pop culture apocalypse—the Apopculturelypse?—for those who don’t want to know what happened in TV shows and movies they haven’t had a chance to see yet and which will 100 percent be spoiled for them at work this week.
I mean, a reported 8,000 screenings of Endgame have already sold out this weekend. That number is absurd. It truly speaks to the fact that The Avengers may be the most popular franchise ever and also that this weekend would be a great time to go to the laundromat or try to get a reservation at a crowded restaurant.
As for me? Spoil away! Please, someone tell me who dies in Endgame and save me three hours and $19. (But don’t you dare breathe a word of Thrones secrets.) Justice for Showgirls?
Every once in a while, it’s nice to be reminded that your favorite stars of yesteryear are doing OK! That they seem nice and normal and are going through life just fine. A sigh of relief on that topic came this week when an Instagram surfaced of Saved By the Bell stars Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Tiffani Thiessen, Mario Lopez, and Elizabeth Berkley having dinner together. (Lisa Turtle and Screech were not there, and I do not want to know why because the answer is probably too dark.)
We all like to live in a fantasy world where TV friends we grew up with are still adult friends years later—I believe that freezing time is the one superpower we would all agree is useful—so it’s a special joy when we see that they actually are. The four have somehow weathered decades of career ups and downs and scrutiny and come out alive (no small feat!) with a healthy perspective on those “downs” along the way.
To that point, one of the buzziest and most interesting entries in this year’s Tribeca Film Festival (happening right now in New York) litigates once again perhaps the defining moment in Berkley’s career—caffeine-pill addicted Tina Turner covers notwithstanding. You Don’t Nomi (best name ever?) is a documentary that revisits the notorious flop-turned-cult-classic Showgirls .
This isn’t the first time there has been an attempt to understand how a prestigious director (Paul Verhoeven), a promising cast (Berkley, Kyle MacLachlan, Gina Gershon), and a sexy premise combined into a final product as reviled as this was, but which then grew to become cherished and maybe even appreciated on its own merits.
Is Showgirls more than a “masterpiece of shit,” or a “type of comedy you can’t make on purpose,” the film wonders? Is it actually a stealth masterpiece, bar none? The film revisitis Verhoeven’s other, more celebrated works, and juxtaposes scenes, specific shots, and themes against those routinely mocked from Showgirls to make its argument. Am I ridiculous for being convinced?
Whether you saw Showgirls when it first came out and were offended, watch it every Friday night while it plays on mute at a gay bar in Hell’s Kitchen, or are only familiar with it because of the image results of an Alta Vista search for “sexy nude celebrity” you did with the family filter off on the desktop in the basement 20 years ago, it’s a very worthwhile dissection of a wild movie that became a pop culture phenomenon. Justice for Elizabeth Berkley! We love her! Ramy Should Be Your Next Comedy Binge
As more and more TV options emerge and threaten to suffocate us all, it’s harder to do something that genuinely feels fresh, special, or, perhaps the biggest barrier, actually necessary. That’s what makes Ramy so remarkable.
The comedy series is on Hulu, and does that very rare, admirable thing of telling a story that is deeply personal and specific—something that makes an underseen demographic feel validated and valued—while at the same time being universal, producing something both relatable and illuminating.
Ramy is an occasionally hilarious and routinely fascinating look at a millennial Muslim-American, whose second-generation status introduces a host of impossible-to-navigate tensions and contradictions in his life.
His pursuits—love, sex, friendship, a rewarding job, a good relationship with his parents—are recognizable to the point of exhaustiveness when it comes to auteur, “meaningful” comedies. But Ramy’s identity is inextricable from the experiences he’s going through, and the show isn’t shy about being honest about religion, while at the same time not politicizing it.
The show makes for a great watch. I endorse! (For more on Ramy , listen to Matt Wilstein’s interview with star Ramy Youssef in his The Last Laugh podcast .) Amy Poehler’s Description of Twitter Deserves a Pulitzer
Sometimes when I just think of Amy Poehler, my heart fills with the kind of warm feelings I imagine the rest of you get when you see newborn puppies (ew, they’re loud and they smell). She’s an unrivaled comedic performer, confident in her talent, and candid about how she engages with the world—a manner which, it just so happens, we should all maybe emulate.
In any case, Poehler gave a great interview to The Hollywood Reporter in advance of her new movie Wine Country , which she directed; which co-stars Maya Rudolph, Ana Gasteyer, Rachel Dratch, and Tina Fey; and which will henceforth be referred to as The Avengers: Wine Country .

Paranoid Trump Tells NRA He ‘Caught’ Coup Plotters: ‘I Didn’t Need a Gun’,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/paranoid-trump-tells-nra-he-caught-coup-plotters-i-didnt-need-a-gun,"Paranoid Trump Tells NRA He ‘Caught’ Coup Plotters: ‘I Didn’t Need a Gun’ ‘Spying, surveillance, trying for an overthrow. We caught them,’ he told an enamored gun-rights crowd. 04.26.19 1:09 PM ET Fox News
At National Rifle Association annual meeting on Friday, President Trump trained his fire on Democrats and the Mueller investigation for what he called a failed ‘coup’ attempt—one he boasted of having defeated without a gun.
“They tried for a coup, didn’t work out so well. And I didn’t need a gun for that one, did I?” he said to the Indianapolis crowd. “All was taking place at the highest levels in Washington, D.C. You’ve been watching, you’ve been seeing.”
He continued: “You’ve been looking at things that you wouldn’t have believed possible in our country. Corruption at the highest level. A disgrace. Spying, surveillance, trying for an overthrow. And we caught them. We caught them.”
The speech to the pro-gun group, held at at Lucas Oil Stadium, demonstrated Trump’s view of the NRA as core to his base. He repeatedly emphasized how he is a “champion for the Second Amendment,” and promised to continue to defend “America’s future” from his political enemies.
“America’s future has never been brighter and yet Democrats have never been angrier,” he said. “Especially now that their collusion delusion has been exposed to the world as a complete and total fraud.”
As his fifth consecutive speech to the annual meeting, Trump’s speech marked his need for a continued close relationship with the gun lobby and its activists—who spent more than $30 million in his 2016 election . In turn, Trump has tirelessly pushed for the NRA’s agenda, often rejecting gun reform proposals in the wake of high-profile mass shootings. He used Friday’s speech as a platform to push NRA members to vote in droves.
“Far-left radicals in Congress want to take away your voice, your jobs, your rights, and they especially want to take away your guns. You know that,” he said. “They want to take away your guns. You better get out there and vote.”
The president’s speech seemed to piggyback off Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action spoke, who called for the gun group to unite around Trump while simultaneously warning that Democrats “hate us. They hate our trucks, they hate our plastic straws, and yes, they hate our guns.” He added: “But what they fail to understand is we don’t give a damn what they think.”
Before departing for the Indiana speech, Trump addressed a slew of similar issues on the White House South Lawn, calling out Mueller’s probe into the 2016 election, slamming ex-veep Joe Biden for his age , and doubled down on his 2017 claim there were “very fine people on both sides” at a Charlottesville white-supremacist rally.
In another attempt to clarify those comments, which were highlighted in Biden’s campaign announcement video, Trump responded: “I’ve answered that question and I was talking about people who went because they felt very strongly about the statue of Robert E. Lee. Whether you like it or not, he was one of the great generals.”
Vice President Mike Pence also spoke at the Indianapolis meeting, introducing Trump and solidifying their administration’s “first-day promise” that gun rights will not be touched. “I’ll make you a promise: under this president, and this vice-president, no one is taking your guns,” he said.
“The National Rifle Association stands for freedom,” he said. “It won’t be enough to win the next election. We’ve got to win the next generation.”
The NRA has had a rough few months. The group’s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, fretted in a March fundraising letter that the NRA could shut down “ very soon .” And as The Daily Beast previously reported, the gun-rights org has been caught up in a scandal involving Maria Butina, a Russian national who pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as a covert Kremlin agent. She courted NRA leaders as part of that effort. READ THIS LIST"

"Britney Is Out of Rehab, but That Doesn’t Mean #FreeBritney Is Over",www.thedailybeast.com,tom.sykes@thedailybeast.com (Tom Sykes),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/britney-is-out-of-rehab-but-that-doesnt-mean-freebritney-is-over,"All Is Well? Britney Is Out of Rehab, but That Doesn’t Mean #FreeBritney Is Over A theory that Britney Spears was being held against her will prompted #FreeBritney. Now she is out of the rehab, but don’t expect her fans to drop their campaign. 04.26.19 5:45 AM ET Handout
Britney Spears has checked out of the mental health facility where she has spent the last 30 days.
The 37-year-old singer was collected by her boyfriend, Sam Asghari, whose car travelled back to the pop star’s home in convoy with another vehicle which, according to TMZ, was carrying her stuff .
Britney’s discharge, however, will be unlikely to stem her fans' concerns that she is being unfairly controlled and restricted by the terms of a conservatorship first imposed after she had a very public breakdown in 2007.
The theory was explored in a blog dedicated to the star, Britneysgram . This handy primer on Jezebel details all the twists and turns of the conspiracy theory, which spread across social media like wildfire, generating the #FreeBritney hashtag.
#FreeBritney received celebrity endorsement when Courtney Stodden wore a #FreeBritney tank top and Real Housewives of New York star Luann de Lesseps posted a video on Instagram of her dancing to Spears’ single “Me Against the Music,” with the hashtag.
Further fuel was added to the fire when her former manager, Sam Lufti, commented that a dazed-looking Britney appeared “terrified and aberrant” in photos taken during an outing from the rehab.
Earlier this week, Britney posted a short video clip , which appeared to be filmed in the rehab, in which she denounced the rumors, saying “all is well”.
In an accompanying caption, Spears wrote: “I wanted to say hi, because things that are being said have just gotten out of control!!! Wow!!! There’s rumors, death threats to my family and my team, and just so many crazy things being said.
“I am trying to take a moment for myself, but everything that’s happening is just making it harder for me. Don’t believe everything you read and hear.”
She specifically took aim at Lufti, reheating old accusations that he impersonated her on email.
She added: “My situation is unique, but I promise I’m doing what’s best at this moment,” Spears wrote.
“You may not know this about me, but I am strong, and stand up for what I want! Your love and dedication is amazing, but what I need right now is a little bit of privacy to deal with all the hard things that life is throwing my way. If you could do that, I would be forever grateful. Love you.”
The following day, breatheheavy (one of the many sites documenting the drama) reports that Britney was photographed getting frozen yogurt. A positive video of her working out and dancing in the rehab's gym appeared on her Instagram shortly afterwards.
When she checked into the facility, she said it was because she had been knocked off balance by a severe illness her father, Jamie, was suffering.
This was the same reason given for the cancellation of her second Las Vegas residency, Domination, earlier in the year.
“A couple of months ago, my father was hospitalized and almost died ... I had to make the difficult decision to put my full focus and energy on my family at this time,” she wrote.
Since the 2007 breakdown, Jamie Spears has been Britney’s conservator, meaning he has the legal responsibility of making decisions for the pop star, which include her career and finances.
Breatheheavy reports that following the #FreeBritney campaign, a May 10 date has been set to schedule “a new status hearing to address the conservatorship” which it describes as “a step towards dissolving the conservatorship which bars the pop star from driving, hiring her own doctors or lawyers, and other basic freedoms.”
As the site says, 'freeing' Britney form the terms of her conservatorship rather than simply getting her out of the rehab is the larger goal of true believers.
TMZ, which some fans have accused of being in league with perceived anti-Britney forces, says her doctors are still trying to fine-tune her medication.
Sources told the site: “Britney’s mental state is much better than it was when she checked in.”
Meanwhile, Britney’s sister Jamie Lynn, 28, posted a protective message on Instagram, saying, “I have been here long before anyone else, and I’ll be here long after. I love my sister with everything I have. So, anyone or anything that speaks to the contrary can GTFOH with all the comments about what you don’t understand.”"
Trump's Dumb Subpoena Talk Won't Doom Him at the Supreme Court - The Daily Beast,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/stupid-trump-subpoena-talk-wont-doom-him-at-the-supreme-court,"opinion Jim Watson/Getty
President Trump’s attempted destruction of America’s legal and constitutional order has now reached an unprecedented level, with a bold claim to “fight all the subpoenas” congressional Democrats issue, regardless of their legal merit.
That fight will likely result in several former Trump officials being found in contempt of Congress, unleashing lawsuits that will likely reach the Supreme Court. Yet it won’t make a difference what Trump says, because, as they did with the Muslim ban and the Census scandal, the court’s conservatives will simply ignore the president’s boasts and take his minions’ pretexts at face value.
It’s hard to keep track of all the alleged instances of lying, obstruction, and fraud that the House is trying to investigate. But there are, at present, four outstanding subpoenas that are being stonewalled.
First, the House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House Counsel Don McGahn to probe possible instances of obstruction of justice described in the Mueller report. (Trump allegedly told McGahn to fire the special counsel, then create a false record denying he ever did such a thing.) The New York Times reported Wednesday that White House lawyers have told McGahn not to comply.
Second, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform has subpoenaed John Gore, a Department of Justice official who supposedly asked Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to add a question about citizenship to the census in order to help DOJ enforce the Voting Rights Act.
According to documents unearthed in litigation, however, that letter was a sham. Ross actually requested that DOJ write the letter and had already decided to add the question—which is projected to cause 6.5 million people not to return their census forms in a boon for Republicans– at the behest of White House advisers Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach.
Gore also received an email advising him not “to say too much” about whether census data might be shared with other government agencies—which is illegal. Obviously, this is exactly the concern of immigrant families: that their answers to the citizenship question could trigger legal enforcement actions.
Both of those matters—the fake letter and the shocking email—are central to the Census scandal, but this week the Justice Department said Gore would not comply with the subpoena. “When the president of the United States says that he’s fighting all the subpoenas because the Democrats are just playing politics, that ought to undermine the subtle legal arguments of his subordinates.”
Third, the House Oversight Committee also subpoenaed former White House personnel security Carl Kline over Jared Kushner’s security clearance. (Trump personally demanded that he receive top secret clearance despite concerns about Kushner’s foreign ties, then lied about having done so ). The White House has ordered Kline not to testify, and the committee chair, Elijah Cummings, has initiated contempt procedures against him.
Fourth, the House Oversight Committee issued a subpoena to one of Trump’s accounting firms, Mazars USA, to testify and turn over documents regarding Trump’s alleged inflation and deflation of his business asset values, which, if true, enabled Trump to cheat on his taxes to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. In response, Trump’s personal lawyers sued Rep. Elijah Cummings, the chair of the committee, to quash the subpoena.
That’s in addition to the House Ways and Means Committee’s request that the IRS turn over Trump’s tax returns themselves—not formally a subpoena, but a request issued pursuant to tax code rules. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said he is reviewing the request, although his April 23 letter on the subject left no doubt that the request will be denied.
In all of these cases, Trump’s underlings have set forth supposed reasons for the refusals.
For McGahn, it’s executive privilege —even though the subpoena is about issues made public in the Mueller report, and thus no longer privileged.
For Gore, it’s because the House committee won’t let him have DOJ lawyers , as well as personal lawyers, in the room with him.
For Kline, it’s because the subpoena “ unconstitutionally encroaches on fundamental executive branch interests ,” according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post.
And for Trump’s tax documents, it’s that there’s no valid reason for the subpoena, and, per Mnuchin , it’s unlawful to disclose tax returns simply to expose the taxpayer.
But Trump, as is his wont, has been blunter. In a statement made outside the White House, Trump described the McGahn subpoena as “ridiculous.” He then continued, “we’re fighting all the subpoenas. These aren’t, like, impartial people. The Democrats are trying to win 2020.”
Now, in an ordinary world, that admission against interest (as it’s legally known) by the central figure in a cluster of controversies would be dispositive. Never mind the legal niceties: Trump has clearly said that his reason for fighting “all the subpoenas” is that he doesn’t believe the Democrats are sincere. He believes the subpoenas are political.
That’s fine, but it’s also not a legal argument. Whatever their motives, if Democrats are legally justified in conducting an investigation—surely true in the cases of McGahn and Kline, maybe so in the tax matters—then complying with congressional subpoenas is a legal obligation.
That justification is not unlimited, of course. It’s settled law that Congress must make a good-faith effort to accommodate the needs of the executive branch. (Among other things, that probably means DOJ gets their lawyer in the room with Gore.) These questions will be litigated in the lawsuits sure to follow declarations of contempt of Congress for failing to testify or turn over documents.
But when the president of the United States says that he’s fighting all the subpoenas because the Democrats are just playing politics, that ought to undermine the subtle legal arguments of his subordinates.
Except for the fact that the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts has shown itself to be inclined to take the Trump administration at its word, whatever Trump himself may say.
The most infamous example of this was Trump v. Hawaii , the case over the “travel ban.” Even though Trump had said numerous times that he wanted to ban Muslims from coming to America, even though he described the final version of the ban as merely “watered down” from the original, Roberts and the court’s conservatives set those statements aside , focusing instead on the security rationales proffered by the administration.
Pay no attention to the orange man behind the curtain, Chief Justice Roberts said, the great and powerful Department of Homeland Security bureaucrats have spoken.
Chief Roberts took the same approach to the census citizenship question this week. Even though there are smoking guns all over the place —emails from Ross and Gore, notes from Bannon and Kobach—Roberts focused in oral arguments on the proffered rationale that citizenship data is relevant to Voting Rights Act enforcement. (In yet another irony, Roberts and the Trump administration have both eviscerated the VRA in the past, yet here regard it as an urgent national priority.)
If this pattern holds, it’s easy to see the Supreme Court—if the subpoena challenges make it all the way there—again disregarding Trump’s blatant statements in favor of the legalistic rationales cooked up by others.
Lawyers used to joke that Trump was the worst client in the world, because he just can’t resist blurting out incriminating statements and making matters worse for himself.
Fortunately for him, however, Chief Justice Roberts just plugs his ears."
Trump Finally Weighs In on the Measles Outbreak; Dems Blame Him for Making It Worse,www.thedailybeast.com,jackie.kucinich@thedailybeast.com (Jackie Kucinich),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-finally-weighs-in-on-the-measles-outbreak-dems-blame-him-for-making-it-worse,"CONTAGION NATION Trump Finally Weighs In on the Measles Outbreak; 2020 Dems Blame Him for Making It Worse Lawmakers have struggled to respond to the spread of the disease, even as it hits a grim milestone. 04.26.19 3:09 PM ET Leah Millis/Reuters
The Centers for Disease Control reported on Wednesday that there were now 695 cases of measles in 22 states, the highest since the disease was virtually eradicated in the United States in 2000. It’s only April.
On Friday, several days after the milestone was hit, President Donald Trump briefly addressed the emerging health crisis when asked by reporters.
""They have to get the shot,” he said. “The vaccinations are so important. This is really going on now, they have to get their shots.”
The president has not always been so definitive about vaccines. In fact, he has repeated and incorrectly linked them with autism . In the early days of the administration, he met with anti-vaxxer Robert Kennedy Jr., who said the president asked him to lead a commission on the safety of immunizations. That commission never formed.
While Trump has only recently addressed the measles outbreak, many of his would-be Democratic challengers haven’t comprehensively tackled it either. Instead, they’ve largely blamed the Trump administration for making a crisis worse by first by giving a platform to misinformation and then by cutting critical programs that educate, fund, and ensure that children are vaccinated.
Those of the 20 contenders contacted by The Daily Beast who responded to questions on the current outbreak were uniformly supportive of vaccinations.
“While there are some who disagree, Sen. Sanders believes opting out creates deadly risks for children suffering from illnesses who may be not be able to be vaccinated and are exposed to children who are not vaccinated,” said Josh Orton, a spokesman for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
Orton said Trump’s policies have worsened the increasingly dire situation.
“Instead of addressing this public health crisis, the Trump administration has made things worse,” he said. “The number of children without health insurance has increased for the first time in a decade. His budgets would cut Medicaid and slash funding for the CDC Immunization Program.”
For example the spending bill the president signed into law in February 2018 included a $1.35 billion cut from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Prevention and Public Health Fund over the next 10 years.
Those cuts, lawmakers warn, have made a direct contribution to worsening general preparedness for diseases like measles. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) made such a charge in a Senate hearing in early March. After an exchange with a doctor on the panel, Warren slammed the administration for attempting to make cuts to critical programs.
“This administration has repeatedly sought to cut the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which supports key immunization programs, and they've continued their efforts to weaken the Medicaid program, which covers all of the recommended vaccines for children and for many adults as well,” she said.
Sabrina Singh, a spokeswoman for Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), said as president, Booker would “do everything possible to educate the public on the spreading of measles and highlight the necessity and availability of vaccines, while also working with his administration and governors in states to contain the spread of the virus.""
One of those governors, presidential contender Jay Inslee (D-WA), said through a spokeswoman that the federal funds can make a huge difference in an outbreak.
“We need federal resources and leadership for a national vaccine initiative spearheaded by Center for Disease Control in partnership with states to counter anti-vaccine messages and halt the number of parents who are not vaccinating their children,” a spokeswoman for the governor told The Daily Beast last month. “The governor strongly urges Congress to provide sustained, predictable and increased funding for a strong public health system and a national vaccine initiative. The initiative should support further research to enhance our understanding of vaccine hesitancy and build an evidence base on how to counter hesitancy and increase vaccination rates.”
In Washington State there have been 72 confirmed cases of measles, according to the Washington State Department of Health.
Sen. Kamala Harris’ (D-CA) campaign said only that she believes people should be vaccinated, pointing to her time as attorney general when her office defended lawsuits filed after the implementation of a California law that eliminated personal belief exemptions from vaccines for school children. The bill was introduced in the wake of a measles outbreak in 2014 that began in Disneyland.
A spokesman for South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg said some exemptions for personal or religious objections would only be permitted “if states can maintain local herd immunity and there is no public health crisis.”
“The law of the land for more than a century has been that states may enforce mandatory vaccination for public safety to prevent the spread of a dangerous disease,” spokesman Chris Meagher said.
The question of whether vaccines should be mandated and the degree to which there can and should be exemptions has proven tricky in states across the country and for federal lawmakers as well. Lawrence O. Gostin, Faculty Director at the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown Law, was part of a group of public health experts to call for federal action in a March op-ed in the Hartford Courant.
Gostin said it’s likely that lawmakers believe this should remain state issue and don’t want to alienate certain religious communities. But, he said, a federal component was needed in a response because diseases don’t respect state lines.
“The problem is that as the most infectious disease, measles can't be isolated to any single state. It is a national (even international) problem requiring a federal solution,” he told The Daily Beast. “The current measles outbreaks originated in Israel, went to NYC, and is now spreading through the country. No single state can do anything about it.”
Lawmakers remain hesitant to adopt this approach though. During a CNN town hall earlier this month, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) was asked whether “as the next president of the United States” she “would you support mandatory vaccination except in the case of medical exception?”
Gillibrand, whose home state in currently in the throes of a measles outbreak, responded that she needed to study whether a federal response was needed.
“I think parents have been afraid,” she said. “I think they've been made afraid by rumors and myths and, you know, fake news. So I think that we need to do a much better job of educating parents about the essential nature of vaccines.”
Ultimately, Gillibrand was not ready to commit to a federal mandate.
“I just want to research it a little more because I haven't thought about if it's a state's rights issue, how many states already mandate it,” she said when pressed by CNN’s Erin Burnett. “ If you made a federal mandate, what the impact would be.”
She added, “I’m not against it. It may be a perfectly good idea, but it's the first time I heard the idea, so I actually want to look into it.”
In fact, only Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) who entered the race this week, contended a federal solution is what is needed to respond to the current measles outbreak.
“We should tie federal education funds to stricter vaccine compliance, and we should provide vaccines at low or no cost to ensure access is never an issue,” he said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “Measles are bad. Vaccines are good. Those truths, for lack of a better term, are self-evident. Not vaccinating kids is dangerous for them and a public health risk for everyone.”

Joe Biden Tops Bernie Sanders’ First-Day Fundraising Tally,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/joe-biden-tops-bernie-sanders-first-day-fundraising-tally,"SERIOUS MONEY Joe Biden Tops Bernie Sanders’ First-Day Fundraising Tally Biden’s $6.3-million tally, however, came from a lot fewer donors than Sanders’ tally—and it included a high-dollar fundraiser held Thursday night. 04.26.19 2:55 PM ET REUTERS
Joe Biden’s presidential campaign announced Friday that it had raised a total of $6.3 million in the first 24 hours of his candidacy—the largest single-day tally for any 2020 candidate thus far.
“That’s more than any other presidential campaign so far,” boasted a note to supporters. The campaign said that 97 percent of online donations were under $200 and that the average online donation was $41. Additionally, they said that a total of 96,926 people contributed and some 61 percent of donations were new and did not come from pre-existing email lists .
A Biden aide told The Daily Beast that the number was measured from 6 a.m. Thursday to 6 a.m. Friday, that the total includes a high-dollar fundraiser Biden attended in Philadelphia on Thursday, and that none of the funds are general-election funds.
The fundraiser was held at the home of David L. Cohen, senior executive vice president at Comcast, where guests were asked to contribute up to the maximum of $2,800 for the primary campaign. Health-insurance executive Daniel J. Hilferty, CEO of Independence Blue Cross, was another host. Organizers told The Wall Street Journal that the fundraiser brought in at least $700,000 but The Daily Beast could not independently confirm that figure. Prior to the event, former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell told The Daily Beast that he was getting calls from people looking for invitations.
Biden’s overall figure is greater than the single-day totals from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX), who previously held the top two highest 24-hour fundraising totals. However, Biden’s tally came from significantly fewer donors than Sanders’ and included the high-dollar event. Sanders raised more than $5.9 million from 223,047 individual contributors and has not held any fundraisers, nor plans to. O’Rourke has not had any fundraisers, but he will hold a high-dollar event in New York City. He raised $6.1 million in his first day from more than 128,000 contributors, which appeared to lead the field, until the campaign's FEC filing revealed that nearly $300,000 of that money was devoted to general election funds.
Biden’s haul helps ease concerns from within the former vice president’s camp and supporters that he would not be able to out-raise several popular 2020 opponents. While he has access to the prior 2012 Obama-Biden email list, it is likely to have diminished in size over the years and, unlike some of his opponents who had transferred funds from Senate runs, Biden began his campaign with $0."
Kansas Supreme Court Rules Abortion Is Protected by State Constitution,www.thedailybeast.com,Emily.Shugerman@thedailybeast.com (Emily Shugerman),04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kansas-supreme-court-rules-abortion-is-protected-by-state-constitution,"Kansas Supreme Court Rules Abortion Is Protected by State Constitution The ruling overturns a state ban on a common second-trimester abortion procedure. 04.26.19 2:19 PM ET Chip Somodevilla/Getty
The Kansas Supreme Court ruled Friday that abortion rights are protected by the state constitution and temporarily blocked a law banning a common form of second-trimester abortion .
Abortion-rights advocates hailed the decision as a victory, noting that it would keep abortion legal in the conservative state even if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade —the 1973 decision legalizing abortion across the country.
“With today’s ruling Kansas’ highest court unequivocally affirmed that the state constitution guarantees women the right to safe and legal abortion,” said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights.“As this decision makes clear, attempts to undermine that fundamental right by banning safe and accepted methods of abortion cannot stand.”
The decision stemmed from a case filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights nearly four years ago, challenging a 2015 ban on dilation and evacuation abortions. The passage of that law lead 11 other states to pass similar bans on the common second-trimester abortion procedure. A number of those have already been blocked by local courts.
After Friday’s decision, the Kansas law will remain blocked while litigation continues.
A growing number of states have moved to change their state constitutions in recent months, after Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination left the Supreme Court with an anti-abortion majority. States like Oregon and New York have passed laws enshrining the protections of Roe v. Wade in law, while others—like Alabama and Arkansas—have passed laws that would outlaw abortion immediately if the landmark decision was reversed .
According to NPR , Kansas legislatures are rallying to add an abortion ban amendment to the state constitution. But for now, the justices wrote, the state constitution protects “the right of personal autonomy, which includes the ability to control one's own body, to assert bodily integrity, and to exercise self-determination.”
“This right allows a woman to make her own decisions regarding her body, health, family formation, and family life—decisions that can include whether to continue a pregnancy,” their decision reads."

NRA Takes a Shot at Its Own President in Court,www.thedailybeast.com,betsy.woodruff@thedailybeast.com (Betsy Woodruff) julia.arciga@thedailybeast.com (Julia Arciga),04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/nra-takes-a-shot-in-court-at-ollie-north-its-own-president-in-court,"04.26.19 6:32 PM ET Scott Olson
Editor’s note: Col. Oliver North announced Saturday morning he will not seek re-election as president of the NRA.
The National Rifle Association took a shot at its own president just days before the kick-off of its huge national meeting.
An updated version of a civil complaint, entered in Virginia state court on April 24, make new claims about Col. Oliver North’s relationship with the company that runs NRATV, the video network linked to the gun rights group. The filings are part of an eye-popping lawsuit the organization filed against its long-time ad agency, which built and runs the network. The suit gives a rare narrative of the tension within the organization. And the updates to the litigation, which have not been previously reported, indicate that friction in the organization is so hot that the NRA is willing to zero in on its own president.
The initial complaint, filed on April 12, discussed North’s contract with Ackerman McQueen, the advertising firm it has worked with for upwards of 30 years. But it didn’t provide much detail on North’s relationship with the ad agency beyond that he would help it produce a documentary series for NRATV.
The updates to the complaint include more detail about North’s work and point to deep irritation between the group and its president. Not only did North fail to deliver on all of the material he promised for NRATV, the suit alleges, but North, in effect, double-dipped by drawing a salary from both the gun rights group and Ackerman McQueen at the same time. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal published a letter Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's powerful executive vice president, sent to the NRA board on Thursday alleging that North tried to blackmail him into quitting the organization.
Representatives of the NRA, North, and Ackerman McQueen did not comment for this story.
According to the suit, the NRA “spent substantial sums on NRATV based on AMC’s [Ackerman McQueen’s] advice” that the programming would result in an influx of cash from fans and sponsors. But that apparently didn’t happen.
The returns on investment, the complaint says, were “less favorable” than the firm predicted—even though North and Ackerman “assured the NRA that Col. North’s profile and ‘brand’ would be actively leveraged to elicit sponsorships for the North documentary series,” the lawsuit reads. North’s brand didn’t make it rain.
Then the NRA’s lawsuit rips into that documentary series. North didn’t deliver as many episodes as the nonprofit expected, according to the suit, and hasn’t demonstrated that he was able to bring in the hoped-for sponsorship cash. “[T]he NRA has no evidence that any substantial sponsorships exist,” the complaint reads. The implications, the suit continues, are “troubling.”
On top of that, the lawsuit claims that North is closer to Ackerman McQueen (sometimes referred to as “Ack Mack”) than the NRA was first led to believe. On Feb. 19, according to the suit, the NRA learned that North wasn’t just a third-party contractor with the firm––rather, he actually received a salary from it, as an employee. If the NRA had known he was on salary, it wouldn’t have signed off on giving him as generous of a contract for the NRATV work as it did.
“The NRA agreed to shoulder a specific financial burden in connection with a specific digital-media project—not to allow its President to be compensated by a for-profit advertising agency for performing generic leadership functions,” the suit says.
The claims about North come as the group is holding its annual gathering in Indianapolis, Indiana. The board will convene, and will likely weigh in on the matters the suit touches on.
Those matters will be particularly front-of-mind because of LaPierre’s letter, which the Journal published . LaPierre said that North told him, through an intermediary, that if he didn’t step down from the NRA, North would share information about him with the board that would be “bad” for him and the NRA. The threatened letter would include allegations of sexual harassment, financial mismanagement, and “wardrobe expenses,” among other charges.
For conservatives, the NRA has a lot in common with the Vatican: powerful, revered, and almost entirely opaque for outsiders. So for the group to publicize in court a messy internecine dispute over money matters indicates the allegations against one of its oldest, closest vendors are just a hint of the group’s internal fights. And the letter the Journal published indicates that fight is really, really messy.
Over the years, the NRA has capitalized on the notion—perceived and real—that it is a top target of the American left. In a recent fundraising letter obtained by The Daily Beast, LaPierre warned the group could close down “very soon.”
“[R]ight now we’re facing an attack that’s unprecedented not just in the history of the NRA, but in the entire history of our country,” LaPierre wrote. “And if this attack succeeds, NRA will be forced to shut down forever.”
The NRA’s stated concerns about outside threats aren’t at all meritless; New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has honed in on the organization, warning financial institutions against working with it. And activists pushing for stricter gun laws—including the group Everytown for Gun Safety and the students from Parkland High School—are organized, strategic, and more visible than ever.
But the new court filings hint that the organization’s internal skirmishes and struggles may be just as big of a threat."

Pete Buttigieg Blasted for Cozying Up to Pseudoscience Goop Queen Gwyneth Paltrow,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/pete-buttigieg-blasted-for-cozying-up-to-pseudoscience-goop-queen-gwyneth-paltrow,"GREAT GOOP Pete Buttigieg Blasted for Cozying Up to Pseudoscience Goop Queen Gwyneth Paltrow ‘The last thing we need is another politician who tolerates this kind of approach,’ a professor at the University of Alberta said. 04.26.19 11:14 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast / Photo Getty
Goop queen Gwyneth Paltrow is throwing a fundraiser for wunderkind presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg—elevating pseudoscience into the political conversation.
Paltrow and her husband Brad Falchuk, along with actor Bradley Whitford and actress Amy Landecker, are set to throw the bash on May 9, with tickets starting at $250 per person, according to Variety .
Scientists and anti-pseudoscience activists ranted about Paltrow’s waltz into the 2020 race.
“Gwyneth Paltrow has built a successful brand by spreading health misinformation and embracing pseudoscience,” Timothy Caulfield, chair of health law and policy at the University of Alberta and author of Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Everything? , told The Daily Beast. “Facts obviously don’t mean much to her. The last thing we need is another politician who tolerates this kind of approach. We need leaders who will champion science, evidence, and critical thinking!”
This isn’t the first time Paltrow has dabbled in politics. In 2014, the Goop founder hosted a fundraiser for Barack Obama, where she fawned , “You’re so handsome that I can’t speak properly,” calling herself one of his “biggest fans, if not the biggest.”
Political pundits don’t see any harm in Paltrow flirting with Buttigieg’s rising star.
“People are shopping for a candidate… Mayor Pete is new, people want to hear from him, he’s a star,” Mathew Littman, a former Obama surrogate and Biden speechwriter, told The Daily Beast.
“I’ve never heard anybody express any interest in Goop,” he said. “I’ve never heard anybody talk about Goop… I don’t know why it would be negative. In this case, she is giving back… If I were a candidate, and Gwyneth Paltrow supported me, I would be thrilled. I’ve never heard anybody mention it.”
Caulfield, however, said that by accepting checks and backing from Paltrow, Buttigieg has propped Goop and its quacky wellness claims on a pedestal, lending them legitimacy.
“Given the amount of harmful nonsense that flows from Goop, I’m always disappointed to see her legitimized like this,” he said.
Massimo Pigliucci , a professor at the City University of New York who studies the philosophy of pseudoscience, said that we’re in for more instances of fake science clashing with politics.
“My best guess is that this has to do with the general degradation of political discourse itself, and particularly with the now mainstream status of concepts like ‘fake news’ and ‘alternative facts,’” he told The Daily Beast via email. “I’m not trying to paint too rosy a picture of politics in the past. It has always been a messy and not exactly rational business, but it does seem like the current crop of politicians—on both the left and the right—is getting more and more accustomed to the dangerous notion that expertise doesn’t matter, or that anyone can be an expert just by declaring it so.”
Pigliucci, who has studied the intersection of pseudoscience and politics for years , said that it’s a bipartisan effort, with both the Republicans’ questioning of climate change and the left’s courting of celebrities like Paltrow.
“It’s bad news, but it’s not really a new trend either,” he said. “It’s part of an increasingly disturbing culture of celebrities, where people who know nothing about science—from Jenny McCarthy to ‘Drs.’ Phil and Oz—regularly appear on television and influence public opinion, thereby causing real harm to people. I mean, measles, of all things, is on the upsurge again, and people like McCarthy and her celebrity sponsor, Oprah Winfrey, can squarely be co-blamed for it.”
Paltrow is more than just a famous influencer. Her company is worth at least $250 million and growing with a Netflix series and a list of exclusive products including facial potions, charcoal toothbrushes, “biofrequency” stickers, and other repeatedly debunked knick knacks. The actress also hosts a series of retreats where tickets start at $1,000.
Paltrow has attempted to address criticism by creating a medical review board for Goop, but a review of the names offered by the company to The Daily Beast shows that most of them specialize in traditional Chinese medicine and other alternative practices that are not recognized by most American medical boards and regulatory agencies.
Which brings us back to Buttigieg. Buttigieg’s campaign platforms have included soundly scientific topics: He’s talked about artificial intelligence in our future job world, and he’s convinced that portable health benefits are a way to counter the tangled mess of the American healthcare system. He’s also an ardent supporter of policies that will address climate change.
All this makes Buttigieg’s acceptance of Paltrow’s Goopy glitz puzzling and dangerous for science, especially since Paltrow admitted earlier this year that, “We didn’t understand that you can’t make certain claims” and that “if we’re going to write about ... a vaginal steam, that it’s funny.”

Trump said that if “there was one gun being carried by one person on the other side” who had “aimed at the opposite direction,” there “very well could’ve been a whole different result.” He then started making shooting gestures with his hands, complete with sound effects, while saying, “Get over here!

An Alabama newspaper has called “for the Ku Klux Klan to night ride again” and hang Democrats with hemp ropes. In a shocking editorial, the Democrat-Reporter in Linden states that the KKK “would be welcome to raid the gated communities” in Washington, D.C., referring to the residences of Democrats and “Democrats in the Republican Party.” The editorial, written by Publisher Goodloe Sutton, expressed anger at both parties for “plotting to raise taxes in Alabama.” When contacted by the Montgomery Advertiser , Goodloe doubled down on his call for action, saying: “If we could get the Klan to go up there and clean out D.C., we’d all been better off... We’ll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them.” He denied calling for the lynching of Americans, saying: “These are socialist-communists we’re talking about.” Lawmakers from the state have urged Sutton to resign.

LONDON—On Aug. 21, 1979, Lord Louis Mountbatten, second cousin of Queen Elizabeth, was assassinated by the Irish Republican Army. Mountbatten was the highest-ranking victim of the IRA during what was known as The Troubles and his death caused widespread outrage: a radio-controlled bomb blew him up as he left on a small boat for a tuna fishing trip from the small Northern Irish harbor of Mullaghmore, also killing two of his grandchildren.
At the time the IRA defended its action by painting Mountbatten as a symbol of a whole generation of British imperialism. They said the assassination was “one of the discriminate ways we can bring to the attention of the English people the continuing occupation of our country.”
Gerry Adams, vice-president of Sinn Féin (maintaining the party’s technical distinction of not being an official part of the IRA), was blunter: “What the IRA did to him is what Mountbatten had been doing all his life to other people.” That was a highly contestable view. For sure, as the last viceroy of British India and first governor-general of an independent India Mountbatten had enjoyed the final vestiges of British imperial power, but he was far from being a despot.
What the IRA probably didn’t realize at the time was that the death of Mountbatten ended a long-running rivalry for influence at the heart of the royal family—a rivalry for control of the way that males in the family were to be raised. This is salient now because of its bearing on the Windsors’ previously poor record of parenting.
Harry and Meghan, along with Will and Kate, are putting as much distance between their parenting and that of the Queen and Prince Philip as can be achieved without actually causing offense by making it explicit.
Of course, parenting in the royal family can never be normal. But Mountbatten always had something more in mind than how royal children should be raised, and specifically the male heirs. In his view to be up to the job they had to be alpha males with Teutonic self-discipline. His influence began with Philip long before Philip and the future Queen Elizabeth ever met (he had a hand in arranging that meeting, too).
Philip was born in Greece but spent his early life in France and Germany, where in the 1930s his father was cozying up to the Nazis. He was sent to England for his education where he was virtually adopted by Mountbatten’s brother, the Marquess of Milford Haven, and his wife. They paid for his schooling and he bonded with their own son, David.
Both were sent to the oldest public (meaning elite private) school in the country, Cheam, where they became known as the Mountbatten boys. They were also left free to roam the large Milford Haven estate without knowing a family secret: in a locked library the Marquess kept one of the largest private collections of Victorian pornography.
This was in keeping with the whole Mountbatten milieu at the time. Louis himself emerged socially in a between-wars world of playboy princes, rakish aristocrats and plutocrats who spent their summers in Mediterranean resorts where men treated women as trophies to be pursued, claimed and discarded. Or, in the most notorious case of them all, the game was reversed and an American married woman named Wallis Simpson landed a catch in England’s Prince Edward, the future Edward VIII who abdicated the throne in order to marry her. Mountbatten was present in 1931 when Wallis met Edward.
The Great War had wiped out one European royal house, the Romanovs, and scattered the remnants of others. Decadence was inevitable, and Mountbatten, acting in deliberate counterpoint to the habits of his own louche crowd, directed his brother that after Cheam Philip should go north to complete his education at a spartan academy in Scotland named Gordonstoun. The routine there gave more stress to physical obduracy than intellectual attainments. Long runs in all weathers combined with cold showers to make a Mountbatten-type man. “Philip complained of being ‘an amoeba attached to the great rock of the monarchy.’”
And it was this path—Cheam followed by Gordonstoun—that Philip, encouraged by the ever-present Mountbatten, inflicted on his own son, Prince Charles, who, in a desperate letter home, wrote: “The people in my dormitory are foul. Goodness they are horrid. I don’t know how anybody could be so foul.” Later Charles summed up the place as “Colditz [the infamous German castle used to incarcerate prisoners of war] in kilts.”
By the time of Charles’s childhood Mountbatten’s influence at the palace had suffered one serious setback. After Elizabeth’s accession he had wanted to reinforce Philip as the Mountbatten surrogate by having the family name changed from Windsor to Mountbatten but this was rebuffed.
Philip complained of being “an amoeba attached to the great rock of the monarchy” and that he was treated as being British “only by adoption.”
Mountbatten’s dynastic ambitions had collided with a quiet but immoveable force, the Queen’s mother. The elder Elizabeth was as deeply grounded in a British bloodline as the Mountbattens were in the German and Greek royal lines.
When she married the Queen’s father, George VI, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was the ninth child and fourth daughter of Lord Glamis, a Scottish laird. Her mother was descended from a British prime minister, a governor-general of British India, and the legendary vanquisher of Napoleon, the Duke of Wellington.
First as George VI’s steadfast wife during the war when she pointedly appeared with the king in blitzed streets to demonstrate a new affinity with the people of London, and then as a mother grooming her daughter to be queen, this Elizabeth was adamant that a German name should not attach to the British monarchy.
However, the Queen Mother may have won the war but she lost a consequential battle. She saw Charles’s distress in his letters from Gordonstoun and suggested to the Queen that perhaps the ordeal should be aborted, but the Queen left that decision to Philip and he was unrelenting.
The result was not only great dramatic fodder for the last series of the Netflix royal saga, The Crown , where Charles’s misery was made manifest, but led to a public perception that has never really abated—that the Queen was a distant mother who believed in a royal tradition that fathers, not mothers, should shape men’s lives. But the irony is that Charles, a prickly and complex figure, never became a Mountbatten while, at the same time, he serves as a warning to the new generation of Windsors that father does not always know best.
Three of the Queen’s four children had marriages that ended in divorce, a failure rate suggesting that Windsor family values were uncommonly flawed. “Other shady figures in the nation’s unofficial political establishment turned up for what had all the makings of an insurrectionist cabal.”
Mountbatten—“Uncle Dickie” to the Windsor children—had a formidable wartime record as a much decorated naval commander, military head of Allied forces in India and Asia, the man the Japanese surrendered to in Singapore and, less gloriously, the Viceroy to India whose frequently absent wife Edwina became the lover of the Indian rebel hero Pandit Nehru.
His wartime achievements enabled him to become an astute political networker and power broker able to go beyond the boundaries of involvement in public life normally observed by the royal family. He was particularly skillful in sustaining the importance —or self-importance—of his role with newspaper editors.
This landed him in a trap that ended in rare public embarrassment and has never really been fully explored or explained.
In 1968 the best-selling British tabloid of the time, the Daily Mirror , usually a rock-solid supporter of the Labour Party, became disenchanted with the performance of Harold Wilson, the Labour prime minister. The paper’s proprietor, a lofty patrician named Cecil Harmsworth King, decided that the Wilson government was leading the nation to bankruptcy and, in a rare abrogation of editorial independence, took over the paper’s front page to write a polemic with the headline “Enough is Enough!” and called for Wilson to be deposed by his own party.
In secret King went a good deal further, planning a coup in which the armed forces would take over the country—with Mountbatten as their commander.
It was an insane idea, but Mountbatten made the mistake of turning up at King’s home—at the instigation of the Mirror ’s editor. Other shady figures in the nation’s unofficial political establishment turned up for what had all the makings of an insurrectionist cabal. Mountbatten sat it out as King explained his plan and emphasized that for it to work Mountbatten’s prestige would be essential.
It was left to another participant to declare that they were discussing treason and at that point Mountbatten withdrew. When details of the plot leaked out King was removed by the newspaper’s shareholders and Mountbatten said he had never seriously entertained the idea of being the man who would lead troops into Downing Street and remove a prime minister.
Mountbatten enjoyed the years left to him as someone who best operated out of the limelight, still playing mentor to Charles even though he had been tormentor, too, by inflicting Gordonstoun on him. Mountbatten advised Charles to enjoy his wild oats while he could while a suitable “innocent” young woman could be found for him as a bride.
The result of that advice came in 1981, two years after Mountbatten was assassinated, when Charles, 33, announced his engagement to Lady Diana Spencer, 20. Asked if he was in love, Charles replied, “Of course… whatever ‘in love’ means.”
They were words that “Uncle Dickie” might well have thought but he was too wise to utter them in public. The outcome of that mindset and marriage was doomed, but at least Diana finally broke the Windsor model of parenting with the results that are now being celebrated. READ THIS LIST"
Trump’s Stonewalling Pushes House Democrats Towards Impeachment,www.thedailybeast.com,Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com (Sam Brodey) betsy.woodruff@thedailybeast.com (Betsy Woodruff),04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-stonewalling-pushes-house-democrats-towards-impeachment,"OH, HELL NO Trump’s Stonewalling Pushes House Democrats Towards Impeachment “Trump’s opacity is moving some members into the impeachment camp,” one Democratic lawmaker tells The Daily Beast. “Translation: it’s always the cover-up that gets ‘em.” 04.27.19 6:37 AM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photos Getty
Donald Trump’s declaration this week that his administration will stonewall “ all the subpoenas ” from Congress has pushed House Democrats to rethink their impeachment calculus.
Top Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi , have said the party will consider impeachment only after doing due diligence—like hearing from key figures like Special Counsel Robert Mueller, obtaining the documents he used in his investigation, and more.
But the White House’s plans to indefinitely stiff-arm their requests for documents and testimony, combined with the instances of alleged obstruction already laid out in Mueller’s report, is complicating that plan— and may drag House Democrats toward impeachment as an appropriately forceful way to respond to the administration’s conduct.
“I think the combination of the chilling depictions in the Mueller Report and Trump’s opacity is moving some members into the impeachment camp,” said one Democratic lawmaker. “Translation: it’s always the cover-up that gets ‘em.”
And a senior Democratic aide told The Daily Beast that the temperature within the conference has gone up since Trump said point-blank that the White House fights all congressional subpoenas.
Contempt of Congress was the third article of impeachment against Nixon — a piece of history that has been front-of-mind for congressional Democrats over the last few days. And Democrats say they are prepared to hold members of the Trump administration in contempt if the stonewalling continues. “If the president is successful in stopping us from collecting evidence... is that in and of itself sufficient obstruction of Congress?” — Rep. David Cicilline
The obstruction outlined in the Mueller Report, said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), a member of the House Judiciary Committee, has “leapt off the page” in the last week with Trump’s refusal of lawmakers’ request.
“I have a hunch,” said Raskin, “that he is moving the whole caucus closer to seeing impeachable offenses.”
On Wednesday, Trump’s attitude about Democrats’ attempts at oversight was crystal clear. “We’re fighting all the subpoenas,” he said outside the White House. “I say it’s enough… These aren’t, like, impartial people. The Democrats are trying to win 2020.”
In the days since Mueller’s report became public, the administration has backed up Trump’s tough talk with rejections of a raft of Democratic requests for documents and testimony on a number of fronts.
On Russia, the Department of Justice has also not responded to requests for Mueller to testify in front of House committees and requests for additional evidence that informed Muller’s conclusions. Trump’s personal lawyers, meanwhile, are fighting the House Oversight Committee’s subpoena of an accounting firm to obtain the president’s financial information.
On other topics of oversight, Democrats are getting the silent treatment. The Justice Department said on Wednesday, for example, that a top lawyer, John Gore, would ignore a subpoena for him to testify about the administration’s addition of a citizenship question to the U.S. Census.
The administration has also stiff-armed the House intelligence committee, where Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) is looking to scrutinize Trump’s finances. The committee has asked for an FBI briefing on security issues at the president’s Mar-a-Lago resort, but has yet to receive one, per a committee aide. The Justice Department also has not responded to the committee’s bipartisan request for documents related to the Mueller Report, the aide said—and a response to a query about communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin did not address their request.
“If the president is successful in stopping us from collecting evidence, then we have a judgment to make: Can we discharge our constitutional responsibility in the face of that, or is that in and of itself sufficient obstruction of Congress?” said Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat and member of House Leadership. “That was the third article of the Nixon impeachment. I don’t know that we’re there yet.”
The Democratic conference isn’t a monolith, and members’ views on impeachment are wide and varied. Pelosi’s ability to keep impeachment talk tamped down has benefited from the near-consensus on that point among the conference’s most powerful committee chairs—namely Nadler, Schiff, Richard Neal of Ways and Means, Elijah Cummings of Oversight, and Eliot Engel of House Foreign Affairs. Maxine Waters, who chairs the Committee on Financial Services, is the exception; she has been pushing for impeachment for most of Trump’s presidency.
But Cummings’ rhetoric sounded markedly impeachment-friendly in an interview with MSNBC’s Joy Reid on Tuesday. When she asked if Trump deserved to be impeached, Cummings responded, “I think he does.”

"A Poignant, Private Look Inside Your ‘Neighbor’s Window’",www.thedailybeast.com,lloyd.grove@thedailybeast.com (Lloyd Grove),04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/a-poignant-private-look-inside-your-neighbors-window,"TRIBECA SPOTLIGHT A Poignant, Private Look Inside Your ‘Neighbor’s Window’ Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker Marshall Curry’s first work of narrative fiction, ‘The Neighbors’ Window,’ inspires equal parts grief, envy, and voyeurism. 04.27.19 2:03 AM ET Coutesy Tribeca Film Festival
It has taken a while—nearly two decades of toiling in the low-budget vineyards of documentary moviemaking—but writer-director Marshall Curry is finally going Hollywood.
The 49-year-old Curry, best known for such documentaries as 2005’s Oscar-nominated Street Fight , a gritty account of current presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker ’s first (albeit unsuccessful) campaign to be mayor of Newark, N.J., and Point and Shoot , Curry’s unsettling profile of American videographer-turned-Libya freedom fighter Matthew van Dyke, recently signed with William Morris Endeavor in hopes of directing a fictional feature.
Judging by Curry’s maiden effort—a 20-minute short subject, The Neighbors’ Window , which is premiering with multiple screenings over the coming week at the Tribeca Film Festival —he won’t have to wait long.
It helps, of course, that Curry’s latest documentary, A Night at the Garden , which chillingly presents seven minutes of archival footage of the notorious February 1939 rally of 20,000 American Nazis at Madison Square Garden, was honored with an Academy Award nomination, Curry’s third, at this year’s Oscars.
Having mastered one craft, Curry was itching to try his hand at another, and to satisfy his itch as quickly as possible. With a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts, and a knack for persuading a cast and crew of more than two dozen to work for four days of shooting more than a year ago at union minimums—while getting the residents of two different apartments to lend them for free—he was able to bring the movie in at under $100,000.
“That was sort of the reason I decided to make a short,” Curry told The Daily Beast about his first experience of directing actors, including young children, and sticking closely to a screenplay he wrote himself. “I know so many friends who spent years and years developing things and trying to raise money and having actors attached and drop out.
“I just thought, I just want to make something and see if I even like it—because maybe I won’t even like it, or maybe I’ll be terrible at it. And I’d rather know that now than know that in five years after I’ve done all these meetings and fundraising and played all this Hollywood nonsense.”
It turns out that Curry liked it and he wasn’t terrible. “I’m not embarrassed,” he said.
His fictional short (which was inspired by a true story told in a 2015 podcast, The Living Room , by San Francisco screenwriter Diane Weipert) packs a powerful emotional punch as it chronicles a married-with-children Brooklyn couple’s reactions—ranging from prurient voyeurism to frustrated envy to vicarious grief—to the young lovers who live in the apartment building across the way and don’t see the need for curtains.
“I cried. I really did,” Weipert told The Daily Beast about her response to Curry’s film—which (spoiler alert!) begins comically, with the older couple unable to resist obsessively watching their young neighbors having rowdy sex through their naked windows, and ultimately veers into the pointless cruelty and casual unfairness of life and fate.
“It was weird, but it stirred up a lot of emotions,” Weipert said about her reaction to the movie. “Believe it or not, it was a really painful experience. Obviously, I was on the outside so I can’t really claim to have any legitimate trauma. But it did make me incredibly sad and reminded me how sad I was.”
Curry’s screenplay closely follows Weipert’s true-to-life experiences until the final scene, which features a surprising dramatic payoff that Curry describes as “an O’Henry twist.” It’s a model of economical storytelling.
Actors Maria Dizzia and Greg Keller are at once convincing and untheatrical as the parents of three young children, burdened by responsibility and approaching middle-age ennui, as they spy on the neighbors with a pair of binoculars and idealize the young couple’s apparently carefree lives. “Believe it or not, it was a really painful experience.”
As a movie director, Curry, who attended public high school in Summit, N.J., drew on his experiences as a teenager acting in productions of Hair and Equus , among others, at the nearby private girls’ school. “In a weird way, my own high school acting enabled me to understand a little bit about what actors go through and are thinking about, and how to talk to them,” he said.
Although initially apprehensive about his foray into fiction, “my doc work let me know how to capture images that are interesting and can be edited. The grammar of editing a film is basically the same whether it’s a doc or fiction. It’s just that with a doc you’re sort of chasing stuff and with fiction you get to pick all those things,” Curry said.
“With a documentary, you’re constantly wrestling with reality that doesn’t want to be controlled,” he added. “You’re constantly working against chaos. Everything just wants to be a mess and you have to push it into a narrative arc, and you have to introduce characters in a way that feels like a movie.
“And with fiction, everything wants to be a cliché. When you’re making a documentary, you do your first pass and then you try to make it feel like a fiction film. With a fiction film, you do your first pass and then you try to make it feel more like a documentary. You want it to be surprising and organic and to feel realistic. Each of them is trying to become the other in some ways.”
The Neighbors’ Window arguably borrows a conceit from the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic Rear Window , “but only peripherally,” Curry said, noting that it isn’t a thriller, and no character is a murder victim.
“It’s amazing to me how many New Yorkers, and frankly people in other cities as well, have told me, ‘Oh my gosh, let me tell you my window story’,” Curry said. “Because everybody has some neighbor or something that happened that they saw. It’s almost part of living in New York City that there’s this shared partial view that we get of our neighbors. We’re intimately connected to these strangers, and we have a view of their lives, but that view is incomplete.”
Marshall Curry will be on hand for the Tribeca Film Festival’s showings of The Neighbors’ Window : April 29 at 9:45 PM at Regal Cinemas Battery Park 11 (Theater 10); May 3 at 3:00 PM at Village East Cinema (Theater 3); and May 4 at 6:30 PM at Village East Cinema (Theater 7)."
How Porn Movies Get Their Wacky Names,www.thedailybeast.com,Aurora Snow,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-porn-movies-get-their-wacky-names,"How Porn Movies Get Their Wacky Names Aurora Snow speaks with adult-industry leaders about how they name their XXX content—and why. 04.27.19 1:16 AM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Photos by Getty
Millions of viewers a month check out the top porn sites , sifting through an equally staggering amount of content and making easily-searchable titles more important than ever. In as few words as possible—the consensus seems to be three to five words per title—producers often aim to summarize the plot and grab your attention. With titles like Bust a Nut in Grandma , The Little Spermaid , OMGape and Make My Ass Pregnant , there’s little doubt about what you’re in for. Who comes up with these cheeky titles day after day, and how?
For many of the smaller independent companies there is no team of creatives brainstorming lists of titles to be approved by the higher-ups. When generating his own titles, Lance Hart, founder of Sweet Femdom Studios and Man Up Films, takes the distribution method into consideration.
“If I’m putting a DVD out to sit on a shelf in hopes of someone randomly picking it up and buying it, the title has to be bold and stick out,” says Hart. “My newest gay DVD is titled Big Dicked Superheroes Taken Down . I need the walker-by to know that there will be men in spandex with big dicks getting roughly boned by villains.” Nailing the right title is a necessity when distributing on DVD, as reprinting the box covers for a better header is rarely worth the cost.
Within the online market, the flexibility to tweak a title can translate to better earning potential —and in some cases make a previously-unnoticed movie skyrocket to No. 1 on the charts. “I made a movie where Batman gets mind-controlled by a sexy superhero girl Riley Reyes and has sex with her. It didn’t do so well with whatever title it had,” says Hart. “In the intro Batman was kind of slut-shaming Super Riley for wearing too slutty of a supersuit, so I changed the title to Slut-Shaming Batman and it was immediately the No. 1-selling VOD on GameLink.”
Though Hart claims he mostly “wings it,” frequently creating content inspired by his set wardrobe, there is also a method to his madness. The first step in creating a successful title is to determine what Hart refers to as the “bullet points” of your porn. “I like to consider what outfits the performers are wearing, since often that’s the only difference in the beginning. Also, there’s what sex acts occur. Then there’s the why. Why are they in this sex situation which would be pretty abnormal in anyone’s natural life?” says Hart. “If I can cover all of this with the title, that’s a win, but it has to be a short title. So Booby Ladies in Pantyhose Pounding Men with Strap-ons is a little long. I start with something like that and try to shave it down. If I can’t get it right, I try a more emotional title, like Give Her Your Ass or something. Sometimes a more emotional title wins in terms of sales.” “If I can’t get it right, I try a more emotional title, like ‘Give Her Your Ass’ or something. Sometimes a more emotional title wins in terms of sales.”
Behind some of porn’s hottest trends, multi-award-winning director Bree Mills believes both visuals and text should hook a viewer, as it’s the title and the visual thumbnail paired with it that will get the clicks. As head of Gamma Films’ Adult Time, Mills has the luxury of working with a pre-production team of writers and content analysts to merge data insights with creative intent when determining potential movie titles. “Within Adult Time, which encompasses the Netflix-type shows that we do, we have different types of projects, like TV shows with recurring series,” explains Mills. “At the end of the day, what gets someone to click in and watch your episode is largely dependent on what they see in the episode cover, and that line you read under the thumbnail should be just as enticing.”
“Last month the most engaging episodes released, the scenes people watched the longest, were scenes that had the word ‘daughter’ in the title,” Mills adds. “The majority of top-watched had that word in the title, though not always falling under traditional family roleplay themes, so it provided insight into the importance of that keyword.”
Despite the analytics, Mills stresses the importance of connecting back to the creative integrity of the project. To get outside of those Porn 101 titles, Mills prefers to think about the project on its own, outside its adult orientation, focusing instead on the visions she’s bringing to life. Mills encourages her colleagues to do the same, while still maintaining an understanding of what’s going to sell it. “I try to make sure the work I’m doing is a mix between the data-driven keyword injections and then focus on what’s going to be a good title for that story you want to tell,” says Mills. “Forget about the fact that it’s an adult film. What’s going to be a good film title?”
Drawing much of her inspiration from mainstream cinema, Mills prides herself on creating titles that draw interest without shortchanging the audience with traditional porn names. “Most of my movies aren’t based on porn tropes; I use points of reference. I’m like a pop-culture vulture, a huge film nerd, and one of the projects I called Half His Age , a film that won movie of the year last year in 2018, is inspired by a Police song ‘Don’t stand so close to me,’” says Mills. “If you listen to that song, you’ll hear the line. I took that nugget of inspiration and paid homage.”
Mills’ company also encourages fans to pay homage by submitting their own scene and title ideas, promoting audience engagement. “Several of our big content lines have been working closely with members for years on submitting story ideas and scenarios,” says Mills. “And oftentimes we’ll take a scenarios from a member that includes a proposed title.”
Thanks to digital content, porn titles are now peppered with data-driven keywords and no longer permanent (unless the movie still makes it to DVD). Despite these modern-day upgrades, and directors who think outside the box, there remains a large percentage of absurd porn titles topping the charts. And it’s easy to see why, if using the old naming formula: sex act + motivation to engage + visual identifier = silly porn title. READ THIS LIST"
"The Private Passions of Rose Cleveland, The Lesbian First Lady of The White House",www.thedailybeast.com,Charles Lachman,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-private-passions-of-rose-cleveland-the-lesbian-first-lady-of-the-white-house,"History Lesson The Private Passions of Rose Cleveland, The Lesbian First Lady of The White House When Grover Cleveland, America’s second bachelor president, was elected he made his sister, Rose, First Lady. She eventually found love with the widow of a millionaire merchant. 04.26.19 11:28 PM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Getty/Library of Congress
If Pete Buttigieg is elected president he would become the first out-gay president, the first not-out gay president being, in all probability, James Buchanan (1857-1861).
Chasten Buttigieg , Mayor Pete’s husband and ace social media practitioner, would become America's first out-gay First Gentleman.
The White House has already housed at least two First Ladies who loved women. Eleanor Roosevelt 's long relationship with journalist Lorena Hickock was the subject of Susan Quinn’s 2016 book, Eleanor and Hick: The Love Affair That Shaped a First Lady .
And then there was Rose Cleveland.
Rose Cleveland was Grover Cleveland’s youngest sister, and when Cleveland was elected president in 1884, he became America’s second bachelor president, after Buchanan.
Cleveland— whose biography I researched and wrote —required a White House hostess, and he named Rose to the position. Rose was thirty-eight and unmarried. Rose moved into a bedroom on the second floor of the White House . Washington got its first real look at her on the night of the inaugural ball.
As First Lady, she should have been the center of social attention, but in reporting on the evening’s activities the Washington Post awarded fashion accolades to the wife of the Vice President, following by the wife of the commanding general of the United States, followed by President Cleveland’s three nieces, his sister, Mary, and finally First Lady Rose, whose white silk gown was depicted without editorial comment.
Four days later, Rose held an official reception. She stood in the East Room greeting a throng of high-society ladies.
The rumor mills started churning. Rose wore her coiled hair short and sensible, although the Washington Post was quick to point out that “there is nothing mannish” about her.
Rose invited a delegation from the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union to tea. This was bold of her: The Prohibition Party had fielded a candidate against her brother in the election of 1884.
Rose drank only water at dinner. She also let it be known to the president that in her opinion he was appointing too many Catholics to high-level positions in the administration—a position Cleveland found “annoying.”
In mid-March, Rose had company at the White House. A woman she knew from Albany, Miss Annie Van Vechten, arrived for an extended stay. Annie was a forty-year-old brunette from a distinguished Dutch-American family.
She assisted Rose in hosting an afternoon tea and attended Sunday services with Rose at the First Presbyterian Church. No one really knew what to make of Annie. Was she Rose’s companion? Or was this a cover and was President Cleveland courting her?
When Annie finally departed the White House in mid-April, Rose apparently sank into a state of melancholia. Some of the formal activities required of her as First Lady were, in her estimation, nonsensical. Conversely, some of the upper-crust ladies she came in contact with found Rose “rather terrifying.”
Like her brother, Rose had an extraordinary capacity for near total recall. It was said that she could conjugate ancient Greek verbs in her head—a skill that was to come in handy in Washington when she found herself passing time on tedious reception lines.
Only two months into her time at the White House, Rose scaled back her First Lady duties and cancelled all White House receptions for the remainder of the social season. She left Washington for New York, for rest and recuperation. In a letter to another sister, Mary, President Cleveland wrote of Rose: “She’d had a pretty hard time here.”
Rose’s days as First Lady came to an end on the evening of June 2, 1886, when President Cleveland married Frances Folsom in the Blue Room of the White House.
Frances was twenty-seven years younger than the bachelor president. Cleveland had known Frances since she was a baby. Her father, Oscar Folsom—Cleveland’s best friend—had lost his life in a buggy accident when Frances was nine, and Cleveland became Frances’ de facto legal guardian who was consulted on all important aspects of her upbringing. Imagine the uproar if such a White House marriage were to take place today.
Rose moved out of the White House. Her time as First Lady had lasted fourteen months. She departed Washington as she had arrived—an enigma.
Rose returned to the humble Cleveland family cottage in Holland Patent, New York, wrote a novel (the rich and “haughty” protagonist was said to be modeled on Frances Folsom), and taught history at an all-girls school in Manhattan. “Oh, Eve, Eve, this is love itself…I love you, love you beyond belief—you are the world to me”
In 1889, Rose met the love of her life. She was vacationing in Naples, Florida, when another guest checked into the hotel. Evangeline Marrs Simpson was the beguiling young widow of a millionaire merchant from Boston. The private correspondence between the women lays bare one of the great forbidden romances of the Victorian Age.
Ah, Eve, Eve, surely you cannot realize what you are to me…
Oh, Eve, Eve, this is love itself…I love you, love you beyond belief—you are the world to me.
You are mine, and I am yours, and we are one.
Gazing at Evangeline’s photograph one day, Rose wrote that she could not take her eyes away—“the look of it making me wild.”
Rose lived to the age of seventy-two. She and Evangeline were living in Tuscany when the great flu epidemic of 1918 swept through the village of Bagni di Lucca on its way to killing 55 million people worldwide. Rose and Evangeline organized the village’s medical response. Rose also cabled her friends in America to send money and medicine.
Rose died six days after she was stricken with fever. By edict of the village mayor, all shops and places of business were closed and flags flown at half-mast in Rose’s honor. When Evangeline died in 1930, she was buried in a grave next to Rose, in a cemetery on the banks of the Lima River.
Rose’s letters to Evangeline remained sealed for fifty years, as stipulated In Evangeline’s will. They can be found today in the archives of the Minnesota Historical Society. READ THIS LIST"
"Lost Souls: The Search for Vietnam’s 300,000 or More MIAs",www.thedailybeast.com,Joseph Babcock,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/lost-souls-the-search-for-vietnams-300000-or-more-mias,"Lost Souls: The Search for Vietnam’s 300,000 or More MIAs Jospeh Babcock As corpses rot and the search for family members’ remains becomes more urgent, there is a special Vietnamese Office for Seeking Missing Persons—but it helps find Americans.
T his story was supported by the Pulitzer Center .
VIETNAM—Mai Huy Du was 17 when he volunteered for the People’s Army of Vietnam in 1970. He came from a small village in Thanh Hoa province, a rural area north of Hanoi, where his parents owned land. To enlist, Du had to travel in secret to a neighboring village where nobody knew his background since landowners were considered untrustworthy by the Communist government and were usually barred from joining the army. But Du had always had a scrappy, independent streak, and with the war against America and its Southern Vietnamese allies at its peak, he was eager to “do something for the country,” as his niece Mai Thanh Ha put it recently. Plus, he felt left out when all his friends had enlisted and he couldn’t.
About a year after he’d left Thanh Hoa for the southern front, Du returned to Hanoi to receive a certificate for distinguished service on the battlefield. There was a brief ceremony and a few days spent catching up with his family before he left again for the south.
“Then he was just gone,” Ha told me.
In 1973, the family received a cryptic official death notice from the military saying that Du had died almost a year earlier, in 1972. “In the death notice we only know that he died in the south,” Ha said, “in the battle in the south.” The name of Du’s unit and the specific location where he was stationed were recorded in esoteric military code, impossible for the family to decipher.
For years Du’s family had no idea what had actually happened to him, or where his body might be. In the early 2000s, Ha and her mother visited a psychic who specialized in what is sometimes referred to in English as “astral projection,” a séance-like ritual where the spirit of the dead inhabits the body of a living person. Ha recalls that while the spirit of her uncle was apparently inside the psychic, his voice sounded very weak, “like he could not talk properly.” The psychic, speaking as Du, told them Du’s body had been destroyed in combat and there was no point in searching for him.
Du is one of hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese soldiers still missing from the war with America. The Vietnamese government puts the number at 300,000, but the actual number of those whose bodies were buried in anonymous graves or never found and buried at all is widely believed to be closer to 500,000. Without a body to pray over and honor on certain days of the year, most Vietnamese believe that the soul of the dead wanders lost in the afterlife, stuck in a kind of purgatory.
“In the east, especially in Vietnam, people believe that the dead who are missing carry a heavy spiritual burden” says Hoang Anh Suong, a Hanoi-based journalist who has written several books on the search for the missing. “It’s only when the family finds the grave that this torment ends, that they finally feel happy because they have fulfilled their responsibility to the dead. Otherwise the family will continue suffering this torment.”
“I have to tell you,” Suong added, “the mothers, the wives, whose child or husband is still missing—when they die they cannot close their eyes.” Consider this clump of dirt as him
Ha, Du’s niece, is 44 years old and works for an international NGO in Hanoi. We met late one weekday morning at The Coffee House, a chain café specializing in latte art.
In many ways, The Coffee House, with its English name and sleek Ikea-esque furniture is reflective of the larger economic transformation Vietnam has experienced since the early 2000s—the transformation from a poor, agricultural nation to one the World Bank now calls “lower middle income” and “one of the most dynamic emerging countries” in Asia. It’s this economic renaissance that has enabled people like Ha to start searching for their missing relatives in earnest.
While we talked, Ha sat perched energetically on the edge of her chair. She has spent years looking for her uncle, devoting hours and hours to chatting on online forums dedicated to finding the remains of missing soldiers where veterans, amateur historians, and relatives of the missing gather to share information and troubleshoot the various logistical hurdles—the serpentine trail of paperwork, the esoteric war-time military code, the details of specific NVA battles and combat strategy—involved in tracking down a body.
Since the doi moi market reforms and lifting of harsh American economic sanctions in the early 1990s, thousands of Vietnamese families have organized private, self-financed search missions, renting cars or buying plane tickets to travel mostly to the middle of the country—provinces like Quang Tri, Quan Nam and Quang Ngai—where fighting during the war was heaviest.
It’s hard to say exactly how many sets of remains have been found and positively identified this way. Reliable records on remains recovery aren’t available, and the DNA testing in Vietnam—facilitated by the government at several state-run labs in Hanoi—has historically been limited and the results unreliable.
“It just seems normal to us,” remarked my translator, a young Vietnamese woman who goes by her English name, Sam. She thought people might think it was strange that I was interested in the topic at all since it was simply such a common part of life here.
If the soldier has been in the ground for 20 years, then he will have aged 20 years with the land. If he’s been in the ground 40 years, then he will have turned into the land himself
But as more time goes by since the fighting ended in 1975, the chances of finding intact remains grows ever more slim.
One North Vietnamese Army veteran I spoke with, Nguyen Suyet Minh, summed up the challenge of searching for remains so many years after the war this way:
“A lot of times when you search for fallen soldiers, you only find a small piece of bone or a tooth. If the soldier has been in the ground for 20 years, then he will have aged 20 years with the land. If he’s been in the ground 40 years, then he will have turned into the land himself—there will be nothing left but black dirt. Then the only thing I can do is collect that black dirt. This is because of his spirit. I put the ball of black dirt in a bag and bring it back to the family. But we don’t let anyone open it, because if they open the bag and see only a clump of dirt, there will be even more pain. So nobody opens the bag, we just bury it in the local military cemetery. This happened in the case of my friend Do Tien Thuy—we couldn’t confirm whether what we found was actually him or not, because to confirm this, to do a DNA test, you need at least a piece of bone. So we have to resolve this case by following a sense of spirituality, and consider this clump of dirt as him.”
Minh paused for a second and looked out the window of the coffee shop where we were sitting. “Even if it’s not him, it’s still a fellow soldier who died in the war,” Minh said, turning back to the table. “Now he can rest in the cemetery, people can come bring offerings and light incense, make sure he doesn’t get cold. That’s how we think about it. This happens a lot in this country.” Women of strength
On a Thursday morning a few days after I met Ha Thanh Mai at The Coffee House, I took a motorbike taxi to the outskirts of Hanoi to visit the office of Marin, a local organization devoted to helping the families of the missing soldiers find any information about what might have happened to their relatives. Marin’s “office” is actually just a two-bedroom apartment in a grey, leaky building in an area often referred to as Hanoi II, a product of the city’s sometimes reckless recent expansion; the streets here are full of new shopping centers and apartment complexes that look as if they were put up overnight and might come crumbling down just as fast.
In the grey apartment building, I rode the elevator to the fourth floor where a small sign on the wall outside of apartment #402 indicated that I was in the right place. Inside the apartment, Ngo Thuy Hang, the 43-year-old who runs Marin, sat at a cluttered desk typing on her laptop. At her back was the apartment’s small kitchen. A color photograph of Ho Chi Minh casually reading a newspaper hung on the wall to her left.
“Come in!” Hang said enthusiastically, waving me over to a sofa across from her desk. She wore a simple black dress and no makeup. Her shoulder length jet-black hair was tucked loosely behind her ears. Hang stepped out from behind the desk and sat on a small stool next to the sofa.
“Okay, listen,” she said, not wasting time on small talk. “If you’re going to work on this topic, the most important thing is to remember the soldiers themselves. Otherwise whatever you write will just be superficial.” She warned that, in general, it might difficult for me to go really “deep”— sau sac —with this subject because I was an outsider.
Then she invited me on a trip the next day. It would be very special, Hang promised. She and two other volunteers from Marin planned to travel to the rural northern province of Yen Bai to visit a 96-year-old woman who had lost two sons in the war with America. Both of her sons had been listed as missing. One of the bodies had eventually been located, but the other never made it back to Yen Bai, which meant that the family couldn’t properly mourn. Hang had some updates she wanted to deliver in person about the status of the missing son’s case. “These are real people, a real family,” Hang said, her tone not melodramatic but very no-nonsense, very practical. “This is who you need to meet.”
A line of people had started to form in the entryway of the apartment while we were talking. The line snaked out into the hallway. These were relatives of the missing who had come to ask Hang for help.
Hang excused herself and went back to her desk. First in line was a middle-aged woman who was looking for her brother. They chatted for a few minutes about all the available information—her brother’s name (Nguyen Van Phuc), where he died (Tay Nguyen), the date of his death (May 6, 1971), and his NVA army unit, (recorded simply with the letters KT).
Then the woman handed Hang some papers. “A family friend brought this back for me,” she said.
“This is just the Enlisted Military Personnel Profile,” Hang said, giving the papers a quick once over. “All soldiers were issued this form. To find the remains now you need either a document called the Record of Military Sacrifice or the Record of Missing in Action.”
I’d arrived at the apartment that morning alone, ahead of Sam, and did my best to follow what Hang was saying. She grew up north of Hanoi, in the port city of Haiphong and speaks in a typical northern accent, with its staccato syllables and sharp, slashing “z” sounds. A southerner might have found her accent harsh or overbearing—or too reflective, as one common southern complaint has it, of communist severity. In the south, the accent is more playful, more sing-songy. But because the overwhelming majority of the missing Vietnamese soldiers are from the north, Hang interacts almost exclusively with families who share her regional accent.
The woman sitting across from Hang seemed a little overwhelmed. But Hang wasn’t slowing down. “Okay,” she said, typing on her laptop as she spoke, “first I will guide your family through the procedure to look for all the documents which will say exactly where your brother died, how he died. Once we have the documents, I can guide you through the process of travelling to the region where he died to see if they ever found his body. If they didn’t, then where have they already looked? That’s how the process will work.”
There’s a specific vocabulary in Vietnamese for talking about soldiers who have died in war. Nobody, for example, uses the general word for soldier— linh —when talking about NVA troops who died in battle. Instead, people use the word liet si , a word that is sometimes translated in English as “martyr” or “revolutionary martyr,” though this translation isn’t exactly accurate since it removes the cultural and political baggage. The term liet si is basically a bureaucratic classification that has migrated into colloquial speech. The word has existed for years in the Vietnamese language—a derivation of an old Chinese term meaning “women of strength” that the communist government repurposed in the 1950s, defining it, according to a 1957 official document, as “a person who died gloriously on the field of honor in the struggle against imperialism and feudalism since 1925.” Only Vietnamese soldiers who have died fighting on behalf of an independent Vietnam would ever be referred to as liet si . South Vietnamese and American dead are simply “soldiers”— linh .
Chet , the verb meaning “to die,” is also never used for NVA soldiers, not on official paperwork or in casual conversation. Instead, liet si are referred to as having hy sinh , or “been sacrificed.” So Hang’s question—one of the most common she asks on a daily basis—of “Where did he die?” would be more literally translated as “Where was he sacrificed?”
Hang is herself the relative of a missing soldier. Her uncle died fighting against the French and his remains were never found. In 2004 she contacted the precursor organization to Marin, which was being run part time back then by a group of university students. When the students started graduating and moving on with their lives, Hang took over, updating the organization’s website and compiling a database of information.
“At the beginning, I just wanted to find information about my uncle,” Hang told me, “but then I realized that these issues impact many families. Back then so much information was secret. And a lot is still secret today!”
Hang quit her 9-to-5 job doing communications and PR for a ceramic tile manufacturer and started working on Marin full time. Her first big project involved travelling by herself to military cemeteries all over the country with her laptop and digital camera in order to build a searchable database of headstones. Over the past decade, Hang has completed several big data projects, including one a few years ago commissioned by the Vietnamese government. In the process, she’s become an expert on the minutiae of government paperwork and esoteric military code. There is, arguably, nobody in Vietnam who is as knowledgeable about the process of searching for the remains of Vietnamese missing soldiers as Ngo Thuy Hang, and no other organization like Marin currently operating in Vietnam.
“Hang and the volunteers at Marin are the only ones doing what they do, at least at such a scale and with such expertise,” says Dr. Paul Sorrentino, a French anthropologist who has done field work with Marin for over a decade and is currently conducting a book-length ethnographic study on Vietnamese remains-gathering.
For thousands of families in Vietnam, Hang is the only hope. Relatives of the missing travel from all over the north of the country seeking her advice; others who can’t make the trip to Hanoi reach out over Facebook or her cell phone. On Youtube, you can find clips of Hang’s appearances over the years on the national broadcasting network, VTV—the Vietnamese equivalent of the BBC—talking about her work with Marin and giving general advice to families of the missing on the process for tracking down a body.
This work has, essentially, become Hang’s life. The Marin office currently doubles as her home. She doesn’t have children and has never married. The stories about Hang in the Vietnamese media tend to emphasize that, as one 2017 profile put it, Hang “really had spent all her youth on Marin, forsaking marriage and wealth.”
Hang declined to discuss her private life with me, though she acknowledges that her situation is unique. “Nobody eats and sleeps with the missing soldiers like I do,” she said at one point. She operates Marin on small, private donations which account for most of the group’s $10,000 annual operating budget. (Hang supplements the budget through the occasional sale of bundles of incense. She also made sure to mention several times during our time together that she only planned on doing this for another two years.
Hang sees so many relatives of the missing that she has to maintain a certain amount of emotional distance. In practice, this means that her attitude can be cold and officious. “Of course I care about this issue,” she told me, referring to the suffering and psychological trauma of the families of the missing—“the pain of the wives, the mothers, and the children,” as she put it—“but I just don’t have time.”
She reiterated that the most important thing, the first step to actually solving this issue, was for the government to release all available information to the families of the missing whose cases were actually tractable.
And for the others, Hang said, “the government needs to tell the people, ‘we’re sorry, but it’s impossible to find anything.’ This searching for remains has to eventually stop.” It takes courage to grab the meat
The most comprehensive official effort to find the Vietnamese missing took place in the period right after the end of the war. In 1976, the Vietnamese government organized groups of veterans into Doi Quy Tap —Gathering Teams—and sent them to places like Kon Tum, Quang Ngai, and Quang Tri, areas in the middle of the country where the fighting had been heaviest. The thinking was that the veterans who had fought in these areas might remember where the bodies of their fellow soldiers had ended up.
As a guide, they relied on maps drawn by the Logistics Teams, the North Vietnamese Army soldiers who had been tasked with cataloguing the dead. During the war, these soldiers had tried to follow a meticulous procedure for keeping track of their side’s heavy losses—nightly meetings to assess who had been killed, which bodies had been identified and the specific location of bodies. They noted all this down in military record books.
But mistakes were inevitable. A lot of times, the Logistics Teams belonged to a rear unit that wasn’t familiar with the battle that had just taken place, or the fighting would still be going on which meant more bodies piling up. Sometimes the bombing and artillery was so incessant, so intense—the total force of the munitions America used in Southeast Asia has been estimated to equal “the equivalent of 640 Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs,” according to historian Nick Turse—that the Logistics Teams would have to wait days before they could begin the work of sorting through the dead.
By the time they arrived at the scene the land would be completely devastated, a barren bomb-cratered moonscape cleared of all vegetation. The bodies of soldiers from different units—even from different sides—would be mixed together, sometimes in a gruesome jumbled mess of limbs and flesh. The soldiers had no choice but to pile anonymous bodies one on top of the other in makeshift graves, recording the locations with whatever nearby landmarks they could identify.
“Today, the cemeteries are very well organized in straight lines,” said Nguyen Trong Luan, an NVA veteran who has searched for the missing. “But back then [during the war] they buried the bodies in a very messy way, using only the trees or a stream or maybe a hillside,” to indicate the location of a grave. When the Gathering Teams showed up after the war, the land had often changed. They would have trouble recognizing the area, Luan said, not to mention the fact that many of the old record books from the Logistics Teams had by that point been lost.
Sam and I met Luan and another NVA veteran, Nguyen Suyet Minh, at a café called Avatar in a neighborhood far south of the Hanoi city center.
“There are several challenges,” Minh had said, recalling his time searching for bodies with a Gathering Team. “The first is the toxic smell from the gas [of a decayed corpse], it starts to rise up. Second is the courage—it takes courage to grab the meat, the tendon still attached to the bone.”
“You see,” Minh said, smiling. “War brings out miserable things like this.” “ If we had the steel ID cards, the search for the missing would be easy. ”
In the period right after the end of the war, the Gathering Teams dug up hundreds of thousands of bodies and reburied them in local military cemeteries, even if the body couldn’t be identified. The Truong Son cemetery, for example, one of the largest in Vietnam, houses over 7,000 anonymous graves.
At the time, this must have seemed like the best solution to the impossible task of identifying the anonymous war dead. Unlike their American and South Vietnamese counterparts, North Vietnamese soldiers weren’t issued dog tags. (“If we had the steel ID cards,” Luan said, “the search for the missing would be easy.”) Instead, NVA soldiers had resorted to etching their names into the leather of their belts or the flimsy metal of their water canteens. Others scribbled personal information on pieces of paper that they then slipped into small glass penicillin vials. “They would tuck the penicillin vial into their pocket,” Luan told us, “and when they died it would still be there, people would find it and get the information.” Other soldiers had relied simply on personal promises, pledges to contact each other’s family if they didn’t survive; though that method didn’t do much good, of course, if most of the unit ended up dead. (“So many died,” Minh said. “So, so many.”) Given all this, plus the fact that the Gathering Teams were encouraged to prioritize finding the bodies of high-ranking military officers, it’s not surprising that the initial post-war push to exhume bodies was full of pitfalls. “It was in ’76,” Ha told me that day at The Coffee House, “when the war was over and people started going back that the chaos and confusion started.”
Then in 1979 the Vietnamese military was occupied with fighting another conflict, a border war with China, a military effort that diverted resources and attention from the post-war efforts of the Remains-Gathering Teams. And after that, the country was staggeringly poor—a result mostly of harsh American economic sanctions that kept Vietnam economically isolated from the most of the world. There was no spare money for searching for remains. The efforts to find the missing basically stalled for the next two decades. Because they don't know how
For Vietnam, the hunt for missing soldiers has become a national obsession. A quick search on Vietnamese Google brings up a dozen news articles in the past few weeks alone— a story about 14 sets of remains recently found in a garden in Quang Tri , for example, or an update on the ongoing search for remains buried near the summit of a mountain in Kon Tum . For the past decade and a half, shows about the search for the missing have been a constant on Vietnamese television, from documentaries detailing specific search missions to specials on the psychics who have become national celebrities for their apparent accuracy in tracking down the bodies of the dead. Vietnamese-language Youtube is full of clips culled from this programming.
“The war ended forty years ago,” begins one 2016 segment about Team K91 , a remains-gathering military unit from Dong Thap province, “but across the country families are still suffering because the bodies of the fallen soldiers are lost somewhere on the battlefield.”
The clips feature a pattern of similar images—search groups trudging through the dense jungles of Quang Tri or the billowy tall grass of Kon Tom, shovels and garden-hoes hacking at fresh mounds of dirt, family members lighting incense and sobbing as they pray over a search site, neglected pots of tea sitting on a living room coffee table while a surviving veteran addresses the camera.
A segment called “ Nhan Tim Dong Doi ,”—“Searching for Fallen Soldiers”— airs after the nightly news on QPVN, one of the national television channels. The segment features an announcer wearing a crisp green military uniform reading off the names of missing soldiers. The name is usually accompanied by a grainy photograph, some basic information, the phone number of a family member, and a plea to call if anyone knows where the soldier is.
Today, much of the searching has moved online, with Facebook groups and online forums devoted to tracking down the remains of missing soldiers. (One of the most popular Facebook groups has around 10,000 members and averages 40 new posts a day).
The Vietnamese government doesn’t publicly release figures on how much it spends each year finding and identifying the remains of the missing war dead. There is, oddly, no centralized office in the sprawling Vietnamese public sector apparatus devoted solely to the mission. Instead, the task falls broadly under the direction of The Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs—usually referred to in English by its acronym, MOLISA—the byzantine government office that oversees everything from employment and work safety to social security. But even this designation of responsibility is complicated by the fact that the military handles the actual searches.
“I don’t understand why there has never been a more centralized and systematic effort,” Sorrentino told me in a Skype interview, speaking from his office at the School for Advanced Studies in Social Sciences in Paris where he’s an associate professor.
For years the Vietnamese government considered detailed information “military secrets.” This policy has loosened somewhat over the past decade; families can now fill out an official request for information about their missing love one that goes beyond that included on the war-time death notice. Still, as Hang emphasized, the government’s handling of this information remains less than totally forthcoming.
“MOLISA keeps a database [on missing soldiers] and the Ministry of Defense keeps another database, but they don’t coordinate with one another,” Hang told me. In general, she seemed extremely frustrated with the government’s inability to execute a more organized, thorough accounting of the missing, but she was also careful not to directly criticize any specific government officials. “Because they don’t know how,” was usually Hang’s answer to questions about why the government wasn’t doing a better job.
“If you ask the government, they will show you lots of efforts that they do,” said Mai Thanh Ha, who searched for uncle Du. Ha believes most of these efforts are ineffective.
The Vietnamese military does sometimes organize official search teams, but these missions focus almost exclusively on mass graves. Though reliable statistics are hard to come by, MOLISA claims to have recovered over 10,000 sets of remains since 2010, mostly from Laos and Cambodia. For individual families organizing their own search, MOLISA offers travel stipends so small that no one I spoke with had ever bothered applying for one.
In 2013, the government announced plans for a DNA identification initiative called De An 150 , or Project 150. The initiative got some attention in the western media, including a short 2016 article in the journal Nature that described how Project 150 promised to be “the world’s largest DNA identification project.” (Nature put the number of Vietnamese missing from the war at 500,000 or more.) The project called for using the most cutting edge forensics technology to extract usable samples from remains that had been buried for decades and cross-checking the DNA with a massive “reference data bank” of saliva donated by relatives of the missing.
But the forensics world was overwhelmingly skeptical of the “unrealistic predictions,” as one American anthropologist who specializes in remains-recovery told me over email. Some forensics experts were concerned that the project “misrepresented forensic genetics’ capacity and might raise unrealistic expectations among surviving relatives.”
In 2015, the Vietnamese government promised to invest $25 million USD in Project 150 and signed a contract with German bio-tech company BioGlobe to provide the training and equipment to update three DNA-testing centers in Hanoi. But so far the progress has been slow. An article late last year in a Vietnamese online newspaper, VOH Online , claimed that the project had positively matched only 24 sets of remains with DNA samples from surviving family members. (There is no mention, strangely, of the $25 million budget figure in the Vietnamese press. In fact, considering the supposed magnitude of the project, there are strangely few mentions of Project 150 at all on Vietnamese Google. Sam, for example, had never heard of it before.)
The more time goes by, of course, the more remains degrade and the harder it becomes to find direct relatives of the missing who are still alive.
“They say they’re building something, but we never know,” Mai Thanh Ha told me. Rain
Early on the morning of July 27th, the official Vietnamese Day of Remembrance for Wounded and Fallen Soldiers, I met Hang outside the Marin office. We gathered on the empty street in front of the grey apartment building—me, Sam, Hang, and another Marin volunteer, Ho Mau Duong. Hang introduced Duong, who is 53 and works as a meditation instructor, as her anh , or “older brother.” Duong was dressed in jeans and a loose t-shirt and drove the 2008 Toyota SUV we’d be traveling in.
Most of the restaurants and stores in the area were still closed, but we found a pho place that was just gearing up for the morning rush—the young wait staff busily setting the tables with canisters of long black chopsticks, metal spoons and the requisite pho condiments: fish sauce, garlic vinegar, chili peppers and lime—and sat down for a quick breakfast.
While we ate, Duong talked about the piece of land he’d recently bought on Cat Ba, a sleepy island in Ha Long Bay covered in jungle and mountains and famous for a rare and endangered species of white-haired monkey, the Cat Ba Langur. The plan, Duong said, running a hand over the back of his shaved head, was to open a meditation center up in the mountains. There would be an area for meditation practice and a small garden for growing vegetables. It would be a simple, quiet life away from the city.
“And eventually I will join him there,” Hang said, finishing her bowl of pho . She was again wearing a simple black dress and no make-up. “Once I stop doing this work.”
The sky had darkened by the time we got back to the car.
“ Mua ,” Duong said, looking up at the clouds through the windshield. Rain.
We made one more stop. Duong pulled up in front of a small café where 67-year-old Nguyen Quoc Hung stood waiting underneath the awning, the cuffs of his pants rolled up at the ankles to avoid the rainwater that had started to run down the sidewalk.
""Mua ,” Mr. Hung said by way of greeting as he stepped into the car and settled into the passenger seat up front.
Technically, Mr. Hung is the director of Marin. He is a veteran himself, a former NVA medic who wears a hearing aid and has a habit in conversation of angling his good ear in the direction of whoever’s speaking. He was originally recruited by Hang in order to fulfil a government requirement that, in order to operate an official office, Marin needed someone with a law degree serving as director.
The rain let up as we drove north out of the city. Construction cranes and the cement carcasses of new high-rise buildings were everywhere. Then we crossed the Red River and the landscape became much more flat, more spare, more industrial, the buildings smaller and more spread out. And then suddenly, after only another ten minutes or so, the buildings disappeared altogether, replaced now with lush green fields of rice paddies and clusters of jungle-covered hills.
At almost the same time we were driving to Yen Bai, 55 boxes containing what was believed to be the remains of American soldiers killed in the Korean War were arriving at an air force base in South Korea. The event had prompted mentions in the Western media about the ongoing search for American MIA remains in Vietnam. Last November, shortly after landing in Vietnam for the APEC summit, President Trump had delivered a statement to a gathering of reporters that included the line, “Our decades-long humanitarian efforts with the Vietnamese people to account for and recover personnel still missing—so important to us—from the war honors the horrors of this horrendous war.” The line, delivered early in the president’s prepared remarks, suggests how the issue of missing American soldiers is still—rhetorically, at least—at the forefront of the American government’s relationship with its former enemy. “ The task of recovering American remains rests, quite literally, in Vietnamese hands. ”
For years, the Vietnamese government has helped the U.S. in the search for missing Americans. There is even a special office in the Vietnamese government devoted solely to the task of finding the remains of missing American personnel; the Vietnamese Office for Seeking Missing Persons (VNOSMP) handles the logistics of the American search missions—they organize the transportation and lodging, track the status of search sites, interview witnesses, and deal with any unexploded ordinance the mission might accidentally unearth. The VNOSMP also manages the teams of local day laborers hired for the manual labor of the actual searching—the clearing of vegetation, the digging and sorting through dirt. The task of recovering American remains rests, quite literally, in Vietnamese hands.
“Cooperating with the U.S. to search for American MIA remains in Vietnam is a way to mobilize U.S. support to find Vietnamese martyrs,” the director of the VNOSMP, Le Thanh Tung, told Agence France-Presse earlier this year.
“We need support from the international community,” Tung added, “including the American side.”
With Vietnamese help, the U.S. has repatriated the remains of about 1,000 Americans since the end of the war. The U.S. continues to spend around $100 million a year searching for their remaining 1,597 missing. The Hanoi detachment of the Defense Department’s POW/MIA Accounting Agency (the DPAA) currently operates out of a large white villa complex on Tran Phu, a leafy boulevard across town from the Marin office, near the city center.
Hang, Duong and Mr. Hung seemed uncomfortable when asked about the obvious inequity in resources devoted to finding the thousands of missing Vietnamese soldiers versus the comparatively small number of missing Americans. “I don’t have much information about that office,” Hang said of the VNOSMP, turning to look out the window of the Toyota at the rolling green of the Yen Bai rice fields outside.
Everyone was silent for a moment.
“We can just smile,” Duong said finally, glancing up at the rearview mirror.
I turned to Sam. “They think it’s ridiculous,” she whispered, “obviously ridiculous.”
The Vietnamese government has explicitly asked several times for DPAA help finding Vietnamese missing, but each time the DPAA has deflected the request, insisting this kind of “government-to-government coordination” needs to go through the State Department. There is no record of the U.S. government offering any financial aid or support for finding missing soldiers from the Vietnamese side.
While working on this story, I emailed the DPAA spokesperson to ask if the detachment had ever helped in any way with the search for the thousands of Vietnamese missing.
The answer was brief: “No.” The pain of a family
96-year-old Nguyen Thi Sinh lives in Hoa Cuong, a small village of dirt roads and rolling green rice paddies tucked into the western corner of the rural northern province of Yen Bai. The path to Ms. Sinh’s house was too narrow for the Toyota to navigate, so Ms. Sinh’s relatives came to pick us up in Hoa Cuong on motorbikes. I rode with one of Ms. Sinh’s children, a middle-aged man dressed in a white tank top, loose work slacks and flip flops. As we weaved down the path, over a homemade dam and a set of overgrown train tracks, he asked me about my flight from America and the salary at my teaching job back home.
In 2014, the Vietnamese government named Ms. Sinh one of 40,000 Heroic Mothers of Vietnam, an official title given to “mothers who have made numerous contributions and sacrifices for the cause of liberation,” the sacrifices being, more specifically, losing more than one son, losing an only son, or losing one son and having another return wounded. (One of the most famous Heroic Mothers of Vietnam is Nguyen Thi Thu, who lost her husband, nine sons, one son in law, and two nephews to war—a litany repeated in all mentions of her story in the Vietnamese media.)
Two of Ms. Sinh’s sons died in the war with America. Binh, the younger of the two, died in 1973, near the city of Hue; his body was eventually recovered and buried in the family cemetery in Hoa Cuong. But Ms. Sinh’s older son, Ky, who reportedly died in 1968 somewhere in the southern-central province of Binh Dinh, is still missing.
Ms. Sinh keeps framed pictures of Binh and Ky on the wall above the large wooden prayer altar that occupies one side of the main room in the cement house where she lives. (The wall also includes a picture of Ms. Sinh’s late husband and a portrait of Ho Chi Minh.) In the pictures, the sons are wearing the dark green uniforms and pith helmets of North Vietnamese Army regulars.
The day we visited Ms. Sinh, the altar was covered in offerings for her sons—a neatly tied bundle of lychee, boxes of cookies, a box of tea, a pack of cigarettes, a can of condensed milk. Along the back of the altar were three decorative vases holding the ashy remnants of old incense sticks.
Ms. Sinh, who wore a simple pair of silk pajamas, seemed a little overwhelmed as we all gathered around the coffee table where someone had prepared a pot of tea and set out half a dozen porcelain cups. Duong took out his phone and started broadcasting this live on Facebook.
Mr. Hung held Ms. Sinh’s hand. “Try not to worry too much, ba,” he said, using the pronoun that means “grandmother.”
Ms. Sinh said she didn’t worry because worrying didn’t help. Her voice was a touch shaky, but still firm, still undoubtedly clear. “We didn’t have any real last words, or any goodbyes,” she said, remembering when Ky had left for the war. “‘Mom, dad, brothers at home, please be strong. I’m leaving but I’ll never do anything to make you disappointed.’ He just said some words like this and then he was gone. We couldn’t go see him. The army called him, and that was all we knew. I just had to let him go.”
Once Ms. Sinh had finished, Hang started to talk. Duong trained his cellphone on Hang as she spoke, broadcasting the scene live on Facebook. Hang addressed both Ms. Sinh and the audience watching online. Ms. Sinh listened patiently, occasionally nodding—“Yes… Yes… Yes…”—as Hang went over the details of Ky’s case. A headstone in a military cemetery in Binh Dinh, where Ky had reportedly died, was engraved with the name Dao Xuan Ke. But paperwork indicated that the body of a soldier named Dao Xuan Ke had already been identified and returned to his hometown. Ms. Sinh’s family believed there had been a mistake on the headstone, and that the grave in Binh Dinh actually held Dao Xuan Ky ’s body.
Hang could now report to Ms. Sinh and her family that Marin had collected enough evidence and official paperwork to convince the government to allow the body to be transferred to the family cemetery in Hoa Cuong. It was just a matter of time now before the government gave the final approval for the exhumation. This particular case was shaping up to be a success.
“What do families of the fallen soldiers need?” Hang asked rhetorically, now addressing the audience watching on Facebook as Ms. Sinh sat quietly in the background. “They need information about their fallen heroes. They need The Party and the government to take responsibility in sharing this information with them.” For the next 15 minutes Hang outlined the Ministry of Defense and MOLISA’s mishandling of information. “The Ministry of Defense must immediately release the information about where each missing soldier died, the exact location,” Hang concluded in her usual clipped, no-nonsense tone. “That is the first thing they must do, and the most important.”
The Facebook live video from Ms. Sinh’s home racked up a total of 1,100 views, 11 shares, and 36 comments. “Nothing compares to the gratification of easing the pain of a family who can’t find the remains of their loved one,” wrote one viewer. Not all about the bones
In December, Paul Sorrentino, the French anthropologist, returned to Vietnam to continue the research for his book. Early in the trip, he sent me a message: “It seems like the Project 150 is not really happening,” he wrote. The massive DNA identification initiative had apparently stalled completely. For one, according to Sorrentino, the bone samples collected so far were too old and degraded for DNA analysis. The other reason was “an organizational mess” among the three government labs charged with doing the testing. “Instead of collaborating, it seems like they’ve been competing with each other,” Sorrentino said. An engineer at the Institute of Biotechnology in Hanoi—one of the three labs—had told Sorrentino that he’d recently quit Project 150 and was now working at a private hospital. The engineer had complained about “the usual narrative: there was a lot of money but it just went into some big guys’ pockets.”
“Might be true,” Sorrentino added. “And would be sadly banal.”
Instead of doing field work related to Project 150, Sorrentino had been spending most of his time with Hang. He had tagged along with Hang and Duong on a trip to Quang Tri to visit the local offices of the Department of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs where the government employees showed him a new software they were using to centralize information from the military cemeteries. It was basically the work that Hang had been doing for years on her laptop. But these local civil servants seemed like good people, Sorrentino said, and genuinely cared about the work.
And Hang seemed happy. “She sees the end of this thing,” Sorrentino told me in a phone conversation. “Soon it will be done. All the bodies that can be found will be found.”
Hang’s job now wasn’t just about finding remains, it was “to also help the families understand that it’s not all about the bones. They can find a way to do something right, even without finding the bones.”
“The book I write on all this,” Sorrentino added, suggesting this new angle had come to him only recently, “it’s going to be about renouncement —letting go. How for many families it’s about finding a way to do without the bones, because many of them are never going to find them.”
Hang too, of course, would also have to let go, to move on with her life while thousands and thousands of soldiers were still missing. But it seemed as if she had come to terms with that, Sorrentino said, and was excited for her future life with Duong at the meditation retreat on Cat Ba island.
After dinner on my last night in Vietnam, I asked Hang a question about the parents she and Duong shared back in Haiphong. Hang smiled. “You still think he’s my real brother,” she’d said. Anh , the pronoun Hang used with Duong—the pronoun which means literally “older brother,”—is also the pronoun a woman uses to address her lover. What happened to their son?
Mai Thanh Ha is still looking for her uncle Du. Earlier this year, she travelled to Kon Tum, where the government was building a memorial on the hill where Du had apparently died. In the government paperwork, Du died on March 3rd and the veterans Ha talked to at the memorial in Kon Tum told her that this had been a day of particularly heavy fighting, that the Americans had bombed and then stormed the hill that day and “everyone had died.” The chances that she might find a surviving veteran who had seen what happened to Du were slim.
Ha also visited the local military cemetery in Kon Tum. She chatted with the security guard and spent hours walking up and down the seemingly endless rows of simple cement headstones. Thousands of graves were marked with the words “ Chua biet ten ,”—name unknown. The cemetery was quiet, peaceful. The sun was bright. In the clear sky above, birds glided on the fresh Central Highland’s breeze.
“It’s a beautiful place, a nice place,” Ha remembered thinking, as she recounted the trip to me. She assumed this was where her uncle must have been buried.
Then she drove in her rental car to the nearby city of Gia Lai, where Du’s unit had been stationed and where the military had erected a memorial wall etched with the names of every missing soldier who had fought in Kon Tum—over 13,000 North Vietnamese Army soldiers whose bodies had never been found. But her uncle’s name wasn’t there, which didn’t make any sense.
Her flight back to Hanoi was in a few hours, so she started driving to the airport when a call came through on her cell phone from a local official in charge of handling old military records for the area. When Ha had met with this official earlier, he’d checked his files and said that he couldn’t find Du’s name anywhere. Now he told Ha over the phone that he’d just found the name Mai Huy Du on an old list of missing soldiers.
Ha turned around and drove to the man’s office. She noticed right away that these were the original records—the book containing the soft, faded pages was old and worn around the edges. Du was listed along with 82 other soldiers as missing. But this didn’t exactly resolve anything. “’Missing’ during the war time,” Ha explained, “means they don’t find the body, they can’t confirm that you are dead.”
The trip to Kon Tum seemed to only confuse things further. The death certificate the family received in 1973 said that Du died on March 3rd, the day of heavy casualties on the hill. But in the old military records book Du was listed as missing on February 29th.
When she got back to Hanoi, Ha sent the official from Kon Tum all the information she’d collected over the years about her uncle, but she never heard back from him.
“I think I’ll call him someday, but I don’t think he can really do anything.”
Her eyes started to fill with tears as she talked about all this.
“I just want to see his name written somewhere, you know? When I do this, searching for my uncle, I think about his parents, my grandparents. How could they die and never know what happened to their son?”

"Helen Gurley Brown’s ‘Daughter’ on the Cosmo Editor’s Legacy, #MeToo, and Anita Hill",www.thedailybeast.com,olivia.messer@thedailybeast.com (Olivia Messer),04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/anita-hill-metoo-and-cosmo-editor-helen-gurley-browns-legacy,"IT'S COMPLICATED Helen Gurley Brown’s ‘Daughter’ on the Cosmo Editor’s Legacy, #MeToo, and Anita Hill A new book on the legendary Cosmo editor nails her wits and charm—but some of Helen Gurley Brown's office-sex tips, and her legacy on Anita Hill, don't stand up to modern scrutiny. 04.26.19 11:20 PM ET Santi Visalli/Getty
Just two years before she died at the age of 90, Helen Gurley Brown was tap-dancing in her New York penthouse, waiting for the elevator.
Brown’s husband, Jaws producer and former Cosmopolitan managing editor David Brown, had just died. And she didn’t want to be alone.
“As we’re waiting for the elevator, she starts singing and tap-dancing to ‘I love you, a bushel and a peck,’” her longtime friend, writer Lois Cahall, told The Daily Beast. “She doesn’t want me to go, so she’s trying to stay humorous and adorable. We stepped in, and this very handsome guy in workout clothes comes onto the elevator.”
“She scanned him up and down and said: ‘We have delicious men living in this building, don’t we?’”
Even in her late eighties, Cahall said, “Everything was sexual.”
The famous Brown, who died in 2012 , was best known for writing the 1962 bestselling guide to single womanhood Sex and the Single Girl before she took the helm of Cosmopolitan as the magazine’s first female editor.
Brown—who called herself a “mouseburger” and everyone else “pussycat”—served as editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan from from 1965 until 1997, from her boudoir-like corner office outfitted with leopard print rugs, floral couches, frilly curtains, and a tiny chair from which she would hold court.
She also accumulated 178 lovers before she was married .
Cahall, who met Brown in the 1980s, eventually came to see her as a second mother.
“After interviewing for a job in New York one day, I ended up that night celebrating on the balcony at Studio 54, and later dancing with Chevy Chase,” Cahall said. “Helen sat nearby in her leopard pumps and micro-mini skirt. She was like my corny pioneer, cheering me on with a shared sense of enthusiasm.”
The two struck up a friendship that lasted decades.
“I began to channel her as my mentor, my friend, and eventually my new mother. And she let me,” Cahall said. “What started out as ‘Dear Mrs. Brown…’ turned to ‘Dear Helen’ and finally ‘Mommy Helen.’” “Even in her late 80s, 'everything was sexual.'” HELEN BECOMES FICTION
Cahall and Brown’s relationship helped inform the forthcoming novel Park Avenue Summer by Renée Rosen, which will publish next week on April 30. The book is a charming dive into 1965 Manhattan, when Brown took over Cosmo and changed it forever.
The book’s fictional heroine, Alice Weiss, lands a job as Brown’s secretary and helps the idiosyncratic character dodge several schemes to sabotage the magazine—all while dating men, attending glamorous dinners, and pursuing her dream to become a professional photographer.
Rosen said Cahall’s influence on the book changed it for the better, and kept Brown’s character from becoming a caricature.
At first, Cahall said, Rosen had written Brown as an Anna Wintour-esque editor.
But Brown wasn’t like that at all. “Helen was always two steps ahead of everyone else in the room.”
“She really, she wanted to put people at ease,” Rosen told The Daily Beast. “Within five minutes of meeting her, she’d tell you she was wearing a padded bra, fake eyelashes, and a wig. She didn’t want anyone to be intimidated. She had that doll’s chair, a little tiny chair smaller than everything else in her office. She would hold court there.”
In Brooke Hauser’s biography of Brown called Enter Helen , she wrote that the editor-in-chief’s “insecurity was cellular” and a guidepost for how she treated other people.
“She wanted everyone to feel like they were on a level playing field,” Rosen said.
Cahall described her as an affectionate woman covered in red lipstick (“on her lips, on her teeth, on her cheeks”).
“We always kissed full-front on the lips,” said Cahall, and Brown often made sexual comments to her college-aged daughter: “Do you know you have a beautiful bosom, pussycat?”
“She was persuading me all the time: Worship the penis. Worship the penis,” Cahall added.
Brown has been endlessly described as “whispery” and intentional in her flirtations.
“Everything had a reason,” said Cahall.
“Helen was always two steps ahead of everyone else in the room,” said Rosen. “She would just sort-of steer the conversation that way, without anybody else realizing it. She always made sure she got what she wanted.”
“Lois kept me more honest and more faithful to Helen’s true character,” Rosen said, noting that she felt like she was getting to know both women—whom she called “girls’ girls”—at the same time. “There is a catch to achieving single bliss ... You have to work like a son of a bitch.” — Helen Gurley Brown, in 'Sex and the Single Girl' HAVING IT ALL
“There is a catch to achieving single bliss,” Brown wrote in Sex and the Single Girl . “You have to work like a son of a bitch.”
And so she did.
In addition to her reign over Cosmo , she published at least nine other books, including Sex and the Office (1964), Outrageous Opinions of Helen Gurley Brown (1967), Helen Gurley Brown’s Single Girl’s Cookbook (1969), Sex and the New Single Girl (1970), Having It All (1982), The Late Show (1993), The Writer’s Rules: The Power of Positive Prose (1998), I’m Wild Again (2000), and Dear Pussycat (2004).
Despite the books, the statement jewelry, and the iconic red lips, Brown was a gentle and demure figure when she was at home, Cahall said.
Brown was born Helen Marie Gurley on Feb. 18, 1922 in Green Forest, Arkansas, and her father was a school teacher. Brown’s father died when she was only 10 years old, and shortly afterward her sister was diagnosed with polio. She lived in a trailer park.
“I never liked the looks of the life that was programmed for me—ordinary, hillbilly and poor—and I repudiated it from the time I was 7 years old,” Brown wrote in Having It All .
“We both came from the trenches, the lower classes. Her from her trailer park, me from my Armenian immigrant family,” Cahall said. “We never lost sight of where we came from.” “Brown penned a Wall Street Journal column in which she criticized Anita Hill's charges against then-U.S. Judge Clarence Thomas.”
Brown wrote hundreds of letters to Cahall over the years, including one dated September 12, 2003, a few days after a dinner at Cahall’s home: “You are an exceedingly good cook and thoughtful child though I would rather be your girlfriend... I never wanted a child—no time or inclination to raise one though you seem to have taken care of that detail! You are wonderful to have supplied such joy (as in being a good cook and a good child.) All my love and thanks, Helen.”
“Helen was brave by nature, and taught the women who worked for her by example,” Jill Herzig, formerly editor in chief of Redbook (and now director of content innovation at Weight Watchers), told The New York Times in 2012. “When example wasn’t enough, she had no problem telling you, Oh come on—be gutsy. I did as I was told.”
But as much as Brown cheered on other women, she doled out advice that even Rosen admits appears “atrocious” in retrospect.
“Whether her work helped or hindered the cause of women’s liberation has been publicly debated for decades,” The New York Times wrote in Brown’s obituary . “It will doubtless be debated long after her death.”
Several passages of Sex and the Single Girl wouldn’t hold up to the scrutiny of the #MeToo movement. But even decades later, in 1991, Brown penned a Wall Street Journal column in which she criticized Anita Hill's charges against then-U.S. Judge Clarence Thomas. Brown wrote that “a little sexual tension in the office never hurt anyone.”
“Some girls ‘hate’ men because they secretly envy their superior advantages, their jobs, their ability to exploit,” Brown claimed in Sex and the Single Girl . “Get it straight in your head that anyone who wants to kiss you or sleep with you isn’t handing you a mortal insult but paying you a compliment. Oh, I know some men proffer their kisses and propositions with all the finesse of an invading army.”
In another chapter, she counsels that young women find men in their offices, even if “your company frowns on intramural dating.”
“Date anyway,” she wrote. “You will undoubtedly be fired, but imagine leaving under such a romantic cloud... a woman so attractive to and attracted by the opposite sex, she was willing to collect her unemployment insurance for them!” “think she would have been surprised by today’s #Metoo movement, and proud of them, but I don’t think she would have been a fan of how the #MeToo is diluting their cause over every single issue.”
Some of her other advice is bizarre—but impossible to ignore: In her 1982 book Having It All , Brown suggests that a woman may connect with a man by taking a strand of pubic hair, having it encased in plastic, and making it into a paperweight for his desk.
Had she lived to see 2017, Cahall said that Brown’s feelings about the #MeToo movement likely would have been complicated.
She was “a creature of sex and pleasing men,” Cahall said. “It was the way her mind was wired—and really, would we have wanted her to be any other way?”
“She created her own movement in the 60s,” Cahall continued. “I think she would have been surprised by today’s #Metoo movement, and proud of them, but I don’t think she would have been a fan of how the #MeToo is diluting their cause over every single issue. Can men no longer flirt with women? That’s probably how Helen would have seen it.”
Ultimately, Rosen believes Brown’s most important message is: “Make your life full. Make your life interesting. The men will come.”
“She had an instinct for what women needed in that time in history, and she gave it to them,” Rosen said. “There’s a generation of readers that may have heard the name but have no idea who she really was. I’m really excited about the opportunity to introduce this feminist icon, who had more impact on our lives than many people realize.”
“I’m really excited for new readers to discover Helen Gurley Brown.”"

STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR—The Rock disappears in the mist as Africa slowly emerges before us. To our right, Jebel Musa looms, one of two contenders for the southern Pillar of Hercules. Jebel Musa is in Morocco, though it is not to Morocco that we’re heading. It is rather to the Spanish enclave of Ceuta, above which, faintly discernible now, the Spanish and European flags wave listlessly.
Along with Melilla, another enclave several hundred kilometers to the east, this autonomous city, Spanish since 1668, remains the only patch of European soil on the African continent. As such, it has become a magnet for migrants, mostly from West Africa, who arrive at its fortified border with Morocco with visions of Europe dancing in their heads.
As is the case elsewhere in Europe, such immigration has become increasingly contentious. After running on an anti-immigration platform recalling those of Donald Trump and Europe’s various nativist groups, Spain’s newest far-right party, Vox, is expected to win a sizeable share of the vote in this weekend’s general election. Ceuta and Melilla have loomed large in the party’s campaign. The trials and tribulations of the migrants themselves have unsurprisingly gone overlooked.
Though doubtless less perilous than the maritime route—a deadly trek through the Sahara and war-torn Libya onto boats destined for Italy and Malta and the bottom of the Mediterranean—Spain’s land borders with Africa are not without their risks. The Ceuta-Melilla route runs through Algeria and Morocco, where sub-Saharan Africans are loathed and police brutality against them is rampant, and attempts to storm the razor-wire fences are put down ferociously, with long odds of success. CEUTA
Oumar Sibide is, he tells me, one of the lucky ones. The 18-year-old has been in Ceuta for five months, but on the road for the past two years. He left his family in Côte d’Ivoire when he was 16 and walked the nearly 5,000 kilometers north.
“Hundreds of us tried to get across,” he tells me when I ask about the border crossing. “Only some of us made it.”
We are sitting outside the Centro de Estancia Temporal de Inmigrantes (CETI), a refugee reception center in the forested hills to the west of the city. Sibide shows me the cross-hatched scars that adorn his hands, a grisly reminder of his run-in with the razor wire.
“It was a very frightening experience,” he says. “They didn’t want to let us across. The Moroccans tried to stop us and the Spanish tried to stop us. But the Spanish police are not as bad as the police in Morocco. If we had been caught there, we would have been beaten and sent to the desert. I have seen many people beaten.” (Both the Moroccan and Algerian governments have been accused of abandoning migrants in the Sahara.)
Dressed in a camouflage-print T-shirt and cargo pants, Sibide looks every bit his young age, his thousand-yard stare the only thing to suggest what he has been through since he left home. “I have talked to a counselor at the center,” he says, “but sometimes I still have nightmares.”
While he admits that he is an economic migrant—he left home to make money for his mother and siblings—it is difficult not to feel that, by this point in his travels, he has become a de facto asylum-seeker, too.
An estimated 57,250 irregular migrants arrived in Spain from North Africa in 2018, more than managed to do so over the previous several years combined. This represented nearly half of all Mediterranean arrivals to Europe last year. Indeed, while overall numbers of arrivals are down from their 2015-16 peak, the Moroccan-Spanish route experienced a surge in 2018, eclipsing the deadlier Libyan-Italian route, which continues to account for the vast majority of migrant deaths at sea.
I am reminded of Trump's ""caravans,"" wending their way through Mexico. I am reminded of Australia's immigration ""crisis,"" which has led to an irrational fear of ""boat people"" and one of the most draconian asylum seeker policies in the world. In terms of sheer numbers, neither crisis compares.
Europe’s changing political dynamics largely help to explain the boom in Spanish arrivals. When Italy’s right-wing government shut its ports to charity-run rescue boats last year, Spain’s center-left one, headed by Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, proved willing to pick up the slack. In June, Spain agreed to accept migrants aboard the rescue ship Aquarius after it was turned away by Italy and Malta, while Spain's interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, has openly expressed a desire to remove the razor wire from Ceuta and Melilla’s fences. “Vox leader Santiago Abascal has channeled Trump by calling for an 'insurmountable wall' along Ceuta and Melilla’s borders and arguing that Morocco should be made to pay for it.”
In an interview with El País in August, the E.U. Commissioner for Migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, praised the government’s “European spirit” while also issuing a warning against unfettered immigration. By accepting the Aquarius , he said, “I think Spain reacted in a very positive way. But it cannot go on this way.”
Ceuta’s majority-conservative leadership agrees, not entirely without good reason. Attempts on the fence are occurring with ever greater regularity— and, according to Guardia Civil officials, they are also occurring with ever greater violence. In late August, more than 100 migrants forced their way into Ceuta by throwing battery acid and quicklime at police.
For his part, Vox leader Santiago Abascal has explicitly channeled Trump by calling for an “insurmountable wall” along Ceuta and Melilla’s borders and arguing that Morocco should be made to pay for it. He has also said that the Spanish military should be given “the necessary orders” to defend the frontiers.
On the Spanish side of the border, the migrants who manage to make it across are met with a system buckling under the pressure. Originally designed to accommodate 500 people, the Ceuta’s CETI is currently believed to be home to nearly twice that number.
Even the migrants themselves can sense that the Spanish government is being stretched thin. Fahad Abdallah, 30, is listening keenly to my conversation with Sibide, providing a kind of running commentary on the younger man’s answers. When Sibide says the situation at CETI is better than nothing—better, in any case, than the situation in Morocco—Abdallah, originally from the Comoros, laughs, and dismisses him out of hand.
“He’s only being polite,” he says. “The food is terrible. There are not enough beds. We are 10 people to a room. It is a living hell.”
Of course, Abdallah doesn’t have to stay here. The migrants are not required to do so. But the center provides its residents with jobs, however menial and poorly paid, and those who have recently arrived in the enclave want nothing more than to work.
Neither Sibide or Abdallah have any idea when, or even if, they will make it across the Strait of Gibraltar, but doing so remains the goal. Ceuta may technically be European, but it’s not the Europe they had in mind. They are only paid a few euros a day, but both are saving up for the crossing.
The question of money is one that preoccupies Omar Bah, 25, as well. Originally from Sierra Leone, Bah has been in Ceuta for a little under four months—“three months and twenty-two days,” he tells me—and works outside a supermarket in town, helping people with their groceries even when they don't need it.
“I make enough money to buy food and cigarettes,” he says. “I will never be able to afford the ferry. It took me nearly a month to save enough for a phone card. I had to call my mother.”
Wearing a yellow high-vis vest and a rapper cap that reads “DOPE,” Bah, too, walked from West Africa to Spain, traversing Mali and Algeria—assisted in the desert by smugglers, he says—before arriving in Morocco, where he lived in the forests around Jebel Musa for a little over a year. “We were alone out there but for God,” he says. He considers himself a political refugee, his father having been killed during Sierra Leone's civil war, which ended in 2002.
A group of Guardia Civil walk past and Bah shakes his head in wonder. “The police are so much better here,” he says. “We had to hide all the time in Morocco. We hid in the forest like animals. Because we have the registration card here, we can work. The police leave us alone.”
He hopes to eventually make it to the continent, where he says he’d like to find work as a mechanic—or, ideally, as a musician. “Music is my passion,” he says.
Our conversation is cut short when a woman emerges from the supermarket.
Apologizing to me as he does so, Bah goes into work mode. As he leaves, I ask how he hopes to get “over there.” “It isn’t easy, man,” he says. ""It isn't easy.""
A week later, 385 kilometers away, I find myself perched atop the ancient fort of Melilla, gazing down upon the city’s port with a group of young Algerians. It is midnight, and we are here to witness the nightly spectacle of young men taking the crossing into their own hands. MELILLA
I am here for journalistic reasons and they are here for practical ones.
Kemel Moussati, 19, is all but taking notes. “It is important to see how it works,” he tells me. “You can get arrested if you’re not prepared.” Before attempting to stow away on the ferry to Almeria, it behooves one to get a sense of how it is done.
The demographics are slightly different in this smaller of the enclaves, with Algerians and other Arabs comprising a sizable portion of the migrant population. Many claim to be political refugees from Algeria’s long-entrenched ruling party, the National Liberation Front, across the border. Refugees from Syria, Palestine, Yemen and Lebanon are also represented, many of them applying for refugee status legally at the Office of Asylum and Refuge at the border. (Ceuta’s OAR, by contrast, isn’t operational.)
The border is an easy walk from the center of town, Melilla butting up close against its Moroccan neighbour, Beni Anar, on it southern side. “The fence has proved as ineffectual at it is ugly: my companions this evening, all here illegally, easily found their way across.”
I walked out there this morning out of morbid curiosity. Unsurprisingly, the fence was a blight on the landscape, a scar through torn terrain ripping away to the west. A wasteland strewn with broken bottles rolled out on either side in its wake.
Predictably, the fence has proved as ineffectual at it has ugly: my companions this evening, all here illegally, easily found their way across. I can’t imagine Trump’s wall—or indeed the one Abascal imagines for this part of the world—stemming the flow in any meaningful way. There’s too much determination going around.
The show begins around one in the morning. A few young men, apparently on a late-night stroll, approach the fence surrounding the port and, individually and in pairs, deftly navigate the rolls of razor wire atop it, dropping nimbly to the other side. They continue their stroll as though nothing has happened, decidedly unhurried in their movements, and disappear from view.
For a long time, nothing much seems to happen. The only movement below is of passengers alighting from the late-night ferry along the enclosed walkway above the port. Then there is a flash of something from the direction of some shipping containers. Djamal Hosni, 20, raises a pointed finger in silence.
Bodies have begun darting between pillars and containers, timing their furtive appearances and disappearances with those of the ever-prowling police vehicles. Their target: the Baleària ferry, a high-speed, 82-meter-long passenger ship, and, more specifically, the ropes tethering it to land.
None of us speak, as though to do so might somehow jinx the operation, alerting the police to the migrants’ presence.
It is a cruel irony—a bad joke played by history and geography—that the countries hardest hit by the migration crisis should also be those hardest hit by the financial one, countries where unemployment remains in double digits on a good day.
The Europe of the migrants’ fantasies is, for the most part, precisely that: an illusion. One thinks of the continent’s ascendant far right, of parties like Italy’s The League and the Alternative for Germany, which are lying in wait to demonize and scapegoat them; of the knock-off handbags they’ll wind up slinging on Plaza Mayor and by the Trevi Fountain; of the accommodation, 12 or more to a room, they can expect to be granted upon making landfall; of the migrant ghettos to which they will likely be relegated on the outskirts of cities like Paris and Birmingham.
One knows—because one is not an idiot, however liberal one’s politics—that Europe cannot take on such numbers indefinitely. Not for cultural or demographic reasons, as cited by neo-Nazis and nativists, but because these countries’ systems cannot handle the load. An estimated 1.8 million irregular migrants have arrived in Europe since 2014. The continent's historical and moral responsibility as the beneficiary of colonialism is ultimately beside the point.
One doesn’t mention any of this to Moussati and Hosni, who are nervously smoking Moroccan kif as the drama below us continues to unfold, and not merely because to do so would be to break the spell of our silence.
For one thing, they already know, and want to try their luck in Europe anyway. “Anything,” Moussati will tell me later, “would be better than going home.” For another, it’s hard not to be on their side. Tonight, at least, the complexity of the situation, the sheer logistical magnitude of it, can be momentarily brushed to the side in the interest of the men on the ground. We all of us want those men to succeed, to appear all of a sudden in silhouette, shimmying up the rope.
None do. There are too many police cars, their timing too perfect. The Algerians are less disappointed than determined: Moussati insists they will do better tomorrow, when they attempt to board the boat themselves. All that remains is to see how the men escape the port, which, it occurs to me now, will be rather more difficult than getting into it was. But it is late, and we are tired, and we don’t stick around to see. READ THIS LIST"
Bill Maher Accuses Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of ‘Stalking’ Trump,www.thedailybeast.com,marlow.stern@thedailybeast.com (Marlow Stern),04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bill-maher-accuses-democratic-rep-adam-schiff-of-stalking-trump-on-hbos-real-time,"Bill Maher Accuses Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of ‘Stalking’ Trump The HBO host grilled the Democratic congressman about the Mueller Report on Friday night. 04.26.19 11:07 PM ET HBO
On Friday night, Bill Maher opened the latest edition of his HBO program Real Time with some groan-worthy dad jokes about the controversy surrounding Joe Biden, who announced his presidential candidacy this week.
“It’s obvious: the ‘woke left’ is not excited about this,” cracked Maher. “They’re like, ‘Oh great, another white guy in the race.’ So today, Joe announced that he is transitioning and the woke people loved that, but then he fucked up his own gender pronoun and now they hate him again.”
Yeesh . There was more, about how Biden was “brave” to go on The View where he’d be surrounded by “all those huggable ladies,” which the comic said was “like sending a drug addict to Burning Man.” But enough of that.
The more interesting talk involved Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who sat down with Maher prior to the panel portion of the show to discuss the Mueller Report.
Calling Robert Mueller “a conservative” who was “going to follow established policy,” Rep. Schiff said he didn’t think it was “realistic” that the special counsel would indict the president and those that did were being “unrealistic in their expectations.”
The congressman did, however, conclude from the report that “Russians were engaged in a systemic effort to interfere in our election; that the Trump campaign welcomed it, embraced it, built it into their plan, made full use of it, lied about it, covered it up, and then obstructed the investigation into it; and, if we had any doubt before about this president’s fitness for office, there is no doubt remaining: he is unfit for the presidency.”
Maher then pushed back. “But this was our big gun. Now it just looks like you’re stalking him,” he said. “I think in the eyes of the people who don’t follow it that closely, which is most of the country, here’s the thing about Bob Mueller: he’s the last thing in America that left and right agreed on. Left and right basically agreed, this is a guy of honor, this is an honest guy, an honest broker, whatever he says goes…The fact that he was like umm…If you couldn’t impeach before, how are you going to impeach after? Or should you?”
Rep. Schiff, who seemed taken aback by the “stalking” comment, responded, “I’m not there yet on impeachment. I may get there—he may get me there—but here’s the awful dilemma that we face: if we don’t impeach him, that sends a message that this kind of conduct—this obstruction of justice, this kind of willing use of the help of a foreign adversary, all the lies and cover-up—that this is non-impeachable. At the same time, if we do impeach him, and he is acquitted, as he would likely be acquitted, then the message is: those are non-impeachable offenses.”
He concluded: “At the end of the day, Bill, there is only one way to deal with the problem whether we impeach him or not, and that is to vote his ass out of office.”
But Maher wasn’t done. He proceeded to press Rep. Schiff on the two strategies of Democratic candidates that have emerged in 2020: Biden’s, which is to run against Trump, and the rest, which is to not focus on Trump and stick to policy.
“I’ve seen you on TV a lot over the last couple of years. I know everything you know, or that you tell us, about the Russian situation,” Maher told Rep. Schiff. “I don’t have a clue what you think about health care—I’ve never heard it. I don’t know whether you’re for Medicare for all or improved Obamacare or get a chicken. I don’t know what.”
“Here’s what I was telling my colleagues, and particularly these wonderful candidates we had running in the midterms: don’t talk about Russia,” Rep. Schiff offered. “What I urge the candidates and I urge our nominees to talk about it is, how are you going to help American people put bread on the table? How are you going to help them provide for a secure retirement in an environment when people don’t stay in the same job their whole life?”
“I’ll tell you who I’m behind in 2020, and I’m behind them heart and soul: any living adult 2020,” Schiff added. “Anyone who gets the nomination, we all need to get behind.”"
Visit These Paris Churches While Notre Dame Is Being Restored,www.thedailybeast.com,Liza Foreman,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/visit-these-paris-churches-while-notre-dame-is-being-restored,"Visit These Paris Churches While Notre Dame Is Being Restored Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Photos from Getty Notre Dame's blaze awakened my curiosity and set me off on a journey of discovery that opened my eyes to dozens of forgotten churches that I had spotted around Paris but overlooked Liza Foreman 04.26.19 11:07 PM ET
P ARIS—As the flames roared from the roof of the Notre Dame on April 15, I stood among the thousands of Parisians who swarmed like bees to the Île de la Cité, the medieval heart of Paris.
For much of that Monday night, I then stood with a group of cops who said the Paris landmark could be gone in two hours. We held our breath silently.
Notre Dame survived by a cat’s whisker. (City officials put the window between life and death for the cathedral at 15-30 minutes of intense work by firefighters that stopped the flames reaching the bell towers that would have seen this Gothic masterpiece crumble.)
As the fire subsided, I wandered through the emptying streets, in what was now the early hours of Tuesday, passing the red fire engines that stood like discarded toys on cobbled streets that were built at a time when motor vehicles were like spaceships of the future. The next night, she stood alone in darkness. Charred but not forgotten.
Then the real journey began. Five long days had passed, going from press conferences at fire stations to the adjacent Hôtel-Dieu, the oldest hospital in Paris, where the firefighters working on site rested.
It was shocking. But the Notre Dame blaze awakened my curiosity and set me off on a journey of discovery that opened my eyes to dozens of forgotten churches that I had spotted around Paris but overlooked, until now.
There are 197 churches in Paris (according to Wikipedia), and 37 Notre Dames, many remarkable, and many of them forgotten. I had noticed quite a few of these churches before, but they remained backdrops to my destination.
The weekend after Notre Dame was ablaze, I found myself, unexpectedly, on both a spiritual and visual odyssey, stepping inside rarefied spaces with an atmosphere quite different to the Paris I had experienced until now.
I discovered great beauty. I found sub-cultures and communities, art, song and life. Young boys placing candles under sky-high domes. Easter rituals carried out in grand costumes. Gospel choirs. Historic interiors in a city so rich in architectural jewels, that when one church steals all the limelight so many others are ignored.
I have never gone to church, even though my grandparents are buried in the most famous of them all—the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, which only added to the sense of discovery.
But as the city healed, so did I as a byproduct of my adventure. (I had lost four homes at the end of 2018—a beach cottage in a seaside town where I grew up, a studio where I lived for a year, a dance community which I shared with an invisible family for 10 hours a week, and a friend with whom I shared an emotional space and journey.)
I found inside these houses of God a safe retreat from from the world that I had forgotten existed. The spirit of Christianity opened its doors to me, and this non-believer’s eyes were opened to dozens of stunning spaces and hidden histories all over Paris.
Here’s what I found.
L'Église de la Madeleine
My adventure began with an immersion into the sounds echoing through the vast interiors of La Madeleine, one of four major churches that has been undergoing renovation here, on Saturday night. A young boy stood beneath the altar repeating, “I believe,” in French, his tiny voice carrying through this imposing neoclassical building which was modeled upon the Pantheon. It was constructed, in its current incarnation, as a temple to the glory of Napoleon’s army, and was the site of Chopin’s funeral. The body of Louis XVI was brought here, to an older church, after his execution. A fresco in the dome above the altar, by Jules-Claude Ziegler, shows Napoleon standing center stage between key religious figures.
Église Saint-Augustin
The journey continued a 10-minute walk north to the highly visible Église Saint-Augustin, which was built during Haussmann’s renovation of Paris, and occupies its own island between a number of grand boulevards. It was built to be visible from both the Madeleine and Arc de Triomphe.
Inside, a guardian was busy ushering people out 30 minutes before closing so this visit was rushed. Still, it was just enough time to see some of the stunning decoration, including cast iron shafts that cross the ceiling. Built between 1860 and 1868, it was intended as the resting place of Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie, who were instead buried whilst in exile in England. This one has also been under renovation, and looks clean and beautiful as a result.
Chapelle Expiatoire
A cross on the map lead me to the discovery down the road of a blackened church, surrounded by a small garden, dedicated to Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette, who were first buried here after they were guillotined. The couple were later moved to the landmark Basilica of St. Denis, just outside of Paris, which is a must-see for church enthusiasts. The Chapelle was designed by two of Napoleon’s favourite architects, Charles Percier and Pierre Francois Leonard Fontaine, and completed in 1826. It was designed in a late neoclassical style. Today it looks eerie and abandoned, although it’s open to visitors and tourists. Locals on Saturday night sat on park benches inside this curious looking compound, away from the bustle on the busy streets nearby.
Catholic Church of Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption
The journey continued along Paris’s poshest shopping street, Rue Saint-Honoré, with the discovery that a church, opposite a Chanel boutique, that I have never seen open, is a Polish institution. I wandered inside this beautiful, light space to hear an Easter ceremony in Polish. I quizzed the young Polish men wandering about in white frocks, and was reminded of the community purpose of a church, and the cosmopolitan esprit of Paris. This compact church, filled with beautiful frescoes that sit within the 24-meter-wide rotunda, was also modeled upon the Pantheon. The design was then altered, as it was considered too radical for Paris in the 1670s. It was built on land bequeathed by the Jesuits to the Sisters of the Assumption. French painter Charles de La Fosse painted the 65 meter square fresco of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, up above.
Église Saint-Roch
The journey continued with a stroll further down the Rue Saint-Honoré to the Église Saint Roch. I stood outside this one in 2008, among the crowds that gathered for designer Yves Saint Laurent’s funeral, and have visited Verbreuil Saint Roch, an artisan bag store next door which shares walls with the church. But now I walked past the homeless people who sit on the steps 24/7, and walked inside this late Baroque church. Louis XIV laid the first stone for the church, which is dedicated to Saint Susanna, in 1653. There were many events and even shootings here during the French Revolution when it was ransacked. One of the highlights of the church today is a giant blue and gold design on the back wall that looks like an expensive high-jewellery broach. On Saturday night, there were a half-dozen people inside but the promise of good music with upcoming gospel choir concerts were advertised in the lobby.
Saint Thomas d’Aquin
I found Saint Thomas d’Aquin by following a cross visible from nearby Rue de Bac. Constructed in 1682, and designed by architect Pierre Bullet, this neat church on a stylish square took a break from religious service after monks were expelled in 1793, during the French Revolution. Today it stands in a peaceful spot in the lovely 7th arrondissement, next to a future campus for one of Paris’s top schools, Sciences Po. It’s another great spot to get away from the hustle and find peace and quiet.
Sainte-Clotilde
As darkness fell, I ventured along Rue de Grenelle, one of the most exclusive streets in Paris, getting deeper into the highbrow 7th arrondissement. I ventured inside a stunning church that I walked by most days and often marveled at but have never been inside. Indoors Sainte-Clotilde whose striking towers rise from beyond an immaculate square, choir boys placed candles around the stone columns that run through these cool interiors. Priests came and went from a dressing room, and a smattering of locals gathered for service. It was beautiful.
The Dome
I walked home to the 7th, passing though possibly the most imposing square in Paris, Place des Invalides where Napoleon’s tomb stands inside a royal chapel, known as the Dome. Built from 1677 onwards, the Dome also served as an army barracks during WWII. Vauban’s mausoleum is inside, and Napoleon was laid to rest there in 1861 after his body was returned from
St. Helena
Easter Sunday at the Holy Trinity Cathedral and Russian Orthodox Spiritual and Cultural Center
The journey continued the next morning with the Russians. It was Palm Sunday—the Orthodox Easter falls a week after the Catholic Easter this year. Completed in 2016 by architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte, this new Russian cathedral with its combination of clean minimalist exteriors and gold, Russian-style bauble domes on the roof, is Paris’s funkiest church. Russian families gathered inside to watch a colorful ritual, with priests dressed in shimmering robes. It was another community expat moment inside these beautiful interiors with their modern-day frescoes.
American Cathedral and American Church in Paris
In March, one of the most stunning shows at Paris Fashion Week took place inside the American Cathedral. Indian designer Manish Arora’s colorful Indian designs were paraded through the aisles, before a grand finale was shown by the altar. This Gothic-style cathedral was completed in 1886. The striking American Church complex nearby sits on the other side of the Seine. The first American church outside of the U.S. dates back to 1814.
L’Oratoire du Louvre
Another favorite with the fashion community is the Oratoire du Louvre on Rue Saint-Honoré. Witness recent fashion shows from designer Iris van Herpen to French couture designer Julien Fournie. The American community worshipped here before they had their own church. This Protestant church sits opposite the Louvre and was founded in 1611. It became the royal chapel for the Louvre Palace in 1623.
For those looking for the less obscure, my favorites among Paris’s most famous churches include:
Saint-Sulpice
Made famous by the Da Vinci code, this church in Saint Germain was deserted on Easter Sunday afternoon. Its iconic west facade was added in the late 18th century and inspired by Christopher Wren’s St. Paul’s Cathedral in London.
Saint-Eustache
It gets overshadowed by the eyesore Les Halles shopping complex at the center of Paris but has some beautiful frescoes and domes inside. Renovations are ongoing.
Sainte-Chapelle
The only church in Paris that I found to have long lines around the block, this one is famous for its stained glass windows and beautiful hand-painted interiors that are similar to the beautiful church on Boulevard Saint-Germain. It was the chapel of the kings of France until the 14th century, and was built in Gothic style. It was consecrated in 1248.
Saint-Gervais-et-Saint-Protais
Built between 1494 and 1657, the current church of Saint-Gervais-et-Saint-Protais is situated in the trendy Marais district. It was the first example of French Baroque style in Paris. It has a higher bell tower than Notre Dame and was a target for the Germans during World War I.
Sacr é -Coeur Basilica
I spent one fashion week staying inside a convent that is part of the Sacré-Coeur, which is one way to get even deeper inside Paris’s church culture that I would recommend. I had a bird’s eye view of the church from my convent room and took lunch with the nuns. The second most visited site in Paris, it sits on the highest point in the city on the Butte Montmartre. Designed by Paul Abadie, it was constructed between 1875 and 1914 and consecrated in 1919, after WWI."

Mom and Dad Run a Gay Porn Shop! In ‘Circus of Books,’ filmmaker Rachel Mason chronicles life as the daughter of gay bookstore owners, telling a heartwarming story about family, acceptance, and LGBT survival. 04.26.19 11:06 PM ET Courtesy Tribeca Film Festival
The unspoken rule in the Mason household was that you never talked about the family business.
It would all seem very mafia-like, at least until you meet the Masons, Karen and Bill. She’s wearing a dressy red shirt, with her graying hair cut into a practical bob, all framing a sweet smile and sensible outlook on life. His bright blue Hawaiian shirt befits the zanier personality of the couple, who have spent the lion’s share of their marriage operating this business-that-would-not-be-named together.
Everything seems on the up-and-up. Their daughter, Rachel, is a documentary filmmaker. Her brother, Josh, says, “We’re a normal, tight-knit family” that was “striving for the perfect family look.” The third Mason child, Micah, marvels about his father: “Dad is one of the few people whose default state is happiness.”
That they spent most of their childhood in the dark about what their parents did for a living was purposeful. “We didn’t want them to know what we did at all,” Karen says. “We thought maybe people wouldn’t want to play with them.” On the rare occasions they’d have to go to work with their parents, the kids were under strict instructions to stare at the floor and not look up.

For more than 30 years, Karen and Barry Mason owned and operated Circus of Books , a bookstore and Los Angeles LGBT landmark that happened to also be a hardcore gay porn shop and adult film business.
Their story is now being told in Circus of Books , a riotous and surprisingly emotional documentary that premiered Friday at the Tribeca Film Festival .
Rachel Mason directs the film, using her parents’ unexpected careers to explore myriad topics, weaving them all together with cheeky, though heartfelt aplomb: the struggles of operating a small business; the history of the LGBT community in West Hollywood, where Circus of Books was located and became a sanctuary for decades; the curios of an unusual career; and the evolving relationship between parents and their children.
On the latter note specifically, the film explores how something we blush and giggle about—gay porn—became the barrier to and eventually the catalyst for the deepest connections the Mason family would eventually forge.
Circus of Books starts as a gonzo movie about a wacky way of living, but follows that thread as it reveals how that lark of a profession became a life’s work, and then a spiritual and human calling. It’s quite beautiful, catching the eye of Ryan Murphy , who executive produces, and Netflix, which scooped up the film earlier this week ahead of its premiere for streaming on its service.
Karen and Barry Mason, as we see them chronicled in Circus of Books , are the kind of hardworking, doddering older couple that millennials would pretentiously call “adorable.” They’re just like your grandma and grandpa—that is until they start talking about which cockrings will sell better at the register and remarking about the publishing of Handjobs magazine with the rote boredom of an office worker discussing spreadsheets and memos.
“You would never expect these people…” famous ’80s porn star Jeff Stryker, who would spark a friendship with the Masons, laughs.
Karen began her career as a journalist at the Cincinnati Enquirer , where she specialized in criminal justice and over the course of her time there covered plane crashes, murders, smut raids, and, perhaps in a bit of foreshadowing, interviewed Larry Flynt. “The film explores how something we blush and giggle about—gay porn—became the barrier to and eventually the catalyst for the deepest connections the Mason family would eventually forge.”
During a trip to Los Angeles to visit her parents, she met Barry at a Jewish singles party. “He had a motorcycle,” she said. They got married seven months later. She wore a blue dress. He wore a striped jacket that cost $7.
Barry at the time was at the UCLA Motion Pictures Department, getting a job working on the special effects for 2001: A Space Odyssey and Star Trek. He was also an inventor, applying his special effects skills to medical devices. He made a modest living as an inventor of new dialysis equipment, until malpractice insurance skyrocketed and made the career untenable.
Starting a family and strapped for cash, they responded to a full-page ad Larry Flynt had taken out looking for independent distributors for his racy magazines that mainstream clients wouldn’t touch. The Masons would become one of the first distributors of Hustler , eventually broadening their inventory as Flynt’s output diversified, also peddling gay magazines Blueboy , Honcho , Mandate , Woodworking , and more.
“ New York Review of Books never sold very well,” Karen laments. “What sold was Hustler. ”
One of their biggest buyers of the gay titles was the West Hollywood shop Book Circus . When Barry noticed that they stopped paying their bills, he saw an opportunity and called the landlord to take over the space. They had to rename the store, so they just decided to cut the sign in half, flip the words around, and just pay for the word “of.”
“That’s like our whole philosophy of retail,” Karen laughs. “How could we do this cheap, because it may not work?”
Rachel follows her parents with an endearing curiosity. She had been denied a window into this part of their lives as a child, and wanted to learn more about it—and more, why the secrecy?
She looks through an inventory spreadsheet with names of videos like Damn Your Hairy #2 , Got It Bad for Step-Dad , and Gangland Super Gangbang #5 . Karen tells her, “These are the videos that sent you to college.”
She follows Karen to a sextoy expo, filming as her mother shops for anal lube and dildos and discerns which will sell well at her shop. Karen walks to a wall of dildos and talks through the different models, shapes, and sizes, exhibiting her extremely specific business acumen. “But I don’t like looking at it,” she says. She’s pragmatic about it all, but doesn’t feel comfortable in the world.
We learn how Circus of Books ’ three-decade existence backdropped the most tragic, triumphant, and crucial moments and movements in the fight for gay rights and survival. “She looks through an inventory spreadsheet with names of videos like ‘Got It Bad for Step-Dad’ and ‘Gangland Super Gangbang #5.’ Karen tells her, ‘These are the videos that sent you to college.’”
Alexei Romanoff, a LGBT activist and one of the last people still alive from the crucial demonstrations at the Black Cat bar in 1966, recounts how, on New Year’s Eve of that year, literally as people sang “Auld Lang Syne,” police raided two Los Angeles gay bars and started to arrest people who were kissing. Demonstrators took a stand against police brutality, two-and-a-half years before Stonewall . New Faces, one of the bars where the demonstration took place, became Circus of Books.
Former customers and employees, including RuPaul’s Drag Race superstar Alaska Thunderfuck, recount the liberation gay men in the community felt at the store, especially back in its heyday. They fondly remember “Vaseline Alley” behind the store, where cruising and sex happened.
For some employees who were battling AIDS, Karen and Barry would become the only visitors at the hospital to say goodbye. As conservative politicians waged a war against obscenity, the FBI would even make examples of them and the book store.
In stark contrast to this progressiveness was a traditional upbringing for the Mason children, underlining how, even for peddlers of a gay porn shop, the shame that underscores the matter was inescapable.
Karen was never comfortable telling people about the business. When people found out, they would often say, “I don’t have any problem with that,” but that felt like judgment to her. No one says that to a person who says they’re a teacher or a lawyer. “They probably did have a problem with that. I had a problem with that.”
That shame made a lasting impact, especially as Josh Mason struggled with coming out to his parents as gay himself. What surfaces from the film is a tender spotlight on the complexities of sexuality and understanding. Karen and Barry Mason made gay porn, yet they had to work to accept the fact that their own son was gay.
It becomes clear especially then that this is more than just a documentary about a funny job. It’s a case study exposing our ever-conflicted feelings about gay sex as a society. It’s a story about the survival of the gay community. With technology, online stores, and apps negating the need for gay bookstores, gay bars, and other watering holes, what will happen to the culture? At its heart, too, it’s about love and family, two ever-timely issues for the community.
To paraphrase a favorite mantra about porn magazines: come for the pictures, stay for the story. READ THIS LIST"
White House Counsel: Official Who Cleared Jared Kushner Agrees to Hill Interview,www.thedailybeast.com,betsy.woodruff@thedailybeast.com (Betsy Woodruff),04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/white-house-counsel-official-who-cleared-jared-kushner-agrees-to-hill-interview,"‘INTERBRANCH CONFRONTATION’ White House Counsel: Official Who Cleared Jared Kushner Agrees to Hill Interview After Trump ally Jim Jordan stepped in and said he could be interviewed with White House lawyers present. 04.26.19 10:32 PM ET Jonathan Ernst/Reuters
Carl Kline, the official who green-lit Jared Kushner’s security clearance, has agreed to attend a voluntary interview next week with staff for the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, according to a letter from White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.
The letter, which The Daily Beast obtained, comes at the end of a week of fervid clashes between Chairman Elijah Cummings; Carl Kline, the career official who approved Kushner’s security clearance over the objections of other career officials; and the White House Counsel’s office.
Cummings subpoenaed Kline on April 2 for an interview with his committee staff. Kline and the White House agreed that he would not attend if he couldn’t bring lawyers from the White House Counsel’s office, arguing that the interview could involve material potentially covered by executive privilege. Cummings’ team told Kline he could not bring lawyers from that office, so Kline and the White House decided he would not go to the interview.
Cummings subsequently moved to hold Kline in contempt, paving the way to make him the first official held in contempt under the newly Democratic-controlled Congress.
That’s when Jordan, the top Republican on the committee and a White House ally, stepped in. Earlier on Friday, he wrote a letter to Kline inviting him to come in for a voluntary interview, with White House lawyers on hand. Jordan said the invitation was meant to “avoid unnecessary conflict” and “de-escalate Chairman Cummings' orchestrated interbranch confrontation.”
Cipollone quickly took Jordan up on his offer—though he said there will be some restrictions. The interview will be “limited to White House personnel security policy and practices,” Cipollone said in the letter. The interview is scheduled for May 1, according to Cipollone’s letter.
A spokesperson for Cummings did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesperson for Jordan said he was happy to receive the letter.
The question of how Kushner got a security clearance has become a flashpoint for Democrats, and has drawn significant public attention. Tricia Newbold, a career official who initially blocked Kushner from getting a clearance, has shared detailed information with the committee about the process, along with the issuance of numerous other clearances which she said should not have been granted. Committee staff characterized Newbold as saying that clearances had been issued–despite objections–to people with “a wide range of serious disqualifying issues involving foreign influence, conflicts of interest, concerning personal conduct, financial problems, drug use, and criminal conduct.” READ THIS LIST"
Anderson Cooper Tears Into Trump for Doubling Down on His Charlottesville Remarks,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/anderson-cooper-tears-into-trump-for-doubling-down-on-his-charlottesville-remarks,"VERY FINE PEOPLE Anderson Cooper Tears Into Trump for Doubling Down on His Charlottesville Remarks “How many fine people arrived with combat boots and clubs and picked up torches and chanted Nazi slogans?” Cooper asked. Justin Baragona 04.26.19 10:28 PM ET
CNN anchor Anderson Cooper opened his broadcast Friday night by accusing President Trump of gaslighting the public on Charlottesville after the president doubled down on his defense of white supremacists by claiming that some of those who attended the Unite the Rally two summers ago were just protesting the taking down of a monument.
Speaking to reporters a day after former Vice President Joe Biden used Trump’s “very fine people” equivocation in his presidential campaign announcement, the president said he was referring to supporters of Confederate General Robert E. Lee at the time and “if you look at what I said, you will see that question was answered perfectly.""
Noting that it “doesn’t take much to bait President Trump” to self-destruct and revisit one of the lowest points of his presidency, Cooper pointed out that the rally wasn’t just about confederate statues but was instead a gathering of neo-Nazis and white nationalists , and was billed as such.
Showing video of torch-carrying marchers shouting “Jews will not replace us” and “blood and soil,” the CNN anchor took issue with the idea that there were “fine people on both sides.”
“How many fine people arrived with combat boots and clubs and picked up torches and chanted Nazi slogans?” Cooper asked. “That’s the question. And anti-Semitic ones as well? How many fine people who you know would do that?”
The president, he said, was asking everyone “to believe something contrary” to what we can see “with our own eyes and hear with our own ears” by claiming that people were just at the rally because they felt “very strongly” that “Robert E. Lee is a great general.”
“OK, those white supremacists and neo-Nazis with the tiki torches that you just saw were marching to the Robert E. Lee monument that he’s talking about,” Cooper said, before revisiting the president’s original 2017 remarks.
The Anderson Cooper 360 host finished his monologue by fact-checking the claim that the rally was about statues and monuments, showing posters and quoting a white supremacist organization’s communication promoting the event.
“Quote, although the rally was initially planned in support of the Lee monument which the Jew mayor and his Negroid deputy have marked for destruction, it has become something much bigger than that, now a historic rally which will serve as a rally point and battle cry for the rising alt-right movement.”
“Those are the ads they put out,” he concluded. “Those are some of the fine people the president claims were there.” READ THIS LIST"
NRA Suspends Top Lawyer While Oliver North Warns Group Could Lose Nonprofit Status,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/nra-suspends-top-lawyer-while-oliver-north-warns-group-could-lose-nonprofit-status,"exclusive Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast
Steve Hart, the longtime lawyer for the National Rifle Association board, has been suspended from that role, two people with knowledge of the move told The Daily Beast.
In addition, Col. Oliver North–who announced his departure from the powerful gun rights group this morning–has warned board members that the organization could lose its nonprofit status.
A spokesperson for the NRA’s outside law firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and neither did Hart. A lawyer for North declined to comment.
Hart represented the board for years, and his suspension came before North announced that he is stepping away from his leadership role at the organization after only six months on the job.
The lawyer’s ouster represents the departure of another senior, long-time NRA insider with detailed knowledge of the organization’s troubles. And it comes as internal turmoil and sniping rocks the gun-rights group.
On Friday, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times reported that NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre wrote a letter to the board claiming that North tried to blackmail him into leaving the organization. The NRA also claimed in an update to a lawsuit against its long-time advertising vendor, Ackerman McQueen, that North double-dipped by simultaneously taking a salary from the firm and being on contract with it to make a documentary series for NRATV.
North, meanwhile, told the board recently that he fears serious financial mismanagement by the NRA’s leadership. He recently wrote a letter to board members raising concerns and announcing the start of a crisis management committee. “I did this because I am deeply concerned that these allegations could threaten our nonprofit status,” North wrote, per a copy of the memo reviewed by The Daily Beast.
North also told board members he’d tasked the committee with investigating “allegations of financial misconduct related to Mr. LaPierre, which have been made in response to the NRA’s recently filed lawsuit against Ackerman McQueen.”
“We are facing a serious crisis,” North continued. “To date, my repeated efforts to inquire about the propriety of management’s financial decisions have consistently been rebuffed.”
“We need responsible leadership and advice from outside professionals to appropriately deal with this crisis,” he added. READ THIS LIST"

INDIANAPOLIS—In a surprising move, Oliver North announced that he has been ousted as president of the National Rifle Association, going on the offensive to warn that the powerful gun rights group is in “clear crisis.”
In a letter read by the group’s vice president Saturday morning to kick off the second day of the group’s annual meeting, North said that he will not be renominated to serve as NRA president as infighting and controversy have taken hold at the gun rights group’s annual meeting.
“Please know I hoped to be with you today as NRA president endorsed for reelection. I’m now informed that that will not happen,” he wrote.
North, who has been in the job six months, went on to attack the NRA law firm that filed a lawsuit against its leading ad firm. “There is a clear crisis” at the NRA regarding financial allegations, he wrote.
The announcement comes as The Daily Beast exclusively reported on Saturday that longtime NRA lawyer, Steve Hart, has been suspended. The dual departures of long-time high profile NRA insiders with knowledge of the organization's legal troubles come just days after the gun-gun group took shots North in the days leading up to its much-watched national meeting keynoted by President Donald Trump—the first sign of a internal shake up.
In a sign that something was afoot, Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s longtime CEO and leader, received a standing ovation at the beginning of the members meeting. He was seated next to Oliver North’s empty chair and placard.
North’s opening remarks were essentially a rebuke of his ouster, read by First Vice President Richard Childress to the thousands of members who had packed Lucas Oil Stadium, an NFL football arena in downtown Indianapolis for the popular event.
Childress said that he only learned that he would be reading the letter around 7 p.m. Friday night and asked the audience to bare with him.
“After resuming office as NRA president in September of 2018, I was confronted by NRA members and board members who expressed concern about the amount of money the NRA was paying to the Brewer law firm,” North wrote in his letter. “There is a clear crisis and it needs to be dealt with immediately and responsibly so the NRA can continue to focus on protecting our Second Amendment.”
In an updated version of a civil complaint filed April 24 in Virginia state court, the NRA made new allegations regarding North, a former Marine Corps lieutenant colonel perhaps best known for his role in the Iran-contra affair, and his relationship the company that runs NRATV.
The updated complaint alleges that not only did North not deliver on all of the material promised for NRATV but he allegedly garnered a salary from both the gun rights group and Ackerman McQueen, the advertising form that has worked with the advocacy group for three decades, at the same time.
On Thursday, LaPierre claimed in a letter published in the Wall Street Journal that North was trying to “oust him” in an alleged extortion attempt and would not comply with the threat.
“Delivered by a member of our Board on behalf of his employer, the exhortation was simple: resign or there will be destructive allegations made against me and the NRA,” LaPierre, who is also the group’s executive vice president, wrote in the letter.
In response, North wrote his own letter to the board on Thursday, defending his actions that were “for the good of the NRA.”
North, once a political commentator and Fox News host , also served as a staff member of the National Security Council during the Regan administration. He was later convicted on three felony accounts stemming from the affair involving an arms-for-hostages deal with Iran in which the proceeds were used to secretly arm a Contras rebel group in Nicaragua. The conviction was later overturned .
On May 7, 2018, the NRA announced that North would become the organization's next president after years of serving as a board member and appearing at the national conventions in 2007 and 2008.
“I've been on the NRA board for more than two decades. It was a great privilege to serve as your president this past year, an honor second to only serving our country as a U.S. Marine in combat,” he wrote in the Saturday letter.
On Saturday, New York Attorney General Letitia James also confirmed her office has launched an investigation into the NRA regarding the group's finances, a spokesperson confirmed to NPR.
“The Office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James has launched an investigation related to the National Rifle Association (NRA). As part of this investigation, the Attorney General has issued subpoenas,” the spokesperson said . According to NPR, the group received a document preservation notice in connection with the AG's investigation.
In response, an outside lawyer for the NRA told the news organization that the group is “ fully cooperat[ing] with any inquiry into its finances.”
“The NRA is prepared for this, and has full confidence in its accounting practices and commitment to good governance,” William A. Brewer III, an outside lawyer for the NRA, told the news organization on Saturday. READ THIS LIST"
At Least 15 Killed in Sri Lanka Police Raid Of Militants Linked to Easter Massacre,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/sri-lanka-at-least-15-killed-in-police-raid-of-militants-linked-to-easter-massacre,"At Least 15 Killed in Sri Lanka Police Raid Of Militants Linked to Easter Massacre The gunfight started Friday night after police tipped off soldiers about a suspected safe house. 04.27.19 10:17 AM ET REUTERS
At least 15 people, including six children, were killed Friday night when suspected militants set off a series of explosions and engaged cops in gunfire during a raid by Sri Lankan police in connection to the deadly Easter Sunday suicide bombings, authorities said.
Authorities told the AP they received a tip that members of the group associated with the coordinated terrorist bombings that killed more than 250 people last week were in a safe house near the town of Sammanthurai. When they arrived, militants “detonated three explosions and opened fire.”
The U.S. Department of State, citing possible secondary attacks, urged Americans to reconsider traveling to Sri Lanka and have ordered children of government workers to leave the country.
Most of the victims in the latest round of violence—which also included six men and three women—were killed in three bomb blasts that ripped apart the roof and one wall of the house, police said. One witness told CNN the explosion during the house “into fire.”
Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara told the AP that most the victims were “likely were militants” who blew themselves up in multiple suicide bombings. At least one civilian had been killed in the attack.
“A girl and a woman survived the explosion at the suspected safe house but were critically injured and being treated at a hospital,” Gunasekara said , who later revealed the two are related to the mastermind behind the bombings, Mohamed Hashim Mohamed Zahran.
Friday’s explosive confrontation comes amid a nationwide security crackdown widespread fear over the Easter Sunday bomb blasts at three churches and four hotels across Sri Lanka that left hundreds more injured in one of the worst bouts of violence in the island nation has seen since the civil war . Since the explosion which was claimed by ISIS as a response to mass killing of muslims in New Zealand, Sri Lankan police have warned civilians of possible further attacks.
“These vile attacks are a stark reminder of why the United States remains resolved in our fight to defeat terrorism” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement after the Sunday attacks, confirming that “several Americans” had also been killed.
Sri Lankan police have also began conducting raids and police curfews that have shut down areas of eastern Sri Lanka, while Catholic leaders announced last week Sunday Masses will be canceled “indefinitely.”
Earlier on Friday, during a series of raids a few miles from the shootout, authorities seized a large cache of explosives , including 100,000 ball bearings, ISIS uniforms, and black Islamic State-style flags.
Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena said Friday the new security measures, which he said were being used to identify and track people, have led to the arrest of 70 individuals with ISIS ties and has tracked another 70 suspects still at large.
“We had to declare an emergency situation to suppress terrorists and ensure a peaceful environment in the country,” the president said , defending the controversial methods that were also used during the Sri Lankran the civil war. “Every household in the country will be checked and lists of all residents made to ensure that no unknown person can live anywhere,” he vowed.
On Saturday, Maithripala Sirisena also requested for the police chief to step down following the suicide bombings for not sharing the advance warnings of the attacks on the island country, according to Reuters .
As previously reported by The Daily Beast , a Sri Lankan police official had alerted security officials in an advisory ten days ago before the attack about a threat on churches. The document, which was reviewed by The Daily Beast and is written in Sinhala, but is dated April 11 and clearly states in English in all caps, “Information of an alleged plan attack.” On Saturday, the AP reported the Indian Police also stumbled upon a detailed plot for the attack and altered Sri Lankan officials two weeks before the attack, but went unacknowledged.
The Defense secretary Hemesiri Fernando resigned earlier in the week for his role in why the warnings went unheeded, the inspector general of police Pujith Jayasundara has been holding on, until they find the suspects.
“He has refused to resign despite the president’s request,” one source told Reuters, adding that under the Sri Lanka constitution, only parliament can remove the police chief."

Four Boeing employees called in tips to a Federal Aviation Administration whistleblower hotline to report issues with technology on the 737 MAX-8 plane one day after the Ethiopian Airlines crash, CNN reports. The 737 MAX-8 has been involved in two crashes that killed 346 people in total, and have since been grounded worldwide. The former and current Boeing employees reportedly described issues related to the angle of attack sensor—a vane that measures the plane's angle in the air, and the anti-stall system called MCAS. One tip concerned a previously unreported issue of damage to the wiring of the angle of attack sensor due to a foreign object. The FAA told CNN it has reviewed the tips, and may be opening up an entirely new investigative angle. Directly after the Ethiopian Airlines crash investigators found that a malfunctioning angle of attack sensor was sending incorrect data to the MCAS system. Boeing's CEO will hold a news conference Monday following a shareholder meeting in Chicago. International civil aviation authorities are also meeting on Monday to discuss issues surrounding the 737 Max."

"Shooting at San Diego Area Synagogue, Children Among the Injured",www.thedailybeast.com,Audrey.McNamara@thedailybeast.com (Audrey McNamara) Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/san-diego-synagogue-shooting-multiple-people-including-children-injured-at-synagogue-chabad-of-poway-suspect-in-custody,"04.27.19 3:43 PM ET Denis Poroy
A 19-year-old man armed with an assault rifle walked into a suburban San Diego synagogue Saturday morning and opened fire, killing one person and injuring three others, including a child, in a mass shooting that the mayor cast as a “hate crime.”
The San Diego Sheriff's Office said that John Earnest of San Diego has been arrested in connection with the shooting at the Chabad of Poway and don’t believe there are any other suspects. Police said he has no prior contact with police and was being questioned by local detectives and local FBI agents Saturday afternoon.
Sheriff William Gore said authorities were looking into a rambling, multi-page manifesto that was published minutes before the shooting by a person with the same name, in which the writer claimed Jews were destroying whites and praised attacks in Pittsburgh and New Zealand.
“We are aware of his manifesto, which we are in the process of reviewing to determine its validity and authenticity,” Gore said, adding that the attack is being investigated as a homicide and authorities are looking into charges that include state hate crimes statutes and federal civil rights violations.
Authorities were also “looking into the possibility” of Earnest's involvement in a mosque fire in nearby Escondido last month, a claim that is made in the manifesto, Gore said.
More lives may have been spared in the shooting thanks to the work of an armed off-duty Border Patrol agent believed to be working as a security guard in the synagogue during the shooting. The guard, who has not been identified, returned fire as the suspect fled to his car, hitting the vehicle with several bullet holes.
Investigators were working to determine if Earnest left the scene because he was engaged by the Border Patrol agent. Gore said there were also some indications that Earnest’s gun “malfunctioned” after he fired several rounds.
“Sadly we are seeing this happen all too often around our country,” Gore said. “It’s tragic, especially when it happens here in our own backyard.”
The attack on the 33-year-old synagogue in Poway, a town of about 50,000 people located just northeast of San Diego, took place on the last day of Passover and exactly six months to the day after Robert Bowers, 46, allegedly entered the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh just after 10 a.m, reportedly shouting “all Jews must die” before opening fire and killing 11 people.
The Chabad center was founded in 1986 as part of the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement's international outreach efforts. It serves “Jews of all backgrounds who want to learn more about their Jewish roots,” according to their website, and like other Chabad centers, attracts a variety of congregants, many of whom are not traditionally religious.
The congregation according to an event listing the a was in the midst of a Passover Holiday Celebration that began at 11 a.m. and was set to end at 7 p.m. with a final Passover meal.
It was interrupted around 11:30 a.m. when Earnest allegedly entered the synagogue carrying an AR-15 type assault weapon and opened fire, striking four people, including a woman who was killed and two men and a girl who are all expected to survive.
Police said among those injured is Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, who was conducting service at the time and was shot in the hand. He was in surgery Saturday and was expected to survive.
Earnest was arrested without incident by San Diego police as he was fleeing the scene, Chief David Nisleit said.
A San Diego police officer en route to the scene overheard on the California Highway Patrol scanner that a suspect had allegedly called 911 to report that he was just involved in this shooting and gave authorities his location, Nisleit said.
As the officer was exiting the freeway, he clearly saw the suspect in his car, Nisleit said. “The suspect pulled over, jumped out of his car with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,” he said. “As the officer was placing this 19-year-old male into custody he clearly saw a rifle sitting on the front passenger seat of the suspect vehicle.”
The local FBI and ATF offices in San Diego said agents are working with local officials on the investigation.
Poway Mayor Steve Vaus, speaking on CNN, called the attack a “hate crime” based on “statements the shooter made when he entered” the building.
Gore said police have copies of the suspect’s social media posts and an alleged hate-filled manifesto he wrote right before the shooting, which would be reviewed “to determine the legitimacy of it and determine how exactly it plays into the investigation.”
The manifesto reviewed by The Daily Beast was created before the attack and the writer identifies himself as Earnest. A spokesperson for the sheriff's office declined to provide any additional details about the manifesto.
The manifesto was first shared on the toxic trolling board 8chan minutes before the suspect opened fire. It contains apparent misinformation and is clearly meant to be found and disseminated. (It uses the same question-and-answer format of the manifesto of the terrorist who attacked two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.)
The writer identifies himself as a Christian of European descent. While he eschews political labels, the writer repeats a far-right accusation that Jews seek to destroy the white race through immigration of non-whites. It is the same purported motive given by the man who allegedly killed 11 Jews at a Pittsburgh synagogue last October.
California State University San Marcos identified Earnest as one of its students in a statement released Saturday evening. “We are heartbroken by this tragedy, which was motivated by hate and anti-Semitism,” the school’s president, Karen Haynes, said, adding that the university is “dismayed and disheartened” by Earnest’s alleged involvement.
Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn, President Donald Trump expressed his “deepest sympathies” to the Poway congregation and “the people that were affected” in what “obviously... looks like a hate crime.”
“We are doing some very heavy research and we will see what comes up but it looks like a hate crime,” Trump said before heading to Wisconsin for a rally in protest of the annual White House Correspondent’s Dinner. “Hard to believe, hard to believe.” READ THIS LIST"

Trump Says He’s ‘Proud’ of His ‘Sick’ Sanctuary Cities Plan,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-says-hes-proud-of-his-sick-sanctuary-cities-plan,"ANYTHING FOR APPLAUSE Trump Says He’s ‘Proud’ of His ‘Sick’ Sanctuary Cities Plan He made the claim at the “very positive rally” he held instead of attending the “boring” White House Correspondents’ Dinner. 04.27.19 11:59 PM ET Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty
President Trump told a crowd of supporters on Saturday night that his administration is already transferring detained illegal migrants to sanctuary cities, despite the White House earlier playing down the idea.
Trump made the claim at his rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, an event that he’d promised would be “very positive,” unlike the White House Correspondents’ Dinner—which he skipped for the third year in a row.
In keeping with his well-worn playbook, Trump alternated between disparaging political opponents and highlighting his administration’s accomplishments. The rally featured a bevy of boo-lines.
Trump used his stage to claim victory over the “radical liberal democrats” who “put all their hopes behind their collusion delusion .”
His appearance in Wisconsin came just hours after a gunman entered a California synagogue and g unned down worshippers, killing one person and injuring three more. The alleged gunman published a hate-filled manifesto online before the attack claiming Jewish people are trying to eradicate the white race.
The president condemned the anti-Semitic shooting during his speech before moving on to other items on his agenda. He proudly announced that a recent White House plan to bus detained illegal migrants to sanctuary cities as political retribution was indeed his idea.
“Democrats also support sanctuary cities that release thousands of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets. In fact, they like the criminal aliens so much that when we are forced to release them into our country... we give them as many as they can handle,” he told the crowd.
“We’re sending many of them to sanctuary cities, thank you very much … They're not too happy about it. I'm proud to tell you that was actually my sick idea.”
The White House has not publicly confirmed that such a policy is currently being implemented.
Trump first began floating the idea earlier this month, in an apparent attempt to one-up Democrats who have opposed his harsh immigration policies in cities that have traditionally limited their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. A White House official quoted by The Washington Post at the time said the plan was just another “suggestion that was floated and rejected.”
Officials from sanctuary cities also backed Trump into a corner on the idea, saying they would welcome those migrants currently being detained.
“The city would be prepared to welcome these immigrants just as we have embraced our immigrant communities for decades,” Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney told The Daily Beast in a statement at the time. READ THIS LIST"

Inside London's Iconic Mental-Hospital-Turned-Hotel Restoration at Andaz Shoreditch,www.thedailybeast.com,Tim Johnson,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/andaz-shoreditch-inside-the-restoration-of-a-london-icon,"ROOM KEY Inside London's Iconic Mental-Hospital-Turned-Hotel Restoration at Andaz Shoreditch Once one of London’s most storied hotels, the Andaz Shoreditch has recently completed a multi-year renovation project. 04.28.19 12:30 AM ET Courtesy of Andaz London Liverpool Street/Hyatt
It was once one of London’s most storied hotels. Built in the East London neighborhood of Shoreditch by the Brothers Barry—Edward and Charles, Jr., who designed a number of 19th century English icons, including the Houses of Parliament—the Great Eastern Hotel opened in 1884. It was constructed on a storied site, the infamous former home of the Bethlehem Royal Hospital, also known as “Bedlam,” Britain’s first hospital for the mentally ill.
Over the years, the stylish, Gothic, red-brick hotel housed various luminaries, both real and fictional—including Van Helsing, Bram Stoker’s intrepid vampire hunter, who resided here in Stoker’s first Dracula novel. Postcards were produced of the hotel’s façade. Sea water was transported by train, so guests could enjoy healing salt-water baths.
But as Shoreditch devolved, so did the hotel, and by the time current owner, Sir Terence Conran, checked into the place in the 1980s, it had become a flophouse. “It was in the most disgraceful, derelict condition,” remembers Conran, a well-known designer and renaissance man. “They asked me, ‘how many hours do you want?’” So he bought the hotel, gutting and transforming it, reopening as the world’s first Andaz, Hyatt’s boutique brand.
And they’ve just undergone another extensive renovation, carried out in 19 stages and finished this past year with the completion of their 860-square-foot RED Suite, designed by Conran himself, spacious and comfortable and filled with personal touches. Given the historic nature of the hotel and the level of design work that has gone into it, the hotel was a shoo-in for Beast Travel’s twice-monthly hotel feature The New Room with a View . (Like other RED projects, 30 percent of the room rate is donated to help fight AIDS.)The suite, like the rest of the hotel, aims to reflect Shoreditch and all of East London, bringing the outside into its restaurants and 267 rooms—of which, no two are the same. The area was once a hub for industries like silk weaving and coffee, which was offloaded nearby from ships on the Thames, and those elements are reflected in the artwork and etchings. Larger than most in London, the rooms are also equipped with modern conveniences—including flat-screen TVs and, a new addition, large walk-in showers.
Bedlam even gets its due at the hotel’s Rakes Café Bar, adorned with A Rake’s Progress, eight works, reflecting eight stages of the mind, by 18th-century painter William Hogarth which trace the moral decline and ruin of Tom Rakewell—who ended up in the Bethlehem Royal. Rakes is divided into three sections—The Front Room, where DJs spin and people dance, The Lounge, a cushy, luxe space, perfect for a comfortable cocktail, and No. 3, a “secret room” for private parties. The original hotel was even built with two Masonic temples, and one of which, grand and strange, has been reopened and renovated—it’s now used for morning yoga,Game of Thrones-themed dinners, and Lady Gaga even did a photo shoot there.
And as this area of London revived over the past two decades, with hipsters moving in all around—building a nearby, semi-ironic bowling alley and lounges and bars and barbershops—that’s reflected, too, with photos of graffiti, and tattoo artwork embossed on headboards. Guests are encouraged to get outside and see this renaissance. I wandered down Brick Lane, long a destination for new immigrants and industry, from breweries to textile shops, and now home to that bowling alley, and cafes and craft beer bars, where hipsters and immigrants now live side-by-side.
I have lunch at the Old Spitalfields Market, which dates all the way back to 1638, and has traditionally traded in fruits and vegetables. Renovated in the last couple years, they still sell fresh produce out of Victorian buildings, but now also welcome those seeking antiques and vintage eyewear and handcrafted skincare products, plus 40-some food outlets, from street food and gourmet burgers to farm-to-table fare.
And I even take a street art tour, arranged by the hotel and led by a local graffiti artist. In addition to showing me his own work, Karim Samuels leads me down streets and around corners and down alleyways, giving the background on a number of other local paintings and their creators, explaining the different types of graffiti art, from simple tags to full-colour murals. At one point he gets a bit deep about the meaning behind it all, and the line that these artists still straddle between fashionable—and criminal. “Street art is analog social media,” he explains, with a smile. “People have been writing on walls for thousands of years—but try telling that to a judge.” We finish with the area’s pièce de résistance, a pink Porsche near Brick Lane painted by Banksy and, Samuels says, dropped here in the middle of the night, by crane.
I haven’t been doing anything so heroic as fighting vampires but, tired from the walking and saturated with information, I head back to the Andaz. Rather than seawater bath, there’s walk-in shower, and then a cocktail waiting for me at Rakes. And then a comfortable night in my unique room, far removed from the Bedlam of the bustling city outside. READ THIS LIST"
Le Train Bleu: The Luxury Train That Ended Up a Secret in Bloomingdale’s,www.thedailybeast.com,Allison McNearney,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/le-train-bleu-the-luxury-train-that-ended-up-a-secret-in-bloomingdales,"LOST MASTERPIECES Le Train Bleu: The Luxury Train That Ended Up a Secret in Bloomingdale’s Agatha Christie wrote a book inspired by Le Train Bleu, a luxury locomotive that transported the famous in the Jazz Age. Later, the train lived again as a secret NYC lunch spot. 04.28.19 12:29 AM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast
During the Jazz Age, the French Riviera was the place to be for anyone who claimed membership in or aspirations to the haut monde . From Saint Tropez to Nice and beyond, the smart and monied planned their vacations to the Côte d’Azur. If you were Coco Chanel or Cole Porter or Winston Churchill in the early 20th century following WWI, you would secure a coveted ticket to the French Riviera on Le Train Bleu.
Luxurious, exclusive, and an instant sensation, the overnight locomotive ferried the fashionable elite from Calais to the southern coast of France and, in the process, became an iconic fixture on the rails and in the imagination.
It inspired books, ballets, and gourmands, including a semi-hidden restaurant tucked away in a Gilded Age train car transplanted to the sixth floor of Bloomingdale’s. But all good things must come to an end and Le Train Bleu eventually blew its whistle for the last time. In 2016, the secret eatery atop Bloomingdale’s followed suit.
The British were the first to popularize the French Riviera, and they did so in the late 1700s on doctors’ orders. If your health was ailing in the mists of of England, a wellness retreat to the healing warmth and waters to the south was the perfect medicine. Flocks of ailing Brits began to descend on the French coast from November to April and soon became a nuisance for locals.
On The Land of Desire podcast , host Diana Stegall notes that, by the time Napoleon came to power, “the French were already sick of the sick Britons, writing that British doctors were ‘sending to our shores a colony of pale and listless English women and listless sons of nobility near death.’”
The flood of visitors never slowed, but in the 1830s they began coming for a new reason: pure pleasure. During this decade, the British began to embrace the coast as a leisure destination and the healthy well-to-do made regular trips along with their sickly brethren. But there was just one problem—it was really hard to get to the French Riviera.
That began to change in the late 1800s, when the Calais-Mediterranée Express made its debut on the rails courtesy of the company behind the famed Orient Express. Not only was the service more reliable between Calais and the towns on the French Riviera, but travelers could now make the journey in the comfort of sleeping cars.
It was a huge improvement for British travelers, who could board the train in Calais, on the northern French coast, around 1 p.m. in the afternoon, enjoy some socializing and a meal with their fellow passengers, repair to their berths for the evening, and then wake up the next morning to find themselves at their sunny destination.
It was in the years following the end of World War I that the French Riviera really took off. As Americans joined the British on the French coast, the fashionable vacation season was extended and the idea of a summer jaunt came into fashion.
“They tell me there is a woman living in a small frame house in a Montana village who expressed no intention whatever of going to Antibes this summer,” Alexander Woollcott wrote in Vanity Fair in 1929. “I have heard no explanation of this bizarre uniqueness of hers, have received, as yet, no details to account for what does seem at first blush a somewhat too studied effort to be conspicuous.” “It consisted of 10 exclusively first-class sleeping cars that were decked out in a midnight blue velvet upholstery with mahogany trim, and one upscale dining car that served five-course meals”
The Calais-Mediterranée Express took full advantage of the destination’s popularity. On December 9, 1922, the train company debuted a new look for one of their most popular routes.
The Calais-Mediterranée Express transformed into pure luxury on wheels. It consisted of 10 exclusively first-class sleeping cars that were decked out in a midnight blue velvet upholstery with mahogany trim, and one upscale dining car that served five-course meals. The exterior of what essentially was a five-star hotel was painted “a shimmering dark blue with gold accents,” according to Stegall, earning it a new name: Le Train Bleu.
The dazzling Le Train Bleu was almost instantly a hard-to-get ticket. It was also the only way for the social set to fashionably arrive at their vacation destinations on the coast. Coco Chanel, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald , Charlie Chaplin, and Edward VIII were among the most famous passengers.
Agatha Christie took a trip on Le Train Bleu and then published The Mystery of the Blue Train in 1928. Hercule Poirot solved the case of a dead American heiress and her missing ruby five years before Murder on the Orient Express was published.
In 1930, Woolf Barnato, the race car driver and chairman of Bentley staged a race to the Riviera against Le Train Bleu as something of a publicity stunt. He won by a matter of a few minutes and the Bentley Speed Six became known as the “Blue Train Bentley.”
In 1924 the famed Ballets Russes premiered a new ballet, Le Train Bleu , that explored the “shallowness of modern love” of the vacationing set on the coast. It was quite the one-act production. Chanel created the costumes , Picasso the curtain, Henri Laurens did the sets, and Jean Cocteau was the performance’s librettist.
The glamor of night trains began to dim following WWII as the convenience and popularity of air travel began to rise. While Le Train Bleu would not lose its name until 2003, it quickly ceased to be the status symbol and spectacle on the rails that it once had been. But its reputation remained.
In 1963, a grand restaurant in the Gare de Lyon was renamed Le Train Bleu after the famous train, and it continues to be a sought-after dinner reservation today. Its decor is an ode to the Belle Epoque, complete with sculptures and frescoes, crystal chandeliers and gilded touches. According to NPR's Sylvia Poggioli , it “is considered one of Paris' best preserved examples of that lavish fin de siecle architectural design.”
The restaurant made such an impression on Bloomingdale’s impresario Marvin S. Traub, that he decided to pay homage to the Parisian eatery and its forefather on wheels by opening a restaurant of his own . “The walls were lined with a dark-green velvet and mahogany panelling, the tables were covered in fancy linens and individual lamps, and the menus paid homage to the original locomotive”
Starting in 1979, in-the-know fashionistas would take their new acquisitions to the kitchen department in Bloomingdale’s, where they would find a nondescript, narrow staircase. After ascending to a platform, they would encounter an unusual site—an opulent train car sitting in a hidden nook on the sixth floor of the Manhattan building.
The semi-secret restaurant Le Train Bleu at Bloomingdale’s did justice to its forbears. The walls were lined with a dark-green velvet and mahogany panelling, the tables were covered in fancy linens and individual lamps, and the menus paid homage to the original locomotive. Luggage racks lined the walls giving the train car both a touch of nostalgia and a practical place to stash diners’ shopping bags.
As recently as 2014, Gawker named Le Train Bleu “The Best Restaurant in New York,” though the review poked fun at the somewhat tarnished clientele it catered to (“very old New Yorkers reliving the luxury travel accommodations of their youth”) and its somewhat dated space.
Only two years later, this iteration of Le Train Bleu also reached the end of its line. In 2016, Bloomingdale’s announced it would be shuttering the secret restaurant that many casual shoppers had never known existed.
While the era of luxurious train travel may have sadly come to an end, the spectacle of Le Train Bleu remains fixed in the lore of the French Riviera and of that magical, golden time when the globe was just beginning to open up to travel by all. Or, at least, by those who could afford a berth on Le Train Bleu. READ THIS LIST"
"Move Over, Kardashians. Pilots Are the Stars of Instagram",www.thedailybeast.com,Blake Montgomery,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/move-over-kardashians-pilots-are-the-stars-of-instagram,"STRIKE A POSE Move Over, Kardashians. Pilots Are the Stars of Instagram Airline pilots are Instagram sensations, with heaps of accounts counting hundreds of thousands of followers. But like reality TV, things aren't always what they seem. 04.28.19 12:23 AM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photo Getty
A photo from March 2018 appears to show Patrick Biedenkapp, an airline pilot who shares photos and videos with 522,000 Instagram followers as @pilotpatrick, hanging ten out a cockpit window with a selfie stick mid-flight. His hair, shirt, and sunglasses seem undisturbed by the wind.
Some commenters expressed adoration for Biedenkapp, a German with a well-behaved blond coif and an immaculate complexion, while others were skeptical. They questioned how he took the photo or outright accused him of posting a fake. He didn’t answer their queries or clarify where the photo came from. However, the airplane manufacturer Airbus, which is tagged in the photo, did.
“The image is clearly photoshopped and is not a real in-flight photo,” a representative told the Daily Beast.
Biedenkapp is part of a larger trend: airline pilots as Instagram sensations. Madeleine Schneider-Weiffenbach, who posts as @pilotmadeleine, boasts 1.1 million followers. The #pilot hashtag has 5.2 million tagged posts. Anas Amireh, who flies Airbus A350 planes out of London, has 390,000 as @pilotamireh followers and several dedicated fan pages. There’s enough pilot enthusiasm to sustain two huge accounts run by pilots named Maria — @mariathepilot, 462,000 followers, and @pilotmaria, 535,000.
“Everyone always wonders how pilots fly planes from Point A to Point B and what do we get to see/experience,” Amireh said via DM. “You can easily see this when you are looking at your passengers while they are boarding and the first thing they try to get [is] a closer view of is the flight deck.”
Dozens more have follower counts in the lesser hundreds or tens of thousands, and big-name airlines like Emirates and Lufthansa command millions. The appetite for aviation content, it seems, is vast.
Maria Petersson (@pilotmaria), who’s worked as a pilot for the past five years, said half of her travel is personal and half is for pilot work. While she’s working, she says, she doesn’t have much time to take photos except during the cruising section of the flight, and when she’s not, she pays for all her flights herself. She started the profile as a way to update friends after moving to Sicily to take her first job as a pilot.
The pilots’ photos can give the impression that a pilot’s life consists of looking hot in a uniform in sundry glamorous destinations. All beach, no office. The skill and training that being a pilot requires imbues thirst traps on hotel beds with an air of professionalism—if you were a pilot, you too might happen to be half-naked on a layover between flights.
As Business Insider wrote of @pilotmadeleine in 2017, “There's no shortage of lifestyle bloggers travelling the world, sharing their wanderlust-inducing pictures on Instagram to hoards of followers. But few of them have the knowledge of the globe that a pilot does—and a view from the cockpit.”
Or the Daily Mail : “Perks of the job! Stunning German pilot becomes the latest to flaunt her globe-trotting lifestyle in envy-inducing snaps.”
“People also like pilots because of the cool pictures we can post in our uniform, or even some topless shots for those who are in great shape!” said Paul Thon, a student pilot who posts as @paul.thepilot to 31,100 followers.
Petersson tries to warn her followers that all is not always as it seems. The path to becoming a commercial pilot for an airline involves trade school that can cost over $100,000, hundreds of hours of flight training, a tight job market, and routines that sometimes require waking up not long after you’ve gone to bed.
“People seem to see both jobs as easy and glamorous, but in reality being either one is hard work. I try to be as honest as I can about both, being a pilot nor travel is very glamorous,” Petersson said. “Being a pilot is hard work, early mornings, sweaty days, food prepping, getting your workout done at times your rather be sleeping, et cetera.”
Konstantinos Lambrou, who posts as @146bpm to 42,000 followers, assured his future passengers that he and other Instagram pilots he knows follow the “sterile cockpit rule.” It’s an informal standard adopted by the FAA that demands that crew members only perform essential duties below 10,000 feet. Even above that level, Lambrou said he doesn’t take pictures unless his co-captain has full control.
The pilot lifestyle lends itself well to being an influencer—travel the world and stay long enough in each locale to snap a selfie at sunset. Who goes more places than the people flying the planes?
“The misconceptions [about being a pilot and an Instagram influencer] are similar. We often think a pilot only travels for free, gets a good salary and gets plenty of holidays,” Thon said. “The reality is that we wake up early in the morning, have a lot of pressure on us, and the salary for a beginner pilot is quite low considering that most of us are heavily in debt.”
Fans eat it up, real or not. One commenter wrote to @pilotmaria “On one of your flights thx for letting me see the cockpit wanna be a pilot when I grow up cause of you!” @pilot_lindy (131,000 followers) offers a step-by-step guide of how to become a pilot on her blog. Every pilot who spoke to the Daily Beast said they receive dozens of DMs a week asking how to become a pilot.
Amireh said, “People came to the airport to tell me that they entered the flying academy or already became pilots” because of his page.
Instagram is a newly vital part of the travel industry as the social network swells beyond a billion users worldwide. Destinations with a good photo location can become overwhelmed with tourists if even a single Instagrammer with a large following snaps a picture there. Businesses know it: luxury hotels have dedicated pages for influencers to apply as advertising partners.
So pilots often act like typical Instagram influencers. They post sponsored content, recipes, and fitness inspiration. They’ll promote hotels or incorporate a skincare product into their routine. @pilotmadeleine and @pilotmaria sell Adobe Lightroom presets, electronic kits that auto-edit photos in Lightroom to follow a certain aesthetic. The former’s are so popular that she’s created a separate profile for them that’s gained tens of thousands of followers.
It’s unclear whether major airlines condone or even allow influencer activities like sponsored posts. American Airlines, the largest in the world, pointed to its social media policy when asked about pilots posting ads — employees are held both personally and professionally responsible for the content they post, leaving the final judgment up to interpretation.
The company did not respond to further questions about whether this policy precludes pilots creating sponsored content while on the job, as Petersson did with an ad for Breitling watches in a cockpit. She flies for the airline Next Generation, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, and said she earns more money from Instagram than she does as a pilot. Her work as an influencer allowed her to pay off $100,000 in student loans from pilot school.
Three of the other largest airlines in the world—Delta, United, and Lufthansa—did not respond to request for comment.
It’s easy to interpret an Instagram star’s photos as evidence of a carefree life, whether they’re a pilot or not. The realities are often more inelegant. One blogger couple made waves in 2015 for revealing that they financed the travel showcased on their Instagram account by scrubbing toilets for food, not even scraping together enough for bus travel. Other would-be influencers have gone into debt to make it big on Instagram.
“Most travel influencers aren't spending weeks and weeks at a given destination. It's more like a few days or even hours,” said Rachel Coleman, social media director at the travel booking site GetYourGuide and former director of social media at Conde Nast Traveler.
Petersson wrote in a 2018 blog post , “This isn’t a pilot’s life, it’s social media,” disclaiming to her followers that collaborations with brands like GoPro afforded her free, glamorous travel, rather than her job as her handle would suggest.
“Pilot life is hard work, the company that I fly for we don’t even do layovers,” she wrote. “We get 25 minutes on the ground at our destination where we set up everything for our return flight and if we’re fast enough manage to snap a selfie out through the window.”
The post echoes a widely covered exit from social media by a 19-year-old Australian model, Essena O’Neill , in 2016. She abandoned accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers, clearing them of any content, and changed her Instagram bio to read, “social media is not real life.""
Petersson told her followers it’s unrealistic to act on the aspirational nature of her posts: “I am writing this post because I don’t want anyone to invest between Euro 60-120,000 on a pilot training and think that you will be doing exactly what I am doing.” READ THIS LIST"
Do You Have to Get Circumcised to Become Jewish?,www.thedailybeast.com,Candida Moss,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/do-you-have-to-get-circumcised-to-become-jewish,"OF CUTTING AND COVENANTS Do You Have to Get Circumcised to Become Jewish? From the story of Ruth to the Apostle Paul, the ancients hotly debated whether women and men could convert to Judaism without circumcision. 04.28.19 12:21 AM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Getty
There was trouble in first-century Galatia. During his missionary journeys, the Apostle Paul had taught non-Jews in the area that in order to become a follower of Jesus, the Jewish messiah, they need only be baptized and they would be saved by faith. Circumcision, he argued, was not necessary for salvation.
His arguments elicited strong reactions from other Jewish followers of Jesus and from the new converts themselves and led Paul to write the sharpest of his letters, the biblical letter to the Galatians. For most of history we have assumed that Paul’s position was a radical and completely innovative suggestion, but now a new book suggests that Paul wasn’t the only Jew to open up Judaism to uncircumcised people.
It’s easy to see why Paul’s converts in Galatia thought that circumcision was important. After all, according to the Bible , circumcision is the sign of the covenant that Abraham forged with God. It’s an identity marker. If men wish to enter into this covenant then, surely, they have to sacrifice a piece of themselves too? It’s the reason that Jewish infants continue to be circumcised today and it’s a principle for which, according to the books of the Maccabees , Jews have been willing to sacrifice their lives.
Paul has his own answers to this question, but the problem is older than Paul, especially when it comes to the status of women. Not every human body has a foreskin. What are foreskin-deficient people (mostly women) to do? Are they semi-members like Ruth (the legendary grandmother of King David)? Are they non-members? Can women really be converts?
It was something of a problem. As Jill Hicks-Keeton , an assistant professor at the University of Oklahoma, told The Daily Beast, “Women in antiquity were incorporated into the kinship group of their husbands, a move that included venerating that group's god or gods. Jewish circumcision was (as now) only available to male bodies and so was not available as a mechanism of incorporation available to women. Women, such as the biblical character of Ruth, were added or not depending on their usefulness for male Israelite identity. Women’s inclusion was not fully theorized until the rabbis developed the criterion of matrilineal descent for Jewishness.”
In the recently released Arguing with Aseneth: Gentile Access to Israel’s Living God in Jewish Antiquity, Hicks-Keeton argues that Judaism wasn’t the restrictive tradition that people sometimes assume it is. Her book discusses the story of Joseph and Aseneth, a turn-of-the-era Jewish romance novel that reimagines the story of the wife of the patriarch Joseph (he of technicolored dreamcoat fame). In Genesis 41, Asenath is a minor character: the daughter of an Egyptian priest Potiphera, she becomes Joseph’s wife and bears him two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. And this is pretty much all the Bible tells us about her. She doesn’t speak, she doesn’t act, she just bears sons. Written centuries after the book of Genesis, the anonymous Joseph and Aseneth fleshes out the details and, in the process, uses her story to work out how to incorporate foreign non-Jewish women into the covenant the Jews made with God.
In the story, Aseneth (now a beautiful virginal main character with an ‘e’ in her name) marries Joseph and abandons the Egyptian gods of her ancestors. Joseph initially rejects her because of her polytheism, but it all works out in the end: she locks herself in a tower, becomes a monotheistic devotee of Joseph’s God, and is visited by an angel who accepts her repentance and conversion. The way the story presents Aseneth is different from the way foreign women were presented in the Bible and offers a model for how gentiles might be fully accepted into the community. As Hicks-Keeton told me: “ Joseph and Aseneth re-imagines a female character from Genesis as a mythic model and mediator of God’s covenant to future penitents. The tale writes into Israel's sacred story … a precedent for inclusion of non-Jews in the people of God by using a woman, whose body is ineligible for circumcision, to imagine a way in for gentiles as gentiles.”
This doesn’t mean that everyone in the Hellenistic period agreed with the author of Joseph and Aseneth . Hicks Keeton told me that while people did not argue with the book directly there were others, like the author of the book of Jubilees, who took a hard line on the inclusion of outsiders. And, of course, Paul encountered his own share of strong opposition. “The apostle Paul was not the most radical thinker in antiquity who wanted to incorporate non-Jews into the people of God.”
What all of this means is that before Paul began to argue with the Galatians (and other leaders in the Jesus movement) about the value of circumcision, there were other Jews who were already navigating the difficult question of how to accept non-Jews into the community without demanding circumcision. “What Joseph and Aseneth shows us,” Hicks Keeton said, “is that the apostle Paul was not the most radical thinker in antiquity who wanted to incorporate non-Jews into the people of God. Paul was not special. Christians did not invent gentile inclusion in Israel.”
This, in turn, should have a knock-on effect for how we think about Judaism in general. Hicks-Keeton put it this way, “Many people stereotype Judaism as a particularistic tradition and see Christianity as the positive foil because they see it as open and universalistic. Joseph and Aseneth shows us that this caricature is unsustainable historically.” READ THIS LIST"
