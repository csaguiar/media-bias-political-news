Washington, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Wayne Rooney was sent off as D.C. United's unbeaten start to the season came to an emphatic end with a 4-0 home defeat to Los Angeles FC on Saturday.
Former England and Manchester United star Rooney was shown a red card on 52 minutes after a dangerous, studs-up tackle on LAFC's Uruguayan striker Diego Rossi, who would go on to complete a clinical hat-trick.
Referee Robert Sibiga initially looked to have given Rooney a reprieve, brandishing only a yellow card for the tackle.
But after consulting the Video Assistant Referee, Sibiga changed the yellow to red, leaving United skipper Rooney to trudge off the field without protest .
""Yeah I think it was a red card,"" Rooney said after the game. ""I've lunged. I tried to win the ball, and I've caught the player. I have no arguments."" Rooney's red completed a miserable afternoon for D.C. United, who by that stage were trailing 3-0 against a vastly superior LAFC side.
The eagerly anticipated battle between the leading teams in the Eastern Conference and Western Conference turned into a one-sided affair at Washington 's Audi Field, with Los Angeles ruthlessly exploiting some sloppy play from the home side.
The game was effectively over in little more than half an hour, with Los Angeles surging into a 3-0 lead thanks to two goals from Rossi and a curling effort from Mexico international Carlos Vela.
United had been under pressure from the outset, and were fortunate not to have gone a goal down after only nine minutes when Leonardo Jara was adjudged to have handled in the area to concede a penalty.
Vela stepped up for the spot-kick but was thwarted by a fine block from United goalkeeper Bill Hamid. Vela's attempted follow-up from the rebound hit a post .
Los Angeles did not have long to wait for the opener, however, and in the 16th minute Vela made amends with the game's opening goal.
A mix-up in midfield saw D.C. United cough up possession cheaply, allowing Adama Diomande to thread a pass through to Vela, who coolly took his time before placing a curling shot beyond Hamid.
Vela turned creator for LAFC's second, picking out Rossi with a delightful low cross with the outside of his left foot allowing the Uruguayan to jab home the finish for 2-0.
Rossi added his second in the 32nd minute, capitalizing on good work from Mark Anthony Kaye to curl in a superb right-foot finish to all but seal the win.
Rooney's dismissal early in the second half snuffed out any faint hope of a comeback, and Rossi duly added insult to injury by completing his hat-trick to make it 4-0 on 76 minutes.
LAFC moved four points clear of Los Angeles Galaxy at the top of the Western Conference, with 16 points from six games."

Relations between India and Pakistan significantly aggravated following Pulwama attack in Kashmir on February 14 where at least 44 Indian paramilitary soldiers were killed.
After the attack , India accused Pakistan of having a ""direct hand"" in the incident and blamed the neighbouring nation for harbouring and protecting terrorists.
Pakistan had denied its involvement in the attack while Prime Minister Imran Khan has asured India of thorough action if it provides any actionable intelligence.
This was followed by February 26 airstrike by Indian Air Force against what New Delhi said was a camp of Jaish-e-Mohammad, considered a terrorist group by India , and located on the Pakistani soil across the Line of Control.
The Pakistani military, in retaliation, shot down two Indian warplanes in the disputed region of Kashmir on February 27."

The Indian national carrier re-routed some of its flights which had to take a longer flight path over Mumbai to reach the US and Europe .
""We are saving 15 minutes on our US and Europe-bound flights since Pakistan opened some of its airspace from last Thursday,"" a senior Air India official said.
Pakistan had closed its airspace since the Indian Air Force (IAF) strikes in Balakot on February 26. The move had adversely affected international flights to and from India , with Air India being a major victim.
Flights from across the world were either cancelled or re-routed since the closure was announced on February 27. Pakistan partially opened its airspace, only for the flights bound for the country.
Air India , which operates 33 weekly services to the US and 66 to Europe , had curtailed operations due to the airspace closure. It had clubbed together several US and Europe-bound flights.
Flights to the US and Europe are now diverted over Mumbai and then northwards over the Arabian Sea.
The flights from the US had been taking a longer route, which had extended their duration on the already long-haul journeys.
According to a report, Air India had to face a loss of Rs 6 billion since March 16 due to closure of Pakistan’s airspace. India’s distance with Western countries had increased by four more hours due to suspension of Pakistan’s airspace. This had caused difficulty to passengers as well."

So much for the trope that universities are a bastion of free speech -- or of liberal ""political correctness,"" for that matter.
In 2018, four Republican-controlled state governments pushed through legislation that sought to deploy law enforcement to force a fallacious ""balance"" into campus debates and speech. Pushed by ultraconservative groups like the Goldwater Institute and big-money Republican donors like the Mercer family, under the guise of protecting the rights of controversial conservative speakers, the new laws actually seek to punish dissent.

Now the president of the University of Arizona is defending his school’s decision to seek criminal charges against three students who protested the presence of Border Patrol agents on campus. No violence took place during the March 19 demonstration, yet the school concluded that the students broke Arizona law when they publicly “harassed” the agents, a Class 1 misdemeanor that could result in up to six months of jail time.
“From the letter of the law, I think the chief obviously deliberated about this, in a very tough situation, and decided that the actions of the students did disrupt the presentation that was being made,” university president Robert Robbins told the Arizona Republic after the charges were made public on Thursday.
20-year-old Denisse Moreno Melchor, 22-year-old Mariel Alexandra Bustamante and 27-year-old Marianna Ariel Coles-Curtis were finally charged this week after video of their demonstration was widely shared by conservative outlets like Judicial Watch and Breitbart as proof that college campuses are hotbeds of radical left-wing thought that stifles free speech. Art Del Cueto, a border patrol union official, publicly called for the students to be investigated. At least so far, citizens cannot legally infringe upon another's free speech. So Arizona officials instead charged the students with interfering with the peaceful conduct of an educational institution and threatening and intimidating the agents.
In a video that went viral in conservative circles, two agents can be seen giving a presentation inside a classroom while people in the hallway call them “murderers” and “an extension of the KKK.” Students then chant “murder patrol” as the agents leave campus. According to the New York Times , on the same day these border officials were on the university’s Tucson campus, a local family was arrested and detained just a few miles away.
Robbins said he agreed with the decision to criminally charge the two students because “free speech doesn’t give one the right to disrupt an ongoing presentation in a classroom.” Free speech advocates, however, strongly disagree.
""Filing criminal charges against students for campus speech that may be protected by the First Amendment will chill protected student speech,"" the free speech advocacy group FIRE said in a statement. ""Students will rationally decide to self-censor rather than risk the possibility of criminal charges.” Advertisement:
The Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of speech untrammeled by government interference. It emphatically does not guarantee the right to an agreeable audience or a ""respectful"" hearing, especially in a public forum like a state university. Heckling, jeering, booing and similar ""disruptive"" acts are all constitutionally protected freedom of speech. The government is allowed to place reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on protests, but the possibility of jail time for peaceful protest certainly appears egregious. Furthermore, while students can be punished for disruptive behavior, such punishment cannot be based on the content of their message. It is clear here that the objection was to the content of the message of the protesters. While traditionalists may be unnerved by the controversial tactic known as ""de-platforming"" -- which amounts to drowning out an objectionable message, or denying it an audience -- it is without question a valid form of protest and an exercise of free speech.
As this case demonstrates, right-wing astroturfing about threats to free speech on college campuses is nothing but projection. In a recent essay for Salon, journalist and Yale professor Jim Sleeper aptly described it as “a lavishly-funded, brilliantly orchestrated, politically poisonous lie about college students and their deans that riveted millions of Americans during the run-up to the 2016 election.”
As future Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell's infamous 1972 memo dictated, propagating this lie is a centerpiece of the right-wing strategy to dismantle civil institutions to allow for corporate dominance. While college Republicans and elite liberals alike bemoan the rise of “social justice warriors” and “safe spaces,” modern conservatism has now become a sort of ""protected class"" on college campuses and dissenting voices have been criminalized.
“I’m always using my voice. That’s a must as a Latina who has citizenship,” Bustamante told the Guardian this week. She said she has received death threats and a visit from law enforcement at her home following her protest of the Border Patrol. “I never thought I’d face repercussions for doing so.” Advertisement:
The supposed free speech warriors who have fanned the flames of moral panic over perceived threats to campus discourse will likely have little to say now that the arm of the law has been used to silence student protests. For his part, Robbins, the university president, released a more cautious second letter -- following a first one that praised the Border Patrol's presence on campus -- confirming that he was aware of threats issued against people on ""both sides"" of the issue. Perhaps he didn't mean to echo President Trump's rhetoric after the Charlottesville riots of 2017, but the resonance is unmistakable. Sophia Tesfaye

Of course it'll pass. Bits and pieces, over time, eventually all adding up to the same thing. It's been going on for years. These things tend to accelerate. Graph taxation, state expenditure, regulatory control and notice how they start off at a low level and grow like a rolling snowball. Just imagine a green snowball. Ain't it pretty.
That ball has been rolling for quite some time now. Pretty soon it'll be hard to jump out of its way.
All over the world governments -- democratically elected governments -- in plain sight, as a result of long consultation processes, have implemented everything from carbon taxes to plastic bag bans. Most importantly, the Green agenda has been taught in all levels of education for at least a couple of decades. Children go on class trips for Earth Day and to protest climate change. It's official education policy and it's the default worldview of the millions of new voters being pumped out of the schools each and every year. This isn't a future event; this is now. It's a done deal; it just hasn't been voted on yet. But that's a minor detail. reply to this log in or register to reply TBlakely | 4.8.19 @ 2:24PM | #

I would like to try to pierce the informational bubble, most comments agree heavily with the author of the piece.. In doing so, I'm venturing out of my own usual bubble to try to read, consume and reciprocate with new information.
The author's underlining main conclusion, ""the green new deal is anti-democratic"" is based off of past perception and general cynical opinion from anything coming from the public sector in my opinion. I can tell you, that it isn't based on at least two things:
1) The green new deal policy proposal. I know this because there is no green new deal policy proposal.
2) The green new deal resolution that was introduced in congress. This was a resolution, its more like a vision statement, a set of principles, a guidance document, an outline of the scope and solutions they are working towards. All of the details are non-existent, and ""THE GREEN NEW DEAL"" is basically the brain-child of one organization. Whereas a general green new deal is any number of policy discussions and prescriptions that anyone that believes we should motivate as much US resources as possible to transition to a green economy might support. reply to this log in or register to reply Sevo | | #

The main idea put forth is that the advocates of the Green new deal will look to coercive govt policies in general. I admit that is absolutely an approach that some might take. But its actually completely the opposite of the actual text of the resolution that started this debate.
To realize that point, I want to encourage everyone to at least consume some information from the actual architects of the green new deal.
https://www.vox.com/ezra-klein-show-podcast
The episode entitled ""Meet the policy architect of the green new deal""
A huge portion of this conversation is explicitly about how the final polices she is developing have crucial democratic input, where she meets with all the stakeholders, the wonks, the impacted communities, the legislatures, the skeptics, etc. She explains how important it is to not create polices that harm the same communities that fossil fuel pollution and transitions disproportionately. Now this is an extremely complicated task, and we at this point have no idea how true any final plan will be to those goals. But the emphasis and care is there.
I read this reason article because I was in search of critics of a green new deal, a general idea that I am in much favor of. I am hoping you'll do the same. reply to this log in or register to reply Sevo | | #

Two people physically attacked worshippers leaving a Jewish center and synagogue in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Friday night and made antisemitic comments during their attack.Rabbi Uriel Husni, the head of the Mikdash Yosef Jewish center in the capital, told The Jerusalem Post on Sunday that the attack was staged by a man and a woman against worshippers leaving the center in the Palermo neighborhood of the city, as people were leaving following the end of the Friday night Shabbat service. Most of the congregants, the majority of whom are young men and women, had already left, while Husni remained behind with approximately 10 to 15 people.According to the rabbi, they then saw a woman who had not been at the prayer service and who was acting strangely exit the Jewish center and shouted at him “Jew, give me food.”When Husni said he did not have any food, she retorted saying “we need to kill you Jews,” cursed the group in other antisemitic ways, and physically assaulted some members of the group. At the same time, a man who appeared to be associated with the woman took out glass bottles from a cardboard box and approached the group threatening to attack them with the bottles. The rabbi said he stepped in front of the group as did a security guard at the center and came face to face with the assailant who spat in the security guard’s face. The man then threw some unidentified liquid on the ground and the guard slipped over. One of the individuals from the group of youths who attended the prayer service went to help him, and the assailant threw a large rock at him, which Husni managed to block with his foot, injuring himself slightly. A non-Jewish neighbor entered the fray and sprayed pepper spray at the woman, causing her to end her assault and eventually flee. The male then ran away with Husni in pursuit. After running for several blocks they encountered the police who briefly detained the man and then released him. Husni told the Post that he would file a complaint with the police over the attack on Monday morning. The rabbi said that he was convinced the attack was antisemitic in nature given the antisemitic curses the man and woman hurled at them. Mikdash Yosef is a Jewish center in Buenos Aires for young Jewish men and women which works both as a Jewish outreach organization bringing young Jews closer to Judaism as well as helping troubled youth who have become involved in drugs and alcohol. The AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires said it expressed its “total solidarity,” with the members of the Mikdash Yosef community and demanded that the police and state officials look into the attack.“Prevention and safety are fundamental pillars not to neglect or neglect at any time and under any circumstances. No situation of hatred, discrimination and violence can be tolerated within the framework of a democratic society,” AMIA said in a statement on its website.

Turkey: Netanyahu 'irresponsible' on West Bank annexation,www.jpost.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Turkey-Netanyahu-irresponsible-on-West-Bank-annexation-seeking-votes-586002,"2 minute read. b Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlut Cavusoglu attends a news conference in Goslar, Germany..

Western democracies must take a stand against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s talk of annexing the West Bank , Ibrahim Kalin, the spokesman for Turkish President Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, said on Sunday.“Will western democracies react or will they keep appeasing? Shame on them all!,” Kalin said. Netanyahu made his statement in a Channel 12 interview, just three day before the April 9th election. It’s the first time he has spoken of annexing West Bank settlements.Kalin said, this is “Yet another example of how Netanyahu uses electoral politics to justify occupation and undermine the two-state solution. If he is re-elected, will this be a triumph of ‘democracy’ or occupation?,” Kalin charged. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted that annexation of the West Bank was illegal. West Bank is Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in violation of int’l law. Prime Minister Netanyahu’s irresponsible statement to seek votes just before the Israeli general elections cannot and will not change this fact. — Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu (@MevlutCavusoglu) April 7, 2019 “West Bank is Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in violation of [international] law. Prime Minister Netanyahu’s irresponsible statement to seek votes just before the Israeli general elections cannot and will not change this fact,” he added.Palestinian officials also reacted strongly to the statement.“Such a statement by Netanyahu is not surprising. Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity,” Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said. Dr. Saeb Erekat: “Such a statement by Netanyahu is not surprising. Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity.. (1/2) https://t.co/tJ2UOAJWMT — Dr. Saeb Erakat الدكتور صائب عريقات (@ErakatSaeb) April 6, 2019 “We’ll continue to pursue our rights through international forums, including the international criminal court, until we achieve our long overdue justice,"" he added.The Palestinian Authority has already asked the International Criminal Court to open a war crimes suite against Israeli settlement activity.Israel has long argued that such activity is not illegal. Netanyahu has always spoken of the importance of Judea and Samaria to Israel and of his refusal to uproot any of the settlements there. Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan during a the defensive Six-Day War in 1967, but has never annexed that territory to Israel. The 1993 Oslo Accords divided the West Bank, placing Areas A and B under the autonomy of the Palestinian Authority and Area C under the military and civil control of the IDF.All West Bank settlements are located in Area C.On Saturday night Netanyahu said, he would apply sovereignty to West Bank settlements including the isolated ones.

HASAKA - The paramedics' log at al-Hol camp in eastern Syria lists the injuries and ailments of infants rushed from the battlefield to its crowded, dirty clinic: malnourishment, stunted growth, broken leg.Those in critical need – mostly emaciated babies born in war to the wives of dead Islamic State militants – are taken to the nearest hospital, a bumpy two-hour drive away. Other people cram into a waiting room with a tin roof in a growing queue for basic medical treatment. At the hospital, staff have had to build two portacabins on the roof that serve as a makeshift ward for the treatment of malnourished babies, crammed sometimes two or three to a cot.Lower floors are filled with teenagers missing limbs and women with shrapnel and bullet wounds.The exodus during intense fighting of more than 60,000 people from Islamic State's final redoubt of Baghouz is overwhelming medical staff in eastern Syria who struggle to cope at the camp and ill-equipped hospitals.Scores of people, mostly children, have died on the 150-mile (240-kilometer) journey to al-Hol or soon after arriving, aid groups say.""My son has a dislocated hip. He needs an operation urgently,"" said Umm Mohammed, a veiled 33-year-old woman holding an expressionless six-month-old boy at the camp.""Medics keep saying they have more urgent cases to deal with - wounds and shrapnel injuries.""In the waiting area, dozens of people who mostly left Baghouz during a brief truce last month, arranged for civilians and surrendering militants to evacuate, sit on wooden benches or the concrete floor. Children in wheelchairs watch while babies scream as they are bandaged or given injections.US-backed forces declared the defeat in March of Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate – the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria – after militants were driven out of the village of Baghouz where they made a months-long last stand.The intense bombardment and fighting to dislodge the Sunni Islamist extremist group cost countless lives and wounded many more people, including the wives of fighters, their children, IS supporters and other civilians trapped by the militants in the enclave.Those who evacuated in recent weeks have strained healthcare in Kurdish-run areas of eastern Syria beyond capacity.In the clinic at al-Hol, which is hosting more than 70,000 people displaced by violence, many people wore crude casts. One woman said she did not have enough painkillers for a wound to her hand – a long metal rod from the explosion that wounded her and killed three relatives was still lodged in her knuckle.""I just want an X-ray at the hospital,"" she said, giving her name as Umm Ahmed. STARVING CHILDREN OF ISLAMIC STATE But local hospitals can take only the most severe cases.In one room at the hospital in the nearby town of Hasaka, 19-year-old Baraa al-Kurdi, the wife of a Syrian Islamic State member, lay motionless next to a boy with third-degree burns covering his head.""I was hit in the head by shrapnel,"" Kurdi said quietly. ""We were next to a car packed with ammunition and explosives, including suicide belts ready for fighters to use.""My husband was killed. My daughter is one month old – she's upstairs in the babies' ward.""Kurdi's daughter was one of the few non-foreign infants in the ward.Others, many blond or with Asian features, lay quietly in their cots with cheekbones showing and eyes sunken into their sockets from malnutrition. The patients' register listed the names their mothers gave the hospital – Ali Azerbaijani, Ali al-Uzbeki, Mohamed Skramo, a Norwegian name.Many who remained in Baghouz until the end of the fighting were die-hard supporters of Islamic State who flocked from all over the world to support its violent interpretation of Islam.A number of European countries have refused to take back citizens who joined ISIS, putting additional strain on local authorities to deal with prisoners and patients.""Children from the camp are arriving night and day. We currently have more than 70 babies being treated for malnutrition,"" a nurse in the ward said.She and other hospital staff declined to be named or for the hospital to be identified, fearing reprisals for treating the children of IS fighters.""Most cases are treated and then returned to the camp. A few have died. We're doing out best but had limited resources even before this influx.""More than 200 people have died on their way to al-Hol or after arriving in the camp in recent months, according to the International Rescue Committee. It said this week that around 30 to 50 cases every day were referred to local hospitals.""We get 30 ambulances arriving each day,"" a local health official said, also declining to be named.""There's aid from international organizations for those from Baghouz. They're mostly foreign. We can barely provide healthcare for our own.""

KARACHI - Pakistan has ""reliable intelligence"" that India will attack again this month, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said on Sunday, as tension over a February standoff between the two nuclear-armed neighbors had appeared to ease.The attack could take place between April 16 and 20, he said, adding that Pakistan had told the five permanent members of the UN Security Council of its concerns. A suicide car bombing by Pakistan-based militants in Indian-controlled Kashmir killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police on Feb. 14 and the risk of conflict rose dramatically on Feb. 27, when India launched an air strike on what it said was a militant training base.The following day Pakistan shot down an Indian fighter jet and captured its pilot who was later released.""We have reliable intelligence that India is planning a new attack on Pakistan. As per our information this could take place between April 16 and 20,"" Qureshi told reporters in his hometown of Multan.He did not elaborate on what evidence Pakistan had or how he could be so specific with the timing, but he said Prime Minister Imran Khan had agreed to share the information with the country.India's foreign office didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.Khan blamed India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for ""whipping up war hysteria"" over claims that India shot down a Pakistani F-16 during the February standoff.India said it, too, had shot down a Pakistani aircraft and the air force displayed pieces of a missile that it said had been fired by a Pakistani F-16 before it went down.The success of Indian air strikes on a camp of the Jaish-e-Mohammed militant group in northwestern Pakistan has also been thrown into doubt after satellite images showed little sign of damage.Pakistan closed its airspace amid the standoff but most commercial air traffic has since resumed and major airports have opened.

Germany’s government will pull the plug at the end of 2019 on public funding for a radical pro-Iranian-regime organization- the Islamic Community of Shi'ite Communities of Germany - that is packed with antisemitic representatives who urge the destruction of Israel.After a series of exposés in Germany’s top selling paper Bild , the newspaper reported on Thursday that the interior ministry announced in a letter the stoppage of funds for the Shi'ite umbrella organization. Institutions in Hamburg that are controlled by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei fall under the rubric of the organization. The Free Democratic Party blasted the government for failing to earlier stop the funding of the Shi'ite association and for being “clueless about Islamism” in connection with the Iranian clerical regime.Germany’s intelligence agency classifies the Islamic Center in Hamburg - a member of the Shiite organization - as an “instrument” of Khamenei in the federal republic. The association is funded by Germany’s family ministry and the European Union. The German federal government declared the Shi'ite umbrella organization to be “influenced by extremists.”The Bild wrote that Germany's decision “comes around $426,037 too late” in 2019. In 2017, the newspaper reported thatthe government provided $317,454 to the organization to allegedly “counter extremism.”Substantial funds continued to flow in 2018 to the pro-Iranian-regime association.Members of the association materially support the al-Quds Day worldwide demonstration to protest Israel’s existence, with buses and recruitment efforts. In June, 1,600 anti-Israel demonstrators turned out in Berlin at the al-Quds rally.Ayatollah Hamid Reza Torabi, a representative of Khamenei, appeared at this year’s rally in Berlin. Torabi heads the Islamic Academy of Germany – part of the Iranian regime-owned Islamic Center of Hamburg – and is a chief organizer of the al-Quds event.In 2017, then-German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel welcomed Torabi to a ministry event promoting “religious peace.”Germany’s government said that the chairman of the Shi'ite umbrella group Mahmud Khalilzadeh is ""a member of the political and religious establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran.” The Bild , according to Germany’s government, wrote that important positions of the Shi'ite group are held by pro-Iranian regime and pro-Hezbollah members, who openly advocate the destruction of the Jewish state.In 2017, the group launched attacks against homosexuality. The Jerusalem Post reported in January that Iran’s regime publicly hanged a man on an anti-gay charge.MP and foreign policy spokesman for the Free Democratic Party, Dr. Bijan Djir-Sarai, told Bild : ""I am pleased that the federal government is finally phasing out funding by the end of the year. However, there should not have been any funding for such a propaganda center from the outset.""Chancellor Angela Merkel’s administration has defied calls from Israel and the US to outlaw Hezbollah’s so-called political wing in Germany. Hezbollah is Iran’s chief strategic partner in its war against the Jewish state. Merkel refuses to shut down Hezbollah centers in the city-state of Bremen and in the city of Münster in North Rhine-Westphalia.The Al-Mustafa Center in Bremen raises funds for Hezbollah, according to a Bremen intelligence report reviewed by the Post .According to a North Rhine-Westphalia intelligence report, the Imam Mahdi Center operates as a pro-Hezbollah center to spread radical jihadi ideology and lethal antisemitism.

Gaza fisherman given jail sentences for smuggling explosives into Strip,www.jpost.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Gaza-fisherman-given-jail-sentences-for-smuggling-explosives-into-Strip-585995,"Arab-Israeli Conflict Gaza fisherman given jail sentences for smuggling explosives into Strip Two fishermen were sentenced to 13 and eight years, respectively, for smuggling explosives into the costal enclave from Egypt.

Two fishermen in Gaza were sentenced to eight and 13 years in prison, respectively, following a conviction on counts of smuggling bags weighing hundreds of kilograms into the Strip from Egypt.The Beersheba District Court accepted the position of the State Prosecutor's Office and imposed the sentences on Sunday. According to the indictment, the defendants Hamis Araishi and Mamdouh Bachar were connected with Fadi Baker, whose trial is ongoing, and smuggled in dozens of bags of explosives weighing hundreds of kilograms in a boat from Egypt to the Gaza Strip, as well as bags of tobacco. In addition, during the course of 2014, Araishi decided to carry out a suicide attack, and for this purpose, the accused acquired hand grenades and scoped out the border with Israel. During Operation Protective Edge, he realized that the location where he wanted to carry out the attack had already been exposed by IDF forces and therefore decided not to carry out the attack. During the appeals stage, Attorney Shira Harlap of the Southern District Attorney's Office asked the court to impose significant prison sentences alongside high fines for the defendants. She argued the severity of the offenses in which the defendants were convicted and the protected values that underlie the offenses - state security and the safety of its citizens- come, “at a time when Israel is in a daily struggle against terrorist organizations operating against IDF soldiers and residents of the state.”""In order to make money, the defendants smuggled explosives, through which the terrorists manufacture weapons used for terrorist attacks against soldiers,"" she added, “and thus the pair helped arm terrorist organizations.""The District Court, headed by Judge Natan Zlochover, accepted the position of the State Prosecutor's Office and sentenced Araishi to 13 years in prison and Bachar to 8 years in prison.In addition, the defendants were given suspended sentences and a fine of NIS 30,000 each. ""Gaza is a fertile ground for terror operations against Israel and the various organizations are united in a consistent desire to improve the capabilities of the terrorist attack in Israel and do everything possible to equip them with weapons of mass destruction and sabotage,"" the ruling states.

"A Mysterious Infection, Spanning the Globe in a Climate of Secrecy - The New York Times - BPC News",britishpakistanis.online,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://britishpakistanis.online/a-mysterious-infection-spanning-the-globe-in-a-climate-of-secrecy-the-new-york-times/,"
Candida auris was discovered in 2009 in the infected ear of a 70-year-old Japanese woman.
AUSTRALIA By The New York Times | Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Emerging Microbes & Infections; Clinical Infectious Diseases; Journal of Infection; Mycoses; Doherty Institute. Image from Kazuo Satoh et al., Microbiology and Immunology ‘No need’ to tell the public
In late 2015, Dr. Johanna Rhodes, an infectious disease expert at Imperial College London, got a panicked call from the Royal Brompton Hospital, a British medical center outside London. C. auris had taken root there months earlier, and the hospital couldn’t clear it.
“‘We have no idea where it’s coming from. We’ve never heard of it. It’s just spread like wildfire,’” Dr. Rhodes said she was told. She agreed to help the hospital identify the fungus’s genetic profile and clean it from rooms.
Under her direction, hospital workers used a special device to spray aerosolized hydrogen peroxide around a room used for a patient with C. auris, the theory being that the vapor would scour each nook and cranny. They left the device going for a week. Then they put a “settle plate” in the middle of the room with a gel at the bottom that would serve as a place for any surviving microbes to grow, Dr. Rhodes said.
Only one organism grew back. C. auris.
It was spreading, but word of it was not. The hospital, a specialty lung and heart center that draws wealthy patients from the Middle East and around Europe, alerted the British government and told infected patients, but made no public announcement.
“There was no need to put out a news release during the outbreak,” said Oliver Wilkinson, a spokesman for the hospital.
This hushed panic is playing out in hospitals around the world. Individual institutions and national, state and local governments have been reluctant to publicize outbreaks of resistant infections, arguing there is no point in scaring patients — or prospective ones. Image “Somehow, it made a jump almost seemingly simultaneously, and seemed to spread and it is drug resistant, which is really mind-boggling,” said Dr. Snigdha Vallabhaneni, a fungal expert and epidemiologist at the C.D.C. Credit Melissa Golden for The New York Times
Dr. Silke Schelenz, Royal Brompton’s infectious disease specialist, found the lack of urgency from the government and hospital in the early stages of the outbreak “very, very frustrating.”
“They obviously didn’t want to lose reputation,” Dr. Schelenz said. “It hadn’t impacted our surgical outcomes.”
By the end of June 2016, a scientific paper reported “an ongoing outbreak of 50 C. auris cases” at Royal Brompton, and the hospital took an extraordinary step: It shut down its I.C.U. for 11 days, moving intensive care patients to another floor, again with no announcement.
Days later the hospital finally acknowledged to a newspaper that it had a problem. A headline in The Daily Telegraph warned, “Intensive Care Unit Closed After Deadly New Superbug Emerges in the U.K.” (Later research said there were eventually 72 total cases, though some patients were only carriers and were not infected by the fungus.)
Yet the issue remained little known internationally, while an even bigger outbreak had begun in Valencia, Spain, at the 992-bed Hospital Universitari i Politècnic La Fe. There, unbeknown to the public or unaffected patients, 372 people were colonized — meaning they had the germ on their body but were not sick with it — and 85 developed bloodstream infections. A paper in the journal Mycoses reported that 41 percent of the infected patients died within 30 days.
A statement from the hospital said it was not necessarily C. auris that killed them. “It is very difficult to discern whether patients die from the pathogen or with it, since they are patients with many underlying diseases and in very serious general condition,” the statement said.
As with Royal Brompton, the hospital in Spain did not make any public announcement. It still has not.
One author of the article in Mycoses, a doctor at the hospital, said in an email that the hospital did not want him to speak to journalists because it “is concerned about the public image of the hospital.”
The secrecy infuriates patient advocates, who say people have a right to know if there is an outbreak so they can decide whether to go to a hospital, particularly when dealing with a nonurgent matter, like elective surgery. Image Outside the Royal Brompton Hospital near London. By June 2016, the hospital had seen at least 50 “proven or possible” cases of C. auris, and decided to shut down its intensive care unit for 11 days to address the contamination.

“Why the heck are we reading about an outbreak almost a year and a half later — and not have it front-page news the day after it happens?” said Dr. Kevin Kavanagh, a physician in Kentucky and board chairman of Health Watch USA , a nonprofit patient advocacy group. “You wouldn’t tolerate this at a restaurant with a food poisoning outbreak.”
Health officials say that disclosing outbreaks frightens patients about a situation they can do nothing about, particularly when the risks are unclear.
“It’s hard enough with these organisms for health care providers to wrap their heads around it,” said Dr. Anna Yaffee, a former C.D.C. outbreak investigator who dealt with resistant infection outbreaks in Kentucky in which the hospitals were not publicly disclosed. “It’s really impossible to message to the public.”
Officials in London did alert the C.D.C. to the Royal Brompton outbreak while it was occurring. And the C.D.C. realized it needed to get the word to American hospitals. On June 24, 2016, the C.D.C. blasted a nationwide warning to hospitals and medical groups and set up an email address, , to field queries. Dr. Snigdha Vallabhaneni, a key member of the fungal team, expected to get a trickle —“maybe a message every month.”
Instead, within weeks, her inbox exploded. Coming to America
In the United States, 587 cases of people having contracted C. auris have been reported, concentrated with 309 in New York, 104 in New Jersey and 144 in Illinois, according to the C.D.C.
The symptoms — fever, aches and fatigue — are seemingly ordinary, but when a person gets infected, particularly someone already unhealthy, such commonplace symptoms can be fatal.
The earliest known case in the United States involved a woman who arrived at a New York hospital on May 6, 2013, seeking care for respiratory failure. She was 61 and from the United Arab Emirates, and she died a week later, after testing positive for the fungus. At the time, the hospital hadn’t thought much of it, but three years later, it sent the case to the C.D.C. after reading the agency’s June 2016 advisory. Candida Auris by State Most cases in the United States have been in nursing homes in New York City, Chicago and New Jersey.

Uneasy Hangs the Head That Wears a Crown: The Lessons Donald Trump Needs to Learn from William Shakespeare,www.therussophile.org,Ashley Roberts,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/uneasy-hangs-the-head-that-wears-a-crown-the-lessons-donald-trump-needs-to-learn-from-william-shakespeare.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Now that President Donald Trump has finally been exonerated from the always farcical Big Lie of Collusion with Russia in the 2016 election, the US leader had better watch out: The Deep State will really go after him now that it’s supposed Soft Coup plot has failed.
Trump needs to recognize he is a modern version of Shakespeare’s King Henry IV, a monarch who can never afford to rest.
The forces opposed to Trump and his decent, sensible 2016 campaign vision of defusing tensions with Russia worked viciously, relentlessly and long to discredit the 45th President of the United States before he could even get going. The idea that they are now going to sit back like good losers because their entire pyramid of lies on Collusion with Russia has been exposed is ludicrous.
The two years of hysteria in fact were far from unsuccessful. They failed to topple Trump from office or separate and discredit him with his potent domestic political base. But they certainly prevented him from working openly and constructively with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the ongoing bloodbaths in Syria and Yemen that Trump inherited and to reduce global nuclear tensions.
Instead, the United States continues to plunge ever more deeply into reckless, unconditional support for the dangerously volatile, irresponsible and local regimes in Georgia and Ukraine. To Otto von Bismarck and George Kennan alike this would have been incomprehensible. They would have regarded it as insane. So would Franklin D Roosevelt, who was slandered by ignorant Know Nothings for three quarters of a century because he recognized that destroying Nazism and preserving the peace of the world with the Soviet Union were more important than guaranteeing the borders and internal politics of Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
On unexpectedly winning power, President Trump was entirely serious in his commitment to “drain the swamp” of Washington: That is the real reason the old US establishment hated him so much. The hysterical lies about a totally fictional and absurd “collusion” nevertheless pinned him down on the defensive for two years – half a full presidential term.
This forced Trump to obsess on defensive politics. He managed to push through many of the deregulation and other economic reforms he desired and started to renegotiate multinational trade agreements with the rest of the world. But he never had the chance to take the offensive against any or all of his domestic political enemies. Now he will certainly try to.
In reaction, they will be even more desperate, extreme and hysterical now they have been forced on the defensive than they were when they took the offensive against the president.
Trump needs to watch out. He has defied the US security establishment in ways no president has dared to do since John F. Kennedy. And behind his public posturing, Trump has never been a fool. Much of his tacking to the militaristic right on issues from Russia to China may well be seen as a recognition that he has to yield to many Deep State pressures to prevent the number and power of his enemies isolating him and becoming overwhelming. Richard Nixon, after all, was only forced to leave office when he had alienated most of both the liberal left and the hardline right against him.
Trump is right to celebrate the collapse of the Russia Collusion narrative against him. And he should certainly be urged to drop John Bolton especially as his national security adviser. The peace of the world still depends fundamentally on the Washington and Moscow steering clear of direct conflict and constructively and cautiously managing relations with each other.
But the most dangerous thing Trump could now do is to let down his guard. His many enemies are still out there, seething with hatred and frustration, eager to assault him with new, ever more poisonous and fantastic lies.
Trump may enjoy a brief lull while his coalition of enemies licks their wounds and humiliations in the shadows. And it may take them some time – probably weeks rather than months – to come up with their next set of new lies. Or the next set of assaults may be more direct.
The greatest danger remains in foreign affairs where Trump has allowed himself to be stripped of loyal colleagues like Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. Secretary of Defense James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly are now both gone, and so far they are irreplaceable. Both men were Marine generals with strong ties to the Establishment. But they were also experienced steady figures of caution and honor. Trump’s back is a lot less safe without them there to guard it.
William Shakespeare would have understood Trump’s dilemma perfectly.
We forget how Shakespeare’s historical tragedies were also political thrillers all filled with mind-bogglingly complex plots and intrigues. Whenever one intrigue failed, the villains – and even the heroes – simply moved on to concoct a new one.
That was power politics in Renaissance royal courts as Shakespeare understood it. He would have made a perfect National Security Adviser in 21 st Century Washington.

AMMAN, April 7. /TASS/. The easiest way to resolve Syria’s Rukban camp issue is to put an end to the unlawful US occupation of the Syrian territory, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated on the outcomes of the talks with his Jordan colleague Ayman Safadi.
“I think that the easiest and most effective choice would be to put an end to the unlawful occupation of this territory by the United States,” he noted. “There is a Russian-Jordanian operative staff on refugees in Amman. We discuss the issue of dismantling the camp there, and the US participates in this effort sometimes. I hope that they will choose a more constructive approach to the resolution of this pressing issue for Jordan”.
The US military is cooperating with illegal armed groups in the Al-Tanf zone, Lavrov added.
“The Americans have announced the establishment of some safety zone in the Al-Tanf area with a 55-kilometer radius. It is unclear what they base their illegal presence there on: it is basically occupation. The Rukban camp is within this area. There is a lot of illegal armed groups there, and the Americans are gladly cooperating with them, as far as I understand, to help them recover their strength,” he said.

Blocking aid to flood-hit Iran displays US malevolence: ِDefense minister,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/blocking-aid-to-flood-hit-iran-displays-us-malevolence-%d9%90defense-minister.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Iran’s Defense Minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami says the United States’ attempts to block international humanitarian aid from entering flood-hit Iran lays bare America’s malevolence.
Addressing employees at the Defense Ministry in Tehran on Sunday, Brig. Gen. Hatami blasted the administration of US President Donald Trump for seeking to hinder shipments of relief supplies to the Iranian regions devastated by unprecedented floods.
“They (the Americans) once again demonstrated their malevolence and the depth of their enmity toward the great nation of the Islamic Iran,” he said. “They proved that — contrary to their media propaganda — they are not just opposed to the Islamic establishment but [are prepared to] inhibit the delivery of the most basic items needed to save the lives of flood-stricken people.”
According to the latest death tally provided by the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS), 70 people have died in the flash floods that affected 1,889 cities, villages, and mountainous roads in 31 provinces of Iran over the past weeks.
Iran’s Army, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), voluntary groups, and locals have all mobilized to provide relief aid to the flood-hit areas.
Iran says the US has frozen the bank accounts of the IRCS as part of its unilateral sanctions against the Iranian people, making it almost impossible for foreign aid to reach the flood victims.
Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has described those US attempts as “economic terrorism.” FAKE NEWS: @SecPompeo claim that US “ready to assist @ifrc , which would direct money through Iranian Red Crescent for relief”

German boats arrive, France to start aid dispatch
Meanwhile, a consignment of 40 boats donated by the German Red Cross have been delivered to the IRCS. The consignment also includes 281 special rescue equipment such as flood clothes, helmets, vests, boots, shoe, etc.
The boats and rescue equipment are expected to be sent to the southwestern province of Khuzestan.
Additionally, France’s Foreign Ministry has said that the country will send 12 tons of humanitarian aid material — including 114 pumps — to Iran’s flood-hit regions. It said the first shipment would be sent in the coming days.

A photo provided by IRNA on April 7, 2019 shows Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Major General Mohammad Baqeri (R) and his Iraqi counterpart, Lieutenant General Othman al-Ghanimi, in Tehran.
Iran’s top military commander says the country and its neighbor Iraq have agreed to cooperate in the area of air defense to fend off the challenges facing their respective air spaces.
Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Major General Mohammad Baqeri made the announcement to reporters following a meeting in Tehran with his visiting Iraqi counterpart, Lieutenant General Othman al-Ghanimi, Tasnim News Agency reported on Sunday.
The cooperation, Baqeri said, will be aimed at confronting aerial threats.
The meeting addressed “the integrated defense of Iran and Iraq’s skies, because we might sense threats coming from the direction of [our] western borders,” he added.
“Accordingly, it was agreed that the countries’ air defense sectors work together and more coordination be made in this regard,” the Iranian commander said.
Baqeri said the two sides also agreed on potential training cooperation, the transferring of Iran’s defensive experiences to Iraq, and joint military exercises. Agreements on these, he added, will be finalized during a future visit by the Iraqi military chief.
Ghanimi was in the Iranian capital as part of a delegation accompanying Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi. On Saturday, the delegation met with Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani.
Baqeri cited the Iraqi commander as saying that Baghdad would be exercising stricter control on the United States’ military presence on its soil.
The American forces are only there to train Iraqis and their activities are under the Iraqi Army’s oversight, Baqeri added, citing al-Ghanimi.
In his meeting with Ghanimi, Ayatollah Khamenei had stressed that the Iraqi government should make sure that US forces leave Iraq as soon as possible.

Two protests took place in Venezuela on April 6 th – one in support of the opposition, while the other against imperialism and in support of the Maduro government.
US-Proclaimed President Juan Guaido praised the turnout at the opposition-organized protest. Hoy quedó en evidencia que Venezuela perdió el miedo. Hemos hablado muy claro: estamos unidos y movilizados.
La victoria es de Venezuela, de la democracia, y falta poco para que juntos la conquistemos en las calles.

“It was evident Today that Venezuela lost its fear. We Have spoken very clearly: we are united and mobilized. The victory is from Venezuela, from democracy, and we are close enough to conquer it in the streets together. Of Course Our country is worth it, #VamosVenezuela”
This followed a decision by the National Constituent Assembly (ANC) of Venezuela from April 2nd, in which it approved a decree to revoke Juan Guaido’s political immunity and to continue prosecution against him for leaving the country despite a ban by the Supreme Court and for inciting violance.
The president of the ANC, Diosdado Cabello, read the decree authorizing “the prosecution of the citizen Juan Gerardo Antonio Guaido Marquez (…) in accordance with the provisions of Article 200 of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela”.
“The continuation of the trial is formally authorized and that our justice, in accordance with the Constitution and the law, is in charge of applying the mechanisms established in the different criminal procedural codes.”

On April 5 th , the US Treasury sanctioned the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, the PdVSA, by blocking 34 of its vessels. Treasury sanctions companies operating in the oil sector of the Venezuelan economy and transporting oil to Cuba https://t.co/embRDwNov6
— Treasury Department (@USTreasury) April 5, 2019
This is a result of the OFAC identifying one of the vessels as transporting crude oil from Venezuela to Cuba, despite the opposition-controlled National Assembly voting to ban all such transfers.
“Despina Andrianna is a crude oil tanker (IMO: 9182667) that delivered crude oil from Venezuela to Cuba during February and March of 2019.”
“Cuba has been an underlying force fueling Venezuela’s descent into crisis. Treasury is taking action against vessels and entities transporting oil, providing a lifeline to keep the illegitimate Maduro regime afloat,” said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “Cuba continues to profit from, and prop up, the illegitimate Maduro regime through oil-for-repression schemes as they attempt to keep Maduro in power. The United States remains committed to a transition to democracy in Venezuela and to holding the Cuban regime accountable for its direct involvement in Venezuela’s demise.”
In response to the sanctions, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza condemned the actions and said that “while the U.S. government boasts of defending economic and commercial principles, it announced sanctions today against Venezuelan vessels and transportation in order to affect the delivery of oil to its sister Republic of Cuba.”
He also posted an official statement by the Venezuelan government categorically rejecting the new round of US economic attacks.

— Jorge Arreaza M (@jaarreaza) April 6, 2019
“The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela categorically rejects the new attack by the Government of the United States of America against the Venezuelan oil industry and its economic sovereignty.”
Arreaza called the sanctions a violation of the country’s “most basic economic and commercial rights, and questions how “a member-country of the World Trade Organization” and so-called “defender of liberal principles” would impose such measures.
“[The sanctions] aim to do harm, not only to the countries of Venezuela and Cuba, but also the businesses and commercial associations that should instead benefit from international protection,” Arreaza added.
This all followed an order by Maduro to set the Venezuelan military on high alert, after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov vowed that “Venezuela will not become 2 nd Syria.”
Furthermore, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad likened the two countries and said that they both fight against US imperialism and that neither would lose against it.

southfront.org Cue 3. Click to see full-size image
On April 1 st , Toyota unveiled its newest basketball robot that can land 3-point shots.
[embedded content]
[embedded content]
The 207-centimeter (six-foot, 10-inch)-tall machine made five of eight 3-point shots in a demonstration in Tokyo, a ratio its engineers say is worse than usual.
Toyota Motor Corp.’s robot, called Cue 3, computes as a three-dimensional image where the basket is, using sensors on its torso, and adjusts motors inside its arm and knees to give the shot the right angle and propulsion for a swish.
Cue 3′s name is supposed to reflect the idea the technology can serve as a cue, or signal of great things to come, according to Toyota.
This reinforces the trend in developing human-shaped and human-liked robots that can interact in the real world with people, rather than simply programmed mechanical arms that can only work in factories.
Yudai Baba, a Japanese basketball player, took part in the demonstration and also missed a couple of shots. If the robot could learn a few more tricks, he was ready to accept the robot on the team, he said.
“We human players are still better for now,” he said.
Stanford University Professor Oussama Khatib, who directs the university’s robotics lab, said Cue 3 demonstrates complex activities such as using sensors and nimble computation in real-time in what he called “visual feedback.”
To shoot hoops, the robot must have a good vision system, be able to compute the ball’s path then execute the shot, he said in a telephone interview.
“What Toyota is doing here is really bringing the top capabilities in perception with the top capabilities in control to have robots perform something that is really challenging,” Khatib said.
The robot will be showcased once more on April 10 th , in the B-League against Alvark Tokyo vs Sunrockers Shibuya. Approximately 5 months after Cue 2 appeared for the first time.
Separately, on March 28 th , Boston Dynamics unveiled its newest robot, “Handle,” which resembles a bird and used to move large boxes in a warehouse.
[embedded content]
The 6 feet tall (approximately 180 cm) and weighing 230 pounds, the wheeled machine glides across a warehouse floor with ease, demonstrating its ability to pick up and move large boxes using what appear to be suction cups at the end of a long neck. It’s referred to as “Handle.” and, according to the company, was designed to carry up to 33 pounds while maneuvering in tight spaces.
“Handle is a robot that combines the rough-terrain capability of legs with the efficiency of wheels,” a description of the machine on the company’s website says . “It uses many of the same principles for dynamics, balance, and mobile manipulation found in the quadruped and biped robots we build, but with only 10 actuated joints, it is significantly less complex.”
On Twitter , the company said that “Handle” represents their effort in logistics.
On YouTube, where the video has already garnered upwards of 2,000,000, reaction to the robot was focused on its ability to replace human workers and unleash violent chaos.
Another interesting development was made by Dorabot.

It attempts to solve the problem of machine learning, and that it requires machine teaching. So, the company developed a smart robot that can teach other robots.
Also, Misty Robotics also claim to have solved the problem of robots being challenged by climbing stairs.

Soft Robotics also provided a glimpse into their soft automation, showing how a robot can perform detailed and gentle actions.

The State Of The Libyan Government of National Accord’s Air Force,www.therussophile.org,dim27348,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-state-of-the-libyan-government-of-national-accords-air-force.html/,"Ever since the NATO intervention in Libya in 2011, the Libyan Air Force, under the control of the Libyan Government of National Accord (LGNA), has seen its capabilities deteriorate.
Most of the airfield were damaged by NATO airstrikes, and the same goes for much of its aircraft. Prior to the intervention, the country had a large number of helicopters and combat aircraft, but since then only a few remain capable of even flying in the air.
To try and tackle the problem, Tripoli called in Ukrainian specialists to assist in restoration.
In December 2014, a group of specialists arrived in the country from the “Odessa Aircraft Repair Plant”, which began to restore aircraft technology. First of all, two MiG-23ML fighters from the Rassvet Libya group, one of the key forces in the army of the LGNA, were repaired and put into operation. Both fighter jets carried out strikes against positions of ISIS militants. Restored MiG-23ML, Click to see full-size image
In addition, work began on the restoration of two MiG-25 and one MiG-25 UB aircraft. Combat aircraft of this type were mainly used for reconnaissance of enemy positions from the air. In May 2015, one of them was lost. MiG-25. Click to see full-size image
The main air power of the LGNA became light attack aircraft, repurposed from the L-39ZO training aircraft, produced in Czechoslovakia and the G-2 Galeb, produced in Yugoslavia.
The Dawn of Libya group had five G-2 Galebs and 2 L-39ZO aircraft at its disposal. A further 12 aircraft of the type were restored by the Ukrainian specialists. Out of these, 14 aircrafts were based in Misrata, from where the Dawn of Libya operates.
Several more L-39ZOs were stationed at Mitiga airbase in Tripoli and were not actively involved in hostilities. In the spring of 2015, all available aircraft in combat readiness, as well as two Mi-24 helicopters from the air base in Misrata were available for air strikes, both against ISIS militants and supporters of Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA). G-2 Galeb. Click to see full-size image
By the summer of 2016, the resource of the Tripoli MiG-23 and MiG-25 supporters in service was seriously exhausted. The main role of strike aircraft in the GNA forces became the L-39ZO. Despite the aircraft having mediocre combat characteristics, combat losses were avoided. Only one aircraft was lost due to an accident.
The L-39ZO, were equipped with C-5 NURSs and containers with GSh-23L aviation cannons and operated from altitudes above 2,000 meters to avoid destruction from the ground.
Under these conditions, it became clear that launches of NURS from such heights was ineffective. Often missiles simply did not come out of the blocks because of their pitiful state.
In comparison, the GSH-23L combat vehicle did quite well in fighting the most common targets.
The G-2 Galebs attacked targets by way of large-caliber machine guns. The use of aerial strikes from the training aircraft was difficult, because it wasn’t adapted for the purpose. L-39ZO. Click to see full-size image.
In 2019, according to the report, the aerial force of the LGNA is represented by two combat-capable MiG-23ML fighter jets, one MiG-25, 5 G-2 Galeb, and approximately 13 L-39ZO light attack aircraft.
In addition, there are also 5 SIAI SF-260 training aircraft. The GNA air force also has 8 Mi-24 and Mi-35 attack helicopters, which can deliver effective airstrikes on enemy positions, but not all of them are capable of flight. Reportedly, between 2 and 4 of the attack helicopters are actually combat-ready.
According to other sources, the GNA air force operates nine L-39ZO light attack aircraft, two Mig-23ML fighters and one Mi-24 gunship helicopter. Most of these warplanes are stationed in Misurata air base.
Haftar’s LNA is not threatened by the L-39ZO, and the only challenge to them are the MiG-23ML fighter jets and the MiG-25.
The LNA possesses ZPU-2 and ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft installations and the Kvadrat air defense missile system. Their main force is primarily made up of MiG-21 and MiG-23 fighter jets, against which the L-39ZO has little hope.
The LNA has a clear advantage as it operates two Mirage F1 fighter jets, twelve Mig-21 fighter jets, three Mig-23ML fighter bombers and a Su-22 fighter bomber.
To make things worse for the GNA air force, in addition to worn-out and outdated equipment, it also has a serious lack of personnel. Most of the pilots are above 50 years old, which in terms of fighter jet pilots is above retirement age. It should be noted that the LNA face the same problem in terms of flight personnel.

US Census struggles with ‘white’ racial category,www.therussophile.org,fwmstaff,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/us-census-struggles-with-white-racial-category.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Some 3 million people of Southwest Asian, Middle Eastern or North African descent live in the United States, according to an analysis of US Census Bureau data. But are they “white”?
In past US census surveys, more than 80 percent in these immigrants called themselves “white”, according to the analysis. Los Angeles is home to most of these immigrants where more than 350 000 of them live, the analysis by the Los Angeles Times showed.
Arab and Iranian communities do not want to categorised as “white” however and they have lobbied the bureau for a separate racial category denoting people of Middle Eastern or North African descent.
In 2018, the bureau stated that it would not be including the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) category for the census. Instead, the next survey will require that participants who previously checked “white” or “black”, to state their “origins” for the first time. On the new forms, Lebanese and Egyptian immigrants may be classified as “white”.
But many complain that they identify as people of colour. “The bureau’s move was seen as a blow to a group already grappling with feelings of invisibility,” the LA Times reported. “We are our own community,” the executive director of the Arab American Civic Council in Anaheim, California complained. “It’s as if we don’t count.”
Racial activists argue that the “white” label will damage claims of diversity. Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute, said being “white” has “deprived our community of access to basic services and rights,” such as funding and grants.
Government research from 2015 showed that Middle Eastern and North African people would check the MENA box if given the option. The analysis found that more than 80 percent of individuals of Southwest Asian, Middle Eastern or North African descent, had called themselves “white” in past census surveys.
Prior to the 2010 census, the Arab and Iranian communities in Southern California lobbied against whiteness however: “Check it right, you ain’t white!”
But counting the MENA immigrants as whites has slowed down the rate at which the non-white percentage of the US is increasing, thus making immigration seem like less of a problem.

The Number Of Americans With “No Religion” Has Soared 266% Over The Last 3 Decades,www.therussophile.org,Michael Snyder,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-number-of-americans-with-no-religion-has-soared-266-over-the-last-3-decades.html/,"Authored by James George Jatras via The Strategic Culture Foundation:
Well, that didn’t take long! No sooner had Robert Torquemada Mueller wrapped up his obscenely expensive inquisition without finding any so-called collusion with Russia than the obstacles to rapprochement between Washington and Moscow immediately dissipated. Calls for a new détente issued from sound thinkers such as Daniel R. DePetris of The American Conservative (Trump now has his “first opportunity to settle on a Russia policy without the risk of an extreme political backlash”) and Srdja Trifkovic of Chronicles :
‘Now that the Russian Collusion Myth has been revealed to be a mendacious conspiracy by the Deep State, the Democratic Party and the media, President Donald Trump needs to move on with his election promise to improve relations with Moscow. That is a geopolitical and civilizational necessity.’
The undeniable wisdom of such recommendations was instantly recognized by the Washington establishment. Not only did Democrats and Never-Trump Republicans back off their Nazi-Putin paranoia , Trump’s own team, starting with National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rushed copies of DePetris’ and Trifkovic’s musings onto their boss’s desk.
The most striking (though, oddly, little commented upon) evidence of the now-liberated Trump administration’s beeline towards a new realist overture towards Moscow was explicit US recognition of Crimea as part of Russia. The newfound respect for Russia’s security needs is evident:
The White House
Proclamation on Recognizing Crimea as Part of the Russian Federation
Issued on: March 25, 2019
The Russian Federation took control of Crimea in 2014 to safeguard its security from external threats. Today, aggressive acts by NATO, including US forces, in the Black Sea and Ukraine continue to make Crimea a potential launching ground for attacks on Russia. Any possible future peace agreement in the region must account for Russia’s need to protect itself from NATO and other regional threats. Based on these unique circumstances, it is therefore appropriate to recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim that, the United States recognizes that Crimea is part of the Russian Federation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand nineteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-third.
DONALD J. TRUMP
Oh wait, that actually didn’t happen. The genuine March 25 proclamation related to something entirely different .
Nevermind .
Let’s get something straight. It is a fantasy to believe that Trump has been freed by Mueller’s goose egg. The Democrats will use his work as a starting point (not as a finish) to keep digging into Trump’s private and business affairs to find something for which they can impeach him. As far as Russia goes, sure there was no direct “collusion,” but on the other hand the report, even before its release, is being cited across the political spectrum as proof that Russia “interfered” in our election to undermine our “democracy” and thus as reason to keep the demonization campaign against Russia going. Pathetically, Trump will continue to defend himself by boasting that “ nobody’s been tougher on Russia ” than he has while futilely calling for better relations (and even mutual decreases in military spending , which will join his nonexistent Mexican wall, his national infrastructure rehab, his Syria pullout, his … ).
In that sense Mueller has changed nothing. We will continue to sputter along like this for the remainder of Trump’s presidency in a continued downward slope. If anyone in Moscow thinks Trump now will be able to move towards normalized relations they are sadly mistaken.
Aside from occasional pipe dreams that supposedly “ declining power ” Russia can be pressed into service as a check against China ( without offering Moscow any positive incentive , of course) what we can count on is continuation of the coordinated campaign to render Russia’s strategic situation untenable: deployment of intermediate-range weapons in Europe to make warning virtually nonexistent (and a strong possibility that START will follow INF into oblivion); strategic bomber probes with prototype nuclear-armed cruise missiles to prepare the aircraft for the possibility of launching the Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) weapon ; NATO maneuvers around Russia’s land and sea borders (but only to deter aggression, of course!); more sanctions; yet more expansion of NATO ( Ukraine and Georgia still on the agenda !); vilification of Russia and, particularly, of President Vladimir Putin; militarization of Ukraine; attacking the Orthodox Church ; the Skripal hoax; more chemical false flags in Syria ; trying to tank South Stream 2; blaming Russia for “undermining democracy” in every western country in addition to the US – all are components of a full-spectrum operation to destroy Russia’s economy, to destabilize its society, to replace its “regime” with one more to their “partners’” liking, and ultimately to dismember Russia.
In the face of this, one is mystified why Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and other Russian statesmen continue to refer politely to their Western “partners” even when it’s painfully clear that they have no Western partners. While these “partners”– who, it should be noted, never that use that term about the Russians – claim they only want to change Moscow’s “behavior,” that isn’t true. There is nothing Russia could do short of surrendering its sovereignty and returning to the 1990s that would even begin mollify Russia’s “partners.” As US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo put it in December 2018, America’s “mission is to reassert our sovereignty [and] reform the liberal international order,” and “we want our friends to help us and to exert their sovereignty as well.” But Russia and other countries that haven’t “embraced Western values of freedom and international cooperation” to Pompeo’s satisfaction aren’t our “friends” and thus have no such sovereign liberty.
In short, these Western “partners” hate Russia not for what it does, but for what it is: an obstacle to absolute global domination by a US-led “liberal international order.” Russia’s deployment of the most powerful weapons imaginable perhaps can limit the military aspect of that agenda, but it cannot reverse it. Quite to the contrary, such actions, like Moscow’s defensive moves after the 2014 regime change in Ukraine or Russia’s 2015 deployment in Syria or current presence in Venezuela, are held up as further “proof” of Russians’“typically, almost genetically driven” aggressiveness, in the words of former CIA Director James Clapper.
Does this mean that western war planners are preparing for a redux of the 1812 Grande Armée or 1941 Operation Barbarossa rolling across Belarus or Ukraine into Russia? No. Rather, western officials, mainly in the US, are confident (aren’t they always?) that under constant moral, economic, financial, and military pressure a tipping point will be reached in Russia’s internal instability and strategic vulnerability (the latter including the knowledge that leadership decapitation without warning is possible), forcing Moscow to fold, either through revolution, or coup, or inflicting a (we would hope, limited) military humiliation on them somewhere.
Notwithstanding their soft rhetoric, the Russian leadership understands this quite well. As Professor Stephen Cohen observes:
‘Moscow closely follows what is said and written in the United States about US-Russian relations. Here too words have consequences. On March 14, Russia’s National Security Council, headed by President Putin, officially raised its perception of American intentions toward Russia from “military dangers” (opasnosti) to direct “military threats” (ugrozy). In short, the Kremlin is preparing for war, however defensive its intention.’
Just over a year ago, in March 2018 , Putin unveiled a new set of deterrent capabilities against “all those who have fueled the arms race over the last 15 years, sought to win unilateral advantages over Russia, [and] introduced unlawful sanctions aimed to contain our country’s development.”(Hint: he was talking about the US and NATO.) “Nobody listened to us,” Putin said then. “Well, listen to us now.”
Of course, they didn’t listen a year ago. And they’re not listening today, either.
Gilbert Doctorow likens the current situation to that in depicted by Leo Tolstoy in War and Peace . Today as then, what happens next will be less due to this or that policymaker making this or that bad decision as much as the existence of a “near universal acceptance of the logic of the coming war” (Must read: “‘ War and Peace’: The Relevance of 1812 as Explained by Tolstoy to Current Global Affairs ,” Antiwar.com ):
‘Transposed to our own day, this issue finds its parallel in the informational war the United States and the West more generally have been waging against Russia. The defamation of Putin, the denigration of Russia all have been swallowed whole by the vast majority of our political classes, who today would view with equanimity, perhaps even with enthusiasm any military conflict with Russia that may arise, whatever the immediate cause.’
Hardheaded observers, notably military men, might reject this notion. Where is mobilization of NATO armies in offensive strength? The Russians know NATO is a joke – they won’t even cough up Trump’s lousy two percent of GDP! General Shoigu isn’t stupid!
Objectively that’s true. But that doesn’t change the fact that western, especially American, policymakers have defined our attitude towards Russia as an existential struggle that can have only one outcome – Russia’s collapse, leading to regime change – either via war or means short of war. All elements of western policy are geared to that one inalterable objective.
That this policy won’t and cannot succeed is never even considered by its authors. It continues because, literally, they cannot think of Russia in any other way. Nikolai Gogol likened the Russia of his day to a speeding troika , wordlessly hurtling towards its fate while “all things on earth fly by and other nations and states gaze askance as they step aside and give her the right of way.”
Today, that reckless plunge describes not Russia but America and our craven satellites. As Israel Shamir concludes :
‘Russians have few ambitions. They do not want to rule the world, or even to dominate their neighbors. They do not want to fight the Empire. They would be content to be left in peace. But if pushed, and now they are being pushed, they will respond. In [the] Russian view, even the most hostile American politicians will desist before the Doomsday collision. And if not, let it be.’
The question that no one in Washington seemingly is asking themselves is not whether war is inevitable but whether the Russian leadership, despite their polite talk, have come to believe (rightly) that positive change in their “partners’” behavior is very unlikely and that therefore war is much more likely than not, according to the “logic” of things described by Doctorow. “Fifty years ago, the streets of Leningrad taught me one rule: if a fight is inevitable you have to strike first,” Putin told journalists at the 2015 Valdai conference. Even if, from the west’s point of view war is not inevitable, what if the Russians have come to believe it is? (Suggested viewing: the films 1612 (2007) and the Taras Bulba (2009) as psychological war preparation of the population comparable to Sergei Eisenstein’s World War II-era Alexander Nevsky (complete with a western bishop with a swastika on his miter ) and the two-part Ivan the Terrible .)
Even more than a year ago , when the writing was already on the wall that Russiagate would turn out to be a whiff as far as nailing Trump goes, it was clear that in one important sense it had exceeded beyond all expectations : achieving permanent enmity between the US and Russia . Now, with the pointless investigation concluded, nothing has improved, nor can there be much expectation that it will. As Doctorow notes:
‘Indeed, no one wants war, neither Washington nor Moscow. However, the step by step dismantling of the channels of communication, of the symbolic projects for cooperation across a wide array of domains, and now dismantling of all the arms limitation agreements that took decades to negotiate and ratify, plus the incoming new weapons systems that leave both sides with under 10 minutes to decide how to respond to alarms of incoming missiles – all of this prepares the way for the Accident to end all Accidents. Such false alarms occurred in the Cold War but some slight measure of mutual trust prompted restraint. That is all gone now and if something goes awry, we are all dead ducks.’
Barring a miracle, this does not end well.

YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK, April 7. /TASS/. Russian Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko has said that working under Russian President Vladimir Putin corresponded to the best years of her life in an interview for the documentary timed to her 70th anniversary, broadcast on the Rossiya-1 channel on Sunday.
“I have been working for Vladimir Vladimirovich [Putin’s] team since day one, and I would like to say from the bottom of my heart that these have been the best years of my life. They have been tough, they have been difficult, but they have been very interesting and eventful,” she said.
“If he [Putin] invites someone to his team, it means that he trusts this person, that is his principle,” the speaker stressed.
Putin has praised Matviyenko’s work ethic in an interview for the same documentary. “Of course, Valentina Ivanovna [Matviyenko] is a very useful and important link in the whole state structure of our today’s work,” the Russian leader stressed. He also noted the top senator’s diplomacy skills, which she uses in her current position.
Matviyenko was elected speaker of the Russian Federation Council in 2011 (reelected in 2014), after serving as the governor of St. Petersburg from 2003 to 2011. She is the first woman to occupy the position of senate speaker.

Russian ambassador meets with UK citizen exposed to nerve agent in Amesbury,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/russian-ambassador-meets-with-uk-citizen-exposed-to-nerve-agent-in-amesbury.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
LONDON, April 7. /TASS/. Charles Rowley, a UK citizen that had been exposed to a nerve agent last summer in Amesbury, has visited the Russian Embassy in the UK on Saturday, where he met with Russian Ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakovenko.
On June 30, 2018, 44-year-old Dawn Sturgess and 45-year-old Charles Rowley were hospitalized in critical condition in the British town of Amesbury. The Metropolitan Police went on to claim that the two had been exposed to Novichok, the same nerve agent that was allegedly used in the Skripal poisoning. After being mysteriously exposed to a nerve agent and falling into a coma, Sturgess died on July 8, while Rowley was discharged from the hospital
Yakovenko has given Rowley and his brother a tour of the embassy, and then they talked for some time behind closed doors. The meeting lasted for about an hour. After the visit, the Russian ambassador told TASS that the UK citizens had made a positive impression on him.
“Very pleasant people. They had many questions towards us, and I was glad to answer them. I presented them with our report [“Salisbury: Unanswered Questions”, timed to the first anniversary of the attack on the Skripals], where we gave our detailed take on what went down in Salisbury,” Yakovenko said.
“I have to say that the majority of questions have been related to the complete lack of information from the side of the British. Namely, they [the Rowley brothers] asked us whether Russia had poisoned the Skripals, and whether Russia is the only country that could have produced Novichok. We provided a full explanation on this matter, and I have proven to him once again that this Novichok can be made in any European laboratory, which is what took place in the Czech Republic and in other countries as well,” the ambassador noted.
According to Yakovenko, the British citizens “talked a lot about their health”. “They are upset, because despite the treatment, Rowley’s condition continues to gradually worsen. He has expressed interest in undergoing treatment in a third country,” the Russian ambassador said.
Yakovenko pointed out that neither Rowley nor his brother has their version of what had taken place. “They have no versions of their own; they only see what is written in the British papers. I asked the Rowleys whether they know what was used during his treatment, and they said that they do not,” the diplomat added.
“My impression was that the purpose of their visit was to try and find out what happened. People just want to know the truth. They have no claims against Russia,” the ambassador stressed.
“They have received no official reports, and probably about 80% of what I said today was a revelation to them. The family of the deceased Sturgess, of course, [also] wants to see the findings of the investigation and is very confused by the fact that they have no information on this case,” he stated.
The ambassador added that he is ready to meet with Sturgess’ family, if they make such a request. The Skripal incident
According to London, former Russian military intelligence (GRU) Colonel Sergei Skripal, who had been convicted in Russia of spying for Great Britain and later swapped for Russian intelligence officers, and his daughter Yulia, suffered the effects of an alleged nerve agent in the British city of Salisbury on March 4, 2018. Claiming that the substance used in the attack had been a Novichok-class nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union, London rushed to accuse Russia of being involved in the incident. Moscow rejected all of the United Kingdom’s accusations, saying that neither the Soviet Union nor Russia ever had any program aimed at developing such a substance.

US map of Palestine just an Israeli illusion: Hamas,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/us-map-of-palestine-just-an-israeli-illusion-hamas.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

The Hamas resistance movement says the purported map of Palestine drawn up by the US President Donald Trump’s administration under the so-called “deal of the century” only represents an “illusion” long chased by Israel.
“The new proposed map of Palestine as part of the Trump’s deal of the century, no matter if true or not, is just an illusion the Israeli occupation has been chasing. The map of historical Palestine is in our hearts and the next generation will inherit it with their genes,” Hamas Political Bureau member Husam Badran said on Saturday.
He also stressed the Palestinian people’s right to return to their hometowns, from which they have been forced since 1948, saying that they would defend their lands despite challenges.
Details of ‘deal’ emerge
The reaction by Badran came after a report offered purported new details of Trump’s “deal.”
Lebanon’s Arabic-language al-Akhbar daily reported on Friday that the so-called “deal of the century” would see Trump pushing for Jordan to absorb one million Palestinian refugees in exchange for 45 billion dollars in financial aid.
Granting citizenship to Palestinians would happen in stages, with the largest number of refugees to be taken in at one time standing at 300,000, the report said, adding that the Gazans living in Jordan would also be included in the process.
Trump would also ask Egypt to grant citizenship to Palestinian refugees and receive 65 billion dollars, according to the report.
He would further propose that Lebanon absorb a portion of its Palestinian refugee population.
The report also said that the US plan on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict proposed forming a tripartite confederation between Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority for specific and limited purposes.
But Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has already rejected the peace plan because it is said to be hugely in favor of the Israeli regime.
‘Jordanian king opposed to confederation’
The report said Jordan’s King Abdullah II had expressed opposition to the establishment of a joint confederation and told Egyptian leaders that he preferred Amman to remain in charge of the holy sites in Jerusalem al-Quds “without interfering in the details between the Israelis and the Palestinians.”
The deal would additionally include giving Jordan’s Naharayim and Tzofar areas — which are currently leased to the Israeli regime — to Tel Aviv. In return, Jordan would receive land from Saudi Arabia.
Earlier this week, the Emirati news website al-Khaleej Online reported that the Trump administration was likely to unveil its “deal” on the 71st anniversary of the Nakba Day (the Day of Catastrophe), in mid-May.
In a leaky White House, very few details of the “deal” have emerged so far. Back in January, Israeli Channel 13 TV reported that the initiative endorsed the Israeli grip over parts of East Jerusalem al-Quds as well as the Holy Basin and stipulated various land swaps and Israel’s annexation of areas with major settlement blocs.
Those few details have nevertheless been rejected in their totality by Palestinians.
New settler units
Separately on Saturday, the so-called Israeli Higher Planning Committee approved the construction of 770 new units in the Beitar Illit settlement, west of the West Bank city of Bethlehem.
The Israeli regime’s traditionally close relationship with the US has grown stronger under Trump. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has used flattery — more than once — and has copied Trump’s demagogic tactics to appeal to a US president obsessed about his self-image .
That has served well to elicit support. Trump has called Jerusalem al-Quds Israel’s “capital,” moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the occupied city, and recognized Israeli “sovereignty” over Syria’s Golan Heights, all of them in contravention of international law.
Emboldened by Trump’s all-out backing, Israel has stepped up its settlement construction activities in the occupied lands in defiance of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334.
At least 600,000 Israelis live in over 230 settlements built illegally since the 1967 occupation of the Palestinian lands.
