I've got brother and sister-in-laws who have large palm-oil plantations in north-eastern Borneo, and if it wasn't for the Chinese investment and management, the whole Malaysian economy would...… totter?

I saw it coming but I didn't think it would last. When Varry Insane Odumbass was elected the first time, I realized that the lethargy and lack of attention was real and that it might be too late. Throughout the eight years of Odumbass, I felt hopeless as he methodically dismantled the US Constitution and weaponized government agencies. I had felt the same way during the Carter Administration but the people awakened and elected Reagan. By midsummer of 2016, I knew Trump would be elected and that once again God had sent us a savior. But Trump has MUCH left to do if our constitutional republic is to be restored. I truly hope you're right in some of your observations and that Trump is slowly putting things right. He needs to pick up speed during his second term. I believe that, like Reagan, he will be elected in a massive landslide taking both the electoral collage and the popular vote. And we will need another equally dedicated patriot and non-politician to follow Trump if we are to sustain what he has done. Reagan's work fell by the wayside when the Republicans put up George H.W. ( globalist) Bush to follow him. H.W. had the charisma to sustain the constitutional republic after Reagan but he chose NWO instead then, by lying to the people about taxes he cut his NWO plans short...thank GOD. That ushered in a new run by the demo-communists who are exceedingly patient and willing to accept miniscule gains as long as they are permanent. And they're willing to accept losses, sometimes big ones, so long as they are temporary. Eventually, they have managed to pack government with their leftist colleagues creating the deep state that Trump is slowly dismantling. Like many, I will not be happy until the arrests are made and the hangings begin. I don't think I've got enough time left to see that."

You will never be able to approach such people with logic as their abusers in the EU have created a fear of change mentality that results in them being conditioned to normalize and accept the abuse that has been happening for decades.
The UK struggle to deliver the Brexit the people voted for illustrates exactly why the UK must leave the EU. It illustrates that the UK is a sovereign nation in name only as a charade to collect money for the throne in Brussels.
Without the money from the UK, the EU collapses and France and Germany are left responsible for the unsustainable EU bag they created. They cannot make up the difference by increasing taxes on the countries left in the EU as France is already showing it has been taxed enough."

Candidates represent parties that offer manifestos of commitments, that are the things it will do if you vote for candidates of that party. Had that manifesto been remotely an honest indication of what it intended, then there would not have been a problem. What is not acceptable is promising one thing, then doing something diametrically opposite, which is what far too many of those candidates (of both main parties) have done.
It is the party hierarchy that selects the leader - or more accurately selects a choice of two from which the membership gets to choose. Britain does not have a presidential system of government - even if, since Blair, they have tried to make it appear so.
This current leader has made speech after speech saying what she will do - all of which were acceptable and in line with that manifesto commitment. The problem is that the words have not been matched by actions. Her words have proved to be blatant lies. That is not something that you can account for when voting for a candidate and the blame for that doesn't lie with the voter, but with the liars.
If you cannot have even a reasonable expectation that the goods offered for consumption match the description than what you have is fraud. Our prime minister is a fraud."
