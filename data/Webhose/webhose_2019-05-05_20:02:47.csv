A realist must acknowledge there is always a political aspect of any investigation of the likes of Clinton, Obama, or Trump. Even a county DA may be politically motivated with reelection in mind as they go about prosecuting local criminals. So, this is all kind of by design, and the pursuit of politics either for ideology or self-interest isn't mutually exclusive with the pursuit of justice, although they're certainly in conflict and the former threatens to destroy the latter. If you're trying to push for a debate about the scandals Arthur mentioned, on Benghazi, I really never paid close attention to that. It sounded like there was some arguably negligent discharge of duties, and a political lie about a video, but nothing criminal, and the degree of hoopla raised by Republicans certainly came off as primarily political. With the birther thing, I'm not aware of any facts that justified the conspiracy theorizing at all. With the emails, quite obviously that was an enormously political matter, but also there's no getting around the fact that ordinary people have been jailed for less negligent handling of classified information."

As is your slipping into weird memerific language whenever this kinda stuff comes up.
Excluding the middle between partisan and political seems very convenient. It's a fuzzy line sometimes, but the recent meh about the Trump admins' e-mail policies shows how purely partisan y'all have gotten.
Whattaboutism is all your side has left; Trump's clearly got shady stuff in whatever is going to be investigated, from finances to taxes to Russia to clearences. So you guys just keep calling it all Fake News or banging on about Irannian payments. Good luck with that."

Care to elaborate on the ""facts"" you supposedly have some understanding of but won't specify? Or the ""weird"" language you reference but won't specify?
The only coherent thing in your reply is that you've offered up a fresh new round of vague whataboutisms - ""Trump admins' email policies"" - never heard of this - and unspecified ""shady stuff"" that Trump has ""clearly got"" going on with Russia, taxes, finances, clearances, and just ""whatever is going to be investigated.""
It's really pathetic. You sound just like the worst conspiracy theorists that used to rant about the Clintons or something. ""He's clearly got some shady stuff going on, I have no idea what it is but I just know it, it will turn up, in the next investigation, or maybe the one after that, or the one after that, but for sure at some point.""
Never mind we just had the mother of all investigations to end all investigations with a special counsel, Trump campaign being wiretapped and spied on all along, illegal pillaging of NSA databases, FBI raiding his attorney's offices, maximum pressure to ""flip"" brought on Trump's associates by prosecutors fishing for process crimes and past unrelated matters with serious jail time being dispensed, etc etc
Unbelievable."

It appears there was no evidence justifying this, and it was mostly political espionage turned into a hoax and cover up and attempted bureaucratic coup -- probably with some sincere but delusional conspiracy theorizing mixed in.
Instead of rebutting this or offering any evidence of why this was justified, you get responses like Arthur's -- ""b-b-but the Republicans did it too."" OK, thank you for impliedly conceding the point."

Springsteen’s Harry Potter Song Will be Released in an Upcoming Movie | the way of improvement leads home,thewayofimprovement.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thewayofimprovement.com/2019/04/05/springsteens-harry-potter-song-will-be-released-in-an-upcoming-movie/,"/ johnfea
I’ll bet you didn’t know that Bruce Springsteen wrote a song for a Harry Potter movie. His song “ I’ll Stand by You Always ” did not make the cut, but it has now found its way into a new Springsteen-inspired movie titled “ Blinded by the Light .”
Here is a taste of Steve Pond’s piece at The Wrap:
Almost 20 years after he wrote the song for a “Harry Potter” movie, Bruce Springsteen has finally found a home for his unreleased ballad “I’ll Stand by You Always.” The song has been added to the end credits of “Blinded by the Light,” an upcoming, Springsteen-heavy New Line/Warner Bros. film from “Bend It Like Beckham” director Gurinder Chadha.
The song did not appear in “Blinded by the Light” when the film screened at Sundance in January, where its $15 million deal with New Line was the festival’s biggest. But it was added before this week’s screenings in Los Angeles and at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, and will now follow the song “Born to Run” during the end credits.
“Blinded by the Light” is based on the memoir “Greetings From Bury Park” by Sarfraz Manzoor, who was born in Pakistan but came to Great Britain as a child. Manzoor wrote about his teenage years in a small British town where his desire to become a writer was inflamed by a passion for Springsteen’s songs.
