United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms - Reason.com,reason.com,Stefan Herpel,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/archives/1990/05/01/united-states-v-one-assortment,"U.S. Coast Guard personnel board a shrimp boat in the Florida Keys on a ""routine"" inspection and find three grams of marijuana stems and seeds in a crew member's wastebasket.

Asset Forfeiture The owner of the boat, who earns his living from shrimping, protests that the marijuana did not belong to him and that he knew nothing about it.
The government seizes the boat.
• Acting without any authorization from a judge, the U.S. Marshal Service takes control of a multimillion-dollar hotel/restaurant complex in Port Salerno, Florida, summarily evicting the management and paying guests, including teachers attending a convention. The papers filed by the government fail to disclose any specific acts of wrongdoing in support of the seizure.
• On suspicion that a Massachusetts resident is a drug dealer, the Drug Enforcement Agency seizes nearly all of his worldly possessions, including his house, clothing, food, and bank accounts. The DEA confiscates his girlfriend's car and jewelry as well.
These are just a few examples of the extraordinary powers given to federal and state governments by drug laws to seize and permanently deprive citizens of their property without bringing criminal charges against them. Few people are aware that the laws granting these powers derive from a spurious medieval doctrine under which an inanimate object can be guilty of wrongdoing. But few who understand both the origin and the operation of these laws can disagree that they are fundamentally incompatible with the principles of a free society.
The so-called civil forfeiture provisions of U.S. drug laws allow the government to seize property when it is used, or intended to be used, to facilitate a drug offense.
Vehicles, boats, and homes are the most common items subject to seizure. The proceeds of illegal drug transactions and property believed to have been purchased with such proceeds are also subject to confiscation. Some time after a seizure (it may be months), the government brings a forfeiture lawsuit to permanently deprive the owner of his or her property.
Civil forfeiture essentially inverts the criminal-law principle that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty and may not be punished until the government overcomes that presumption at a trial. Under federal forfeiture laws, the government is permitted to seize property, usually without a warrant or any prior judicial authorization, on what amounts to a mere suspicion that it has been used or obtained wrongfully. The government need not actually find drugs; forfeiture can occur when the owner merely intended to use the property to facilitate a drug law violation.
When a judicial hearing to validate the seizure finally does take place, after the fact, the burden of proof is shifted from the government to the owner. To avoid forfeiture, he or she must prove that the property is not the proceeds or tool of a drug crime.
Proof that one is innocent of any criminal acts is often not, by itself, a sufficient defense against forfeiture. In a 1987 case, an automobile owned by Missouri resident Ruth Allen was seized after her lover, Vernon Whitlock, Jr., used it to sell cocaine. A judge approved the seizure, even though he concluded that Allen ""was unaware of and uninvolved in"" the illegal use of her car. The forfeiture statute also makes the government's title to seized and forfeited property retroactive to the time of the acts on which the forfeiture is based. Thus, your property may be subject to seizure and forfeiture if you received or purchased it from someone who committed a drug offense.
Given all of these advantages over criminal prosecutions, it is no wonder that forfeiture became, in the words of the Justice Department, ""one of the primary law enforcement tools of the 1980s."" The states, too, have discovered the utility of forfeiture as a law-enforcement tool, adopting statutes similar to federal laws. In December 1988, for example, Detroit police raided a store to make a drug bust but failed to find any drugs. After police dogs sniffed traces of cocaine on three $1.00 bills in the cash register, the police seized the entire contents of the register and a safe, amounting to $4,384.
While forfeiture has come into prominence in the last few years, during the war on drugs, it is actually a relic of the medieval law of ""deodands."" The word deodand comes from the Latin expression Deo Dandum , which means ""to be given to God."" The old English rule was that an inanimate object causing the death of a person was forfeited to the king as a deodand, to be used for the good of the dead man's soul. The rule proceeded from the legal superstition that an inanimate object can itself be guilty of wrongdoing. Thus, if a man fell from a tree and died, the tree was chopped down as a deodand. And according to the great English legal scholar Blackstone, ""If a man falls from a boat or ship in fresh water, and is drowned, it hath been said, that the vessel and cargo are in strictness of law a deodand.""
Because the rule regarding deodands was premised on the guilt of the property itself, property was forfeitable regardless of the guilt or innocence of its owner. As one medieval writer put it, ""Where a man killeth another with the sword of John at Stile, the sword shall be forfeit as deodand, and yet no default is in the owner.""
Consistent with their origins, modern-day forfeiture suits are brought not against individual owners of property but against the property itself. Hence such quaint case titles as United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms , U.S. v. $5,644 , and One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania. Today's version of the law of deodands is even stricter than its feudalistic counterpart. Property may become ""deodand"" when it is ""guilty"" of a transgression far less serious than causing death and when its connection to the offense seems tenuous at best.
To be sure, seized property is not always permanently confiscated. When its chances of prevailing in a forfeiture suit are slim, the federal government may be willing to return property to its owner. But even in these cases the owner receives no compensation for the period during which he or she was deprived of the property. In fact, the owner is usually required to pay storage costs as a condition for the property's return. The shrimp boat described above was returned 41 days following seizure, but only after the owner, among other things, agreed to pay the $100-a-day storage costs incurred during that period.
Until recently, there were virtually no limits on the power of the government to hold property indefinitely. In one case reported in the Detroit News last October, the government held a seized $7,600 motorboat for three and a half months before returning it to the owner upon payment of $4,000 in storage and maintenance charges. In late 1988, in response to growing pressure, Congress provided that the government could not hold conveyances (vehicles, boats, etc.) for more than 60 days without beginning a civil forfeiture lawsuit. If the government misses the deadline, it must return the seized property to its owner.
But 60 days of deprivation is hardly an insignificant encroachment on property rights, and the government still may compel owners whose property is returned to pay heavy storage costs. While the legislation also provides a procedure for obtaining release of the conveyance pending trial, upon the posting of a bond, the U.S. attorney is given virtually unlimited discretion to deny such a release, making that provision almost worthless."

Moscow notes with satisfaction the progress made in normalizing Syria’s relations with other Arab nations, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with Egypt’s Al Ahram newspaper published on Saturday.
""With satisfaction, I note the emerging progress in normalizing the situation surrounding Syria,"" he said. ""This applies both to progress made in restoring relations between Damascus and other Arab capitals and to prospects of Syria’s return to the Arab League.""
He added that Syria remained among the most important Middle Eastern nations and an unalienable part of the Arab world.
""It cannot be artificially excluded from the regional context in order to satisfy myopic, politicized, timeserving views,"" Lavrov said. ""In this regard, we welcome Damascus’ soonest return to the Arab family. This natural and objective process is a clear evidence that the military conflict has ended, that the country has been gradually returning to normal, peaceful life.""
Lavrov noted that a number of Arab diplomatic missions currently operate in the Syrian capital.
""The air traffic between Syria and Tunisia has resumed, the Syrian Arab Republic’s trade and economic ties with Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon are being restored,"" he continued. ""In March, a Syrian parliamentary delegation took part in a regular conference of the Arab Inter-Parliamentary Union in Amman (Jordan)."".

Saturday morning, April 6, 2019, Oklahoma Republicans will assemble in Moore to select a new state chairman and vice chairman and to vote on a platform and changes to the permanent state party rules. Unusually, the rules changes are the most important items on the agenda, as several proposals would further weaken an organization that is already ineffective in promoting a conservative governing agenda at the State Capitol.
I'm a delegate to the 2019 Oklahoma Republican State Convention, but because of a family obligation, I won't be in attendance. Nevertheless, as a few friends have asked for my thoughts about the chairman's election and other issues before the convention, here they are in summary, with details below. In the interest of time, I'm releasing brief recommendations now and will add details as I have time. State Chairman: David McLain State Vice Chairman: No recommendation Rule Change #1: YES. Dec 31 registration requirement for party officers: Rule Change #2: NO. Binds RNC members to Oklahoma primary winner at national convention Rule Change #3: NO. Allows budget committee to long-term contracts with consultants and other vendors. Rule Change #4: NO. Allows state executive committee to hire an executive director. Rule Change #5: NO. Makes state executive committee the supreme governing body of the state party, and changes its membership. Changes authority of budget committee. Rule Change #6: YES. Requires platform committee report to be taken up as first order of business at the state convention. Rule Change #7: Undecided. Blocks defeated platform floor amendments from being considered at subsequent conventions. Rule Change #8: YES. No quorum call allowed at convention. Rule Change #9: YES. Codifies rule that independents not permitted to vote in Republican primaries. Rule Change #10, #11, #12: YES, but amended. Candidates must mark up copy of state platform.
Of the three announced candidates for State Chairman, I would support recent Tulsa County Chairman David McLain. I appreciate his emphasis on shining a light on local, elections and facilitating the efforts of conservative Republicans to win seats on school boards and city councils. In a candidate forum before the Tulsa Area Republican Assembly (click to watch the video on Facebook), McLain was the only candidate to discuss the role of State Chairman as an advocate for the party platform with elected officials. He spoke of going to the State Capitol during last year's tax-increase debate to speak with legislators and remind them of their promises to Republican voters back home. He was able to get a hearing with them, because he had already built relationships with Tulsa County legislators. McLain strikes me as someone who can handle both the practicalities of running a party organization while not forgetting platform and principles, without which there is no motivation to give or get involved in the party.
McLain's opponents are recent Oklahoma County Chairman Daren Ward and Darren Gantz. In the TARA forum, both Ward and Gantz focused solely on electing anyone who happened to have an R after his name on the ballot. Yes, the party leadership needs to win elections, but winning elections should ultimately be in the service of enacting a platform of policies.
Regarding Gantz, I'll repeat what I wrote last year, when he ran for Tulsa County Assessor:
Gantz disappointed me in recent years and lost my trust as he assisted the efforts of the Leftist-founded and Leftist-funded National Popular Vote movement to make inroads among grassroots conservative activists. You may recall that NPV (which would have given Oklahoma's electoral votes to Hillary Clinton, had it passed) passed the State Senate in 2014, but was blocked in the House after an outcry by grassroots activists. Several state senators later recanted their support. Gantz's efforts were aimed at undermining grassroots opposition to this scheme to bypass the Constitution's Electoral College, so that the next time lobbyists tried to push NPV through the Legislature, legislators wouldn't be deterred by constituent backlash. If Oklahoma were to fall to NPV, NPV lobbyists could point to our example to persuade other conservative states to follow suit with this plan to undermine our constitutional method of electing a president. ( Click this link for more about why Gantz's efforts were so dangerous. )
I don't have an opinion on the vice chairman's race. I've received mailers from two candidates.
Several changes to the permanent state party rules have been forwarded from the counties for consideration at by the state convention. Three proposals, numbers 3, 4, and 5, are intended to strip
Rule Change #1, from Harmon County: YES. Require party officers and committee members to have been registered as Republicans by December 31 of the year preceding the election or appointment. Currently, you could theoretically be a registered Democrat one day and Republican State Chairman the next. I would vote YES.
Rule Change #2, from Harmon County: NO. Bind the three Republican National Committee members, who serve as ex officio delegates to the Republican National Convention, to vote for the majority-winner in the Oklahoma Presidential Primary, and increase the threshold for allocation from 15 to 20 percent. I would vote NO.
Rule Change #3, from Harmon County: NO. Authorize the Budget Committee of the state party to enter into long-term contracts with vendors, contracts that a later state chairman would be unable to end. This change would also require hiring of an Executive Director. This provision would allow certain connected political consultants to be locked in to state GOP contracts, and grassroots Republicans would be stuck with them, even if they are incompetent or working against Republican interests. I would vote NO.
Rule Change #4, from Noble County: NO. Authorizes the State Executive Committee to hire an Executive Director to run the party day-to-day. This, in combination with proposed Rule Change #5, would effectively sideline the grassroots-elected State Chairman and the State Committee, which is dominated by grassroots-elected county party officials, in favor of an Executive Committee dominated by elected officials.
Rule Change #5, from Noble County: NO. Changes the composition of the State Executive Committee to be more heavily weighted toward elected officials and makes the State Executive Committee the supreme governing body of the party, ousting the State Committee from that role. Again, this rule change sidelines the chairman, vice chairman, and the county party officials who are elected by the ordinary Republican voters who attend precinct caucuses and county conventions. Currently the executive committee serves as an advisory board to the state chairman, and the chairman and vice chairman nominate 10 at-large members. These at-large positions would be given instead to any Republican members of the congressional delegation -- six at the moment -- with the remainder left to the chairman and vice chairman. The two Republican legislative caucus leaders would be added to the Executive Committee; the highest-ranking Republican in each house is already a member. The rule change also changes the powers of the State Budget Committee. This proposed amendment is a move to diminish the influence of grassroots Republicans on the party organization. Rule Change #6, from Tulsa County: YES. Moves the platform committee report, typically the last item considered at the state convention, to the top of the agenda. This is in response to parliamentary shenanigans by Republican operatives and elected officials who would rather the party didn't have any principles at all. In years past, the platform committee's hard work has been tossed in the trash when a quorum call is made after many delegates start to leave for home at the end of a long day. The hope is that, by making this the first order of business, the platform will receive the attention it deserves.
Rule Change #7, from Oklahoma County: Undecided. Would prohibit a platform amendment from being brought to the floor if it had been considered and defeated at the two immediately previous state conventions. This would not prohibit the resolution from reaching the platform via the platform committee. I was opposed at first blush, but there may be some merit. I would want to hear debate on this issue before deciding.
Rule Change #8, from Tulsa County: YES. This would prohibit the use of a quorum call as a parliamentary maneuver to avoid taking up business on the agenda. Once the convention is convened, the agenda goes forward to completion, even if delegates begin to leave after their agenda items of interest are complete. The motivation is the same as Rule Change #6, to thwart a ploy that has been used in years past to block consideration of the proposed state platform.
Rule Change #9, from Tulsa County: YES. Prohibits independents from voting in Republican primaries, runoffs, or party elections. State law recently changed to allow parties to permit voters registered as independent to vote in their primaries. The Oklahoma Democratic Party now permits independents to vote in Democrat primaries. The Oklahoma Republican Party has not allowed this, and this change would codify that position in state party rules. A party's representative in an election should be chosen by voters who have at least made the very minimal commitment to register as a member of the party.
Rule Changes #10, #11, #12, from Cimarron, Choctaw, and Tulsa Counties: YES, but amended. Three counties passed an identical proposed amendment to the rules: Rule 19 (i) Disclosure of Agreement of Candidates with Our Platform: For a Republican candidate for elective office to receive the endorsement and support of the Oklahoma Republican Party, he must read and mark up a copy of the current Oklahoma Republican Platform, indicating his agreement or disagreement with each plank with explanation as necessary, and make it available for review at the state Party office.
Legislators hate this idea. It would put them on the record on every issue in the platform, giving campaign fodder to Democratic opponents. Grassroots activists love this idea, because helps them figure out which primary candidates are worthy of their support. In this time when it's politically advantageous to run as a Republican, we need a tool to discern which candidates are committed to the party's philosophy and which are merely opportunists.
In order for this proposal to help weed out the RINOs without hurting good Republican candidates, the platform needs to be much more concise. I would propose amending the proposal with the requirement that the platform be no more than eight letter-size pages, in 10-point font with one-inch margins. This year's proposed platform is 35 pages long! Without a length constraint, the platform committee is susceptible to logrolling: I won't object to a plank on your obscure pet issue if you don't object to mine. The remedy is a page limitation, with page budgets for each section. This gives subcommittees and the committee as a whole an incentive to weed out obscurities and focus on those planks which speak to broad principles and which enjoy broad agreement. When I served as Tulsa County platform chairman in 2003, we used page limitations to reduce a 40+ page document (if I recall correctly) to 8 pages, and everyone in the committee felt that their issues had been heard and were pleased with the outcome. So yes, let's require candidates who want party support to tell us where they stand, but let's give them a more carefully crafted and concise platform to respond to. Categories"

Can our government do anything to hold NSO accountable? Theoretically they could but is lower in the priority scale than lots of other issues so realistically there isn’t anything that they can do at this point.
