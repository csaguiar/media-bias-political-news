Those same leftists tried to make a big ol’ deal about all of the allegations against Trump and Roy Molester Moore. Or tried to claim that Trump’s Hollywood Access admission was anything more than “locker room talk.” Or that Trump was lying when he paid off a porn star, which he clearly didn’t. Or that the fact that Trump paid off multiple adult entertainers to cover up multiple affairs somehow makes him less of a Christian family man. Well, us MAGA Patriots know that this is all just fake news part of a Deep State witch-hunt hoax. MAGA!!"
