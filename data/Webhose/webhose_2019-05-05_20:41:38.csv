Why the NCAA Should Pay Student-Athletes—And Let Them Unionize,inthesetimes.com,Brian Wakamo,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/21836/ncaa_student_athletes_injury_compensation_march_madness/,"Friday, Apr 5, 2019, 8:13 pm Why the NCAA Should Pay Student-Athletes—And Let Them Unionize
message captcha Zion Williamson of the Duke Blue Devils dunks the ball against the Virginia Tech Hokies during the 2019 NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament on March 29. (Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images)
When Zion Williamson’s foot broke through the sole of his Nike shoe on Feb. 20, the sporting world stood still.
The consensus number-one player in college basketball was playing in the biggest game of the season—North Carolina versus Duke—and suffered his startling injury in the opening minute. Williamson’s sprained knee cost Nike $1.1 billion in stock market valuation the next day.​
The injury came on the doorstep of March Madness, the NCAA’s most profitable event of the year—to the tune of $900 million in revenue.
Despite the billions riding on his performance, the NCAA insists that athletes like Williamson are “amateurs”—student-athletes there only for the love of the game. It forbids them to make money off their performance even as they support an industry worth billions. Duke alone makes $31 million off its basketball program.
Williamson has been a force of nature this season, captivating audiences and NBA scouts alike. Enticing those NBA scouts is the only way this 18-year-old can build his own future career—and any sort of injury imperils that future.
High-level “student-athletes,” after all, don’t get to spend much time being students.
They’re supposed to spend only 20 hours a week on sports-related activities. In reality, they spend around 40 hours on practice alone. Schoolwork falls by the wayside, so many schools have outside tutors do the players’ schoolwork and create classes-in-name-only where the only requirement is to turn in a paper.
A few years ago, some former athletes at the University of North Carolina sued the school and the NCAA , claiming they’d been denied a meaningful education. It’s hard to argue with that.
The athletes, in exchange for scholarships, give these schools their lives and put their health at risk. Concussions of football players have sparked lawsuits , and an injury like Williamson’s could cost a player millions in the professional leagues. If they can’t go pro—and their education didn’t do them any favors—what option do they have?
That risk is where the travesty lies. These thousands of athletes who play in the NCAA are often not allowed to enjoy the benefits of the schools they attend (and enrich). If they’re not able to make use of their education, they should be paid for the work they put in.
When college sports revenues are as high as they’ve ever been, the failure to pay the athletes is absurd—but not surprising.
Inequality of all kinds is on the rise, and the gap between the top and bottom of the pay scale is the highest since the Gilded Age of the early 1900s. The NCAA not allowing athletes to be paid—or even sign autographs for money!—is an extension of an economy where unions are busted and people have to work three jobs to make ends meet.
It needs to change. College basketball players are on average worth $212,080 to their program, much more than the cost of their scholarships.
Schools should pay these athletes a share of the revenue their sport brings in. And the NCAA needs, at the very least, to allow for these people to make money selling autographs or appearing at sports camps.
Just as importantly, athletes should be allowed to unionize their teams and fight for their own rights.
Billions of dollars are going to be spent on betting on March Madness games. CBS and Turner paid around $19 billion for the television rights to the tournament. And over $1 billion in advertising is spent on the tournament.
This event is all about the money. We should spread it around to the people who make it worthwhile.

San Antonio Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich has a short fuse—63 seconds long, to be exact. The coach may have set a new NBA record Wednesday night when he became furious over a non-foul call at the start of a game against the Denver Nuggets and was slapped with a technical by official Mark Ayotte. Popovich couldn’t let it go was handed another from official David Guthrie. San Antonio was trailing 5-0 as he made his way back to the locker room. Assistant Coach Ettore Messina took over as the Spurs went on to lose 113-85. The super-quick ejection could be a league record—the last time a coach was ordered off in the first two minutes of a game was Washington’s Flip Saunders, who, in 2012, was thrown out 106 seconds into a game. Popovich also was ejected Sunday in a loss to the Sacramento Kings. San Antonio’s Popovich Ejected Just 63 Seconds Into Game Cheat Sheet ®"

Obama Admin Warns Border Crisis Boiling Over,whatdidyousay.org,Jerry Broussard,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://whatdidyousay.org/2019/04/05/obama-admin-warns-border-crisis-boiling-over/,"URL of the original posting site: https://theblacksphere.net/2019/04/obama-admin-warns-border-crisis-boiling-over/ Once upon a time, President Obama warned the United States cannot tolerate illegal immigration. Then, President Trump worked to turn his lip-service into action.
And we all know what happened next. Democrats suddenly started pretending the border crisis doesn’t exist.
In fact, not too long ago, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer stood arm in arm, acting as though they’ve never even considered a border crisis. Considering the massive proof that most Democrats previously supported tightening border security, only one logical explanation remained. Apparently America is nothing without our illegals.
Thus, Pelosi let the cat out of the bag as to why she and other Democrats oppose President Trump’s wall. She wants illegals to vote.
Pelosi spoke at a news conference on voting rights with Rep. Lloyd Dogget (D-TX) in Austin, Texas. According to the House Speaker, “ newcomers ” should “be fully part of our system” after arriving in the United States. Newcomers are in fact Pelosi’s euphemism for illegals. “So, when we talk about newcomers, we have to recognize the constant reinvigoration of America that they are, that we all have been – our families,” Pelosi said . “And that, unless you’re blessed to be Native American – which is a blessing in itself that we respect – but that constant reinvigoration of hope, determination, optimism, courage, to make the future better for the next generation. “Those are American traits. And these newcomers make America more American. “[Further] we want them, when they come here, to be fully part of our system. “And that means not suppressing the vote of our newcomers to America.” Sadly, neither Americans or our LEGAL newcomers can accomplish this “re-invigoration” of the country. It takes illegals to do this.
But those votes link to clear and present danger, whether Pelosi admits it or not. Democrats can deny the border crisis as much as they want to, but the numbers don’t lie. More than a million illegal immigrants know to be in the US absolutely refuse to comply with deportation rules. How’s that for “law-abiding citizens?” Additionally, some estimates forecast more than a million migrants will be apprehended this year alone trying to cross illegally.
As Fox News reports: Obama-era Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan sounded the alarm Thursday on the crisis at the southern border , testifying before Congress that the crisis is “at a magnitude never seen in modern times” and urging lawmakers to act to stop what he described as a virtual “open border policy.” “We’re experiencing a crisis at the southern border at a magnitude never seen in modern times, it’s unprecedented,” Morgan, who served as the head of U.S. Border Patrol during the Obama administration, told the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Morgan made the remarks after Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said that more than 76,000 migrants were detained in February — the highest number of apprehensions in 12 years — and were on pace for more than 100,000 apprehensions in March. The surge in numbers has led President Trump, who declared a national emergency on the border in February, to threaten to close the southern border if Mexico did not stem the numbers flowing north, and if Congress did not act. “If we don’t make a deal with Congress…or if Mexico doesn’t do what they should be doing…then we’re going to close the border, that’s going to be it, or we’re going to close large sections of the border, maybe not all of it,” he said in the Oval Office Wednesday. Downward Spiral
Of course, we know the border crisis is escalating a neck-breaking speed. Under Obama, the crisis was difficult to manage. But now, the President fights this battle without the support of Congress. Further, many agents are diverted from security to humanitarian efforts.
Fox continues: “In 2016, as chief, I estimated 15 percent of agents’ resources were diverted from the front lines to support humanitarian activities. I saw that as a crisis and so did everyone else, ” he said. “Now Border Patrol is diverting 40 percent of personnel away from front lines to humanitarian-related functions, meanwhile cartels are exploiting the resultant resource gaps.” Like Trump, who has blamed U.S. immigration laws in part for the crisis, Morgan said that “loopholes in our asylum laws and nonsensical judicial precedent has driven what has devolved into essentially an open border policy for a certain demographic.” He added that families coming to the border know that if they step foot on U.S. soil they can say they have “ credible fear ” of returning home and they’ll be allowed into the U.S. He also warned that an unsecured border is leading to increased flows of drugs into the U.S. and called the claim that most drugs come through ports of entry “simply false.” “We have no idea, no idea what’s coming through our southwest border,” he said.
It’s actually very simple, we have two choices here. We can continue listening to an ideology fueled by personal politics and bitterness over a lost election. Or, we can study the facts, evaluate the figures, and protect our country."
America Needs To Hear Judge’s Words in Pro-High Capacity Magazine Decision,whatdidyousay.org,Jerry Broussard,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://whatdidyousay.org/2019/04/05/america-needs-to-hear-judges-words-in-pro-high-capacity-magazine-decision/,"Reported By Ben Marquis | Published April 4, 2019 at 3:51pm URL of the original posting site: https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/america-needs-hear-judges-words-pro-high-capacity-magazine-decision/ A federal district judge in California recently knocked down that state’s ban on firearm magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition as being an unconstitutional infringement of the Second Amendment. The liberal media hasn’t really said too much about the ramifications of this ruling, and for good reason, as it undermines a major argument put forward by the anti-gun crowd in support of their confiscatory gun control schemes.
NBC News reported U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez struck down the ban on possession of “large capacity magazines” that hold more than 10 rounds, in large part due to the commonality of such ammunition feeding devices. Benitez also slammed the lawmakers who think they know what citizens need to defend themselves and their families or protect their homes and property from common armed criminals.
The judge’s 86-page ruling began by declaring “Individual liberty and freedom are not outmoded concepts,” and compared three stories of home invasions in which a woman used a firearm to defend against her assailants. In two of those cases, the victim ran out of ammunition prior to the end of the criminal assault against them, while in the third case, a woman dressed in only pajamas with a large capacity magazine managed to fend off three attackers because she had the extra ammunition in the large capacity magazine. Benitez wrote that the woman “held a phone in one hand and took up her pistol in the other and began shooting. She fired numerous shots. She had no place to carry an extra magazine and no way to reload because her left hand held the phone with which she was still trying to call 911. After the shooting was over and two of the armed suspects got away and one lay dead, she did get through to the police.”
California first instituted a ban on so-called large capacity magazines in 2000 but allowed those who already possessed such magazines to keep them. However, the law was changed in 2016 to no longer grandfather those previously possessed magazines. Benitez had issued an injunction in 2017 to block the implementation of that law, which would have required all such magazines be turned in or else risk a felony charge for unlawful possession. The reasoning behind the added confiscation and penalties for possession was to reduce death counts in mass shootings. However, Benitez noted that while incredibly tragic, mass shootings were also “extremely rare,” and the law-abiding citizenry shouldn’t be infringed upon with a “solution” to a relatively small problem.
Citing the prevalence of common crimes versus mass shootings — and the fact that it wholly depends on each individual incident to know how many rounds will be needed to defend oneself — the judge decried the limit of 10 rounds to be a significant burden on the Second Amendment-protected right of all law-abiding Americans to possess “ arms ” necessary for self-defense. The ruling cited the Supreme Court’s monumental District of Columbia v. Heller decision in 2008, as well as other cases similarly couched on that precedent, which guaranteed the right of Americans to possess “common” arms. Benitez ruled that standard magazines that hold more than 10 rounds fell into the category of being arms in common use. He also gave a nod to the “ militia ” clause in the Second Amendment later in the ruling by noting that, in the unlikely but still possible event a citizen militia would need to defend the country in the future, they would likely have to do so with firearms and magazines holding more than 10 rounds. “Constitutional rights stand through time holding fast through the ebb and flow of current controversy. Needing a solution to a current law enforcement difficulty cannot be justification for ignoring the Bill of Rights as bad policy. Bad political ideas cannot be stopped by criminalizing bad political speech,” Benitez wrote. “Crime waves cannot be broken with warrantless searches and unreasonable seizures. Neither can the government response to a few mad men with guns and ammunition be a law that turns millions of responsible, law-abiding people trying to protect themselves into criminals. Yet, this is the effect of California’s large-capacity magazine law,” he added.
The judge also took on the leftist trope that firearms holding more than 10 rounds were “too lethal” for the average citizen to possess. After noting that all firearms of any capacity are “ dangerous ” and “ lethal ,” he followed the faulty logic to conclude that, if the 10-round limit were allowed to stand, it could eventually be reduced by the state to as few as one allowable round — a ridiculous notion that would completely undermine the entire premise of armed self-defense.
Judge Benitez concluded that California’s ban on magazines that hold more than 10 rounds could not survive any level of legal scrutiny, nor was it historically acceptable prohibition, and thus was unconstitutional as it placed an unfair and severe burden on law-abiding citizens.
This judge is exactly right. Nobody knows how many rounds will be necessary to defend against an unknown number of assailants, and arbitrary limits imposed by the state — with criminal liability for non-compliance — only serve to burden law-abiding citizens while having no effect on criminals who are already violating existing laws.

ICE Arrests Hundreds in Biggest Workplace Immigration Raid in a Decade,whatdidyousay.org,Jerry Broussard,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://whatdidyousay.org/2019/04/05/ice-arrests-hundreds-in-biggest-workplace-immigration-raid-in-a-decade/,"Reported By Jack Davis | Published April 5, 2019 at 7:54am URL of the original posting site: https://www.westernjournal.com/ice-arrests-hundreds-biggest-workplace-immigration-raid-decade/
Immigration and Customs Enforcement sent a strong message to employers who hire illegal immigrants with a Wednesday raid on a Texas company that netted more than 280 people working in the U.S. illegally. The raid on the Allen, Texas, location of CVE Electronics, a New Jersey-based company, was described as the biggest workplace immigration raid in a decade, NBC reported. Four related staffing businesses were also raided. Allen is located 25 miles from Dallas.
“Businesses that knowingly hire illegal aliens create an unfair advantage over their competing businesses. They take jobs away from U.S. citizens and legal residents, and they create an atmosphere poised for exploiting their illegal workforce,” Katrina Berger, Homeland Security Investigations Dallas special agent in charge, said according to USA Today .
“We need integrity in our immigration systems. Illegal workers, these companies need to go about it properly. They need to be using a legal workforce. It’s required by law,” Berger said, KTVT reported.
The investigation began in January after ICE received tips that illegal immigrants had been hired by the company. An audit of CVE’s I-9 forms was then performed, NPR reported. Federal hiring laws require that new hires fill out I-9 forms to verify citizenship. The laws perform “necessary and common sense functions,” Berger said.
“They ensure U.S. citizens and legal U.S. residents are hired for jobs in the U.S. They also ensure that illegal workers are not preyed upon or paid less than the going wage or otherwise coerced or cheated or subjected to unsafe working conditions without any means of complaint,” she said.
However, those arrested and their families were displeased at the loss of their jobs.
“It’s not fair. It’s really sad and it makes a lot of people really angry and frustrated,” Anel Perez, daughter of a detained worker, said.
“The hardest thing was when the bus started taking off,” Wendy Armas of Gautemala, who was arrested and released to appear in court next month, said. She added that she had worked for five years at CVE.
“There was a long moment of silence, people crying, people saying, ‘I’m going to leave this country and go back to my own.’”
Some of those arrested could be eligible for a humanitarian release after being interviewed, Berger said. Others will be sent back to the home countries.
“Unauthorized workers often use stolen IDs of legal U.S. workers, which can profoundly damage for years the identity-theft victim’s credit, medical records and other aspects of their everyday life,” ICE said in a statement .
“The investigation is ongoing, but we can disclose that this is the largest ICE work site operation at one site in the last 10 years,” said Berger.
Raids on employers who hired illegal immigrants have stepped up under the Trump administration.
“Not only are we going to prosecute the employers that hire illegal workers, we’re going to detain and remove the illegal alien workers,” former acting ICE Director Thomas Homan said in 2017, announcing the change in policy.
“When we find you at a work site, we’re no longer going to turn our heads. We’ll go after the employer who knowingly hires an illegal alien … but we’re always going to arrest a person who is here illegally. That is our job,” he said, according to CNN .
In August, immigration officials said they thought a raid at a Texas company was its largest in a decade when it arrested 160 workers at Load Trail, a manufacturing company located in Paris Texas, according to the Dallas Morning News . Last June, 114 workers were arrested at two locations of Corso’s Flower and Garden Center, an Ohio gardening center, according to The Washington Post .
Before that, ICE had raided Southern Provision, a meatpacking company located in in Bean Station Tennessee, in April 2018 and arrested 97 workers, according to The Washington Post .

The road from critique to power is long and difficult, but the effervescence of the left-wing political imagination indicates how seriously socialists take this challenge. Nick Serpe &squarf; Spring 2019 Major media outlets have been covering the curious (at least to them) return of socialism for a few years now. But ever since Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became an overnight media sensation, the socialist beat has boomed. In February, the radical centrists at The Economist boarded the bandwagon with a cover story on “millennial socialism.” More sophisticated than the typical road-to-Venezuela brief, the magazine treats the resurgence of socialist politics as a fashion of the “hip, young and socially conscious” but also gives serious attention to policy proposals like the Green New Deal and ongoing disagreements within the left. In other words, they take us seriously, but not too seriously. A leftward drift in transatlantic public opinion does not a revolution make. But while the “left today sees the third way as a dead end,” The Economist ’s counter-offers are of 1990s vintage: economic growth instead of redistribution, cap-and-trade instead of a massive reorientation of the economy to fight climate change, labor market liberalization instead of union democracy, fiscal restraint instead of ambitious public spending. These mantras betray the intellectual torpor of an establishment that has won so often it can barely imagine ever losing. The Economist claims that the left is “too pessimistic about the modern world” while also admitting, with somewhat baffling generosity, that socialists “want to expand and fulfil freedoms yet to be obtained” and democratize our societies. Their only response is that these ideas are unrealistic. The road from critique to power is long and difficult, but the effervescence of the left-wing political imagination indicates how seriously socialists take this challenge. We shouldn’t confuse attention from the mainstream press with victory, but articles like these remind us that the status quo’s staying power has less to do with inspiring alternatives than inertia. We’re building an opposing force.

Advertisement Maybe the report could be considered 'nonsense' by those who haven't explored the concept of 'supersoldiers', alters etc. But it seems pretty likely if anything about those programs that I've come across is true. America would also have it's own supersoldiers that could do that and defend against attacks. Thoughts?

Quote: : According to a report in the official magazine of its Defense Ministry, Russian “supersoldiers” are able to use “parapsychology” techniques to crash enemy computers, access the minds of foreign soldiers, and read documents inside locked safes — abilities they gained, according to the article, from telepathic dolphins they can now communicate with.
The report is almost certainly nonsense. But it does raise questions about the ambitions — and perhaps dysfunctions — of Russia’s military. https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-...ays-2019-4"

Source:
University of Edinburgh
Summary:
A 150 million-year-old fossil has been identified as a previously unseen species of ancient crocodile that developed a tail fin and paddle-like limbs for life in the sea.
A newly identified species of 150 million-year-old marine crocodile has given insights into how a group of ancient animals evolved.
The ancestor of today's crocodiles belonged to a group of animals that developed a tail fin and paddle-like limbs for life in the sea, resembling dolphins more than crocodiles.
These slender animals, which fed on fast-moving prey such as squid and small fish, lived during the Jurassic era in shallow seas and lagoons in what is now Germany. Related species have previously been found in Mexico and Argentina.
An international team of scientists, including researchers from Germany and the University of Edinburgh, identified the new species from a remarkably well-preserved skeleton.
The fossil was discovered in 2014 in a quarry near the town of Bamberg in Bavaria, Germany by a team from the Naturkunde-Museum Bamberg, where it is now housed. The species, Cricosaurus bambergensis, takes its name from the town

Huh tv media always seems to,lunaticoutpost.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-120448.html,"Huh tv media always seems to Advertisement Or in general , it's like walking up to a guy who asks you to choose then based on that something or something and once u choose to play or think that way. Maybe 1000 of years of this and if everyone thinks that way a predicable thing. So I don't want to have to make choices when the information is incomplete and looking around seems weird. Not really political but Trump is basically saying things to make fun of his own image and he knows it I think. Unreasonable hot tempered mean and it's tied to America's heartland? Or middle America. They dump on the middle class so hard and it's interesting , for instance older generations don't seem to take part in level games or hidden groups of hidden layers of well maybe but it's like learning something people who know more can dump on you and they do it seems . But what if it's just a way of thinking and caution and observing and poking is needed. I want to know about mysteries but it's always a translation of a older language with a root word that means this to some and this to others but really it's this so they are thinking this and that can be done but don't worry about it .sort of thing. Natural man is made to be mocked and anihalated by ex cons with cell phones taken by the thinking that seems to , well, at the risk of possibly being a jerk to helpful people I say this as an observer with no real motivbut to be close to people and happy. Maybe we manifest nice things from this place and it's erroded so we are controllable. Yet it's control in a way thru fear but with people embolden to do horrible things but only in structured sociatal way. Still nasty things. What's the defense to that. Sometimes it's all just supposed to mean this with a message of that and it's sneaky and just why why is it like that. Like plotting people using people by just using their weakness for their ends or supercharging their already angry disposition to some collection of people not hurting anyone while in secret they slaughter people and that's alright. I'm sure networking and who does what has taken over zest to do something not for money and actual talent. Like seeing a money route and doing things for that, whereas in the past kids were more geared to interest now it's money driven. Back when the strong people or people who just didn't like seeing things out of balance or cruel would stick their necks out , and through endless media manipulation with the sense of dollars driving mostly all manuevers it's a magic trick of control. Like hanging out in the sand say 100 people and over time it goes from fair with respected people thinking how things are fair. Then over time it's a group that takes from regular people then another group and another and the open and peaceful where u have to share ideas and see people is changed for hiding and injuring because it's now just people of their group they are around and a controlled message So now it's a hidden. Government with all psyop and if you know people who are apools ur fine and can be a community watcher again hiding and benefiting but it's fine they are this or that. How are places taken over and that's prob the skill sharpened the most over time. Hidden groups hidden agreements and at some point being ignorant might be just as correct as knowing some of something from someone's view. Most likely I'm wrong , and that's fine but being simple trying to have some Golden rule and failing a lot but putting people on level ground or higher would be helpful to all I'm guessing. Butthen again I'm mostly always wrong so maybe thinking right wrong in terms of feedback from life in terms of money people status . All easily manipulated . Like some old guy with generations of trends hating his for various reasons but overall because they share a view and they tend to utilize emotional tactics to demonize the wrong guys where those capeable of feeling are played and those who are rationally stealing and adding suffering to people claiming abunch of casinos is personal choice. Yeah I see that but the state is sort of benefitting from the problems a lot of times of others discarding them and filtering the money to use for political gain. So if it was simple with some complex stuff for fun in the open or at least not always hidden. You can mess someone up just telling people one thing but a few and those people instincivly know something's up and are placed unfairly into a mental damage zone of sorts placed guessing and feeling isolated . And groups do this all the time, a young kid walked by and called me suss with some flare and I guess I am, he might be right , maybe everyone is enlightened and I'm not. Still, there was a time when people didn't need to act right to be judged this way so that or this . Like growing up middle class having a nice skill and using it to then steal from the middle and lower class. Is the goal always just to gain funds and utilize the methods of using money to make money. It can make sense and is prob far more complex than I know but again it could also be simple and achieve better goals. For instance, drastic different people why isn't their more places where they just do their thing and if they weren't hunted might help society and not have people who hate them causing the first wrong that goes on for ever it seems. So yeah I want a coded bumper sticker or to pass messages to people but screwing people over and hiding takes power from regular people. So yeah Trump's angry dumb guy and is America. Yeah, there are a few people in every place where u trust or u just know and respect they don't post or talk that much but are fair and expect to not be screwed over and when they are they just say f it, as retaliating might be a setup or because it's not worth it and they get used to it and over time only people screwing over epople run the business just a question of the better unethical tacrics. So learn better unethical tactics or just be fair and direct and I guess nice but it's not needed but if you want to sort of thing. Like a person who is nice but they really are given up on corny emotion and trust and want to learn college skills to bring back to their country and in the meantime also dump on kind and nice people as it makes them sick they want cold logic sweatshop that seems like the overall problem LoP Guest"
NXIVM latest developments,lunaticoutpost.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-120447.html,"Post: #2 RE: NXIVM latest developments
Prosecutors overseeing the Nxivm case admitted in court Thursday that they accidentally replicated child porn — a federal crime — while turning over mountains of evidence to defense attorneys.
The bombshell mistake was revealed after a lawyer for accused sex cult leader Keith Raniere told Brooklyn federal court judge Nicholas Garaufis there’d been a recent “technical issue” as prosecutors turned over discovery in the case — where Raniere is accused of manufacturing kiddie porn.
“There was an issue regarding one of the discovery devices,” defense attorney Marc Agnifilo told the court, before offering the floor to Assistant US Attorney Moira Penza.
“We did not know there were child pornography images on the device,” Penza said of the unspecified device, which was turned over to defense sometime last week. “We reproduced the device.”

Nurse adopts girl who had no visitors during hospital stay,lunaticoutpost.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-120446.html,"Post: #1 Nurse adopts girl who had no visitors during hospital stay
Advertisement A Massachusetts director of nursing who at the end of each workday took to visiting an infant who had landed in her hospital is now the girl’s mother after she had volunteered to foster her when the state gained custody of her in October 2016. Liz Smith’s daughter, Gisele, was born at 29 weeks gestation in July 2016, and was diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome due to her birth mother’s drug use during pregnancy.
According to Franciscan Children’s blog, Gisele, who was born weighing just under 2 pounds, spent three months in the NICU on ventilator support before she was transferred to Franciscan Children’s, and had developed an oral aversion. The infant had allegedly no visitors during her time at Franciscan Children’s, except for 45-year-old Smith, who herself had recently learned that she was not a good candidate for IVF.
With support from family and friends, Smith decided to foster Gisele, who was then 9 months old, with the hope of helping her thrive outside the hospital walls. At first, Gisele’s birth parents had supervised weekly visitations, but according to the blog those soon became infrequent and the goal went from reunification to adoption.

Advertisement President Donald Trump responded to former first lady Barbara Bush's negative opinion of him, detailed in a newly released book about the late matriarch of the Bush family, saying her criticism was because of what he'd done to her sons.
""I have heard that she was nasty to me, but she should be. Look what I did to her sons,"" Trump told the Washington Times in an exclusive interview published Thursday.
Bush, wife to one president and mother of another president, died in late April at age 92 and her husband, former President George H.W. Bush, died just months later in November. Trump was not invited to attend either funeral.
In 2016, her second son, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, mounted a run for the Republican presidential nomination and was nicknamed him ""low energy Jeb"" by Trump. Trump also frequently criticized her eldest son on the campaign trail, former President George W. Bush.

Samantha Power reflects on what we’ve learned and forgotten 25 years after the Rwandan genocide,www.hks.harvard.edu,HLS News Staff,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty-research/policy-topics/human-rights-justice/samantha-power-reflects-what-weve-learned-and,"Ralph Ranalli April 04, 2019 On April 7, 1994, soldiers, police, and militia members loyal to Rwanda’s Hutu-led government began systematically killing Tutsi and moderate Hutu political and military officials. Over the ensuing 100 days, as the United States and other world powers declined to intervene, more than 800,000 members of the Tutsi minority and moderate Hutu were murdered, some by soldiers but many by their Hutu neighbors wielding machetes and farm tools. Samantha Power, a former journalist and war correspondent who would later serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 2013 to 2017, chronicled the global community’s failure to respond in her 2003 Pulitzer Prize-winning book “‘A Problem from Hell’: America and the Age of Genocide.” Power, the former director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy and now Anna Lindh Professor of the Practice of Global Leadership and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and professor of practice at Harvard Law School, reflects on the tragedy in Rwanda and the lessons learned—and not learned—since. Q: It’s been 25 years since the Rwandan Genocide. What were the lessons of that tragic event, and has the world taken them to heart? In Rwanda the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide staged a series of mini-massacres in advance of carrying out the organized murder of more than 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu. They were testing the so-called international community to see what they might be able to get away with. When they saw that these crimes were largely ignored, they felt a growing sense of impunity and believed, accurately, that they would be able to go forward with their organized killing without much international interference. The world is better today at recognizing the risks of early atrocities, and senior U.N. officials and others are quicker to raise the alarm than they were in the past. U.N. peacekeepers, while still not nearly as capable across the board as they should be, have in various missions been more aggressive in protecting civilians who come under threat. The U.N. Security Council equips peacekeepers with mandates and rules of engagement that allow blue helmets to be more proactive in reacting. But unfortunately today peacekeepers, mediators, and others are over-extended, because of the vast number of conflicts and daunting number of places where atrocities have occurred or may occur. Q: Do you see conditions that might contribute to a similar event happening again today? And what steps need to be taken to ensure that doesn’t happen? Every case of genocide and mass atrocity is of course different than every other. But in the last two years, we have seen the Myanmar military’s systematic campaign of destruction against the Rohingya, using murder, rape, and forced expulsion to rid the country of a Muslim minority that had long been persecuted. The countries of the world responded limply. While U.N. officials issued countless sirens, and the horror of what was being perpetrated was well-documented, China blocked meaningful action on the Security Council. The United States issued occasional condemnations but carried out no sustained, high-level diplomacy. And Europe, beset by its own divisions on this and much else, was ineffectual as well. The humanitarian response has been generous, but the Myanmar government’s calculus will not be altered and Rohingya will not be able to safely return to their homes without far more collective, sustained diplomatic and economic pressure. Q: How do you think the current U.S. government, and the global community, would respond if something similar happen today? The “next Rwanda” will not look like what happened in Rwanda. So it is essential not to wait until we see crimes of that magnitude to mobilize international action. Right now, the only country in the world invested in expanding its diplomatic corps commensurate to the scale of the world’s challenges is China. However, China is skeptical of “outside interference” in trying to prevent human rights crises and mass atrocities. The U.S. government, which in the Obama administration built up a range of new tools to try to prevent atrocities before they spiraled out of control, is generally not using those tools, except when Congress requires it. Senior U.S. diplomacy is nowhere to be found in trying to mobilize the international community to combat atrocities in places like South Sudan, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and beyond. This can be remedied, but after mass resignations and sustained disempowerment of career U.S. diplomats, it will require the wholesale renovation of the diplomatic corps and a president’s reassertion of the importance of taking appropriate steps to try to prevent and punish mass atrocities. — Portrait by Raychel Casey More from HKS"
Politicos Embrace Far-Left Policies at Their Peril,nationalcenter.org,David Almasi,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://nationalcenter.org/ncppr/2019/04/05/politicos-embrace-far-left-policies-at-their-peril/,"Posted at 21:25h in Blog , Featured , Project 21 by David Almasi
Liberal politicians looking to set themselves apart from their colleagues are pushing the envelope with identity politics. The reason, said Project 21 Co-Chairman Horace Cooper during a recent panel discussion on the Fox News Channel, is because “division works.”
But such positions could end up being a double-edged sword.
The embrace of identity politics has become so brazen that Stacey Abrams – a failed former gubernatorial candidate in Georgia now considering a run for U.S. Senate or the presidency – proclaimed at the Reverend Al Sharpton’s recent National Action Network conference: “I believe in identity politics.”
Hardly unambiguous. And surprisingly not at all in the extreme for the event. Yet such a political strategy could be short-sighted for those seeking to appeal to the entire electorate. As Horace explained on a recent edition of The Ingraham Angle:
If you rile up people – if you get them angry instead of looking at the gains that have been achieved, [liberals] can benefit…
The problem is many black Americans, white Americans and brown Americans are looking around and saying, “What am I getting with all this division?”
One particular topic in the identity politics grab bag that appears to be important for earning Sharpton’s favor is support for reparations to be paid to black Americans for enslavement that happened generations ago. While it is something many liberal politicians allegedly endorse, Horace pointed out the impossibility of being able to justify such a thing in this day and age in addition to determining who is qualified to receive the benefit:
Across the board, this is a dumb idea. It doesn’t make sense.
There is no correlation between the status of a black American, white American or brown American today and what happened with slavery.
We have had an intermixing and immigration effort that has changed and transformed the makeup of this country. You’re not even able to identify. Does Kamala Harris – is she a beneficiary? Watch the entire discussion below. FOLLOW US"
Conservatives Push Back Against the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Leftist Agenda,nationalcenter.org,David Almasi,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://nationalcenter.org/ncppr/2019/04/04/conservatives-push-back-against-the-southern-poverty-law-centers-leftist-agenda/,"Posted at 17:30h in Blog , Featured , Free Enterprise Project by David Almasi
A coalition of over 30 conservative and faith-based leaders has signed a letter to the CEOs of some of the biggest technology-related companies, asking them to “drop any and all ties” to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SLPC).
Among the signers was Justin Danhof, Esq. , the National Center’s general counsel and director of the Free Enterprise Project (FEP).
Over the years, FEP has been active in taking corporate America to task for its support of the SPLC. Some companies have not only provided financial support to the SPLC but have also allowed the group to dictate their affiliations, despite the SPLC’s dubious reputation.
While the SPLC’s left-wing politics have long made its judgment suspect , new allegations about an environment of racism and sexism permeating SPLC headquarters led to the recent ouster of founder Morris Dees, President Richard Cohen and others.
That makes this letter to the CEOs so important right now. In the letter – sent to Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and Google – Danhof and the others point out:
For years, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has branded itself the ultimate arbiter of what constitutes hate in America. You, along with the liberal media, have played a part in elevating them into this role…
However, it is now clear that the SPLC has proven to be a hate-filled, anti-Christian, anti-conservative organization and nothing more than a weapon of the radical Left, whose goal is to bully people into compliance with their ideology. Fail to comply with their demands, and you will be labeled as a hate group or an extremist.
The recent news regarding the termination of co-founder Morris Dees and resignation of president Richard Cohen are but the latest episodes that call into question SPLC’s status. There is simply no longer any defensible rationale left for an organization to use them as a point of reference or in any advisory capacity. We are writing today to demand you drop any and all affiliation with the SPLC. Moreover, you should restore your own credibility by making a public statement disavowing the SPLC and affirmatively stating that you do not have a formal or informal relationship with them.
Citing the new race and gender problems facing the SPLC, the letter additionally notes:
When combined with SPLC’s clearly demonstrated anti-Christian and anti-conservative bias, it is time for reputable organizations to cut all ties with SPLC, and denounce them as nothing more than a politically motivated tool of the Left.
While you were previously unwilling to cut ties with SPLC for targeting its political enemies with hate-filled and biased allegations, are you going to continue to work with an organization which reportedly allowed outrageous discrimination to occur for years as well? By maintaining the SPLC in an advisory capacity Facebook is embracing SPLC’s hate-filled agenda.
Organizations joining the National Center on the letter include the American Legislative Exchange Council, Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, Conservative Partnership Institute, Family Research Council and Young America’s Foundation. The Media Research Center led the effort in circulating the letter.
As the nation’s most active conservative shareholder activist organization, FEP has brought up the problem of the SPLC’s political influence in the business world for years: In 2014, FEP received a pledge from Groupon that it would be “content neutral” and not allow politics to dictate its deals. But Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (who received the new letter) refused to make a similar commitment when confronted by FEP’s request, which specifically cited the SPLC. In a 2018 shareholder proposal, FEP criticized JPMorgan Chase for making a $500,000 donation to the SPLC. Danhof then followed up by criticizing JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon about this donation at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, after which JP Morgan stopped donating to the SPLC. This year, FEP encouraged an Apple shareholder to air concern about the company’s $1 million donation to the SPLC. The individual did so in support of FEP’s shareholder proposal promoting ideological diversity within the company’s board of directors. Of course, a board with even one conservative would never allow a company to donate even a single dollar to the SPLC.
FEP also recently signed a letter to Attorney General William Barr that asked for an investigation of Facebook, Google and Twitter for possible censorship of conservative voices on their platforms, noting that they “all have a significant liberal agenda hardwired into their platforms.”
Additionally, a full-page open letter appeared in the April 4 edition of the Montgomery Advertiser , the newspaper serving the SPLC’s headquarters. The letter called for SPLC donors to suspend further support until there is a “truly independent public ombudsman to investigate financial and employment improprieties.” It also called for an end to the SPLC’s “hate map” – which it called a “cynical fundraising tool… sowing the divisions it claims to cure.”
Brian Glicklich, the letter’s author and executive director of Citizens for Corporate Accountability, noted that:
[Y]ou publish “hate map” lists that mix truly violent and hateful organizations with those guilty of no more then seeing the world differently than you. You demand that financial and tech giants stop doing business with all those on your list or face your wrath. And all too often, these public corporations do your bidding.
Glicklich added that: “It’s time for SPLC to become accountable to your own staff and the donor public.” FOLLOW US"

Fishing Report: Trout season affords great family activities,www.providencejournal.com,Dave MontiSpecial to the Journal,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/sports/20190405/fishing-report-trout-season-affords-great-family-activities,"By Dave MontiSpecial to the Journal Friday Apr 5, 2019 at 1:32 PM Apr 5, 2019 at 1:32 PM
The first day for trout season in Rhode Island is April 13 at sunrise (around 6:09 a.m.). However, the ritual of ‘Opening Day’ will start well before that time and continue throughout the weekend. Often it starts before sunrise with fresh coffee on the banks of a pond or lake, a camping trip the night before, an early morning breakfast at home or at a local diner.
If you should have the desire to participate in the ritual, it does not take a lot of effort or money to get started. April is an ideal time for families to try their hand at fishing as Rhode Island and Massachusetts waterways are stocked well with trout and it is fairly easy for beginners to catch fish. And, fishing can take place from the safety of shore while all enjoy the outdoors.
How to get started
It does not have to cost a lot to gear-up for Opening Day. Ken Ferrara of Ray’s Bait & Tackle, Warwick said, “If you have a rod and reel already all you need is $4 worth of bait and you are off fishing.” Ferrara sells treble hook rigs and sinkers for about $1.50. If a rod and reel in needed you can get a brand name rod (Daiwa), reel and line for about $29. John Littlefield of Archie’s Bait & Tackle, Riverside said, “We have fresh water spinning rigs that start at $15 for rod, reel and line. We hope to get some push button conventional reels later this week.” John Lavelle of Continental Bait & Tackle, Cranston, said, “Opening Day rigs with rod, reel and line range from $16 to $39.”
States stock ponds with hatchery raised trout that have been eating manufactured food so the bait of choice on Opening Day and early April is a prepared or formulated bait like PowerBait by Berkeley (available at sporting goods stores, bait shops and more). As the trout acclimate to the wild (two to three weeks) they begin to start foraging naturally so meal worms, other natural baits and lures work best then.
Ponds being stocked
The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management’s Division of Fish & Wildlife stocks about 100 ponds, lakes and waterways with hatchery raised brown, rainbow and brook trout with an average individual weight of one and a half pounds. Click here for a complete list of trout stocked ponds in RI. There are ponds for children 14 and younger, for fly fishing only, and some ponds are for children only just the first two days of trout season.
For information on fishing laws and regulations in Massachusetts refer to the 2019 Massachusetts Guide online at www.mass.gov/masswildlife or pick up a copy at sporting license vendor locations across the Bay State (a similar guide is available in Rhode Island).
The trout season runs year-round in some Massachusetts waterways, however, most ponds, lakes, smaller rivers and brooks have seasons that generally start April 1. In March and April Massachusetts will stock close to 500,000 brook, brown, rainbow and tiger trout. Click here for a list of stocked ponds and regulations.
Fresh water license
A 2019 fishing license is required for anglers 15 years of age and older wishing to catch fish in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
A Trout Conservation Stamp is also required in Rhode Island for anyone wishing to keep or possess a trout or to fish in a catch-and-release or 'fly-fishing only' area. Fishing licenses for residents in RI are $18 and the Trout Conservation Stamp is $5.50. They can be obtained at any city or town clerk's office, authorized agent such as bait and tackle shops, can be purchased online or obtained at DEM’s Boat Registration and Licensing Office located at 235 Promenade St. in Providence.
Licenses in Rhode Island are $33 for a combination hunting and fishing license, $35 for non-residents, and $16 for a tourist three-consecutive-day license.
In Massachusetts a freshwater residential fishing license is $27.50 and a non-resident license is $37.50. You can purchase an in state or out of state three day license. For complete Massachusetts license information and to apply for one click here.
Where’s the bite
Freshwater. Littlefield of Archie’s Bait & Tackle, said, “We have a customer that caught 11 fish last week, both largemouth bass and pike at Bad Luck Pond in Rehoboth, Mass.” John Lavelle of Continental Bait & Tackle, Cranston said, “Some larger fish have been caught in March. As soon as the ice melts the largemouth bass are hungry and when the water warms they start to feed. Our customers are doing well with shiners. Once opening day arrives local customers will be fishing at the kids only Seidel’s Pond and Meshanticut Brook but I like to point customers to Southern Rhode Island lakes and ponds where things are not as crowded. I can’t tell you all the maps I have drawn for customers.”
Cod fishing was off last week but as conditions improve the hope is that the fishing will improve too. John Littlefield of Archie’s said, “One of my good customers put his boat in early last week and went to Cox Ledge. They caught more haddock than cod but had a good day.”
Tautog season opened April 1 in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The minimum size is 16 inches. The limit until May 31 in both states is three fish/person/day. Check regulations as they change after May 31.

STAKING THEIR CLAIM,www.providencejournal.com,Michael MarotThe Associated Press,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/sports/20190405/staking-their-claim,"By Michael MarotThe Associated Press Friday Apr 5, 2019 at 11:12 PM Apr 5, 2019 at 11:12 PM
INDIANAPOLIS — Jason Tatum scored 22 points and Gordon Hayward added 21 in his return to Indianapolis on Friday night, leading the Boston Celtics to a crucial 117-97 victory over the Pacers.
The Celtics broke a tie with Indiana for the No. 4 seed in the East and essentially took a two-game lead in the chase for homecourt advantage because they won the season series, 3-1 — giving them the tiebreaker, too. Boston also is building postseason momentum with three straight wins and five in their last six games.
Indiana's two-game winning streak ended. Myles Turner led the Pacers with 15 points and seven rebounds, while Domantas Sabonis and Tyreke Evans each scored 12.
But the Celtics exposed some problems that could become major concerns for the Pacers when the teams likely meet in a first-round, best-of-seven series, starting next weekend.
They repeatedly broke down Indiana's defense — and it showed right from the start.
They jumped to a 10-3 lead out of the gate and opened the second quarter with seven straight points to turn a 27-24 deficit into a 31-27 lead.
It was only the start. An 8-0 run made it 52-40 and when the Celtics scored the final four points of the half, they led, 58-47.
Indiana didn't counterpunch much in the second half, either. Wesley Matthews opened the third quarter with a 3-pointer to cut the deficit to eight. When Tyreke Evans made one of two free throws with 4:50 left, the Pacers were within 74-65.
Boston answered with a 12-3 run to make it 86-68 and the Pacers never recovered.
Tip-ins
Celtics: Hayward went 9 of 9 from the field and 3 of 3 at the free-throw line. He also had four rebounds in his homecoming. ... Kyrie Irving had 17 points and six assists, while Al Horford, Aron Baynes and Marcus Morris each scored 11 points. ... Baynes also had 11 rebounds. Tatum and Horford each had seven rebounds. ... The Celtics won despite playing without Jaylen Brown (back spasms). ... The Celtics shot 52.2% from the field.
Pacers: Wesley Matthews scored 10 points after missing the previous two games with a strained right hamstring. ... Doug McDermott and Aaron Holiday each scored 11 points and Thaddeus Young had 10. ... Indiana was 10 of 23 on 3s and shot 41.3% from the field. ... The Pacers suffered their worst road loss of the season at Boston and their third-worst home loss this season to the Celtics. ... Point guard Darren Collison missed his third straight game with an injured groin.
Up next
Celtics: Head home to play Orlando on Sunday.
Pacers: Host Brooklyn on Sunday, chasing a second straight season sweep.

Letters: Alan Krinsky: Group overstates the costs of R.I.'s illegal aliens - News,www.providencejournal.com,providencejournal.com,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190405/letters-alan-krinsky-group-overstates-costs-of-ris-illegal-aliens,"Friday Apr 5, 2019 at 11:01 PM
In his March 27 letter (“Illegal aliens cost R.I. taxpayers $272 million”), Bruce R. Mastracchio cites data from the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) alleging that undocumented immigrants impose hundreds of millions of dollars of costs upon Rhode Island taxpayers.
The Cato Institute characterizes FAIR’s study on immigration as “vastly overstating the costs of illegal immigration, under-counting the tax revenue they generate, inflating the number of illegal immigrants, counting millions of U.S. citizens as illegal immigrants, and … concocting a method of estimating the fiscal costs that is rejected by all economists who work on this subject.”
 What we do know is that undocumented immigrants are not legally eligible for almost all government benefits, and yet these individuals pay substantial income, property and sales taxes. Indeed, according to a March 2017 report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, an estimated 29,000 undocumented immigrants in Rhode Island pay annually more than $31.2 million in taxes, including $17.6 million in sales and excise taxes, $3.9 million in income taxes, and $9.7 million in property taxes. Nationally, undocumented immigrants figure as the source of $11.74 billion in annual revenue.
We ought to recognize the contributions to our state on the part of all of its residents — of citizens, regardless of their place of birth, and of immigrants, documented or undocumented.

This didn't sound very Jeffersonian to me so I looked it up.

The passage is from Cesare Beccaria's 'Essay on Crimes and Punishments,' originally published in Italian in 1764.” Cesare Beccaria is certainly not one of the founding fathers of the United States.
In this same passage, Beccaria also criticized legislators ""who would sacrifice a thousand real advantages to the fear of an imaginary or trifling inconvenience.""
Do we as a people consider entire classrooms of children being slaughtered by military-grade weapons an imaginary or trifling inconvenience? Are 500 people being shot by one man an imaginary or trifling inconvenience? Is the traumatization of our children with regular lock-down drills an imaginary or trifling inconvenience?
I am heartened that the majority of our elected representatives support removing military-grade weaponry from our communities. When will our National Rifle Association-endorsed ""leadership"" allow this important issue to come to a vote?

This does not bode too well for us should WW3 ever come to pass.
Also interesting is that Finland is such an outlier...the Europeans in general are at the bottom, but 74% of Finns would fight...the most of all industrialized nations. This is why the Finns were man by man probably the most effective fighting force in WW2."

The fighting was not within all parts of the US. There was a clear demarcation of Union and Confederate territory. The Union had to invade a contiguous, hostile land mass.
The greater Northern population gave the Union the advantage of having an internal war goods manufacturing capacity and a greater ability to absorb battlefield casualty attrition in the long run. The South had to rely greatly on imported arms. But read the book. The advantages that the North had did not kick in till several years into the war, after the Southern leaders threw away the opportunities to use their cotton cash crop to provide the money for foreign import. The battle field advantage was initially in the South's favor. A few fatal decisions early in the war caused the South the chance to win quickly.
Once again, find a copy of the book I mentioned. It sheds a whole new light on the Civil War that the simplified standard version completly ignores."

The WTO panel ruling, the first ever on the right to a national security exemption from the global trade rules, can be appealed. The panel also confirmed the WTO's right to review national security claims, denting U.S. claims that national security was not subject to review by the global trade body. The panel also confirmed the WTO's right to review national security claims, denting U.S. claims that national security was not subject to review, and said any such claim should be ""objectively"" true, relating to weapons, war, fissionable materials or an ""emergency in international relations"". Ukraine went to the WTO in 2016, complaining of a huge reduction in trade with Asia and the Caucasus region after Russian President Vladimir Putin banned road and rail transport from Ukraine unless the route also went through Belarus.... Russia's Economy Ministry said that Friday's ruling had recognized Ukraine's arguments to be unfounded, and said the issue was of systemic importance for the WTO. ~"

Trumps tweets are some of the best, unfiltered information on his mental state. They are reactions to real-life situations in real time, over an extended span of time. Their growing frequency is an alarming sign, with an astonishing 52 tweets over 34 hours recently. Their content has also become more vitriolic. (. . .) Trumps rhetoric has been growing more violent. Attacking others seems to be a chief mode of coping for him; his accusation of Democrats behind Robert Muellers team as being ""all killers and his calling on the police, the military, and the Bikers for Trump to get tougher, appear to indicate that the stress of the presidency is getting to him. (. . .) Most markedly, he has of late been growing less and less coherent. His two-hour Conservative Political Action Conference speech revealed many rambling sentences, tangential thoughts, repetitions and word-finding difficulties. There was also the Tim Apple episode a few weeks ago, and then his calling Venezuela a company, confusing his grandfathers birthplace with his fathers, mispronouncing oranges for origins, and stating, out of the blue, Im very normal. These are signs of cognitive decline, the source of which we cannot know without examining him, but there is no question he needs an evaluation. (. . .) So the choice now seems clear: the president needs to submit to a proper, independent evaluation of fitness, or if not, he can always resign.
