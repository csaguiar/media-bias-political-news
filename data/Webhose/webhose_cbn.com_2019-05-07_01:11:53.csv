"Christmas in April: Thanks to Franklin Graham's Samaritan's Purse, a Little Joy and Hope for Venezuelan Refugee Kids",www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/christmas-in-april-thanks-to-franklin-grahams-samaritans-purse-a-little-joy-and-hope-for-venezuelan-refugee-kids,"Over the Easter weekend, hundreds of children in Cúcuta, Colombia, heard about Jesus' love for them through a Samaritan's Purse's outreach. Many of them are refugees who fled the socialist crisis in Venezuela.
Evangelist Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan's Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, joined with church partners in this Colombia-Venezuela border city to preach the gospel and to hand out Operation Christmas Child shoebox gifts to children.
Graham was in Cúcuta leading the evangelistic association's two-day Festival de Esperanza ( Festival of Hope ). The festival was held in conjunction with 400 of the city's churches. More than 116,000 people attended events over the course of outreach.
""The physical needs, I think, of the people, God sometimes uses that to open the hearts spiritually,"" Graham told CBN News. ""With all the people coming across into Colombia, suffering as they come into the country, it just opens up a door to preach the gospel.""

""There is no question of a great spiritual need among the people... not only Colombia because they just came out of a civil war. We have to remember they have had a terrible civil war and that has just ended and so the people are still reeling from that. And now we see what's happening in Venezuela next door,"" Graham said.
Before the Easter gifts were distributed to the children, Graham told the children about the ultimate gift—the sacrifice of Jesus Christ who died on the cross for all of our sins.
Chanel Contreas, a widowed mom of three, is one who crossed the border. She and her family left Venezuela in the fall of 2017 because there was no food, health care, or jobs left in her area.
""My kids grew up used to it,"" she told Samaritan's Purse. ""As a mother, I don't want them to live in that situation. I want them to be happy and healthy, both physically and emotionally.""
When her children received the shoebox gifts, Contreas was overwhelmed with gratitude and her kids with joy.
""I feel very happy to see them happy like this. This has no price. I have not seen them like this in a really long time, but I wanted to see them like this,"" she said. ""I think God's timing is perfect.""
""Every box is an opportunity to reach a child with the Gospel of Jesus Christ,"" Graham said in a press release. ""It's about telling children around the world and their families that God loves them. God hasn't forgotten them.""
Samaritan's Purse is also working to meet the practical needs of the Venezuelan refugees.
According to Samaritan's Purse, Operation Christmas Child, has been active in Colombia for more than 15 years. The organization's partner churches have distributed more than 2.4 million shoebox gifts and graduated over 700,000 children from The Greatest Journey follow-up evangelism and discipleship program
Last year, the organization started special projects in Colombia to help the Venezuelans who have migrated to escape their country's economic crisis.
One project is a relief station for migrants located just outside of Cúcuta. Migrants are provided hot meals, shower facilities, hygiene items, and a safe place to spend the night. They also get to hear the Good News of Jesus Christ from local Samaritan's Purse staff."
Journalist Uses Sri Lanka Terror Attack as Opportunity to Slam Missionaries,www.cbn.com,"Will Maule, Faithwire",04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/journalist-uses-sri-lanka-terror-attack-as-opportunity-to-slam-missionaries,"A journalist made a bizarre segue Monday when he posted an article about the Sri Lanka church terror attacks and then launched into a verbal attack of his own against foreign mission workers.
Hero Churchgoers Tackle Gun-Wielding Woman After She Points Weapon at Her Baby
Andy West, a journalist-turned-reality TV star, opened his tirade with the ominous line: “There is no excuse for terror attacks against innocent people but..”
He then went on to recall his experience of seeing “Western Christian missionaries unscrupulously converting Buddhist orphans for food and shelter after the Asian tsunami.” He gave no evidence for the wild claim before quipping, “don’t send your prayers.""

Odd timing for an anti-Christian attack I’m not sure of Mr. West’s alleged experience with Christian missionaries, but it does strike me as extremely distasteful, if not fundamentally bizarre, that he would choose to launch into a tirade of personal grievances about missiology off the back of one of the most bloody atrocities committed against the Christian community in recent memory.
In addition, West makes no attempt to substantiate his claims that missionaries prey mercilessly on the poor and swindle some sort of “food for conversion” operation that would put even the most heinous fraudster to shame.
Missionaries are incredible My personal experience with missionaries, whether it is the hard-working, compassionate and sacrificial workers sent out from my small local church, or those commissioned by larger organizations, is that they are some of the most wonderfully Jesus-like people on the planet.
In addition, there are thousands of Spirit-filled mission workers who sacrifice their personal income and comfortable lives to live in various impoverished and disease-ridden corners of the earth — and why? For the love of their neighbor. Nothing more, nothing less.
In his tirade, West argued that missionaries are known to “press one religion onto another by brainwashing desperate children,” calling this “a Western tradition that only leads to misery.”
Most - though not all - of those ""good Christian soldiers"" thought they were doing God's good work. Perhaps we should forgive people their delusions but trying to press one religion onto another by brainwashing desperate children is a Western tradition that only leads to misery.
— Andy West (@AndyWestTV) April 21, 2019
Again, I don’t know what his sources are, but I can tell you that from my own encounters with those engaging in foreign mission, this is unequivocally untrue.
“Love each other as I have loved you” See, many ministry organizations, while Christian, do not actively “evangelize” those who they have been called to serve. Instead, they love them unconditionally, as this is the type of unfathomable affection that God has shown to them through Christ Jesus.
That, Mr. West, is a wonderful and glorious thing that should never be unfairly criticized or smeared.
In fact, many of the world’s leading charitable organizations have religious origins, though they are not overtly religious or evangelistic in their activities. World Vision is a great example. Very, very few groups with any sort of global-reaching influence adhere to a sort of militant or “no-nonsense” evangelism that neglects the holistic call to love and care for the other.
So, though West’s raging against those who do their good works in the name of Jesus might be unfair, ill-advised and frankly unpleasant, let us not respond in anger. Let us instead pray for all those who have given up so much to become the hands and feet of Christ to those in need."
US Offers $10M Award for Information on Hezbollah's Terror Money Network,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/us-offers-10m-award-for-information-on-hezbollahs-terror-money-network,"The United States is offering up to $10 million to anyone who can provide ""information leading to the disruption of financial activities that support the global terrorist organization Lebanese Hezbollah,"" Assistant Secretary of Diplomatic Security Michael Evanoff announced Monday.
The State Department's initiative is called ""Rewards for Justice"" and seeks to curtail Hezbollah's terror activities in the Middle East by targeting the group's finances.
Evanoff pointed out Hezbollah's key source of income – Iran.
""The Lebanese-based terrorist organization, which the State Department designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in October 1997, receives weapons, training, funding from Iran. The Secretary of State designated Iran as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1984,"" Evanoff said during a press conference about the program.
""In previous years, Hezbollah has generated about $1 billion annually through direct financial support from Iran, international businesses and investments, donor networks, and money-laundering activities. The group uses these funds to support its malign activities throughout the world, which includes the development of militia to Syria in the support of Assad dictatorship; and to Yemen in support of the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels; surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations in the American homeland; and enhanced military capabilities, including its claim to possess precision-guided missiles,"" he added.
The US intends to stem Hezbollah's continuous flow of money through the reward offer, along with sanctions and other tools.
The State Department urges anyone with information on Hezbollah's financial networks to contact the Rewards for Justice Program through its website, rewardsforjustice.net or via email at [email protected] .
Individuals outside the United States may also contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. All information submitted will be kept strictly confidential.
The State Department also highlighted three key individuals as Hezbollah financiers or leaders, including Adham Tabaja, Mohammad Ibrahim Bazzi and Ali Youssef Charara.
""We will pay for bank records, customs forms, real estate transactions, and anything evidencing money laundering or cash smuggling,"" Evanoff said. ""The United States government is prepared to pay for this information, and we will award up to $10 million for leads that result in financial disruption. Whether by US law enforcement sanctions or other enforcement actions.""
This is not the first time the US has offered money in exchange for information on terrorists.
The United States Government has paid more than $150 million to over a hundred people who have provided critical information that resulted in the imprisonment of terrorists or prevents them from participating in acts of international terrorism.
""I'm confident that the (reward) that we are offering today, will provide incentives for people to come forward with information that will help us take down Hezbollah's financial networks,"" said Evanoff."

Getting the Immigrants We Need,www1.cbn.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/getting-the-immigrants-we-need,"Getting the Immigrants We Need 04-23-2019 Stephen Moore COMMENTARY
Of all America's immigrant visa programs, arguably the most successful for the US economy has been the H1B program. This program admits highly-skilled foreigners that fill vital employment niches to make our made-in-America businesses more successful in international markets. Larry Kudlow, the director of President Donald Trump's National Economic Council, calls these immigrants the ""brainiacs.""
In many ways, he is right. America's high tech companies use tens of thousands of these visas each year. The workers come for usually about six years, those that are successful here apply for permanent residence when the visa expires.
The firms that use these visas must not displace American workers or pay sub-standard wages. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has testified that every H1B immigrant his firm recruits, translates into about five additional American workers being hired. If we want research labs, advanced manufacturing and scientific advance to happen here, we must have access to the world's best workers.
The problem is there is a severe shortage of these visas. In 2018 there were only some 65,000 science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) immigrants admitted under this visa category. Employers have requested about 200,000, according to Forbes. This mismatch between demand and supply is restraining America's growth spree.
The H1B process is cumbersome and expensive for employers and they wouldn't spend the money on the program if they were not desperate for these talented newcomers. In the last decade or so, the processing time and costs have nearly doubled to get an H1B immigrant admitted to these shores. This is a drain on the economy and reduces American competitiveness.
I travel the nation from coast to coast and talk to employers from large manufacturers, to high tech firms, to engineering and financial services. Most tell me their biggest challenge is finding the skilled workers they need.
The visa limits should be raised and adjusted to meet the demands. The feds should charge employers a higher fee to bring these immigrants to the country and these funds could be used to beef up border security and pay for the cost of administering visa programs.
The solution is to tilt our immigration system away from extended family immigrants and more toward skills and merit. To put America first, it makes sense to give green cards to the immigrants who will do the most good for our country. Most other countries stress skills and workplace needs higher than family and other categories.
President Trump wants to shift our visa system to emphasize skill and merit and Congress should get behind him. Skill-based immigration is one of our best weapons to keep the American economy No. 1 in the world and to ensure we never surrender technological dominance to the Chinese or other rising nations, who want to knock America off our commanding economic heights.

'This Is Resurrection Power': 5-Year-Old Thrown from Mall of America Balcony Has No Brain Damage,www1.cbn.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/this-is-resurrection-power-5-year-old-thrown-from-mall-of-america-balcony-has-no-brain-damage,"'This Is Resurrection Power': 5-Year-Old Thrown from Mall of America Balcony Has No Brain Damage 04-23-2019 Talia Wise Landen Hoffman
A five-year-old boy who was attacked and viciously thrown from the third floor of the Mall of America is defying the odds and stunning doctors in what is being called a ""miracle"", according to the pastor at the family's church.
Landen Hoffman was shopping with his mother and friends on April 12 when he was thrown over the rail of a balcony by 24-year-old Emmanuel Aranda.
Aranda told police that he had gone to the mall intending to kill an adult ""because they usually stand near the balcony"" but it did not ""work out.""
Aranda is now being charged with first degree attempted premeditated murder.
""It is a miracle he wasn't killed,"" Pastor Mac Hammond told the congregation.
Hammond leads Living Word Christian Church in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota and shared an update with the church Easter Sunday.
Hammond and his wife visited the family last week to encourage them, pray, and bring communion after the incident.
Landen fell to the first floor and suffered from broken arms and legs and until recently it was believed that he suffered significant head trauma.
However, Hammond told the church that he received a call from Landen's grandfather with good news after a five hour MRI to determine the full extent of the boy's injuries.
""There was zero evidence of brain damage - there wasn't even swelling in the brain,"" Hammond said Sunday. ""No spinal cord injury, no nerve damage, no internal injuries that were life-threatening.""

Hammond added that one of his attending physicians marveled at Landen's health.
""This is truly a miracle. It's like he fell off a bicycle instead of off the third floor of the mall,"" Hammond said recounting the physician's words.
Hammond also shared during the message that the Holy Spirit had given Landen's mother a warning just before they met friends at the mall that day.
""In her words, a dread came over, but she didn't feel like she could leave because she was supposed to meet this other mom and son there,"" Hammond explained.
But he says she did the only thing she knew to do -- she prayed.
""She called on the ministering angels to hedge him about,"" Hammond recalled.
Although mall goers were heard screaming as Landen landed, witnesses say his mother was heard yelling ""just pray!""
Hammond told the church it was an Easter miracle.
""This is resurrection power...this is what the Word will do. It'll open up power to you to restore whatever the enemy is able to bring about or fend him off completely.""
According to a recent post on the GoFundMe page set up for the family, Landen is ""showing real signs of recovery.""
The fundraising campaign has raised nearly $1 million to help cover the cost of medical treatments and rehabilitative programs."
"Regret Taking an Abortion Pill? You Can Reverse It, but States Are Debating if Doctors Should Tell You",www1.cbn.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/regret-taking-an-abortion-pill-you-can-reverse-it-but-states-are-debating-if-doctors-should-tell-you,"Homepage Health News CBNNews.com Regret Taking an Abortion Pill? You Can Reverse It, but States Are Debating if Doctors Should Tell You 04-23-2019 Heather Sells
Once a woman takes an abortion pill, she has 72 hours to change her mind and take doctor-prescribed progesterone to reverse the abortion.
Whether doctors and clinics should be required to tell patients about this option is the subject of a debate in at least four states right now. Americans United for Life says they include: Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Kansas.
Seven states have already enacted laws that mandate patients receive the information.
In Kansas this week, the new Democratic Governor Laura Kelly vetoed an abortion reversal measure.
""This unwarranted legislation will create confusion and could be harmful to women's health,"" she said. ""The practice of medicine should be left to licensed health professionals, not elected officials.""
The Kansas Senate President, Republican Susan Wagle, has tweeted just the opposite. The bill, she said, would allow women ""to make an informed decision about their pregnancy.""
Nationwide, the Abortion Pill Rescue Network reports that more than 500 babies have been born with 150 more on the way, thanks to the treatment developed by Drs. George Delgado and Matthew Harrison in 2007.
The babies' mothers are utilizing a round-the-clock hotline (877-558-0333) that links them with 400 medical practitioners across the country who can prescribe the progesterone needed to reverse their abortion within the crucial 72-hour window.
Abortion Reversal Research
A 2018 peer-reviewed study published by Dr. Delgado in the medical journal Issues in Law and Medicine followed 754 women who wanted to stop their abortion after taking the first dose of the abortion pill known as RU-486. Their findings? Sixty-eight percent who started the reversal treatment were able to give birth to a healthy baby.
The study found no increase in birth defects, compared to the general population. It also found that the women enjoyed a lower preterm delivery rate than the general population.
Still, abortion rights supporters say that more testing is needed in order for doctors to confidently recommend the procedure.
Gov. Kelly says it ""is not adequately supported by medical science"" and Wichita abortion provider Julie Burkhart says ""requiring doctors to provide unscientific and unproven information violates the private relationship between women and their medical providers.""
Abortion reversal supporters contend that no woman who questions her chemical abortion after she's taken the first pill should feel that she must continue it and they argue that the results over the last 12 years along with the peer-reviewed study should encourage women who want to use the treatment and save their child.
Jor-El Godsey, president of Heartbeat International which oversees the Abortion Pill Reversal Network and hotline, calls the reversal procedure ""an absolute lifeline to the very woman who needs our help most. No woman should need to finish an abortion she regrets--especially when there may be time to save her child's life."""

Parents Pray for Kenyan Court to Order Reunion with Their 'Stolen' Son,www1.cbn.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/parents-pray-for-kenyan-court-to-order-reunion-with-their-stolen-son,"Kiano with his father, Matt, on safari 6029239605001 Parents Pray for Kenyan Court to Order Reunion with Their 'Stolen' Son
On a night not unlike most others, Matt and Daisy Mazzoncini were winding down in the comfort of their home with their three year old, Kiano.
Their peaceful evening on April 5, 2019 was abruptly interrupted when a group of about a dozen people bombarded their apartment in Nairobi, Kenya and took their son.
""Out of nowhere, these people came to our house. It was like 13 people,"" Daisy recounts in a YouTube video titled ""Bring Kiano Home.""
""I felt shoulders and hands – a huge force, and they said, 'We're all police. We're all police,'"" Matt added.
The ""abduction"" – as the Mazzoncinis now refer to it – happened a few weeks before Easter. Up to that point, they had been looking forward to celebrating the holiday with Kiano, a child whose story could easily be described as a miracle itself – much like the one they were about to commemorate as Christians.
Three weeks later, with the whereabouts and the safety of their son still unknown, they are left as confused and brokenhearted as Jesus's disciples immediately following the crucifixion.
Miraculous Discovery and Survival
In January 2016, the day after the start of the New Year, a gardener discovered a plastic bag at a prayer center in Kiambu, near the capital of Nairobi.
Inside were twin baby boys, abandoned and in critical need of medical care. Rushed to the hospital, the medical staff named the boys James and John. Only one survived and would be placed in a shelter for infants.
That summer, Daisy landed in Kenya for what was intended to be a summer visit with family friends and volunteer work that eventually led her to a shelter. That's where she met a nearly eight-month-old baby named John, whose health was severely in decline.
Matt and Daisy prayed for the boy and paid for his nearly two week hospital stay – with one full week in ICU to treat problems with his breathing, pneumonia, and malnutrition.
The couple continued funding his health care needs and eventually applied for and were granted legal guardianship of baby John by the Nairobi Children's Court in April 2017. After seven years of marriage, Matt and Daisy were grateful that their family was finally growing – though thousands of miles from their home in the US.
""We always knew we wanted to be parents,"" Daisy told CBN News in a phone interview. ""We struggled with infertility, which was really a hard season. And through that God opened our heart to adoption.""
They legally added ""Kiano"" to baby John's name, which – in his native Kenya – means ""full of joy.""
""We, obviously, love Kiano like he is a birth child. He's the child that God gave us and that we love so much,"" she added.
Happily Ever Delayed
Though joyful, Kiano still suffered from a complex medical history with epileptic seizures. At one point in 2018, doctors placed him into a medically induced coma after a continuous six hour seizing episode.
At the advice of several Kenyan doctors and a letter from a specialist in Tennessee who reviewed Kiano’s case, Matt and Daisy petitioned to travel abroad to seek urgent medical care for their son or possibly risk long-term damage or developmental delay.
According to the daily Star newspaper in Nairobi, that request ""triggered an avalanche of harassment,"" including accusations of abuse, fabricated medical reports, and child trafficking alleged by the Child Welfare Society of Kenya. The couple, Matt an American and Daisy a dual American and English citizen, believe the group has injected these claims to paint them as unfit foreign parents.
The Child Welfare Society describes itself as a state corporation for the ""care, protection, welfare and adoption of children"" on its website. It has requested to be part of the family's legal proceedings as an ""interested party.""
The group's critics claim the agency's mission is entirely different.
""It is a big cartel that needs to be looked into,"" Peter Kamau, founder of Child in Family Focus - Kenya, said in the "" Bring Kiano Home "" video.
""Baby Kiano, unfortunately, is a victim of something that is not about the interest of children,"" he explained. ""It is about money. It's about power, and it's about elevating Child Welfare Society of Kenya . . . so that they get the monopoly.""
A response to CBN's questions about the organization's involvement in this case were not answered at the time of publication.
Bringing the Story to Light
Nearly three weeks after Kiano was taken, Matt and Daisy still have many questions.
""I don't understand why they accused us of all these things?"" Daisy asked. ""Yet no one's come to investigate us. No one's arrested us?""
But they think they've formed a framework that may explain their situation.
""We believe this is happening because we have refused to be extorted. We have refused to bribe,"" she said. ""At every turn, we've done everything through the court – through the government.""
They think their story is not uncommon.
""We believe there are other people out there that have experienced this same sort of intimidation and harassment and extortion,"" Matt is featured saying in the video . ""We've had people reach out to us anonymously and say this happened to me and they're totally afraid to talk about it. So to those people I would say have courage.""
""We're speaking out, and we want everyone that has ever experienced anything like this to speak out, because if we bring this issue into the light, it's something that we know will be addressed. But the first step is that we all tell our stories and that we show that this is real, and it's really happening and it's hurting kids.""
The couple have a court date Wednesday, April 24, when they expect a judge to issue an order for the child to appear in court. Meanwhile, they have been trying to stay positive.
""We're hoping that he'll be returned to us on Wednesday, but if not, then the order would be for [Kiano] to be produced on Thursday,"" Daisy told CBN News . ""As a parent, it's sickening that it's taken this long.""
International Support
The family's story is gaining traction and support.
The Star article includes a brief 2-minute video with background information and concludes with Matt and Daisy making an emotional appeal for their son and his wellbeing. They are concerned about what happens if Kiano doesn't receive the medication to treat his seizures.
""They took our baby. They took our baby!"" Daisy cried, interrupting her husband's account of the night when Kiano was taken from their home.
""He must be so frightened, and we don't even know if he's had his medication. Please let him come home,"" she sobbed.
The heartbreaking appeal has touched a nerve with Christians who have rallied in support of the family. LightWorkers published a story urging people to pray.
The Mazzoncini's plight has even attracted help from a few big name celebrities.
British singer Natasha Bedingfield pleaded for her Twitter followers to pray for Daisy, whom she has known since childhood.
""My close friend's baby has just been kidnapped! Please pray,"" she wrote on Twitter. My friend's kid has been kidnapped - please read and share https://t.co/VoJfmJOl1z
— Natasha Bedingfield (@natashabdnfield) April12, 2019
Singer songwriter Ed Sheeran posted a story on Instagram with the hashtag ""Bring Kiano Home."" Macklemore, the American rapper, also retweeted a post by music video director Jason Koenig using the same hashtag. My best friend's child was abducted in Kenya. Friends please share and retweet to help #BringKianoHome . @BBCNews will you look into this? @StateHouseKenya can you help https://t.co/UOCU9gaNn1
— Jason Koenig (@jkoephoto) April 23, 2019
His parents appreciate the support and ask people to keep praying for their family to be reunited.
""The thing that we pray every night is, first, that Kiano would feel safe somehow,"" Matt told CBN News . ""Being taken away from his parents is traumatic.""
""So we pray that God would protect his mind and protect his heart . . . and get him the medical treatment that he needs — and be restored as a family,"" he continued.

Getting the Immigrants We Need,www.cbn.com,Stephen Moore,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/getting-the-immigrants-we-need,"COMMENTARY Of all America's immigrant visa programs, arguably the most successful for the US economy has been the H1B program. This program admits highly-skilled foreigners that fill vital employment niches to make our made-in-America businesses more successful in international markets. Larry Kudlow, the director of President Donald Trump's National Economic Council, calls these immigrants the ""brainiacs.""
In many ways, he is right. America's high tech companies use tens of thousands of these visas each year. The workers come for usually about six years, those that are successful here apply for permanent residence when the visa expires.
The firms that use these visas must not displace American workers or pay sub-standard wages. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has testified that every H1B immigrant his firm recruits, translates into about five additional American workers being hired. If we want research labs, advanced manufacturing and scientific advance to happen here, we must have access to the world's best workers.
The problem is there is a severe shortage of these visas. In 2018 there were only some 65,000 science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) immigrants admitted under this visa category. Employers have requested about 200,000, according to Forbes. This mismatch between demand and supply is restraining America's growth spree.
The H1B process is cumbersome and expensive for employers and they wouldn't spend the money on the program if they were not desperate for these talented newcomers. In the last decade or so, the processing time and costs have nearly doubled to get an H1B immigrant admitted to these shores. This is a drain on the economy and reduces American competitiveness.
I travel the nation from coast to coast and talk to employers from large manufacturers, to high tech firms, to engineering and financial services. Most tell me their biggest challenge is finding the skilled workers they need.
The visa limits should be raised and adjusted to meet the demands. The feds should charge employers a higher fee to bring these immigrants to the country and these funds could be used to beef up border security and pay for the cost of administering visa programs.
The solution is to tilt our immigration system away from extended family immigrants and more toward skills and merit. To put America first, it makes sense to give green cards to the immigrants who will do the most good for our country. Most other countries stress skills and workplace needs higher than family and other categories.
President Trump wants to shift our visa system to emphasize skill and merit and Congress should get behind him. Skill-based immigration is one of our best weapons to keep the American economy No. 1 in the world and to ensure we never surrender technological dominance to the Chinese or other rising nations, who want to knock America off our commanding economic heights.

'This Is Resurrection Power': 5-Year-Old Thrown from Mall of America Balcony Has No Brain Damage,www.cbn.com,Talia Wise,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/this-is-resurrection-power-5-year-old-thrown-from-mall-of-america-balcony-has-no-brain-damage,"A five-year-old boy who was attacked and viciously thrown from the third floor of the Mall of America is defying the odds and stunning doctors in what is being called a ""miracle"", according to the pastor at the family's church.
Landen Hoffman was shopping with his mother and friends on April 12 when he was thrown over the rail of a balcony by 24-year-old Emmanuel Aranda.
Aranda told police that he had gone to the mall intending to kill an adult ""because they usually stand near the balcony"" but it did not ""work out.""
Aranda is now being charged with first degree attempted premeditated murder.
""It is a miracle he wasn't killed,"" Pastor Mac Hammond told the congregation.
Hammond leads Living Word Christian Church in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota and shared an update with the church Easter Sunday.
Hammond and his wife visited the family last week to encourage them, pray, and bring communion after the incident.
Landen fell to the first floor and suffered from broken arms and legs and until recently it was believed that he suffered significant head trauma.
However, Hammond told the church that he received a call from Landen's grandfather with good news after a five hour MRI to determine the full extent of the boy's injuries.
""There was zero evidence of brain damage - there wasn't even swelling in the brain,"" Hammond said Sunday. ""No spinal cord injury, no nerve damage, no internal injuries that were life-threatening.""

Hammond added that one of his attending physicians marveled at Landen's health.
""This is truly a miracle. It's like he fell off a bicycle instead of off the third floor of the mall,"" Hammond said recounting the physician's words.
Hammond also shared during the message that the Holy Spirit had given Landen's mother a warning just before they met friends at the mall that day.
""In her words, a dread came over, but she didn't feel like she could leave because she was supposed to meet this other mom and son there,"" Hammond explained.
But he says she did the only thing she knew to do -- she prayed.
""She called on the ministering angels to hedge him about,"" Hammond recalled.
Although mall goers were heard screaming as Landen landed, witnesses say his mother was heard yelling ""just pray!""
Hammond told the church it was an Easter miracle.
""This is resurrection power...this is what the Word will do. It'll open up power to you to restore whatever the enemy is able to bring about or fend him off completely.""
According to a recent post on the GoFundMe page set up for the family, Landen is ""showing real signs of recovery.""

Parents Pray for Kenyan Court to Order Reunion with Their 'Stolen' Son,www.cbn.com,John Jessup,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/parents-pray-for-kenyan-court-to-order-reunion-with-their-stolen-son,"On a night not unlike most others, Matt and Daisy Mazzoncini were winding down in the comfort of their home with their three year old, Kiano.
Their peaceful evening on April 5, 2019 was abruptly interrupted when a group of about a dozen people bombarded their apartment in Nairobi, Kenya and took their son.
""Out of nowhere, these people came to our house. It was like 13 people,"" Daisy recounts in a YouTube video titled ""Bring Kiano Home.""
""I felt shoulders and hands – a huge force, and they said, 'We're all police. We're all police,'"" Matt added.
The ""abduction"" – as the Mazzoncinis now refer to it – happened a few weeks before Easter. Up to that point, they had been looking forward to celebrating the holiday with Kiano, a child whose story could easily be described as a miracle itself – much like the one they were about to commemorate as Christians.
Three weeks later, with the whereabouts and the safety of their son still unknown, they are left as confused and brokenhearted as Jesus's disciples immediately following the crucifixion.
Miraculous Discovery and Survival
In January 2016, the day after the start of the New Year, a gardener discovered a plastic bag at a prayer center in Kiambu, near the capital of Nairobi.
Inside were twin baby boys, abandoned and in critical need of medical care. Rushed to the hospital, the medical staff named the boys James and John. Only one survived and would be placed in a shelter for infants.
That summer, Daisy landed in Kenya for what was intended to be a summer visit with family friends and volunteer work that eventually led her to a shelter. That's where she met a nearly eight-month-old baby named John, whose health was severely in decline.
Matt and Daisy prayed for the boy and paid for his nearly two week hospital stay – with one full week in ICU to treat problems with his breathing, pneumonia, and malnutrition.
The couple continued funding his health care needs and eventually applied for and were granted legal guardianship of baby John by the Nairobi Children's Court in April 2017. After seven years of marriage, Matt and Daisy were grateful that their family was finally growing – though thousands of miles from their home in the US.
""We always knew we wanted to be parents,"" Daisy told CBN News in a phone interview. ""We struggled with infertility, which was really a hard season. And through that God opened our heart to adoption.""
They legally added ""Kiano"" to baby John's name, which – in his native Kenya – means ""full of joy.""
""We, obviously, love Kiano like he is a birth child. He's the child that God gave us and that we love so much,"" she added.
Happily Ever Delayed
Though joyful, Kiano still suffered from a complex medical history with epileptic seizures. At one point in 2018, doctors placed him into a medically induced coma after a continuous six hour seizing episode.
At the advice of several Kenyan doctors and a letter from a specialist in Tennessee who reviewed Kiano’s case, Matt and Daisy petitioned to travel abroad to seek urgent medical care for their son or possibly risk long-term damage or developmental delay.
According to the daily Star newspaper in Nairobi, that request ""triggered an avalanche of harassment,"" including accusations of abuse, fabricated medical reports, and child trafficking alleged by the Child Welfare Society of Kenya. The couple, Matt an American and Daisy a dual American and English citizen, believe the group has injected these claims to paint them as unfit foreign parents.
The Child Welfare Society describes itself as a state corporation for the ""care, protection, welfare and adoption of children"" on its website. It has requested to be part of the family's legal proceedings as an ""interested party.""
The group's critics claim the agency's mission is entirely different.
""It is a big cartel that needs to be looked into,"" Peter Kamau, founder of Child in Family Focus - Kenya, said in the "" Bring Kiano Home "" video.
""Baby Kiano, unfortunately, is a victim of something that is not about the interest of children,"" he explained. ""It is about money. It's about power, and it's about elevating Child Welfare Society of Kenya . . . so that they get the monopoly.""
A response to CBN's questions about the organization's involvement in this case were not answered at the time of publication.
Bringing the Story to Light
Nearly three weeks after Kiano was taken, Matt and Daisy still have many questions.
""I don't understand why they accused us of all these things?"" Daisy asked. ""Yet no one's come to investigate us. No one's arrested us?""
But they think they've formed a framework that may explain their situation.
""We believe this is happening because we have refused to be extorted. We have refused to bribe,"" she said. ""At every turn, we've done everything through the court – through the government.""
They think their story is not uncommon.
""We believe there are other people out there that have experienced this same sort of intimidation and harassment and extortion,"" Matt is featured saying in the video . ""We've had people reach out to us anonymously and say this happened to me and they're totally afraid to talk about it. So to those people I would say have courage.""
""We're speaking out, and we want everyone that has ever experienced anything like this to speak out, because if we bring this issue into the light, it's something that we know will be addressed. But the first step is that we all tell our stories and that we show that this is real, and it's really happening and it's hurting kids.""
The couple have a court date Wednesday, April 24, when they expect a judge to issue an order for the child to appear in court. Meanwhile, they have been trying to stay positive.
""We're hoping that he'll be returned to us on Wednesday, but if not, then the order would be for [Kiano] to be produced on Thursday,"" Daisy told CBN News . ""As a parent, it's sickening that it's taken this long.""
International Support
The family's story is gaining traction and support.
The Star article includes a brief 2-minute video with background information and concludes with Matt and Daisy making an emotional appeal for their son and his wellbeing. They are concerned about what happens if Kiano doesn't receive the medication to treat his seizures.
""They took our baby. They took our baby!"" Daisy cried, interrupting her husband's account of the night when Kiano was taken from their home.
""He must be so frightened, and we don't even know if he's had his medication. Please let him come home,"" she sobbed.
The heartbreaking appeal has touched a nerve with Christians who have rallied in support of the family. LightWorkers published a story urging people to pray.
The Mazzoncini's plight has even attracted help from a few big name celebrities.
British singer Natasha Bedingfield pleaded for her Twitter followers to pray for Daisy, whom she has known since childhood.
""My close friend's baby has just been kidnapped! Please pray,"" she wrote on Twitter.
My friend's kid has been kidnapped - please read and share https://t.co/VoJfmJOl1z
— Natasha Bedingfield (@natashabdnfield) April12, 2019
Singer songwriter Ed Sheeran posted a story on Instagram with the hashtag ""Bring Kiano Home."" Macklemore, the American rapper, also retweeted a post by music video director Jason Koenig using the same hashtag.
My best friend's child was abducted in Kenya. Friends please share and retweet to help #BringKianoHome . @BBCNews will you look into this? @StateHouseKenya can you help https://t.co/UOCU9gaNn1
— Jason Koenig (@jkoephoto) April 23, 2019
His parents appreciate the support and ask people to keep praying for their family to be reunited.
""The thing that we pray every night is, first, that Kiano would feel safe somehow,"" Matt told CBN News . ""Being taken away from his parents is traumatic.""
""So we pray that God would protect his mind and protect his heart . . . and get him the medical treatment that he needs — and be restored as a family,"" he continued.
The LightWorkers article said the American Embassy was able to deliver Kiano's anti-epilepsy medication to Kenyan officials as they care for the child.
Still his parents remain hopeful for yet another miracle with a positive Kenyan solution.
""We love Kenya. I've always had a heart for Africa,"" Daisy explained to CBN News . ""It's a beautiful country. The people are hospitable and kind and family-oriented.""
""And, obviously, our son is Kenyan. We fell in love with our Kenyan boy,"" she said."
"Regret Taking an Abortion Pill? You Can Reverse It, but States Are Debating if Doctors Should Tell You",www.cbn.com,Heather Sells,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/regret-taking-an-abortion-pill-you-can-reverse-it-but-states-are-debating-if-doctors-should-tell-you,"Once a woman takes an abortion pill, she has 72 hours to change her mind and take doctor-prescribed progesterone to reverse the abortion.
Whether doctors and clinics should be required to tell patients about this option is the subject of a debate in at least four states right now. Americans United for Life says they include: Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Kansas.
Seven states have already enacted laws that mandate patients receive the information.
In Kansas this week, the new Democratic Governor Laura Kelly vetoed an abortion reversal measure.
""This unwarranted legislation will create confusion and could be harmful to women's health,"" she said. ""The practice of medicine should be left to licensed health professionals, not elected officials.""
The Kansas Senate President, Republican Susan Wagle, has tweeted just the opposite. The bill, she said, would allow women ""to make an informed decision about their pregnancy.""
Nationwide, the Abortion Pill Rescue Network reports that more than 500 babies have been born with 150 more on the way, thanks to the treatment developed by Drs. George Delgado and Matthew Harrison in 2007.
The babies' mothers are utilizing a round-the-clock hotline (877-558-0333) that links them with 400 medical practitioners across the country who can prescribe the progesterone needed to reverse their abortion within the crucial 72-hour window.
Abortion Reversal Research
A 2018 peer-reviewed study published by Dr. Delgado in the medical journal Issues in Law and Medicine followed 754 women who wanted to stop their abortion after taking the first dose of the abortion pill known as RU-486. Their findings? Sixty-eight percent who started the reversal treatment were able to give birth to a healthy baby.
The study found no increase in birth defects, compared to the general population. It also found that the women enjoyed a lower preterm delivery rate than the general population.
Still, abortion rights supporters say that more testing is needed in order for doctors to confidently recommend the procedure.
Gov. Kelly says it ""is not adequately supported by medical science"" and Wichita abortion provider Julie Burkhart says ""requiring doctors to provide unscientific and unproven information violates the private relationship between women and their medical providers.""
Abortion reversal supporters contend that no woman who questions her chemical abortion after she's taken the first pill should feel that she must continue it and they argue that the results over the last 12 years along with the peer-reviewed study should encourage women who want to use the treatment and save their child.
Jor-El Godsey, president of Heartbeat International which oversees the Abortion Pill Reversal Network and hotline, calls the reversal procedure ""an absolute lifeline to the very woman who needs our help most. No woman should need to finish an abortion she regrets--especially when there may be time to save her child's life."""

Dave Adamson: The Price of Christian Free Speech - CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/dave-adamson-the-price-of-christian-free-speech,"Dave Adamson: The Price of Christian Free Speech 04-18-2019
COMMENTARY
This op-ed originally published on Fox News, republished here by permission from the author.
I am a Christian who is all for free speech—but freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences.
After my last op-ed for Fox News, which was about the future of the church, I received thousands of negative comments from other Christians. People even tracked down my email address so they could personally inbox their animosity. One follower of Jesus emailed to tell me I was personally responsible for an increase in school shootings. Another said my ""way of thinking is what makes people kill themselves.""
And this is just one, small example of how Christians are so quick to turn on other Christians online. As soon as there's a difference of opinion, Christians undo Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane that we would be one as God and Jesus are one, by piling on unmerited personal insults.
While Jesus said we should love one another, treat others kindly, and pray for people regularly, it seems his followers prefer to troll one another, tweet about others maliciously, and prey on people. And when Christians take to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to attack each other with irresponsible, non-empathetic vitriol, it's our faith that suffers.
While First Century followers of Jesus were known for their love and compassion, 21st-century followers of Jesus are renowned for our vitriol and animosity. How did our reputation devolve to this place?
I've watched Christians routinely justify their criticism with Jesus' words in Matthew 18:15-20, telling ourselves that we have the religious duty to confront fellow believers with their ""sin"". But in doing so, we deliberately step over the application of this passage, which comes when Jesus tells us to treat people who refuse our correction as a ""Gentile and a tax collector"" (verse 17). Do you remember how Jesus treated Gentiles and tax collectors? He visited their homes. He ate with them. He had compassion for them. He served them. He loved them.
What do Jesus' followers do in the age of social media? We vilify them in the comments section.
Instead of using scripture to start conversations like Jesus so often did, we use scripture to end conversations. But as author Bob Goff says; ""Jesus told the people he was with that it's not enough to just look like you love God. He said we'd know the extent of our love for God by how well we loved people.""
And which people should we love? That's easy right: those with the same theology, lifestyle, financial status, political views, skin color, nationality, family background, traditions, customs, and overall approach to life, right?
Well, when Jesus was asked who we should love by a religious expert, he said we should love everyone—including those we are most different from. Jesus answered this question by telling a story we know as The Good Samaritan. Nowadays, we use this story to represent the importance of roadside assistance—but that wasn't the point when Jesus told the parable. To the Jews listening to Jesus, the Samaritans were the most despised of people groups. To them, there was no such thing as a ""good"" Samaritan because they believed there was not an ounce of good in Samaritans! It would be like saying someone was a ""good white supremacist.""
But by making the morally inferior, theologically incorrect, racially despised Samaritan the hero of the story, Jesus was saying we should love ALL of our neighbors—even those we disagree with, who frustrate us, who have a completely opposite world view, who vote differently, and even those people who have hurt us.
This is, of course, easier said than done, but it starts by asking who the ""Samaritan"" is in your life. Who is the person, or people group, you most despise?
For me, it's the uncle who sexually abused me from the age of six until I was 11. This man caused me to grow up feeling scared, worthless, rejected, and ashamed—am I supposed to treat him kindly Jesus? Am I supposed to pray for him?
According to Jesus, yes. Simple to say, extremely hard to do. Now, that doesn't mean I should have him in my life, and if you've been abused by someone, they don't have to be part of yours. But Jesus didn't call us to respond with malice and vindictiveness to people who mistreat, disrespect, hurt, or offend us—even when it is justified. He called us to the exact opposite—to love.
The world says revenge, retribution and retaliation are justified—but if Christians are going to make a difference in the world, we have to be different from the world. As pastor Andy Stanley says; ""Imagine a world where unbelievers were skeptical of what we believed, but envious of how we treated one another.""
I'm sure some reading this are already winding up to lob unkind words, trolling comments and angry emails my way … I just hope and pray the Christians reading this will see that the world is changed by our example, not our angry opinions—and we are changed by the example of Jesus.

With only a $6 million budget, Pureflix's pro-life movie started making a profit on its opening weekend, after debuting with $6.1 million.
But box office success isn't the only goal for the film's supporters. It's about changing hearts and lives. So one group is even planning to air the film on the public sidewalk right in front of the Planned Parenthood abortion clinic in Washington, DC at 1225 4th St. NE.
Their original plan to show it on Good Friday was delayed by weather, but they're still planning to show it at that location. More here.
""Our hope is to launch a nationwide campaign to eventually show 'Unplanned' in front of Planned Parenthood abortion clinics across America,"" explained Rev. Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition which is sponsoring this special viewing.
The film's success comes despite roadblocks from the entertainment industry.
""'Unplanned' has been censored and discriminated against by social media giants, television networks and other outlets,"" Mahoney says. He says it has faced an unprecedented blockade from Google and Twitter, with ads also being blocked by TV networks like Hallmark, Bravo, The Food Network, and Lifetime.
The movie is based on the pro-life transformation of a former Planned Parenthood abortion clinic director named Abby Johnson.
CBN News recently reported close to 100 abortion clinic workers have left their jobs since seeing the film.
During his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, Chuck Konzelman, director of ""Unplanned"", said 94 clinic workers have approached Abby Johnson's nonprofit, And Then There Were None , about leaving the abortion industry, according to Pure Flix Insider.
In a recent interview with Fox News, Ashley Bratcher, the actress who portrays Abby Johnson, shared her response to the impact the movie has made on many lives.
""The response had been incredibly positive. I mean, through it all – this has been the most rewarding and fulfilling role I've ever had in my entire career,"" Bratcher told 'Fox & Friends'. ""To be able to hear someone come up to you and say, 'I was so affected by your work that I decided instead of having an abortion, that I'm now going to have my child' – I don't know how to really explain the way that feels to know that you could have potentially just saved a life.""
""There's not a lot of actors who get to say that, and I am so honored to be able to have a part of this,"" she added.
Abby Johnson recently joined senior pastor of megachurch Free Chapel Church, Jentezen Franklin, for his 'Life Is Beautiful' Conference. More than 4,000 people were encouraged to speak out against abortion at the event.
Franklin encouraged grace for those who had an abortion or worked in abortion industry.
""With just as much passion and just as much fervency, we are going to extend grace and compassion to anyone who has experienced an abortion, been anyway involved in it, we're not mad at you. Jesus loves you and we love you. And we're here to walk through life. We're all flawed people. We need God's grace,"" he said. ""We can make our world a place that values life because life is beautiful.""

Kushner: Israeli-Palestinian Peace Plan Will Require 'Tough Compromises' for Both Sides,www1.cbn.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/kushner-israeli-palestinian-peace-plan-will-require-tough-compromises-for-both-sides,"Kushner: Israeli-Palestinian Peace Plan Will Require 'Tough Compromises' for Both Sides 04-24-2019 Emily Jones
President Donald Trump's Senior Advisor Jared Kushner shed light Tuesday on the Trump administration's highly-anticipated ""Deal of the Century"" peace-plan that will be presented to Israelis and Palestinians in the coming weeks.
Kushner, who has been tasked with overseeing the proposal process, said his team is taking a different approach than previous attempts to end the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
""I mean it's about as tough of a problem set as you can get and so I think we've taken I think an unconventional approach,"" he said during an interview at the 2019 TIME 100 Summit.
""We've studied, you know, all the different past efforts and how they've failed and why they've failed. And there's been some tremendous work done by the people who worked on this before us. So, we've tried to do it a little bit differently,"" he continued.
Kushner said in the past, leaders ""start with a process"" and then hope that process leads to a resolution. Instead, his team is doing the opposite.
""We started on a proposal and then work on a process to try to get there,"" he explained. ""We're not trying to impose our will. I think that the document you'll see which is a very detailed proposal is something we've created by engaging a lot of people from the region and people who have worked on this in the past. I hope that it's a very comprehensive vision for what can be if people are willing to make some hard decisions.""
Kushner said his plan is an effort to improve the lives of Israelis, Palestinians, and the broader region through business.
""Our focus is really on the bottom up. Which is how do you make the lives of the Palestinian people better? What can you resolve to allow these areas to become more investible? We deal with all the core status issues because you have to do it. But we've also wrote up a robust business plan for the whole region,"" he said.
Kushner acknowledged that Israel's biggest concern in the peace process is security, but his proposal calls for compromises on both sides.
""I think that what we do is something that allows for Israel to maintain security but they'll be tough compromises for both,"" he said.
""I'm hopeful that what they'll do is, 'Look there are some compromises here, but at the end of the day this is really a framework that can allow us to make our lives materially better.' And we'll see if the leadership on both sides has the courage to take the leap to try to go forward.""
The peace plan will be released sometime after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan ends, which is the first week of June."
Netanyahu to Name Golan Community After Trump to Honor Historic Declaration,www1.cbn.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/netanyahu-to-name-golan-community-after-trump-to-honor-historic-declaration,"Netanyahu to Name Golan Community After Trump to Honor Historic Declaration 04-24-2019
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will name a Jewish community in the Golan Heights after President Donald Trump in honor of his decision to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the strategic plateau.
Netanyahu made the announcement Tuesday while visiting the Golan.
""All Israelis were deeply moved when President Trump made his historic decision to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights,"" the prime minister says in a video.
""Therefore, after the Passover holiday, I intend to bring to the government a resolution calling for a new community on the Golan Heights named after President Donald J. Trump.""

Trump made history last month by signing a proclamation recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
The decision reversed 52 years of US policy but Trump said it ""should have been done numerous presidents ago.""
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War, but Israel's sovereignty over the area is still not recognized by the international community.
The United Nations Security Council's Resolution 497 declared Israel's decision to control the Golan ""null and void and without international legal effect.""
Israel views the Golan as strategic for fending off Iranian-sponsored terrorists in Syria and Lebanon.
""I am taking historic action to promote Israel's ability to defend itself and have a powerful national security which they're entitled to have,"" Trump said."
Muslim Azerbaijan Model for Co-Existence with Jewish State,www1.cbn.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/muslim-azerbaijan-model-for-co-existence-with-jewish-state,"Muslim Azerbaijan a Model for Co-Existence with Jewish State 04-24-2019 Julie Stahl Credit: CBN News
BAKU - At a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise, one Muslim nation is getting attention for its friendship with Israel and the Jewish people. That country is Azerbaijan. Could it be a model for the rest of the Muslim world?
Azerbaijan sits at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Like Iran, its pre-Islamic days more than 800 years ago, were dominated by the religion of Zoroastrianism.
With a population of nearly 10 million it's the 90th largest country in the world.
It's strategically positioned with Iran on its southern border, Turkey to the west and Russia to the north.
Located on the Caspian Sea, this former Soviet republic is one of the world's major oil producers. The capital Baku is the country's economic center. ""Azerbaijan is a source for about anything between quarter to one-third of the oil import to Israel and this flow of high-quality oil is very important to the State of Israel,"" said Dan Stav, Israel's ambassador to Azerbaijan. Oil isn't the only thing flowing between the two countries. According to Azeri President Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijan has purchased nearly $5 billion worth of weapons systems from Israel. ""This is important for Azerbaijan to maintain its defense and existence in a very challenging strategic environment,"" Stav said. In an interview in the Azeri capital, Baku, Stav told CBN News about his efforts to diversify the economic cooperation between the two countries. ""Israel can be of help, especially in development of the agricultural sector, which is a property of the government and we have cooperation with medical institutes and medical domain in general, education, IT,"" he said. And the relationship goes beyond economy and defense. ""To be an ambassador to Azerbaijan is a special privilege because the relations between the Azeri people preceded the relations with the Jewish state,"" Stav said.
""The Mountainous Jewish community, according to some historical accounts has preceded Islam, Christianity. The first Jews, according to some myth arrived to Azerbaijan after the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 before Christ,"" he added. The vast majority of the population here is Shiite Muslim but it's a secular country. For generations the Jewish community has felt at home here and since its independence, Azerbaijan has had good relations with Israel. In a 2016 visit to Azerbaijan both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Aliyev attested to the deep ties between Jews and Azeris.
""For centuries Jews and Azerbaijanis, lived in peace, friendship, and continue to live here in Azerbaijan and Jewish community in Azerbaijan is a very active part of our society. They contribute a lot to the development of modern Azerbaijan,"" Aliyev said. ""The attitude that you've shown to Jewish people in Azerbaijan over the years, one that has fostered this very strong bond of sympathy and admiration for Azerbaijan -- first of all with the 70,000 Jews who live in Israel, who are from Azerbaijan. It's a human bridge but also something we can show the world,"" Netanyahu said.
""The world sees so much intolerance, so much darkness. Well here is an example of what relations can be and should be between Muslims and Jews everywhere,"" Netanyahu added.
Many Azeri Jews from Israel go back regularly to visit their homeland.
""You don't do it if you come from an environment that (is) infested with anti-Semitism,"" Stav explained. Israel and Azerbaijan have had diplomatic relations since 1992 – after the fall of the Soviet Union. ""We don't consider Muslims as such our enemies and Azerbaijan is itself a proof that this is not the case,"" said Stav. In sharp contrast, Iran is the other Shi'ite Muslim majority country in the neighborhood. ""There's such a startling difference between the two countries. Azerbaijan showed that it's not a matter of Shia,"" Stav added.
Despite years of animosity, Stav said there's a growing understanding among Muslim states in the region.
""Israel is not an enemy and cooperation can be very beneficial,"" he said. ""Azerbaijan serves as an alternative model to the model that we know more – whether it's a Salafi Islam or the political Shia Islam led by Iran and the Hezbollah.""
The hope is that the Azeri-Israeli example of Muslim and Jew standing together will serve as an anchor of stability in the Middle East. "
New Research Proves Alzheimer's Symptoms Can Be Reversed Naturally | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/new-research-proves-alzheimers-symptoms-can-be-reversed-naturally,"New Research Proves Alzheimer's Symptoms Can Be Reversed Naturally
Two big pharmaceutical powerhouses recently threw in the towel on testing their highly-touted Alzheimer's drugs. At the same time, the Journal of the American Medical Association warned against the ""pseudo-medicine"" of Alzheimer's supplements.
Despite those hits, there's still hope for today's Alzheimer's sufferers and those destined to develop it. Newly published research proves 100 patients enjoyed significant, measurable symptom reversal using the protocol developed by Dr. Dale Bredesen, making a huge gain over the initial 19 success stories.
Currently, thousands of people practice Dr. Bredesen's protocol, which he describes in his book, The End of Alzheimer's . The treatment involves being tested for three dozen Alzheimer's risk factors, resulting in an individualized treatment, which includes lifestyle changes like diet and exercise.
On Wednesday's 700 Club, Dr. Bredesen said when a person has Alzheimer's disease, amyloid proteins are present in the brain. He identified three causes of amyloid buildup that leads to Alzheimer's.
""When you produce this amyloid that is present in the brain, this is actually a protective response to several different problems. So, for example, if you have ongoing, systemic inflammation, whether it's from problems with your gut, or problems with an infection such as Lyme Disease, or whether it's because of insulin resistance – a number of factors. Toxin exposure. You're actually making this amyloid as a response. So in fact, when you go to a doctor and the doctor says you have Alzheimer's, but doesn't tell you why you have it. Well, it's because you have the amyloid. Well, why do you have the amyloid? So what we're looking at is why did you get it?"" Bredesen said.
He went on to say there are three things that lead to an amyloid buildup in the brain, which leads to Alzheimer's.
""One is chronic inflammation from infections, leaky gut, poor dentition,"" Bredesen said.
""A second is a decrease in nutrients, hormones, or trophic support. Growth factors in your brain. If you have poor nutrition you are at increased risk. If you have low Vitamin D, you are at increased risk. If various hormones are very low, you cannot support that neural network you have in your brain,"" he went on.
""The third is exposure to toxins, like mercury in tuna fish, or in our dental work, can all contribute. These are all underlying factors. And people typically have more than one – usually between 10 and 25.""
He went on to say that when scientists conduct a trial to find a treatment for a particular disease, they want to look at one thing only. But he says that's not the way this disease works, which is why so many single drug trials for Alzheimer's have failed.
""So the idea of going after something so complex with one drug actually makes no sense,"" Bredesen said.
Instead, he says, maintaining a healthy gut is critical to avoiding Alzheimer's and many other chronic illnesses. Many of us suffer from leaky gut and don't realize it.
""And yet what happens? We get things like Rheumatoid Arthritis, or Lupus or inflammatory gut diseases. And it turns out things like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's can also be related to the inflammation that occurs when your gut leaks. So we should all be tested for it, we should all make sure that we heal,"" Bredesen said.
The best way to prevent inflammatory diseases is through good nutrition.
""The common problems are we tend to eat a diet that is not the diet we ate thousands of years ago,"" Bredesen said.
""We have too much in the way of grains, too much in the way of dairy, and the biggest one of all, simple carbohydrates, sugars. Sugars are in everything, as you know. And these three factors tend to inflame the gut, make it leaky. So the very things you are eating are leaking into your bloodstream. So you don't know it until you develop things like Alzheimer's [and] Arthritis."""
High School History Textbook Labels Trump as Insane and Racist | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/high-school-history-textbook-labels-trump-as-insane-and-racist,"Did High School Textbook Cross Line, Referring to Trump 'Mental Stability' and 'Not Very Hidden Racism'? 04-24-2019 Christian Ellis
High school students are being taught US history from a textbook that focuses on arguments made by Hillary Clinton's supporters, labeling Donald Trump as mentally ill and racist, and his supporters as white and angry. The American history textbook By the People: A History of the United States has a section entitled ""The Angry Election of 2016"" which is critical of the president.
According to The Federalist , the textbook is published by Pearson Education and authored by New York University professor James Fraser, and it started being rolled out to public schools in 2018.
Fox News' Todd Starnes reports one student, Tarra Snyder of Rosemount High School in Minnesota, obtained a copy of the book from her school. She said she was ""appalled"" after seeing the election section and how the textbook ignored the Democratic presidential issues at the time.
""It was really, really surprising to me,"" she said. ""I really believe that learning should be objective and that students can make their own decisions based on what they're able to learn in a classroom, and if the facts are skewed then students aren't able to make well-rounded decisions on what they believe.""
The author wrote in the textbook, ""Most thought that Trump was too extreme a candidate to win the nomination, but his extremism, his anti-establishment rhetoric, and, some said, his not very hidden racism connected with a significant number of primary voters.""
The author went on to state the president's supporters were ""mostly older, often rural or suburban, and overwhelmingly white.""
""Clinton's supporters feared that the election had been determined by people who were afraid of a rapidly developing ethnic diversity of the country, discomfort with their candidate's gender and nostalgia for an earlier time in the nation's history,"" the author continues. ""They also worried about the mental stability of the president-elect and the anger that he and his supporters brought to the nation.""
Scott Overland, a spokesperson for the British-based Pearson Education, told CBN News, ""AP History 'By the People' was developed by an expert author and underwent rigorous peer review to ensure academic integrity... This work is designed to convey college-level information to high school students and meet specific Advanced Placement standards.""
But critics say the book crosses a line.
""In case you didn't think there was an effort going on in public schools to indoctrinate kids with an anti-conservative agenda, a friend of mine took pictures and highlighted parts of this AP US History book,"" tweeted Alex Clark, co-host of The Joe and Alex Show on WNOW in Indianapolis, Ind.

Zahran Hashmi, center, the man Sri Lanka says led the Easter attack that killed over 300 people (AP Photo)
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) - Many of the suicide bombers who killed more than 350 people in a series of coordinated Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka were highly educated and came from well-off families, the junior defense minister said Wednesday. The bombers were breakaway members of a pair of obscure extremist Muslim groups, he said. Officials had earlier blamed one extremist group for the bombings, though they say the attackers may have had support from foreign militants. ""Their thinking is that Islam can be the only religion in this country,"" Ruwan Wijewardene told reporters. ""They are quite well-educated people,"" he said, adding that at least one had a law degree and some may have studied in the UK and Australia. The news came as leaders vowed to overhaul the country's security apparatus after acknowledging that some intelligence units were aware of possible attacks before the Easter bombings. U.S. Ambassador Alaina Teplitz told reporters that ""clearly there was some failure in the system,"" but said the U.S. had no prior knowledge of a threat before the attacks, the worst violence in the South Asian island nation since its civil war ended a decade ago. Teplitz called that breakdown in communication ""incredibly tragic."" Government statements about the attacks have been confused and sometimes contradictory, with police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara telling reporters Wednesday that there were nine suicide bombers - two more than officials said one day earlier. One of the additional suicide bombers was the wife of another bomber, Gunasekara said. The woman, two children and three policemen died in an explosion as authorities closed in on her late Sunday, hours after attacks were launched against three churches and three hotels. The ninth suicide bomber has not been identified, though two more suspects were killed in a later explosion on the outskirts of Colombo. Gunasekara said 60 people have been arrested so far. A team of FBI agents and U.S. military officials were helping in the investigation, Teplitz said. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attacks but authorities remain unsure of their involvement, though many suspect experienced foreign militants were advising, funding or guiding the attackers. Officials say all of the seven main bombers were Sri Lankan. ""We are conducting investigations at the moment to see if there is any direct link to any international organizations,"" Wijewardene said. The Islamic State group's Aamaq news agency released an image it said showed the attackers' leader standing amid seven others with covered faces. It provided no other evidence for its claim. The group, which has lost all the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria, has made a series of unsupported claims of responsibility for various attacks around the world. Sri Lankan authorities had earlier blamed a local extremist group, National Towheed Jamaar, whose leader, alternately named Mohammed Zahran or Zahran Hashmi, became known to Muslim leaders three years ago for his incendiary online speeches. On Wednesday, Wijewardene said the attackers had broken away from National Towheed Jamaar and another group, which he identified only as ""JMI."" Teplitz declined to discuss whether U.S. officials knew about National Towheed Jamaar or its leader before the attack. ""If we had heard something, we would have tried to do something about this,"" Teplitz said. The country has been on heightened alert since the attacks, with police setting off a series of controlled explosions of suspicious objects. No more bombs were found Wednesday. On Tuesday, in an address to Parliament, Wijewardene said ""weakness"" within Sri Lanka's security system had led to the failure to prevent the bombings. ""By now it has been established that the intelligence units were aware of this attack and a group of responsible people were informed about the impending attack,"" Wijewardene said. ""However, this information has been circulated among only a few officials."" In a live address to the nation late Tuesday, President Maithripala Sirisena said he also was kept in the dark on the intelligence about the planned attacks and vowed to ""take stern action"" against officials who failed to share the information. He also pledged ""a complete restructuring"" of the security forces. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Wijewardene also edged away from Tuesday comments that the bombings were retaliation for the March 15 mosque shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed 50 people. He told reporters Wednesday that the mosque attack may have been a motivation for the bombings, but that there was no direct evidence of that. An Australian white supremacist was arrested in the Christchurch shootings. While Sri Lanka's recent history has been rife with ethnic and sectarian conflict, the Easter Sunday attacks came as a shock. Sri Lanka is dominated by Sinhalese Buddhists, but the country of 21 million also has a significant Tamil minority, most of whom are Hindu, Muslim or Christian. Tamil Tiger rebels were known for staging suicide bombings during their 26-year civil war for independence, but religion had little role in that fighting. The Tigers were crushed by the government in 2009. Anti-Muslim bigotry fed by Buddhist nationalists has swept the country since the war ended but Sri Lanka has no history of Islamic militancy. Its small Christian community has seen only scattered incidents of harassment.

'Obviously Very Partisan': Trump Admin Goes on the Offensive Over Congressional Investigations,www1.cbn.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/obviously-very-partisan-trump-admin-goes-on-the-offensive-over-congressional-investigations,"'Obviously Very Partisan': Trump Admin Goes on the Offensive Over Congressional Investigations
The White House is pushing back against congressional investigations, with President Trump saying he is against White House aides testifying to Congress.
The Trump administration is planning to fight in court against a subpoena issued to former White House counsel Don McGahn.
The president told the Washington Post Tuesday, ""There is no reason to go any further, and especially in Congress where it's very partisan, obviously very partisan.""
He went on to say, ""I don't want people testifying to a party, because that is what they're doing if they do this.""
Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters, ""They don't want to get to the truth. They want to get to this president. And at this point, I don't know what Jerry Nadler thinks he's going to get that Robert Mueller didn't, except for some political points with the base.""
Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and others have vowed to move ahead with investigating Trump-related matters ranging from potential obstruction of justice related to the Mueller probe to his personal and business taxes.
The administration also appears to be setting up another fight on that front. The Treasury Department skipped a second deadline to turn over the president's tax returns. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin says he wants to consult on the legal implications of such a move.
On Tuesday's 700 Club, Regent University Law School Dean Mark Martin suggested turning over the taxes would be a terrible precedent. ""I think every American has a lot to fear because if a branch of the federal government can just decide they want to publicly illuminate any of our tax returns, we no longer have any legitimate right of privacy,"" Martin said.
In the meantime, Democrats are divided over whether to pursue impeachment. Several on the campaign trail are calling for impeachment proceedings, but the leadership isn't committing to that path. ""I do believe that impeachment is one of the most divisive forces, paths that we could go down to in our country,"" said Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""But if the path of fact-finding takes us there, we have no choice. But we're not there yet.""
GOP Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham says the Democrats are 'stampeding' to impeachment.
""They're going to use the Mueller report, anything they can find to try to destroy his presidency,"" said Graham. ""Nancy Pelosi is not in charge of the Democratic Party, the radical left is in charge.""
Meanwhile, the president says he's not concerned about being impeached."

But when her Uber driver showed up to take her to her appointment at an abortion clinic an hour away, the student said she could tell he ""seemed uncomfortable.""
After a few minutes of driving, the driver asked her if they were going to an abortion clinic. When the student refused to answer, the driver tried to dissuade her from having an abortion.
He ""proceeded to mention something about his wife being pregnant, how awful the procedure was (and proceeded to explain it in graphic detail), and that 'there is so much they don't tell you,'"" the student explained.
""He then said 'you're going to regret this decision for the rest of your life' and that I was making a mistake.""
The student said it took all her strength ""not to cry"" after hearing his warnings.

""I'm sorry, but I can't take you the rest of the way,"" the student recalled him saying. ""I can take you back to (your city), but you won't be able to find another Uber out here.""
The driver repeatedly offered to take her back home where she can find another Uber driver, but the student declined, called a cab, and had her abortion.

""Within a few days they reached out again and told me the driver had been banned from Uber,"" the woman added.

"Impeachment Fever Is Spreading Along the 2020 Trail, Does Pelosi Have the Cure?",www.cbn.com,Gabe LaMonica,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/democrats-dilemma,"WASHINGTON, DC - Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is shoring up a fragile levee to keep Democrats from jumping on the impeachment bandwagon.
As calls to pursue impeachment in a Democrat-held House spill onto the campaign trail, Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) is pushing fellow Democrats to call for more oversight and more investigation of President Donald Trump.
Republicans in control of the Senate could ultimately shoot down any House attempt to remove the president. Referring to the Russia investigation, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said this week, ""I think the American people would like to move on from this.""
President Trump echoed that sentiment during Monday's White House Easter Egg Roll, sounding nonplussed in his response to a reporter's question as to whether he was worried about impeachment.
""Not even a little bit,"" said the president.
The worry for Democrats is that pursuing impeachment could bring about unintended consequences for the 2020 election.
Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of the presidential frontrunners, acknowledged that fear. During a CNN town hall this week the Vermont Democratic socialist said if ""all that the Congress is talking about is impeaching Trump and Trump, Trump, Trump and Mueller, Mueller, Mueller, what I worry about is that works to Trump's advantage.""
Speaker Pelosi, in an hour-long conference call this week with Democrats – urged caution for that very reason.
""He's not worth it,"" she told her caucus recently.
Presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar agrees. The Minnesota Democrat said ""President Trump should be held accountable,"" but declined to call for impeaching the President.
Still, impeachment fever is spreading along the 2020 trail.
Democratic candidate Sen. Kamala Harris joined the fray.
""I believe this President and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice, I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment,"" she said at that same town hall.
The California senator joined voices with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the first of the 2020 Democrats to call for impeachment.
""There is no political inconvenience exception to the US Constitution,"" said Warren.
As for a subpoena by Democrats to provide Congress with a fully un-redacted Mueller report, a Republican privy to the less-redacted version given to some members of Congress called that move unnecessary.
""There was nothing there,"" said Georgia's Doug Collins after looking at a special version of the special counsel's text.
Congressman Collins called upon Democrats to look for themselves.
""To not come here and take advantage of the Attorney General and his offer, to me, says they are not worried about what is in the report,"" said Collins, referring to Democratic members of Congress who have not looked at the less-redacted version. ""They are more worried about actually scoring political points.""
On CBN's ""Faith Nation"" Tuesday, Republican political strategist John Brabender claimed that nothing in the Mueller Report constitutes an impeachable offense.
""What they're basically saying is, 'OK, the president wasn't guilty of obstruction but, A-ha he was guilty of trying to stop the very investigation that proved he wasn't guilty of collusion,'"" said Brabender. ""It makes absolutely no sense.""
As more Democratic presidential candidates join the calls for impeachment, the rift is sure to grow deeper as candidates continue on their way down the trail to 2020."

""They also worried about the mental stability of the president-elect and the anger that he and his supporters brought to the nation.""
Scott Overland, a spokesperson for the British-based Pearson Education, told CBN News, ""AP History 'By the People' was developed by an expert author and underwent rigorous peer review to ensure academic integrity... This work is designed to convey college-level information to high school students and meet specific Advanced Placement standards.""
But critics say the book crosses a line.
""In case you didn't think there was an effort going on in public schools to indoctrinate kids with an anti-conservative agenda, a friend of mine took pictures and highlighted parts of this AP US History book,"" tweeted Alex Clark, co-host of The Joe and Alex Show on WNOW in Indianapolis, Ind.

'Obviously Very Partisan': Trump Admin Goes on the Offensive Over Congressional Investigations,www.cbn.com,Charlene Aaron,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/obviously-very-partisan-trump-admin-goes-on-the-offensive-over-congressional-investigations,"The White House is pushing back against congressional investigations, with President Trump saying he is against White House aides testifying to Congress.
The Trump administration is planning to fight in court against a subpoena issued to former White House counsel Don McGahn.
The president told the Washington Post Tuesday, ""There is no reason to go any further, and especially in Congress where it's very partisan, obviously very partisan.""
He went on to say, ""I don't want people testifying to a party, because that is what they're doing if they do this.""
Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters, ""They don't want to get to the truth. They want to get to this president. And at this point, I don't know what Jerry Nadler thinks he's going to get that Robert Mueller didn't, except for some political points with the base.""
Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and others have vowed to move ahead with investigating Trump-related matters ranging from potential obstruction of justice related to the Mueller probe to his personal and business taxes.
The administration also appears to be setting up another fight on that front. The Treasury Department skipped a second deadline to turn over the president's tax returns. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin says he wants to consult on the legal implications of such a move.
On Tuesday's 700 Club, Regent University Law School Dean Mark Martin suggested turning over the taxes would be a terrible precedent.
""I think every American has a lot to fear because if a branch of the federal government can just decide they want to publicly illuminate any of our tax returns, we no longer have any legitimate right of privacy,"" Martin said.
In the meantime, Democrats are divided over whether to pursue impeachment. Several on the campaign trail are calling for impeachment proceedings, but the leadership isn't committing to that path.
""I do believe that impeachment is one of the most divisive forces, paths that we could go down to in our country,"" said Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""But if the path of fact-finding takes us there, we have no choice. But we're not there yet.""
GOP Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham says the Democrats are 'stampeding' to impeachment.
""They're going to use the Mueller report, anything they can find to try to destroy his presidency,"" said Graham. ""Nancy Pelosi is not in charge of the Democratic Party, the radical left is in charge.""
Meanwhile, the president says he's not concerned about being impeached."
"Sri Lanka Terrorists Believed 'Islam Can Be the Only Religion', Most Were Highly Educated",www.cbn.com,Associated Press,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/sri-lanka-terrorists-believed-islam-can-be-the-only-religion-most-were-highly-educated,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) - Many of the suicide bombers who killed more than 350 people in a series of coordinated Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka were highly educated and came from well-off families, the junior defense minister said Wednesday.
The bombers were breakaway members of a pair of obscure extremist Muslim groups, he said. Officials had earlier blamed one extremist group for the bombings, though they say the attackers may have had support from foreign militants.
""Their thinking is that Islam can be the only religion in this country,"" Ruwan Wijewardene told reporters. ""They are quite well-educated people,"" he said, adding that at least one had a law degree and some may have studied in the UK and Australia.
The news came as leaders vowed to overhaul the country's security apparatus after acknowledging that some intelligence units were aware of possible attacks before the Easter bombings.
U.S. Ambassador Alaina Teplitz told reporters that ""clearly there was some failure in the system,"" but said the U.S. had no prior knowledge of a threat before the attacks, the worst violence in the South Asian island nation since its civil war ended a decade ago.
Teplitz called that breakdown in communication ""incredibly tragic.""
Government statements about the attacks have been confused and sometimes contradictory, with police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara telling reporters Wednesday that there were nine suicide bombers - two more than officials said one day earlier.
One of the additional suicide bombers was the wife of another bomber, Gunasekara said. The woman, two children and three policemen died in an explosion as authorities closed in on her late Sunday, hours after attacks were launched against three churches and three hotels. The ninth suicide bomber has not been identified, though two more suspects were killed in a later explosion on the outskirts of Colombo.
Gunasekara said 60 people have been arrested so far. A team of FBI agents and U.S. military officials were helping in the investigation, Teplitz said.
The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attacks but authorities remain unsure of their involvement, though many suspect experienced foreign militants were advising, funding or guiding the attackers. Officials say all of the seven main bombers were Sri Lankan.
""We are conducting investigations at the moment to see if there is any direct link to any international organizations,"" Wijewardene said.
The Islamic State group's Aamaq news agency released an image it said showed the attackers' leader standing amid seven others with covered faces. It provided no other evidence for its claim.
The group, which has lost all the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria, has made a series of unsupported claims of responsibility for various attacks around the world.
Sri Lankan authorities had earlier blamed a local extremist group, National Towheed Jamaar, whose leader, alternately named Mohammed Zahran or Zahran Hashmi, became known to Muslim leaders three years ago for his incendiary online speeches. On Wednesday, Wijewardene said the attackers had broken away from National Towheed Jamaar and another group, which he identified only as ""JMI.""
Teplitz declined to discuss whether U.S. officials knew about National Towheed Jamaar or its leader before the attack. ""If we had heard something, we would have tried to do something about this,"" Teplitz said.
The country has been on heightened alert since the attacks, with police setting off a series of controlled explosions of suspicious objects. No more bombs were found Wednesday.
On Tuesday, in an address to Parliament, Wijewardene said ""weakness"" within Sri Lanka's security system had led to the failure to prevent the bombings.
""By now it has been established that the intelligence units were aware of this attack and a group of responsible people were informed about the impending attack,"" Wijewardene said. ""However, this information has been circulated among only a few officials.""
In a live address to the nation late Tuesday, President Maithripala Sirisena said he also was kept in the dark on the intelligence about the planned attacks and vowed to ""take stern action"" against officials who failed to share the information. He also pledged ""a complete restructuring"" of the security forces.
Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Wijewardene also edged away from Tuesday comments that the bombings were retaliation for the March 15 mosque shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed 50 people. He told reporters Wednesday that the mosque attack may have been a motivation for the bombings, but that there was no direct evidence of that.
An Australian white supremacist was arrested in the Christchurch shootings.
While Sri Lanka's recent history has been rife with ethnic and sectarian conflict, the Easter Sunday attacks came as a shock.
Sri Lanka is dominated by Sinhalese Buddhists, but the country of 21 million also has a significant Tamil minority, most of whom are Hindu, Muslim or Christian.
Tamil Tiger rebels were known for staging suicide bombings during their 26-year civil war for independence, but religion had little role in that fighting. The Tigers were crushed by the government in 2009. Anti-Muslim bigotry fed by Buddhist nationalists has swept the country since the war ended but Sri Lanka has no history of Islamic militancy. Its small Christian community has seen only scattered incidents of harassment.

Kushner: Israeli-Palestinian Peace Plan Will Require 'Tough Compromises' for Both Sides,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/kushner-israeli-palestinian-peace-plan-will-require-tough-compromises-for-both-sides,"President Donald Trump's Senior Advisor Jared Kushner shed light Tuesday on the Trump administration's highly-anticipated ""Deal of the Century"" peace-plan that will be presented to Israelis and Palestinians in the coming weeks.
Kushner, who has been tasked with overseeing the proposal process, said his team is taking a different approach than previous attempts to end the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
""I mean it's about as tough of a problem set as you can get and so I think we've taken I think an unconventional approach,"" he said during an interview at the 2019 TIME 100 Summit.
""We've studied, you know, all the different past efforts and how they've failed and why they've failed. And there's been some tremendous work done by the people who worked on this before us. So, we've tried to do it a little bit differently,"" he continued.
Kushner said in the past, leaders ""start with a process"" and then hope that process leads to a resolution. Instead, his team is doing the opposite.
""We started on a proposal and then work on a process to try to get there,"" he explained. ""We're not trying to impose our will. I think that the document you'll see which is a very detailed proposal is something we've created by engaging a lot of people from the region and people who have worked on this in the past. I hope that it's a very comprehensive vision for what can be if people are willing to make some hard decisions.""
Kushner said his plan is an effort to improve the lives of Israelis, Palestinians, and the broader region through business.
""Our focus is really on the bottom up. Which is how do you make the lives of the Palestinian people better? What can you resolve to allow these areas to become more investible? We deal with all the core status issues because you have to do it. But we've also wrote up a robust business plan for the whole region,"" he said.
Kushner acknowledged that Israel's biggest concern in the peace process is security, but his proposal calls for compromises on both sides.
""I think that what we do is something that allows for Israel to maintain security but they'll be tough compromises for both,"" he said.
""I'm hopeful that what they'll do is, 'Look there are some compromises here, but at the end of the day this is really a framework that can allow us to make our lives materially better.' And we'll see if the leadership on both sides has the courage to take the leap to try to go forward.""
The peace plan will be released sometime after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan ends, which is the first week of June."
Netanyahu to Name Golan Community After Trump to Honor Historic Declaration,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/netanyahu-to-name-golan-community-after-trump-to-honor-historic-declaration,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will name a Jewish community in the Golan Heights after President Donald Trump in honor of his decision to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the strategic plateau.
Netanyahu made the announcement Tuesday while visiting the Golan.
""All Israelis were deeply moved when President Trump made his historic decision to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights,"" the prime minister says in a video.
""Therefore, after the Passover holiday, I intend to bring to the government a resolution calling for a new community on the Golan Heights named after President Donald J. Trump.""

Trump made history last month by signing a proclamation recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
The decision reversed 52 years of US policy but Trump said it ""should have been done numerous presidents ago.""
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War, but Israel's sovereignty over the area is still not recognized by the international community.
The United Nations Security Council's Resolution 497 declared Israel's decision to control the Golan ""null and void and without international legal effect.""
Israel views the Golan as strategic for fending off Iranian-sponsored terrorists in Syria and Lebanon.
""I am taking historic action to promote Israel's ability to defend itself and have a powerful national security which they're entitled to have,"" Trump said."
Muslim Azerbaijan a Model for Co-Existence with Jewish State,www.cbn.com,Julie Stahl,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/muslim-azerbaijan-model-for-co-existence-with-jewish-state,"BAKU - At a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise, one Muslim nation is getting attention for its friendship with Israel and the Jewish people. That country is Azerbaijan. Could it be a model for the rest of the Muslim world?
Azerbaijan sits at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Like Iran, its pre-Islamic days more than 800 years ago, were dominated by the religion of Zoroastrianism.
With a population of nearly 10 million it's the 90th largest country in the world.
It's strategically positioned with Iran on its southern border, Turkey to the west and Russia to the north.
Located on the Caspian Sea, this former Soviet republic is one of the world's major oil producers. The capital Baku is the country's economic center.
""Azerbaijan is a source for about anything between quarter to one-third of the oil import to Israel and this flow of high-quality oil is very important to the State of Israel,"" said Dan Stav, Israel's ambassador to Azerbaijan.
Oil isn't the only thing flowing between the two countries. According to Azeri President Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijan has purchased nearly $5 billion worth of weapons systems from Israel.
""This is important for Azerbaijan to maintain its defense and existence in a very challenging strategic environment,"" Stav said.
In an interview in the Azeri capital, Baku, Stav told CBN News about his efforts to diversify the economic cooperation between the two countries.
""Israel can be of help, especially in development of the agricultural sector, which is a property of the government and we have cooperation with medical institutes and medical domain in general, education, IT,"" he said.
And the relationship goes beyond economy and defense.
""To be an ambassador to Azerbaijan is a special privilege because the relations between the Azeri people preceded the relations with the Jewish state,"" Stav said.
""The Mountainous Jewish community, according to some historical accounts has preceded Islam, Christianity. The first Jews, according to some myth arrived to Azerbaijan after the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 before Christ,"" he added.
The vast majority of the population here is Shiite Muslim but it's a secular country. For generations the Jewish community has felt at home here and since its independence, Azerbaijan has had good relations with Israel.
In a 2016 visit to Azerbaijan both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Aliyev attested to the deep ties between Jews and Azeris.
""For centuries Jews and Azerbaijanis, lived in peace, friendship, and continue to live here in Azerbaijan and Jewish community in Azerbaijan is a very active part of our society. They contribute a lot to the development of modern Azerbaijan,"" Aliyev said.
""The attitude that you've shown to Jewish people in Azerbaijan over the years, one that has fostered this very strong bond of sympathy and admiration for Azerbaijan -- first of all with the 70,000 Jews who live in Israel, who are from Azerbaijan. It's a human bridge but also something we can show the world,"" Netanyahu said.
""The world sees so much intolerance, so much darkness. Well here is an example of what relations can be and should be between Muslims and Jews everywhere,"" Netanyahu added.
Many Azeri Jews from Israel go back regularly to visit their homeland.
""You don't do it if you come from an environment that (is) infested with anti-Semitism,"" Stav explained.
Israel and Azerbaijan have had diplomatic relations since 1992 – after the fall of the Soviet Union.
""We don't consider Muslims as such our enemies and Azerbaijan is itself a proof that this is not the case,"" said Stav.
In sharp contrast, Iran is the other Shi'ite Muslim majority country in the neighborhood.
""There's such a startling difference between the two countries. Azerbaijan showed that it's not a matter of Shia,"" Stav added.
Despite years of animosity, Stav said there's a growing understanding among Muslim states in the region.
""Israel is not an enemy and cooperation can be very beneficial,"" he said. ""Azerbaijan serves as an alternative model to the model that we know more – whether it's a Salafi Islam or the political Shia Islam led by Iran and the Hezbollah.""
The hope is that the Azeri-Israeli example of Muslim and Jew standing together will serve as an anchor of stability in the Middle East."
New Research Proves Alzheimer's Symptoms Can Be Reversed Naturally,www.cbn.com,CBN News,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/new-research-proves-alzheimers-symptoms-can-be-reversed-naturally,"Two big pharmaceutical powerhouses recently threw in the towel on testing their highly-touted Alzheimer's drugs. At the same time, the Journal of the American Medical Association warned against the ""pseudo-medicine"" of Alzheimer's supplements.
Despite those hits, there's still hope for today's Alzheimer's sufferers and those destined to develop it. Newly published research proves 100 patients enjoyed significant, measurable symptom reversal using the protocol developed by Dr. Dale Bredesen, making a huge gain over the initial 19 success stories.
Currently, thousands of people practice Dr. Bredesen's protocol, which he describes in his book, The End of Alzheimer's . The treatment involves being tested for three dozen Alzheimer's risk factors, resulting in an individualized treatment, which includes lifestyle changes like diet and exercise.
On Wednesday's 700 Club, Dr. Bredesen said when a person has Alzheimer's disease, amyloid proteins are present in the brain. He identified three causes of amyloid buildup that leads to Alzheimer's.
""When you produce this amyloid that is present in the brain, this is actually a protective response to several different problems. So, for example, if you have ongoing, systemic inflammation, whether it's from problems with your gut, or problems with an infection such as Lyme Disease, or whether it's because of insulin resistance – a number of factors. Toxin exposure. You're actually making this amyloid as a response. So in fact, when you go to a doctor and the doctor says you have Alzheimer's, but doesn't tell you why you have it. Well, it's because you have the amyloid. Well, why do you have the amyloid? So what we're looking at is why did you get it?"" Bredesen said.
He went on to say there are three things that lead to an amyloid buildup in the brain, which leads to Alzheimer's.
""One is chronic inflammation from infections, leaky gut, poor dentition,"" Bredesen said.
""A second is a decrease in nutrients, hormones, or trophic support. Growth factors in your brain. If you have poor nutrition you are at increased risk. If you have low Vitamin D, you are at increased risk. If various hormones are very low, you cannot support that neural network you have in your brain,"" he went on.
""The third is exposure to toxins, like mercury in tuna fish, or in our dental work, can all contribute. These are all underlying factors. And people typically have more than one – usually between 10 and 25.""
He went on to say that when scientists conduct a trial to find a treatment for a particular disease, they want to look at one thing only. But he says that's not the way this disease works, which is why so many single drug trials for Alzheimer's have failed.
""So the idea of going after something so complex with one drug actually makes no sense,"" Bredesen said.
Instead, he says, maintaining a healthy gut is critical to avoiding Alzheimer's and many other chronic illnesses. Many of us suffer from leaky gut and don't realize it.
""And yet what happens? We get things like Rheumatoid Arthritis, or Lupus or inflammatory gut diseases. And it turns out things like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's can also be related to the inflammation that occurs when your gut leaks. So we should all be tested for it, we should all make sure that we heal,"" Bredesen said.
The best way to prevent inflammatory diseases is through good nutrition.
""The common problems are we tend to eat a diet that is not the diet we ate thousands of years ago,"" Bredesen said.
""We have too much in the way of grains, too much in the way of dairy, and the biggest one of all, simple carbohydrates, sugars. Sugars are in everything, as you know. And these three factors tend to inflame the gut, make it leaky. So the very things you are eating are leaking into your bloodstream. So you don't know it until you develop things like Alzheimer's [and] Arthritis."""

"Impeachment Fever Is Spreading Along the 2020 Trail, Does Pelosi Have the Cure?",www1.cbn.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/impeachment-fever-is-spreading-along-the-2020-trail-does-pelosi-have-the-cure,"Impeachment Fever Is Spreading Along the 2020 Trail, Does Pelosi Have the Cure?
WASHINGTON, DC - Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is shoring up a fragile levee to keep Democrats from jumping on the impeachment bandwagon.
As calls to pursue impeachment in a Democrat-held House spill onto the campaign trail, Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) is pushing fellow Democrats to call for more oversight and more investigation of President Donald Trump.
Republicans in control of the Senate could ultimately shoot down any House attempt to remove the president. Referring to the Russia investigation, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said this week, ""I think the American people would like to move on from this.""
President Trump echoed that sentiment during Monday's White House Easter Egg Roll, sounding nonplussed in his response to a reporter's question as to whether he was worried about impeachment.
""Not even a little bit,"" said the president.
The worry for Democrats is that pursuing impeachment could bring about unintended consequences for the 2020 election.
Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of the presidential frontrunners, acknowledged that fear. During a CNN town hall this week the Vermont Democratic socialist said if ""all that the Congress is talking about is impeaching Trump and Trump, Trump, Trump and Mueller, Mueller, Mueller, what I worry about is that works to Trump's advantage.""
Speaker Pelosi, in an hour-long conference call this week with Democrats – urged caution for that very reason.
""He's not worth it,"" she told her caucus recently.
Presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar agrees. The Minnesota Democrat said ""President Trump should be held accountable,"" but declined to call for impeaching the President.
Still, impeachment fever is spreading along the 2020 trail.
Democratic candidate Sen. Kamala Harris joined the fray.
""I believe this President and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice, I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment,"" she said at that same town hall.
The California senator joined voices with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the first of the 2020 Democrats to call for impeachment.
""There is no political inconvenience exception to the US Constitution,"" said Warren.
As for a subpoena by Democrats to provide Congress with a fully un-redacted Mueller report, a Republican privy to the less-redacted version given to some members of Congress called that move unnecessary.
""There was nothing there,"" said Georgia's Doug Collins after looking at a special version of the special counsel's text.
Congressman Collins called upon Democrats to look for themselves.
""To not come here and take advantage of the Attorney General and his offer, to me, says they are not worried about what is in the report,"" said Collins, referring to Democratic members of Congress who have not looked at the less-redacted version. ""They are more worried about actually scoring political points.""
On CBN's ""Faith Nation"" Tuesday, Republican political strategist John Brabender claimed that nothing in the Mueller Report constitutes an impeachable offense.
""What they're basically saying is, 'OK, the president wasn't guilty of obstruction but, A-ha he was guilty of trying to stop the very investigation that proved he wasn't guilty of collusion,'"" said Brabender. ""It makes absolutely no sense.""
As more Democratic presidential candidates join the calls for impeachment, the rift is sure to grow deeper as candidates continue on their way down the trail to 2020."

'We'll See You at the Supreme Court!' How Ohio's Heartbeat Bill Threatens Roe,www1.cbn.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/well-see-you-at-the-supreme-court-how-ohios-heartbeat-bill-threatens-roe,"'We'll See You at the Supreme Court!' How Ohio's Heartbeat Bill Threatens Roe 04-24-2019 Baby in the womb (Photo: Adobe Stock)
ANALYSIS
This month may have seen the initial judicial step in overturning the landmark abortion case, Roe v. Wade.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has signed into state law one of the most restrictive pro-life bills in the United States: SB 23, otherwise known as the ""heartbeat bill.""
Inside the Heartbeat Bill
SB 23 prohibits abortions if a heartbeat is detected, which according to the American Pregnancy Association (APA) starts between 5 ½ to 6 ½ weeks. APA also reports that most women discover they're pregnant at 5-7 weeks development. That said, many women don't know they're pregnant until after a baby's heartbeat begins and thus many women who would have otherwise chosen abortion will be prohibited from doing so.
The bill does allow for an exception if the mother's life is at risk, but not for circumstances of rape or incest.
The bill also requires that women who seek but cannot attain an abortion are counseled on adoption options.
Chairman of the Ohio House Health Committee, Rep. Derek Merrin, told CBN News that he acknowledged the threat that this bill has to the Roe decision. ""This bill was constructed to save lives, and with the standard we've set, we certainly expect the Roe decision to be challenged.""
Jena Powell, representative for Ohio's 80th district, praised the passing of the law and told CBN News, ""This is a big day for the people of Ohio and ultimately the United States. Democrats are scared. They can see the threat this bill has on Roe v. Wade and they are scared.""
How Could Ohio's Heartbeat Bill Lead to the Overturn of Roe v. Wade?
A leading component to the Roe decision was the balancing act between a woman's right to privacy and the life potentiality of the fetus. Thus, any chance to overturn Roe must involve similar components. Ohio's heartbeat bill does just that, and such language could easily initiate a revisit to the Roe decision.
Speaking with CBN News, Professor of political science at Biola University, Dr. Scott Waller, weighed in.
""The heartbeat bill seems, on its face, to challenge the idea that the developing fetus is only a potential life until it becomes viable at some point during the third trimester. If the courts determine that the presence of a heartbeat denotes the presence of an actual life (i.e., a real life separate and distinct from the mother) then this life would enjoy the protections of the 14th Amendment as even the Court admitted in Roe,"" Waller said.
In order for the Supreme Court to consider an overturn to Roe, the heartbeat bill must first be challenged. Such a challenge has already been promised by the ACLU, enlisting the pro-choice group Preterm-Cleveland as their Plaintiff. Planned Parenthood is also joining the ranks of legal opposition.
""We'll see you at the Supreme Court!"" said Iris Harvey, president of Planned Parenthood of Ohio.
The lawsuit is both expected and welcomed by Ohio state legislators.
""Will there be a lawsuit? Yeah, we are counting on it…We're excited about it,"" said Ohio state Rep. Ron Hood.
Clearly, a legal battle is looming – one that both sides are ready and willing to take to the highest court in the land.
Legal Director for the ACLU of Ohio, Freda Levenson, told CBN News she expects the law to be struck down. ""The so-called heartbeat bill is a clear violation of the precedent set forth in Roe. The jurists on the courts, regardless of their philosophy, have a duty to the Constitution which has already upheld Roe.""
While some pro-life policy-pushers have suggested the heartbeat bill was specifically drafted to overturn Roe, other pro-life activists see the potential overturn as a convenient result, but not necessarily the target idea.
President of Citizens for Community Values Aaron Baer told us, ""While the heartbeat bill was not specifically drafted to overturn Roe v. Wade, it was drafted to be Constitutional. An overturn to Roe v. Wade would simply be a result of the constitutional integrity of the heartbeat bill.""
What Would the Sequence of Court Decisions Look Like?
The ACLU of Ohio confirmed to CBN News that they will be filing in federal court. This would start in the Ohio District Court, followed by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, and then the United States Supreme Court. This is supposing all courts agree to review the case.
6th Circuit Court of Appeals
With President Trump following through on his campaign promise to appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court, the reality of a landmark overturn has become more viable.
It is important to note that in addition to SCOTUS appointees, Trump has appointed 95 judges to the lower federal courts, 37 of whom are on circuit courts. The Supreme Court is presented with approximately 7,000 cases a year and selects approximately 250 to review. Thus, circuit courts often set the precedent for their jurisdiction with no hierarchal influence.
The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals holds a heavy conservative leaning, with 11 of the 16 active judges reputably more conservative. Six of them are Trump appointees.
US Supreme Court Makeup
The appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch, while a victory for conservatives, did not change the jurisprudential demographics of the Court. Gorsuch's appointment prolonged the conservative influence of the late Justice Antonin Scalia but did not increase or decrease the Court's conservative influence.
However, the appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the high Court may change the jurisprudential demographics, since his predecessor, Justice Anthony Kennedy, historically ruled against the pro-life agenda. Kennedy was a key player in the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey which effectively upheld Roe with little change.
But the current demographics of the Supreme Court are only so relative to the Ohio heartbeat bill, since the appellate process can take between 4-6 years. Two of the Court's liberal justices are also the two oldest: Justices Breyer at 80 and Ginsburg at 86. By the time the heartbeat bill makes its way to the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg may have retired, if not also Breyer.
If Trump's history of SCOTUS appointees remains consistent, and assuming his reelection, the conservative majority on the Court could shift from 5-4 to 6-3 or even 7-2 if both of the Court's eldest justices retire by the time this case makes its way to the high court. If Trump is not reelected, the Court's shift may fall towards a liberal influence."
What Would Happen if the Earth's Magnetic Poles Flipped?,www1.cbn.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/what-would-happen-if-the-earths-magnetic-poles-flipped,"What Would Happen if the Earth's Magnetic Poles Flipped? 04-24-2019 Dale Hurd
The Earth's north magnetic pole has been moving from its old location in Northern Canada towards Siberia. And there is a growing concern among scientists that the weakening of the Earth's magnetic field could someday cause its north and south poles to flip. And that could lead to global chaos.
The Earth's magnetic north has been moving ever since it was first discovered in 1831. It's driven by molten iron moving deep beneath the Earth's crust. But magnetic north is now moving so quickly that it forced the world's geomagnetism experts to update the World Magnetic Model a year early. Dr. Hugh Ross, an astronomer and founder of Reasons to Believe , talks with Pat Robertson about what will happen if the Earth's magnetic poles flip on Thursday's 700 Club.
That model is the basis for modern navigation, for ships and planes, satellites and smartphones, and it helps birds and other animals to navigate as well.
If Earth's magnetic field were to decay significantly, scientists say it could collapse altogether and flip polarity – changing magnetic north to south and south to north. The planet's magnetic poles are believed to have flipped before in earth history, but never in a time with such a dependence on technology. And many scientists now say a flip of north and south is looking more and more certain."
Gender 'X': Nevada Allows Non-Binary Option for Driver's License and ID'S,www1.cbn.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/gender-x-nevada-allows-non-binary-option-for-drivers-license-and-ids,"Gender 'X': Nevada Allows Non-Binary Option for Driver's License and ID'S 04-24-2019 Christian Ellis (Photo: Adobe Stock)
People in Nevada can now get a driver's license or ID card with an ""X"" for their gender instead of ""M"" for male or ""F"" for female.
The Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles started giving that option Monday in a ""final step in a years-long effort to modernize policies toward transgender residents and those who don't identify with either sex.""
""The DMV is committed to being inclusive and realizes some people don't want to be forced to identify as either male or female,"" said DMV Director Julie Butler. ""We would like to thank the Nevada community groups who brought these issues to our attention and worked with us to bring about the changes.""
The new change comes after Nevada's Department of Health and Human Services changed its rules in 2016 to allow people to change their genders on birth certificates. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported the DMV changed its regulations last year to allow applicants to self-certify the gender on their ID with no further documentation required.
Nevada is the 10th state or region to offer a gender-neutral designation on IDs. Other states include Arkansas, California, the District of Columbia, Minnesota, Oregon, Colorado, Indiana, Maine and Vermont. Maryland is expected to make the change later this year.
Before the change, Nevada's DMV sent out a memo requiring all employees to follow the new policy.
""It is not the responsibility of the DMV to question an applicant's gender choice,"" it states. ""As we all know, we cannot assume a person's gender based on a person's appearance."""

The attorney general of Montana has invited Chick-fil-A to open more restaurants in his state after two other states have taken actions to block the food chain over its biblical values.
With Chick-fil-A under fire, Montana Republican Tim Fox wrote, ""Politicians in some states may think it's okay to discriminate against others based on their religious views. That's not how we do things in Montana.""
Chick-fil-A currently has only one restaurant in Montana.
Fox is running for governor next year. His comments came after the city council in San Antonio, Texas voted late last week against reconsidering its decision to block the restaurant from its contract at the city's airport.
Most recently, Chick-fil-A came under fire for making charitable donations to organizations with Christian beliefs like Salvation Army and Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Liberals claim that's proof that Chick-fil-A is anti-gay, even though none of those organizations is anti-gay.
""While some have questioned the motives behind our donations, we want to take a moment to reiterate the mission and focus of the Chick-fil-A Foundation, which has always been and always will be to donate to programs that support a diverse array of youth and educational programs nationwide,"" the company responded in a statement.

A Second Chance for Trafficking Survivors: Advocates Work to Clear Their Records,www1.cbn.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/a-second-chance-for-trafficking-survivors-advocates-work-to-clear-their-records,"A Second Chance for Trafficking Survivors: Advocates Work to Clear Their Records 04-24-2019 Heather Sells
When victims of trafficking escape from their traffickers, they typically carry with them a criminal record that includes arrests and charges for crimes that took place while they were forced to provide commercial sex.
In 2016, the National Survivor Network surveyed 130 trafficking survivors and found that 90 percent reported having been arrested. Forty percent said they were arrested 9 times or more. More than half said they were first trafficked as children.
These criminal records can include prostitution charges from police that didn't understand their situation or arrests for thefts that their traffickers demanded using coercion and control tactics.
Going forward, the records stand in the way of employment. Many licensed professions, or jobs that involve health care or working with children, are unavailable to anyone with a criminal background.
The records can also land survivors in trouble with landlords who won't rent to them, colleges that are hesitant to admit them, and they can create havoc in future legal cases like child custody disputes.
""I've had clients turned down from dog walking jobs,"" says Jamie Quient, the president of Free to Thrive.
The San Diego-based non-profit provides free legal services to trafficking survivors in southern California and Quient says she has watched for years as survivors she's worked with have struggled to move beyond their pasts.
The problem: even sealing or expunging criminal records is often not enough to help victims overcome their hurdles.
""If you expunge your record it actually still shows up when an employer or anybody else runs a background check,"" says Quient. Another problem: survivors still have to affirm when asked whether or not they've been arrested or charged with a crime.
It's why Quient and other trafficking advocates support a new legal tool known as vacatur.
The first vacatur law was implemented in 2010 in New York and provides a true second chance for trafficking survivors say advocates.
""The vacatur law is a finding of factual innocence,"" says Quient, ""it's as if it never happened and they actually have to destroy the records completely so it's a completely clean slate for victims and survivors of human trafficking.""
Quient just secured the first vacatur for a trafficking survivor in Orange County, California.
The woman, who was forced into trafficking at age 16, can now enjoy a clean record and can lawfully deny or even refuse to acknowledge any arrest or conviction.
In order to meet the California law's criteria , her judge found that she was a trafficking victim during the time that the crimes were committed, that she has demonstrated a good faith effort to remove herself from trafficking, and that it's in her best interest and the best interest of justice to ""vacate,"" seal, and destroy her criminal records.
The clean slate also allows victims to identify themselves in a new light, says Quient. ""This fresh start is saying to her – she's not a criminal and she never should have been treated like a criminal to begin with,"" she explained.
Shared Hope International tracks legal developments that help trafficking survivors in all 50 states. In 2017 it reported that 35 states have some kind of vacatur law that could apply to human trafficking victims.
It also noted that 49 states and Washington, DC allow for the expunging or sealing of juvenile delinquency records."

Wallace and Christine are a father/daughter team at a successful financial planning firm in Tampa, Florida. Both enjoy being partners at the firm.
“Seeing the clients at different stages of their lives and helping them through some of the choices that they need to make. We know we did our job and we took care of them and they’re thankful. It’s just a very rewarding profession,” says Christine.
Christine is married with a family of her own now. But as a child, she remembers learning important lessons from her parents, including about tithing and giving. She noticed when they shared stories that she couldn’t explain as a coincidence. Like the time her father pledged to give $1000 that he didn’t have.
Wallace says, “About two weeks later, I received a commission on an investment that I was unaware the gentleman was going to invest in that way. And it came out that I had a commission of approximately $1000. So, it was returned! The more we are blessed, the more we can give. And it's more joyful to give than to receive.”
One of the places where Wallace and Christine give is CBN.
Christine says, “It’s phenomenal that they have the Well Project. It’s just a wonderful gift to those communities that are very remote.”
Wallace adds, “Operation Blessing is always there. The trucks roll and people are helped.”
“Helping the Home Front is a phenomenal new program with CBN. To work with these military families and encourage their faith!” says Christine.
“Superbook, I am very impressed with the spreading of the gospel throughout the world,” says Wallace.
“Orphan's Promise is doing a beautiful job of helping these orphans that otherwise would be left and instead, now they're chosen,” says Christine.
This father/daughter team plans on continuing to give to CBN for a long time to come.
Christine says, “The gift is in the giving. The gift is for the giver. It's not about the organization that's asking for the funds. It's about doing the right thing that the Lord has put on your heart to do. It’s important to open your mind and open your pocketbook and let the Lord in, because He's an amazing God.” Show Guest Bio:"

'We'll See You at the Supreme Court!' How Ohio's Heartbeat Bill Threatens Roe,www.cbn.com,John Wesley Reid,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/well-see-you-at-the-supreme-court-how-ohios-heartbeat-bill-threatens-roe,"ANALYSIS
This month may have seen the initial judicial step in overturning the landmark abortion case, Roe v. Wade.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has signed into state law one of the most restrictive pro-life bills in the United States: SB 23, otherwise known as the ""heartbeat bill.""
Inside the Heartbeat Bill
SB 23 prohibits abortions if a heartbeat is detected, which according to the American Pregnancy Association (APA) starts between 5 ½ to 6 ½ weeks. APA also reports that most women discover they're pregnant at 5-7 weeks development. That said, many women don't know they're pregnant until after a baby's heartbeat begins and thus many women who would have otherwise chosen abortion will be prohibited from doing so.
The bill does allow for an exception if the mother's life is at risk, but not for circumstances of rape or incest.
The bill also requires that women who seek but cannot attain an abortion are counseled on adoption options.
Chairman of the Ohio House Health Committee, Rep. Derek Merrin, told CBN News that he acknowledged the threat that this bill has to the Roe decision. ""This bill was constructed to save lives, and with the standard we've set, we certainly expect the Roe decision to be challenged.""
Jena Powell, representative for Ohio's 80th district, praised the passing of the law and told CBN News, ""This is a big day for the people of Ohio and ultimately the United States. Democrats are scared. They can see the threat this bill has on Roe v. Wade and they are scared.""
How Could Ohio's Heartbeat Bill Lead to the Overturn of Roe v. Wade?
A leading component to the Roe decision was the balancing act between a woman's right to privacy and the life potentiality of the fetus. Thus, any chance to overturn Roe must involve similar components. Ohio's heartbeat bill does just that, and such language could easily initiate a revisit to the Roe decision.
Speaking with CBN News, Professor of political science at Biola University, Dr. Scott Waller, weighed in.
""The heartbeat bill seems, on its face, to challenge the idea that the developing fetus is only a potential life until it becomes viable at some point during the third trimester. If the courts determine that the presence of a heartbeat denotes the presence of an actual life (i.e., a real life separate and distinct from the mother) then this life would enjoy the protections of the 14th Amendment as even the Court admitted in Roe,"" Waller said.
In order for the Supreme Court to consider an overturn to Roe, the heartbeat bill must first be challenged. Such a challenge has already been promised by the ACLU, enlisting the pro-choice group Preterm-Cleveland as their Plaintiff. Planned Parenthood is also joining the ranks of legal opposition.
""We'll see you at the Supreme Court!"" said Iris Harvey, president of Planned Parenthood of Ohio.
The lawsuit is both expected and welcomed by Ohio state legislators.
""Will there be a lawsuit? Yeah, we are counting on it…We're excited about it,"" said Ohio state Rep. Ron Hood.
Clearly, a legal battle is looming – one that both sides are ready and willing to take to the highest court in the land.
Legal Director for the ACLU of Ohio, Freda Levenson, told CBN News she expects the law to be struck down. ""The so-called heartbeat bill is a clear violation of the precedent set forth in Roe. The jurists on the courts, regardless of their philosophy, have a duty to the Constitution which has already upheld Roe.""
While some pro-life policy-pushers have suggested the heartbeat bill was specifically drafted to overturn Roe, other pro-life activists see the potential overturn as a convenient result, but not necessarily the target idea.
President of Citizens for Community Values Aaron Baer told us, ""While the heartbeat bill was not specifically drafted to overturn Roe v. Wade, it was drafted to be Constitutional. An overturn to Roe v. Wade would simply be a result of the constitutional integrity of the heartbeat bill.""
What Would the Sequence of Court Decisions Look Like?
The ACLU of Ohio confirmed to CBN News that they will be filing in federal court. This would start in the Ohio District Court, followed by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, and then the United States Supreme Court. This is supposing all courts agree to review the case.
6th Circuit Court of Appeals
With President Trump following through on his campaign promise to appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court, the reality of a landmark overturn has become more viable.
It is important to note that in addition to SCOTUS appointees, Trump has appointed 95 judges to the lower federal courts, 37 of whom are on circuit courts. The Supreme Court is presented with approximately 7,000 cases a year and selects approximately 250 to review. Thus, circuit courts often set the precedent for their jurisdiction with no hierarchal influence.
The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals holds a heavy conservative leaning, with 11 of the 16 active judges reputably more conservative. Six of them are Trump appointees.
US Supreme Court Makeup
The appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch, while a victory for conservatives, did not change the jurisprudential demographics of the Court. Gorsuch's appointment prolonged the conservative influence of the late Justice Antonin Scalia but did not increase or decrease the Court's conservative influence.

Muslim Azerbaijan a Model for Co-Existence with Jewish State,www1.cbn.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/muslim-azerbaijan-a-model-for-co-existence-with-jewish-state,"Muslim Azerbaijan a Model for Co-Existence with Jewish State
BAKU - At a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise, one Muslim nation is getting attention for its friendship with Israel and the Jewish people. That country is Azerbaijan. Could it be a model for the rest of the Muslim world?
Azerbaijan sits at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Like Iran, its pre-Islamic days more than 800 years ago, were dominated by the religion of Zoroastrianism.
With a population of nearly 10 million it's the 90th largest country in the world.
It's strategically positioned with Iran on its southern border, Turkey to the west and Russia to the north.
Located on the Caspian Sea, this former Soviet republic is one of the world's major oil producers. The capital Baku is the country's economic center. ""Azerbaijan is a source for about anything between quarter to one-third of the oil import to Israel and this flow of high-quality oil is very important to the State of Israel,"" said Dan Stav, Israel's ambassador to Azerbaijan. Oil isn't the only thing flowing between the two countries. According to Azeri President Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijan has purchased nearly $5 billion worth of weapons systems from Israel. ""This is important for Azerbaijan to maintain its defense and existence in a very challenging strategic environment,"" Stav said. In an interview in the Azeri capital, Baku, Stav told CBN News about his efforts to diversify the economic cooperation between the two countries. ""Israel can be of help, especially in development of the agricultural sector, which is a priority of the government and we have cooperation with medical institutes and medical domain in general, education, IT,"" he said. And the relationship goes beyond economy and defense. ""To be an ambassador to Azerbaijan is a special privilege because the relations between the Azeri people preceded the relations with the Jewish state,"" Stav said.
""The Mountainous Jewish community, according to some historical accounts has preceded Islam, Christianity. The first Jews, according to some myth arrived to Azerbaijan after the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 before Christ,"" he added. The vast majority of the population here is Shiite Muslim but it's a secular country. For generations the Jewish community has felt at home here and since its independence, Azerbaijan has had good relations with Israel. In a 2016 visit to Azerbaijan both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Aliyev attested to the deep ties between Jews and Azeris.
""For centuries Jews and Azerbaijanis, lived in peace, friendship, and continue to live here in Azerbaijan and Jewish community in Azerbaijan is a very active part of our society. They contribute a lot to the development of modern Azerbaijan,"" Aliyev said. ""The attitude that you've shown to Jewish people in Azerbaijan over the years, one that has fostered this very strong bond of sympathy and admiration for Azerbaijan -- first of all with the 70,000 Jews who live in Israel, who are from Azerbaijan. It's a human bridge but also something we can show the world,"" Netanyahu said.
""The world sees so much intolerance, so much darkness. Well here is an example of what relations can be and should be between Muslims and Jews everywhere,"" Netanyahu added.
Many Azeri Jews from Israel go back regularly to visit their homeland.
""You don't do it if you come from an environment that (is) infested with anti-Semitism,"" Stav explained. Israel and Azerbaijan have had diplomatic relations since 1992 – after the fall of the Soviet Union. ""We don't consider Muslims as such our enemies and Azerbaijan is itself a proof that this is not the case,"" said Stav. In sharp contrast, Iran is the other Shi'ite Muslim majority country in the neighborhood. ""There's such a startling difference between the two countries. Azerbaijan showed that it's not a matter of Shia,"" Stav added.
Despite years of animosity, Stav said there's a growing understanding among Muslim states in the region.
""Israel is not an enemy and cooperation can be very beneficial,"" he said. ""Azerbaijan serves as an alternative model to the model that we know more – whether it's a Salafi Islam or the political Shia Islam led by Iran and the Hezbollah.""

WASHINGTON (AP) - Former Vice President Joe Biden formally joined the crowded Democratic presidential contest on Thursday, betting that his working-class appeal and ties to Barack Obama's presidency will help him overcome questions about his place in today's increasingly liberal Democratic Party. He made his announcement in a video posted on Twitter, declaring, ""We are in the battle for the soul of this nation."" ""If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation,"" Biden said. ""Who we are. And I cannot stand by and watch that happen."" Thursday's announcement marks the unofficial end of the chaotic early phase of the 2020 presidential season. The field now features at least 20 Democrats jockeying for the chance to take on President Donald Trump next year. Several lesser-known candidates may still join the race. Biden, a 76-year-old lifelong politician, becomes an instant front-runner alongside Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is leading many polls and has proved to be a successful fundraiser . Among Democrats, Biden has unmatched international and legislative experience, and he is among the best-known faces in U.S. politics. But the anti-establishment wave that swept Trump into office has not been kind to either party's statesmen. Biden's team worries about his fundraising ability and his tendency to commit gaffes. His centrist approach in a party moving left on major policy debates raises questions about his appeal. Four years Trump's senior, Biden would be the oldest person ever elected president should he win. Yet his allies believe the skeptics will ultimately warm to his strong connections to the Obama years. Biden has said he would campaign as an ""Obama-Biden Democrat,"" who is as pragmatic as he is progressive. He's aiming to be a conduit between working-class white voters and the younger, more diverse voters who backed Obama in historic numbers. The Republican Party wasted no time seeking to undercut Biden's record, releasing a video on Wednesday questioning economic growth under Obama and Biden while resurrecting conservative arguments against Obama's health care law and a failed investment in green energy company Solyndra. The video ends with the words, ""Joe Biden: Backwards, not forwards."" Yet privately, Trump allies have warned that Biden might be the biggest re-election threat given the former vice president's potential appeal among the white working class in the Midwest, the region that gave Trump a path to the presidency. The Republican video notably does not argue a Biden candidacy would lead to socialism, as Trump and his backers have said would happen with many in the large 2020 Democratic presidential field. Biden is paying special attention to Pennsylvania, a state that swung to Trump in 2016 after voting for Democratic presidential candidates for decades. The former vice president will be in the state three times within the opening weeks of his campaign. He'll be in Philadelphia on Thursday evening headlining a fundraiser at the home of David L. Cohen, executive senior vice president of Comcast. Biden is aiming to raise $500,000 at the event. He will hold an event in Pittsburgh on Monday and will return to Philadelphia in the next two weeks for a major rally. His plans were described by people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss his schedule and fundraising goals. With a record that stretches half a century, Biden's challenges are easy to find. Most recently, he struggled to respond to claims that he touched 2014 Nevada lieutenant governor nominee Lucy Flores' shoulders and kissed the back of her head before a fall campaign event. A handful of other women have made similar claims, though none has alleged sexual misconduct. Biden initially said he didn't recall the Flores incident but credited her with coming forward. He took a different approach in a subsequent statement, saying, ""Never did I believe I acted inappropriately."" Biden later pledged in an online video to be ""much more mindful"" of respecting personal space but joked two days later that he ""had permission"" to hug a male union leader before addressing the group's national conference. The episode offered a stark reminder of Biden's proclivity to gaffes and his long record in public office that has never felt the full glare of the spotlight that comes along with being a presidential front-runner. His first White House bid in 1988 ended after a plagiarism scandal. He dropped out of the 2008 race after earning less than 1 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses. Later that year, Obama named Biden as his running mate. More recently, Biden's willingness to work with Republicans has caused him political headaches. He was forced to walk back a comment last month that Vice President Mike Pence is ""a decent guy"" after intense blowback from liberal activists upset with Pence's opposition to gay rights. In recent weeks, Biden also has been repeatedly forced to explain his 1991 decision, as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, to allow Anita Hill to face difficult questions from an all-male panel about allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, who later was confirmed to the high court. Biden has since apologized for his role in the hearing. But in the #MeToo era, particularly after the contentious confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the episode remains a significant political liability. Likewise, Biden once played a key role in anti-crime legislation that had a disproportionately negative impact on African Americans. And while several 2020 Democratic contenders have embraced the possibility of reparations to African Americans for slavery in recent weeks, Biden last month struggled to explain comments he made as a freshman senator in 1975 about the school busing debate. Biden's 2020 bid comes four years after he opted against challenging Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic contest. In a book he wrote about conversations with his dying son, he opened up about the difficult choice to sit out the last presidential race: abandon a careerlong quest for the presidency or lose precious time with a family he'd held together through tragedy, from his first wife's and his daughter's deaths in a 1972 car accident to son Beau Biden's 2015 death from cancer. ""He was worried that what I'd worked on my whole life, the things that mattered to me the most since I was a kid, that I'd walk away,"" Biden said of his son. Ultimately, the draw to take on Trump in 2020 was too strong. Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

Major Archaeological Discovery Puts Biblical Excavators at Odds with Israeli Highway Construction,www1.cbn.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/major-archaeological-discovery-puts-biblical-excavators-at-odds-with-israeli-highway-construction,"Major Archaeological Discovery Puts Biblical Excavators at Odds with Israeli Highway Construction
A major archaeological discovery in Israel raised the question of how to preserve the past without stopping progress towards the future when a modern highway and an ancient town came to a crossroads.
""No one expected it, including the Israel Antiquities Authority,"" said Yehuda Govrin, who headed the salvage excavation at Beit Shemesh.
What they found was the biblical town of Beit Shemesh from the time of Isaiah and Hezekiah.
""We thought the Assyrians destroyed (it) and it took years for us (the Jewish people) to come back and that everyone left and there was no one here. But it's not true. And we know it's not true because we have these finds,"" said Amanda Weiss, director of the Bible Lands Museum (BLM).
Archaeologists thought a much earlier site on the other side of the road was all there was to ancient Beit Shemesh. But before expanding a highway they excavated and found a treasure.
""If the Israel Antiquities Authority would have known this is what was there, they wouldn't have allowed the development of the road there,"" Govrin told CBN News.
""What they understood from the finds is that after the city of Beit Shemesh was destroyed in the year 701 by Sennacherib the King of Assyria – a very, very famous historical and biblical event -- a new settlement was found not on the top of the mound but on the slope, on the eastern slope of the mound,"" said Yehuda Kaplan, curator of the Bible Lands Museum exhibit ' Highway Through History ' that contains artifacts from the site.
""And (it's) a very, very interesting settlement with a lot of olive oil industry and also a lot of administration,"" Kaplan told CBN News.
The road also connects to the Elah Valley where David killed Goliath and Beit Shemesh is associated with the return of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.
""We can read the Bible, we can study history, we can learn archaeology but when all of those three elements come together then we have the proof of that history and that historicity of the biblical text,"" Weiss told CBN News. ""So for us at the Bible Lands Museum, it's basically winning the lottery.""
Jar handles with royal seals, smashed figurines and other artifacts from the site are displayed in the exhibit. But there's more to the story.
""We walk the land and we're walking on top of history. The progress that is required to build a new nation with housing and roads and infrastructure requires digging down and building new things,"" Weiss said.
Modern-day Beit Shemesh is about 20 miles outside Jerusalem. It has a population of more than 110,000 and is growing fast.
""It's complicated because I want to protect the road. I want to protect the Tel, the site and I need to find the way to protect both of them. It's very important for everybody,"" Beit Shemesh Mayor Aliza Bloch told CBN News.
Archaeologists and developers knew they had to work together.
""The reality is that people need homes and roads to be created and there's this balance, there's this debate in how do we do it,"" Weiss said.
So they came up with a compromise plan to alter the road and still preserve the historical site with the hope of developing the past for future generations."

Jews and Christians are calling out Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and the New York Times for promoting the idea that Jesus was Palestinian, and not a Jew living in Roman-occupied Judea.
Omar faced backlash after she retweeted a tweet from Omar Suleiman, an American Muslim scholar and civil rights activist, accusing conservative Christians of being ignorant about Jesus' Palestinian heritage.
""I was once asked by a relative who is a Palestinian Christian why the Christian right in America largely supports their oppression,"" Suleiman wrote. ""Don't they know we're Christian too?

Just hours before that tweet, the New York Times published an opinion piece that claimed, ""Jesus, born in Bethlehem, was most likely a Palestinian man with dark skin.""
Jews and Christians alike quickly challenged the notion that Jesus was anything other than an Israeli Jew living under Roman occupation.
""No, @Ilhan Omar, Jesus was not a 'Palestinian', he was a Jew born in Israel under Roman occupation and your need to misrepresent history and misappropriate his background to further a political cause says more about you than it does about anything else,"" said Michael Dickson, Executive Director of StandWithUs-Israel.

The father of two of the Easter suicide bombers in Sri Lanka has been arrested on suspicion of aiding his sons. That word came Thursday from the country's former navy chief as a nationwide search continues for the suspected ring-leader of the Easter bombings in churches and hotels. Authorities say they are looking for Islamist preacher Zahran Hashmi who appeared in an ISIS video.
Police say it is unclear if Zahran actually detonated one of the bombs. But Anton Sudharshan of the British Pakistani Christians Association of Sri Lanka says Zahran is thought to have gathered with members of the Islamic group National Tawhid Jamaat just days before the attacks
""Three or five people were gathered together to pray for a mission and they had prayed and we see the result right now, it is evident in that is the connection that they had with ISIS,"" Sudharshan explained.
He believes some of the terrorist bombers may have fought overseas with ISIS.
""Mosque leaders - or you call them as imams - who were well trained, who were well educated and they went and they got ranks in ISIS and they fought and some of them died. After their death only it became known that there were also Sri Lankans among ISIS ranks and many would have found a very special way to return back without even the authorities maybe knowing about it.""
So how are Sri Lankan Christians responding and what can believers around the world do to help? Hear more from Sudharshan on the April 25th episode of the CBN News program The Global Lane. It's on the CBN News Channel tonight at 9:30 Eastern."

A woman who was in a coma with serious brain damage for nearly 30 years is awake.
She regained consciousness in a hospital in Germany in 2018. The National , a news outlet in the United Arab Emirates reported on her story this week. In 1991, Munira Abdulla picked up her 4-year-old son from school and headed to their home in Al Ain, a city in the UAE.
She was in the back seat with her child while her brother-in-law was driving. Suddenly, their car collided with an oncoming bus.
""When she saw the crash coming she hugged me to protect me from the blow,"" her son, Omar Webair, 32, told The National.
Miraculously, Webair walked away from the crash with no injuries. But it would be 27 years before he would ever hear his mother's voice again.
Abdulla received treatment for her severe brain injuries in London and Germany.
Webair was there when she spoke her first words after nearly 30 years.
""She was making strange sounds and I kept calling the doctors to examine her,"" Webair said. ""They said everything was normal. Then, three days later, I woke up to the sound of someone calling my name.""
""It was her. She was calling my name. I was flying with joy. For years I have dreamt of this moment, and my name was the first word she said.""
Webair said doctors thought he was crazy for still believing his mother would wake up after all these years.
""I never gave up on her because I always had a feeling that one day she will wake up,"" he said.
Abdulla is continuing to make progress and doctors say she is ""able to communicate in a very reasonable manner, especially in familiar situations.
She is currently being treated in Abu Dhabi.
Webair hopes her story will give hope to others who have loved ones in similar situations.
""All those years, the doctors told me she was a hopeless case and that there was no point of the treatment I was seeking for her, but whenever in doubt I put myself in her place and did whatever I could to improve her condition,"" he said."

Biden has said he would campaign as an ""Obama-Biden Democrat,"" who is as pragmatic as he is progressive. He's aiming to be a conduit between working-class white voters and the younger, more diverse voters who backed Obama in historic numbers.
The Republican Party wasted no time seeking to undercut Biden's record, releasing a video on Wednesday questioning economic growth under Obama and Biden while resurrecting conservative arguments against Obama's health care law and a failed investment in green energy company Solyndra.
The video ends with the words, ""Joe Biden: Backwards, not forwards.""
Yet privately, Trump allies have warned that Biden might be the biggest re-election threat given the former vice president's potential appeal among the white working class in the Midwest, the region that gave Trump a path to the presidency.
The Republican video notably does not argue a Biden candidacy would lead to socialism, as Trump and his backers have said would happen with many in the large 2020 Democratic presidential field.
Biden is paying special attention to Pennsylvania, a state that swung to Trump in 2016 after voting for Democratic presidential candidates for decades.
The former vice president will be in the state three times within the opening weeks of his campaign. He'll be in Philadelphia on Thursday evening headlining a fundraiser at the home of David L. Cohen, executive senior vice president of Comcast. Biden is aiming to raise $500,000 at the event.
He will hold an event in Pittsburgh on Monday and will return to Philadelphia in the next two weeks for a major rally.
His plans were described by people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss his schedule and fundraising goals.
With a record that stretches half a century, Biden's challenges are easy to find.
Most recently, he struggled to respond to claims that he touched 2014 Nevada lieutenant governor nominee Lucy Flores' shoulders and kissed the back of her head before a fall campaign event. A handful of other women have made similar claims, though none has alleged sexual misconduct.
Biden initially said he didn't recall the Flores incident but credited her with coming forward. He took a different approach in a subsequent statement, saying, ""Never did I believe I acted inappropriately.""
Biden later pledged in an online video to be ""much more mindful"" of respecting personal space but joked two days later that he ""had permission"" to hug a male union leader before addressing the group's national conference.
The episode offered a stark reminder of Biden's proclivity to gaffes and his long record in public office that has never felt the full glare of the spotlight that comes along with being a presidential front-runner.
His first White House bid in 1988 ended after a plagiarism scandal. He dropped out of the 2008 race after earning less than 1 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses. Later that year, Obama named Biden as his running mate.
More recently, Biden's willingness to work with Republicans has caused him political headaches.
He was forced to walk back a comment last month that Vice President Mike Pence is ""a decent guy"" after intense blowback from liberal activists upset with Pence's opposition to gay rights.
In recent weeks, Biden also has been repeatedly forced to explain his 1991 decision, as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, to allow Anita Hill to face difficult questions from an all-male panel about allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, who later was confirmed to the high court.
Biden has since apologized for his role in the hearing. But in the #MeToo era, particularly after the contentious confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the episode remains a significant political liability.
Likewise, Biden once played a key role in anti-crime legislation that had a disproportionately negative impact on African Americans. And while several 2020 Democratic contenders have embraced the possibility of reparations to African Americans for slavery in recent weeks, Biden last month struggled to explain comments he made as a freshman senator in 1975 about the school busing debate.
Biden's 2020 bid comes four years after he opted against challenging Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic contest.
In a book he wrote about conversations with his dying son, he opened up about the difficult choice to sit out the last presidential race: abandon a careerlong quest for the presidency or lose precious time with a family he'd held together through tragedy, from his first wife's and his daughter's deaths in a 1972 car accident to son Beau Biden's 2015 death from cancer.
""He was worried that what I'd worked on my whole life, the things that mattered to me the most since I was a kid, that I'd walk away,"" Biden said of his son.
Ultimately, the draw to take on Trump in 2020 was too strong.

"Trump Tackles Opioid Crisis: 'We Will Work, We Will Pray and We Will Fight' for a Drug-Free America",www.cbn.com,Jenna Browder,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/trump-tackles-opioid-crisis-we-will-work-we-will-pray-and-we-will-fight-for-a-drug-free-america-nbsp,"WASHINGTON – President Trump says his administration is making progress in the fight against opioids, investing billions of dollars and promising to hold drug makers accountable.
At a drug summit Wednesday in Atlanta, Trump gave a progress report on the efforts of his administration.
""My administration is deploying every resource at our disposal to empower you, to support you and to fight right by your side,"" he said.
Trump's speech came one day after his administration brought its first criminal charges against a major drug distributor - Rochester Drug Co-Operative is accused of turning a blind eye to thousands of suspicious orders for opioid pain killers.
""There is just nothing going to stop us, no matter how you cut it,"" said Trump.
In his speech he also announced his administration's commitment to set aside $6 billion for things like youth prevention and overdose-reversing drugs.
""We're going for even bigger numbers this year,"" he vowed, going on to list other administration accomplishments like convincing China to designate fentanyl, or synthetic heroin, as a controlled substance and cracking down on online sales.
Critics, though, say it's not enough.
Last year nearly 49,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses - that number up 17 percent from 2017.
The two top painkillers were fentanyl and heroin.
Some of the states hardest hit include New Hampshire, West Virginia, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
And in Chicago alone this week, police are investigating 13 overdoses and four deaths from heroin.
""We will work. We will pray. And we will fight for the day when every family across our land can live in a drug-free America,"" said Trump."
"'No, Jesus Was Not a Palestinian': Jews, Christians Blast Ilhan Omar for Claiming Jesus Wasn't Jewish",www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/no-jesus-was-not-a-palestinian-jews-christians-blast-ilhan-omar-for-claiming-jesus-wasnt-jewish,"Jews and Christians are calling out Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and the New York Times for promoting the idea that Jesus was Palestinian, and not a Jew living in Roman-occupied Judea.
Omar faced backlash after she retweeted a tweet from Omar Suleiman, an American Muslim scholar and civil rights activist, accusing conservative Christians of being ignorant about Jesus' Palestinian heritage.
""I was once asked by a relative who is a Palestinian Christian why the Christian right in America largely supports their oppression,"" Suleiman wrote. ""Don't they know we're Christian too? Do they even consider us human? Don't they know Jesus was a Palestinian?'

Just hours before that tweet, the New York Times published an opinion piece that claimed, ""Jesus, born in Bethlehem, was most likely a Palestinian man with dark skin.""
Jews and Christians alike quickly challenged the notion that Jesus was anything other than an Israeli Jew living under Roman occupation.
""No, @Ilhan Omar, Jesus was not a 'Palestinian', he was a Jew born in Israel under Roman occupation and your need to misrepresent history and misappropriate his background to further a political cause says more about you than it does about anything else,"" said Michael Dickson, Executive Director of StandWithUs-Israel.

Conservative commentator Allie Beth Stuckey accused Omar and others who claim Jesus is Palestinian of promoting revisionist history.
""People who call Jesus a 'Palestinian,' despite the fact that the geographical region of Palestine didn't exist until years after his death, are simply projecting modern-day intersectionality onto him in order to make their 'wokeness' seem biblical. This is idolatry,"" Stuckey said.

"Earth's Magnetic North Pole Is Shifting, Prompting Fears of a Coming Global Chaos",www.cbn.com,Dale Hurd,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/earths-magnetic-north-pole-is-shifting-prompting-fears-of-a-coming-global-chaos,"The Earth's north magnetic pole has been moving from its old location in Northern Canada towards Siberia. And there is a growing concern among scientists that the weakening of the Earth's magnetic field could someday cause its north and south poles to flip. And that could lead to global chaos.
The Earth's magnetic north has been moving ever since it was first discovered in 1831. It's driven by molten iron moving deep beneath the Earth's crust.
But now magnetic north is moving so quickly that it forced the world's geomagnetism experts to update the World Magnetic Model a year early.
That model is the basis for modern navigation, for ships and planes, satellites and smartphones, and it helps birds and other animals to navigate as well.
Dr. Hugh Ross, an astronomer and founder of Reasons to Believe , talks with Pat Robertson about what will happen if the Earth's magnetic poles flip on Thursday's 700 Club.
If Earth's magnetic field were to decay significantly, scientists say it could collapse altogether and flip polarity – changing magnetic north to south and south to north. The planet's magnetic poles are believed to have flipped before in earth history, but never in a time with such a dependence on technology.
And many scientists now say a flip of north and south is looking more and more certain.
Dr. Hugh Ross said, ""These reversals we've been hearing about – they have happened several hundred times in the past half-billion years of earth's history. And we already have a pretty good idea of what's going to happen during a reversal. It'll be similar to what happened in 1859 when we got hit by a big solar flare.""
The solar flare that hit in 1859 is known as the Carrington Event. It was a powerful geomagnetic storm caused by a solar coronal mass ejection, or CME, that hit Earth's magnetosphere and caused one of the largest geomagnetic storms on record on September 1 and 2, 1859.
A solar storm of this same magnitude occurring today would cause widespread electrical disruptions, blackouts, and damage to the world's electrical grids.
""It would probably knock out several of our GPS satellites,"" Ross said. ""And it would definitely knock out communications. The biggest consequence is the damage it would do to our electric power grids.""
Dr. Ross warned that since we know this is going to happen in the near future, the world's governments should prepare now by hardening their electrical grids.
He believes billions of dollars need to be invested now to prevent the coming disaster. ""That's a whole lot less than experiencing a shutdown of electric power grids for months or years,"" he said."
'White Supremacy' or 'Ridiculous Accusation'?

Aimed to increase inclusion, Michele Gillespie, dean of the college, has enacted multiple sessions this week for university staff and faculty of color to share their complaints. The College Fix reports the email invitations look like this: ""For staff who identify as staff of color ONLY: Monday, May 6 at 4:00 pm in ZSR Room 477""
The private North Carolina institution has seen growth in racial tensions recently as certain on-campus activist groups have continually demanded apologies, accusing school officials of a ""history of racism.""
Yesterday @wfuarc offered @PresidentHatch , Martha Allman, & Kevin Pittard the opportunity to come publicly apologize for the roles they've played in perpetuating WFU's white supremacy.

The College Fix reports the organizations have used previous situations such as a racist Instagram post from a fake WFU account and decades old blackface yearbook photos to support their claims.
The organizations have also criticized the university for allowing two WFU administrators to keep their jobs after a photo of surfaced of them posing in front of a Confederate flag in the 1980s.
The Winston-Salem Journal reported that ""a coalition of students, faculty and staff at Wake Forest University demanded Monday that university officials immediately begin a zero-tolerance policy for white supremacy after several developments in recent months heightened concerns about racism on campus.""

CA Supreme Court Halts Abortion Case About Baby Body Parts Trafficking by Planned Parenthood,www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/ca-supreme-court-halts-abortion-case-about-baby-body-parts-trafficking-by-planned-parenthood,"California's Supreme Court has halted an abortion case surrounding the trafficking of baby body parts by Planned Parenthood employees, granting pro-life activist David Daleiden an unexpected victory.
On Good Friday, a California Superior Court judge vacated the preliminary hearings against Daleiden and his co-defendant Sandra Merritt.
The action came after an order was sent by California Supreme Court Chief Justice Tani G. Cantil-Sakauye that suspended ""all further proceedings"" in the criminal prosecution against the two pro-lifers.
In 2015, Daleiden released undercover videos that exposed Planned Parenthood workers admitting to harvesting and selling baby body parts.
Planned Parenthood, along with several other groups, sued Daleiden. He was charged with 15 criminal felony counts for non-consensual eavesdropping and conspiracy as a result of the video-recordings. The hearings were scheduled to begin this week in San Francisco in an attempt to determine if there was sufficient evidence to warrant a trial.
Testimony from abortionists was set to be featured at the hearings as well as Daleiden's undercover videos.
Thomas Moore Society, which is representing Daleiden, is hoping to get another win out of this case. They released a statement saying, ""We are grateful for this welcome development and hopeful that the California Supreme Court will choose to hear and decide the extremely critical issue raised in this appeal, namely, whether a prosecutor may exercise his or her powers to enforce the criminal laws on a selective, politically discriminatory basis.""
The case has been prosecuted by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, successor to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Both have been closely allied with and supported by Planned Parenthood.
In an interview with CBN News, Vice President and Senior Counsel Peter Breen discussed the conflict of interest between Becerra and the case.
""So I can show you video, you can go online and find it of Attorney General Becerra on election night in front of an 'I Stand With Planned Parenthood' sign graciously thanking Planned Parenthood for being with him from the beginning,"" stated Breen.
""I remember 'I Stand With Planned Parenthood' was the key way that they rebutted the videos back in 2015 as these began, and that's been their mantra, trying to get people to say 'I stand with Planned Parenthood and against David Daleiden',"" he added.
""The earmarks of discrimination and bias are all too glaringly apparent,"" stated Thomas More Society President and Chief Counsel Tom Brejcha in a statement.
""At the very least,"" he continued, ""the attorney general should step aside and allow an unbiased prosecutor to decide whether this prosecution should go forward. But based on evidence of bias already adduced, the case should be dismissed.""
In a interesting twist, Breen informed CBN News that Planned Parenthood has been allowed to work with the attorney general in fighting the case.
""Planned Parenthood has actually filed for a motion to intervene in the criminal case"" he continued. ""And the judge has entertained it.""
Thomas Moore Society went on to state that the abortion organization cannot stand alongside Becerra in court, but they have helped in other ways such as providing ""evidence"".
""The court had entered an unprecedented order allowing private counsel for the complaining witnesses to participate in this criminal trial, whereas criminal prosecution is reserved for public officials, namely, state prosecutors whose duty is to represent all of 'the people,' not private parties or their partisan interests,"" stated Brejcha.
""The abortion industry representatives have also been allowed to proceed anonymously, and the court was set to prohibit the video evidence from being shown in public, after its viewing in open court,"" added Brejcha. ""Any photographs, broadcast or publication of the proceedings was barred, curtailing Daleiden and Merritt's rights to a public trial and to confront and cross-examine their accusers.""
""Worse,"" continued Brejcha, ""exonerating evidence favorable to the defense has been withheld and barred from use in the criminal case. This is a result of rulings by San Francisco Federal Judge William Orrick suppressing that evidence.""
""These restrictions have put Mr. Daleiden and his entire legal team into a straitjacket, as we are forced to defend against these serious felony charges while denied access to key evidence that would acquit our client,"" he added."

That word came Thursday from the country's former navy chief as a nationwide search continues for the suspected ring-leader of the Easter bombings in churches and hotels.
Authorities say they are looking for Islamist preacher Zahran Hashmi who appeared in an ISIS video.
Police say it is unclear if Zahran actually detonated one of the bombs. But Anton Sudharshan of the British Pakistani Christians Association of Sri Lanka says Zahran is thought to have gathered with members of the Islamic group National Tawhid Jamaat just days before the attacks
""Three or five people were gathered together to pray for a mission and they had prayed and we see the result right now, it is evident in that is the connection that they had with ISIS,"" Sudharshan explained.
He believes some of the terrorist bombers may have fought overseas with ISIS.
""Mosque leaders - or you call them as imams - who were well trained, who were well educated and they went and they got ranks in ISIS and they fought and some of them died. After their death only it became known that there were also Sri Lankans among ISIS ranks and many would have found a very special way to return back without even the authorities maybe knowing about it.""
So how are Sri Lankan Christians responding and what can believers around the world do to help?

Muslim Azerbaijan a Model for Co-Existence with Jewish State,www.cbn.com,Julie Stahl,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/muslim-azerbaijan-a-model-for-co-existence-with-jewish-state,"BAKU - At a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise, one Muslim nation is getting attention for its friendship with Israel and the Jewish people. That country is Azerbaijan. Could it be a model for the rest of the Muslim world?
Azerbaijan sits at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Like Iran, its pre-Islamic days more than 800 years ago, were dominated by the religion of Zoroastrianism.
With a population of nearly 10 million it's the 90th largest country in the world.
It's strategically positioned with Iran on its southern border, Turkey to the west and Russia to the north.
Located on the Caspian Sea, this former Soviet republic is one of the world's major oil producers. The capital Baku is the country's economic center.
""Azerbaijan is a source for about anything between quarter to one-third of the oil import to Israel and this flow of high-quality oil is very important to the State of Israel,"" said Dan Stav, Israel's ambassador to Azerbaijan.
Oil isn't the only thing flowing between the two countries. According to Azeri President Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijan has purchased nearly $5 billion worth of weapons systems from Israel.
""This is important for Azerbaijan to maintain its defense and existence in a very challenging strategic environment,"" Stav said.
In an interview in the Azeri capital, Baku, Stav told CBN News about his efforts to diversify the economic cooperation between the two countries.
""Israel can be of help, especially in development of the agricultural sector, which is a priority of the government and we have cooperation with medical institutes and medical domain in general, education, IT,"" he said.
And the relationship goes beyond economy and defense.
""To be an ambassador to Azerbaijan is a special privilege because the relations between the Azeri people preceded the relations with the Jewish state,"" Stav said.
""The Mountainous Jewish community, according to some historical accounts has preceded Islam, Christianity. The first Jews, according to some myth arrived to Azerbaijan after the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 before Christ,"" he added.
The vast majority of the population here is Shiite Muslim but it's a secular country. For generations the Jewish community has felt at home here and since its independence, Azerbaijan has had good relations with Israel.
In a 2016 visit to Azerbaijan both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Aliyev attested to the deep ties between Jews and Azeris.
""For centuries Jews and Azerbaijanis, lived in peace, friendship, and continue to live here in Azerbaijan and Jewish community in Azerbaijan is a very active part of our society. They contribute a lot to the development of modern Azerbaijan,"" Aliyev said.
""The attitude that you've shown to Jewish people in Azerbaijan over the years, one that has fostered this very strong bond of sympathy and admiration for Azerbaijan -- first of all with the 70,000 Jews who live in Israel, who are from Azerbaijan. It's a human bridge but also something we can show the world,"" Netanyahu said.
""The world sees so much intolerance, so much darkness. Well here is an example of what relations can be and should be between Muslims and Jews everywhere,"" Netanyahu added.
Many Azeri Jews from Israel go back regularly to visit their homeland.
""You don't do it if you come from an environment that (is) infested with anti-Semitism,"" Stav explained.
Israel and Azerbaijan have had diplomatic relations since 1992 – after the fall of the Soviet Union.
""We don't consider Muslims as such our enemies and Azerbaijan is itself a proof that this is not the case,"" said Stav.
In sharp contrast, Iran is the other Shi'ite Muslim majority country in the neighborhood.
""There's such a startling difference between the two countries. Azerbaijan showed that it's not a matter of Shia,"" Stav added.
Despite years of animosity, Stav said there's a growing understanding among Muslim states in the region.
""Israel is not an enemy and cooperation can be very beneficial,"" he said. ""Azerbaijan serves as an alternative model to the model that we know more – whether it's a Salafi Islam or the political Shia Islam led by Iran and the Hezbollah.""
The hope is that the Azeri-Israeli example of Muslim and Jew standing together will serve as an anchor of stability in the Middle East."
Major Archaeological Discovery Puts Biblical Excavators at Odds with Israeli Highway Construction,www.cbn.com,Julie Stahl,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/major-archaeological-discovery-puts-biblical-excavators-at-odds-with-israeli-highway-construction,"A major archaeological discovery in Israel raised the question of how to preserve the past without stopping progress towards the future when a modern highway and an ancient town came to a crossroads.
""No one expected it, including the Israel Antiquities Authority,"" said Yehuda Govrin, who headed the salvage excavation at Beit Shemesh.
What they found was the biblical town of Beit Shemesh from the time of Isaiah and Hezekiah.
""We thought the Assyrians destroyed (it) and it took years for us (the Jewish people) to come back and that everyone left and there was no one here. But it's not true. And we know it's not true because we have these finds,"" said Amanda Weiss, director of the Bible Lands Museum (BLM).
Archaeologists thought a much earlier site on the other side of the road was all there was to ancient Beit Shemesh. But before expanding a highway they excavated and found a treasure.
""If the Israel Antiquities Authority would have known this is what was there, they wouldn't have allowed the development of the road there,"" Govrin told CBN News.
""What they understood from the finds is that after the city of Beit Shemesh was destroyed in the year 701 by Sennacherib the King of Assyria – a very, very famous historical and biblical event -- a new settlement was found not on the top of the mound but on the slope, on the eastern slope of the mound,"" said Yehuda Kaplan, curator of the Bible Lands Museum exhibit ' Highway Through History ' that contains artifacts from the site.
""And (it's) a very, very interesting settlement with a lot of olive oil industry and also a lot of administration,"" Kaplan told CBN News.
The road also connects to the Elah Valley where David killed Goliath and Beit Shemesh is associated with the return of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.
""We can read the Bible, we can study history, we can learn archaeology but when all of those three elements come together then we have the proof of that history and that historicity of the biblical text,"" Weiss told CBN News. ""So for us at the Bible Lands Museum, it's basically winning the lottery.""
Jar handles with royal seals, smashed figurines and other artifacts from the site are displayed in the exhibit. But there's more to the story.
""We walk the land and we're walking on top of history. The progress that is required to build a new nation with housing and roads and infrastructure requires digging down and building new things,"" Weiss said.
Modern-day Beit Shemesh is about 20 miles outside Jerusalem. It has a population of more than 110,000 and is growing fast.
""It's complicated because I want to protect the road. I want to protect the Tel, the site and I need to find the way to protect both of them. It's very important for everybody,"" Beit Shemesh Mayor Aliza Bloch told CBN News.
Archaeologists and developers knew they had to work together.
""The reality is that people need homes and roads to be created and there's this balance, there's this debate in how do we do it,"" Weiss said.
So they came up with a compromise plan to alter the road and still preserve the historical site with the hope of developing the past for future generations."
Woman Wakes from 30-Year Coma After Saving Son in Horrific Car Wreck: 'I Was Flying with Joy',www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/woman-wakes-from-30-year-coma-after-saving-son-in-horrific-car-wreck-i-was-flying-with-joy,"A woman who was in a coma with serious brain damage for nearly 30 years is awake.
She regained consciousness in a hospital in Germany in 2018. The National , a news outlet in the United Arab Emirates reported on her story this week.
In 1991, Munira Abdulla picked up her 4-year-old son from school and headed to their home in Al Ain, a city in the UAE.
She was in the back seat with her child while her brother-in-law was driving. Suddenly, their car collided with an oncoming bus.
""When she saw the crash coming she hugged me to protect me from the blow,"" her son, Omar Webair, 32, told The National.
Miraculously, Webair walked away from the crash with no injuries. But it would be 27 years before he would ever hear his mother's voice again.
Abdulla received treatment for her severe brain injuries in London and Germany.
Webair was there when she spoke her first words after nearly 30 years.
""She was making strange sounds and I kept calling the doctors to examine her,"" Webair said. ""They said everything was normal. Then, three days later, I woke up to the sound of someone calling my name.""
""It was her. She was calling my name. I was flying with joy. For years I have dreamt of this moment, and my name was the first word she said.""
Webair said doctors thought he was crazy for still believing his mother would wake up after all these years.
""I never gave up on her because I always had a feeling that one day she will wake up,"" he said.
Abdulla is continuing to make progress and doctors say she is ""able to communicate in a very reasonable manner, especially in familiar situations.

WASHINGTON – President Trump says his administration is making progress in the fight against opioids, investing billions of dollars and promising to hold drug makers accountable.
At a drug summit Wednesday in Atlanta, Trump gave a progress report on the efforts of his administration.
""My administration is deploying every resource at our disposal to empower you, to support you and to fight right by your side,"" he said.
Trump's speech came one day after his administration brought its first criminal charges against a major drug distributor - Rochester Drug Co-Operative is accused of turning a blind eye to thousands of suspicious orders for opioid pain killers.
""There is just nothing going to stop us, no matter how you cut it,"" said Trump.
In his speech he also announced his administration's commitment to set aside $6 billion for things like youth prevention and overdose-reversing drugs.
""We're going for even bigger numbers this year,"" he vowed, going on to list other administration accomplishments like convincing China to designate fentanyl, or synthetic heroin, as a controlled substance and cracking down on online sales.
Critics, though, say it's not enough.
Last year nearly 49,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses - that number up 17 percent from 2017.
The two top painkillers were fentanyl and heroin.
Some of the states hardest hit include New Hampshire, West Virginia, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
And in Chicago alone this week, police are investigating 13 overdoses and four deaths from heroin.
""We will work. We will pray. And we will fight for the day when every family across our land can live in a drug-free America,"" said Trump."
"Dems' 2020 'Medicare for All' Plan Compared to Failed Veterans Healthcare, Like 'Soviet Grocery Stores'",www1.cbn.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/dems-2020-medicare-for-all-plan-compared-to-failed-veterans-healthcare-like-soviet-grocery-stores,"Dems' 2020 'Medicare for All' Plan Compared to Failed Veterans Healthcare, Like 'Soviet Grocery Stores' 04-25-2019
WASHINGTON – The debate over ""Medicare for all"" is heading to the Hill. Democrats have scheduled the first-ever hearing on a plan to eliminate private health insurance in favor of a government-run program next Tuesday in the House of Representatives.
One thing Republicans and Democrats do agree on is that the American health care system is broken. But Republicans, and even some Democrats, contend that replacing what's broken with a government fix is a recipe for disaster.
Health care has become the central campaign issue of 2020 since Democratic presidential frontrunner Sen. Bernie Sanders unveiled his plan for a single payer system to replace private health insurance companies early this month.
""Healthcare is a human right, not a privilege,"" said Sanders, echoing the motto that has become a mantra among Democrats.
""The best way to go forward in my view is through a 'Medicare for all,' single payer program,"" Sanders said at a CNN town hall this week.
And he's not the only presidential candidate taking ""Medicare for All"" to the trail.
""We need to have 'Medicare for all',"" that's just the bottom line, said California Sen. Kamala Harris. Harris, speaking at the town hall, said, ""Having a system that makes a difference in terms of who receives what based on your income is unconscionable, it is cruel, and in many situations that I have witnessed, inhumane."" But the vision of more affordable coverage that lowers the number of uninsured is meeting a political reality. The 19th Democrat to enter the 2020 race came out against a single-payer system.
""If I'm elected, I'm not going to force you off your private healthcare plan,"" said Massachusetts Congressman Seth Moulton, announcing his candidacy on ABC.
Moulton is a former Marine Corps officer who receives health care through the Veterans Health Administration.
""I think every American should have access to good affordable healthcare, but I made a commitment to continue getting my own healthcare at the VA when I was elected to Congress, that's single-payer, and I'll tell you it's not perfect,"" he said. Bob Moffit of the Heritage Foundation says that plan is the closest thing in the United States to ""Medicare for all"" and ""that is a very bad way to run a health care program."" The Veteran's Health Administration, says Moffit, is ""positively scandalous,"" with ""bureaucratic manipulation of waiting lists resulting in the delay and the denial of care.""
Moffit contends that cutting private insurance companies out of the equation is a bad solution.
""The result would be something like American medical clinics being turned into the equivalent of Soviet grocery stores,"" he said. President Trump insists a Republican plan will be ready for a vote after the 2020 election. Moffit says that's too little, too late, and that the President should articulate a vision of health care reform now. Some estimates put the cost of a ""Medicare for all"" plan at anywhere from $25- to $35-Trillion over just 10 years. Under the plan, 180 million Americans would see their private health insurance replaced with a public plan."
Franklin Graham Delivers More Biblical Truth to Gay Democrat Pete Buttigieg,www1.cbn.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/franklin-graham-delivers-more-biblical-truth-to-gay-democrat-pete-buttigieg,"Franklin Graham Delivers More Biblical Truth to Gay Democrat Pete Buttigieg 04-25-2019 CBN News
Evangelist Franklin Graham is once again challenging the comments about Christianity and homosexuality that were made recently by Democratic presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Buttigieg has been critical of Christian leaders like Vice President Mike Pence who stand for the biblical definition of marriage. Buttigieg is a homosexual and is married to another man.
Pence had never attacked Buttigieg, but as CBN News has reported, Buttigieg made it sound like he did. ""I wish the Mike Pence's of the world would understand, that if you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is not with me,"" Buttigieg said earlier this month. ""Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.""
Answering multiple comments Buttigieg made about God, Graham tweeted, ""Presidential candidate & South Bend Mayor @PeteButtigieg is right—God doesn't have a political party. But God does have commandments, laws & standards He gives us to live by. God doesn't change. His Word is the same yesterday, today & forever."" Presidential candidate & South Bend Mayor @PeteButtigieg is right—God doesn't have a political party. But God does have commandments, laws & standards He gives us to live by. God doesn't change. His Word is the same yesterday, today & forever. 1/3 https://t.co/QHDNY3pwzJ
— Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) April 24, 2019
Graham continued, ""Mayor Buttigieg says he's a gay Christian. As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women."" Mayor Buttigieg says he's a gay Christian.

""The core of the Christian faith is believing and following Jesus Christ, who God sent to be the Savior of the world—to save us from sin, to save us from hell, to save us from eternal damnation,"" Graham said. The core of the Christian faith is believing and following Jesus Christ, who God sent to be the Savior of the world—to save us from sin, to save us from hell, to save us from eternal damnation. 3/3

This is the second time Graham has confronted Buttigieg over his claims of being a homosexual Christian. A week ago Graham said on Facebook, ""Protesters shouting 'Sodom and Gomorrah' interrupted mayor and 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg this week at a rally in Iowa. I don't agree with heckling anyone—I think we should be respectful.""
""In response, Buttigieg made the comment, 'the condition of my soul is in the hands of God …' Mayor Buttigieg is absolutely right—His soul is in the hands of God, so is everyone's. He also says that he's a Christian and wants to become the first openly gay president in America's history. What's wrong with that picture? In reality, being a Christian isn't just a title we select or a church membership. It is a faith in God and His Word that transforms our lives to be more like the One we follow—Jesus Christ.""
""Jesus said, 'If you love me, you will keep my commandments' (John 14:15). The Bible makes it very clear that homosexuality is a sin. 'If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination...' (Leviticus 20:13). That's what God says and that settles it for me. I stand with the Word of God. I care enough about people to tell them the truth and to warn them about the judgment to come for all sin."""
"Sri Lankan Woman Left a Childless Widow, Losing Most of Her Family in Easter Church Bombing",www1.cbn.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/sri-lankan-woman-left-a-childless-widow-losing-most-of-her-family-in-easter-church-bombing,"Sri Lankan Woman Left a Childless Widow, Losing Most of Her Family in Easter Church Bombing 04-25-2019 6029904333001 Anusha_HD1080_0_96.811 Anusha Kumari, with bandages on her left eye weeps during a mass burial for her husband, two children and three siblings, all victims of Easter Sunday bomb blast in Negombo, Sri Lanka, Wednesday, April 24, 2019. (AP Photo/Gemunu Amarasinghe) 6029904333001 Sri Lankan Woman Left a Childless Widow, Losing Most of Her Family in Easter Church Bombing
Before the undertakers could move in, Anusha Kumari wrested herself away from her sisters and flung herself on the three coffins, wailing. In an instant, she was left childless and a widow when suicide bombers attacked churches and luxury hotels in and near Sri Lanka's capital of Colombo.
The toll was highest at St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo. Of the more than 350 people killed by the suicide bombings that the government blamed on Muslim extremists, about a third of them died at the church in the seaside fishing town while attending Easter Mass.
And perhaps no one lost more relatives than 43-year-old Kumari, whose daughter, son, husband, sister-in-law and two nieces were killed.
They were buried three days later near the church on vacant land that has quickly become a cemetery for the victims.
Kumari, who was injured from the blast, left the hospital to bury her family. Afterward, she reclined in a cane chair at her home, hooked up to an IV dangling from an open window. Gauze bandages covered the bridge of her nose and her right eye. There was still shrapnel in her face.
A photo of her children was on the wall, while on the shelf were small statues of Jesus, Mary and St. Sebastian, an early Christian martyr riddled with wounds from Roman arrows.
She could see her son's drum kit on the upstairs landing, a gift from his father after doing well on exams, and a school portrait of her daughter. All day, relatives, neighbors and nuns wandered in and out of the large house, offering food, consolation and prayer.
""You won't believe it, but I had the perfect family,"" Kumari said. ""In 24 years of marriage, my husband and I never argued. All four of us slept in the same room. Now I have lost everything.""
Tears mixed with blood from her bandaged right eye.
""All these people, they have their own families. They'll go home and I'll be alone,"" she said.
A brother-in-law, Jude Prasad Appuhami, said his extended family, one of the oldest and most prominent in Catholic-majority Negombo, marked all the religious holidays and rituals at St. Sebastian's, a Gothic-style church patterned after Reims Cathedral in France.
On Easter, though, he wasn't in church with his 15 relatives because he had to drive a vehicle carrying a statue of Christ for a parade after Mass.
Appuhami arrived midway through the service and heard the blast from the parking lot. He rushed in and was overwhelmed by the sight of so much blood. One of his sisters-in-law, who survived, shouted for him to help their niece.
He found her with her eyes open, picked her up and rushed to the hospital, only to realize she was dead.
Appuhami's wife and 10-year-old daughter, sitting in an alcove to the left of the altar, escaped with minor injuries. His 17-year-old daughter, Rusiri, who was sitting at the front of the church because she was going to do a reading from Scripture, also survived, but she was left with nerve damage that makes eating painful.
On Wednesday, she struggled to grasp what she has seen.
""I don't know how to think of it. It's like a dream,"" she said.
During the funeral at the makeshift cemetery near St. Sebastian's, where mourners had to pass through security checks, a military drone buzzed overhead as the Rev. Niroshan Perera led prayers for the dead.
Perera, who grew up with Kumari's husband, Dulip Appuhami, and his siblings, recalled going as a boy with his friends and family to the church's well, where the faithful believed the water could cure them of diseases.
When the funeral ended, Perera encouraged everyone to go home quickly, fearing another attack.
Perera, who lost 16 relatives and friends in the blast, said he no longer trusted the Sri Lankan government to protect his flock."
CA Supreme Court Halts Abortion Case About Baby Body Parts Trafficking by Planned Parenthood,www1.cbn.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/ca-supreme-court-halts-abortion-case-about-baby-body-parts-trafficking-by-planned-parenthood,"CA Supreme Court Halts Abortion Case About Baby Body Parts Trafficking by Planned Parenthood
California's Supreme Court has halted an abortion case surrounding the trafficking of baby body parts by Planned Parenthood employees, granting pro-life activist David Daleiden an unexpected victory.
On Good Friday, a California Superior Court judge vacated the preliminary hearings against Daleiden and his co-defendant Sandra Merritt.
The action came after an order was sent by California Supreme Court Chief Justice Tani G. Cantil-Sakauye that suspended ""all further proceedings"" in the criminal prosecution against the two pro-lifers.
In 2015, Daleiden released undercover videos that exposed Planned Parenthood workers admitting to harvesting and selling baby body parts.
Planned Parenthood, along with several other groups, sued Daleiden. He was charged with 15 criminal felony counts for non-consensual eavesdropping and conspiracy as a result of the video-recordings. The hearings were scheduled to begin this week in San Francisco in an attempt to determine if there was sufficient evidence to warrant a trial.
Testimony from abortionists was set to be featured at the hearings as well as Daleiden's undercover videos.
Thomas Moore Society, which is representing Daleiden, is hoping to get another win out of this case. They released a statement saying, ""We are grateful for this welcome development and hopeful that the California Supreme Court will choose to hear and decide the extremely critical issue raised in this appeal, namely, whether a prosecutor may exercise his or her powers to enforce the criminal laws on a selective, politically discriminatory basis.""
The case has been prosecuted by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, successor to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Both have been closely allied with and supported by Planned Parenthood.
In an interview with CBN News, Vice President and Senior Counsel Peter Breen discussed the conflict of interest between Becerra and the case.
""So I can show you video, you can go online and find it of Attorney General Becerra on election night in front of an 'I Stand With Planned Parenthood' sign graciously thanking Planned Parenthood for being with him from the beginning,"" stated Breen.
""I remember 'I Stand With Planned Parenthood' was the key way that they rebutted the videos back in 2015 as these began, and that's been their mantra, trying to get people to say 'I stand with Planned Parenthood and against David Daleiden',"" he added.
""The earmarks of discrimination and bias are all too glaringly apparent,"" stated Thomas More Society President and Chief Counsel Tom Brejcha in a statement.
""At the very least,"" he continued, ""the attorney general should step aside and allow an unbiased prosecutor to decide whether this prosecution should go forward. But based on evidence of bias already adduced, the case should be dismissed.""
In a interesting twist, Breen informed CBN News that Planned Parenthood has been allowed to work with the attorney general in fighting the case.
""Planned Parenthood has actually filed for a motion to intervene in the criminal case"" he continued. ""And the judge has entertained it.""
Thomas Moore Society went on to state that the abortion organization cannot stand alongside Becerra in court, but they have helped in other ways such as providing ""evidence"". ""The court had entered an unprecedented order allowing private counsel for the complaining witnesses to participate in this criminal trial, whereas criminal prosecution is reserved for public officials, namely, state prosecutors whose duty is to represent all of 'the people,' not private parties or their partisan interests,"" stated Brejcha.
""The abortion industry representatives have also been allowed to proceed anonymously, and the court was set to prohibit the video evidence from being shown in public, after its viewing in open court,"" added Brejcha. ""Any photographs, broadcast or publication of the proceedings was barred, curtailing Daleiden and Merritt's rights to a public trial and to confront and cross-examine their accusers."" ""Worse,"" continued Brejcha, ""exonerating evidence favorable to the defense has been withheld and barred from use in the criminal case. This is a result of rulings by San Francisco Federal Judge William Orrick suppressing that evidence.""
""These restrictions have put Mr. Daleiden and his entire legal team into a straitjacket, as we are forced to defend against these serious felony charges while denied access to key evidence that would acquit our client,"" he added."

Wake Forest Hosts 'Listening Sessions' for Faculty and Staff of Color ONLY 04-25-2019 Christian Ellis Wake Forest University (Photo: WFU Website)
Wake Forest University is hosting a series of ""listening sessions"" for faculty and staff of color after growing racial tensions based on accusations that the school has supported ""white supremacy.""
Aimed to increase inclusion, Michele Gillespie, dean of the college, has enacted multiple sessions this week for university staff and faculty of color to share their complaints. The College Fix reports the email invitations look like this: ""For staff who identify as staff of color ONLY: Monday, May 6 at 4:00 pm in ZSR Room 477""
The private North Carolina institution has seen growth in racial tensions recently as certain on-campus activist groups have continually demanded apologies, accusing school officials of a ""history of racism."" Yesterday @wfuarc offered @PresidentHatch , Martha Allman, & Kevin Pittard the opportunity to come publicly apologize for the roles they've played in perpetuating WFU's white supremacy. Of the three, Pres. Hatch was the only one to come, but he still refused to address the crowd. pic.twitter.com/fdfAtbjQqB

The College Fix reports the organizations have used previous situations such as a racist Instagram post from a fake WFU account and decades old blackface yearbook photos to support their claims.
The organizations have also criticized the university for allowing two WFU administrators to keep their jobs after a photo of surfaced of them posing in front of a Confederate flag in the 1980s.
The Winston-Salem Journal reported that ""a coalition of students, faculty and staff at Wake Forest University demanded Monday that university officials immediately begin a zero-tolerance policy for white supremacy after several developments in recent months heightened concerns about racism on campus.""
""Today, ARC and @out_winston stood in solidarity against how @WakeForest embodies, emboldens, and perpetuates white supremacy,"" tweeted the Wake Forest University Anti-Racism Coalition. ""This goes far beyond our campus walls. #WhiteForest1834 #OnOurTerms #OurC2C""

In an interview with The College Fix, one professor, who requested anonymity, stated, ""It's hard to respond to the ridiculous accusation that Wake Forest tolerates or encourages 'white supremacy' and inflicts 'trauma on students of color.""
""I question whether it is worth responding to people who use such hyperbolic and hysterical rhetoric,"" they added. ""Though the more you placate them, the more they escalate their rhetoric and demands.""
Last month, the school's president Hatch granted numerous demands such as giving the Black Student Alliance control of a popular campus lounge."
"Earth's Magnetic North Pole Is Shifting, Prompting Fears of a Coming Global Chaos",www1.cbn.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/earths-magnetic-north-pole-is-shifting-prompting-fears-of-a-coming-global-chaos,"Earth's Magnetic North Pole Is Shifting, Prompting Fears of a Coming Global Chaos
The Earth's north magnetic pole has been moving from its old location in Northern Canada towards Siberia. And there is a growing concern among scientists that the weakening of the Earth's magnetic field could someday cause its north and south poles to flip. And that could lead to global chaos.
The Earth's magnetic north has been moving ever since it was first discovered in 1831. It's driven by molten iron moving deep beneath the Earth's crust.
But now magnetic north is moving so quickly that it forced the world's geomagnetism experts to update the World Magnetic Model a year early.
That model is the basis for modern navigation, for ships and planes, satellites and smartphones, and it helps birds and other animals to navigate as well. Dr. Hugh Ross, an astronomer and founder of Reasons to Believe , talks with Pat Robertson about what will happen if the Earth's magnetic poles flip on Thursday's 700 Club.
If Earth's magnetic field were to decay significantly, scientists say it could collapse altogether and flip polarity – changing magnetic north to south and south to north. The planet's magnetic poles are believed to have flipped before in earth history, but never in a time with such a dependence on technology.
And many scientists now say a flip of north and south is looking more and more certain.
Dr. Hugh Ross said, ""These reversals we've been hearing about – they have happened several hundred times in the past half-billion years of earth's history. And we already have a pretty good idea of what's going to happen during a reversal. It'll be similar to what happened in 1859 when we got hit by a big solar flare.""
The solar flare that hit in 1859 is known as the Carrington Event. It was a powerful geomagnetic storm caused by a solar coronal mass ejection, or CME, that hit Earth's magnetosphere and caused one of the largest geomagnetic storms on record on September 1 and 2, 1859.
A solar storm of this same magnitude occurring today would cause widespread electrical disruptions, blackouts, and damage to the world's electrical grids.
""It would probably knock out several of our GPS satellites,"" Ross said. ""And it would definitely knock out communications. The biggest consequence is the damage it would do to our electric power grids.""
Dr. Ross warned that since we know this is going to happen in the near future, the world's governments should prepare now by hardening their electrical grids.
He believes billions of dollars need to be invested now to prevent the coming disaster. ""That's a whole lot less than experiencing a shutdown of electric power grids for months or years,"" he said."
Wash Day,feeds.cbn.com,Beth.Patch,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://feeds.cbn.com/devotions/wash-day,"It was “Wash Day.” Elise got right to work separating the laundry into piles. She loaded the washer, reached for the cleaning agents, and meticulously measured the bleach, detergent, and fabric softener, pouring each into their respective receptacles.
Elise hit the start button.
As soon as she glanced at the remaining piles, she realized she had made a terrible mistake. The white clothes were still on the floor.
“No!” Elise exclaimed, jamming the stop-cycle button.
She removed her permanent-press clothing and replaced them with whites. She was relieved she had retrieved her business attire before the bleach had dispensed.
“Why did I do that?” she said. Elise quickly answered her own question, “It is because I was just going through the motions.” Doing laundry wasn’t something Elise prioritized; rather, it was a chore she did because it was necessary. She didn’t mind the routine of Wash Day, but she didn’t value it.
Elise poured coffee, sat, and opened her Bible. She read about Mary of Bethany who had been going through the motions of religion until Jesus rescued her from a life of sin. Now, Mary offered Jesus her most precious gift—an alabaster box with anointing perfume, which was her dowry. As she did so, her tears fell upon her Master's feet, which she wiped clean with her hair. No longer was Mary content to go through the motions of lifeless religion; rather, she was devoted to Jesus with every ounce of her being.
“She hath washed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.” Luke 7:44b KJV
Mary loved Jesus! She would follow Him even to the cross. Mary believed Jesus would give His life on the cross, so she anointed Him for burial ahead of time with her best gift—the anointing oil—with the hopes also that He would rise again.
Elise thought about the twelve disciples. All except Judas were devoted. They were willing to give up their livelihoods to follow their master. She felt she must be just as committed to prioritizing her time with Jesus. She thought about others who had invited Jesus into their homes or had in other ways sacrificed to honor Him. These early Christians were devoted. She must do the same.
“Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.” Luke 18:28 KJV
Elise set her Bible on the stand.
“My Jesus,” she whispered, “am I going through the motions with my religious ways? Am I focusing my attention on You when I read Your Word? Do I have the gratitude of Mary when I sit at Your feet? Remake me, Lord. Help me to recognize You paid the ultimate price—that of death on a cross—in order to forgive me as You did these. The least I can give You is a heart wholly devoted to You. Create in me the heart of a worshiper.”
Gently, almost imperceptive at first, the rain of the Holy Spirit began to descend upon Elise. The washer buzzed, but Elise stayed seated. Why? It was “Wash Day,” and the Lord was answering Elise’s heartfelt prayer. A song of praise and thanksgiving, as well as peace unfettered, saturated Elise’s humble heart. She sang into the evening, and then, stillness permeated her soul. In the silence, Elise felt the empowerment of her Savior as never before.
It was Wash Day, and Elise had become a worshipper.
Lord Jesus, Wash over me with Your love. Reign in my heart each day.

I Keep Asking,feeds.cbn.com,Beth.Patch,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://feeds.cbn.com/devotions/i-keep-asking,"Mary Albers Felkins
""I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know Him better."" Ephesians 1:17 (NIV)
My father raised me to never, never give up. In fact, recently he asserted, “Down two runs with two outs in the home half of the ninth is no time to quit. Many games have been won under greater deficits. Persistence pays.”
No doubt he regretted his teaching when we were on vacation and within range of a gift shop.
Let the whining begin. “Daddy, can I puhleasse get a souvenir?” Never mind that he’d already blessed me with one. I’d convinced myself I needed another.
My husband and I have a son who we’ve affectionately referred to as our “persistent widow.” Why? Because, even at 20, he’s the one who keeps asking and asking and asking, hopeful he’ll get what he’s after. In matters of righteousness, this has been a blessing and demonstrated good character and courage. But on several occasions, we’ve had to say, “Enough.” And he’d stop asking.
Until a more opportune time.
To those in our sphere of influence, it’s wise to teach and enforce the biblical principle to let your ""Yes"" be yes, and your ""No"" be no (James 5:12). Otherwise, we’ll do nothing but perpetuate an already self-indulgent culture and lose the respect of those we hope to influence. Yet, there are situations when God invites – and even urges – us to keep asking.
""Then Jesus told His disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up."" Luke 18:1 (NIV) A persistent widow sought justice against her adversary, albeit from a judge who was not a God-fearing man. If for no other reason than to get her to hush up so her begging wouldn’t wear him out, the judge granted her request. Luke 18:5 (Paraphrase mine)
If we carry a particular burden, desire justice, or need salvation, provision, or healing, we must keep asking. Because, unlike the unjust and godless judge referenced in Luke 18, our God loves us perfectly. He is wholly just and promises to deliver answers in His good and perfect timing.
But be warned. Satan will mock our persistent prayers with a wicked chuckle and will take advantage of moments of discouragement. During those days and seasons when the answers we desire haven’t yet arrived, the enemy is determined to silence our persistent prayers. If we let him.
The prophet Isaiah understood the directive to keep asking.
""You who call on the Lord, give yourselves no rest, and give Him no rest till He establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth."" Isaiah 62:6b-7
Where the will of God is concerned, not only are we to keep asking, we’re charged with giving God no rest about a matter. Doesn’t sound anything like a flustered, eye-rolling judge. Quite the contrary.
So long as we maintain an unwavering faith in God when we petition Him, there is great purpose and power in persistent prayer. Let’s not quit when weariness sets in at the 25-mile mark of a marathon or, as my father has taught, when we’re down two runs with two outs in the home half of the ninth. Not only will persistence change our hearts to be more like Jesus, but the recipient of our prayers will be forever grateful.

A man came to his pastor and said, “Pastor, would you please pray that God will give me patience?”
Two weeks later, he returned and said, “Good grief, Pastor! Terrible things are happening to me. My life’s coming unglued.”
“Well,” replied the pastor, “you wanted patience. The Bible says, ‘Tribulation works patience,’ so I prayed for tribulation. God must be answering my prayer.”
Although persecution is inflicted by enemies of God, He can use it to mold us into greater Christlikeness. As Paul told us, “We also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope” (Rom. 5:3-4). Contrary to what we often hear, the call to follow Christ is not a call to an easy life.
As John Ortberg put it, “God isn’t at work producing the circumstances I want. God is at work in bad circumstances to produce the me he wants.” Suffering Provokes Courage
Courage reflects Christ’s character in adverse circumstances. It is the crucial virtue that Christians must deploy when facing cultural demands that conflict with biblical teaching.
The apostles Peter and John faced such a demand when the Jewish leaders hauled them into court and told them to cease preaching Christ. Peter and John replied, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard” (Acts 4:19-20).
After Paul’s conversion, his life became a sterling example of this kind of courage. As he wrote to the Philippians, “I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain” (Phil. 1:20-21). Suffering Proves Godliness
A. W. Tozer wrote, “To be right with God has often meant to be in trouble with men.” As Paul put it, “All who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution” (2 Tim. 3:12). It’s a matter of simple logic: Why would the enemies of Christianity bother anyone who is not displaying the nature of Christ?
The writer of Hebrews said, “Whom the Lord loves He chastens” (Heb. 12:6). D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones wrote, “If you are suffering as a Christian, and because you are a Christian, it is one of the surest proofs you can ever have of the fact that you are a child of God.” Suffering Produces Joy
When we realize the purpose and positive results of suffering persecution, it can become a source of joy, as it was for Paul and Silas when they encountered opposition. In Acts 16:22-24, they were arrested, beaten, and thrown into prison. Then we read, “At midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them” (v. 25).
These disciples, beaten and imprisoned without a trial, were so joyful they burst into song! This tells us that the source of joy is our relationship with God, and that relationship is affirmed when we courageously endure persecution. Suffering Provides Rewards
The Scriptures abound with promises of rewards for those who endure suffering. Often we allow these future rewards to be obscured by immediate gratifications. Moses could easily have allowed the immediate to obscure the distant. Raised as a prince in Egypt’s royal palace, he had access to riches, pleasure, status, and power. But the Bible tells us, “By faith Moses . . . refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the reward” (Heb. 11:24-26).
Moses was willing not only to turn his back on immediate pleasure, position, and power but also to suffer affliction in order to receive the promised eternal reward.
What are some of the rewards promised to those who endure persecution? They will be avenged (Rev. 6:9-11; 16:5-7; 18:20; 19:2). They will be given perfect and abundant lives free of sorrow (Rev. 7:14-17). They will find eternal rest (Rev. 14:13). They will receive the crown of eternal life (James 1:12). They will have no more death to fear (1 Cor. 15:54; Rev. 20:14).
These are just a few of the rewards that await those who suffer persecution for Christ’s sake. Paul wrote, “I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us” (Rom. 8:18).

WASHINGTON – As a Marine and son of war veterans, Col. Oliver North says he's spent most of his life in the company of heroes. Now as president of the National Rifle Association he's taking his passion for telling their stories to NRA TV and so far, each episode of "" Oliver North's American Heroes "" highlights men and women of faith facing risk to help others.
Heroes of Faith
""I mean the Bible is full of heroes and you see the purpose of that being related to us is to inspire us to be better than what we otherwise might be,"" he tells CBN News. He's shining light on people like Jason Brown, a successful pro-football player turned farmer. ""Jason Brown was the highest paid center that ever played in the NFL and his brother was killed in this long war that we're still and he looked at himself in the mirror one morning and he said to himself – you know, I'm making all this money, I've got the fame, I've got the fortune, he's got the size as you can tell and said I need to do something to give back,"" North explains. CBN also caught up with Brown at his ""First Fruits Farm"" where he grows food for people in need. ""His faith is palpable. He doesn't wear it on his sleeve but what he does with his faith is to show the kind of response that you get to the opportunities that the good Lord puts in front of you,"" North says. Heroic Traits
Brown's commitment to what he's been called to do is also palpable and North says that's a common trait among heroes. ""Commitment is something that's absolutely essential to carrying out the purpose that the good Lord put for us here,"" North says. In the most recent episode of ""Oliver North's American Heroes"" North highlights the heroic duty of Tanner Primmer. ""This is a maritime deputy sheriff down at Cape Canaveral where he's based. There's a very narrow ship channel to get those enormous cruise ships in and out and you can see it on the video."" On this particular day, the cruise ship captain sounded his horn five times to alert Primmer of danger ahead. Two girls had fallen off of a jet ski and the wind was blowing them into the path of the ship. ""And he [Primmer] takes his boat right in front of the cruise ship which can't stop, and you see that shadow coming,"" North says. Video taken by passengers on the cruise ship shows Primmer working to rescue the girls as a giant shadow from the cruise ship is cast upon them. North calls Primmer's duty that day ""an extraordinary act of heroism."""
"As Warning Emerges of New Sri Lanka Church Attacks, Why Is Global Christian Persecution so 'Obscured'?",www1.cbn.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/as-warning-emerges-of-new-sri-lanka-church-attacks-why-is-global-christian-persecution-so-obscured,"As Warning Emerges of New Sri Lanka Church Attacks, Why Is Global Christian Persecution so 'Obscured'? 04-25-2019 Heather Sells
Sri Lankan Christians fear more attacks are coming as the nation is still in mourning over the horrific bombings on Easter Sunday.
At least 253 people were killed and hundreds more were wounded. Thursday the number was decreased from 350 to 253, officials explaining that they initially thought many people had been killed due to unidentifiable body parts.
In two major cities in Sri Lanka it's very quiet as residents and office workers are staying indoors and shops are closed. There's concern that more attacks are on the way with the US embassy warning that terrorists could target places of worship again this weekend.
Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe issued a stark warning Thursday saying, ""Well, they've rounded up a lot of suspects but there are still some of the active people on the run. They may be having explosives with them, or they may have hidden the explosives so we have to find the suspects as well as the explosives. So that's still on.""
Last Sunday's bombings were one of the world's worst terrorist attacks since 9/11, but there's still a sense that Americans don't grasp that Christians around the world are so targeted.
Doug Bandow, an analyst at the CATO Institute wrote, ""Christianity's dominant role in American culture has obscured the fact that it is the most persecuted faith globally."" And Emma Green, an Atlantic writer, says that Easter has become an ""anniversary of death, ""noting Easter attacks on Christians in Egypt and Nigeria in the last several years."
'We'll See You at the Supreme Court!' How Ohio's Heartbeat Bill Threatens Roe,www1.cbn.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/well-see-you-at-the-supreme-court-how-ohios-heartbeat-bill-threatens-roe,"'We'll See You at the Supreme Court!' How Ohio's Heartbeat Bill Threatens Roe 04-24-2019 Baby in the womb (Photo: Adobe Stock)
ANALYSIS
This month may have seen the initial judicial step in overturning the landmark abortion case, Roe v. Wade.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has signed into state law one of the most restrictive pro-life bills in the United States: SB 23, otherwise known as the ""heartbeat bill.""
Inside the Heartbeat Bill
SB 23 prohibits abortions if a heartbeat is detected, which according to the American Pregnancy Association (APA) starts between 5 ½ to 6 ½ weeks. APA also reports that most women discover they're pregnant at 5-7 weeks development. That said, many women don't know they're pregnant until after a baby's heartbeat begins and thus many women who would have otherwise chosen abortion will be prohibited from doing so.
The bill does allow for an exception if the mother's life is at risk, but not for circumstances of rape or incest.
The bill also requires that women who seek but cannot attain an abortion are counseled on adoption options.
Chairman of the Ohio House Health Committee, Rep. Derek Merrin, told CBN News that he acknowledged the threat that this bill has to the Roe decision. ""This bill was constructed to save lives, and with the standard we've set, we certainly expect the Roe decision to be challenged.""
Jena Powell, representative for Ohio's 80th district, praised the passing of the law and told CBN News, ""This is a big day for the people of Ohio and ultimately the United States. Democrats are scared. They can see the threat this bill has on Roe v. Wade and they are scared.""
How Could Ohio's Heartbeat Bill Lead to the Overturn of Roe v. Wade?
A leading component to the Roe decision was the balancing act between a woman's right to privacy and the life potentiality of the fetus. Thus, any chance to overturn Roe must involve similar components. Ohio's heartbeat bill does just that, and such language could easily initiate a revisit to the Roe decision.
Speaking with CBN News, Professor of political science at Biola University, Dr. Scott Waller, weighed in.
""The heartbeat bill seems, on its face, to challenge the idea that the developing fetus is only a potential life until it becomes viable at some point during the third trimester. If the courts determine that the presence of a heartbeat denotes the presence of an actual life (i.e., a real life separate and distinct from the mother) then this life would enjoy the protections of the 14th Amendment as even the Court admitted in Roe,"" Waller said.
In order for the Supreme Court to consider an overturn to Roe, the heartbeat bill must first be challenged. Such a challenge has already been promised by the ACLU, enlisting the pro-choice group Preterm-Cleveland as their Plaintiff. Planned Parenthood is also joining the ranks of legal opposition.
""We'll see you at the Supreme Court!"" said Iris Harvey, president of Planned Parenthood of Ohio.
The lawsuit is both expected and welcomed by Ohio state legislators.
""Will there be a lawsuit? Yeah, we are counting on it…We're excited about it,"" said Ohio state Rep. Ron Hood.
Clearly, a legal battle is looming – one that both sides are ready and willing to take to the highest court in the land.
Legal Director for the ACLU of Ohio, Freda Levenson, told CBN News she expects the law to be struck down. ""The so-called heartbeat bill is a clear violation of the precedent set forth in Roe. The jurists on the courts, regardless of their philosophy, have a duty to the Constitution which has already upheld Roe.""
While some pro-life policy-pushers have suggested the heartbeat bill was specifically drafted to overturn Roe, other pro-life activists see the potential overturn as a convenient result, but not necessarily the target idea.
President of Citizens for Community Values Aaron Baer told us, ""While the heartbeat bill was not specifically drafted to overturn Roe v. Wade, it was drafted to be Constitutional. An overturn to Roe v. Wade would simply be a result of the constitutional integrity of the heartbeat bill.""
What Would the Sequence of Court Decisions Look Like?
The ACLU of Ohio confirmed to CBN News that they will be filing in federal court. This would start in the Ohio District Court, followed by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, and then the United States Supreme Court. This is supposing all courts agree to review the case.
6th Circuit Court of Appeals
With President Trump following through on his campaign promise to appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court, the reality of a landmark overturn has become more viable.
It is important to note that in addition to SCOTUS appointees, Trump has appointed 95 judges to the lower federal courts, 37 of whom are on circuit courts. The Supreme Court is presented with approximately 7,000 cases a year and selects approximately 250 to review. Thus, circuit courts often set the precedent for their jurisdiction with no hierarchal influence.
The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals holds a heavy conservative leaning, with 11 of the 16 active judges reputably more conservative. Six of them are Trump appointees.
US Supreme Court Makeup
The appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch, while a victory for conservatives, did not change the jurisprudential demographics of the Court. Gorsuch's appointment prolonged the conservative influence of the late Justice Antonin Scalia but did not increase or decrease the Court's conservative influence.
However, the appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the high Court may change the jurisprudential demographics, since his predecessor, Justice Anthony Kennedy, historically ruled against the pro-life agenda. Kennedy was a key player in the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey which effectively upheld Roe with little change.
But the current demographics of the Supreme Court are only so relative to the Ohio heartbeat bill, since the appellate process can take between 4-6 years. Two of the Court's liberal justices are also the two oldest: Justices Breyer at 80 and Ginsburg at 86. By the time the heartbeat bill makes its way to the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg may have retired, if not also Breyer.
If Trump's history of SCOTUS appointees remains consistent, and assuming his reelection, the conservative majority on the Court could shift from 5-4 to 6-3 or even 7-2 if both of the Court's eldest justices retire by the time this case makes its way to the high court. If Trump is not reelected, the Court's shift may fall towards a liberal influence."
Franklin Graham Delivers More Biblical Truth to Gay Democrat Pete Buttigieg,www.cbn.com,CBN News,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/franklin-graham-delivers-more-biblical-truth-to-gay-democrat-pete-buttigieg,"Evangelist Franklin Graham is once again challenging the comments about Christianity and homosexuality that were made recently by Democratic presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Buttigieg has been critical of Christian leaders like Vice President Mike Pence who stand for the biblical definition of marriage. Buttigieg is a homosexual and is married to another man.
Pence had never attacked Buttigieg, but as CBN News has reported, Buttigieg made it sound like he did. ""I wish the Mike Pence's of the world would understand, that if you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is not with me,"" Buttigieg said earlier this month. ""Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.""
Answering multiple comments Buttigieg made about God, Graham tweeted, ""Presidential candidate & South Bend Mayor @PeteButtigieg is right—God doesn't have a political party. But God does have commandments, laws & standards He gives us to live by. God doesn't change. His Word is the same yesterday, today & forever.""

— Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) April 24, 2019
Graham continued, ""Mayor Buttigieg says he's a gay Christian. As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women.""

""The core of the Christian faith is believing and following Jesus Christ, who God sent to be the Savior of the world—to save us from sin, to save us from hell, to save us from eternal damnation,"" Graham said.

This is the second time Graham has confronted Buttigieg over his claims of being a homosexual Christian. A week ago Graham said on Facebook, ""Protesters shouting 'Sodom and Gomorrah' interrupted mayor and 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg this week at a rally in Iowa. I don't agree with heckling anyone—I think we should be respectful.""
""In response, Buttigieg made the comment, 'the condition of my soul is in the hands of God …' Mayor Buttigieg is absolutely right—His soul is in the hands of God, so is everyone's. He also says that he's a Christian and wants to become the first openly gay president in America's history. What's wrong with that picture? In reality, being a Christian isn't just a title we select or a church membership. It is a faith in God and His Word that transforms our lives to be more like the One we follow—Jesus Christ.""
""Jesus said, 'If you love me, you will keep my commandments' (John 14:15). The Bible makes it very clear that homosexuality is a sin. 'If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination...' (Leviticus 20:13). That's what God says and that settles it for me. I stand with the Word of God. I care enough about people to tell them the truth and to warn them about the judgment to come for all sin."""
"Dems' 2020 'Medicare for All' Plan Compared to Failed Veterans Healthcare, Like 'Soviet Grocery Stores'",www.cbn.com,Gabe LaMonica,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/dems-2020-medicare-for-all-plan-compared-to-failed-veterans-healthcare-like-soviet-grocery-stores,"WASHINGTON – The debate over ""Medicare for all"" is heading to the Hill.
Democrats have scheduled the first-ever hearing on a plan to eliminate private health insurance in favor of a government-run program next Tuesday in the House of Representatives.
One thing Republicans and Democrats do agree on is that the American health care system is broken. But Republicans, and even some Democrats, contend that replacing what's broken with a government fix is a recipe for disaster.
Health care has become the central campaign issue of 2020 since Democratic presidential frontrunner Sen. Bernie Sanders unveiled his plan for a single payer system to replace private health insurance companies early this month.
""Healthcare is a human right, not a privilege,"" said Sanders, echoing the motto that has become a mantra among Democrats.
""The best way to go forward in my view is through a 'Medicare for all,' single payer program,"" Sanders said at a CNN town hall this week.
And he's not the only presidential candidate taking ""Medicare for All"" to the trail.
""We need to have 'Medicare for all',"" that's just the bottom line, said California Sen. Kamala Harris.
Harris, speaking at the town hall, said, ""Having a system that makes a difference in terms of who receives what based on your income is unconscionable, it is cruel, and in many situations that I have witnessed, inhumane.""
But the vision of more affordable coverage that lowers the number of uninsured is meeting a political reality.
The 19th Democrat to enter the 2020 race came out against a single-payer system.
""If I'm elected, I'm not going to force you off your private healthcare plan,"" said Massachusetts Congressman Seth Moulton, announcing his candidacy on ABC.
Moulton is a former Marine Corps officer who receives health care through the Veterans Health Administration.
""I think every American should have access to good affordable healthcare, but I made a commitment to continue getting my own healthcare at the VA when I was elected to Congress, that's single-payer, and I'll tell you it's not perfect,"" he said.
Bob Moffit of the Heritage Foundation says that plan is the closest thing in the United States to ""Medicare for all"" and ""that is a very bad way to run a health care program.""
The Veteran's Health Administration, says Moffit, is ""positively scandalous,"" with ""bureaucratic manipulation of waiting lists resulting in the delay and the denial of care.""
Moffit contends that cutting private insurance companies out of the equation is a bad solution.
""The result would be something like American medical clinics being turned into the equivalent of Soviet grocery stores,"" he said.
President Trump insists a Republican plan will be ready for a vote after the 2020 election. Moffit says that's too little, too late, and that the President should articulate a vision of health care reform now.
Some estimates put the cost of a ""Medicare for all"" plan at anywhere from $25- to $35-Trillion over just 10 years. Under the plan, 180 million Americans would see their private health insurance replaced with a public plan."

North calls Primmer's duty that day ""an extraordinary act of heroism.""
The Power of Prayer
In this episode, there's a moment where North gets emotional while talking to Primmer's wife.
""I asked her if she prayed. And I told her a story about what a wife had told me when we were in the armor business. I made armor, my patents are in armor. And we both got choked up about it, but it's another common characteristic of all of it. These are people of great faith,"" he says.
However, North fears, these days, the word ""hero"" doesn't mean as much as it used to.
""You know, you say the word hero and somebody has visions of somebody wearing a spandex suit and a cape, while my heroes wear flak jackets and combat boots and flight suits and they carry guns and badges and they go to work in danger every day,"" he says, and he tells CBN News, he considers keeping company with them one of the great blessings of his life."
"Loving Teachers, Your Unions Persecute Christians and Ex-Gays",www.cbn.com,Rebecca Friedrichs,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/loving-teachers-your-unions-persecute-christians-and-ex-gays,"COMMENTARY
""They blackballed me because I was an ex-gay.""
That's what happened to my friend Jeralee Smith when she dared to speak out as a teacher delegate at the National Education Association's Representative Assembly (NEA RA). Why? Jeralee advocated for balance and wholesome values in NEA-supported sex education curricula.
Teachers like Jeralee and me are terrified to speak out at massive union meetings — all we really want to do is teach. Jeralee never dreamed she'd share her personal story of struggles with sexual issues, but the unions' sexual agenda is pushed onto students as young as pre-school, and teachers and parents are outraged, so she stepped up to the microphone to address 8,000 delegates. She loved her students too much to remain silent.
Jeralee told me, ""I made it personal. Even though there were a lot of people who were supportive in a silent way, (NEA) didn't want to hear anything; they just wanted us to shut up and go away. They blackballed me because I was an ex-gay. I was never electable again after that.""
Why would a teachers' union care if Jeralee is an ex-gay? Isn't that her personal prerogative? Aren't unions supposed to concern themselves with fair pay and working conditions? They've defined themselves as exemplars of tolerance, inclusivity, anti-bullying, the protectors of the vulnerable and ""the world's largest democratic deliberative body."" But these are all lies. In reality they're vicious, and they masquerade as ""teacher advocates"" — while using our profession and money to fund their angry, far-left agenda.
Being ex-gay doesn't fit their narrative. That's why they bully ex-gays. So Jeralee, Sue Halvorson and several brave teachers run an NEA Ex-Gay Educators' Caucus. They've spent their personal time and money reproducing verified, medically accurate and educationally sound materials to present at the NEA RA for decades. As a result, they've been blacklisted from serving on sex education-related committees, maligned, told they belong in hell and isolated as pariahs. This is their punishment for refusing to bow down to union think.
It's troubling, but ex-gays aren't the only group to be singled out and bullied regularly at NEA RA meetings — Christians are too.
Sue Halvorson and her friend once attended an NEA RA pre-conference talk called, ""The Rise of the Religious Right: The Implications for Democracy."" Her friend told me, ""They started characterizing us Christians with inflammatory rhetoric. They said the religious right was so intolerant, have an intolerant spirit, a willingness to condemn everyone, have no regard for true diversity...we're dangerous; we're causing this crisis in democracy.""
In order to silence ex-gays and Christians completely, New Business Item 86 was adopted at the 2017 NEA assembly. It states ""NEA will thoroughly review and evaluate exhibitors' materials for information that is offensive, obscene, or in bad taste"" with ""special scrutiny"" on: ""NEA Ex-Gay Educators, the Creation Truth Outreach, and the Creation Science Educators.""
The attacks on loving teachers who speak out in defense of children and traditional American values are constant and brutal.
So, Diane Lenning started a Republican Educators Caucus in the NEA RA to give voice to millions who've been silenced. Her caucus submitted an objection to the NEA president after the NEA gave its coveted Human Rights award to a teacher who revealed that he chose not to report a 16-year old boy's sexual relationship with a grown man. Since education professionals serve as mandatory reporters of abuse or sexual inducement toward students, Diane told me, ""Many education leaders felt it went against teacher ethics to present a human rights award to a teacher who ignored his required duty to protect students.""
Did the NEA admire their concern for child safety and professional standards? Heavens no. NEA member-teacher activists threw a giant fit and tried to stage a coup to oust Diane as leader of her own caucus. They failed by only one vote. Dissenters accused Diane's group of being biased against LGBT individuals, but their objections had nothing to do with the sexual choices of others. They stood against the award recipient because he failed to report the sexual exploitation of a minor under his supervision.
Loving teachers defend and protect all children and families no matter their religion, political leanings or sexual orientation. Make no mistake, teachers' unions don't represent our hearts or ethics. Unions use us, silence us, and undermine the traditional values most teachers cherish. Claiming to be tolerant, inclusive, and protectors of vulnerable kids and teachers, union activists persecute Christians and ex-gays and promote bullying through ""how-to"" classes with titles like, ""How to Deal with Conservative Right-Wing Extremists."" Then they label loving teachers like me ""spawn of Satan"" for daring to stand up to them.
Teachers who remain in NEA should heed Diane's warning: ""This is an organized group of teachers who will use your money against you and all the people in America who believe similarly to you, and the money is the issue. They have the money. The money brings them power.""

In two major cities in Sri Lanka it's very quiet as residents and office workers are staying indoors and shops are closed. There's concern that more attacks are on the way with the US embassy warning that terrorists could target places of worship again this weekend.
Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe issued a stark warning Thursday saying, ""Well, they've rounded up a lot of suspects but there are still some of the active people on the run.

"Sri Lankan Woman Left a Childless Widow, Losing Most of Her Family in Easter Church Bombing",www.cbn.com,Associated Press,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/sri-lankan-woman-left-a-childless-widow-losing-most-of-her-family-in-easter-church-bombing,"Before the undertakers could move in, Anusha Kumari wrested herself away from her sisters and flung herself on the three coffins, wailing. In an instant, she was left childless and a widow when suicide bombers attacked churches and luxury hotels in and near Sri Lanka's capital of Colombo.
The toll was highest at St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo. Of the more than 350 people killed by the suicide bombings that the government blamed on Muslim extremists, about a third of them died at the church in the seaside fishing town while attending Easter Mass.
And perhaps no one lost more relatives than 43-year-old Kumari, whose daughter, son, husband, sister-in-law and two nieces were killed.
They were buried three days later near the church on vacant land that has quickly become a cemetery for the victims.
Kumari, who was injured from the blast, left the hospital to bury her family. Afterward, she reclined in a cane chair at her home, hooked up to an IV dangling from an open window. Gauze bandages covered the bridge of her nose and her right eye. There was still shrapnel in her face.
A photo of her children was on the wall, while on the shelf were small statues of Jesus, Mary and St. Sebastian, an early Christian martyr riddled with wounds from Roman arrows.
She could see her son's drum kit on the upstairs landing, a gift from his father after doing well on exams, and a school portrait of her daughter. All day, relatives, neighbors and nuns wandered in and out of the large house, offering food, consolation and prayer.
""You won't believe it, but I had the perfect family,"" Kumari said. ""In 24 years of marriage, my husband and I never argued. All four of us slept in the same room. Now I have lost everything.""
Tears mixed with blood from her bandaged right eye.
""All these people, they have their own families. They'll go home and I'll be alone,"" she said.
A brother-in-law, Jude Prasad Appuhami, said his extended family, one of the oldest and most prominent in Catholic-majority Negombo, marked all the religious holidays and rituals at St. Sebastian's, a Gothic-style church patterned after Reims Cathedral in France.
On Easter, though, he wasn't in church with his 15 relatives because he had to drive a vehicle carrying a statue of Christ for a parade after Mass.
Appuhami arrived midway through the service and heard the blast from the parking lot. He rushed in and was overwhelmed by the sight of so much blood. One of his sisters-in-law, who survived, shouted for him to help their niece.
He found her with her eyes open, picked her up and rushed to the hospital, only to realize she was dead.
Appuhami's wife and 10-year-old daughter, sitting in an alcove to the left of the altar, escaped with minor injuries. His 17-year-old daughter, Rusiri, who was sitting at the front of the church because she was going to do a reading from Scripture, also survived, but she was left with nerve damage that makes eating painful.
On Wednesday, she struggled to grasp what she has seen.
""I don't know how to think of it. It's like a dream,"" she said.
During the funeral at the makeshift cemetery near St. Sebastian's, where mourners had to pass through security checks, a military drone buzzed overhead as the Rev. Niroshan Perera led prayers for the dead.
Perera, who grew up with Kumari's husband, Dulip Appuhami, and his siblings, recalled going as a boy with his friends and family to the church's well, where the faithful believed the water could cure them of diseases.
When the funeral ended, Perera encouraged everyone to go home quickly, fearing another attack.
Perera, who lost 16 relatives and friends in the blast, said he no longer trusted the Sri Lankan government to protect his flock."

"Loving Teachers, Your Unions Persecute Christians and Ex-Gays",www1.cbn.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/loving-teachers-your-unions-persecute-christians-and-ex-gays,"Loving Teachers, Your Unions Persecute Christians and Ex-Gays 04-25-2019 Rebecca Friedrichs (Photo used by permission)
COMMENTARY
""They blackballed me because I was an ex-gay.""
That's what happened to my friend Jeralee Smith when she dared to speak out as a teacher delegate at the National Education Association's Representative Assembly (NEA RA). Why? Jeralee advocated for balance and wholesome values in NEA-supported sex education curricula.
Teachers like Jeralee and me are terrified to speak out at massive union meetings — all we really want to do is teach. Jeralee never dreamed she'd share her personal story of struggles with sexual issues, but the unions' sexual agenda is pushed onto students as young as pre-school, and teachers and parents are outraged, so she stepped up to the microphone to address 8,000 delegates. She loved her students too much to remain silent.
Jeralee told me, ""I made it personal. Even though there were a lot of people who were supportive in a silent way, (NEA) didn't want to hear anything; they just wanted us to shut up and go away. They blackballed me because I was an ex-gay. I was never electable again after that.""
Why would a teachers' union care if Jeralee is an ex-gay? Isn't that her personal prerogative? Aren't unions supposed to concern themselves with fair pay and working conditions? They've defined themselves as exemplars of tolerance, inclusivity, anti-bullying, the protectors of the vulnerable and ""the world's largest democratic deliberative body."" But these are all lies. In reality they're vicious, and they masquerade as ""teacher advocates"" — while using our profession and money to fund their angry, far-left agenda. Being ex-gay doesn't fit their narrative. That's why they bully ex-gays. So Jeralee, Sue Halvorson and several brave teachers run an NEA Ex-Gay Educators' Caucus. They've spent their personal time and money reproducing verified, medically accurate and educationally sound materials to present at the NEA RA for decades. As a result, they've been blacklisted from serving on sex education-related committees, maligned, told they belong in hell and isolated as pariahs. This is their punishment for refusing to bow down to union think.
It's troubling, but ex-gays aren't the only group to be singled out and bullied regularly at NEA RA meetings — Christians are too.
Sue Halvorson and her friend once attended an NEA RA pre-conference talk called, ""The Rise of the Religious Right: The Implications for Democracy."" Her friend told me, ""They started characterizing us Christians with inflammatory rhetoric. They said the religious right was so intolerant, have an intolerant spirit, a willingness to condemn everyone, have no regard for true diversity...we're dangerous; we're causing this crisis in democracy.""
In order to silence ex-gays and Christians completely, New Business Item 86 was adopted at the 2017 NEA assembly. It states ""NEA will thoroughly review and evaluate exhibitors' materials for information that is offensive, obscene, or in bad taste"" with ""special scrutiny"" on: ""NEA Ex-Gay Educators, the Creation Truth Outreach, and the Creation Science Educators.""
The attacks on loving teachers who speak out in defense of children and traditional American values are constant and brutal.
So, Diane Lenning started a Republican Educators Caucus in the NEA RA to give voice to millions who've been silenced. Her caucus submitted an objection to the NEA president after the NEA gave its coveted Human Rights award to a teacher who revealed that he chose not to report a 16-year old boy's sexual relationship with a grown man. Since education professionals serve as mandatory reporters of abuse or sexual inducement toward students, Diane told me, ""Many education leaders felt it went against teacher ethics to present a human rights award to a teacher who ignored his required duty to protect students.""
Did the NEA admire their concern for child safety and professional standards? Heavens no. NEA member-teacher activists threw a giant fit and tried to stage a coup to oust Diane as leader of her own caucus. They failed by only one vote. Dissenters accused Diane's group of being biased against LGBT individuals, but their objections had nothing to do with the sexual choices of others. They stood against the award recipient because he failed to report the sexual exploitation of a minor under his supervision.
Loving teachers defend and protect all children and families no matter their religion, political leanings or sexual orientation. Make no mistake, teachers' unions don't represent our hearts or ethics. Unions use us, silence us, and undermine the traditional values most teachers cherish. Claiming to be tolerant, inclusive, and protectors of vulnerable kids and teachers, union activists persecute Christians and ex-gays and promote bullying through ""how-to"" classes with titles like, ""How to Deal with Conservative Right-Wing Extremists."" Then they label loving teachers like me ""spawn of Satan"" for daring to stand up to them.
Teachers who remain in NEA should heed Diane's warning: ""This is an organized group of teachers who will use your money against you and all the people in America who believe similarly to you, and the money is the issue. They have the money. The money brings them power.""

Major Archaeological Discovery Puts Biblical Excavators at Odds with Israeli Highway Construction | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/major-archaeological-discovery-puts-biblical-excavators-at-odds-with-israeli-highway-construction,"Major Archaeological Discovery Puts Biblical Excavators at Odds with Israeli Highway Construction
A major archaeological discovery in Israel raised the question of how to preserve the past without stopping progress towards the future when a modern highway and an ancient town came to a crossroads.
""No one expected it, including the Israel Antiquities Authority,"" said Yehuda Govrin, who headed the salvage excavation at Beit Shemesh.
What they found was the biblical town of Beit Shemesh from the time of Isaiah and Hezekiah.
""We thought the Assyrians destroyed (it) and it took years for us (the Jewish people) to come back and that everyone left and there was no one here. But it's not true. And we know it's not true because we have these finds,"" said Amanda Weiss, director of the Bible Lands Museum (BLM).
Archaeologists thought a much earlier site on the other side of the road was all there was to ancient Beit Shemesh. But before expanding a highway they excavated and found a treasure.
""If the Israel Antiquities Authority would have known this is what was there, they wouldn't have allowed the development of the road there,"" Govrin told CBN News.
""What they understood from the finds is that after the city of Beit Shemesh was destroyed in the year 701 by Sennacherib the King of Assyria – a very, very famous historical and biblical event -- a new settlement was found not on the top of the mound but on the slope, on the eastern slope of the mound,"" said Yehuda Kaplan, curator of the Bible Lands Museum exhibit ' Highway Through History ' that contains artifacts from the site.
""And (it's) a very, very interesting settlement with a lot of olive oil industry and also a lot of administration,"" Kaplan told CBN News.
The road also connects to the Elah Valley where David killed Goliath and Beit Shemesh is associated with the return of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.
""We can read the Bible, we can study history, we can learn archaeology but when all of those three elements come together then we have the proof of that history and that historicity of the biblical text,"" Weiss told CBN News. ""So for us at the Bible Lands Museum, it's basically winning the lottery.""
Jar handles with royal seals, smashed figurines and other artifacts from the site are displayed in the exhibit. But there's more to the story.
""We walk the land and we're walking on top of history. The progress that is required to build a new nation with housing and roads and infrastructure requires digging down and building new things,"" Weiss said.
Modern-day Beit Shemesh is about 20 miles outside Jerusalem. It has a population of more than 110,000 and is growing fast.
""It's complicated because I want to protect the road. I want to protect the Tel, the site and I need to find the way to protect both of them. It's very important for everybody,"" Beit Shemesh Mayor Aliza Bloch told CBN News.
Archaeologists and developers knew they had to work together.
""The reality is that people need homes and roads to be created and there's this balance, there's this debate in how do we do it,"" Weiss said.
So they came up with a compromise plan to alter the road and still preserve the historical site with the hope of developing the past for future generations."

Wallace and Christine are a father/daughter team at a successful financial planning firm in Tampa, Florida. Both enjoy being partners at the firm.
“Seeing the clients at different stages of their lives and helping them through some of the choices that they need to make. We know we did our job and we took care of them and they’re thankful. It’s just a very rewarding profession,” says Christine.
Christine is married with a family of her own now. But as a child, she remembers learning important lessons from her parents, including about tithing and giving. She noticed when they shared stories that she couldn’t explain as a coincidence. Like the time her father pledged to give $1000 that he didn’t have.
Wallace says, “About two weeks later, I received a commission on an investment that I was unaware the gentleman was going to invest in that way. And it came out that I had a commission of approximately $1000. So, it was returned! The more we are blessed, the more we can give. And it's more joyful to give than to receive.”
One of the places where Wallace and Christine give is CBN.
Christine says, “It’s phenomenal that they have the Well Project. It’s just a wonderful gift to those communities that are very remote.”
Wallace adds, “Operation Blessing is always there. The trucks roll and people are helped.”
“Helping the Home Front is a phenomenal new program with CBN. To work with these military families and encourage their faith!” says Christine.
“Superbook, I am very impressed with the spreading of the gospel throughout the world,” says Wallace.
“Orphan's Promise is doing a beautiful job of helping these orphans that otherwise would be left and instead, now they're chosen,” says Christine.
This father/daughter team plans on continuing to give to CBN for a long time to come.
Christine says, “The gift is in the giving. The gift is for the giver. It's not about the organization that's asking for the funds. It's about doing the right thing that the Lord has put on your heart to do. It’s important to open your mind and open your pocketbook and let the Lord in, because He's an amazing God.” Show Guest Bio:"

The attorney general of Montana has invited Chick-fil-A to open more restaurants in his state after two other states have taken actions to block the food chain over its biblical values.
With Chick-fil-A under fire, Montana Republican Tim Fox wrote, ""Politicians in some states may think it's okay to discriminate against others based on their religious views. That's not how we do things in Montana.""
Chick-fil-A currently has only one restaurant in Montana.
Fox is running for governor next year. His comments came after the city council in San Antonio, Texas voted late last week against reconsidering its decision to block the restaurant from its contract at the city's airport.
Most recently, Chick-fil-A came under fire for making charitable donations to organizations with Christian beliefs like Salvation Army and Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Liberals claim that's proof that Chick-fil-A is anti-gay, even though none of those organizations is anti-gay.
""While some have questioned the motives behind our donations, we want to take a moment to reiterate the mission and focus of the Chick-fil-A Foundation, which has always been and always will be to donate to programs that support a diverse array of youth and educational programs nationwide,"" the company responded in a statement.

Sri Lanka Says Easter Attack Leader Died in Hotel Bombing,www1.cbn.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/sri-lanka-says-easter-attack-leader-died-in-hotel-bombing,"Sri Lanka Says Easter Attack Leader Died in Hotel Bombing 04-26-2019 Associated Press Sri Lanka Attack (Photo: Screen Capture)
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) - The suspected leader of the militant group Sri Lankan authorities said carried out a series of Easter Sunday bombings died in the blast at the Shangri-La hotel, one of six hotels and churches targeted in the attacks that killed at least 250 people, officials said Friday. Police said on an official Twitter account that Mohamed Zahran, the leader of local militant group National Towheed Jamaat known for his vitriolic extremist speeches on social media, had been killed in one of the nine suicide bombings. Police also said they had arrested the group's second-in-command. They said investigators had determined that the assailants' military training was provided by someone they called ""Army Mohideen,"" and that weapons training had taken place overseas and at some locations in Sri Lanka's Eastern Province. Police also said that the attackers had worked out at a local gym and by playing soccer using their authentic national identity cards. They added that the vehicles used in the attack were purchased from a car dealership in Kadawatha, a suburb of Colombo, the capital. They said that the operator of a copper factory who was arrested in connection with the bombings had helped Mohideen make improvised explosive devices and purchase empty cartridges sold by the Sri Lankan military as scrap copper. Australia's prime minister said earlier Friday that it had been confirmed that the Sri Lanka attackers were supported by the Islamic State group, which has claimed responsibility for the massacre, distributing video of Zahran and others pledging allegiance to the withered caliphate. Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena told reporters in Colombo that some 140 people in the island nation had been identified as having links to the Islamic State group, and that the Sri Lankan government has ""the capability ""to completely control ISIS activities"" in the country. ""We will completely control this and create a free and peaceful environment for people to live,"" he said. Sirisena blamed Sri Lanka's defense secretary, who resigned Thursday, and police chief, who he said would soon step down, for a failure to share weeks of information from international intelligence agencies about the plot ahead of time. Across Colombo, there was a visible increase of security as authorities warned of another attack and pursued suspects that could have access to explosives. Authorities had told Muslims to pray at home rather than attend communal Friday prayers that are the most important religious service for the faithful. At one mosque in Colombo where prayers were still held, police armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles stood guard outside. Armed soldiers also stood guard outside St. Anthony's Shrine, one of the three churches attacked on Easter. Gration Fernando crossed himself when he looked at the church after walking out of his shop there. Fernando says he, like other Sri Lankans, was worried about further attacks. There is ""no security, no safety to go to church,"" he said, adding that ""now children are scared to go to church"" as well. Late on Thursday, Sri Lanka's health ministry drastically revised down its estimated death toll from the coordinated attacks. A statement said ""approximately"" 253 people had died, nearly one-third lower than the police's estimated death toll of 359. The discrepancy was not immediately explained, but it fit a pattern of claims and counterclaims by Sri Lankan officials that have muddled the investigation. In a predominantly Muslim area of Colombo's Maligawatta neighborhood, vegetable sellers laid their produce on the sidewalks near the mosques as women in long black chador shopped. Leaders at the neighborhood mosques said they planned still to hold Friday noon prayers. They said both the police and volunteers would be guarding the neighborhood to protect the faithful. Imtiyas Ahamed, one prayer leader, said he planned to preach about how extremists like the Islamic State group were not faithful Muslims. ""In Islam, it is not said to kill yourself and kill others,"" Ahamed said. As he spoke, men one at a time came into the mosque to pray. They sat on their knees and bowed toward Mecca, the sweat from their brows falling on the mosque's purple-and-gray carpet. Abdullah Mohammed, 48, another Muslim from the neighborhood, stood outside. ""Everyone is nervous,"" Mohammed said. ""Not just the Muslims. Buddhists, Christians, Hindus - everybody's nervous."" Ahamed also urged people not to think all of Sri Lanka's Muslims were like the people who carried out Sunday's attacks. ""After the New Zealand attack, we don't think every white Australian is an extremist,"" he said. ___ Associated Press writers Bharatha Mallawarachi in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, contributed to this report.

Federal Judge Blocks Texas' Pro-Israel BDS Law,www1.cbn.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/federal-judge-blocks-texas-pro-israel-bds-law,"Federal Judge Blocks Texas' Pro-Israel BDS Law 04-26-2019 Emily Jones IsraelJudgeGavelAS
A US federal judge has blocked the enforcement of a Texas law that punishes contractors and businesses that support the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement (BDS).
The law, which was signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott in 2017, requires contractors to certify that they do not boycott the Jewish state. It prohibits all states agencies ""from contracting with, and certain public funds from investing in, companies that boycott Israel.
US District Judge Robert Pitman released an opinion Thursday delcaring that boycotts are protected speech and the law does not serve a compelling state interest.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas led the fight against the law and filed a federal lawsuit in December.
ACLU attorney Tommy Buser-Clancy called Judge Pitman's decision ""a victory for the free speech of all Texans. The right to boycott is deeply ingrained in American tradition, from our nation's founding to today.""
When Gov. Abbott signed the legislation into law in 2017, he said ""anti-Israel policies are anti-Texas policies, and we will not tolerate such actions against an important ally.""
Texas is one of 25 states to enact similar bans on the BDS movement."
Biden's 'America Is Coming Back' Kick-Off Earns 'Old Guard' Label from Liberal Democrats,www1.cbn.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/bidens-america-is-coming-back-kick-off-earns-old-guard-label-from-liberal-democrats,"Joe Biden (Photo: AP Photo) 6030285061001 Biden's 'America Is Coming Back' Kick-Off Earns 'Old Guard' Label from Liberal Democrats
WASHINGTON – Joe Biden is a front runner among Democratic primary candidates, but holding on to his lead may prove to be the greatest fight of his life.
The former vice president seemed right at home as a visited a pizza joint in Delaware in his first campaign stop Thursday, greeted by a throng of reporters. But liberal voters will have to wait to find out where he stands on a slew of issues like ""Medicare for All,"" the ""Green New Deal"" and socialism in America.
""I gotta go,"" Biden said, delaying tough questions.
"" Justice Democrats ,"" a group aligned with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), labeled Biden part of the ""old guard"" warning his centrist ideas could ""divide the party"" and suppress liberal enthusiasm.
On day one of his campaigns, his message sounded a lot like President Trump's slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""
""America is coming back like we used to be: ethical, straight, telling the truth, moving in a way, supporting our allies - all those good things,"" he told a reporter outside the pizza shop.
On Twitter, President Trump dubbed Biden ""Sleepy Joe"" and warned him in the primary, he'll be ""dealing with people who truly have some very sick and demented ideas."" Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe. I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign. It will be nasty - you will be dealing with people who truly have some very sick & demented ideas. But if you make it, I will see you at the Starting Gate!

Later on Fox News, the president said, ""I've known Joe over the years. He's not the brightest light bulb in the group, I don't think, but he has a name that they know.""
Name recognition, he has – money, he does not. That's a problem considering Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) is sitting on a war chest of more than $26 million as he works to rally Democrats to support his socialist agenda. ""Our job is not just to win the White House, it is to transform the economy and government of this country,"" he said during a rally this week.
For Biden to beat Bernie and the other 18 candidates he'll have to answer for 45 years of votes, public statements and gaffes.
For example, in the 1970's he opposed school busing and racial quotas. In the 90's he was part of the tough-on-crime crowd, and as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he presided over the Anita Hill hearings. Those were controversial then and even more so today in the era of the MeToo movement.
Biden reached out to Hill in advance of his announcement, but Hill told the New York Times she was deeply unsatisfied with what he had to say.
Biden hits the campaign trail in earnest Monday with a stop in Pittsburgh.
""I think Joe Biden is probably the best Democratic candidate that they have right now. I'm a Republican but I think that if somebody is going to vote Democrat it's probably going to be Joe Biden,"" one voter tells a local TV affiliate.
Another voter says, ""I think his time is over for running for president. I think we need someone younger, someone with better ideas.""
In Pennsylvania, Biden will play up his reputation as a scrappy politician who tends to be popular among working-class voters, workers who are enjoying record low unemployment under President Trump.
As Biden left the Delaware pizza shop he said, ""See you guys, keep the faith."""
Biden's 'America Is Coming Back' Kick-Off Earns 'Old Guard' Label from Liberal Democrats,www.cbn.com,Jennifer Wishon,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/bidens-america-is-coming-back-kick-off-earns-old-guard-label-from-liberal-democrats,"WASHINGTON – Joe Biden is a front runner among Democratic primary candidates, but holding on to his lead may prove to be the greatest fight of his life.
The former vice president seemed right at home as a visited a pizza joint in Delaware in his first campaign stop Thursday, greeted by a throng of reporters. But liberal voters will have to wait to find out where he stands on a slew of issues like ""Medicare for All,"" the ""Green New Deal"" and socialism in America.
""I gotta go,"" Biden said, delaying tough questions.
"" Justice Democrats ,"" a group aligned with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), labeled Biden part of the ""old guard"" warning his centrist ideas could ""divide the party"" and suppress liberal enthusiasm.
On day one of his campaigns, his message sounded a lot like President Trump's slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""
""America is coming back like we used to be: ethical, straight, telling the truth, moving in a way, supporting our allies - all those good things,"" he told a reporter outside the pizza shop.
On Twitter, President Trump dubbed Biden ""Sleepy Joe"" and warned him in the primary, he'll be ""dealing with people who truly have some very sick and demented ideas.""
Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe. I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign. It will be nasty - you will be dealing with people who truly have some very sick & demented ideas. But if you make it, I will see you at the Starting Gate!

Sri Lanka Says Easter Attack Leader Died in Hotel Bombing,www.cbn.com,Associated Press,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/sri-lanka-says-easter-attack-leader-died-in-hotel-bombing,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) - The suspected leader of the militant group Sri Lankan authorities said carried out a series of Easter Sunday bombings died in the blast at the Shangri-La hotel, one of six hotels and churches targeted in the attacks that killed at least 250 people, officials said Friday.
Police said on an official Twitter account that Mohamed Zahran, the leader of local militant group National Towheed Jamaat known for his vitriolic extremist speeches on social media, had been killed in one of the nine suicide bombings.
Police also said they had arrested the group's second-in-command.
They said investigators had determined that the assailants' military training was provided by someone they called ""Army Mohideen,"" and that weapons training had taken place overseas and at some locations in Sri Lanka's Eastern Province.
Police also said that the attackers had worked out at a local gym and by playing soccer using their authentic national identity cards. They added that the vehicles used in the attack were purchased from a car dealership in Kadawatha, a suburb of Colombo, the capital.
They said that the operator of a copper factory who was arrested in connection with the bombings had helped Mohideen make improvised explosive devices and purchase empty cartridges sold by the Sri Lankan military as scrap copper.
Australia's prime minister said earlier Friday that it had been confirmed that the Sri Lanka attackers were supported by the Islamic State group, which has claimed responsibility for the massacre, distributing video of Zahran and others pledging allegiance to the withered caliphate.
Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena told reporters in Colombo that some 140 people in the island nation had been identified as having links to the Islamic State group, and that the Sri Lankan government has ""the capability ""to completely control ISIS activities"" in the country.
""We will completely control this and create a free and peaceful environment for people to live,"" he said.
Sirisena blamed Sri Lanka's defense secretary, who resigned Thursday, and police chief, who he said would soon step down, for a failure to share weeks of information from international intelligence agencies about the plot ahead of time.
Across Colombo, there was a visible increase of security as authorities warned of another attack and pursued suspects that could have access to explosives. Authorities had told Muslims to pray at home rather than attend communal Friday prayers that are the most important religious service for the faithful. At one mosque in Colombo where prayers were still held, police armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles stood guard outside.
Armed soldiers also stood guard outside St. Anthony's Shrine, one of the three churches attacked on Easter.
Gration Fernando crossed himself when he looked at the church after walking out of his shop there. Fernando says he, like other Sri Lankans, was worried about further attacks.
There is ""no security, no safety to go to church,"" he said, adding that ""now children are scared to go to church"" as well.
Late on Thursday, Sri Lanka's health ministry drastically revised down its estimated death toll from the coordinated attacks. A statement said ""approximately"" 253 people had died, nearly one-third lower than the police's estimated death toll of 359.
The discrepancy was not immediately explained, but it fit a pattern of claims and counterclaims by Sri Lankan officials that have muddled the investigation.
In a predominantly Muslim area of Colombo's Maligawatta neighborhood, vegetable sellers laid their produce on the sidewalks near the mosques as women in long black chador shopped.
Leaders at the neighborhood mosques said they planned still to hold Friday noon prayers. They said both the police and volunteers would be guarding the neighborhood to protect the faithful.
Imtiyas Ahamed, one prayer leader, said he planned to preach about how extremists like the Islamic State group were not faithful Muslims.
""In Islam, it is not said to kill yourself and kill others,"" Ahamed said.
As he spoke, men one at a time came into the mosque to pray. They sat on their knees and bowed toward Mecca, the sweat from their brows falling on the mosque's purple-and-gray carpet.
Abdullah Mohammed, 48, another Muslim from the neighborhood, stood outside.
""Everyone is nervous,"" Mohammed said. ""Not just the Muslims. Buddhists, Christians, Hindus - everybody's nervous.""
Ahamed also urged people not to think all of Sri Lanka's Muslims were like the people who carried out Sunday's attacks.
""After the New Zealand attack, we don't think every white Australian is an extremist,"" he said.

Federal Judge Blocks Texas' Pro-Israel BDS Law,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/federal-judge-blocks-texas-pro-israel-bds-law,"A US federal judge has blocked the enforcement of a Texas law that punishes contractors and businesses that support the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement (BDS).
The law, which was signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott in 2017, requires contractors to certify that they do not boycott the Jewish state. It prohibits all states agencies ""from contracting with, and certain public funds from investing in, companies that boycott Israel.
US District Judge Robert Pitman released an opinion Thursday delcaring that boycotts are protected speech and the law does not serve a compelling state interest.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas led the fight against the law and filed a federal lawsuit in December.
ACLU attorney Tommy Buser-Clancy called Judge Pitman's decision ""a victory for the free speech of all Texans. The right to boycott is deeply ingrained in American tradition, from our nation's founding to today.""
When Gov. Abbott signed the legislation into law in 2017, he said ""anti-Israel policies are anti-Texas policies, and we will not tolerate such actions against an important ally.""
Texas is one of 25 states to enact similar bans on the BDS movement."
"'God Was Definitely With Us': Family Prayer Answered Amid Tornado, Churches Help Rebuild",www1.cbn.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/god-was-definitely-with-us-family-prayer-answered-amid-tornado-churches-help-rebuild,"'God Was Definitely With Us': Family Prayer Answered Amid Tornado, Churches Help Rebuild 04-26-2019 Christian Ellis Storm (Photo: Screen Capture)
Severe weather, including several tornadoes, have ripped a path of destruction across the South killing at least five people.
A twister tore the roof off a barn with its powerful winds in Ohio. Multiple tornadoes touched down in Louisiana in towns of Converse and Ruston.
A pastor's wife and her son encountered Converse's tornado at their church parsonage. They began to pray for protection as their house was shaking when a pine and oak tree fell on the ground, missing their house by one foot.
""God was definitely with us last night,"" stated Dawn, the mother, according to Baptist Message. ""I normally don't get scared, but last night felt different. Noah was a rock; he was more calm than me. He said 'Mama let's pray.' So we did.""
They are grateful to the Lord as their lives were spared and their church only had a broken window.
""When things like this happen, you remember what is important,"" Dawn said. ""Don't sweat the small stuff.""
In the small town of Ruston, a 136 mph tornado struck with deadly force. A different mother and son were killed there, and prayers are being requested for their heartbroken family.
Local churches are working to help those affected by the storm. Rolling Hills Ministry Disaster Relief team members prepared meals for those who were impacted.
And Foundry Church in Sterlington has been collecting tarps while First West and Christ Church have partnered to send cleanup crews into neighborhoods.
Louisiana Gov. Jon Bel Edwards, who has declared a state of emergency, has praised the faith-based community for helping with clean-up.
""What we've seen up to now in the Ruston area and really all across the state of Louisiana has been Louisianans stepping up and doing what they do best and that is being neighbor to one another,"" stated Edwards. ""Especially the faith based community has been tremendous, the number of groups that are here cooking for first responders and for those whose homes have been damaged."""
"US Economy Grew at Strong 3.2% Rate in First Quarter, Exceeding Expectations",www1.cbn.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/us-economy-grew-at-strong-3-2-rate-in-first-quarter-exceeding-expectations,"US Economy Grew at Strong 3.2% Rate in First Quarter, Exceeding Expectations 04-26-2019 Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. economy grew at a solid 3.2% annual rate in the first three months of the year, a far better outcome than expected, overcoming a host of headwinds including global weakness, rising trade tensions and a partial government shutdown.
The advance in the gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic health, marks an acceleration from a 2.2% gain in the previous October-December period, the Commerce Department reported Friday. However, about half the gain reflected two factors not expected to last - a big jump stockpiling by businesses and a sharp contraction in the trade deficit.
Still, the GDP gain surpassed the 3% bar set by President Donald Trump as evidence his economic program is working. Trump is counting on a strong economy as he campaigns for re-election.
It was the strongest first quarter growth rate since 2015. In recent years, GDP has been exceptionally weak in the first quarter. There had been fears growth could dip below 1% this year due to a variety of adverse factors such as the December stock market nosedive, rising weakness in key economies overseas, the U.S. trade war with China and a 35-day partial government shutdown that ended in January.
But the economy shrugged off those concerns, helped by an announcement in early January from the Federal Reserve that after raising rates four times last year, it was declaring a pause on further rate hikes. That spurred a stock market rebound by easing concerns that the central bank might overdo its credit tightening and send the country into a recession.
Still, economists believe the current April-June quarter will not match the first quarter's performance. Many are looking for GDP growth to slow to around 2% in the current quarter.
In the first quarter, inventory rebuilding added 0.7 percentage point to growth, while a falling trade deficit boosted growth by a full percentage point. Analysts think both of those factors will reverse in the current quarter.
Consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of economic activity, slowed to growth at a rate of just 1.2% in the first quarter. In particular, spending on durable goods fell at a rate of 5.3%, the biggest decline in a decade, led by a sharp drop in light truck sales.
Government spending was up 2.4% as a big 3.9% gain in state and local spending, reflecting increases in highway construction, offset a flat performance for the federal government. The government estimated that the 35-day partial federal shutdown trimmed 0.3 percentage point from growth in the first quarter after trimming fourth quarter growth by 0.1 percentage point.
For the year, economists believe GDP will expand 2.4%, down from last year's 2.9% gain, as the boost from the 2017 tax cuts and increased government spending over the past two years start to fade.
The consensus view of private forecasters is well below expectations of the Trump administration which contends that its economic policies have broken a decade-long period when GDP gains averaged 2.2% annually. The administration is predicting growth will top 3% in coming years.
There are factors that could help lift growth in coming quarters. The global economy appears on better footing, given improvements in such major economies as China, and a trade war between the world's two largest economies that appears closer to being resolved than it did at the start of the year.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said he expects growth for this year to be around 2.2%, close to the average for the past 10 years.
""We got a temporary boost to growth last year because of the tax cuts but that money has been spent so we are back to the kind of growth we have had,"" Zandi said. ""I think we are back to the 2% world we have been in since the recession ended.""
The current recovery from the Great Recession of 2007-2009 is currently the second longest in history and will become the longest if it lasts past June.
But it has also been the slowest in the post-World War II period, a development economists attribute to slower growth in the labor force and weak gains in productivity.
