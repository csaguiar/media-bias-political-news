CARACAS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 07th April, 2019) The mechanism set up by Mexico , Bolivia , Uruguay and Caribbean nations to try to find a way out of the Venezuelan crisis is the only one acting in good faith, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said Sunday .
""The Montevideo Mechanism ( Uruguay , Mexico , CARICOM and Bolivia ) is the most sincere and rigorous initiative that has been proposed. President Nicolas Maduro called for its activation yesterday. Dialogue and politics are always the way to go. There is no place for war and violence in Venezuela ,"" he tweeted.
The initiative was unveiled at a Montevideo summit in February . The stakeholders proposed a four-step plan, including the launch of immediate dialogue followed by further negotiations, the drafting of an agreement on how to end the crisis and its implementation. Moscow , which backs Maduro, approved of this plan.
Venezuela has been gripped by unrest since Maduro was sworn in as president for a second term in January . This prompted US-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido to declare himself interim president and promise a snap election . He was recognized by Washington and its allies in the region and in Europe ."

I'm sorry you haven't found it if you really are ex-Mil. I don't know what kind of symbolism you are intimating. But I have to tell you, there is more love of America in Pepeland than there has been in the MSM in many a year.
And as to why you never saw this in your service, there are some patriots who do not fit the conventional mold. That does not diminish their love of country. Some patriots are not cut out for military life, that does not diminish their patriotism. Some Americans may have a different way of processing information from the rest of US, and these PATRIOTS found their niche in Pepeland. Were it not for the Pepes, I might still be looking for a new place to call home, instead of coming back and fighting for the one I already have.
