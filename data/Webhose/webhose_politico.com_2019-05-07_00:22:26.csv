Reparations, Medicare for all, take care of all the immigrants. guaranteed income even if you don't work. I don't think there are enough millionaires and billionaires to tax at 70% to take care of this foolishness. Remember the debt is currently $22 Trillion that during Obama it doubled from $10 Trillion to $20 trillion. That is $1.25 trillion each year. Currently during Trump's presidency the debt has increased $2 trillion and that is less that $1 trillion each year. Going the right direction but needs to be a reduction and not an increase. This is what Washington needs to work on. Not bring up bogus accusations with definitely no proof of anything wrong. IRS approved Trumps taxes or he would be in jail and remember IRS wanted to deny Republican groups tax exempt status that they were eligible to have so IRS is definitely not siding with Trump because his taxes are in order."

No. Simply throwing money to the descendant's of a historical injustice does nothing to make better their societal conditions today, and will most probably create a backlash effect on top of it. From 1619 on Black natives were captured in Africa and sold by White's into slavery in America. Starting about the same time, American Indians began to experience a near-total genocide from the same Whites as the Indian lands were stolen. Do they deserve reparations for what was done to them? Yes. In the 1800's Chinese laboror's worked the California goldfield's that funded the civil war, then built the railroads through to the West, before being brutilized & killed off when not needed anymore. Do they deserve reparations? Yes. Will any of these monies change the past? No. Instead of just sending a check, wouldn't it make more sense to begin a federal program where all citizens, whose ancestors were in some way wrongly victimized by White people in the past, receive a ""formal government apology"" and - Basic Guaranteed Income for Life - where ALL CITIZEN'S OF ALL COLORS in this country receive the same? Slavery was legitmized in the Constitution. Genocide of the Indians was legitimized by a Federal Policy of extermination. The Chinese suffered at the hands of mob's & individuals, but the ""Chinese Exclusion Act"" legitimized it. We can't simply ""pay off"" one group without paying off the others. And if White citizenry is left out we'll see backlash, like it or not. The Irish suffered, the Italians suffered, the Jews suffered. If we do it for one - we must for all. A Guaranteed Minimum Income is the only way!"

Although he labels it “Democratic Socialism” (like the Social Democrats in Germany), it is actually a misnomer, for contrary to what is published into most media outlets, Democratic Socialism is NOT the Stalinism of the old USSR, in which the state controls all enterprises, but a highly regulated form of Capitalism. Average people in Sweden, for example, are taxed at rates similar to the US (33% on incomes up to 55k), but without the extreme corruption of our system (lobbyists don’t write their legislation) and a much more efficient allocation of resources, that country (which also pays for its own military and is not a member of NATO but works closely with that organization) is able to provide excellent universal healthcare, nursing home and childcare, a living wage (their citizens don’t have to work two or three jobs to afford shelter), and all employers provide month long (or more) paid vacation and their university students don’t graduate with the crushing debt that is quite common here. Medical bankruptcy is nonexistent (over four million cases in the US last year) and the standard of living much higher - that’s why none of my relatives in Sweden (including most of their compatriots as President Trump once noted) want to emigrate to the US...."

According to one Fox News economist, about 70 percent of businesses are in private hands. It is a mixed economy and was intentionally NOT based on the old Soviet model where the state controls all means of production because as Castro famously told Chavez, it is “not 1960 anymore” and he, interestingly, urged him to keep the majority of businesses under private ownership (even Cuba now allows small businesses like beauty shops to operate). Corruption and mismanagement have plagued the country under both right and left leaning governments, but it was the huge drop in oil prices which set the stage for the hyperinflation Venezuela now struggles with. Chavez had initially set up a sovereign wealth fund to help Venezuela deal with the boom and bust cycle of the energy business but then dismantled it when oil prices skyrocketed, and everyone thought that with “peak oil”, prices would continue to escalate. This mistake combined with Venezuela’s reliance on the sale of oil for the majority of its revenue and more recently, the crippling economic sanctions, have all contributed to the crisis it now faces. I have visited Venezuela, and it is a beautiful country with a vibrant culture, and I’m a big fan of their innovative El Sistema music education system (I regularly perform with a superb musician from Venezuela who was trained under this program) so fervently hope that there will be a negotiated rather than a military solution. There is a great deal of propaganda being broadcast about Venezuela in the MSM (one lie is that everyone is against Maduro - his base of support, as a percentage of the population, is larger than that of President Trump and unlike our leader, he did win with a majority of the popular vote and was willing to have U.N. observers monitor the elections which the opposition refused to allow). Many of those countries which we consider to be “friendly” like Saudi Arabia are far more extreme than Venezuela and yet there is no talk of “regime change” for a nation whose citizens perpetrated the worst attack on the US since Pearl Harbor, murdered an American journalist and cut him up with a bone saw before he died, forbids their citizens to vote for their own leader, and has many barbaric practices including stoning people to death and the routine use of torture"

Here in the Carolinas, Tyson Foods was fined for such practices, and one manager who hired them even committed suicide over this egregious practice. Predatory Capitalism has a terrible history of exploiting people (slavery is one example - not only plantation owners but those who shipped them made huge fortunes) and is primarily responsible for the large numbers of “illegal” workers living here, many of whom come from Mexico and Central America to toil on farms, in hotels (like those owned by Trump and many other oligarchs), for landscaping companies, in meat processing plants, etc...."
