Your personal information has had a tough start to 2019, with data breaches reported at Facebook, Toyota, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Earls Enterprises, parent company of Planet Hollywood.
In what is quickly becoming a familiar tale, personal information of millions of users — or over half a billion, in the latest Facebook security gaffe — is taken from companies, businesses that people trust. Advertisement:
Toyota
The latest round of bad news began in late-March, when Toyota announced through its Japanese newsroom that hackers gained ""unauthorized access to the network,"" which led to customer data belonging to eight subsidiaries across Japan being stolen. The subsidiaries include Lexus, the luxury car making division of Toyota.
Toyota says up to 3.1 million ""items of customer information may have been leaked outside the company,"" but said this does not include credit card information.
What's especially interesting is that this is far from an isolated incident for Toyota. A day later, the car maker's Vietnam and Thailand subsidiaries made separate statement to say they too had been victim of suspected cyber attacks. These all come after Toyota Australia said in February it too had been the victim of an attempted cyber attack, although in this case no data was successfully stolen.
Despite the scale and apparent seriousness of such hacking attempts, consumers generally do not feel threatened by such cyber attacks, even on companies they deal with and which hold their personal and financial information. After all, it is widely understood that victims of cyberattacks who are unfortunate enough to lose money via their credit card details being stolen, can report the crime and in most cases have their funds quickly returned.
This disinterested is echoed by a stock market which mostly understands that companies quickly recover from cyber attacks, security gaffes, and the negative PR they create — just look at Facebook's share price, which hit heavy turbulence in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal in early-2018, but has now almost recovered to its pre-scandal level. It even spiked to a record-high in the summer, before tumbling some more, then bouncing back again in early 2019. Advertisement:
When it comes to the damage caused by cyber crime and the irresponsible use of customer data, Wall Street has a short memory and is quick to forgive.
This is reflected by a research paper, Cyber Attacks and Stock Market Activity , published in June 2018 by Daniele Bianchi of the University of Warwick, UK, and Onur Kemal Tosun, of Cardiff Business School, UK. Studying how financial markets react to unexpected corporate security breaches in the short- and long-term, the pair wrote: ""Interestingly...for target firms both CEO total pay and incentive pay tend to increase several years after a security breach compared to control firms.""
The paper also discovered that, because a victim of cyber attack invests to prevent future breaches, there is no evidence of an uptick in staff being fired after an attack, and ""there is no significant effect of hacking on firms' operating performance in the long-term.""
Earl Enterprises Advertisement:
The next victim to come clean about being the victim of a cyber attack was Earl Enterprises, parent company of the Planet Hollywood, Buca di Beppo and Earl of Sandwich restaurant chains. In this case, point-of-sale malware was used to take credit card details as customers paid for their meal.
The data included customer names, plus credit card names and expiry dates, and while the company did not say how many people were affected, KrebsOnSecurity puts the figure at more than two million. This data was offered for sale online in February, and had been collected by the malware between May 2018 and March 2019 — a 10-month cyber security breach. Earl Enterprises admitted what had happened on March 29 .
How to protect yourself Advertisement:
Again, while this sounds serious — and the security breach remained live for a worrying amount of time — there is little the consumer need worry about, and little they could have done to protect themselves from malware installed on Earl's payment system.
As cyber security Brian Krebs wrote in his reporting of the incident, it is important to keep a close eye on your credit card bills. ""Cardholders are not responsible for fraudulent charges, but your bank isn't always going to detect card fraud. That's why it's important to regularly review your monthly statements and quickly report any unauthorized charges.""
Of course, you could always pay with cash to avoid using the card reader entirely. Advertisement:
Georgia Tech
Also a bringer of bad news this month was Georgia Tech, which announced on April 2 it had discovered the personal information of up to 1.3 million people — including current and former faculty, students, staff, and student applicants - had been unlawfully accessed. The university admitted the stolen data may include names, addresses, social security numbers and birth dates.
How to protect yourself
Victims will be offered access to a credit monitoring service, the university said, to help mitigate against potential damage — such as fraud via social engineering — caused by those who accessed the personal data. Advertisement:
As with most data breaches of this nature, victims are left to wait and see what damage, if any, will occur. Unlike the theft of a username and password for a social network, which can be quickly changed by the victim, stolen databases of names, addresses and social security numbers can be traded on the black market (often sold anonymously for bitcoin) then used to commit further crimes at a later date.
It is therefore tricky to to protect yourself from such a breach, other than to follow basic best-practice tips like never repeating passwords, and taking steps to protect yourself — ie, keep a close eye on your online accounts and finances.
Facebook
Finally, but by no means least, Facebook was once again creating headlines over irresponsible data practices. It was reported on April 3 that over 540 million Facebook records were left exposed on a publicly-accessible server. Advertisement:
The data was discovered on public Amazon cloud servers by researchers from IT firm UpGuard . The data included comments, likes, reactions, account names, Facebook IDs and more. A second dataset, linked to a Facebook-integrated and now defunct app called At The Pool, included Facebook user IDs, plus the users' likes, friends, photo, events, interests and plaintext password — that is, a password for At The Pool, rather than Facebook itself.
But this is not specifically the fault of Facebook alone. As cyber security expert Graham Cluley explains on his blog : ""[The data] was put there by third-party apps, whose apps integrated with Facebook. In short, Facebook allowed them to have access to the data, but then the third-parties were careless with it.""
Cluley added: ""There are a myriad of third-parties out there grabbing information via Facebook-integrated apps, and you have no way of knowing how well they are securing your data or — in many cases — what they might have taken at all.""
As UpGuard pointed out in a blog post , the public availability of that password ""would put users at risk who have reused the same password across accounts."" Advertisement:
In its criticism of Facebook's data security practises, the firm added: ""The Facebook platform facilitated the collection of data about individuals and its transfer to third parties [Amazon], who became responsible for its security.""
How to protect yourself
In this case, users are once again reminded to never use the same password twice, thus limiting their exposure to risk should one of their passwords be made public. You can use a password manager like LastPass or 1Password to create a unique password for everything you log into online. Managers also store them, saving you the need to remember anything apart from your one master password.
You should also consider locking down your Facebook account and restricting what apps, if any, can access your data through the social network. We wrote about this during the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, but here's a reminder of what to do to stay safe: Advertisement:"

""Saturday Night Live"" skewered former Vice President Joe Biden and his habit of being handsy around women in a recent sketch in which Jason Sudeikis returned in an impersonation that he made famous during President Barack Obama's administration.
""I'm a hugger, I'm a kisser and I'm a little bit of a sniffer,"" Sudeikis' Biden explains to a trio of consultants played by Kate McKinnon, Kenan Thompson and Cecily Strong, all of whom hope to get him to abandon his touchy-feely ways in order to be electable in 2020. They suggest that he interact with female voters who could conceivably support him in order to learn how to better handle himself. The seeming wisdom of their plan is reinforced when Sudeikis' Biden introduces himself to McKinnon's Gwen by leaning his forehead against hers and grabbing her arms. Advertisement:
When he is called out on that being inappropriate, Sudekis' Biden responds that ""I think nose-to-nose is gonna be okay"" because he is 1 percent ""Eskimo."" Later in the sketch he is told that he can't give up his habit of being handsy because ""that's like telling Mario Batali to take his crocs off,"" prompting one of the consultants to point out that ""I wouldn't bring him into this.""
On another occasion Sudeikis' Biden asks if a hand shake was all right. When he is told that it is, he follows up by asking, ""What about if during that handshake I tickle her palm a little bit?""
""That's not great. I would say no tickling at all,"" McKinnon replies.
The sketch concludes with Sudeikis' Biden meeting two female voters, played by Aidy Bryant and Leslie Jones. After being told that his attempt to hold Bryant's face is inappropriate, Sudeikis puts her in a headlock, prompting her to punch him in the stomach. Jones, on the other hand, identifies Biden as Obama's ""granddaddy"" and becomes touchy-feely with him — hugging and affectionately grabbing his posterior.
Perhaps the highlight of the sketch was when Biden was told that voters want him to defeat Trump, prompting him to ask if Trump is ""the guy who actually bragged about assault on tape?"" Cecily Strong replies by saying ""yes, yes but unlike his voters, your voters actually care."" Advertisement:
This point was reinforced in a different ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch, the ""Weekend Update"" segment with Colin Jost and Michael Che. In a joke referencing Biden's videotaped response to the accusations against him, Jost quipped that ""a pro-Trump group released a new ad saying that Biden’s behavior with women is unacceptable and should instantly disqualify him from running. The group’s name is Independent Republicans of New York, or IRONY."" Matthew Rozsa

Illinois manufacturing workers locked out and fired for one-hour strike,www.salon.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.salon.com/2019/04/07/illinois-manufacturing-workers-locked-out-and-fired-for-one-hour-strike_partner/,"Illinois manufacturing workers locked out and fired for one-hour strike The workers aren't unionized, but they are supported by Arise Chicago, a workers’ justice organization -- Your message has been sent successfully Send email to: //www.salon.com/2019/04/07/illinois-manufacturing-workers-locked-out-and-fired-for-one-hour-strike_partner/ Send This article originally appeared in In These Times .
As the sun was still rising last Friday morning, employees from Headly Manufacturing outside of Chicago participated in a 6:00 a.m. hour-long unfair labor practice strike. But when the approximately 25 workers tried to return to their jobs, they were locked out of the building, unable to complete what was many of their last days or collect their final paychecks.
According to a press release from the workers’ justice organization Arise Chicago, Headly had threatened individual employees that they would be fired, which inspired them to take collective action. Advertisement:
“We strike for ourselves because we don't have anything to support our families, because we need our jobs to put food on the table,” striking worker Mario Albor told In These Times. “Right now, we don't have jobs. We don't know what to do.”
For seven years, Albor has worked for the Broadview-based Headly Manufacturing, which produces precision-drawn metal stamps. He said he was laid off with many of his co-workers with no written explanation. Headly did not return phone and email requests for comment from In These Times.
Albor, who says he worked for the quality-control department, assumes Headly wants to rehire staffers without benefits like insurance and vacation that employees currently receive. Crain’s Chicago Business reported that recent job postings include slightly higher wages with fewer benefits.
The workers aren't unionized, but they are supported by Arise Chicago. They marked their strike with a large Arise Chicago banner stating, “Worker Rights = Immigrant Rights = Human Rights.”
“There was a lot of confusion going around, and the workers were scared that today was going to be their last day,” Shelly Ruzicka, communications director for Arise Chicago, told In These Times. She added, “The reason they did this together was so that it would be protected ‘concerted activity,’ trying to save their jobs saying that this supposed announcement of firing was unjust firing.”
After the shock of sudden unemployment, Albor said it felt good to fight for justice collectively. During the demonstration, Headly called the police, which delayed strikers’ ability to access their workplace, according to Albor. Albor said that when the police allowed them to make an unconditional return to work, they were locked out, a common practice in labor disputes. Co-director of the National Legal Advocacy Network Chris Williams, who is serving as the workers’ legal representative, corroborated Albor’s version of events. Advertisement:
“It's frustrating because we want answers,” Albor said. “And they're not willing to give us any answers or speak with us and they closed the door.”
Williams filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), arguing that the workers’ non-economic strike about discrimination and unfair treatment is protected under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the law governing private sector employees’ collective bargaining rights. He said this situation is a “pretty clear-cut violation” of NLRA Section 8(a)(1) prohibiting interference with the right to organize and Section 8(a)(3) concerning adverse actions like a lockout. He said it usually takes a few weeks to hear back from the NLRB about interviewing affected workers, but he is optimistic based on existing precedent.
“The Fight for $15 regularly holds short-term strikes on non-economic issues and [strikers] go back to work unconditionally,” he said. “The employer is not allowed to terminate people on that basis and they did in this case.”
While Albor hopes to get his job at Headly back, he’s already thinking about his future and the struggle to find a position with a similar salary and benefits. He and his wife had a baby four months ago and they own a home with a mortgage. Advertisement:
“They could at least pay us some money so we can support ourselves in the meantime until we find a new job,” he said. “Right now, we don't have money because they didn't give us our last paycheck and we still got to pay rent because bills won't wait.”
It’s a sentiment echoed by many striking Headly employees, some of whom have been with the company for over 20 years. Quoted in the Arise Chicago press release, worker Genaro Garcia said, “We have families to feed, and if we’re fired, now we’ll be short on funds and unable to support our families. We are demanding that the company keep us employed or minimally give us more notice in order to be able to look for new jobs. It’s not easy to find work.”
With both the University of Illinois at Chicago graduate workers and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on strike, Ruzicka of Arise Chicago is hopeful about the power of organized labor. “When workers take bold action, you can win,” she said. “We like to say when you strike, you win.” Advertisement:
She said an important lesson of Friday’s strike is even without the backing of a union, employees can still work together to advance their rights.
“We know a majority of workers in this country don't have a union,” she said. “It's very important that workers know even if you don't have a union you can still take collective action and you are protected. Better yet, organize and get union.” Related Topics"

Mulvaney added that Democrats will ""never"" see the tax returns and that Democrats ""know they're not going to"" get them. Last week, House Democrats formally requested Trump's tax returns . Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) asked IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to turn over six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns. He cited Section 6103, which permits Congress's tax committees to view tax information of any filer in a closed session. One of Trump's personal lawyers later urged the IRS not to release the returns, arguing that it would be illegal to do so. Luján added Sunday during his ""Fox News Sunday"" interview that ""no other president in modern time"" has had their returns requested under federal tax code ""because they’ve all voluntarily shared them."" ""President Trump promised as a candidate that he would share his tax returns. After he was elected, he promised he would share his tax returns with the American people. And he’s refused to do so,"" Luján said."

“The president and the Congress [have] legitimate authority, the question is whether we’re using that authority for legitimate purposes,” Kildee said. “Anybody who knows Donald Trump should be concerned about his abuse of authority.”
On Friday, an attorney for Trump wrote that Neal could not legally request Trump's tax returns until the IRS receives an opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.

Students Critical of University of Minnesota's Decision to Invite 'Green Book' Producer to Commencement,tennesseestar.com,Anthony Gockowski,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/students-critical-of-university-of-minnesotas-decision-to-invite-green-book-producer-to-commencement/ ,"The University of Minnesota’s College of Liberal Arts invited “Green Book” producer and university alumnus Jim Burke to deliver the keynote address for its commencement ceremony, but some students and faculty aren’t happy with the decision.
The movie was widely criticized for its use of racial slurs and for employing a “white savior” trope in which Viggo Mortensen’s character repeatedly gets co-star Mahershala Ali out of jams along their musical journey through the south in 1962.
To many’s dismay, the film managed to win best picture at the 2019 Academy Awards.
“‘Green Book’ is a white savior film. It allows and encourages a state of cognitive dissonance for white audiences between their perceived sense of self and racism,” Becca Mayo, a fifth-year student studying cinema and media culture, told the Minnesota Daily .
Department of Cultural Studies and Comparative Literature instructor Brad Stiffler said the movie’s main problem is “its depiction of interpersonal relationships as antidotes to racism,” saying it simplifies “systemic and institutional racial problems.”
“It’s something that this film especially seems to fall in that trap of reducing the complexity and the seriousness of race and race relations in the U.S. to this sort of caricatured idea of ‘Can these two people be friends or not?’” he said.
“It’s taking us back to a period in American racial history and racial conflict in the Civil Rights Movement that we kind of look back on and say, ‘Oh, we’ve come so far.’ It’s always about white salvation,” film studies coordinator Graeme Stout added, but said he wasn’t surprised that it won best picture.
“It’s a feel-good, happy film that suggests, ‘Hey, racism is over in an era of Donald Trump,’” he continued.
Another student criticized Burke for his involvement in the movie “The Descendants,” which is set in Hawaii, but didn’t include any native Hawaiians in its cast.
“I hope he sees the diverse graduating class our school has and tries to incorporate that diversity into future movies,” the student said.
Burke is listed as the keynote speaker for the College of Liberal Arts’ May 19 commencement.

Altruism is as an evolutionary adaptation that arises in the natural world. There are a plethora of examples. If altruism didn't arise from the natural world by way of observable processes, its presence among homo sapiens would make an excellent argument for the existence of a God. How else to account for it?
Ultimately, the process we're talking about shouldn't be controversial to capitalists and probably wouldn't be among libertarians if it weren't for some clinging to the notions of Ayn Rand. Libertarians have been writing about benevolence arising from markets since Adam Smith wrote about the invisible hand in 1759.
And who would argue that society at large doesn't benefit when people respect each other's rights?"

In case that was unclear, evolutionary processes are essentially market processes with specialization as a feature (as in ""specialization and exchange""). And we're not just talking about social adaptations if you imagine that's what altruism is about. Our neo-cortex evolved to leverage the advantages conferred by what you might think of as social adaptations, like language and religion."

The biggest obstacle keeping English colonists from pushing westward was the British crown. The colonists winning the American Revolution was probably the worst thing that could have happened to Native Americans. Wiping entire people's out and stealing their land has advantages.
It may be problematic, however, in maintaining whatever advantages societies get from genocidal theft without that cutting into the advantages of peaceful coexistence internally. Genocidal maniacs aren't typically good at respecting the rights of their people so that they can flourish."

Reparations Are More Likely to Divide the Nation Than Heal It Reason.com,reason.com,//,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/archives/2019/04/05/reparations-likely-to-divide-not-heal#comment_7748786,"This is a terrible way to close a financial gap. First of all, the financial gap is not race-based, it's how economic systems work. There has to be a financially underprivileged class otherwise nobody would do the shit work. Plenty of other races, including white people, are in the position of having to do shit work. It has nothing to do with race and everything to do with the folks who can afford half million dollar bribes to college admissions officials maintaining their elite status through any means afforded to them by their extant pile of money.
I reject the implied idea that white people have automatically benefited from the institution of slavery as a function of their race and black people did not. If there were benefits of slavery the institution, they would have been societal benefits that are not possible to withhold from modern non-slaves. For example, if slavery was used to build a road, everyone today uses that road to get places, regardless of skin tone. Any profits derived from slavery that launched or bolstered particular family dynasties would have had benefits limited to that particular family, and any that dissolved outward would have benefited all races.
So yeah, not in favor of reparations because it's a pretty obviously poor argument. It's really just a vote-buying scheme. Worse, it's a vote buying scheme that will never ever happen because it's such an objectively spectacularly bad idea."

Drug abuse seeps back into China today the same way it did when the British began marketing opium at huge profit in China back when.

(photo credit: Courtesy) UPGRADE YOUR JPOST EXPERIENCE FOR 5$ PER MONTH Show me later
It has been hard to keep up with Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked’s flurry of proposals for her legal revolution.The latest came last week when she appeared to call for house demolitions of Palestinians even before they have committed murder. As with many of her other recent-hastily tossed out proposals on major controversial issues, she did not give the standard detail which she is known for during non-election season.The Jerusalem Post has contacted her office numerous times regarding the following list of issues without getting promised responses.Was she proposing to demolish houses of Palestinians who have committed no crimes based on a “Minority Report” style analysis of what someone posted on social media to show the likelihood that they would have committed a crime?Was she proposing to demolish houses of Palestinians who are indicted for conspiracy to commit murder when caught after having bought weapons and assembled a terror attack plan, but before they carry it out?Or did she misspeak and was she simply trying to widen the category of Palestinian terrorists’ houses which get demolished? In that case, maybe she was copying MK Avi Dichter’s position that Palestinian houses should be demolished in cases of attempted stabbings and shootings which wounded, but which did not succeed in killing, the terrorist’s target.In the same appearance last week, Shaked complained of “mishpatizatzia” (over-legalization) of IDF conduct in dealing with conflict with the Palestinians.Shaked correctly noted that one of the reasons that the IDF has become more careful since 2009 in using force in low-grade conflict situations is because of pressure from the International Criminal Court in The Hague.Less clear was her proposal to replace the current approach to cope with the potential threat of ICC indictments and international arrest warrants against Israeli war decision-makers and IDF soldiers. Some 125 countries, including members of the EU, are treaty-bound by ICC arrest warrants.Israel’s current approach is to push the envelope on what international law of war appears to permit but to stay within certain limits and interpretations which it believes will keep the ICC from getting involved.If Israel takes an even more aggressive approach to using force which even the US army lawyers would not back and is not recognized by any international legal body, how would Shaked deal with the ICC? Israel might be able to get a respite with the Trump administration’s opposition to the ICC, but what happens with the next US president?It was also unclear on what basis she accused former chief justice Aharon Barak of responsibility for the IDF’s more restrictive rules of engagement since the major change has occurred since 2009, long after Barak’s retirement.Further, a 2014 Institute for National Security Studies journal article titled “Lawyers in war: Who needs them?”, by academic Ziv Bohrer notes that during the 1948-1949 War of Independence – with an IDF of some 70,000 soldiers – there were 2,424 courts martial, with an average of 400 cases per month. He said this shows that, even in Israel’s first war, lawyers and judges were heavily involved in regulating the army, “and yet Israel still managed to win!”Shaked’s statements that Barak caused the Basic Law legal revolution are accurate, but in the arena of the IDF there is no real evidence that he held the army back. In fact, he issued the initial decision permitting targeted killings.Earlier in election season, Shaked avoided answering questions about whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s attempt to fire his office’s legal adviser should change her view that legal advisers should become political appointments. Netanyahu’s legal adviser happens to have provided negative information about him and Sara to police when subpoenaed.Under the current system, legal advisers of ministries answer to Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit. The attorney-general blocked what appeared to be an attempt by Netanyahu to fire his legal adviser in retaliation for her being truthful to police about some of his and Sara’s conduct in the legal cases they face.If Shaked’s bill had been in effect to give ministers power over hiring their legal advisers, it is possible that Netanyahu could have fired his adviser without any oversight.Another question is where she and New Right Co-Party leader Naftali Bennett stand on the treatment of the Druze community (they are essentially omitted) by the Jewish Nation-State Law which was passed as a Basic Law having quasi-constitutional status.Long before elections, Bennett was the first in the government to admit that leaving out some special mention of the Druze community was a mistake or an oversight.However, when Blue and White leader Benny Gantz made one of his first public appearances in the election season calling for an amendment to the Jewish Nation-State Law to secure the Druze community’s special status, Shaked was one of the first to lash out and attack him as left-wing.Questioned about the seeming discrepancy, a spokesman for Shaked said Gantz was wrong to suggest that the specific fix for the Druze community needed to be done by amending the law. Rather, he said the fix might be done by passing a separate law or by a government policy decision.Pressed that the Druze community was unlikely to accept such a deal – a separate law, if it was not a Basic Law, as well as a government policy decision would both have an inferior status – the spokesman said they could connect the Post with Druze community representatives who would endorse this scenario off-record.No such representatives were produced, leaving question marks again about where Shaked stands on the Jewish Nation-State Law and the Druze community.Shaked has been very clear about one thing – altering the process for appointing Supreme Court justices to a Knesset-centered process with public hearings as in the US.There are differences. In the US, sometimes the Senate is from a different party than the president, which is a check on totally partisan appointments that Israel would not have if opposition votes were not required.But agree or disagree, the proposal itself is straightforward and clear.The question is how many of these half-baked proposals are election season fluff, versus how many could be real initiatives with the details being filled in after elections?

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will try to trick right-wing voters into leaving smaller parties for the Likud. This is the Union of Right-Wing Parties (URP) campaign message in the final days before the election.In a video released Sunday afternoon, MK Bezalel Smotrich released a video warning “we knew in advance they’ll come to drink [votes] with a straw.” Without referring to Netanyahu by name, Smotrich added: “Maybe he will start with a video to Ancient Shiloh and take a photo with the heads of local authorities [in Judea and Samaria] in his office. He will look us in the eyes and ask us to save the right-wing government. He will tell us how important we really are to him and will promise his first phone call [in forming a coalition] will be to us.“But you know, like I do, that right after the elections, it’ll disappear,” Smotrich warned.The MK also gave a warning against voting for the New Right without mentioning its leaders by name, saying that they will lament that they don’t have enough votes to get the defense portfolio.“There’s only one religious-Zionist party, so this time don’t get tempted... Stay home,” Smotrich said.The video is only one of several campaign messages and videos released by URP in recent days as an attempt to defend itself from a repeat of the 2015 elections, in which the Likud received 30 seats, far more than had been expected, but the other right-wing parties ended up smaller than predicted in most polls. בדרך לפגישה הבהולה עם ראש הממשלה, מציע לראשי הראשויות ביו״ש לקחת שלוק מהמיץ גזר.הפעם הציונות הדתית לא תהיה פרייארית ולא תקנה את המניפולציות שמפעילים עליה.הפעם מצביעים רק 'טב' לאיחוד מפלגות הימין. pic.twitter.com/Up8IIBvvJd — בצלאל סמוטריץ' (@bezalelsm) April 7, 2019 “It’s amazing how Netanyahu is working exactly according to his [tactic] that everyone knew was coming in advance,” Smotrich wrote on Twitter on Friday. “Except this time, unlike in the last election, he’s playing with fire, and this fire can devour the entire right-wing bloc. We cannot fall for this manipulation.”URP also sent volunteers to intersections and city centers with the message that they are the party for religious Zionists.The signs the bloc hung up around the country all talk about the party’s “commitments”– to Torah, to settlements, to Jewish identity and to “more”– a thinly veiled criticism of New Right leaders Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked for leaving Bayit Yehudi, one of the party’s making up URP.“There will be a lot of spin in the coming days, everyone will try to drink up our votes with different arguments, but it won’t work. The public won’t let the lying spin make religious Zionism disappear,” the party’s spokesman said.Meanwhile, the New Right has mostly stuck to issues-based messages, though they’ve used humor to convey their messages.On Saturday night, the party released a video of Shaked singing and Bennett playing the piano and rapping about a divorce between the High Court and the IDF.“I’ve done you harm for too many years / We tried together until we were tired / We were weak against Hamas,” Shaked sang, as the voice of the High Court.Another video featured Bennett holding a dove and explaining that he wants peace, but only if it comes in the right way.“You know what your problem is?” Bennett asks the white dove. “Insecurity. You compromise, you yield, you are naive. That is not how peace is made. Because of you we almost lost our hope. Now, lift up your head. Remember that you are right. Fight, win, give them a real battle – and then, and only then, they will beg you to make peace.”On Saturday, Yisrael Beytenu leader Avigdor Liberman also sent the message that it’s important to strengthen the right-wing bloc. “The next government will be right-wing,” he said on Saturday. “The right-wing bloc is strong with 67-68 seats and we will only join a right-wing government.”

Lawmaker alleges political payback in failed 'deepfakes' measure,thehill.com,thoman@thehill.com (Olivia Beavers),04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/437490-lawmaker-alleges-political-payback-in-failed-deepfakes-measure,"Lawmaker alleges political payback in failed 'deepfakes' measure By Olivia Beavers - 04/05/19 06:00 AM EDT
A congressional push to examine the threat of so-called deepfake videos was derailed last year after a key House lawmaker blocked a measure that would have provided government funding to study the insidious technology.
A bipartisan group of House lawmakers — Reps. Stephanie Murphy Carlos Luis Curbelo Hillicon Valley — Presented by CTIA and America's wireless industry — Lawmaker sees political payback in fight over 'deepfakes' measure | Tech giants to testify at hearing on 'censorship' claims | Google pulls the plug on AI council Lawmaker alleges political payback in failed 'deepfakes' measure Ex-GOP lawmaker joins marijuana trade group MORE (R-Fla.) — sought to add an amendment to the 2019 Intelligence Authorization Act that would have allowed the use of federal funds to research the threat posed by fake but believable content . ADVERTISEMENT
The amendment would have required the director of national intelligence to submit a written report to congressional intelligence panels detailing the impact deepfake technology could have on national security, as well as technologies that could effectively deter or detect such technology, according to a copy of the text obtained by The Hill.
But the amendment was unexpectedly killed by then-House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions Peter Anderson Sessions Hillicon Valley — Presented by CTIA and America's wireless industry — Lawmaker sees political payback in fight over 'deepfakes' measure | Tech giants to testify at hearing on 'censorship' claims | Google pulls the plug on AI council Lawmaker alleges political payback in failed 'deepfakes' measure As Russia collusion fades, Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges MORE (R-Texas) for reasons that are unclear.
Murphy and two GOP sources familiar with the matter now allege that Sessions, who lost his bid for reelection in the 2018 midterms, spiked the amendment out of political consideration and loyalty to his friend, former Rep. John Mica
“I found it unconscionable that he would punish a friend’s rival,” Murphy told The Hill, calling it a “serious mistake.”
“Obviously, I was disappointed to see politics play a role in national security,” she added.
Murphy claims Sessions killed the bill either on Mica’s behalf or because he didn’t want to let her have a “win.”
“That kind of retribution is what makes this environment so partisan and toxic,” Murphy said.
Sessions described things differently. ADVERTISEMENT
“We don’t take amendments just because you present them,” Sessions told The Hill, while noting he does not recall Murphy’s amendment. “It is a process. You need to work the dang thing, especially with Intel.”
He said lawmakers on both sides of the aisle need to fight for their amendments and testify before the Rules Committee to make their case.
“I’m not challenging Stephanie,” he said. “I found in several instances she did not come to the committee or did not work it, and you have to do both.”
Sessions defended his six-year tenure as committee chairman, saying he conducted the process in a “fair” and “straight-up way” for both Democrats and Republicans.
He also rejected Murphy’s claims that he killed her amendment for political purposes, noting that Mica is not running for the seat again.
“I don’t think that is a fair characterization for her to blame somebody for her own frailties,” Sessions said. “If she came up and worked it, that is different. But otherwise, that is a cheap shot.”
Jonathan Uriarte, Murphy’s communications director, said a bipartisan bill coordinated across parties and the intelligence committee does not require the sort of uphill battle Sessions described.
“It’s disingenuous to suggest she needed to be physically present in order for the measure to succeed, particularly given Mr. Sessions’s well-documented personal disregard for Congresswoman Murphy. In fact, her making the case in person could’ve been counter-productive to her efforts,” Uriarte said in a statement to The Hill.
The top Democrat and Republican on the Rules Committee both acknowledged that politics plays a role in the panel’s decisions, but each said they don’t know the specifics about the deepfakes amendment.
“Being chairman of the Rules Committee, I can tell you that there are a lot of forces pulling you all kinds of different ways and you don’t always get it right,” Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) told The Hill.
“But to the extent that you can be accommodating, you better err on the side of being accommodating,” he added. “I like Pete Sessions as a person, but I just thought that the way they ran this place was a disservice to this institution.”

“It's called the Speaker’s Committee for a reason,” Cole told The Hill.
He said members of the panel can make decisions for personal reasons if they do not conflict with leadership plans, noting that the success or failure of an amendment is a different calculus each time depending on a “unique set of political policy and personal considerations.”
“If there's something that's important to them personally and it's not disadvantageous to the majority then that becomes a factor,” Cole said.
When asked if Sessions was known for taking into account personal political considerations, Cole said he did so “in the appropriate way.”
“Pete Sessions was probably as loyal a team player as the Republican Party had, so he certainly would reflect those values,” Cole said.
“You don't put people in there that are vindictive by nature or that can get you in a lot of fights that don't have anything to do with the policy,” he added.
Bipartisan warnings about the disinformation threat of deepfakes are growing louder ahead of the 2020 election, with experts warning that deepfakes will be the next phase in disinformation campaigns.
And while Congress is in the early stages of pressing the intelligence community to examine the threat, there have been signs of congressional action.
A committee aide on the House Intelligence Committee told The Hill last month that the panel is planning to hold a hearing in the coming months that will examine a series of national security matters , including deepfakes."
"McSally, Biggs question DHS on release of migrants in Arizona",www.tucsonsentinel.com,Austen Bundy,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/040619_mcsally_migrants/,"Posted Apr 6, 2019, 9:16 pm Austen Bundy Cronkite News
PHOENIX – Sen. Martha McSally reiterated her support for stronger border security at a closed-door roundtable meeting this week but stopped short of supporting President Donald Trump’s threats to shut down the southern border if Mexico doesn’t stop migrants from entering the United States.
She also called on Congress to close “loopholes” that she said have created the recent influx of migrants, most of them from Central America.
The Arizona Republican organized the Monday roundtable as an “all-hands” effort with officials from the Immigration Control and Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, city leaders and heads of non-governmental organizations to discuss the apprehension and release of migrants in Arizona communities, according to an emailed press release.
“We definitely have an emergency situation and a crisis going on at our southern border,” McSally said as she addressed reporters after the event.
The senator blamed what she called an “overwhelming” influx of migrant releases into Arizona communities on loopholes within current immigration laws and agency policies.
“Congress needs to do its job … to close the legal loopholes that are creating the challenge,” McSally said.
She did not offer her view about Trump’s repeated threats to close “large sections of the border” this week but said she believed that kind of action would affect the approximately “200,000 jobs related to cross-border commerce” contributing to Arizona’s economy.
“I am not familiar with any plans within the administration,” McSally said. “We got to keep the legitimate trade and travel and cross-border commerce happening at the ports of entry.” Support TucsonSentinel.com today , because a smarter Tucson is a better Tucson.
Also weighing in on the release of apprehended migrants was Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Gilbert, who sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Monday regarding the “alarming reports” he received from immigration officials stating “that illegal aliens are being released in Arizona communities … with little more than a notice to appear for immigration hearings.”
Biggs, who was not at McSally’s roundtable, made seven inquiries into the reasoning behind the release of the migrants, adding “our inability to properly vet and monitor them puts our communities at risk.”
“Cities and communities should not be forced to bear the brunt of this crisis, which is inherently a federal responsibility,” Biggs said in his letter. “Moreover, I fear that this will only worsen the overall low-morale of ICE and Border Patrol agents who are grossly under-resourced and overworked.” - 30 -"
FactCheck: Trump's faulty wind power claims,www.tucsonsentinel.com,Jessica McDonald,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/nationworld/report/040619_trump_windmills/,"Posted Apr 6, 2019, 9:04 pm Jessica McDonald FactCheck
During an April 2 speech to the National Republican Congressional Committee, President Donald Trump once again attacked wind power, falsely claiming that noise from turbines causes cancer and that turbines sink property values by 75 percent.
The president has repeatedly erred when it comes to wind power. As we’ve explained before , when the president said living near turbines is noisy enough to make someone “go crazy after a couple of years,” there’s no direct evidence that the sound is harmful to human health.
Here, we’ll explain why there’s no turbine-cancer link, and describe some of the economic research about what happens to home prices once wind turbines are constructed. Bogus ‘Windmill’ Cancer Claim
Trump, April 2: Hillary wanted to put up wind. Wind. If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just went down 75 percent in value. And they say the noise causes cancer, you tell me that one, okay?
There is no evidence that wind turbines cause cancer. The American Cancer Society told us in a statement that it is “unaware of any credible evidence linking the noise from windmills to cancer.” We also searched the biomedical literature for any studies investigating a link, and couldn’t find any.
There is also no particular reason to think that wind turbines would cause cancer. Cancer , or what scientists think of as uncontrolled cell growth, is at heart a genetic disease because it starts when a cell has or acquires a mutation in its DNA that allows it to grow unchecked, as the National Cancer Institute explains.
Usually many of these failures are needed to form a tumor, which can then become malignant and spread throughout the body. The mutations can be inherited, come about naturally as cells replicate, or can come from environmental exposures, such as cigarette smoke, pollution or ultraviolet light. Typically, these environmental exposures are the things that people are concerned with when they talk about cancer causes. Not all of them directly impact DNA; some can lead cells to divide more quickly, increasing the odds of mutation, as the American Cancer Society says.
Sound waves, however, aren’t thought to mutate DNA or to cause cancer in any other way. In fact, some sound waves help diagnose cancer, and they might even fight off the disease , researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research outside London have found. Support TucsonSentinel.com today , because a smarter Tucson is a better Tucson.
The only plausible way wind turbines might contribute to even a small amount of cancer risk is by increasing stress or disrupting sleep . But it hasn’t yet been demonstrated that those problems do contribute to cancer risk, or that they are caused by turbine noise. Trump’s claim is baseless. Exaggerated Property Value Decline
As with his cancer claim, Trump’s idea that property values decline by 75 percent when wind turbines go up is also unsubstantiated.
Last month, at an event in Ohio, the president made a similar claim when he said , “Put the windmills up and watch the value of your house — if you’re in sight of a windmill, watch the value of your house go down by 65 percent.”
This time, the president increased the number by 10 percentage points. But no studies on the issue suggest that property values decline by that much. Many of the strongest and most relevant studies, in fact, indicate small or no changes to property values.
A July 2014 paper published in the journal Energy Economics by researchers at the University of Rhode Island, for instance, found “no statistically significant negative impacts on house prices, in either the post public announcement phase or post construction phase.” The study followed more than 48,000 transactions of single-family homes across the state, including more than 3,000 located within a mile of a turbine.
Similarly, a large study of more than 120,000 home sales in Massachusetts also found no significant drop in property values due to wind turbines. “The study found no net effects due to the arrival of turbines in the sample’s communities,” the report’s conclusion reads. “Weak evidence suggests that the announcement of the wind facilities had an adverse impact on home prices, but those effects were no longer apparent after turbine construction and eventual operation commenced. The analysis also showed no unique impact on the rate of home sales near wind turbines.” The study was commissioned by the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, and performed by researchers at the University of Connecticut and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
One 2012 Clarkson University study of about 11,000 home transactions did identify negative impacts to property values in some parts of upstate New York. Depending on the model the researchers used, their calculations showed property values could fall between 8 and 35 percent if a turbine were installed half a mile from a home. But relatively few homes were that close to turbines. And for one of the three counties studied, the group found that wind turbines generally did not decrease property values.
Research from Europe has tended to find more wind turbine impacts on property values. But those studies still aren’t reporting drops as high as 75 percent.
A recent working paper produced by the German nonprofit RWI Essen found that house values fell by an average of 7.1 percent if turbines were within 1 kilometer, or 0.6 miles, of a home. The hits were highest for older houses built before 1949, which saw up to a 23 percent decline in property value.
Other studies from Europe suggest similar or less severe drops in property values. One 2015 report from the London School of Economics, for example, found average price reductions of 5 to 6 percent when U.K. homes were within 2 kilometers, or 1.2 miles, of a wind farm. Large wind farms, however, could take off up to 12 percent of home values within the same distance.
In contrast, a 2016 Dutch study identified just a 1.4 percent drop in property values when turbines were located within 2 kilometers.
While individual owners may have unique experiences, there is nothing to corroborate Trump’s claim that wind turbines regularly result in property value drops of 75 percent. Bird Deaths & Lack of Wind
In his remarks, Trump also complained about wind turbines killing birds and falsely said that shooting a bald eagle in California can land someone in jail for five years.
Trump, April 2: And of course it’s like a graveyard for birds. If you love birds, you’d never want to walk under a windmill because it’s a very sad, sad sight. It’s like a cemetery. We put a little statue for the poor birds. It’s true. You know in California if you shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail for five years. And yet the windmills, they wipe them all out. It’s true. They wipe them out. It’s terrible.
As we’ve addressed previously , the maximum penalty for shooting a bald eagle is a fine or two years in prison, which only applies for a second or felony-level conviction. Most people do not serve jail time.
Turbines do kill birds. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service estimates that 140,438 to 327,586 birds die every year from collisions with turbines. But turbines do relatively little damage compared with other sources. More than a billion birds are lost to cats every year, and millions more to vehicles, electric lines and buildings.
Trump also repeated a fanciful story of a woman wanting to watch television, but not being able to because the wind wasn’t blowing — a tale he also relayed during his Conservative Political Action Conference speech on March 2.
But people do not lose their electricity when the wind doesn’t blow. The energy generated by wind turbines feeds into the electrical grid, which, as we’ve explained before , is almost always able to handle the intermittent nature of wind power or any other power source. - 30 -"

FactCheck: Democratic spin on Medicare,www.tucsonsentinel.com,Lori Robertson,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/nationworld/report/040619_dems_medicare_factcheck/,"Posted Apr 6, 2019, 7:03 pm Lori Robertson FactCheck.org
Democratic lawmakers claim the president’s proposed 2020 budget would “ransack” or “slash” Medicare and Medicaid, likening it to an “assault on Medicare” and “the health care of seniors and families across America.” Experts agree the proposed cuts to Medicaid are significant, but many of the Medicare proposals echo those of Barack Obama and wouldn’t directly affect beneficiaries.
President Donald Trump’s proposed 2020 budget includes a net $777 billion reduction in Medicaid spending and funding for the Affordable Care Act marketplace subsidies over 10 years, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a left-leaning think tank. Those cuts would come from repealing the ACA, including the Medicaid expansion, and turning Medicaid into a block grant program. Several Democrats have misleadingly used a higher gross figure of $1.5 trillion in cuts.
As for Medicare — a program politicians of both parties often highlight in lines of attack (see “ A Campaign Full of Mediscare ,” 2012) — those proposed spending reductions total a net $515 billion to $575 billion over 10 years, depending on how they’re measured, says the budget watchdog group the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget . That’s 5 to 5.6 percent of projected Medicare spending over the next decade. Several Democrats have used a higher figure of $845 billion, but that includes two programs that the Trump administration proposes moving to other parts of the budget.
Notably, several of the Medicare proposals in Trump’s budget are similar to cost-cutting measures Obama had espoused when he was president — some of which Republicans lambasted at the time. Readers of FactCheck.org may remember repeated claims from GOP lawmakers in years past that the Affordable Care Act would “ cut ” or “ gut ” Medicare by $500 billion or $716 billion “ at the expense of the elderly .” Now, the shoe is on the other party’s foot, with Democrats claiming these spending growth reductions would harm Medicare.
At least one of the Trump administration’s proposals — a change in out-of-pocket costs for Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage — would directly affect beneficiaries, causing some to pay le s s and others to pay more . And one lawmaker’s office argues that Trump’s proposed cuts, which include a repeal of the ACA, can’t be compared to many of Obama’s, because the cuts proposed by Obama were part of the ACA, resulting in an overall increase in health care spending and reduction in the uninsured.
It’s important to note that a president’s budget proposal is more a symbolic statement of priorities than something Congress would vote on. Indeed, Congress passed — and Trump signed — a very different bipartisan two-year spending bill a few days prior to the White House releasing its FY 2019 budget proposal.
Let’s take a look at what the president proposed. Medicare Budget Proposals
Democrats have pointed out that Trump, as a presidential candidate, said he would “save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts,” and yet his budget proposal includes spending reductions to all three. Like what you're reading? Support high-quality local journalism and help underwrite independent news without the spin .
“After exploding the deficit with his GOP tax scam for the rich, President Trump is once again trying to ransack Medicare, Medicaid and the health care of seniors and families across America,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement to the Associated Press.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said at a media availability on March 12: “The Trump budget calls for a $1.5 trillion cut in Medicaid, $850 billion cut in Medicare.” Schumer called it “hypocritical.”
“President Trump: ‘I will not cut Medicare or Social Security.’ President Trump’s budget slashes it,” Schumer said.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal called the budget an “assault on Medicare,” while Sen. Bernie Sanders asked Russell Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, in a congressional hearing, “How many thousands of people do you think will die because of massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid?”
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget called similar Medicaid cuts proposed in Trump’s 2019 budget “ substantial ,” but the group said in a March 12 post that the claim that Medicare would be cut by $845 billion, and the implication that this is a significant cut to Medicare beneficiaries, is “largely false.” The true budget reduction figure is $515 billion or $575 billion over 10 years.
The left-leaning CBPP agreed with that figure, putting the “net” amount at “nearly $600 billion.”
Two programs in Medicare — payments to hospitals for uncompensated care (called Disproportionate Share Hospital payments) and for graduate medical education — would be moved to other parts of the budget, with “most” of that spending continuing, CRFB explained.
The watchdog group estimated that 85 percent of the Medicare cuts “comes from reductions in provider payments – many of which closely resemble or build upon proposals made in President Obama’s budgets.”
Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said CRFB’s characterizations of some Trump policies mimicking those of Obama were “generally correct.”
Proposals to reduce post-acute care payments ($110 billion reduction over 10 years) and to cut payments for bad debt ($40 billion) are similar to Obama policies, CRFB said. In fact, Obama’s fiscal 2017 budget included nearly $100 billion in reduced post-acute care payments.

The Trump budget’s proposal to “equalize site-of-service payments,” meaning pay the same for outpatient services whether in a doctor’s offices or other facilities ($160 billion), and to change graduate medical education payments ($50 billion) are expansions of Obama proposals, CRFB said. Van de Water noted in a post on CBPP’s website that the site-of-service measure was similar to one from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission , an independent congressional entity that advises Congress.
“The proposals are similar to those in last year’s [fiscal 2019] budget,” Van de Water told us in an email. “Except for the proposed changes in the Medicare prescription drug benefit, and perhaps the medical liability reform, the proposals would not directly affect beneficiaries.”
Both of the budget groups were critical of Trump’s overall budget, with CRFB writing it was “ riddled with gimmicks and unrealistic assumptions” and CBPP calling it “a disturbing vision” that would “make poverty more widespread, widen inequality and racial disparities, and increase the ranks of the uninsured.” CBPP, however, didn’t mention Medicare in that assessment.
Tricia Neuman , senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation and director of its Medicare policy program, also agreed that many of Trump’s Medicare spending proposals were similar to his predecessor’s: “In a sense, yes, they are similar in that they generally aim to lower the growth in Medicare spending by reducing payments to providers, though the specific proposals differ,” she said in an email.
One proposal that would directly affect beneficiaries is a change to out-of-pocket spending in Medicare Part D ($65 billion over 10 years).
Van de Water explained in a post on the CBPP website: “ The proposed changes in the Medicare Part D drug benefit would reduce out-of-pocket costs for some beneficiaries, including those with the highest spending, while raising costs for others. The budget would limit beneficiaries’ annual out-of-pocket drug spending and eliminate cost sharing on generic drugs for recipients of Medicare’s low-income drug subsidy (LIS), which could improve LIS recipients’ access to care and promote medication adherence. At the same time, the budget would raise Part D premiums and charge more to beneficiaries whose drug spending is high but below the threshold at which catastrophic coverage kicks in.”
Neuman too, said: “When it comes to out-of-pocket spending on drug costs, the Administration’s budget is a double-edged sword; it helps some, but increases costs for others.” She said most of the proposals in the budget “would reduce the growth in spending for hospitals and other health care providers, without directly affecting beneficiaries,” though it was “very hard to predict” precisely how the proposals would affect seniors.
For comparison, Obama’s fiscal 2017 budget included $401 billion in Medicare spending reductions over 10 years, but it called for a $39 billion increase in Medicaid spending, according to CRFB’s breakdown. Industry, Democratic Response
Henry V. Connelly, deputy communications director for Speaker Pelosi, told us that Medicare advocacy groups had “concluded [Trump’s] cuts would indeed hurt Medicare beneficiaries.” He pointed to a joint statement from the Center for Medicare Advocacy and the Medicare Rights Center: “Among other things, the administration’s proposal would curtail Medicare beneficiaries’ appeal rights and increase the amount many would pay for needed prescriptions,” the groups said. “It would also jeopardize beneficiary access to critical services by significantly cutting provider payments.”
Schumer’s office told us that while Obama’s proposed budgets also called for cutting provider payments, that was in the context of the ACA and an overall expansion of health care coverage. “The Trump Administration’s proposed reductions in Medicare spending aren’t being reinvested into health care programs,” Schumer’s office said.
The ACA included a $716 billion reduction in the future growth of Medicare spending over 10 years, according to a 2012 assessment by the Congressional Budget Office, with most of that ($415 billion) in reductions in the growth of payments to hospitals. Schumer’s office said “providers supported the ACA because they were able to now treat a significant influx of newly insured patients instead of providing uncompensated care.”
There’s support for that. Chip Kahn, president and chief executive officer of the Federation of American Hospitals, criticized Trump’s budget for including “arbitrary and blunt Medicare cuts to hospitals who care for the nation’s most vulnerable,” saying it was “no time to gut Medicare.”
But in March 2010, when Congress was debating the ACA, Kahn said in a letter to then-Sen. Harry Reid that the legislation would expand coverage to millions of Americans and provide “a framework for health care delivery reform.” He wrote: “That is why hospitals will forgo $155 billion in Medicare and Medicaid payments over 10 years as part of a shared sacrifice to bring about the benefits that health reform will deliver to all Americans.”
So, the FAH supported cuts to the growth of hospital payments as a trade-off for a reduction in the uninsured.
It’s true that Trump’s proposed budget doesn’t offer that. Instead, it would reduce Medicaid spending and eliminate the ACA premium subsidies for a net $777 billion reduction over a decade. Together with proposed reductions in Medicare spending, that comes to about $1.35 trillion less in future Medicare and Medicaid spending.
But lumping them together also glosses over the fact that several of the administration’s Medicare proposals bear some resemblance to measures Democrats once supported and Republicans criticized. - 30 -"

FactCheck: Kellyanne Conway's spin on Trump's 'obstructive conduct',www.tucsonsentinel.com,Eugene Kiely,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/nationworld/report/040619_conway_trump_spint/,"Posted Apr 6, 2019, 6:59 pm Eugene Kiely Factcheck.org
White House counselor Kellyanne Conway falsely claimed that special counsel Robert Mueller’s report concluded that President Donald Trump engaged in “no — quote —‘obstructive conduct'” during the Russia investigation. Mueller’s report said it “does not exonerate” Trump of obstruction of justice.
The report, which has yet to be released, “did not draw a conclusion — one way or the other — as to whether the examined conduct [by Trump] constituted obstruction,” Attorney General William P. Barr wrote in a four-page memo summarizing the special counsel’s report. “The Special Counsel states that ‘while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,’” Barr wrote.
Instead, Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made the determination that the evidence is “not sufficient” to establish that Trump committed obstruction of justice — which is also not the same as saying there was “no – quote –‘obstructive conduct,’” as Conway said.
Conway made her remarks on PBS’“ NewsHour ” on March 25, a day after Barr released his memo on Mueller’s confidential report.
Conway, March 25: The president did not try to interfere with the investigation. And that, of course, we know, is in the documentation, that nobody at Justice felt that Mr. Mueller could not do his work. And he did his work in quiet, Judy, for 22 months, and now he has spoken.
And I think the — what we know from the Mueller report, through the Barr memo, is instructive not so much for what it says, but for what it doesn’t say, no collusion, no new indictments, no indictments of anybody named Trump, no — quote —“obstructive conduct.”
In making her case that “the president did not try to interfere with the investigation,” Conway cited “the Mueller report, through the Barr memo.” The phrase that Conway quoted —“obstructive conduct”— comes from this section of Barr’s memo:
Barr, March 24 : Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding. In cataloguing the President’s actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department’s principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of-justice offense. Thanks for reading TucsonSentinel.com. Tell your friends to follow us on Facebook and Twitter .
In other words, Barr’s memo merely said that in order to win an obstruction of justice case the government needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the presence of all three elements: obstructive conduct, corrupt intent and a pending or contemplated investigation. That’s from the U.S. Attorney’s Manual.
But, in Trump’s case, there was not sufficient evidence to satisfy all three elements. “ Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,” Barr wrote.
“He’s saying at least one of the elements is not met, but not which one,” Eric A. Posner , a law professor at the University of Chicago’s Law School, told us in an email. “I suspect it’s intent he had in mind.”
We don’t know for sure, but the president’s intent appears to be a factor in Barr’s conclusion that there was not enough evidence to pursue an obstruction of justice charge. He referenced the president’s intent in his memo.
“In making this determination, we noted that the Special Counsel recognized that ‘the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,’ and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President’s intent with respect to obstruction,” Barr wrote.
Former federal prosecutor Gene Rossi agreed that Conway’s statement is problematic.
“She is absolutely wrong to say that there was no obstructive conduct,” Rossi told us in a phone interview. “This letter doesn’t say that.”
Rossi cited a section of Barr’s memo that said there was “evidence on both sides” of the obstruction of justice case.
“After making a ‘thorough factual investigation’ into these matters, the Special Counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment,” Barr wrote. “The Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion — one way or the other — as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as ‘difficult issues’ of law and fact concerning whether the president’s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction.”
Rossi said the existence of “pro-obstruction evidence” runs counter to what Conway said. The public won’t know what conduct Mueller may have been referring to unless his report is released in some form. Support TucsonSentinel.com today , because a smarter Tucson is a better Tucson.
“What she should have said is that there was not enough evidence to warrant prosecution,” Rossi said. “But to go with this leap that he was totally exonerated, totally cleared — is absolutely absurd.” - 30 -"
Arizonans join critics of Trump call to weaken unaccompanied minors law,www.tucsonsentinel.com,Andrew Howard,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/nationworld/report/040619_border_unaccompanied/,"Posted Apr 6, 2019, 6:18 pm Andrew Howard Cronkite News
WASHINGTON – To Kit Danley, the solution to the border crisis requires more than just politics. It requires that Americans “choose love instead of fear, and long to see Jesus in the faces of the most vulnerable” who show up at the border.
Danley, president of Neighborhood Ministries in Phoenix, criticized during a conference call a Trump administration plan to weaken protections for unaccompanied migrant children who show up at the border.
Under the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act , children from Canada or Mexico can be sent back across the border once officials here determine they are not being trafficked. But children from non-bordering countries – like the Central American nations driving the current surge at the border – get to stay while border pending hearings on whether they can stay.
The president wants to change that.
President Donald Trump in January urged Congress to amend the law to allow “for the safe and humane return of illegally-smuggled minors back to their families in their home countries.” And Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan told reporters in El Paso, Texas, last week that the Central American countries the children are coming from want the same thing.
“We have government partners in the Northern Triangle – in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras – who are ready to take children back and handle that humanely. Those are their citizens, they believe they have the responsibility for,” McAleenan said. “And we’re not allowed to do that (under the trafficking victims law).”
But Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense, said the law gives minors “adequate time and support” to make a case for protection. She accused the administration of “once again targeting children” with its call to amend a law that recognizes the “unique vulnerability of children who are migrating alone.”
McAleenan told the Senate Judiciary Committee last month that disparate treatment of children from Canada and Mexico, as opposed to those from non-contiguous countries, is one of the weaknesses in our laws that “represent the most significant factors impacting border security.” Concerned about keeping quality reporting alive in Tucson?A metro area of nearly 1 million deserves a vital & sustainable source of news that's independent and locally run. Support TucsonSentinel.com with a contribution today !
Danley said that argument wilts in the face of the children the law affects.
“We must protect TVPRA, which is the only thing we have right now designed to protect these vulnerable children,” said Danley, whose organization advocates for those unaccompanied children. She talked about the impact of a recent trip she took to Central America.
“Nothing could have helped me see what the reality was until I personally went to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras,” she said. “Life is just simply not valued (there).”
Adam Estle, a Phoenix resident who works for the National Immigration Forum, has fostered a Guatemalan child who was protected by the current law.
“It was a transformational experience for my kids, my wife and me,” Estle said on Wednesday’s call. “It was a chance for us to really live out our faith in a tangible way, and I know that’s the case for many other families across the country who have opened their home to these children.”
Changing the law to send immigrants back to their country of origin will not stop them from returning, which could actually lead to a greater risk of trafficking, Estle said.
“Rather than preventing children from undertaking taking these harrowing journeys to the U.S., the proposed changes will cruelly require that they take these journeys, risking exploitation and harm, repeatedly in a desperate search for protection,” he said.
Danley called it “our shame as a follower of Jesus” that the U.S. practices “cruel immigration policies,” and called on Americans to support children who arrive alone at the border.
“Who will join us in protecting these children?” she asked. “These very children who need protecting are on our own steps, they’re in our own backyards.”

Mori Development Minister Nanaia Mahuta today welcomed the delegation from the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) to Aotearoa.
Last week Nanaia Mahuta announced that New Zealand will be taking a step forward on indigenous rights by leading a process to measure New Zealands progress towards the aspirations of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
EMRIP members have been invited to Aotearoa to provide advice on the development of that plan.
This is an exciting opportunity to hear from indigenous experts about how Aotearoa can be reflected in a Declaration plan, drawn from global models.
The EMRIP members have been invited to New Zealand by the Aotearoa Independent Monitoring Mechanism for the Declaration and the Human Rights Commission and with the agreement of the New Zealand Government.
There are a range of policies and strategies already in place that are relevant to the Declaration, but there is no overall plan. EMRIPs visit will help the Crown and Mori work together to create a plan to guide the implementation of the Declaration, said Nanaia Mahuta.
During their visit, EMRIP members will meet with various organisations, experts and the Government. They will also hold two community hui in Auckland and Wellington.
We are pleased to host these indigenous experts. Aotearoa is the third country to be visited by EMRIP, and this visit will show that we are genuinely committed to developing a national plan for the Declaration that meets New Zealands needs and aspirations.
We wish them the best for their time in Aotearoa and look forward to meeting and engaging with them, said Nanaia Mahuta.

Cold front brings rain but little temperature change,www.wsiltv.com,John Ross,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.wsiltv.com/story/40264933/cold-front-brings-rain-but-little-temperature-change,"WSIL-TV - It was a warm start to the morning with temperatures in the upper 50s and lower 60s. Showers moved through during the early hours of the morning, and most will see more rain later today.
A chance for thunderstorms continues this morning, primarily for SEMO, WKY, and the southeastern most counties in SIL. Rain chances drop off a little after noon, but will return later in the evening. I expect our best chance for rain to come along the cold front after midnight, but I've included a small chance for a few isolated thunderstorms as early as 6:00 to 7:00 pm. The biggest concern with the system along the cold front looks like localized hail and damaging winds.
Shower chances continue Monday morning, but the afternoon looks dry. Afternoon highs on Monday should rebound into the low 70s.
Meteorologist Jacie Brianne will be back later tonight with an updated look at your forecast."

Advertisement Also though every near-death experience is unique and profound, Natalie Sudman’s NDE after hitting a road-side bomb in Iraq was radically different from most. Natalie didn’t go through a tunnel, talk to God or see the beautiful vistas of heaven. And yet her experience was extraordinarily valuable for those of us who seek to understand the nature of our greater reality and the afterlife. In this post, I will outline what happened to Natalie as she describes in her book “The Application of Impossible Things: My Near-Death Experience in Iraq” and attempt to understand the implications of all the wisdom she returned with.
I was in the truck, head on hand, half asleep, and then I was not. I’ll call this instantaneous movement blinking from one place to another, for lack of a better word. In this new environment, I stood on an oval dais looking rather intrepid in my bloody and torn fatigues, slouching a bit, dirty and darkly tan, addressing thousands of white-robed beings or personalities. They were arrayed up and all around me as if I stood in the center of a huge stadium, the dais on which I stood being perhaps twenty feet in diameter. The personalities were non-physical in essence, taking on form if they intended to do that for particular purpose. I perceived the way they looked according to what I preferred for my purposes. At the time, since I had been abruptly transferred from the physical plane, it was simpler to perceive them in a human form, wearing glowing white robes.

DUBAI - Four attackers targeted a security checkpoint with guns and explosives in eastern Saudi Arabia as they tried to flee the country, leading to the death of two and the arrest of two others, Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television said on Sunday.The broadcaster, citing its correspondent, said the incident occurred at Abu Hadriyah, a highway connecting the kingdom's Eastern Province with neighboring Bahrain and Kuwait. It reported two injuries among the security forces.The oil-producing province is a flashpoint between the Sunni Muslim government and the Shi'ite minority, which complains of discrimination and repression. Starting in 2011, the region was shaken by frequent, though mostly peaceful, protests. Shi'ite militants repeatedly launched deadly attacks on Saudi security forces, but violence has been more rare since security forces largely flushed out gunmen in 2017.Al Arabiya said three of the attackers were on a list of wanted suspects from al-Qatif region, without providing more details. It said the operation took place away from built up areas.

Secretary-General's message on World Health Day [scroll down for French version],www.un.org,United Nations Office of the Spokesperson of the Secretary-General,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2019-04-07/secretary-generals-message-world-health-day-scroll-down-for-french-version," World Health Day World Health Day focuses on universal health coverage and the crucial role primary health care plays in making such coverage a reality. Half the world’s population is still unable to obtain the essential health services they need. Universal Health Coverage is about changing this and ensuring equitable access to health services for all, without people experiencing financial hardship as a result. This is central to building healthy societies and economies and to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. And it is not just about improving health services. It is about policies and action across many sectors. We need to address the broader determinants of health, including social, economic and environmental factors. And we must invest in people. We need highly trained and skilled health workers who can educate and advocate for their patients. We need empowered individuals who know how to take care of their health and that of their families. And we need communities to have access to health care when and where they need it. We must also highlight the importance of mental health, so often stigmatized and forgotten. Primary health care is the key to achieving these goals and universal health coverage. Last year’s Astana Declaration has paved the way for the world to prioritize the investments we need. Now it is time to implement the commitments made. Health is a human right. Political commitment and partnerships will be crucial in bringing it to life. Let us show the world that we are ready to bridge the gaps in health coverage worldwide and deliver health for all. Cette Journée mondiale de la santé est consacrée à la couverture sanitaire universelle et à la place centrale qu’occupent les soins de santé primaires à cet égard. La moitié des habitants de la planète ne bénéficient toujours pas des services de santé essentiels dont ils ont besoin. La couverture sanitaire universelle pourrait nous permettre d'en finir avec cette situation et de garantir que tout le monde ait accès à des services de santé sur un pied d'égalité, sans pour autant éprouver de difficultés financières. Il s'agit là d'un élément fondamental si nous voulons bâtir des sociétés et des économies saines et atteindre les objectifs de développement durable. Il n'est pas seulement question d'améliorer les services de santé, mais bien de prendre des mesures dans de nombreux autres domaines. Nous devons agir sur les facteurs plus généraux qui déterminent la santé, notamment sur les plans social, économique et environnemental. Nous devons aussi investir dans l'être humain. Il faut que le personnel sanitaire soit hautement qualifié et capable d’informer les patients et de les défendre. Il faut que chacun et chacune ait les moyens et les connaissances nécessaires pour prendre soin de sa santé et de celle de sa famille. Il faut que les populations aient accès aux soins de santé, où qu’elles soient et à chaque fois qu’elles en ont besoin. Soulignons également l’importance de la santé mentale, si souvent déconsidérée et oubliée. C’est grâce aux soins de santé primaires que nous pourrons atteindre ces objectifs et parvenir à une couverture sanitaire universelle. L’année dernière, dans la Déclaration d’Astana, le monde s’est engagé à investir en priorité dans ce domaine. Il est temps d’honorer cet engagement. La santé est un droit humain. La volonté politique et les partenariats seront indispensables pour le réaliser. Nous devons montrer au monde que nous sommes déterminés à faire ce qu’il faut pour que la couverture sanitaire devienne vraiment universelle et que toutes et tous puissent bénéficier de soins de santé."
Secretary-General's message on the 25th Anniversary of the Genocide Against the Tutsi in Rwanda [scroll down for French version],www.un.org,United Nations Office of the Spokesperson of the Secretary-General,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2019-04-07/secretary-generals-message-the-25th-anniversary-of-the-genocide-against-the-tutsi-rwanda-scroll-down-for-french-version,"New York the 25th Anniversary of the Genocide Against the Tutsi in Rwanda year marks the 25th anniversary of the genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, one of the darkest chapters in recent human history. More than 800,000 people – overwhelmingly Tutsi, but also moderate Hutu and others who opposed the genocide – were systematically killed in less than three months. On this Day, we honour those who were murdered and reflect on the suffering and resilience of those who survived. As we renew our resolve to prevent such atrocities from ever happening again, we are seeing dangerous trends of rising xenophobia, racism and intolerance in many parts of the world. Particularly troubling is the proliferation of hate speech and incitement to violence. They are an affront to our values, and threaten human rights, social stability and peace. Wherever they occur, hate speech and incitement to violence should be identified, confronted and stopped to prevent them leading, as they have in the past, to hate crimes and genocide. I call on all political, religious and civil society leaders to reject hate speech and discrimination, and to work vigorously to address and mitigate the root causes that undermine social cohesion and create conditions for hatred and intolerance. The capacity for evil resides in all our societies, but so, too, do the qualities of understanding, kindness, justice and reconciliation. Let us work together to build a harmonious future for all. This is the best way to honour those who lost their lives so tragically in Rwanda 25 years ago. Cette année marque le 25e anniversaire du génocide perpétré contre les Tutsis au Rwanda, l’un des chapitres les plus sombres de l’histoire contemporaine. Plus de 800 000 personnes – en très grande majorité des Tutsis, mais aussi des Hutus modérés et d’autres opposants au génocide – ont été exterminées de manière systématique en moins de trois mois. Aujourd’hui, nous rendons hommage à celles et ceux qui ont été assassinés et méditons sur la souffrance et la résilience des survivantes et des survivants. Alors même que nous réaffirmons notre détermination à empêcher que de telles atrocités ne se reproduisent, nous voyons la xénophobie, le racisme et l’intolérance gagner dangereusement du terrain dans de nombreuses régions du monde. La prolifération des discours de haine et des incitations à la violence est particulièrement préoccupante. De tels comportements sont un affront à nos valeurs et une menace pour les droits de la personne, la stabilité sociale et la paix. Il faut savoir reconnaître, quand ils surviennent, les discours de haine et les incitations à la violence, s’y opposer et y couper court afin qu’ils ne conduisent pas aux crimes de haine et au génocide, comme ils ont pu le faire dans le passé. Je demande instamment à tous les dirigeants politiques, chefs religieux et représentants de la société civile, hommes et femmes, de dénoncer les discours haineux et la discrimination et de s’attaquer et remédier énergiquement aux maux qui, fondamentalement, nuisent à la cohésion sociale et créent un climat propice à la haine et à l’intolérance. Si la capacité de faire le mal réside en chacune de nos sociétés, celles-ci sont aussi capables de faire preuve de compréhension et de bonté, et d’instaurer la justice et la réconciliation. Ensemble, construisons un avenir harmonieux pour toutes et tous. Je ne vois pas de meilleure façon de rendre hommage à celles et ceux qui ont perdu la vie si tragiquement au Rwanda il y a 25 ans."

A Honduran five-month-old girl is hospitalized with pneumonia in North Carolina after spending time in immigration detention cells, reported Buzzfeed News .
The girl's mother, who was only identified as A. Portillo in the report, claimed she illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border near Tijuana on Dec. 12, before being detained by the Border Patrol. ADVERTISEMENT
Portillo, 23, said she and her daughter were then placed in immigration detention cells known as hieleras or iceboxes, where she described the temperature as ""freezing.""
Immigration agents did not allow her to keep an antibiotic, amoxicillin, that her daughter had been taking, according to Portillo in the Buzzfeed report.
Agents confiscated the medicine, downplayed the girl's illness and did not provide access to a doctor, Portillo told Buzzfeed.
Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""I said I needed a hospital because her breathing was getting worse,"" Portillo told Buzzfeed. ""The agents told me I wasn't in a position to be asking for anything and that they didn't tell me to come to the United States.""
Portillo's case comes a week after the Dec. 8 death of Jackelin Caal, a Guatemalan 7-year-old girl who died in custody of CBP.
Caal's case has prompted backlash against the administration's management of unaccompanied and undocumented children, and an internal investigation at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
The Trump administration on Tuesday reversed its policy of fingerprinting all members of the household of sponsors who apply to care for unaccompanied immigrant children who are detained in the U.S., potentially allowing for the release of thousands of unaccompanied minors in the near future.
Buzzfeed reported Portillo and her daughter were transferred from the holding facility at the San Ysidro port of entry after two days, and spent a further three days in a San Diego detention center.
The two were later released, Portillo with an ankle monitor, and flew to North Carolina to reunite with family.
Portillo said her daughter had a 102.7 degree fever and was hospitalized in North Carolina, where she was diagnosed with pneumonia.
Portillo said she is seeking asylum in the U.S. after fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence."

Supreme Court Rebuffs Gun Rights Groups in Fight Against Bump Stock Ban - Tennessee Star,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/supreme-court-rebuffs-gun-rights-groups-in-fight-against-bump-stock-ban/ ,"by Kevin Daley
The Supreme Court rejected another last-ditch bid to stop the Trump administration’s bump stock ban, denying a gun rights coalition a temporary exemption from the new regulation early Friday afternoon.
Friday’s order was the third application relating to the bump stock ban that the Supreme Court has rejected in recent weeks.
The plaintiffs in Friday’s case were five individuals and three gun rights organizations, including the Firearms Policy Foundation, the Madison Society Foundation, and Florida Carry. They sought a temporary reprieve from the ban for themselves and their members.
“Absent a stay, applicants and their members will be required to surrender or destroy their property or face felony charges for possession of devices that were unquestionably legal under ATF’s construction of the statute for the past 85 years and ATF’s prior written rulings stating as much,” their petition reads.
Neither the vote count nor the Court’s reasoning was disclosed, as is typical of orders of this nature, though Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch noted their dissent.
Bump stocks are an accessory that increases a semiautomatic rifle’s rate of fire. The Department of Justice says the appendage effectively turns a semiautomatic weapon into a machine gun, which the government can aggressively regulate under the Firearms Act of 1986.
The Supreme Court has separately dismissed two other bids to delay implementation of the new bump stock rule: Chief Justice John Roberts rejected one such application in late March, and the full Court turned away a second one on March 28.
The administration promulgated a new rule banning the possession and distribution of bump stocks after the Harvest music festival massacre in Las Vegas, Nevada. Gunman Stephen Paddock outfitted more than a dozen AR-15 rifles with bump stocks to perpetrate the massacre. 58 people died, and hundreds were injured.
The ban took effect on March 26. There are 500,000 bump stocks in circulation, according to Gun Owners of America. The new rule requires any person or entity in possession of bump stocks to destroy or surrender them to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).
There is one man in America who can legally own bump stocks as of this writing. Utah Shooting Sports Council chairman Clark Aposhian obtained a temporary stay of the ban from the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on March 21. The stay applies to him only.

ReNew Fleece Sweatshirt , $55 from Everlane: Every time I wear this sweater, someone pets my arm (which could be a bad thing, but it’s usually people I know). It’s soft and comfortable and looks better than your average, everyday sweatshirt. - Jillian Lucas
Everyone for Every Body Citrus Mint 3-in-1 Soap , $18.98 on Amazon: I’m huge on how soaps smell and how it ends up lingering on your skin. The bright citrus and the earthy, minty-ness from two different types of mint give this body wash/shampoo/bubble bath combo so much more interesting than your average soap. - Jillian Lucas
LITE High-Rise Leggings , $78 from Girlfriend Collective: The Compressive leggings from Girlfriend Collective are great, but the smooth, lightweight LITE leggings, made from recycled fishing nets from the ocean are golden. - Jillian Lucas
Women’s Wool Loungers , $95 from All Birds: The All Birds Lounger, made from sustainably sourced Merino wool, is a shoe that I wear in so many different situations. It’s my universal footwear for running errands around the neighborhood or even getting brunch on a particularly hard-to-wake-up weekend morning. - Jillian Lucas
Women’s Fitted Crew , $28 from KNOWN SUPPLY: One of my favorite t-shirts is a white crewneck from KNOWN SUPPLY that has my name embroidered on it. It’s incredibly soft, fits me perfectly, and comes from a brand that is transparent about who is making your clothes —they put on tags with the makers’ name written in. - Jillian Lucas

Adam Schiff Kicks Sand In The Eye Of Bully Trump By Vowing To Expose This White House,www.politicususa.com,Jason Easley,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.politicususa.com/2019/04/07/adam-schiff-kicks-sand-in-the-eye-of-bully-trump-by-vowing-to-expose-this-white-house.html,"Adam Schiff Kicks Sand In The Eye Of Bully Trump By Vowing To Expose This White House 3.2k Subscribe Print Flipboard
House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) stood up to Trump’s bullying, refused to apologize, and vowed to investigate the president.
Schiff said on CNN’s State of The Union, “I don’t regret calling out this president for what I consider deeply unethical and improper conduct, not a bit, and I think that the moment that we start to think that we should back away from exposing this kind of malfeasance and corruption is a dangerous point. Now, Jake, you’ve asked the question many times is there a risk of doing too much oversight? There is a risk when you have an immoral president. A president lacking in basic character, who violates the norms of office, there is a risk of doing too little oversight, so I make no apologies for that, and I’m going to continue holding this administration accountable.”

— PoliticusUSA (@politicususa) April 7, 2019 Adam Schiff Is Going To Investigate Trump
The president and his White House were desperate to get rid of Rep. Schiff as Intelligence Committee Chairman and it is clear why. Adam Schiff isn’t distracted by Trump’s games and insults. He doesn’t care about the tweets or the statements the president makes at his rallies. Rep. Schiff has a job to do, and that is to conduct oversight into the most ethically devoid administration since Nixon.
Corruption is a feature, not a bug of the Trump administration.
Rep. Schiff is correct. After two years of Republicans in Congress doing zero oversight, Democrats in the House have to work twice as hard to do what already should have been done, while trying to keep up with corrupt behavior as it unfolds.
Adam Schiff can’t be bullied. He appears to be a person of iron will and laser sharp focus, and he is locked in on Donald Trump."
