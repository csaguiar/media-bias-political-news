The two minute video has very suspenseful music playing in the background and starts out by showing quick shots of Obama, Hillary and the different symbolic landmarks in Washington DC.
At about the :20 second mark the words ‚ÄúFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they call you racist‚Äù flashed across the screen.
After more anti-Trump icons flashed on the screen, President Trump was shown getting to work, boarding Air Force One, meeting foreign leaders and attending rallies.
The video then pivoted to highlighting some of the attacks on the President and the Trump administration including the Mueller investigation and the bogus Brett Kavanaugh allegations.
NATIONWIDE POLL: Was Obama The Worst President In History?
At about the 1:20 mark of the video, it pivots once again to show some very disappointed celebrities including Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell and Amy Schumer. Two women who have made it obvious that they hate President Trump.
As the video continued, it showed President Trump getting involved with the American people including his trip to Alabama after the devastating tornadoes. This portion of the video made you really understand how much President Trump loves and cares for the American people.
‚ÄúYour vote, proved them all wrong‚Äù flashed across the screen. In 2016, the American people came together and rejected everything former President Barack Obama did by electing Donald J. Trump to Make America Great Again.
The video then went on to highlight some of President Trump‚Äôs greatest accomplishments including peace talks with Kim Jong Un and the booming economy. These are just two of the many different things that the President has been able to accomplish during his past two years in office.
The video ended with Trump waving his fist in a triumphant motion with the words ‚ÄúTRUMP: THE GREAT VICTORY 2020‚Äù flashing across the screen.
The 2020 election is closer than you may think and as Trump supporters, it‚Äôs important that we rally behind the President to help him get re-elected.
URGENT 2020 POLL: Trump or Bernie?
Check out what Fox News reported in relation to President Trump and the Democratic frontrunners. Democratic primary voters were read a list of 20 announced and potential candidates for the 2020 nomination. Biden is the top choice at 31 percent, followed by Sanders at 23 percent.
California Sen. Kamala Harris (8 percent) and former Texas Rep. Beto O‚ÄôRourke (8 percent) make up a second tier. They are followed by New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (4 percent), Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (4 percent), and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (2 percent).
The other candidates are the political equivalent of a 16th seed ‚Äî they receive less than two percent.
Eleven percent are unsure of their picks.
Men, women, whites, non-whites, college graduates, and non-graduate Democratic primary voters all put Biden first and Sanders second. Sanders has the edge among those under age 45, while Biden is first for those 45 and over.
Democratic primary voters are more likely to support a candidate they think can beat Trump (51 percent) than the candidate they like the most (36 percent).
According to this same poll, both Biden and Sanders would beat President Trump in the general election. The President need YOU more than ever!

"President Trump SLAMS Russia Hoax, Defends Himself from Obstruction in Tweet",ilovemyfreedom.org,Collin Rugg,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://ilovemyfreedom.org/president-trump-slams-russia-hoax-defends-himself-from-obstruction-in-tweet/,"April 6, 2019 Collin Rugg
In a tweet on Saturday, President Trump slammed the Russia hoax and also defended himself from obstruction of justice which has been a growing talking point for the far Left media.
Since the release of Attorney General William Barr‚Äôs summary of the Mueller report, the Left has continued their Russia conspiracy theories along with other claims that the President obstructed justice. The Mueller report specifically stated that the Trump Campaign did NOT collude with Russia and never specified if there was obstruction.
SPECIAL OFFER: Free Trump 2020 Hat While Supplies Last
‚ÄúSo, let‚Äôs get this straight!‚Äù the President said in a tweet. ‚ÄúThere was No Collusion and in fact the Phony Dossier was a Con Job that was paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. So the 13 Angry Democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up Fraud. I just fought back against something I knew never existed, Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous!) ‚Äì No Obstruction. This Russia Hoax must never happen to another President, and Law Enforcement must find out, HOW DID IT START?‚Äù So, let‚Äôs get this straight! There was No Collusion and in fact the Phony Dossier was a Con Job that was paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. So the 13 Angry Democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up Fraud. I just fought back‚Ä¶.

‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 6, 2019
The President has a right to be angry. The entire Russia Investigation was started based off of a fake and phony dossier made by Christopher Steele who was paid off by the DNC and Hillary Clinton. The fact that the Left is trying to say that President Trump obstructed justice with an investigation that was proven to be a total hoax, is appalling.
Now that the Mueller investigation is over, Democrat Adam Schiff has announced that he is starting his own investigations into President Trump even though the Mueller report showed no evidence of wrongdoing. Schiff is just one of the many Democrats who continues to push the Russia collusion conspiracy theory and he is also echoing the obstruction of justice talking point.
VOTE NOW: Do You Agree With Trump‚Äôs STRONG Support For The 2nd Amendment?
During an interview with Sean Hannity last week, President Trump slammed Schiff and called on him to resign.
‚ÄúI heard they should force him off the committee, or off the committee chair ‚Äî he should be forced out of office,‚Äù The President said.
‚ÄúHe is a disgrace to our country,‚Äù Trump added.
‚ÄúAnd you have plenty of others,‚Äù Trump said, noting that there are others who think Schiff should resign.
Trump wasn‚Äôt done. Just last week, President Trump slammed Schiff. ‚ÄúWell, Schiff is a bad guy because he knew he was lying. He‚Äôs not a dummy. For a year and a half, he would go on and just lie and lie and leak and call up CNN and others.‚Äù
In a tweet he also stated, ‚ÄúCongressman Adam Schiff, who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking, should be forced to resign from Congress!‚Äù
It‚Äôs time for America to move on from the Russia investigation. For the past two years, this bogus investigation has divided our country and now that it is officially over, it‚Äôs time to MOVE ON!

The Marxists at home under Attlee,yes Attlee was not the ""great"" statesman they have recently tried to paint him as, he was a committed far left Socialist and kept Britain skint after the war,and the Americans destroyed the Empire prematurely,the Americans humiliating Britain in the Suez affair.After the war the Socialists rode on a wave of pro Soviet propaganda ,necessary during the war, and kept it going to base the new plan for Britain on Communist Russia. They Socialised Britain and when the people kicked out Attlee,the Tories did not have the guts to reverse it. This paved the way for the destructive and nihilistic 1960s; Its been down hill ever since."

Britain could and would trade perfectly happily with Europe as it does with everyone else and it would be easier to trade with countries such as New Zealand,Australia, Canada,the US .
