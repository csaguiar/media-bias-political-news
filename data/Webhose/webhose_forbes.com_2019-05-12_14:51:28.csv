Ikea Creates A Satellite Showroom to Navigate a Niche Market,www.forbes.com,Sanford Stein,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sanfordstein/2019/04/12/ikea-creates-a-satellite-showroom-to-navigate-a-niche-market/,"Ikea will join the ranks of retailers opening smaller stores with the launch of their “city center” location Monday April 15, located on New York’s Upper East Side. Ikea’s compact prototype distinguishes itself from other retailers, such as Target, who have downsized to take advantage of dense urban areas. Ikea is taking a unique, non-stocking showroom approach. The Ikea concept is very much a planning studio, a place for customers to get ideas, book planning sessions , and make online purchases. This may be done with or without the very able-bodied and highly trained sales assistants that Ikea is known for. The three level, 17,000 square foot store is strategically laid out in a manner that addresses three complementary planning stages: design ideas, componentry, and the planning/implementation process. At focus are the compact New York City living spaces that are becoming common to other dense urban areas throughout the country. A series of prototypical apartments, of varying (small) sizes are completely fitted out, furnished and accessorized. It’s walkthrough catalog, meets staged “open house”. The concept takes Ikea’s customary warehouse store vignettes to the next level with arrangements of cabinets, storage units and accessories, in very real localized configurations.
In addition to the finished-out suites, are more segmented “storage stories” that suggest the near endless combinations of organizational parts and pieces to choose from. Dovetailing with the myriad of storage systems, are the finish choices for cabinets, countertops and the like. Last, but not least, is the third-floor planning area with the appropriate computers and associated work areas, to engage in the planning process. Naturally, there are multiple flat-screen terminals placed throughout, that provide access to IKEA-USA.com.
The entire experience is representative of the next retail iteration that holistically blends online and offline. It moves the emphasis away from product-based selling to solution-based selling, while maintaining an emphasis on “clienteling.” Best of all it adds phenomenal sales potential, while piggybacking on larger neighboring full-service stores, to handle logistics and distribution. It does not surprise me one bit, that Ikea would take the lead in producing a hybrid retail format that would so specifically and successfully address a niche segment within its own brand universe. I’m also betting that throughout the planning process little if any discussion time was spent on “sales attribution.” I look forward to visiting one of the 30 such “non-storing stores” being rolled out in the coming years."
New Bill Could Fix Public Service Loan Forgiveness,www.forbes.com,Adam Minsky,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2019/04/12/new-bill-could-fix-public-service-loan-forgiveness/,"As many student loan borrowers already know, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program is a bit of a mess. While the program is legitimate and has some success stories , PSLF has a complicated set of requirements that limit the program's benefits to Direct federal loans that are repaid under specific types of repayment plans -- income-driven plans only. Even the employment component of the program, which requires that borrowers work full-time for either a government entity or nonprofit organization, isn't always straightforward . As a result, many student loan borrowers think they are making progress towards loan forgiveness, when in fact they are not.
To make matters even more complicated, the U.S. Department of Education and its contracted loan servicers do a terrible job managing the program . Servicers have misled borrowers and failed to notify them of the program requirements. At the same time, the Department of Education has rolled back oversight and other consumer protections .
This has caused many student loan borrowers to fall through bureaucratic cracks in a seemingly never-ending quest to correct errors or get accurate information. Meanwhile, some politicians in Washington -- including President Trump -- have been calling for a full repeal of PSLF .
A new bill about to be introduced into Congress by Democratic senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Tim Kaine could be a game-changer. The bill would not only preserve PSLF, it would completely overhaul the program to make it more efficient, more fair, and more accessible to student loan borrowers. Here are some of the major highlights:
The bill would allow payments made under any repayment plan -- not just income-driven plans -- to qualify for PSLF. The bill does not allow for non-Direct federal loans (like FFEL-program loans) to qualify for PSLF, so borrowers would still have to consolidate their loans via the Direct loan program to access PSLF. However, the bill would allow borrowers to have payments made on their FFEL loans prior to consolidating count towards PSLF. That's simply not possible under current law. Right now, PSLF is an all-or-nothing program. Borrowers either will make 120 qualifying payments (which takes a minimum of 10 years) and get their entire loan balance forgiven, or they will get no forgiveness at all if they don't meet the program's requirements. However, the new bill would allow borrowers to get 50% of their loan balance forgiven after five years of public service work, and then the rest forgiven after the second five year period. This is huge. The bill would streamline and automate the PSLF application process by creating a fully electronic application. The Department of Education would also be required to provide more detailed information up-front to borrowers about the PSLF program, its requirements, and the associated procedures (including ways to dispute PSLF-related determinations). This bill really could be the PSLF ""fix"" that student loan borrowers need, and it could dramatically improve the program. Millions of people could benefit from this. Do your elected officials support these reforms? Make sure they hear from you -- here's what you can do ."
'Star Wars: Episode IX' Trailer Feels Like An Apology For 'The Last Jedi',www.forbes.com,Dani Di Placido,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2019/04/12/star-wars-episode-ix-trailer-feels-like-an-apology-for-the-last-jedi/,"The teaser trailer for Episode IX: The Rise Of Skywalker feels strangely apologetic - even the film’s title appears to be an apology, a confirmation that Luke’s legacy didn’t really evaporate in the sun like a mud puddle. “We’re sorry Luke drank alien breast milk,” the trailer seems to be saying. “Hope you like Force ghosts, because we’ve got a lot of damage control to do. Hey, remember Palpatine?”
The titular Skywalker is a mystery, seeing as the Skywalker blood runs through several characters; is it Leia, Luke, Kylo, perhaps even Rey? It wouldn’t surprise me if Rey’s humble origins undergo a dramatic revision.
It’s hard not to watch this trailer and feel cynical, especially after seeing Kylo’s Darth Vader cosplay helmet soldered back together again. The shattering of said helmet marked a major moment of character development for Kylo, the moment when the angry young boy realized he had to become his own man, to stop living in the shadow of his grandfather.
In short, it was one of the things that Rian Johnson got right. As underwhelming as The Last Jedi was, half of it was a good movie, and I hope that J.J. Abrams isn’t too keen to undo the plot points of that film in order to appease the angry fans.
It’s strange to hear Mark Hamill’s voice narrate this trailer; it’s a strong hint that Luke is returning, (in some form or another) right after his story concluded, admittedly with a damp fizzle rather than a bang, but still, an ending.
The trailer proudly boasts Lando Calrissian, the last original trilogy character, and a glimpse of what appears to be the ruins of the Death Star - let’s hope the First Order refrains from building yet another version.
The trailer ends with the unmistakable cackle of Emperor Palpatine. Really? I know Snoke was nothing more than an echo of Palpatine, but that doesn’t mean the franchise has to return to the original big bad. Again, this is a character whose story ended long ago. Has he been resurrected, repeating the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
Rian Johnson pushed the story in a dramatically different direction from J.J. Abrams, who appears to be pulling it back, which is rather alarming. Might have been an idea to structure the new trilogy before filming, lest the tone wobbles and plot holes open.
But J.J. Abrams, nostalgia-obsessive as he may be, understood the appeal of the new characters, and built up great chemistry between the cast. The most promising aspect of The Rise Of Skywalker (I simply can’t take that name seriously), is the prospect of seeing these characters together again, watching their relationships evolve, instead of wasting time in casinos and making convoluted plans that never go anywhere.
And if we see a satisfying conclusion to Kylo Ren’s story, I’ll be very happy indeed; the melodramatic Vader fanboy might just be the most interesting person in the galaxy."
What Will 2019 Look Like For EOG Resources?,www.forbes.com,Trefis Team,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/04/12/what-will-2019-look-like-for-eog-resources/,"
In this Thursday, Dec. 15, 2011 photo, frac sand destined for the oil and gas fields piles up at the EOG Resources Inc. processing plant in Chippewa Falls, Wisc. (AP Photo/Steve Karnowski)
Houston-based E&P company EOG Resources’ (NYSE:EOG) fortunes are looking increasingly favorable as we head further into 2019. The oil driller significantly reduced its cost of drilling after oil prices fell from their 2014 highs. Recent data points to EOG’s finding and development costs coming in at $8.90 currently, down from $12.45 in 2016. Additionally, depreciation costs are down 40% over the last four years.
Furthermore, the company has projected that it has 13 years of premium inventory at the current drilling rate. Currently EOG Resources produces 970 MBoE of premium inventory. Premium inventory is defined as inventory where the company achieves break-even above a price of $45 per barrel.
We currently have a price estimate of $116 per share for EOG Resources , which is higher than its market price. View our interactive dashboard – EOG in 2019 – and modify the key on its valuation.
Trefis With EOG Resources able to achieve positive cash flow with the price of oil being above $55 a barrel, and with the company’s debt not too high (the current ratio of the company is at 1.25) we believe that EOG could use the excess cash to improve its portfolio, pay a dividend, or buy back stock. All of which would be positive for its stockholders.
Key facts:
The Eagle Ford well costs are expected to fall this year from $4.5 million to $4.3 million, similarly at its other big operation, the Wolfcamp basin, costs are expected to fall from $7.5 million to $7.3 million. We expect the average realized price for oil in 2019 to be around $61 a barrel, in 2018 the company achieved an average realized price of $59 per barrel. The company was producing 765,000 BP/d of oil at the end of 2018, and we expect that the company will expand its production by anywhere from 10-15% for the year. The company currently produces 23,000 McF/d of natural gas. We believe it can add an additional 5% to capacity in 2019. The company achieved a return-on-capital-employed of 15% in 2018, which was best among its peers. We expect that ROCE could come in at 16-17% in 2018. Overall, the company is well placed to see an upside to its revenue, margins, and therefore stock in 2019, as it improves its production efficiency, and increases output.

Rally The Realm And Immerse Yourself In Game of Thrones At These 2019 Hot Spots,www.forbes.com,Jeanne O'Brien Coffey,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanneobriencoffey/2019/04/12/rally-the-realm-and-immerse-yourself-in-game-of-thrones-at-these-2019-hot-spots/,"The frenzy around the last season of HBO’s Game of Thrones has reached a fever pitch – even NPR is dropping references. But don’t despair – the Iron Throne can be yours, if you’re willing to travel to Belfast. Or you can hole up in Lannister’s Lair for an epic binge-watch, glamp at Winterfell Castle, and visit the original King’s Landing (hint: it’s Malta). Here are a couple of ways to soothe yourself as the shocks of Westeros wind up to a final, likely very bloody, ending.
Valletta in Malta served as the original King's Landing.
Malta Film Commission Roll back the clock to Season One in Malta : Ah, those halcyon days with so many seasons ahead. The quest for power between the Houses of Stark, Baratheon, Lannister and Targaryen all started on the island of Malta . So these days, the island nation offers tours with local actors who took part in Season One, telling the stories behind the gardens of Kings Landing, the Red Waste, the Tower of the Hand, the Stables, Maegor's Holdfast, the Red Keep, Cobblers Square, The Street of Steel, Baelish Brothels (ext), Coppersmith's Wynd, King's Gate, King's Square, and the village of Lhazar (when accessible). The Maltese Islands are no strangers to celebrity -- the beautiful coastlines and ancient architecture have doubled for an amazing variety of locations from ancient Rome to 19th-century Marseille and 1960's Beirut. In fact, the country has been dubbed ""the Mediterranean's mini-Hollywood"" by the London Times.
Visit the Iron Throne room in Belfast : This summer, through September 1st, 2019, GAME OF THRONES®: The Touring Exhibition, is on display at TEC Belfast —its debut visit to the UK and Ireland. Among other ephemera, fans can have an up-close look at the ancient dragon skulls, ranging in size from about that of an apple to the one belonging to Balerion the Dread, which decorated the throne room in the Red Keep until King Robert Baratheon had them hidden away in the catacombs. The exhibit offers two-never-seen before sets, including the vast crypt of Winterfell, guarded by stone direwolves, where visitors can pay their respects to six of the Stark ancestors.
Host the most epic binge party ever at Refinery Hotel.
Allan-Warren Plan an epic binge in Lannister’s Lair : Prefer to be a couch potato? NYC’s Refinery Hotel has created “ Lannister’s Lair ,” a suite that will be available every Sunday from April 14th through the end of the season. Starting at $569 per night, guests can spend the day under fur throws, re-watching past seasons on HBO Go before the new Sunday night episode. Toast to the monumental season with goblets full of wine and order dishes such as Braavos Branzino and Dragon Snack from a specially themed room service menu.
Bend the knee around Europe: The folks at travel deals web site TravelPirates have pulled together a bevy of experiences, including a list of 21 GoT filming locations you can visit, from Kingsroad in Ballymoney, Northern Ireland, to Dorne, found in Alcazar of Seville, Spain. TravelPirates also offers a glamping package at Winterfell . Or at least Castle Ward, which served as the real-life filming location for the Starks' ancestral fortress, for about $326 for two. The package includes a night in a glamping pod in the forest surrounding Winterfell, an archery lesson in the same spot where they filmed the archery scene in the show's first-ever episode, and a bicycle tour to filming locations in the area. And to help you really fit in, you'll get to borrow costumes and swords.
Visit the studio where it all happened : If you can wait until next year, Linen Mill Studios in Banbridge, Northern Ireland—the original filming location used for many iconic scenes throughout the run of the series—will be open to the public for what a press release promises will be a “deeply immersive and sensory experience” evoking “the show’s magnificence from King’s Landing, Winterfell, Dragonstone, The Wall and the lands beyond, to kingdoms across the Narrow Sea like Mereen and Braavos.” Which is a pretty tall order. The Game of Thrones Studio Tour will original sets, costumes and props from all seasons in an 110,000-square-foot interactive experience opening in Spring 2020. The tour promises to let fans wander in the footsteps of Westeros’s most prominent residents, re-living key moments from the series and standing right where they took place."
How To Exempt Your Retirement Account From Taxes,www.forbes.com,Ken Kam,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkam/2019/04/12/how-to-exempt-your-retirement-account-from-taxes/,"With the growing number of proposals to increase taxes, its time to rethink how we save for retirement. Proposals to increase the top income tax rate , impose a new annual estate/wealth tax , and to tax unrealized capital gains , are not likely to pass this year. However, the odds are rising that by the time you retire, taxes will be higher making a Roth IRA, where withdrawals are usually tax-free, significantly better for most people than a Traditional IRA. Here's what you need to know. The main differences
With a Traditional IRA, you don't pay tax on the money you deposit, but the money you take out is taxed as ordinary income.
With a Roth, you deposit money on which you've already paid taxes, but the money you take out is not taxable.
Which one is better for you?
Let's suppose that you are in the 30% tax bracket for 2018 and this weekend you have to decide whether to put $5,500 into a Roth or a Traditional IRA.
Click here to use Fidelity's online calculator to find your actual maximum contribution.
If you put the $5,500 in a Traditional IRA, you will get an immediate benefit of $1,650 because you won't have to pay taxes of 30% on the $5,500. Sounds good, but fast forward 20 years to when you start taking money out of the IRA. Your account will have grown tax-free for 20 years. At 10% a year, your account would be worth $33,637.
The catch is that the money you withdraw from a traditional IRA is taxed as ordinary income. If your income tax rate at that time is higher than it is now, you will pay that higher rate not just on the original $5,500 but also on all of the growth, even the portion due to capital gains which are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. If your tax rate at withdrawal time is 40%, you'll pay $13,455 in taxes as you withdraw the money so you'll have $20,182 to spend.
If you put the $5,500 in a Roth IRA, your tax bill will be $1,650 higher this year. But 20 years from now, you'll be able to start withdrawing $33,637 without any additional taxes. Think of the $1,650 of extra taxes you pay this year as prepaying the taxes on a $5,500 investment.
Normally it's not a good idea to pre-pay taxes. But in this case, the numbers argue otherwise. Instead of paying taxes of $13,455 as you withdraw the money from a traditional IRA, with a Roth you pay $1,650 now and then get 20 years of growth on $5,500 tax-free.
In other words, your $1,650 payment reduces your future taxes by $13,455. That in itself is a tax-free return of a little more than 11% a year on your $1,650 -- a sweet deal!
If your taxes are lower in the future, or you have less than 20 years until retirement, the numbers will still favor the Roth, though by a smaller margin.
The return on your $5,500 investment over the 20 years is probably the biggest factor on the decision to fund a Roth or Traditional IRA. I assumed a 10% annual return in my example which approximates the long-run return of the S&P 500. If you invest 40% in bonds, your long-run return will likely be lower, but the Roth will still come out better.
As you work on your taxes this weekend, consider fully funding a Roth IRA.
Although there is a whiff of socialism in the air these days, the proposals to raise taxes are not likely to pass this year or next. But in the next 20 years, there will be 10 more elections.
In most scenarios, the Roth will work out to be better for your retirement even if tax rates don't change. However, the more tax rates rise, the better the Roth looks.

NVIDIA Is Coming For Your Data Center,www.forbes.com,Moor Insights and Strategy,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2019/04/12/nvidia-is-coming-for-your-data-center/,"NVIDIA Article by Steve McDowell.
NVIDIA’s GPU Technology Conference (GTC) took place a few weeks ago near the company’s headquarters in San Jose, California. Be careful how you say “GPU,” though—NVIDIA’s founder and CEO Jensen Huang was clear that it’s a term he avoids, preferring to use product names. NVIDIA’s processing technology, you see, is about much more than just graphics.
“NVIDIA is a data center company,” the usually hyperkinetic Jensen Huang said, very matter-of-factly to a room full of industry analysts. He went on to say that NVIDIA is “focusing on the big problems of data center scale computing,” and “delivering an accelerated computing platform.”
Jensen’s vision aligns with where the world is going. Enterprise workloads are increasingly being enabled by AI technologies, and corporate data is being mined for insights by data center machine learning stacks. Edge compute and the rise of 5G is going to accelerate the need to deliver real-time analytics and insights, enabled by exactly the kinds of technologies that NVIDIA delivers.
Artificial intelligence, whether it is client-side inference, or driven by deep machine learning technologies, is the future of compute. It’s a future that runs on specialized hardware enabled by a consistent software stack.
Heading into the datacenter
NVIDIA built a machine learning supercomputer that it calls DGX. Jensen told the industry analysts at GTC that he really didn’t want to build the DGX, explaining that it was a big expensive project that the tier one OEMs would have been better at. The problem was he couldn’t find an OEM who shared his vision—so he built it himself. Then the OEMs came calling.
Machine learning in the data center requires a different way of thinking about data and storage. Machine learning pipelines are hungry beasts that need to be fed. NVIDIA recognized this and partnered with innovative partners in the storage space to bring a hyper-converged machine learning solution to market, ready-made for the various OEMs’ channel partners.
Pure Storage last year introduced its AIRI platform, coupling its high-performance FlashArray with the DGX. IBM recently released its Spectrum Storage for AI, marrying IBM storage with NVIDIA’s DGX series. Even Dell EMC partnered with the company, and very recently announced a coupling of NVIDIA’s DGX with the Dell EMC Isilon. There are no shortage of solutions.
NVIDIA’s DGX is a stellar offering, but it’s a very specialized piece of gear. In order to truly penetrate the data center, it’s critical that the server OEM world is engaged and building products around the solution. To that end, at GTC, NVIDIA introduced a number of server designs, all of which are being built by the server OEM community. Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise , Inspur, Fujitsu, Sugon, and Lenovo are all building workstations and servers based around NVIDIA specifications and validation suites.
This is a critical step forward, not just for NVIDIA and the server supplier world, but for enterprise IT. The strength of these relationships allows enterprise buyers to trust the solutions that they are deploying for AI and ML workloads.
It's all about that software
NVIDIA’s machine learning success comes from the intelligent choices the company makes in enabling the software ecosystem. I don’t know whether AI and machine learning were always a part of NVIDIA’s vision when it delivered CUDA to the world over a decade ago, or if it were a happy accident. It’s likely that the company’s GPUs were simply well-suited to solve machine learning problems, and CUDA gave the computer scientists the right sets of tools to exploit the raw capabilities.
It’s hard to remember that far back, but NVIDIA’s only real competition when it delivered CUDA was ATI, who had just been acquired by AMD . AMD seriously thought about joining NVIDIA in enabling a CUDA ecosystem (I know this because I was on the AMD corporate strategy team at the time), but instead made the fateful decision to place its bets on OpenCL.
The machine learning world rallied around the CUDA ecosystem, allowing NVIDIA to dominate that space today. Not resting on that dominance, NVIDIA significantly stepped up its development tools offerings at GTC. NVIDIA released CUDA-X, which packages a number of enterprise-ready libraries with the CUDA ecosystem, for easy deployment in most of the popular machine learning frameworks.
Container vision
NVIDIA also enhanced RAPIDS. RAPIDS is a suite of open source software libraries for data science and analytics pipelines that are accelerated by CUDA. RAPIDS is well-named, as it quickly enables enterprise level analytics.
Beyond CUDA and RAPIDS, NVIDIA is driving a vision of container-based workflows—where each step of an AI workflow is in a container that’s positioned where it needs to be in the data center. It’s not an accident that NVIDIA scooped Mellanox up from a pending Intel Corporation acquisition. NVIDIA sees flexible workload deployment as the optimal architecture for complex real-time AI and ML/DL workflows, a vision that relies on fast and reliable interconnects.
Beyond tools: jumpstarting solutions
It’s a simple matter to deliver tools to the industry and hope that the tools are used to build something great. It’s an order-of-magnitude greater to deliver entire pieces of a long-term vision in order to jump-start the future. NVIDIA has long been associated with autonomous cars. Its DRIVE program is a targeted set of technologies to help autonomous vehicle companies jumpstart their development. GTC saw the introduction of a slew of new capabilities for DRIVE, including a hardware platform, new software tools, and DRIVE Constellation which provides autonomous vehicle simulation. The icing on the cake for NVIDIA’s DRIVE announcements was news of its collaboration with Toyota. Toyota will be leveraging NVIDIA’s DRIVE tools as it moves its autonomous vehicle program forward.
Autonomous cars are interesting, but more world-changing is the potential of deep learning in the medical industry. NVIDIA Clara is a set of targeted software tools, including training sets, that enable developers to build medical imaging workflows using NVIDIA CUDA-enabled processors to deliver AI-enabled medical diagnostics.
These are just a few examples of how NVIDIA is going deep with software to enable machine learning. There were also announcements and activities around robotics, embedded ML, real-time ray tracing, accelerated computing, design and visualization, and more.
Concluding thoughts
NVIDIA’s greatest contribution to machine learning and AI is not its GPUs, or even its software tools. NVIDIA has positioned itself as a lighthouse, illuminating its vision for how ML-driven AI can revolutionize every industry. Yes, build your solution with us, NVIDIA says, but let us show you the power of where it will all lead.
NVIDIA preaches a vision where AI and ML look at our world, interpret it, and help us make better sense of it all. This is true across the spectrum, from technologically interesting applications such as robotics and autonomous vehicles, to business-enhancing services such as autonomous customer relations. This all leads to humanity-impacting intelligent systems such as those that can look at your medical image and help you live a longer and healthier life.
NVIDIA is both ambitious and successful. I like where the company going, and how it’s taking us there. NVIDIA could easily relax and enjoy its near monopoly in machine learning, but instead Jensen has decided to push hard for an ambitious future. We’re all just getting started in this space, and I’m happy with what NVIDIA is doing to move us forward.

Defeat Can Be A Growth Pain Or A Pain In The Butt: You Choose,www.forbes.com,Bryan Robinson,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2019/04/12/defeat-can-be-a-growth-pain-or-a-pain-in-the-butt-you-choose/,"“Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.”—Truman Capote When you fail, say, “Hallelujah! Glad I got that over with.”
I know. I know. You think I’ve lost it, right? But I haven’t. This is a counter-intuitive but highly tested approach to defeat. And it works. Here’s what I mean.
If you tried to collect all the tears shed by successful people who failed before building their careers, they would fill an ocean. There are days when hopelessness sets in after a failure to achieve a goal: an impossible deadline, a lousy review from your boss, a missed promotion or the rumble of your own self-doubt. You tell yourself you want to give up, but you don’t really want to quit. You just want the hurt and disappointment to stop, understandably so. At the time that might feel like the only option, but it isn’t. Perhaps you haven’t actually failed. Chances are, “failure” is what you call it when you don’t meet your career expectations, things don’t turn out the way you planned, or you’re simply traversing a valley that everyone goes through before reaching the mountain of success. Failure is heartbreaking, but it can also be an impetus to keep going. If you’ve never failed at something, how do you know when you’ve succeeded?
Failure Brings You Closer To Success
Baseball great Babe Ruth, arguably one of the best ball players of all time, said, “Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.” You can use Ruth’s wisdom in your pursuits when you “fail.” All successful people have smack down moments before and after they “make it.” When you face defeat, your outlook is everything. Failure is a frame of mind. When you call yourself a failure, you start to feel, think, and behave like one. As long as you’re still trying and haven’t quit, you haven’t failed. You fail only when you choose to put that label on yourself. When you feel as if you’ve failed, remember that you’re strong in those broken places, building firepower to succeed in your next career challenge. Each time you fail better than the time before, you build a stronger backbone. In the words of novelist J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, “Failure is so important. We speak of success all the time. It is the ability to resist failure or use failure that often leads to greater success.”
Cultivate A Growth Mindset
The buzz among psychologists is a phenomenon known as a growth mindset , basically a winning frame of mind that defeat happens for you, not to you. If you’re a successful career climber, you never give up. You welcome obstacles, setbacks and disappointments—no matter how painful, frustrating, big or small—as opportunities to grow and learn instead of as defeat. You think of failure as your personal trainer, asking yourself, “What can I learn about myself from this letdown that will help me grow?” or “What can I manage or overcome in this situation?” or “How can I turn this disappointment around to benefit my career?” You view success and failure as a package deal—like a hand and glove, milk and cookies, flipsides of the same coin—twins, not enemies. You understand that avoidance of failure morphs into avoidance of success. You realize that in order to attain what you want, you must be willing to accept what you don’t want. Acceptance motivates you to get up, one more time than you fall, take the towel you want to throw in, wipe the sweat from your brow and keep plugging away. Once you start to accept failure as an essential stepping-stone to job success, you give yourself permission to make the mistakes necessary to get where you want to go. If you want to be a successful leader, you learn from mistakes to make you stronger until you find the success you desire. Your growth mindset makes you as willing to embrace failure when it comes, as you are to accept success when it happens. The more you accept failure, the more opportunities you have to accept success and bounce back higher than you fall. And every time you fail—instead of giving up—try to do what every successful person before you did: keep swinging with your winning mindset until you hit your dreams out of the park."
Cambrie Schroder's Ultimate Guide To Coachella,www.forbes.com,Erica Wertheim Zohar,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericawertheimzohar/2019/04/12/cambrie-schroders-ultimate-guide-to-coachella/,"Cambrie and Faith at Coachella Cambrie Schroder An incredible 3-day musical line-up headlined by Ariana Grande , Childish Gambino , and Tame Impala might be the primary reason why thousands of twenty-somethings are flocking to the Coachella Valley, but the decadent parties, famous DJs, festival food, and non-stop fun are certainly a major draw as well. Experienced festival-goer Cambrie Schroder has learned over the years how to balance the partying with a healthy lifestyle. At 22, Cambrie did not become a major fitness influencer overnight. While modeling for brands such as Adidas, Victoria’s Secret, and Forever 21, Cambrie found that her real passion was living healthy and motivating the people around her to be active and engaged in living well. At the age of 16, she steadily began building her fitness company, Fit With Cambrie , and now teaches over 230,000 followers the benefits of living a healthy life through her personalized classes, motivational You Tube videos, meal plans, and merchandising. Her love for fitness has become a family affair. Her sister, Faith , is also a popular influencer who subscribes to the same goals of being fit. Coming from a family that has always been in front of the camera, the behind the scenes love and support from them has helped her get to where she is today. Cambrie Cambrie Schroder
As a veteran of Coachella, what are you doing differently this year than other years?
There is such a thing as a healthy partier! Most people don’t know how to do Coachella right. I have figured out out how to maximize fun with no downfall. This year my company Fit with Cambrie has partnered with Alo Yoga to create the first influencer Wellness House. Before going to the festival we will fill up on green juices and get our minds right with a quick yoga flow. It is all about maintaining balance and not getting too far off your routine. I think people also arrive too early to the festival and get burnt out before the night even begins! We are going to spend our mornings relaxing and going to some of the desert's coolest pool parties including the one I'm throwing with Vestal at Vestal Village ! This pool party is Tulum themed! You can expect all your favorite influencers to be there as well as acai bowls, coconut water, juices, and tequila! Workout with Cambrie Cambrie Schroder
What do you look forward to the most about Coachella?
I look forward to enjoying myself! I’ve worked so hard this year and have accomplished so much and can't wait to celebrate! I think that's why people love Coachella so much-because they can let loose and celebrate the year with their friends, while listening to their favorite music. Cambrie Schroder Cambrie Schroder
What are your must haves for packing for the 3-day music festival?
Must bring bandana and scarves to shield yourself from the dust! I also make sure I have cute and comfortable sneakers, boots, or flats like Rothys. You will be walking a lot and don’t have time for blisters! Also cute hats and sunscreen to avoid sunburns! Cambrie and Faith Cambrie Schroder
If you had to pick your top five parties to go to this year, what would they be?"
Impact Partners BrandVoice: The Key To Making Wise Decisions,www.forbes.com,Glenn Johnson,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/impactpartners/2019/04/12/the-key-to-making-wise-decisions/,"The decisions we make now determine the choices we’ll have in the future. If we want better options, we need to learn how to make better decisions. It starts at home. When a parent asks their child, “What would you like for dinner: chicken or fish?” two major things are happening. First, by the parent supplying the options, the adult is ultimately in control of what’s for dinner. Second, the child develops confidence in making simple, healthy decisions. Alternatively, if the parent just asks, “What would you like for dinner?” without supplying the options, the child is directed to consider what they feel like having as opposed to what is good for them, resulting in meals of pizza and ice cream.
The ability to consistently make wiser decisions will increase over time as we seek truth and wise counsel.
Getty Images Without proper guidance throughout our youth, we tend to make unhealthy decisions. If we don’t develop the ability to make wise decisions when we’re young, we can easily be emotionally manipulated as adults. Ultimately, we lose confidence in our own judgement and become slaves to our feelings. As a result, even simple decisions can be difficult, like deciding what color car to buy. Back in the day, when you went to buy a car, the salesman would ask, “What color would you like?” Today we’re often just asked, “Do you want a light color or dark color?” In fact, it’s because of this kind of indecisiveness that most new cars look the same: It’s just easier to have one less decision to make.
When it comes to making important life decisions, we can often feel overwhelmed and paralyzed. When our future is on the line and the solution isn’t staring us in the face, fear will usually lead us to another poor decision. The inability to make important decisions also weakens our ability to make strong commitments, which results in mediocrity in other areas of our lives.
Regardless of how prepared we feel we are, as adults we’re increasingly responsible for ourselves and to others. Therefore, our decisions need to be based on truth and not just our feelings. The ability to consistently make wiser decisions will increase over time as we seek truth and wise counsel. Whether it be in the areas of faith, family, friends, fitness, or finances, we make better decisions the more we’re able to trust wise and experienced advisors. Timeless wisdom has been passed down to us all for thousands of years, but it’s up to us to believe it.
Learning to trust can go against the grain emotionally because we’ve been conditioned to be skeptical and critical. Until we learn to trust in wise counsel, we’re left to our own devices, which often brings us back to the same place and costs us a great deal of time, money, and energy. We say to ourselves, “Boy, if I only knew then what I know now, how different things would be!” The fact is, many of us were told then what we now know. We just didn’t trust it, believe it, or feel like acting upon it. Now, it’s easy to admit that things could be better if we did things differently. That said, many people still find themselves doing similar things and making similar mistakes because their belief systems haven’t matured. Right or wrong, true or false, we are attached to our beliefs. Until our beliefs mature, we will stay where we are because we will not act in opposition to our beliefs for any extended period of time.
It’s no secret that if you want to see some permanent changes in your life, you’ve got to make some permanent changes in your life. Will power can get us started, but it’s not a permanent solution to changing our habits. Our habits will change as a by-product of our beliefs changing.
Therefore, I ask you: Would it be okay if your beliefs changed as a result of increased wisdom?
If we want to improve our trajectory toward more successful living in all areas of life, we must first seek the truth, regardless of how it makes us feel. We then need to discern in whom we can put our trust and decide whose advice to take. This can be very tricky when there are many honorable people with experience who love us and want to see us succeed but have vastly different opinions as to which approach we should take. After considering our potential advisor’s governing values and determining that they don’t contradict with truth, we can then decide for ourselves whose approach and process for success we believe will work best for us.
We will make better decisions and experience more success as we increase our knowledge, pursue truth, and develop an obsession for wisdom.

The Best Premium Credit Card In Each Category,www.forbes.com,The Points Guy,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/thepointsguy/2019/04/12/best-premium-each-category/,"Forbes has partnered with The Points Guy for our coverage of credit card products. Forbes and The Points Guy may receive a commission from card issuers.
The ever growing list of premium credit cards have more differences than similarities, with different cards being better suited to different types of travelers.
As the market continues to heat up, the formula for building a new premium credit card is getting much easier to identify. Start with an annual fee of $450 or more and a welcome bonus worth at least $1,000, then mix in a few hundred dollars in annual statement credits so the fee doesn't sting as much. Of course, don't forget to add a Priority Pass select membership and a Global Entry / TSA PreCheck application fee credit - you wouldn't want to be the only premium card not to offer these now ubiquitous perks.
Still, the ever growing list of premium credit cards have more differences than similarities, with different cards being better suited to different types of travelers. Here are my favorite premium rewards cards for each different category.
The Platinum Card® from American Express : Best For Lounge Access And Luxury Perks
Welcome bonus: Earn 60,000 Membership Rewards points after spending $5,000 in the first 3 months
Annual fee: $550
Where it excels: The Amex Platinum , the original premium credit card, continues to lead the field when it comes to luxury perks and travel enhancements. Cardholders enjoy a Priority Pass select membership as well as access to Amex's ever growing collection of Centurion lounges and access to Delta SkyClubs when flying on Delta. They also enjoy complimentary gold elite status at both Hilton and Marriott, allowing them to select the chain that offers the best combination of price and convenience and still be showered with bonus points, room upgrades, welcome amenities and more. While most premium credit cards offer some sort of concierge service , Amex's is a step above the rest when it comes to securing hard to get dining reservations or concert tickets, or providing you with in-depth city guides to help plan your next trip.
In addition to a welcome bonus which I value at $1,200, the Amex Platinum offers a great 5x bonus multiplier for airfare booked directly with the airline and prepaid hotels booked through amextravel.com The $550 annual fee is offset by a $200 annual airline incidental fee credit, a $200 annual Uber credit ($15 a month with a $20 bonus in December) and a $100 annual Saks Fifth Avenue statement credit ($50 semi-annually).
The Chase Sapphire Reserve : Best For Bonus Categories
Welcome bonus: Earn 50,000 Ultimate Rewards points after spending $4,000 in the first 3 months
Annual fee: $450
Where it excels: The Chase Sapphire Reserve has been a fan favorite ever since its launch, thanks to its simplicity, ease of use and broadly defined bonus categories. The Reserve offers 3x points on travel and dining (an upgrade from the 2x points on the Chase Sapphire Preferred ), but the kicker here is how broadly Chase defines these categories. ""Travel"" isn't limited to airfare and hotels, you'll earn bonus points on everything from Ubers and public transit to parking fees, select tour operators and even limo rentals. Similarly, ""dining"" means more than just restaurants, and you can expect to earn triple points at a wide variety of bars, food trucks and more.
The Sapphire Reserve's $450 annual fee is heavily reduced by a $300 annual travel credit. Like the bonus category, this is broadly defined and automatically applied to your account. You'll also enjoy Chase's top-line travel insurance benefits, including baggage loss and delay insurance, trip delay, cancellation and interruption insurance, and primary rental car insurance as well.
The Hilton Honors Aspire Card from American Express : Best For Elite Status
Welcome bonus: Earn 150,000 Hilton points after spending $4,000 in the first 3 months
Annual fee: $450
Where it excels: The Hilton Aspire card is one of the most compelling value propositions in the entire premium card landscape, and might be reason enough to shift your loyalty to Hilton. This is the only card to offer top-tier elite status automatically to cardholders, who all receive Hilton Diamond status. It's also one of the only cards who's statement credits are worth more than the cost of the annual fee, meaning you can actually make money by holding this card. In exchange for a $450 annual fee you'll receive a $250 annual airline incidental fee credit, a $250 annual Hilton resort statement credit at participating hotels and a $100 property credit on eligible stays of 2 or more nights at Waldorf Astoria and Conrad hotels. That's at least $600 in credits a year, before we even start to talk about the card's other benefits.
The Aspire has the best earning rate at Hilton properties, with a whopping 14x points per dollar spent. New applicants will receive one free weekend night certificate (valid at almost any Hilton property) on account approval, and another each year when they renew their account.
The Business Platinum® Card from American Express : Most Valuable Welcome Bonus
Welcome bonus: Earn up to 75,000 Membership Rewards points, 50,000 after spending $10,000 and another 25,000 after spending $20,000 total, all within the first 3 months.
Annual fee: $595
Where it excels: When it comes to immediate value, there's no replacing a good old fashioned high powered welcome bonus. While it requires $20,000 of spending in three months, no premium card measures up to the Amex Business Platinum here. I value Membership Rewards points at 2 cents each , making this bonus worth $1,500. While $20,000 is a lot to spend, it's perfectly reasonable for a business with high expenses.
The Business Platinum comes with two great points multipliers, offering 5x points on prepaid hotels booked through amextravel.com and a 50% points bonus on purchases over $5,000. It comes with the same lounge access and elite status perks as the personal Platinum , but it also includes a 35% rebate when you use your points to pay for airfare (any premium cabin ticket or economy tickets on your selected airline), up to $200 in annual statement credits for Dell technology purchases, and a free year of WeWork access.

"Agents Offer Writers Cash, Threaten Lawsuits Ahead Of Contract Deadline",www.forbes.com,Jill Goldsmith,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgoldsmith/2019/04/12/agents-offer-writers-cash-threaten-lawsuits-ahead-of-contract-deadline/,"Talent agents made concessions then threatened legal action in a last ditch carrot-and-stick attempt to push through a new contract with the Writers Guild of America. There’s been no word yet from the powerful writers’ union, which swore that midnight tonight was the one-and-only extension of talks to hash out the parties’ first new contract in 43 years. A letter to the WGA from law firm Latham&Watkins on behalf of the Association of Talent Agents (ATA) slammed the Guild’s proposed workaround, if talks fail, to deputize managers and attorneys to act temporarily as agents. The firm said that violates New York and California State law, under which only licensed talent agents are allowed to find work and negotiate payment for clients. The ATA “considers any and all unlawful procurement entered into at the behest of the WGA to be unfair and unlawful competition that will harm the ATA and its member agencies. Accordingly we demand the immediate retraction of the WGA’s purported “delegation.” ATA will take appropriate action as needed against any person engaged in unfair competition to protect the lawful interests of its members,” the letter said.
In response, the WGA said: “The Guild stands by its action in lawfully delegating the authority it has as the exclusive representative of writers under federal law. The agencies are attempting to intimidate attorneys and managers to stop them from performing work they routinely do.”
The two sides are planning to meet at 3 pm, according to The Hollwyood Reporter, cutting things a bit close.
The missive, which may indeed scare managers and attorneys from stepping in for agents, followed a proposal from the ATA late Thursday night agreeing to share fees that agencies get from packaging—a longstanding but increasingly controversial practice where studios pay agencies to assemble talent for shows. Specifically, agencies agreed to give writers a percentage of their back-end profit in packaging deals. In an email shared with members, the ATA, did not quantify the percentage. THR said it is 1%.
ATA executive director Karen Stuart said in the email that the handful of concessions therein described came after time reflecting on writers’ “fundamental issues of concern, including calls for greater transparency, deeper understanding of agency operations, increased support for lower and mid-level writers and ultimately better alignment in agent/writer compensation.” The ATA had also reflected on the prospect of writers firing their agents en masse if no agreement is reached. That scenario, of a so-called hard ‘Wrexit,’ has been spooking Hollywood for weeks.
The ATA said that 80% of the reported 1% packaging fees it has agreed to share will go to writers that don’t already participate in the profits of shows, regardless of which agency represents them. The remaining 20% will be invested in industry initiatives to expand inclusion of historically underrepresented writers. The ATA will also advance $6 million over three years to jumpstart an industry fund to foster inclusion.
The other big sticking point in talks has been major agencies moving into production. The WGA called that a major conflict of interest since it puts agencies in a dual role as writers’ bosses and representatives.
Agencies won’t exit the business but agreed to provide “safeguards and transparency,” including sharing anonymized data and summaries of financial terms and contracts when their own production companies hire writers. It agreed to quarterly meetings with the WGA to discuss how agency production is benefitting writers and said the union could reopen negotiations on this after two years if it wasn’t happy.
In addition, the ATA said agencies performing motion picture consulting, financing and sales services will fully disclose any fees and arrangements to the writer.
The ATA agreed to the WGA’s request for access to client contracts and invoices as long as writers are allowed to opt-out. The ideas is that the Guild should be able to intervene directly with studios and employers on behalf of writers to rectify situations like requests for free rewrites or late payments.
“At this critical juncture, we are committed to getting a deal across the finish line. We are intensely focused on ensuring that it’s a long-term solution — one that meets a dual-purpose of protecting the best interests of all writers while creating alignment between the goals of our two organizations,” Stuart said."
MSNBC Cements Its Lead Over CNN: 'We Couldn't Be More Proud',www.forbes.com,Mark Joyella,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/markjoyella/2019/04/12/msnbc-cements-its-lead-over-cnn-we-couldnt-be-more-proud/,"For decades, when news broke during the day, CNN was there to dominate the story. The network, unrestrained as the legacy broadcast networks were by the need to interrupt programming to deliver a special report, CNN had the luxury of staying with a story as long as it wanted, becoming synonymous with “breaking news” for viewers who wanted to turn on the television and find out instantly what was going on. Cable news has shifted from covering news in prime-time to producing news-themed entertainment shows, where opinion hosts led by Fox News Channel’s top-rated lineup of Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham attract millions of loyal viewers night after night. But between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET on weekdays, there remains a sizable audience looking for information without spin and free from panels of partisans shouting talking points at each other. This is the audience CNN was built to serve, and yet, recent ratings data show the network that created cable news hasn't just lost its place as first choice for news viewers in daytime television (to Fox News), but has drifted into a steady third place behind the rapidly rising MSNBC.
For the first quarter of 2019, only two networks in all of cable television delivered an average daytime audience over one million viewers: Fox News (1.527 million) and MSNBC (1.186 million), with MSNBC posting double-digit ratings growth (up 17 percent in 1Q 2019 compared to the same period one year ago).
“We couldn’t be more proud to have every hour of our daytime programming hit all-time record viewership,” said Janelle Rodriguez, senior vice president, editorial, for NBC News and MSNBC. “Our audience is incredibly engaged and wants real insight when they turn on the news.”
MSNBC set out to steal CNN's lunch four years ago, when the network shifted gears away from partisan political talk in daytime to a focus on hard news intended to attract an audience more comfortable at the time with NBC News than its cable news sister, MSNBC. The huge shift was put in place by Andy Lack, who returned as NBC News chairman in 2015. Lack inherited a fourth-place network and believed reporting--and a fierce emphasis on breaking news in daytime--could turn around the network's lagging ratings. The idea included bringing many of NBC News' most familiar faces to MSNBC, along with a group of young reporters who used the 2016 presidential campaign as a proving ground, and making names not just for themselves, but the re-designed MSNBC as well.
MSNBC’s timing was good: the network’s daytime viewership began growing rapidly, and reaching a virtual tie with CNN in 2017, and pulling ahead in 2018, outperforming not just CNN, but Nickelodeon as well, to move into second place overall behind Fox News.
In ratings compiled by Nielsen for 1Q 2019, MSNBC’s lead over CNN was comprehensive, hitting ratings highs among total viewers for its daytime lineup—most of them shows created in the years since the 2015 shift to hard news: MSNBC Live with Hallie Jackson , MSNBC Live with Craig Melvin , Andrea Mitchell Reports , MSNBC Live with Velshi & Ruhle , MSNBC Live with Katy Tur , MTP Daily with Chuck Todd , and The Beat with Ari Melber .
Another show, Deadline: White House with Nicolle Wallace, finished the first quarter in first place among total viewers, though Wallace, a political insider who served as communications director in the Bush White House, serves as the insider host interviewing journalists.
A year ago, MSNBC president Phil Griffin told me the re-boot toward hard news had built a stronger network, driving loyalty among viewers and creating a culture built around breaking news, particularly in the dayside hours--but with the added benefit of producing reporting that can be covered in prime. ""We made a strategic decision three years ago to focus on breaking news during the day and to strengthen our partnership with NBC News,"" Griffin told me. ""That's paid off in a big way. We've had more exclusives, better coverage overall and record ratings in dayside.""
Putting top talent into the mix in daytime has been exceptionally valuable in the Trump era, when the president makes much of his news during banking hours, either via Twitter or his off-the-cuff commentary whenever he stands before a bank of cameras, either assembled to watch him walk from the White House to Marine One, or at any of the various signing ceremonies or public appearances where Trump can be counted on to break from the intended White House messaging to launch attacks on his rivals.
In that ecosystem, it's not inconceivable that MSNBC could continue to see ratings growth throughout 2019. Whether MSNBC will continue to benefit from flat or declining ratings among its competitors remains to be seen. Could MSNBC eventually close the gap on first place?"
How To Find Great Mentors (A Step-By-Step Guide For Not-Yet-Successful People In 2019),www.forbes.com,Steli Efti,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/steliefti/2019/04/12/how-to-find-great-mentors-a-step-by-step-guide-for-not-yet-successful-people-in-2019/,"If you’re trying to connect with great mentors, it’s going to take more than a cold email and a prayer. There’s one thing you must have: Follow-up.
When it comes to finding great mentors, the truth is this:
Building real relationships takes time and effort.
If your goal is to build long-lasting relationships with influential people who can help you grow personally and professionally, it’s going to take more than a quick five-minute conversation at a conference.
Yes—the first interaction is important.
You want to make a great first impression, but if you’re expecting to create that long-lasting bond with a potential mentor the very first time you meet them, prepare to be disappointed.
“If I can just ask the perfect question, it’s a lock—we’ll be best friends forever.”
Hate to break it to you, but there is no one perfect question that can instantly create a real relationship that stands the test of time.
But here’s the good news:
There is a three-step formula you can use to meet your dream mentors and build real connections over time.
My formula for finding great mentors Before we dive into the process, understand one thing:
Without ambition , it doesn’t matter what you do—there will always be someone else who’s outworking you. If you want to find great mentors who are committed to seeing you succeed, you need to be willing to put in the work.
Now let’s break down the three-step process:
Show up. Follow up. Follow through. Show up in order to meet the people you want to connect with, follow up with those people to keep the conversation going, then follow through on what you said you would do.
Skip any of these three steps and your chances of finding a mentor who’s willing to invest in you will drop like a rock.
The first step?
Laying the groundwork.
Step 1: Show up A great relationship with a mentor who can change your life and your career isn’t going to fall into your lap. If you want to find a mentor, you need to show up .
Go to that local meetup.
Buy a ticket for that conference.
Send an email to that founder, CEO, CMO, etc.
If you never show up in the first place, there’ll be no one to follow up and follow through with. Find the people you want to connect with, and reach out.
You don’t need to craft a perfectly articulated pitch before you show up. Do your research, yes (more on that later), but don’t write up talking points on notecards. The truth is, what you say when you introduce yourself is much less important than just saying something in the first place.
Keep this in mind:
Even though it’s the first step in process, showing up is really only a small piece of the pie. It’s the foot in the door you need to kickstart a relationship, but the real relationship building comes next.
Step 2: Follow up Congrats—you got through the first step. You’ve laid the foundation for some awesome relationships with awesome people who can help you grow.
Here’s the harsh truth:
You’re one of 100 people they spent a few minutes chatting with last night at the conference. You’re just a name they may or may not remember, and if you don’t keep nurturing this seedling of a relationship, that’s all you’ll ever be to your dream mentors—a face they’ll forget by next week.
Don’t put your feet up and call it a day. If you don’t follow up , someone else will, and your efforts to show up and start a conversation will go to waste.
That doesn’t have to be the case.
To follow up, just send a simple email like this:
“Hey Steli, thanks again for chatting with me last weekend. Based on your advice, I added a few new sections to our pitch deck and we’ve already closed two new deals since!
Quick question: How long would you recommend waiting to hear back from a prospect who asked for time to consider their options?”
You don’t need to send fancy charts or a complex spreadsheet—just let them know you appreciate their advice, tell them how you’re doing and keep the conversation moving.
Step 3: Follow through You put in the work to show up and meet a potential mentor. You kept the momentum going by following up with a quick thank-you and an update.
What’s next?
Do what you said you would do, and keep them in the loop about it.
If you ask someone for their advice, and they give it— do something with it. That doesn’t mean you have to implement exactly what they suggested, but it does mean you should seriously consider what they said and look for ways to apply their wisdom.
They recommended tweaking your company’s pitch deck?
Update them on the edits you ended up making and tell them how results have changed since then.
They suggested you reach out to a marketing expert for advice?
Let them know you connected with that expert and share some of the advice they gave you.
They shared a few resources to help you out?
Actually read them (seriously—don’t fake it) and send a few follow-up questions you wrote down.
The bottom line is this:
Even if you only talked for 20 minutes, they’ve invested time in you. They were kind enough to offer some advice, so keep in touch to let them know what’s happening.
What’s working?
What’s not working?
What has you most excited?
What are you still struggling with?
If instead you drop off the face of the earth until you want more advice a few months later, good luck maintaining that relationship long-term.
Here’s your homework: If you want to find great mentors and build a relationship that can help both of you, here’s what you need to do next:
Create a Dream 20 list of people you want to connect with Formulate a list of 20 people you would love to build relationships with. They can be startup founders, local business owners, thought leaders in your industry—just find 20 people you want to reach.
Spend time researching that Dream 20 list You have 20 names—now start learning as much as you can about each of them. How did they start their careers? What are they writing or talking about most often? What advice would you love to get from them?
Do not speed through this part. If you don’t do your research, you’ll have no clue what to say when you get in touch.
Find their contact information and reach out If there’s an opportunity to meet them at a conference or an event, find a way to show up. If not, look for their email online and show up in their inbox. If you’ve done your research, you’ll already know what to say in that first conversation or message.
Do these three things, leave a comment below and tell me how it goes. Remember— always follow up and always follow through."
Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg Faces His Greatest Challenge,www.forbes.com,Jeremy Bogaisky,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2019/04/12/boeing-ceo-dennis-muilenburg-faces-his-greatest-challenge/,"Dennis Muilenburg has earned a reputation as a high-energy CEO, bicycling 140 miles a week, sometimes taking groups of employees along for high-speed bonding sessions. The 55-year-old may need every ounce of energy he’s got as he faces one of the worst crises for Boeing in over 50 years: two crashes that killed 346 people, linked to the automated flight controls of the 737 MAX and leading to the grounding of the company’s bestselling plane. The stakes for Boeing, and its CEO, are huge. The 737 accounts for 33% of Boeing’s revenue and almost 50% of its profit, according to Berenberg analyst Andrew Gollan. Deliveries have been halted since the plane was taken out of service worldwide after the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines plane, airlines are demanding compensation, and the company faces scrutiny from Congress, a Department of Transportation inquiry and a federal criminal probe. The stock (BA) has fallen 10%. Lawsuits filed by relatives of the dead and shareholders could take years to conclude.
Over the past few weeks, the 34-year Boeing veteran has been traveling heavily to shore up support from airline customers and investors. An aerospace engineer by training, Muilenburg has kept a close eye on the Boeing team rewriting the faulty flight control program; last week he went up in a plane that tested out its effectiveness.
But many observers are giving Boeing and Muilenburg poor marks for their public handling of the crisis. Until late last week, Muilenburg was largely invisible and the company’s public statements, while expressing sympathy for family and friends of the deceased, were short on substance.
“I give them a B,” says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor of leadership at the Yale School of Management. Muilenburg needs to put a human face on Boeing, he says, and get out in public and engage with the media to try to correct misperceptions and address the many questions about what went wrong, even if he doesn’t have ready answers to offer.
Muilenburg hasn’t shown the media sophistication of his predecessor, Jim McNerney, who’d previously helmed GE’s prized aircraft engine division and 3M. “He’s got a catastrophe as his training ground,” says Sonnenfeld.
Preliminary reports from the investigations into the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 in October and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 last month suggest that the pilots of both planes struggled to counter a flight control program called MCAS that erroneously pushed the planes’ noses down due to malfunctioning angle-of-attack sensors. After Ethiopian investigators released their report last Thursday, Boeing put out a video statement by Muilenburg in which he said Boeing accepted responsibility for the role that MCAS played as one of the “chain links” in the two accidents.
Aviation regulators in other countries have questioned the Federal Aviation Administration’s certification of the MCAS system and its initial reluctance to pull the 737 MAX out of service; several have said they won’t just take the FAA’s word that it’s safe to fly again, making it uncertain when the plane will return to the skies worldwide.
With the prospects of a quick resolution fading, Boeing announced last Friday it would throttle back 737 production to 42 a month from 52—a sharp reversal from its plan to raise output to 57 by the summer.
Analyst Richard Epstein of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock to neutral Monday, estimating that Boeing likely won’t be able to resume deliveries for six months and won’t get back on pace until 2021, reducing earnings through 2023 before interest and taxes by $13.7 billion.
Whether Muilenburg’s job is threatened or not may depend on the stock price, says Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group.
The board is loyal to Muilenburg, observers say, and his record so far has given them little reason to doubt having signed off on then-CEO and chairman McNerney’s decision to promote him to the top job in 2015 at age 51.
Engineer With Focus On Financial Discipline Workers stand under the wing of a Boeing 737 MAX airplane at the Boeing Renton Factory in Renton, Washington on March 27, 2019. Boeing gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters at its factory to unveil a fix to the flight software of its grounded 737
AFP/Getty Images The hard-charging, detail-oriented engineer presented a strong contrast to McNerney, a liberal arts major at Yale and Harvard M.B.A. who rose up through the ranks at General Electric when it was a star factory under Jack Welch. Native to Iowa, Muilenburg grew up milking cows every morning on his family farm and graduated from Iowa State before going straight to work at Boeing. Health-conscious and rail thin, he drinks Diet Mountain Dew to get a calorie-free caffeine fix and has been known to order turkey sandwiches with no mayo.
Though he’s cut head count, Muilenburg has cultivated a more positive relationship with the workforce than McNerney, who clashed with the machinist’s union and infamously joked of workers “cowering” from him.
However, Muilenburg has followed in McNerney’s footsteps with a laser focus on financial discipline, including boosting profits by wringing discounts from suppliers. Muilenburg has even gone a step further , moving to make more components in house and aiming to more than triple sales from lucrative aftermarket maintenance and services to $50 billion a year.
Like his two predecessors, Muilenberg has continued to sweeten the pot for investors, devoting roughly 95% of operating cash flow to the company’s steadily rising dividend and share buybacks.
The stock has taken off, climbing fourfold from February 2016 to a peak of $446 at the beginning of March, compared with a 63% rise for the Dow industrials over the same period. The March selloff has only pushed the stock back to where it stood at the end of January.
But to Aboulafia, the flawed design of the MCAS flight control system, combined with the continuing problems with the KC-46 tanker and delays in the crewed space-launch program are further evidence for criticism he’s leveled at Boeing for almost two decades: that the company’s focus on shareholder rewards has come with a “deprioritization and perhaps under-resourcing of engineering.”
Boeing says it’s maintained R&D spending at a steady level and has a healthy corps of 56,000 engineers.
The question of how MCAS was certified has raised concerns over whether Boeing has gained too cozy a relationship with the FAA; a wildcard going forward is whether any evidence of wrongdoing will emerge.
If whistleblowers had any damaging information we likely would have heard it by now, says Mark Dombroff, an aviation attorney at LeClairRyan and former head of the Department of Justice’s aviation division. He expects that the DoJ will seek to determine within 90 to 120 days whether there’s a case to pursue.
Aviation experts are optimistic that Boeing’s software patch and training revisions will solve the 737 MAX’s safety problems. Boeing's disclosure this week that it logged zero orders for the MAX in March generated negative headlines, but with a whopping 15,000 total narrow-body orders placed over the past seven years, there aren’t really any airlines left with sizable needs , says Aboulafia, with the notable exception of Chinese carriers. Any trade deal between the U.S. and China that would change the balance of trade will likely include Boeing sales.
Boeing’s last major crisis came in 2013, when the 787 was grounded for three months due to battery fires, two years after the plane entered service following years of production snafus and spiraling costs. While the financial stakes were large, no lives were lost. The last time Boeing faced a safety crisis of a comparable nature to the current one was the mid-1960s, when four new 727 jets crashed in a span of four months.
Like then, Boeing faces the task of convincing a fearful public that the MAX will be safe to step into again. Sonnenfeld says Muilenberg needs to take a page from James Burke, the late CEO of Johnson & Johnson, who pulled off the tall task of convincing Americans that Tylenol was still safe after seven people were killed by cyanide-laced capsules in 1982. “It’s going to take the CEO to be out there.”"
Can Alicia Vikander's 'Tomb Raider 2' Avoid The 'Tomb Raider' Trap?,www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/04/12/tomb-raider-alicia-vikander-angelina-jolie-box-office-video-games-gerard-butler-daniel-craig/,"Well, this is a surprise. Deadline reports that MGM has hired Amy Jump to pen a sequel to last year's Tomb Raider reboot. The film was a modest ground-rule double, earning $56 million domestic but overperforming overseas (including $78.4 million in China) for a $274.65 million global cume. That was about even (sans inflation) with Angelina Jole's first Tomb Raider ($274.7 million in 2000) and was 2.92x its $94 million production budget. Whether the Alicia Vikander flick performed well in post-theatrical or MGM just wants more franchises for the sake of having more franchises, this is an interesting development. As someone who liked the last Tomb Raider but felt that Vikander's winning Lara Croft deserved more than just an origin story rehash, this is relatively good news. Jump is best known for co-writing Ben Wheatley's movies ( Free Fire , Kill List and High-Rise among others). Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons penned the first flick, which was a loose adaptation of the rebooted Tomb Raider video game, and we can hope that they hire a female director this time out.
Warner Bros. released the previous Tomb Raider , while the Jolie flicks (including The Cradle of Life in 2003) were courtesy of Paramount/Viacom. I do not know if they will be distributing this one as well, but I'd bet on it accordingly. If you recall, Tomb Raider was one of a handful of would-be event movies that got steamrolled (especially in North America) by Black Panther and its Titanic -like monopoly on domestic filmmaking dollars from mid-February to late March.
Simon West's first Tomb Raider movie, which gave us a very young Daniel Craig, was pretty terrible (and clearly mangled in post-production), but hype, interest and a prime star+character combo pushed it to a $47 million debut (huge even in 2001) in June of 2001. It was frontloaded, but it still sits with $131 million domestic as the biggest-grossing video game-based movie ever in North America. I'm presuming it's about to lose that crown to Detective Pikachu in a few weeks, but I digress.
The Cradle of Life was a far superior action-adventure flick, with a fine foil in Gerard Butler, but audiences had been burned once already and the film earned just $65 million domestic and $156 million domestic on a $95 million budget. It's a phenomenon, where a lousy franchise starter is a big hit thanks to hype and interest only to see the superior sequel pay for its artistic shortcomings, that I call the Tomb Raider Trap. Think, for example, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. That 2016 release bombed with $235 million worldwide despite being everything we wanted from the $495 million-grossing TMNT movie two years prior.
So while the first Tomb Raider was squarely ""okay,"" we'll see if A) the sequel will be better and B) if folks will be willing to show up a second time. In essence, can Tomb Raider 2 (or whatever it's called) avoid the Tomb Raider Trap? It's frankly a coin toss, as this may look like, on paper, the kind of ""just because the first one made money doesn't mean folks want a sequel"" scenario, as we saw last year with Pacific Rim: Uprising . Still, if you're one of those folks crowing about the possibility of a gender-bent Indiana Jones or 007, you might want to actually show up for a new Lara Croft movie, since she's not just a female version of a famously male action hero."

Three Ways To Learn Like A CEO On An Intern's Budget,www.forbes.com,Laurel Donnellan,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/laureldonnellan/2019/04/12/three-ways-to-learn-like-a-ceo-on-an-interns-budget/,"If you are not learning, you are not leading. Being a compassionate leader requires you to be a proactive life-long learner, to stay informed on things that will affect the people you influence, your stakeholders. If your company provides a generous professional development budget and time off to learn, lucky you.
However, many professionals do not have this perk and must find ways of learning that are high impact and low cost in order to stay current, develop leadership skills and advance careers. There are many online options including Udemy , Coursera and LinkedIn Learning . However, when you find live in-person opportunities there is a built-in benefit of meeting new people while you gain an education.
Although taking classes online is convenient, learning in the real world can offer additional perks. It can be more fun, the food is often better at these venues than at your computer and some people retain more when they are in a three-dimensional classroom or event.
Here are three ways to finding professional development that will not break your budget while providing you opportunities to expand your network:
Attend alumni events, conferences and speaker series. Often universities have local chapters that curate great monthly events at a reasonable price, in addition to their bigger annual events. Last Fall, I attended the annual Cornell Entrepreneurship Summit in New York City. This world-class program blended talks from top tier executives as well as a pitch contest featuring new tech breakthroughs. The price was $300 for professionals and $50 for students. Attend your dream conference as a volunteer, speaker, fellow or scholarship recipient. First, based on your interests, create a list of dream conferences or events you would like to attend and then, investigate options to participate in a way that is affordable through their website or contact organizers directly. My list includes TED , PopTech , Social Venture Circle and The Nantucket Project and I have been very fortunate to attend two of the four so far, one as a guest of my employer and one, at a discount in consideration of my status as a start-up founder, earlier in my career. Normally, tickets for these events range from $1,665 to $10,000 per participant. Attend or create local classes and events. Two of my dream conference organizations have created opportunities to attend or create programs locally that are much more affordable and accessible. TED has spun off TEDx , and The Nantucket Project has created The Neighborhood Project that provides the tools to create events using their films. My friends and I are using my living room once a month to hold these free programs and they have been enjoyable and informative. In addition, you can explore classes and educational events in your area through schools, local press, coworking spaces and Eventbrite . To keep on track, develop annual goals for professional development and plan to attend at least one class or educational event each month."
"How Will EVA Change Performance Metrics, If At All?",www.forbes.com,Robin Ferracone,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robinferracone/2019/04/12/how-will-eva-change-performance-metrics-if-at-all/,"Getty A Once-Popular Performance Metric May Be Returning – and It Has Implications for Executive Pay
EVA (Economic Value Added) may be making a comeback as a performance measure for companies, and this matters for compensation governance. Though popular in the 1990s, EVA fell out of favor over the past two decades and is today used as a measure by fewer than 10 percent of companies. But the acquisition of equity research firm EVA Dimensions by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), one of the two top proxy advisory firms, in February 2018 resurrected the possibility of EVA returning as a major force in performance measurement. According to an ISS paper published last month entitled “Using EVA in Pay-for-Performance Analysis, ISS plans to present EVA metrics for informational purposes in the 2019 proxy season. The ISS report highlights that they will compute, report and analyze a set of EVA metrics, and include them in this year’s proxy reports while continuing to seek guidance from institutional investors regarding the value they see in EVA metrics for future use. The return of EVA could have major implications for how boards, proxy advisors and equity analysts decide on executive compensation, as it would raise the issue of the rules of the game and the definition of good performance being changed at a stroke. Companies and investors should pay close – and educate (or re-educate) themselves on EVA’s fundamentals.
What Is EVA And What Are Its Benefits?
EVA is equal to Net Operating Profit after Tax (NOPAT), minus [Total Capital (TC) x Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)].
Sample EVA Calculation
Farient Advisors, LLC.
This equation enables the tracking of value creation from one period to the next, including “apples-to-apples” comparisons of companies with significantly different business models and capital structures. Tying executive compensation to EVA allows for boards and shareholders to see clearer correlations between executive performance and pay. EVA has advantages over other, more widely-used measures such as the GAAP earnings, which fails to account for significant company differences, and stock prices, which track only perceptions which may or may not have much at all to do with management activities and achievements.
To create value under the EVA performance metric, earnings must grow more than the return required by investors on any new capital invested. In other words, a 20 percent growth in earnings is much more likely to drive up value if it is achieved with minimal capital expenditure than if it is the result of a major acquisition. This excludes major “one-off” increases in how much a company is worth which result from spending more money, instead focusing on how executives generate growth through less costly, more sustainable means. This was a major reason why investors embraced EVA in the 1990s when they built evaluation models around the principle of measuring earnings relative to the cost of capital, and whether value was really being created or it was merely the “smoke and mirrors” of acquisitions or temporary spending sprees.
EVA was also used by many companies in their incentive plans by essentially awarding management a defined share of EVA growth over time. This EVA plan worked particularly well for large, multi-divisional, capital-intensive firms, promising an enduring, definitive linkage between management rewards and value creation. Once calibrated, this mechanism could operate without budget-based goal setting or any significant plan changes over many years. For example, Genesco has had its EVA plan in place for nearly two decades, while Ball Corporation is going on its third decade. This longevity is itself a benefit, with EVA companies knowing that they will reap the rewards of profits exceeding the capital used to generate them, even if it takes years for their projects to mature. This extends management’s time horizon beyond the end of the fiscal year, enabling it to effectively balance short-term and long-term imperatives.
Why Did EVA Fall Out Of Favor?
The Dot-Com boom of the late 1990s exposed one weakness of EVA when the burgeoning tech companies saw value creation heavily lag investment for multiples years in a row. (This issue is once again extremely relevant given the new generation of tech companies – such as Uber’s planned IPO and Lyft’s recent IPO – which are moving into the public realm while having multi-billion-dollar yearly losses). EVA is also a non-standard measure, subject to numerous adjustments, which increase complexity for management while stoking suspicion of possible fiddling among investors. Finally, any incentive plan is only popular if it is paying out. In the wake of the dot-com bust in 2001, many bonus plans, including EVA plans, were dropped. By the time business began to recover in the early 2000s, new standards for accounting and compensation programs had grown up that would run counter to the EVA philosophy and mechanics, including a lower tolerance for non-GAAP metrics driving incentives.
Is EVA Here To Stay?
In spite of these drawbacks, many investors and governance experts have long remained interested in bringing EVA back as a widely-used metric. EVA bonuses require management to overcome a capital hurdle before getting paid, which is attractive to fund managers looking to hold management to a higher standard. And ISS is in the business of creating governance standards, including for compensation governance, to advise their investor clients how to vote their proxies.
With ISS starting to incorporate EVA as a performance metric, companies and their boards will have to invest in learning or refreshing themselves this metric. Companies can prepare for the advent EVA, and potential renewed interest in it by investors, by taking the following steps:
Calculate both a “basic EVA” (as ISS is likely to calculate it across all companies) as well as an “adjusted EVA” (based on NOPAT, Capital, and Cost of Capital suitable to your sector) to see where they would stack up Determine the degree to which their EVA level or growth trends provide an accurate reflection of company value creation over the last three-to-five years Prepare to explain the company’s position on the applicability of EVA as a measure in shareholder engagement activities, including in disclosures and other communications, as appropriate Some companies with the right set of characteristics noted earlier may even find that EVA is a better metric than the one(s) they are currently using. And with the mandate by ISS, they will have an easier time justifying tracking and reporting it, and even building it into their reward system."

"Is Bullpen Standing Between Dodgers And A Championship, Again?",www.forbes.com,Howard Cole,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardcole/2019/04/12/is-bullpen-standing-between-dodgers-and-a-championship-again/,"Here’s to hoping the Dodgers have bottomed out, that losing four in St. Louis is the worst of it. It has to be, right? You know, since they don't have any five-game series on the schedule. Cards pitchers cooled hot Dodgers bats — which happens — Monday through Wednesday while starters Kenta Maeda and Ross Stripling struggled and Hyun-Jin Ryu hit the injured list with a bum groin. Walker Buehler pitched like a man making his third spring start of the year (which he was) in game four Thursday. And the bullpen was a mess the entire time.
The bullpen is a mess just plain generally, everybody, and I’m beginning to think it’s Andrew Friedman’s Kryptonite. It’s his Waterloo. Or perhaps, like Steve Sax with the throwing that one year; you can’t explain Friedman’s bullpen construction, but you know it’s a recurring problem and he just can't help himself. It’s like a personnel man’s version of the yips. And it might be the difference between a championship team and, well, something less than. Again.
While I wrote that it was way too early to panic eight days ago , that’s out the window now.
Look, obviously it’s just four games we’re focusing on here, but with the previous 10 included we've seen enough of a sample size to say that the pen as constituted is a loser. I’m sorry, but Yimi Garcia simply is not a major leaguer. JT Chargois, promoted-and-demoted-already-from-and-to-Oklahoma-City, is not a major leaguer. Banished-but-given-a-role-he-wasn't-qualified-for-earlier Brock Stewart is not a major leaguer. Pedro Baez is an up and down pitcher and right now he’s down. Joe Kelly is an up and down pitcher who at the moment is down. Caleb Ferguson, Dylan Floro, Kenley Jansen, and to some extent Scott Alexander are A-OK.
Jeremy Hellickson is a major league pitcher who was available all winter long, and for a song. I mentioned him twice in January ( here and here ) so this isn’t a second guess. Depth is a talking point ad infinitum, remember? An extra starter allows for an extra reliever; say, Mr. Stripling or Julio Urias. Bud Norris is a major league relief pitcher available as we speak. He doesn’t have a Cy Young Award on his resume but he’s a major league pitcher who can be in the fold this afternoon. So what’s the hold-up? Craig Kimbrel and Dallas Keuchel are expensive alternatives, but as I’ve often said, I’ll glad pay an extra fifty cents for a Dodger Dog; a buck if they actually cook the thing all the way through. Desperate times, right? There are always things you can do. Always . So what’s the hold-up?
Ideally, Ryu misses just the one start and Julio Urias heads to the pen where he can be relied upon. Ideally, Clayton Kershaw returns Monday, pitches six or seven good innings and Stripling goes to the pen where he can be relied upon. Ideally, Rich Hill comes back solid a week or so afterwards and the Dodgers have a surplus of pitching of one kind or another. And no more bodies fall. Or none of the same bodies fall a second time.
I don’t know how much of the above can be expected to occur — especially the part about bodies not falling —and under the suggested timelines, but in the interim I’d like to see changes. I’d like to see actual major league pitchers coming to Los Angeles. There are applicants out there waiting for the phone to ring. It’s not that complicated. See pitcher, employ pitcher. Skip the men with long injury histories in favor of the ones with histories of success.
A troublesome bullpen is not a division loser, necessarily, and a four-game losing streak is meaningless in the grand scheme of things. But Friedman’s relief pitcher issues have gone on long enough. The definition of insanity is Yimi Garcia and Chris Hatcher and Ryan Madson. Wilmer Font and Josh Ravin and Jim Johnson. Joel Peralta and Nick Tepesch and John Axford. Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!
I could continue with the list of incompetents, but I’ll spare you. You’re frightened enough already. This isn’t rocket science, people. Or brain surgery. But if I needed one of those types of professionals, I can assure you it wouldn’t be Andrew Friedman. Or Yimi Garcia.
And remember, glove conquers all."

4 Biggest Mistakes Most People Make with Credit Card Rewards
A new study by NerdWallet shows how many misconceptions people have about rewards programs, which could be setting them up for serious disappointment, or worse. The study found two in five people believe carrying a balance won't affect the value of rewards. Many Americans don't know how much points or miles are really worth. Younger consumers are more likely to overestimate sign-up bonuses . Less than half of consumers would use credit card points for flights. [ MarketWatch ]
Delta Expects to Make $7 Billion From Its Amex Credit Card Relationship by 2023. But How?
Delta Air Lines is promising investors it can earn up to $7 billion by 2023 from its new credit card contract with American Express, about double this year's haul. But it'll only see that much money if it meets certain performance goals. Banks typically pay airlines a fixed price per mile, often between 1.25 and 1.50 cents, which they buy directly from the carriers and give as a reward to their customers. Banks may also pay incentives based on the number of new cardholders who sign up. [ Skift ]
Chase Freedom Card Sweetens the Rewards for New Customers
As competition in the credit card industry increases, so do the benefits for consumers. The Chase Freedom Card is the latest to ratchet up rewards for cardholders. The card is doubling its cash back rewards for new account holders from 1.5% to 3% on up to $20,000 in purchases during the first year. That potentially adds up to an extra $300 in cash back.

'Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker' Trailer Marks The End Of An Era,www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/04/12/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-trailer-disney-jj-abrams-daisy-ridley-carrie-fisher-box-office/,"'Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker' Walt Disney Well, the title of the next Star Wars movie is The Rise of Skywalker , and it now has a trailer. The tease and title drop comes just after Disney’s big “Here’s what Disney+ will have” presentation yesterday. And yeah, at just $6.99 per month (or $70 for the whole year), the Mouse House isn’t messing around in terms of challenging Netflix and Amazon Prime. Also of note, we got word yesterday that The Mandalorian (created by Jon Favreau and starring Pedro Pascal) will be available at launch time, along with a new season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars and the other Star Wars movies. So, in that sense, this ninth “episode” is somewhat bittersweet.
It is the final chapter in the Skywalker/Solo saga. It is also the final chapter in the sagas of Rey, Finn, Poe and Kylo. Moreover, it is probably is the last time that a major theatrical Star Wars movie will be this big of an event. The Rise of Skywalker represents the last time that a Star Wars movie will be the only place to get top-tier Star Wars adventure in the live-action format. This isn’t Return of the Jedi , which ended the original trilogy or Revenge of the Sith , which closed the book on the once entirely theoretical prequel trilogy. This is merely the last Star Wars movie before the next batch of Star Wars movies.
There will surely be other Star Wars movies, be they the alleged Rian Johnson trilogy or the new trilogy crafted by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss or whatever else we get. But from here on out, we know full well that there will be regular Star Wars movies and TV shows for as long as Disney needs theatrical and streaming content. Disney will indeed slow down in terms of theatrical releases, but that we’ll be getting (allegedly) high-quality Star Wars adventure via live-action TV will automatically make the movies less unique. Sans a direct connection to the George Lucas saga, these new Star Wars projects will merely be sci-fi action shows or movies with the words “ Star Wars ” stamped on.
Moreover, presuming The Mandalorian or the planned Rogue One prequel series (co-starring Diego Luna and Alan Tudyk) feature comparatively theatrical production values, and with the likes of Taika Waititi, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rick Famuyiwa, Deborah Chow and Dave Filoni set to direct episodes of Favreau’s Pedro Pascal-starring show that’s entirely possible, then Star Wars will further become less of an event and less of a pop culture touchstone. That’s more of an issue for the theatrical films, as we all know how “unknown” sci-fi action spectaculars have fared of late. The mere notion of Star Wars TV shows and the new Star Wars movies presumably being available pretty quickly on Disney+ may make those theatrical inherently less special overall.
But even if Disney does use their streaming service to actually extend the theatrical window (which isn’t outside the realm of possibility, since the subscribers will be there whether the movie drops four months or six months after theaters), these post- Episode IX movies will exist in a world where Star Wars is just another huge franchise. Existing as they will in a time where Star Wars TV shows are about as good as Star Wars movies and in an environment where the films are merely connected to the core saga by name, will these post-Skywalker/Solo Star Wars films have anywhere near the impact of the last three direct sequels to Return of the Jedi ?
Probably not, which is why this ninth “episode” does feel like a real finale of sorts. Unlike in 1983 and 2005, we know for sure that Star Wars will continue. But that guarantee arguably makes this new installment that much more of an event. For the last time in forever, Star Wars will be special and a god among insects. J.J. Abrams’ Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker will open December 20, 2019. It looks great, it will hopefully be good and either way, it marks the end of an era. From now on, Star Wars will be just another piece of IP, a giant among giants, intended to entice folks to pay $7 a month for Disney+.

Council Post: Nine UI Design Aspects Crucial To Attracting And Keeping Customers,www.forbes.com,"Editors, Forbes Technology Council",04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/04/12/nine-ui-design-aspects-crucial-to-attracting-and-keeping-customers/,"Getty Every interaction your company has with a client or customer is a chance to show them about what you do and why it matters. This doesn't apply only to in-person interactions, however: Your company website or program are common — and sometimes the primary or only — touch point someone has with your company.
This means that how easy it is to navigate your site or app can matter tremendously. Can people find the information they need quickly? How difficult is it for them to figure out how to take the next step, be that creating an account, signing up for additional resources or performing a routine task within your program?
To help highlight areas to watch, members of the Forbes Technology Council , below, discuss some of the aspects of UI design that are crucial for long-term success. Here's what they said:
1. Consistency
Consistency is one of the key aspects of UI design. Consistency in the color choice, consistency in the layout, consistency in the flow and everything else — all of these create overall familiarity with your product, which leads to comfort and connection between the user and the product. - Tigran Sloyan, CodeSignal
2. Looks And Ease Of Use
With the advent of powerful consumer and business mobile apps, employees now expect a similar experience from the software they use as part of their daily lives at work. Complex, ugly UIs no longer work for the demanding requirements of today's workers. A straightforward, attractive and easy-to-use UI has become critical for software developers looking to sell to forward-thinking organizations. - Alan Rich, Chrome River Technologies
Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify? 3. Ease Of Workflow And Scalability
UI design varies in many aspects, yet when it all comes down to proper workflow. Any platform supported should contribute to this as well as allow scalability for continuity and growth. This can be applied to both ends, developer and user experience. - Mark Ruber, Las Vegas Paiute Tribe
4. Customer Persona Targeting
We believe UI design is about finding different ways of reaching a destination: catching attention, gaining loyalty and leaving a lasting impression. We focus on thinking broad and going deep, and one aspect of UI design that is crucial is the understanding of — and designing for — customer personas. That can help to target, personalize and deliver an individualized experience. - Ashish Goyal, Srijan
5. Calm, Intuitive Flow
UI is like Impressionism. It should provide a calm intuitive suggested flow and engagement path. Imagine famous impressionist painters, like Claude Monet. His art wasn't burdened with detail or photorealism, yet conveys both time, place and emotion. We need more of that. - Andrzej Kawalec, Optiv Inc

Reduce the number of clicks to achieve objectives. The more times a user has to click the less likely they are to finish whatever your conversion is and the more likely they are to leave your site. - Chris M. Walker, Legiit Online Marketplace
7. A Focus On User-Expected Outcomes
UI design is considered successful when the focus is on the desired outcomes expected by the user when they interact. UI design is also successful when it makes the user feel smart and feels tailored uniquely to that user at that usage instance. - Shailu Tipparaju, Examity
8. Reduced Complexity
Great UI design should take the complexity out of crucial tasks required for the end user and essentially deliver a great user experience. It is crucial as it's one of the key decision factors in a user’s successful interaction and perpetual enjoyment or dissatisfaction with a product or service. As it relates to software as a service, it can have a huge impact on the adoption of the technology. - Abakar Saidov, Beamery
9. Starting With The End User In Mind
Differentiate between user experience design and UI visual design. Are you trying to design the right experience for the user of your product? Or are you looking to make the skin look appealing? In either case, start with the end user in mind and work backward from their preferences. - Guru Hariharan, CommerceIQ Inc"

Rugby Australia Has Shown Leadership By Firing Israel Folau Over Homophobic Meme,www.forbes.com,Mike Meehall Wood,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikemeehallwood/2019/04/12/rugby-australia-has-shown-leadership-by-firing-israel-folau-over-homophobic-meme/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. SportsMoney I write about sports, politics, money and the points where they meet. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin Australia's Israel Folau smiles as he crosses for a try during the rugby union international between England and Australia at Twickenham in London, Saturday, Nov. 24, 2018. (AP Photo/Tim Ireland) ASSOCIATED PRESS The furore that has consumed Australian sports in the last few days might seem a little parochial to American or European readers, but the ramifications of it speak to a much wider issue regarding the expectations that we have for our sports stars and the governing bodies that organize our leagues.
For those who have missed it, a brief summary. Israel Folau, a star rugby union player, has been threatened with dismissal from his contract with Rugby Australia (RA), the governing body in charge of the sport, after posting homophobic memes on social media. Folau, a devout Christian, had been warned a year ago about posting anti-LGBTIQ content and had signed a new contract with Rugby Australia which is thought to contain a clause that specifically prohibits him from expressing such beliefs. Since the memes were posted, Rugby Australia has said that they will fire him should he be unable to provide “compelling mitigating factors” for his behavior.
Initially, Folau went to ground and was unreachable by his employers, but recently resurfaced and met with Rugby Australia, who control the Australian Wallabies national team, and New South Wales Rugby Union (NSWRU), who control his club, the NSW Waratahs. The parties met in Sydney on Friday and reports from the meeting from RA and NSWRU stated that their position was “unchanged”, in that unless Folau sufficiently explained himself, he would be fired. Those are the facts of the case as they stand at the time of writing. All the rest is bluster, but bluster that tells us plenty about how we see our sports stars and governing bodies.
Let’s take a tour of the dramatis personae. Folau is a man of strong faith, a faith that he clearly takes to include the anti-gay standpoints that he has repeatedly expressed. It is his right as a citizen to hold those views, regardless of how unpopular they might be and how much offense they might cause. He is of Tongan heritage and a proud member of Australia’s Polynesian community, a group for whom religion is often central to family life. In 2017, Folau wrote an article for the Player’s Voice in which he wrote of the “three Fs” of Polynesian families: faith, family and finances. For a lot of Polynesian boys in Sydney, that third F is inextricably linked to a fourth: Footy.
Lucky then, that Folau is also a supremely talented athlete: he began in the National Rugby League (NRL), the premier competition in Australia’s dominant rugby code, rugby league, where he was 2007 Rookie of the Year and became the youngest man ever to represent Australia at just 18. He transitioned to AFL football with the Greater Western Sydney Giants and then again to rugby union, where he is the franchise player for the NSW Waratahs and a standout for the national team. That might not mean much to non-Australians, but imagine a number one draft pick in the NBA winning Rookie of the Year, giving it up to play Major League Baseball and then going on to play quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. Israel Folau is that good.
Which makes him difficult to fire, obviously. That Rugby Australia has threatened to fire him, and seem likely to carry out that threat, is a huge call. Their position on Folau has to be seen in the context of the current situation within Australian sport and Australian society in general. From a purely sporting perspective, this is a crucial period for Aussie rugby union: there is a World Cup in September and Australia will likely enter it at their lowest ever international ranking. 2018 was one of their worst years on record, losing seven of their thirteen matches. They need their best players and Folau is certainly one of those. On a club level, Australian clubs lag behind their counterparts from New Zealand and South Africa - with whom they compete in the Super Rugby championship - and again, they need their stars.

Off the field, things aren’t much better. Domestic rugby union has now been almost completely superseded in Australia by the NRL and the AFL, while viewing figures have even fallen lower than the A-League, the major soccer competition, which only began play in 2005. It is a sorry state of affairs for Rugby Australia. The international game has always been more important to administrators than club rugby union, but even that is currently in a state of flux. World Rugby, the international governing body of the sport, has been debating beginning an international competition, the Nations Championship, which they hope will boost revenues and TV viewership, but has been criticized for excluding Pacific Island nations. Rugby Australia needs the money and the eyeballs but is conscious that the Nations Championship might diminish their domestic game yet further. The potential exclusion of Tonga, Samoa and Fiji from the Nations Championship caused a huge backlash among players and fans alike.
The Polynesian aspect of Folau’s story ties back into this. Rugby union in Australia is traditionally very white and very middle class, concentrated around the elite private schools of Sydney. The discord between what the fans and administrators look like and what the players look like is striking. It is estimated that a third of all professional rugby players worldwide are of Pacific Islander descent, whether Polynesian (heritage in Samoa, Tonga or New Zealand Maori) or Melanesian (Fijian or Papua New Guinean), an astounding number given the relatively small number of people in that part of the world. Increasingly, Rugby Australia’s players hail from the heartlands of rugby league, the huge expanses of Greater Western Sydney that are home to the majority of Australia’s Pacific Islander community and who provide almost half of the players to the NRL. Folau is the most prominent of these, a league convert turned to union and the most famous Polynesian in Australia.
In threatening to fire Folau, Rugby Australia are reflecting the general mood within Australia regarding gay rights. The country legalized same-sex marriage in 2017 after a two-thirds of the public backed it in a vote - Israel Folau was a prominent voice against it. The Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, himself a Pentecostalist like Folau, condemned the player’s comments, as did Bill Shorten, the leader of the opposition Labour Party. From face-value a PR perspective, there was only one option for Rugby Australia, and that would always likely trump any benefit Folau brings on the field.
Internally, it might have been a more difficult decision. Not only are they depriving themselves of their best player in a World Cup year they also risk isolating their most prominent Polynesian star in a sport filled with Polynesian players at a time when the governing body’s stock among Polynesians has never been lower. Homosexuality is still illegal in Tonga and Samoa and, while Folau’s views are by no means shared by all Polynesians, there is a significant minority who see them as part of their cultural heritage. Billy Vunipola, an England international of Tongan descent, posted a message in support of Folau, which was liked by a host of other players and earned himself a disciplinary meeting with the Rugby Football Union, Rugby Australia’s English counterpart. Other members of the Polynesian community condemned Folau, with New Zealand All Blacks star Nehe Milner-Skudder writing: “What I find disappointing is that an influential Pacific Island brother with a massive following, lots of people look up to him and to see a post like that which spreads hate, rejection, a message of intolerance and difference...Lot of people will be affected by it, especially our Pacific youth, and that's not what they need to be hearing.”
Through their actions, Rugby Australia has dramatically shifted the opprobrium from themselves and their sport onto one individual and his beliefs. Whether or not there is more endemic homophobia in rugby goes undiscussed, because the public ire is concentrated on Israel Folau. The rugby league authorities also quickly got a statement out that nixed any ideas of his switching back to the NRL. Now it seems most likely that Folau will end up abroad, playing club rugby union in France or Japan, earning a good wage but exiled from the national team.
Rugby Australia’s conduct has been swift and decisive. They gave Folau a warning, he did not heed it, and he will likely pay the price. At the very least, he is in breach of contract if, as suggested, Rugby Australia included a clause in his deal regarding social media posts. They can hang him out to dry and make a big play of their values to the rest of the nation. They have shown social leadership - if at considerable sporting cost.

Why Subscription Boxes Are Here to Stay,www.forbes.com,Greg Petro,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregpetro/2019/04/12/why-subscription-boxes-are-here-to-stay/,"Nearly a decade after the first subscription box services hit the doorsteps of consumers, retailers are still working to get their heads around the significance of the industry’s rapid growth. It seems there is very little we cannot have delivered to our doors in a surprise-like box, as the industry has ballooned well beyond clothing and razors to delivering everything from dog treats to toys, plants, and even crystals, directly to consumers. According to a recent Fast Company article, there were 3,500 subscription box services as of October of last year, an increase of 40% from the year before.
While subscription boxes are still a small slice of the overall retail industry, a growing number of consumers are planning to test drive a few. First Insight’s recent survey on subscription boxes, which was featured in USA Today , showed that 25% of respondents (both men and women combined) are currently receiving a subscription box, and another 32% of respondents plan to subscribe in the next six months.
And it’s not just the hipsters getting on board. While millennials unsurprisingly lead the way (31% currently subscribed and another 38% planning to in the next six months), even baby boomers are signing up. Although only 8% of baby boomers currently subscribe, 22% plan to do so in the next six months.
Traditional retailers are not turning a blind eye to the subscription box phenomenon, as Target ( TGT ) and Walmart ( WMT ) have started “Beauty Box” subscription box services. Amazon ( AMZN ) , no stranger to direct-to-consumer models, has no less than 18 subscription boxes available.
The success of the subscription box model speaks to the profound effect the direct-to-consumer model is having on the retail industry. As consumers move toward expectations that retailers will get it right the first time, their attention spans have shortened for retailers unable to align their offerings with personalized preferences out of the gate.
Here are three reasons subscription models are so effective:
More is Less
I came across an interesting article that discussed the book, “The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less,” which states that the more choices consumers have, the harder it is for them to decide, and in turn, the less likely they are to buy. Moreover, consumers are more prone to feel buyer’s remorse after choosing among a plethora of options.
In a world of overwhelming choice, consumers can get stuck when it comes to selecting the items they want. Subscription boxes are the perfect solution to indecisiveness and regret as they curate products according to a customer’s personal preferences, simplifying the process, and letting personalization become the center of the retailer-customer relationship in a way that encourages extreme loyalty.
This also speaks to why direct-to-consumer companies like Away ( AWAY ) , Dollar Shave Club ( UL ) , Warby Parker , and Casper have had such great success. They offer a few good quality, well-priced options which a consumer can quickly tailor to their tastes and have at their door in a short time.
Other retailers are engaging in different direct-to-consumer models, as 40 percent of popular b rands already have at least one channel to directly supply to consumers. Nike ( NKE ) expects to reach $15 billion in direct-to-consumer sales by 2020. Levi’s hit a two-decade sales record as direct-to-consumer helped them increase their revenue by 22% globally in 2018, and Nespresso’s DTC platform records 250,000 purchases each month, with a 24.7% conversion rate – almost double the rate from similar purchases on Amazon according to the Future of Customer Engagement and Commerce .
Unpredictability
The motivation to buy these boxes can be partially explained through the powerful rush of dopamine that we get both when there is anticipation of a reward and when the reward is actually delivered. Consider Burrhus Skinner’s theory of operant conditioning , which found that one of the most powerful forms of positive reinforcement (getting subjects to do what you want them to do) occurs when there is a “ reward uncertainty ,” which is compared to the thrill of gambling. And according to gambling researcher Dr Charles Livingstone , “if someone is given a predictable set of rewards, they lose interest quickly. But if it is unpredictable, they tend to establish behavior which is hard to extinguish.”
Subscription boxes, while hardly a gambling addiction, still bring a predictable, yet uncertain, set of rewards. Most subscription boxes are chosen especially for that specific person based on particular needs and preferences. They’re receiving custom-picked items based on their personal preferences, offering convenience while introducing customers to new brands and trends. This article also goes on to point out that once retailers have consumers transact in a certain way (for example by signing up for ongoing subscriptions), consumers are likely to continue this behavior - even more so if the behavior is easy to perform and brings satisfaction or enjoyment.
The Experience
According to a McKinsey study , consumers want a great end-to-end experience and are willing to subscribe only where automated purchasing gives them tangible benefits, such as lower costs or increased personalization . In fact, 28% percent of those surveyed by McKinsey said that a personalized experience was the most important reason for continuing to subscribe. And consumers are quick to cancel subscription boxes that do not deliver a superior experience.
Good experiences are defined differently by every brand based on the expectations of the customers they serve or target. But one thing is consistent: the success of subscription boxes is driven by understanding every consumer’s unique needs, whether it’s taste, style preferences, size, cost or even psyche. Engaging with their consumers in real-time, gathering feedback, and adjusting offerings is the critical component that is building loyalty and long-term value for both the retailer as well as consumer.
While subscription boxes may not make sense for every retailer, the reasons they are doing well are relevant to the entire industry. Tapping into the psyche of today’s shopper, whether it’s feeling overwhelmed by too many options, or the enjoyment of being surprised, is a best practice that every retailer can embrace. Knowing your customers and anticipating their needs and preferences with the right products at the right prices is now table stakes. Retailers able to embrace these concepts will be able to keep pace with consumers, particularly as their expectations for getting it right the first time grow."

Should Race Be Considered In The Hiring Process?,www.forbes.com,Janice Gassam,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2019/04/12/should-race-be-considered-in-the-hiring-process/,"Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC) recently announced that the medical school will no longer consider race when assessing applicants. This decision aligns with the policies of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and the crusade of the current administration to limit affirmative action in education. Some have argued that the usage of race as a factor in medical school admissions decisions is discriminatory because it’s an example of reverse racism . The Trump administration has declared that institutions that discriminate against whites during the college admissions process will be penalized. Affirmative action was established in 1961 as an executive order by John F. Kennedy to “ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.” Research indicates that affirmative action is, in fact, helpful for black students and that black students who benefit from affirmative action achieve more and have higher incomes than black students who do not benefit from affirmative action. The recent news from TTUHSC brings up an important discussion about race and whether it should be used in the decision-making process. It is also important to assess whether race should be considered when analyzing job applicants.
When looking more closely at the race relations between whites and blacks in America, there are still doubts regarding whether the country has really made racial progress. A 2019 Race in America survey by the Pew Research Center revealed that 58% of Americans surveyed believe race relations in the United States are bad. 78% of blacks surveyed think that America hasn’t made much progress when it comes to equality between whites and blacks. The survey also determined that there is much skepticism among blacks regarding whether there will ever be racial equality in America.
One of the tools that was put in place to remedy these racial barriers was affirmative action. Curtailing affirmative action could actually widen the racial divide. Research indicates that the removal of affirmative action programs negatively impacts racial diversity in the workplace, with a decrease in the number of Asian women, black women, and Hispanic men. What was particularly concerning about this research is that for black women, the negative impact of affirmative action removal was exacerbated as time went on. The same study found that the number of white men in the workplace increased with the removal of affirmative action programs .
Affirmative action was created to boost opportunities for marginalized groups like people of color (POC) and women, who have historically been disadvantaged in the United States. Much of the dissension when it comes to affirmative action stems from the belief that affirmative action programs unfairly advantage people of color, putting unqualified individuals in positions they do not deserve. Research by Kimberlé Crenshaw, a law professor Columbia University, indicates that the group that has historically benefitted the most from affirmative action is actually white women. With the vast amount of research in favor of affirmative action, there is support for its usage in hiring and selection.
Affirmative action is a necessary addition to any diversity toolkit. While some argue that affirmative action is reverse racism and disadvantages white people, the research proves that the removal of affirmative action programs would diminish efforts to create an equitable workplace. If your company does not reflect your customer base, this can have a direct impact on profitability. By creating a more diverse workplace, employers can increase their competitive advantage and attract new customers. The demographics of this country are changing and the U.S. Census Bureau predicts that by 2044, more than 50% of the United States population will be non-white. An organization that is unable to attract and retain diverse professionals will not be able to survive."
How Perry Ellis' Wash And Go Tech Suit Is So Fly That Men Can Scale A Fence While Wearing It,www.forbes.com,Joseph DeAcetis,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephdeacetis/2019/04/12/how-perry-ellis-wash-and-go-tech-suit-is-so-fly-that-men-can-scale-a-fence-while-wearing-it/,"The Perry Ellis® designer fashion brand arose from Perry Ellis the man, a fresh, forward-thinking designer not mired in tradition. In fact, the brands ethos has not changed since the designer’s first unapologetic, American collection in 1976. Today, Perry Ellis is a global lifestyle brand that continues to change the industry through apparel, accessories and fragrances that adapt to work, life and play. Building on heritage while innovating to have a fresh and unexpected outlook on life, the brand creates the looks that reflect the way people want to work, play and live today. Welcome to the future and the great return of the suit.

Perry Ellis I recently had the privilege of speaking with Oscar Feldenkreis, President and CEO of Perry Ellis about the DNA of the brand, who is the Perry Ellis man and how he wanted to take performance fabrics and use them in understandable ways-using the influence of active sportswear to inspire unique versions of suiting to fit into their wardrobe.
Joseph DeAcetis: In your words, talk to Forbes about the DNA of Perry Ellis menswear- history until present?
Oscar Feldenkreis: Perry Ellis is an iconic American brand, founded by our namesake designer in 1976. When Perry first launched the brand, he wanted to make fashion fun and accessible to all. At the time, he focused on ease of wear, and being ready for every situation.
 Today, we’ve taken the foundation that he built and turned Perry Ellis into a billion dollar, global lifestyle brand. We focus on versatility in dressing, allowing guys to move from day to night to weekend and back with what we have to offer. Most of our clothes have performance or ease of care attributes included; allowing our guy to be ready for any and every situation life throws his way.
JD: Who is the Perry Ellis man?
OF: The Perry Ellis man is confident, inclusive and open to new ideas and opportunities. He is the type of guy who looks at the day and sees no limits. In his work life, he’s a go-getter, constantly improving and striving for greatness. In his personal life, he knows what he wants and seeks the best that the world has to offer. He embraces change and technology and uses these tech innovations in every facet of his life...including his clothes. He is adaptable to any situation and is able to move from occasion to occasion with ease and comfort.
JD: Talk to us about what men are seeking today in a suit and how is Perry Ellis addressing these modern day needs?
Men are seeking functionality, comfort, versatility and their look to be appropriate and pulled together-he wants to be ready for any occasion and prepared for his day.
Perry Ellis Tech Suit
Perry Ellis JD: Our readers would like to have an in-depth explanation of the Perry Ellis tech suit; talk to us about the development of the suit itself, the reasons why it came about and the advanced technology it takes to make this suit the rising star of modern men's suits.
OF:We are always seeking technical innovation in our fabric development. Stretch in both warp and weft is something usually attributed to only active wear, so we wanted to take performance fabrics and use them in understandable ways-using the influence of active sportswear to inspire unique versions of suiting to fit into their wardrobe. The fabric has other properties besides stretch: water repellency, moisture wicking and breathability. There is coolness to the fabric handle, and this immediately makes you want to put it on your body.
 The jacket details are punctuated by reflective elements under the collar, and along the sleeve buttons to protect him when commuting in traffic, on his bike. There are hidden tech pockets to protect his devices. Because it is synthetic, the fabric takes color with a rich, saturated, yet matte finish. The color bases are covered with black and navy, but we've stepped out the additions of Port, Bright Blue and Teal-clearly a celebrity favorite. These are all best selling colors for the brand.
 Best of all, the entire suit is machine washable (no need for dry cleaning). Place it in the wash, tumble-dry low, and you’re set.
JD: In your words, where should a man wear a suit?
OF: A man should wear a suit where necessary, but also to feel empowered. In a suit like this particular one, you can wear it without restriction and formality. It's the perfect answer to the new codes of the modern workforce-be prepared, be appropriate, but be relaxed and comfortable. It can be dressed up or down-it can be worn with polo or a tee shirt, but as you can see, it's appropriate for the red carpet with a white shirt and tie.
 JD: What does a suit do for a man at the office as opposed to wearing separates?
OF: There’s a sense of empowerment to a full suit. Regardless of your role within an organization, when you wear a suit, you’re ready for whatever business challenges are thrown at you that day.
 JD: What was your biggest risk in developing this suit?
OF: Developing a machine washable suit is quite difficult and we wanted to ensure that the entire piece would meet our wash testing standards, which can be rather rigorous. We’ve been working with innovative fabric and treatments for quite some time, and we were happy to find that the suit passed all testing with flying colors. As we have been working with a variety of tech-infused products, we were able to overcome any risks by applying all that we had learned to this suit.
 We have a similar fabric in a tech trouser, which fits incredibly well, looks polished yet feels like a track pant. Our total stretch button down shirt is a best seller, as well as our washable (and dryable) suit. It was more about getting our customer to try it on - to feel how it moves on the body.
JD: Talk to us about how technology is aiding in the development on menswear?
OF: Overall, technology and performance are driving newness within menswear, thereby expanding every man’s wardrobe. Guys react to hand feel, comfort, and looking appropriate for every occasion. There are numerous advancements to make the guys life easier and effortless - we do the development work for him, put the looks together, tell him how and where to wear something and generally provide the tools so he can move throughout his day with ease. All of our items are washable and have an easy-care component - even our fully constructed washable suit. The fusible, chest piece, inner construction, as well as the fabric are completely washable and machine dryable. Without technical research and advancements, this would never be possible. This tech infusion is also allowing us to reduce lead times and bring our products to market at a much faster pace.
JD: What is the greatest achievement in the development of this suit?
OF: This suit is the pinnacle example of our performance pieces married with easy care properties. Our brand positioning is Life Ready...this suit exemplifies that through the numerous attributes and allow it to fit any occasion.
JD: Who is the target audience/demographic for these product offerings?
OF: Our target audience is the millennial guy but this suit can work for men of any age. It's a very slim fit, and because of the fabric construction, it moves with the body. I encourage anyone at any age, who is athletic and likes a slim fit, to give it a try

Perry Ellis JD: If you could choose one celebrity, you' like to see wearing this suit, who would it be and why?
OF: Overall, we are a diverse and all-inclusive brand...we’ve had a number of noteworthy figures of various backgrounds wear our product over the years. This suit in particular has been worn by a vast array of celebrities. That being said, if I had to pick one guy, Ryan Reynolds would be the ideal candidate. He is active with an extremely fit body, while also being a leading man with a sense of humor. Audiences understand him and he’s really liked by all - he’s the quintessential Perry Ellis man.
JD: What is your growth strategy over the next 3 years?
OF: We will focus on a few key strategies -growth in international regions, expand the Perry Ellis product offerings through new licensed partners, and broaden our overall reach in both e-commerce and brick and mortar retailers. Lastly, we will continue to connect with our consumers through the use of digital channels and unique digital commerce."
"Can AI Save Us From Bias In The Diverse, NonBinary Workforce Of The Future?",www.forbes.com,Monica Melton,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicamelton/2019/04/12/can-ai-save-us-from-bias-in-the-diverse-nonbinary-workforce-of-the-future/,"Hiring biases have held back minority and female applicants, especially in the tech industry, where white and Asian men hold most of the jobs. Consequently, startups and big companies have attempted to tap emerging technologies like artificial intelligence to improve their recruiting processes. But those efforts are likely to get even more challenging as more applicants identify as more than one ethnicity—or as neither gender. At the Forbes CIO Summit in Half Moon Bay, California, on Monday, Laura Gómez, CEO of $10 million diversity HR software startup, Atipica, said her company’s algorithm “allows us to understand aggregate resume data, Census, Department of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) data to predict who is in the workforce.”
“There’s a lot of data gaps around diversity and inclusion,” Gómez said. “It has to be self-reporting a lot of people don’t like to self-report. We are trying to fill those gaps and make sure leaders understand where those gaps are.”
Efforts to use AI in recruiting have hit some rough spots: Last year, an in-house project by Amazon to build a tool to select the top candidates using artificial intelligence was shelved after executives realized the program was penalizing women ’s résumés. Amazon recruiters weren't able to use the tool to evaluate candidates. The reason, according to Reuters : The AI system had taught itself, based on past Amazon hiring patterns, that the most successful candidates were male.
LinkedIn, with 600 million users in its system, realized that its recruiting algorithm, which surfaces prospective candidates for recruiters, was at risk of compounding hiring bias. Last year it rolled out Representative Results, a change to its algorithm that makes sure AI doesn’t introduce bias, such as showing more male candidates in search results than the available pool of applicants.
“It would be possible to create biased systems. We wanted to make sure that that bias didn’t get out of control,” John Jersin, vice president of product, talent solutions and careers at LinkedIn, said about the company’s software. “We can use techniques to influence people to reduce bias in outcomes.""
From left: Laura Mandaro, Forbes Media; Laura Gomez, Atipica; John Jersin, LinkedIn; and Nicole Sanchez, Vaya Consulting, at the Forbes CIO Summit Forbes Media
Jersin says LinkedIn’s efforts around diversity “started with gender because it’s the easiest one to get a significant dataset on. It’s a 50/50 split just about.”
The majority of LinkedIn’s users may fit into gender binaries, but for the coming workforce this may not be the case, according to Nicole Sanchez, founder and managing partner of Vaya Consulting, which leads Fortune 500 companies in diversity and inclusion training.
“Fifty percent of those who identify as Gen-Z living on the coasts thought about their gender and identify somewhere on a nonbinary spectrum of gender. As much as we want to drive for something simple like gender, for the next set of workers, gender is decreasingly meaningful,” said Sanchez.
Recruiting for the existing workforce rather than the one that is coming can cause hiring professionals to reinforce biases, perpetuating a flawed system.
Although 21% of computer science degree earners are Black or Latinx, they make up just 10% of technical employees in the tech workforce, according to a 2018 study from the Kapor Center .
“What’s happening is folks are using LinkedIn, looking at a picture and guessing,” Sanchez said. “There are laws that say you can’t ask someone their race and gender on the way in, but the proxy we’re currently using solidifies our old broken system of looking at each other and assuming. Increasingly, I’m going to be wrong as Gen-Z comes into the workforce.”
As much as humans have baked their own bias into AI and machine-learning models, yet another challenge is that these systems are only as good as the data they’re based on. Sanchez isn’t convinced that technology can wholly solve hiring biases.
“In the next decade, we’re going to be a country with a majority of people of color, and our systems are not ready for it,” said Sanchez. “As much as we want to nail down data, because we’re about data-driven solutions, our data’s wrong. Some of the work that we have to do has to be shepherded in by humans.”"
6 Tips For Successful Cause Marketing Campaigns,www.forbes.com,Kate Harrison,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateharrison/2019/04/12/6-tips-for-successful-cause-marketing-campaigns/,"April is Earth Month and with Spring comes a host of businesses looking to launch cause-based marketing campaigns . But what sets the best campaigns apart from the underperformers? John Marcinuk, Head of Marketing for Blue Fountain Media , shared his top tips for making the most of the moment with your cause based campaign. Finding the Right Cause is Key “Find the right cause to market, paying special attention to make sure that it aligns with your business goals,” Marcinuk suggests. “You don’t want to end up with a mismatched campaign, as when Kentucky Fried Chicken tried partnering with Komen for the Cure with pink buckets of fried chicken breasts. The health messaging was clearly off!” For Earth Month, you want something eco-focused, but if it is not a natural fit, don’t greenwash.
Be Genuine “Be sure your involvement accentuates your larger social role as a company and focuses on the genuine impact your campaign will have for the cause,” Marcinuk explains. You need to be more than a funds provider. “Be seen as a business that’s fostering real change with a boots on the ground approach — and be shown actively deploying that action in support of the cause.”
Look For Celebrity Allies There are a lot of celebrities, such as Matt Damon, Jessica Alba and Adrian Grenier, who have put environmental justice and green living at the center of their personal brands. In fact, a quick Google search for “ environmental celebrity ” yields a robust list! “Consider approaching a celebrity or influencer who is invested in and passionate about the same cause as your campaign is considering,” Marcinuk urges. “They’ll have the ability to raise awareness about your cause and entice followers to engage with your campaign. It’s one thing to say we’re bringing Hamilton to Puerto Rico; but it’s far more engaging to have the star Lin-Manuel Miranda explaining what this production meant for him and his family's hometown, on a most personal level.”
Be Creative “With so many screens vying for your audience’s attention, your campaign needs to grab their eyes using all means necessary,” Marcinuk notes. “Too many non-profits take a conservative marketing approach that can’t break through the static. The right combination of captivating imagery, heartfelt storytelling, creative presentation, and playful wit is what it takes to entice an audience to embrace your cause and be motivated to take action to support it.”
Use A Multi-channel Approach “Extend the reach of your message,” Marcinuk says. “For example, we began the Lin-Manuel Miranda campaign with the hashtag #Ham4PR; we promoted the cause using a launch email; our group blanketed social media and produced a video for use on Instagram and Facebook, added social media advertising; we alerted the press; and we created a series of reveals throughout the campaign to extend interest across all these channels.
Timing Is Everything You need to strategically launch your campaign at the right time so that you and your team will have the energy to sustain engagement throughout the length of its duration. “For our Hamilton campaign, we focused on it being the right time for Arts to return to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. We demonstrated how bringing the show to the island would provide assistance to both the community and the arts there. In terms of keeping interest high, we kept expanding the number of winners who would be flown to Puerto Rico to see the show through a series of timed reveals. …. The lucky winners went from just one to eventually 50 entrants. This kept initial contributors engaged, while encouraging new people to make donations.”
If you have a green product or promotion, following the tips above to help spread the word will take your message a further. Remember: when you succeed in an altruistic effort, your help makes a difference!"
You Probably Shouldn't Copy Jack Dorsey's 'Wellness' Habits,www.forbes.com,msn.com,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajdellinger/2019/04/12/you-probably-shouldnt-copy-jack-dorseys-wellness-habits/,"Earlier this week, Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey shared some of his ""wellness"" habits to CNBC . Some of his recommendations are actionable and achievable for most people, like taking time to meditate or journaling to keep track of important events that happen each day. Some of Dorsey's routine would be great for most people, but not particularly practical, like working at a standing desk or sitting in a sauna every day. And then there are his dietary habits. Dorsey revealed in the interview that he limits himself to one meal per weekday — typically a pretty light offering that consists of ""fish, chicken, or steak with a salad, spinach, asparagus or Brussels sprouts"" with a dessert of ""mixed berries or some dark chocolate"" paired with a glass of red wine. During the weekend, Dorsey forgoes food altogether. After dinner Thursday, he skips meals on Friday, Saturday and most of Sunday before opting to eat dinner again Sunday evening.
What Dorsey is taking part in are forms of fasting. He's doing intermittent fasting during the week and periodic fasts during the weekend. However, given his caloric intake when he does eat—the Washington Post theorized its as little as 1,000 calories per meal—it's safe to say his practices are all on the extreme side. It's possible that Dorsey's routines may well work for him and could be monitored and guided by a medical professional. But these eating habits are not a viable option for most people and definitely aren't the "" biohacks "" they were presented as.
There is some evidence to suggest there are health benefits associated with intermittent fasting, including boosting energy and losing weight. Mark Mattson, a professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, has suggested the practice can also help stave off neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.
However, it's hard to say just how beneficial fasting is. The science is still out on how it affects people, and many of the positive associations with the practice come from studies performed on animals, according to Patricia Bannan , MS, RDN, a professional nutritionist and healthy cooking expert. ""While there are some studies on intermittent fasting in humans that have shown beneficial results, more studies need to be conducted in humans, which can be complicated to perform,"" she said.
When intermittent fasting does work, it's typically done in a much more limited fashion than what Dorsey practices. One popular method is called the "" 5:2 diet ,"" which encourages people to spend five days eating a normal, healthy diet while limiting intake to under 500 calories for two, non-consecutive days during the week. Even these types of fasting diets can prove unsustainable for many people. A 2017 study comparing fasting to a more standard form of dieting. It found 25 percent of people in the fasting group dropped out compared to just 10 percent in the regular diet group.
There is even less evidence to suggest fasting in a manner like Dorsey does will produce healthy outcomes, and one would be hard pressed to find a nutritionist or dietitian who would recommend it. Alissa Rumsey, MS, RD, owner of Alissa Rumsey Nutrition and Wellness , said that she wouldn't advise people try to replicate Dorsey's extreme form of fasting.
""Food provides energy, something that we need throughout the course of a day - so eating just once per day, and fasting for several days in a row, is not something I recommend,"" she said. Rumsey noted that research on intermittent fasting is mixed and it's best for people to find a diet that they can stick to. ""Diets like this are based upon external factors, rather than listening to your own internal body cues.""
While Dorsey claims some positive outcomes from his fasts including improved focus and better sleep, his description of his experiences while fasting are troubling. He said the first time he went without food for three days, he felt like he was hallucinating. ""Hallucinating after not eating is not a good thing, Rumsey said. ""It's a sign that your body needs energy and nutrients.""
As for some of the claimed health benefits, experts have their doubts about that, too. ""Research actually shows the opposite [regarding the ability to focus]—that eating balanced meals throughout the day is what helps to boost concentration, focus and work performance,"" Rumsey said. There is also evidence to suggest that fasting can cause disruptions to the sleep cycle , which can cause other negative health outcomes.
There's nothing wrong with trying to find a dietary option that works for you, especially if you are guided by an expert. Sustainability and overall health are key. If you're hoping to find success by copying the dubious and even troubling practices of a multi-millionaire and his ""biohacks,"" you may want to reconsider that plan. ""Extreme fasting like this carries a lot of risks and is not something I recommend,"" Rumsey said."
Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Launches $6.9M Endeavor To Increase Diversity Of College STEM Students,www.forbes.com,Brittany Chambers,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brittanychambers/2019/04/12/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-launches-6-9m-endeavor-to-increase-diversity-of-college-stem-students/,"“Every student — not just a lucky few — are worthy of an education that allows them to reach their full potential,” Priscilla Chan of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) shared at the 2019 ASU-GSV Summit . During the education and technology-based conference, the co-founder and co-CEO delivered a captivating keynote exploring the profound role we each can play in globally impacting the lives of current and future learners. Especially, as Chan noted, similar to the science field, the stakes for education are “impossibly high” and demand a system that explores the world we live in and the complexity of the lives of each unique student. CZI’s work has served as an extension of this vision aiming to contribute to the development of a system that ensures that, similar to the science field, every advancement from smallest to most profound in theory make it to practice.
Following this moving message, Chan embodied this vision with an announcement, at the University of California (UC) San Diego, of a partnership geared to award $6.9 million in grants to increase the diversity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students on college campuses. The grant will use elements of a successful University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) program called the Meyerhoff Scholars Program to support underrepresented students pursuing careers in STEM. The expansion of this program will roll out on two University of California campuses: UC San Diego and UC Berkeley.
Priscilla Chan with UC San Diego PATHS Scholar students at the announcement of $6.9 million in grants that will boost opportunities for underserved populations in STEM education; including future PATHS Scholars from UC San Diego.
Erik Jepsen, UC San Diego Publications The Meyerhoff program was selected due to its recognition as one of the most effective models for supporting students pursuing careers in STEM, across the country. To date, the program has facilitated opportunities for participants to earn 300 Ph.D. degrees, 130 M.D. degrees, 54 M.D./Ph.D. degrees, 253 master’s degrees, and counting. At UMBC, this program model has been credited with graduating more African-American students who go on to earn dual M.D./Ph.D. degrees than any college in the U.S.
Pew Research Center CZI’s desire to extend this program model’s impact comes from the initiative’s recognition of data illuminating significant gaps in STEM employment in the U.S. In less than 30 years, the number of STEM workers has grown from 9.7 million to 17.3 million people by 79 percent, however, African-American and Latinx workers are still wildly underrepresented. The workforce with these populations includes White (69 percent), Asian (13 percent), African-American (9 percent), and Latinx (7 percent) workers, according to research CZI Quote: d that was conducted by the Pew Research Center . Coupled with the lack of representation, those in the STEM field who are of African-American and Latinx descent generally make less than those who are White or Asian.
In a press release on the endeavor, geared rewrite this narrative, Chan expressed that: “The key to accelerating discoveries in science or the next tech breakthrough will be dependent on our ability to bring fresh perspectives to STEM fields.” She further said that: “California’s openness to new ways of thinking is what has made this state an innovation engine for the world.” And with UC Berkeley and UC San Diego serving as major sources of talent for Silicon Valley, the schools are a great selection for the endeavor.
Overall, the University of California system is one of the largest and most diverse public research systems in the country, serving one of the largest undergraduate and graduate populations of low-income students. Further, more than 50 percent of UC undergraduates surpass their parents’ income within five years of graduating. Chan expressed that her hope is that this grant will increase those opportunities to “help bring even more diversity of perspective and experience to our state — and to Silicon Valley.”

Brittany Chambers, Photographer To level the playing field for underrepresented populations, the UMBC’s Meyerhoff program model recruits and retains underrepresented students through: outreach to high-achieving high school students, promoting collaborative team learning, curating research opportunities, fostering peer-to-peer counseling, offering preparation prior to matriculation, facilitating advisement, and engaging with students’ families. Michael Summers, Robert E. Meyerhoff Chair for Excellence in Research and Mentoring and Distinguished University Professor at UMBC, shared in the press release that: “Over three decades, UMBC has developed highly effective strategies to support student success and increase diversity in STEM fields.”
As part of the new initiative, which is an extension of the existing Meyerhoff program model’s goal, UC Berkeley aims to name the program the STEM Scholars Program. UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ illuminated that: “The STEM Scholars Program at Berkeley goes hand in hand with our commitment to a more diverse and inclusive culture across our campus, and thanks to the support of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, we are charting a clear path forward in the STEM fields.” The program is projected over the next five years to serve 100 to 120 students.
Priscilla Chan greets PATHS Scholar students of UC San Diego at the announcement of $6.9 million in grants to boost opportunities for underserved populations in STEM education.
Erik Jepsen, UC San Diego Publications At UC San Diego, this collaboration similarly aims to enhance the school’s existing PATHS Scholars Program with financial support and mentorship for under-resourced undergraduate STEM students. The program was created in 2017 by Professor Gentry Patrick, who desired to increase access to quality education in South Central Los Angeles due to challenges he experienced growing up. In rallying support around this endeavor, UC San Diego Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla expressed that: “UC San Diego’s new partnership with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is a welcomed addition to our existing efforts to increase the recruitment and retention of underrepresented students.”
To measure UC Berkeley’s STEM Scholars and UC San Diego’s PATHS STEM scholarship programs over the five-year duration of the grant, CZI proposes that qualitative and quantitative data will be used to look at engagement and career-path development during and beyond students’ tenure in the programs.
In closing, in dialogue with Chan, the CZI co-founder and co-CEO said that: “One thing that has served as a North Star for me with my two girls has been to ensure that they have opportunities in an educational environment where their voices are heard and their contributions are valued as important. I also want that for all learners.” Her vision for increasing these opportunities now extends one breath further to give voice to generations of once underserved STEM students at UC San Diego, UC Berkeley, and beyond.

Anderson .Paak's 'Ventura' Album: What's Old Is New Again,www.forbes.com,Chris Malone,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cmalone/2019/04/12/anderson-paaks-ventura-album-whats-old-is-new-again/,"Anderson .Paak loves California. Each of his albums have been named after different Southern California cities, and he often teams up with other Cali-grown artists (case in point: last year's Oxnard , named after his hometown, was executive produced by Dr. Dre). Ventura , his new LP released today via Dre's Aftermath label, acts as Oxnard 's dreamier, sonically mature older sibling, and sees the ever-versatile Paak return to many of the slinkier grooves that first put him on the map. While Oxnard 's tracklist was stacked with big-name features, Paak focuses on quality rather than quantity on Ventura , slimming down the list of guest appearances to a handful spread over 11 tracks. Rolling Stone likens Oxnard and Ventura to OutKast's 2003 double album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below , with Ventura embodying the hip hop-infused R&B spirit of The Love Below . It's an apt comparison, especially considering André 3000—the architect of The Love Below —opens Ventura with a classically punny verse on ""Come Here.""
Much of Ventura 's lyrical content is centered around Paak and different romantic situations he's found himself in, and how he's come to face things in his life in a more emotionally mature way. On the previously-released ""Make It Better,"" for example, Paak is accompanied by Motown icon Smokey Robinson while pleading a lost lover to come back, while on ""Chosen One"" he links up with frequent collaborator Sonyae Elise to longingly ask for a companion.
Oftentimes, R&B innovators either create their own sounds that draw loose inspiration from the genre, or directly emulate the classic R&B sound. Paak accomplishes both these feats to a satisfying extent on Ventura , simultaneously paying homage to (and teaming up with) pioneers in the genre while bringing the hip hop and funk elements that got him to where he is now. The saccharine ""Jet Black,"" for example, is brought to life by the vocal stylings of Brandy , while the two-part upbeat track ""Reachin' 2 Much"" acts as the 2019 to ""Jet Black""'s 1999. Another refreshing neo-R&B bop, ""King James,"" celebrates blackness in all of its forms as Paak shouts out the unofficial king of the NBA.
While Ventura may musically represent a return to form of sorts for Paak, it feels like anything but: by melding emotionally heavier material with the soul-driven sounds of his earlier career, Paak has crafted another well-rounded entry in his discography, and shows that he'll never be dictated by hip hop's conventions."

A $6.99 monthly streaming subscription rate is game changing (and a dagger to Netflix’s just announced price increase to $13/month). Bringing the libraries of Disney, Walt Disney Studios, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Fox, BlueSky and Searchlight all under one roof, exclusively, is mind blowing for both our children and the child within every one of us. With Disney+, the only place now to see Captain Marvel and the new Avengers: Endgame this Fall, as well as Frozen 2 next summer, will be Disney+. Marvel will have four different live-action series featuring Scarlet Witch and Vision, Loki, Bucky Barnes (the Winter Soldier), Sam Wilson (Falcon) and Hawkeye. Pixar will produce a number of shorts for the subscription service, featuring characters like Forky and Bo Peep from the Toy Story films. It will also have a series based in the world of Monster’s Inc. called Monsters at Work . All 30 seasons of The Simpsons will be available on day one, along with nearly all the Star Wars movies. Speaking of Star Wars , a new live-action series called The Mandalorian , set in the Star Wars universe and created by Jon Favreau ( Iron Man ), will cost an estimated $100 million to make and is already be compared to a small series Game of Thrones.
In addition, at launch, Disney+ will include 7,500 episodes of current and off-air TV shows (welcome back Hannah Montana and High School Musical ); 25 original series and 10 original movies and specials; 400 library movie titles; and 100 recent theatrical films release, according to Agnes Chu, senior VP of content, Disney+. The possibility of bundling Disney+ with Hulu and ESPN+ is on the table at launch, forcing the question of, “Do I need basic cable anymore?” Take that Oprah, Reese and Apple!!
On Thursday, at Investor Day when Bob Iger proclaimed: “Today’s presentation will show you where we’re going, but also remind you that we are starting from a position of strength and optimism.” That could have been one of the great understatements of the year…in a year full of hubris and hyperbole!
When you look at this Disney transformation, especially one that is so digitally centered, in order to drive future growth, they must:
1. Create a new North Star for Disney+ everyone can align around
2. Leverage existing assets and operating systems and quickly build/acquire what is required to succeed
3. Understand and continuously look to meet and disrupt every part of the user experience
4. Continue to innovate content/programming, the experience and overall quality every single day
5. Test, learn, fail fast and then scale (which Disney has done since 2015 in the U.K.)
6. Equip the team to win and the culture to thrive given this new environment
Interestingly, these last three may be the most challenging for Disney as they are infamous at taking unapologetic delays in launching new attractions, new theatrical releases and new offerings until they live up to their own standards (think Star Wars and Pixar delays). In the fast-paced world of streaming, a significant pivot will have to take place at Disney+ to meet consumers where they are at today, relative to how Netflix has conditioned us all. In addition, Disney’s brand stands for “creating magical moments” and the need to go big, bold and seamless on day one needs to be, in short, perfect and magical.
That being said, a new streaming service targeting families, superhero fanatics and kids is set up for success almost immediately. Personally, for the Davis household, Prime is out, network and basic cable will be next (following my kid’s leads) and the countdown to Loki getting his own series is on. With Disney+, Disney has only added to its reputation as one of the most relevant brands on the planet, once again!"
Reset. Focus. Understand. The Art of Influential Listening®,www.forbes.com,Kate Delaney,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesmarketplace/2019/04/12/reset-focus-understand-the-art-of-influential-listening/,"Interviewing 16,000 people and counting, I’ve learned a lot, including to be quiet and listen. Early on in my career, I had a brief conversation with the iconic Larry King who said to toss out the questions and let the interview unfold. Why? To listen to what’s being said and respond as the conversation moves along. In my book, Deal Your Own Destiny, there is a Chapter on what I call the Art of Influential Listening®. Without a doubt, I’ve found that one of the biggest impediments to closing deals and stronger relationships with clients is listening to the other person.
Can you really listen? I mean, really listen. It’s so much tougher than most people think. We live in an era where the average human attention span is shorter than that of a goldfish according to Timothy Eagan, a journalist and op-ed columnist for the New York Times. Couple that with the realization that people have between thirty-five and forty-eight thoughts per minute. But wait I’m not done yet. Throw in the research reported in the Harvard Business Review that most people only hear about 25 percent of what’s being said.
The statistics are piling up against us. Here are some solutions, that I talk about in more depth in my book. Being an influential listener comes down to four main points.
Taking the time to reset Setting up specific time to focus on one task (or person) at a time Listening to understand, not reply Being present and focused The only way one can listen to understand is by being present and focused on the conversation. It’s not the easiest mindset to get into, but if you follow the first three points of influential listening you have a better chance. Reset. Focus. Understand.

There Are Tech Companies And Then There Are Uber-Tech Companies...,www.forbes.com,Enrique Dans,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/enriquedans/2019/04/12/there-are-tech-companies-and-then-there-are-uber-tech-companies/,"Uber’s cofounder, Travis Kalanick , has cast a long shadow over the company , although his anything goes philosophy drove its rapid and aggressive early growth, and he will be rewarded handsomely . Nevertheless his approach created a toxic culture that included sexual harassment and spying on journalists and public employees to keep growing. That culture created real problems for the company, making it the target of lawsuits and fines, severely limiting its capacity to attract talent — as a professor, I’ve seen that happening among my MBA students for some time — until Kalanick was replaced by Dara Khosrowshahi , an experienced director and a conciliatory spirit who has taken a very different approach to running the company.
Management style and culture aside, this is a company facing major challenges: it has lost vast amounts of money from day one, much higher than another long-term loss-maker, Amazon . Uber billed $11.3 billion in 2018, but had operating losses of $3 billion, barely offset by the sales of its subsidiaries in China, Russia and Southeast Asia . Khosrowshahi says he is willing to sacrifice short-term profits in exchange for achieving long-term goals, which means continued investment in autonomous driving, essential for the future of the company: $457 million in 2018 , equivalent to several million kilometers and tens of thousands of passengers . The company says it is concerned about disputes with its drivers and is willing to share thousands of dollars among the most loyal , but these men and women have no future with Uber beyond the short term.
In its favor, the company has more than 91 million users who make an average of 5.5 trips per month, figures with significant growth potential, despite increased competition . In addition, the company’s move into food delivery and industrial transport offer good growth prospects. It is also worth pointing out its “ one share, one vote ” policy it says it wants to maintain, which contrasts sharply with other tech companies, as well as its main rival, Lyft, which give greater control to its founders.
I said some time ago I saw Uber as one of the great technology companies of the future, and its more than $100 hundred billion IPO valuation proves that. But in reality, we’re not talking here about just any old technology company, but instead a commitment to an emerging technology that will soon change the shape of our cities. This is a company leading a megatrend: transportation as service, not product. Resistance is futile ."
LNG Investment Needed As Oversupply Turns To Shortfall,www.forbes.com,Simon Flowers,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/woodmackenzie/2019/04/12/lng-investment-needed-as-oversupply-turns-to-shortfall/,"Gas is the future. Among the reasons oil companies are latching onto gas as the energy transition looms are that it’s plentiful, future demand growth outstrips oil and it has relatively low carbon intensity. Amidst all this, the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market is set to flourish. Yet prices today are collapsing. I turned to Massimo Di-Odoardo, Head of Global Gas Research, at Wood Mackenzie to make sense of what’s going on. So, Massimo, what’s triggered the price crash?
We’ve just come off the back of two strong years when surging demand growth absorbed new supply. A record 38 million tonnes, or 12%, of additional LNG supply comes on stream this year, so 2019 was always going to be difficult. Throw in a mild winter and nuclear restarts in Japan and South Korea, and it’s no surprise Europe is awash with LNG. Asian LNG prices have slumped from over U.S.$11 per million British thermal units (mm Btu) in October to US$4.5/mm Btu for May delivery. Right now, they are trading at a rare discount to European prices.
Are we at the bottom yet?
Probably not. Russian and Norwegian pipeline exports to Europe have held strong, and LNG imports to Europe are likely to increase this summer because of lower seasonal Asian demand and more supply coming on stream. A mild 2018/19 winter means storage levels in Europe are at record highs. The market is approaching a tipping point – if Russia and Norway don’t cut exports, European prices will go below US$3.5/mm Btu.
Is that below the cost of supply?
For some, yes. Cash costs for buyers of U.S. LNG into Europe are at the top of the curve, ranging from U.S.$3.50 to U.S.$4.00/mm Btu. If prices dip below that, we could see some shipments curtailed. But short-term economics aren’t the only driver. We’re going to see huge growth in U.S. volumes in coming years. Sellers want to prove to future buyers the merits of long-term U.S. LNG contracts. Shut-ins would send the wrong signal.
Will low prices boost demand?
They help. At current spot prices, gas-to-power is competitive against coal, though we’re not actually seeing much switching. In Europe, gas prices need to go below U.S.$3.5/mm Btu to displace efficient coal in Germany; whereas in Asia, lack of competition gives utilities little incentive to switch. The outlook though for LNG demand growth globally is bullish, driven by policy (such as clean air and the energy transition) and, in Europe, declining indigenous gas production. Competitive gas prices will help things along.
Are we seeing changes in LNG contract pricing?
Yes. We’ve seen Henry Hub-based contracts disrupt the market this decade because U.S. gas is cheap. But when LNG spot prices are low, Henry Hub-linked contracts are out of the money – not good. To be competitive as consumer markets open, buyers are looking for more innovative pricing. At LNG2019 in Shanghai, Tellurian Marketing announced a heads of agreement with Total, indexed to Asian LNG spot (JKM). Separately, Shell announced an agreement with Tokyo Gas, linked to coal prices – aimed squarely at LNG competing with new-build coal plants. We’ll see a lot more creative pricing as buyers and sellers struggle/fight/work/try to stay competitive.
When will prices start to recover?
Prices will double inside three years. Supply additions slow dramatically from 2021, then a yawning gap opens for new volumes post-2023. Some new projects need upward of U.S.$7/mm Btu to break even. The lead time for new LNG supply is about five years on average from final investment decision (FID) to commissioning so investors need to start building. LNG Canada (Shell), Tortue (BP) and Golden Pass (ExxonMobil/Qatar Petroleum) got the green light in the last few months. A host more FIDs are coming that will lift total investment in new projects to over U.S.$200 billion, and bring over 100 million tonnes per annum (tpa) of new LNG supply to the market by the mid-2020s.
So investors in new LNG projects should hold their nerve?
Yes, the market’s going to need the gas. The projects just need to deliver on time and on budget. The lowest-cost producers will be the winners, resilient in any market conditions."
"Star Wars Episode IX Trailer Signals Box Office Lucre, Creative Bankruptcy",www.forbes.com,Lee Seymour,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeseymour/2019/04/12/star-wars-episode-ix-trailer-signals-box-office-lucre-creative-bankruptcy/,"“We’ll always be with you. No one’s ever really gone.” Mark Hamill speaks these words over the new trailer for Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker. It’s a sweet sentiment for those of us who grew up loving the franchise, especially the original trilogy, even as it was becoming a $42 billion merchandising behemoth. The idea that the characters and creatures we loved as kids will never disappear is cozy, like a good bedtime story.
At the same time, it signals a turning point. No longer should we expect to be wowed by a galaxy far, far away – its primary purpose is now to comfort, not thrill. With the launch of Disney+ and the new Star Wars shows and films that will stream with it, The Rise of Skywalker will be, as my colleague Scott Mendelson put it , the last time a Star Wars movie feels like a special event.
And that’s already a stretch.
Under Disney’s watch, the franchise has come to resemble Obi-Wan’s assessment of Darth Vader: more machine than man. Not necessarily evil, but definitely zombie-like. It’s a rather ghoulish drip feed of nostalgia; even after their real-world analogues die, we can’t stop digging these characters up for more screen time. And while that might be great for Disney’s bank accounts, it’s a warning to those who like their Star Wars fresh – or at the very least unbeholden to misogynist, racist fanboys.
J. J. Abrams has at least been open about his desire to recreate the movies he loved as a kid. The Force Awakens was a beat-by-beat retread of A New Hope , rendering it a charming if occasionally nonsensical riff on that galaxy we know and love.
And it worked. Or rather, it sold well, which in Disney’s estimation is the same thing.
To be fair, Disney is a publicly-traded company that controls almost 1/6 th of the world’s media, and the Star Wars brand is worth more the GDP of Paraguay. Genuine risks are utterly terrifying at that scale. I struggle trying to judge whether I can wear my jeans one more time before a wash.
It is ultimately us – the fans – who have made Star Wars into what the Disney now regurgitates. They know the faithful will flock to church for the homilies we’ve already heard a hundred times. Familiarity breeds profit before it breeds contempt. (Though contempt is absolutely part of the deal – just ask Kelly Marie Tran ).
Fandom – the consumptive, performative identity of brand loyalty – impedes truly fresh content. It no longer belongs to the artist, but to the consumer. Fandom means ownership. It means love. It means safety. It means community. It means money, and compromise of quality.
Fandom means, in today's climate of franchises and spinoffs, prequels and crossovers, quite simply: too much of a dear thing.
When Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi took a lightsaber to the tropes Abrams slavishly recreated, the result was uneven but exciting. He convinced me there were still unexplored reaches in that galaxy, stories that could make up for Rogue One ’s necromantic conjurings of Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher.
Johnson gave us the most original, mature spin on the franchise since The Empire Strikes Back - and the fandom shrieked in protest. ""How dare you not give me more of what I expect? Who are you to dictate my nostalgia?""
As though they couldn’t simply watch the original films at any time, in any format, on any device.
So Disney brought back Abrams to direct Episode IX : reliable, reverent Abrams, who could never burn the sacred texts no matter how badly they need fumigating.
Cue the trailer for Rise of Skywalker . It features the new characters, like Rey and Poe and Finn, but it’s built around ones that are over 40 years old.
Listen! Luke is doing all the voiceover! Even though he died in the last one! And look! It’s Lando! Remember him? And it’s the Death Star! Again! Can’t go wrong with the Death Star! And since we never came up with a compelling villain this time around, why not just bring back the one who anchored the first six films? The Emperor! Remember that laugh? REMEMBER?
It’s the Star Wars equivalent of a Dane Cook routine: all references to cultural touchstones without any original observations. Even the title is a zombie. We already have a movie about the rise of Skywalker – we have six of the damn things, in fact.
There is an upside here. After the flavorless, vacuum-sealed Solo bombed at the box office, Disney reportedly put its other spin-offs on hold. And they gave Johnson the reins for a new trilogy, one unburdened by legions of squealing hatemongers. Same galaxy far, far away, yes – but new characters and stories, without cameos, CGI ghouls, or “fan-favorites.”
Help us, Rian Johnson; you’re our only hope.
To reference another milked-to-oblivion franchise, you cannot live inside a pensieve. But the newer Star Wars flicks tempt us to do precisely that. In our yearning to revisit the people and places we grew up loving, we’ve entered an addictive downward spiral, one which only approximates magic. We set such a low bar that Disney actually thought people wanted a young Han Solo film, seemingly forgetting that we already have one. (It’s called Star Wars , and it came out in 1977).
And look: I’m not saying that because they came first, the original movies are somehow superior. They had plenty of problems. And the newer ones are populated by a bevvy of delightful actors with terrific chemistry. I am saying that compulsively revisiting the past is more exhumation than exaltation.
And Disney is our number one graverobber."

How Hemp Production Can be Leveraged Using Technologies From Drones To AR,www.forbes.com,Maciej Duraj,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maciejduraj/2019/04/12/how-hemp-production-can-be-leveraged-using-technologies-from-drones-to-ar/?ss=healthcare,"If you are a software developer or creative professional working remotely and living in places like the Netherlands or the United States where some forms of cannabis intake are legalized, then you may have already found out that cannabis can help you focus. It can help you hone in on your work or zone out and get that code or logo finished. Cannabis has been a huge subject of debate and media attention lately due to the fact the U.S. Government made hemp legal federally and this has skyrocketed the CBD industry as a profitable farming endeavor ( even displacing other crop production in some cases and by some farmers). Hemp is not the same as marijuana or traditional cannabis because it does not contain THC or the psychoactive element that causes a high in cannabis smoking or intake. In fact, due to how similar hemp looks to marijuana, U.S. Police have been raiding hemp transportation trucks and the drivers have been put under investigative causing a controversy on enforcement.
(Keep in mind that the difference between marijuana and hemp production is quite miniscule albeit legally substantial in much of the world and explained further here . Note, the difference are subtle as both come from the same original plant: Cannabis Sativa L. Hemp is usually not smoked, but ingested orally as capsules or pills or alternatively cooked with edibles.)
I find the news very interesting living in Europe where cannabis laws vary greatly. I currently live in Poland where marijuana is outlawed, but hemp seems to be also legal and treated as a medicine (thus it may be limited to such usage), but in another country like the Netherlands the situation is entirely different legally with more openness to even standard marijuana intake or plantation. U.S., like Europe, varies state by state, however it seems to be slowly moving into the realm of full legalization as hemp is right now. Even former prosecutor and presidential hopeful Kamala Harris has said things in favor of legalizing it fully (Bernie Sanders likewise previously called for full legalization).
Now where does technology fit in Cannabis Production?
Besides being a zone out drug or a relaxation and pain alignment that can help remote workers focus on their work, or in other cases forego it entirely thus maybe not being a good idea for those personality types, there is a connection between cannabis and technology.
In fact, I found a site focusing on this connection and ways technology can be used to improve cannabis production. It is called Cannabistech . Examples include the use of drones and multispectral imagery . Augmented Reality (AR) is also something that can be leveraged in the industry .
Drones have cameras built-in and can scour an entire harvesting area with ease. Being able to capture this data and analyze it later can mean the difference between ok and amazing crop quality yields. Drones come in handy due to the cost savings and other benefits over hiring a traditional pilot to fly over the crops periodically.
Augmented reality is another technology that can be used to the benefit of the cannabis industry in being able to show how a growing cannabis plant looks like within a household or teach users how to effectively harvest the crop.
However, like any industry these days, cannabis production can greatly benefit from the Internet of Things (IoT) as a whole. With adding online connectivity, sensors and automation practices to cannabis production, companies can save money and produce better crops on a massive scale.
I have previously covered the use of robotics, IoT and machine learning algorithms for various industries, with a focus on manufacturing, and cannabis is one where I would say there is a lot of untapped potential. There is a lot of different types of cannabis one can harvest with different colors's, flavors and strengths and that come in different form factors: including oils, edibles and smoked hemp.
Being able to harvest the top quality cannabis or hemp and do it efficiently and on a massive scale can be done using automation, monitoring, with safe-checks in place, and other methods related to machine learning, AI, IoT principles and by embracing technology. Giving the right amount of water to the plants as they grow and the right amount of sunlight as well as warmth, can be crucial between success and failure.
Legalized cannabis explained
As I previously mentioned, hemp is legal in the U.S. And much of the world. It is a crop that is a hot topic right now due to potential yields. The crucial difference between hemp and traditional marijuana is the lack of the psychoactive element THC. So, in order to be safe and legal, and wanting to take a hit, be sure it is hemp you are ingesting (as edibles) or smoking.
Hemp oil production in particular has seen a huge resurgence as of late and has gaining a lot of attention amongst medical professionals due to its medical qualities in the alleviation of pain . As long as one obtains CBD from a reliable supplier it should be both safe and legal in the U.S. If you are outside of the U.S., please check our local laws on the subject.
One CBD oil producer and supplier is Verma Farms . It produces its oils THC-free, thus legal, organic, GMO-free and even vegan. There are also a variety of oils to choose form as you may know if you are an avid hemp user (there is a wide range of qualities as I mentioned above or different flavors and using IoT manufacturing can help producers in finding the right ones).
“Some manufacturers distill their products from plants doused in pesticides—which increase the risk those pesticides wind up in your supposedly all-natural purchases,” according to Verma Farms' website . “Some manufacturers adulterate their products with low-quality, synthetic ingredients. Some manufacturers do a poor job of monitoring cannabinoid levels, turning out products whose chemical components vary wildly from what they say on the label.”
The company says it uses organic and pesticide-free production methods of its oils and relies ona distilling process that is simple in nature. It also adds some naturally-occurring ingredients to the oils it produces for added flavor. It is important to choose products that offer all of the benefits of CBD in terms of health and wealness
What is interesting is that on the company's FAQ , it says the oils offer an extremely low THC presence, so for those wondering, this may mean some is still detectable or present. This may make those of you smile looking for that bit of a high and the good thing is that it is still legal due to the low amount.
“Cannabis products (like Verma’s) with extremely low THC content are no longer subject to the Controlled Substances Act. Though state laws vary and CBD products cannot be marketed with health claims without FDA approval, federal regulations no longer forbid use of low-THC CBD products.”
Verma Farms is an example of a company offering legal hemp in the form of oils and the industry is growing as a whole due to the trend in much of the modern world to legalize it.
You can read about various CBD producers here . However, be sure who you trust as some claim naturally-producing oils when in fact they do not. Quality and extractions also vary widely.
Combined with IOT production, this could be the crop of the future. Drones, AR, IoT, automation and various technologies are being utilized to produce the best crops and the companies not modernizing their production processes will be left behind. Hemp may also prove to be a great asset in the medical field as it becomes more standardized and widely available. Diseases and conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, anxiety and depression can all benefit from its intake.
New industries may also emerge or technologies developed that are needed to allow enforcement to be able to tell the difference between hemp and psychoactive marijuana. This is because drug-sniffing dogs will detect both in a similar way and the fact the only real difference is the amounts of THC present."

"Bitcoin Builds Strength Above $5,000 After Turbulent Week",www.forbes.com,Charles Bovaird,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2019/04/12/bitcoin-builds-strength-above-5000-after-turbulent-week/,"Bitcoin has been trading north of $5,000 for most of today, building strength above this key, psychological level after experiencing some tumultuous trading days. The digital currency enjoyed an upward trend for most of the week, reaching roughly $5,450 on April 10 before falling back toward $5,200, CoinDesk price data showed.
The following day, the cryptocurrency dropped below $5,000, reaching as little as $4,894.73, additional CoinDesk figures revealed.
Bitcoin prices have since recovered, breaking through $5,000 and remaining above that level for roughly the last 12 hours.
[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]
When explaining these price fluctuations, analysts pointed to technical analysis and market dynamics.
Upward Momentum
Members of the SFOX Research Team, for example, emphasized that bitcoin prices have been trending higher for most of this month.
They pointed to the 20,000-BTC order made on April 2, which threw ""supply and demand out of equilibrium"" and triggered sizable gains.
"" This rally was highly publicized in the media, which could have theoretically caused people to experience some 'FOMO,'"" they noted.
""At some point, this cycle ran out of steam (seemingly around $5500, for now), reaching a point at which sellers brought the supply and demand into balance, bringing the most recent price back to a new normalized level around $5000.""
Technical Factors
Jon Pearlstone, publisher of the newsletter CryptoPatterns , also weighed in on the digital currency's price movements, focusing on technical analysis.
He stated that:
""Bitcoin broke out of a bullish pattern above $5000, did not see any meaningful buying follow through around $5400, and has now pulled back to test the current key support level of $5000.""
""This is very typical price action during a bullish cycle,"" he emphasized, adding that ""price action continues to favor the bullish path even though we've pulled back,"" with the next ""likely target"" being $6,000.
However, he emphasized that if the digital currency falls below certain price levels amid strong enough trading activity, it could portend losses.
""A drop under $4750 with increasing volume would be the indicator to watch for that 'something else may be going on' versus typical bull cycle moves,"" he stated.

Can The Utah Jazz Upset The Houston Rockets?,www.forbes.com,Andy Bailey,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andybailey/2019/04/12/can-the-utah-jazz-upset-the-houston-rockets/,"Just under one year ago, the Utah Jazz suffered a gentlemen's sweep at the hands of the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference semifinals. The five-game series included four double-digit victories for Houston, and the Rockets outscored the Jazz by 9.5 points per 100 possessions, according to the league's website. It wasn't close.
So, other than the fact that it's happening one round earlier, what makes this series different? Can the Jazz actually upend the one team in the West that looks like it might push the Golden State Warriors? It may not be the likely outcome, but the answer to that question is: ""Yes.""
Simple Rating System (SRS), housed at Basketball Reference , combines a team's point differential with its strength of schedule. Last season, the Rockets had an 8.21 SRS, good for 27th in NBA history and first in 2017-18. This season, they're at 4.96, 197th all time and fifth in 2018-19. Utah, meanwhile, is fourth in SRS this season.
Of course, that doesn't tell Houston's full story. Before February 1, the Rockets were plus-1.5 points per 100 possessions ( 12th ). Since then, they're plus-9.9, according to NBA.com/stats . That's the best Net Rating in the NBA over that span, just ahead of Utah's plus-9. But an SRS dropoff that big is significant enough to assume the Rockets aren't quite as good as they were last season. At least they haven't shown themselves to be yet.
Maybe that's what they'll use this opening-round series for: a reminder to the league of just how high their ceiling might be. Or, maybe that's what the Jazz will do.
Again, they top the Rockets in both SRS and Net Rating this season. In the four games Houston and Utah split in the regular season, the Jazz were plus-1 point per 100 possessions and held Houston to an Offensive Rating almost 16 points below their season-long clip. James Harden played in all four of those games and averaged 35 minutes.
Of course, the catch is that three of those games came before Christmas, when Houston had yet to flip the switch. And in the February 2 meeting, the Rockets trounced Utah by 27 points. Now that they've clicked in, they're a much scarier opponent.
But, if healthy, there's reason to believe Utah's the deeper team. And that's where the Jazz will have to make hay.
If you sort every player in the NBA with 250-plus minutes this season by the average of their ranks in 10 catch-all metrics (Real Plus-Minus, Player Impact Plus-Minus, Box Plus-Minus, Win Shares per minute and Game Score per minute, as well as the cumulative variations of each), Utah has four players in the top 60 and 10 players in the top 200. Houston has three in the top 60 and seven in the top 200.
In the brief stretches when Harden is on the bench, the Jazz backups will need to be significantly better than Houston's reserves. So, while most people will focus on the need for Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell to be great (and that need is real), the more important duo might be Joe Ingles and Derrick Favors.
Despite the fact that they start, those two have more or less become the engine of Utah's second unit. They're often the first two starters to come out of the game. And in Favors' case, that usually happens pretty early. Jazz coach Quin Snyder then gets both back on the floor when the opposition starts to send its subs in. And the Ingles/Favors pick-and-roll has torn subs apart this season.
According to Cleaning the Glass , Ingles and Favors have played 925 possessions together without Mitchell, Gobert and Ricky Rubio. Utah's plus-17.2 points per 100 possessions (99th percentile) with those lineups on the floor.
Now, this isn't suggesting that the Jazz can get by on great bench play alone. Mitchell and Gobert are going to have to be stellar for Utah to stay within striking distance during Harden's minutes. It helps that both are better than they were a year ago. But it's winning those second-unit minutes that could lead to a different series outcome than the swift conference semis of 2018."

Council Post: Three Lessons Startup Founders Can Learn From The Baal Shem Tov,www.forbes.com,Moshe Reuven Sheradsky,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/04/11/three-lessons-startup-founders-can-learn-from-the-baal-shem-tov/,"Getty Founders today often feel immense stress. We want to heal a specific pain point we see in the world, and we struggle to find the balance we need to do so.
I often look to my spirituality and a higher wisdom for guidance in trying times. Yisrael Baal Shem Tov, the founder of the Chassidic movement, is one such inspiration to me. An orphan by the age of 5, young Yisrael would wander the fields and forests, meditating about the wonders of G-d's creation. One day while on one of his walks, Yisrael came across an exceptionally pious man. This man would become his mentor, leading Yisrael on a journey that would send waves into the rest of time.
Obviously, none of us have to deal with the well-being of an entire nation, but I believe we can learn a lot from his story. Here are three business lessons we can learn from Yisrael’s struggles:
1. Attend To The Basics First
When Yisrael began to walk the world as a mystic, he knew that in order for any issues of a higher order to be solved, he had to first face the issues of mundane life head-on. He started by focusing on rebuilding the Jewish people physically and materially. Strengthening the physical would allow more opportunity for the spiritual to be strengthened as well.
Similarly, this is a problem many founders in the tech world face. When we are overcome with a desire to create a piece of software to fix one aspect of the world that's in need of repair, we really want to go straight at it. Yet our lofty visions for the future have to be grounded in a very practical approach. Namely, in order to start a company, the dollars are going to matter, and some sacrifices are going to have to be made in order for us to solve the bigger issues we aim to solve.
Therefore, you may have to charge more for your software than you had originally hoped or possibly target a more wealthy social class in order to survive the initial growth stages of your startup. This may feel like you are short-changing your vision at first, yet it would be better to see it as a stepping stone toward your ultimate vision.
By strengthening the body (the financials), it gives the body the opportunity to strengthen the soul (the overarching vision of your company or product). When founders make sure they are building a good financial pathway for their companies, it frees them up more and more to build their vision.
2. Get Out Of The Building
One of the key methods of building a tech startup is the concept of getting out of the building. In other words, it's important to leave the comforts of ideation mode and actually go speak with your target audience to understand their pain points on a personal level. When you are in tune with what your customers are dealing with, you can better find and uncover what is needed for true change to take shape.
After traveling and learning with his first mentor, Yisrael was sent to live with Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Meir, like Yisrael's father, was a member of the Secret Society of Hidden Mystics. They were a group of highly esteemed, saintly individuals who would travel the world, helping people, communities and villages, while disguised as normal everyday people. This humble self-representation allowed Yisrael to get up close and personal with the masses so he could witness their daily struggles firsthand.
Like Yisrael, it's important for founders to be in a position to see what others are going through in the most authentic version of themselves.
3. Expand Your Reach By Influencing Those Who Matter Most
When you see a famous athlete wearing a shoe from a new company or an up-and-coming influencer showcasing some type of product, you are more likely to want to know more about that brand. Influencing influential people is an effective method of moving large audiences in your company's direction.
As Yisrael grew in prominence, he became known as the Baal Shem Tov. He had an elite group of disciples who would often come to him from ideologies that clashed with the one the Baal Shem Tov was leading -- a movement filled with love that championed the little guy. In fact, his disciples were often left flabbergasted at how Yisrael would focus so much of his attention on the people they knew as ""peasants.""
In influencing these influential people, the Baal Shem Tov made his vision of the world heard.
To see our startup dreams come to fruition, we have to begin with one dream, however small, and believe in the dream we build. By focusing on the practical, speaking to our customers frankly and influencing those who matter most, we can achieve the impossible.

J.J. Abrams Confirms Emperor Returns In 'Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker',www.forbes.com,Mark Hughes,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2019/04/12/j-j-abrams-confirms-emperor-returns-in-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/,"The Force was with fans today during the annual Star Wars Celebration at Chicago's Wintrust Arena, as Disney-Lucasfilm revealed the first trailer for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (formerly known as Star Wars Episode XI ). Today's trailer drop also came with the shocking revelation Emperor Palpatine, the evil Sith Lord who ruled over the galaxy in the original trilogy and who rose to power in the prequels, will return in the latest and final installment of the Star Wars saga. But does Palpatine really play a role in the film, or is it more his memory and history that bear on the story? Read on, dear readers, and find out...
Official teaser poster for Disney-Lucasfilm's ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker""
Source: Disney, Lucasfilm First, watch the trailer for yourself and see the clues about the Emperor's inevitable return in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker ...
Notice Luke's voiceover at the end of the trailer says, ""No one's ever really gone,"" repeating the final words he spoke to Leia in The Last Jedi after she says her son (Kylo) is gone. Luke's words were comforting at the time, and he gave her Han's dice from the Millennium Falcon for added subtext to his words. This time, however, Luke utters the phrase just before the trailer reveals the shattered remains of a Death Star, crashed among an ocean on an alien world, as the maniacal laughter of Emperor Palpatine echoes over the images.
So that's an obvious hint of the Emperor's return in the film. Likewise, the other footage in the trailer frequently reflects The Return of the Jedi , including Lando flying the Millenium Flacon with Chewbacca and letting out an enthusiastic laugh as they fly through hyperspace, similar to the scene of the narrow escape from the Death Star moments after Lando delivers the killing shot into the space station's reactor core. So the trailer has lots of callbacks and implications tying it to the film in which Emperor Palpatine supposedly died and the final Death Star was blown to bits.
That makes the final shot of a ruined Death Star and Palpatine's cackle seem tied into the climax of Return of the Jedi , with this being the rubble that film's Death Star on which the Emperor was supposedly killed. Which, in turn, hints at Palpatine's presence in the film.
If all of that weren't enough, at the Star Wars Celebration today with the cast and filmmakers in attendance, actor Ian McDiarmid walked out on stage to join the cast after the trailer ended. McDiarmid, of course, portrayed Palpatine in the prequel trilogy.
The implication, then, is that the Emperor either survived after all, or his evil spirit -- a Sith equivalent of a Force Ghost perhaps, retconning the pre-Disney era's expanded universe concepts which claimed Sith could not become Force Ghosts -- haunts the remnants of the Death Star.
It's also possible Palpatine is really the unnamed Sith apprentice who slew Darth Plagueis and stole the secret of cheating death. Remember, this is a story Palpatine tells to Anakin Skywalker in Revenge of the Sith , tempting Anakin to join the Dark Side in exchange for knowledge that will help Anakin save Padme from her from her foreseen death.
But regardless of how Palpatine returns, one thing is now officially beyond debate -- Palptaine is definitely returning in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker . This was confirmed by none other than director J.J. Abrams himself, per Empire Magazine's James Dyer, who said the following via his Twitter account ...
In case there's any lingering ambiguity from the trailer (and McDiarmid's appearance at the panel!), I can 100% confirm that Palptatine is back in The Rise of Skywalker as I just asked JJ. He's thrilled - and slightly incredulous - that McDiarmid's presence on set didn't leak.
So there you have it, confirmation that even if it's just for a few scenes, and/or as an evil Sith ghost of some sort who haunts the world on which his Death Star's broken pieces crashed and burned, Palpatine is destined to appear in The Rise of Skywalker .
The other big question is, who is the Skywalker referenced in the film's title? We know this film brings the Skywalker saga to an end, and we know actress Daisy Ridley has stated publicly that The Rise of Skywalker will be her final appearance in the franchise. So will she be revealed as a Skywalker after all? Did Kylo lie to her when he claimed her parents were ""nobodies?"" Was he perhaps simply mistaken, due to either being lied to by Supreme Leader Snoke, or tricked by whomever might've hidden Rey on Jakku? Or is Kylo himself the Skywalker of the title? Is he ""rising"" to a position of power as the evil leader of the galaxy? Or will he ""rise"" as a hero who turns against the forces of evil, similar to Darth Vader's own redemption in Return of the Jedi ? Or will it be Luke or Leia who ""rise"" in the film and help bring a final end to the conflict of the Skywalker saga?
Those are questions to explore at a later date, when we have more information to help us make logical guesses. For now, know that whatever else is in store for our heroes in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker , they will face the return of the franchise's most evil nemesis of all -- Emperor Palpatine.

Macau Casino Revenue Drop Doesn't Mean Sky Is Falling,www.forbes.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/muhammadcohen/2019/02/01/macau-casino-revenue-drop-doesnt-mean-sky-is-falling/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. I cover casinos and travel in Asia Share to facebook Share to linkedin The sun sets behind some of the casino resorts on Macau's Cotai Strip. (Photo: Getty) Macau casino revenue fell in January, the first year on year decrease since July 2016. The 5% decline to US$3.1 billion doesn’t mean Macau has begun a replay of the 2014-2016 slump that cratered casino revenue by 36%. For 2019, expect a lower octane gaming market in line with the slower growing mainland Chinese economy in a Macau transforming into destination that can profit from more than just gambling .
Going down 5% “wasn’t THAT bad,” JPMorgan head of Asia gaming, lodging and leisure DS Kim writes in a research note. Kim adds that January marks a third consecutive month Macau gaming revenue has beaten expectations; the January consensus forecast was a drop of 9% consensus. Boutique investment bank Union Gaming managing director in Macau Grant Govertsen writes that because Chinese New Year starts on February 5 compared with February 16 in 2018, January suffered nearly all of this year’s pre-holiday slowdown, compared February taking the brunt last year. Credit Suisse research analyst Kenneth Fong cites other unique factors hitting revenue last month, including the full casino smoking ban that took effect January 1, tighter mainland China liquidity ahead of the holiday and VIP players taking a pause and junkets focusing on collections following two months of high house win rates. After a record for visitors in 2018, Macau expects big crowds for the Chinese New Year holiday. (Photo: Getty) Getty
Sanford Bernstein global gaming analyst Vitaly Umansky writes, “On a standalone basis, January [year on year] growth is not as meaningful as looking at January/February combined.” That’s due to the holiday period falling at different times in different years. Looking at both months captures the entire picture. Bernstein expects the two months will show a year on year decline in the low single digits. Other estimates range to a rise in the mid single digits.
Those figures are interesting but they miss the bigger picture. Macau visitation set a record for December and for the year as whole. Union Gaming’s Govertsen notes the December headline numbers are inflated by bridge tourists, mostly mainlanders intent on crossing the Hong Kong-Macau-Zhuhai Bridge and not necessarily spending meaningfully. But crowds on the streets of Macau and on casino floors, along with hotel occupancy rates up 3.9 percentages points to more than 91%, evidence a very real trend. Melco's Morpheus hotel is a modern luxury icon designed by the late legendary Zaha Hadid that attracts high end visitors, whether they gamble or not. (Photo: Billy H.C. Kwok/Bloomberg) © 2018 Bloomberg Finance LP
Overnight visitors constituted a majority of Macau’s visitors for a second straight year, reaching a record 18.5 million. That’s a million more than last year and 3.9 million more than in 2014, staying an average of 2.2 days, demanding millions more hotel room nights. All of the operators except SJM Holdings have each added thousands of hotel rooms since 2014 to capture this demand, and in some cases, stimulate it. Lawrence Ho-controlled Melco Resorts’ Morpheus, a US$1 billion boutique hotel opened in June, is a modern luxury icon, the world’s first free form high-rise exoskeleton, created by acclaimed architect Zaha Hadid, with exquisitely designed interiors that evoke yacht cabins and serious Chinese and Western fine dining.
Not every casino operator has a Morpheus – Melco’s second straight new building with holes in the middle – but they’re all (except SJM) getting millions of dollars in incremental revenue from those overnight guests. Steve Wynn’s genius was, in part, realizing that 70% of hotel room revenue goes to the bottom line, compared with about 20% from a gaming table. As more of the wave of outbound middle class tourists from mainland China wash into Macau, savvy casino operators will have more paying customers for those rooms plus dining in restaurants, shopping and other non-attractions. That won’t necessarily produce the gaudy headline casino revenue numbers VIP gaming can, but it’s a more profitable play.

My Time In Brunei: Why The Hotel Boycott Over Stoning Gays Has Resonance,www.forbes.com,Richard Behar,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardbehar/2019/04/12/my-time-in-brunei-why-the-hotel-boycott-over-stoning-gays-has-resonance/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Contributing Editor of Investigations, Forbes magazine Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin ""They don't have a lot of thoughts. Jefri is the brightest [of the brothers], but everything is relative. There's been a concerted effort to keep people like you away from people like them. And it's not because they're busy.""
-- Top advisor to Prince Jefri of Brunei (a brother of the Sultan), prior to my meeting him
.
""It’s unfortunate that you have to answer a gesture of hatred with another gesture that meets it on the battlefield of violent reaction. But in this case, the guy’s [Sultan of Brunei] gotta realize that he’s gonna have to pay a very heavy price. And whatever those of us who have voices to use can do, we HAVE to do.”
--Hollywood actor Ron Perlman on the boycott of the Sultan’s five-star hotels
.
I was on the horn the other day with Ron Perlman, who was in London on the set of an upcoming BBC conspiracy thriller. The veteran actor has performed in more than 230 films, TV shows and plays — from “Hellboy” to “Sons of Anarchy;” from the role of a dishonest military officer in “A Few Good Men” to the noble monster in “Beauty and the Beast.” But it was a non-fictional beast that we were chatting about — Hassanal Bolkiah, age 72, known to the world as the Sultan of Brunei, who last week instituted death-by-stoning for certain sex acts in a country he has ruled for more than a half-century.
Those punishments apply to convictions for liwat [or sodomy, in the Malay language] between Muslim or non-Muslim men, or zina [adultery] between men and women — whether the alleged acts are committed inside or outside of Brunei. Liwat between a man and a woman who is not his wife is also stoneable. And those convicted of theft can now have their hands amputated. (The Sharia punishments, first announced in 2013 as a “great success” by the Sultan, were rolled out in phases, with the worst ones enacted nine days ago.)

Readers can torture themselves with the text of the full law here. Or spare themselves that horror by simply reading one page of it here , which begins with a bizarre and eerie fictional scenario: ""At night, in the dark, A and B have sexual intercourse. A thinks B is his wife and B thinks A is her husband, when in fact B is not A's wife and A is not B's husband..."" It goes on recite the punishments for adultery, including ""whipping with 100 strokes"" or ""stoning to death witnessed by a group of Muslims.""
As a result, Perlman said he would support George Clooney’s lead in calling for a boycott of the nine luxury hotels owned by the monarch and his family. Stars such as Ellen DeGeneres, Elton John, and Barbara Streisand have also joined in. The hotels range from the Bel-Air and iconic, century-old Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles; to London’s 88-year-old Dorchester (“the Dorch”); to Paris’s Plaza Athénée and Le Meurice; to Rome’s Hotel Eden. (Three days ago, baseball legend Joe Torre jumped onto the field by yanking his “Safe at Home"" foundation’s annual dinner from the Bel-Air. The non-profit supports children who have witnessed or experienced violence.)
To try and counter the boycott and the growing uproar against Brunei at the U.N., Brunei’s foreign minister today announced that the “aim” of the law is not to punish but to simply ""educate, deter, rehabilitate and nurture.”
Two decades ago, I visited Brunei for Fortune magazine and was treated to a rare glimpse of life behind the curtains of the 1,788-room royal palace – the world’s largest private residence, bigger than the Vatican. Until Bill Gates came along, the Sultan was the richest man on the planet. As I noted then, sorting fiction from fact — never mind getting sources to allow their names to be published— turns out to be next to impossible when writing about this shadowy monarchy, where the release of even incidental financial data can land a minister in prison. But in three countries, I met with aides to the Sultan and two of his siblings, and had the first-ever interview with Prince Jefri Bolkiah, the Sultan’s youngest brother — a dubious honor considering he was barely articulate, and apparently never sat down with a reporter again. The iconic Beverly Hills Hotel, one of nine luxury hotels that are being boycotted Wikimedia Commons
While Brunei is hardly the first country to institute such Sharia-based punishments, it’s a hypocrisy without parallel to see it happen in this minuscule, oil-rich country (pop: 438,000). For one thing, some members of the House of Bolkiah were embroiled in sex scandals, while squandering and essentially looting tens of billions of dollars from their subjects since Shell threw open the taps in the 1970s.
At the time we met in 1998, Prince Jefri — “P.J.” to his pals — was coming off a long and distinguished run as a prodigal playboy with four wives, a mistress, 30 houses around the world, and a super-yacht he named “Tits.” The ship’s tenders were Nipple 1 and Nipple 2. He was living at the time in exile, accused of mismanaging billions (and stealing some of it) from the family-controlled Brunei Investment Authority (BIA). P.J. said he was merely following a family tradition, but eventually turned everything over to the Sultan (known in his circle as the ""Big One.”)
BIA owns the nine hotels being boycotted, but you won’t find that mentioned on any of the hotels’ websites. And who owns BIA? Its 1984 charter describes it as an investment arm for the ""government."" But of course the government is an absolute monarchy (an unbroken 600-year dynasty, in fact) and can do what it pleases — such as hand out three-year prison terms to anyone disclosing BIA's affairs. ""We don't probe,"" the late Rex deSilva, longtime editor of the country’s top newspaper ( Borneo Bulletin ) once told me. ""Whose money is BIA's has not been clearly defined, and you won't be able to answer it.""
A few years before my visit to Brunei, Jefri's friends and underlings, if not Jefri himself, were wildly out of control in the sins department. Dozens, perhaps hundreds of foreign women had been paid vast sums to wiggle, giggle, and guzzle Cristal in discos — in a country where alcohol and even most nightlife was taboo. And it seems some of the women were willing to serve as more than just pretty ornaments. (One of Jefri's former advisors told me recently that a magnificent wine collection existed inside the royal palace, which he saw on a visit years after the country banned booze.) Actor Ron Perlman on the boycott of the Sultan of Brunei's luxury hotels: ""The guy’s gotta realize that he's gonna have to pay a very heavy price. And whatever those of us who have voices to use can do, we HAVE to do.” Gage Skidmore
Not to be outdone, the Sultan, a product of first cousins who married his own first cousin, became smitten in the 1970s with an airline stewardess and decided to make her his second wife. His father, until his death in 1986, refused to accept such a commoner into the family. Jefri sided with the Sultan. However — and this is key to understanding the country’s evolution from Margaritaville to Shariaville — a third brother, Mohamed, a pious, conservative Muslim with only one wife who long believed he would have made a better ruler than the Big One, sided with their dad.
The next scandal, far more sub rosa, took place around 1990 when the Sultan allegedly fell for the wife of a deputy minister. According to Jefri’s aides, the prince related to them the following story: That the Sultan was holed up at “the Dorch” in London with her, and that — as a former top advisor to the prince retold it to me recently: “Jefri said he was concerned about when and if the Sultan would return.” While in Brunei in 1998, I also met with one of the country’s leading and most respected journalists, the Borneo Bulletin’s Ignatius Stephen, who claimed that “she [the minister’s wife] enticed him to London and asked him to pose with her, and she brought pictures to Brunei and showed them to everyone.” (For a half-century until his death in 2011, Stephen covered pivotal events that shaped Brunei’s history, including details about a political rebellion against the prior Sultan in 1962.)
Seeking an interview or at least a comment from Brunei’s government about the Sultan’s alleged affair, I reached out to the country’s embassies in London and Washington, but received no responses. If one is forthcoming, it will be posted here. Moreover, Brunei officials didn't respond to numerous requests over the past week for a discussion about the new Sharia punishments.
While this Sultan has ruled since 1967, it was only in 1984 that Brunei became completely independent of Great Britain. He and P.J. began celebrating almost immediately. As detailed in the Fortune story, they bought 17 aircraft, plus 2,000 luxury cars, which they kept in a climate-controlled garage. (At one time, the Bolkiahs were the world's biggest purchasers of Rolls-Royces.) They each bought a 152-foot yacht (Jefri got perplexed and offended when anyone criticized his decision to call his Tits). When traveling abroad, the Big One whizzed around in a 747 built to carry 420 people; one of his wives had been known to tag along in a jet that seats 150. The Sultan gave one of his daughters an Airbus A340, in her favorite colors, for her 18th birthday. (Not surprisingly, the hair-shirted Mohamed flew commercial.)

Through the ‘90s, Prince Mohamed apparently grew jealous of P.J.’s friendship with the Big One. The two drove sports cars and played polo and badminton together in Brunei, while away from home they indulged similar playboy appetites. Mohamed, in contrast, was short on fun and long on prayer. To make matters worse, he was also a prominent shareholder in two major corporations in Brunei that collapsed, causing the Sultan considerable embarrassment. The failures, I discovered, weren't Mohamed's fault, but P.J. seized the chance to make some political gains. ""Jefri drove the needle fiercely into Mohamed and made him look worse in the eyes of the Sultan,"" admitted one of Jefri's top advisers. Thus alienated from the throne, Mohamed stewed, awaiting his moment.
Meanwhile, the spending sprees were staggering and utterly farcical. The Sultan bought a Renoir in the mid-1980s for $70 million — then a world record for a painting. Jefri, meanwhile, once held the record for jewelry, with a $10 million necklace. In 1997, when the Sultan turned 50, he threw himself a $17 million birthday bash that featured three concerts by (ironically enough today) Michael Jackson; Guinness called it the most lavish birthday party ever held. To learn golf, the royals flew in Jack Nicklaus. When Jefri's son Hakeem wanted to learn football in 1994, the NFL's Joe Montana and Herschel Walker were given a seven-figure incentive to teach him. Moreover, when the Sultan and Jefri visited foreign cities, they took with them an army of butlers, cooks, confidants, playmates, and hangers-on. Even the entourages had entourages.
""With their money, they could have cured diseases,"" said one of Jefri's advisers who I’d met in Paris at the Plaza Athénée (one of the nine hotels being boycotted today). ""But they have little interest in the rest of humanity. They make purchases for their own edification. They get their jollies for about 30 seconds at a shot.""
By all accounts, by the mid-90s, Muhamed had come to see his brother as a national threat — a fear shared by Brunei's Education Minister (and Grand Mufti), Pehin Haji Abdul Aziz , the country's most powerful conservative. As it happened, two scandals would come along and annihilate the monarchy's reputation in the foreign press, paving the way for a religious backlash.
The first scandal was the previously-cited problem of the droves of foreign women dancing and drinking in Brunei. The second scandal: What was billed in 1998 as the most expensive civil case in English history revealed that Jefri and the Sultan had shelled out roughly $1 billion for hundreds of luxury items that the sellers had marked up by 100% to 600%. Among them: Jefri h ad paid $10 million f or ten luxury watches that showed a man and woman copulating mechanically on the hour. A set of louche pens, also featuring a copulating couple, had been crafted in white gold. He even bought a gold pool table.
Back in Brunei, Mohamed and Aziz, the conservative minister, had seen enough. Two months after the British case was settled, Bruneian authorities began freezing the domestic assets of Jefri's local companies. Conveniently, both the Sultan and Jefri were overseas at the time, but when the Big One returned, ""Acting Sultan"" Mohamed claimed that the firms collapsed under the weight of their own excesses. The Sultan put Mohamed in charge of fixing the economy, while Aziz was given the helm of a task force assigned to investigate P.J.'s spending. Aziz also gave a rare briefing. He warned citizens of lies being told through the foreign media. He invoked the name of God five times and declared that his investigation of the monarchy’s assets was being conducted ""solely for the sake of Allah the Almighty.""
Skipping ahead to today, Aziz and Mohammed proceeded to build a religious power base that has expanded over the years. In fact — better gird your loins — there's even a Jefri Bolkiah Mosque now. It boasts a ""charity cube"" for the public to donate food and toiletries for needy families that the Brunei Times (a paper that was subsequently shut down by the monarchy after it tried to assert a teeny bit of press freedom) said ""went viral"" when it was announced in 2016.
As for the Big One, has he genuinely become as devout as he now comes across? It’s possible, but he is at least smart enough to realize that — excluding the U.K.’s all-but-powerless Queen Elizabeth — he is the world’s longest-ruling monarch. As Brunei’s citizens either grow eve n more conservative or are pushed that way, the Sultan may be putting his chips on the idea that having Brunei be the first country in the Islamist-veering neighborhood (read: Malaysia and Indonesia) to adopt such draconian punishments can bolster his credentials and keep him in power longer. On the other hand, much of Southeast Asia is not Muslim and this type of behavior could equally create tension and schisms. LONG ON PRAYER, SHORT ON FUN: Prince Mohamed Bolkiah, greeting U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in 2014, before commencing a meeting between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the U.S. photocredit: ASSOCIATED PRESS
As an absolute monarchy, the chance that a docile, adult population (more than half of whom work for the government) could push the Sultan out is small, but at what point does pressure from the outside for outrageous behavior within the legal system and his own history of excess lead to the pot boiling over? (More critically, why have things gone this way in a place where it is questionable whether true beliefs are his driving factor?)
The concept of a coup is not foreign to him. In fact, it may cross his mind every two years. How so? In 1962, British troops helped his father crush an uprising by a small group of leftists who wanted to bring down the monarchy. To restrict the freedoms of citizens, a state of emergency was declared, which the Sultan has renewed biannually since he took the reins in 1967. Two decades ago, I brought up the subject of the government’s state of emergency at a meeting in London with Yosef Sepiuddin, one of the Sultan’s closest overseas aides. ""We haven't had any elections — so what? — the people are happy,"" he said.
Of course, when Brunei's oil runs out in an estimated 15 years, the people may start getting a little grumpy. While the country today is the world's fourth richest (by GDP per capita), the monarchy has done virtually nothing to try and diversify its economy. While in Brunei, I met with the country’s tourism chief, Sheikh Jamaluddin bin Sheikh Mohamed (known informally as “Sheikh Jimmy.”) He was hilarious and very open about the Herculean task he faced of luring tourists to boring Brunei.
""It's showtime for Brunei,"" he exclaimed. ""It's time to show Brunei off to the world. Nobody knows where the hell we are. All they know is the Sultan of Brunei is the world's richest man. They think we're in the Middle East...Nobody is in my way. When I first met Aziz, I thought he would throw out Koranic verses. He said he could see the need for tourism."" And that was 1998 , long before stoning laws were even considered possible by Brunei's aristocracy. Today, Sheikh Jimmy is a consultant working to match local entrepreneurs with foreign investors. “We know Brunei best,” beams his company's website. P erhaps that's one reason why Jimmy isn’t returning messages this week.
Meanwhile, executives are lying low at the “Dorchester Collection,” which manages Brunei’s nine five-star hotels. They deactivated their social media pages, and posted a statement on their website’s homepage that is almost as murky as the babble the monarchy shovels out to its hoi polloi. It reads: “…this is a political and religious issue that we don’t feel should be played out in our hotels and amongst our 3,630 hotel employees. We’re deeply saddened by what’s happening right now.”
Play ? Who is playing? And note how the management won't utter the unspeakable. They don't define what “this” is. (Perhaps the words “stoning"" of ""gays"" and ""adulterers"" are not fit to print?) We can safely assume “played out” means boycott, and “what’s happening right now” refers to both the kill-by-rocks statute and the boycott. Maybe the Dorch's collection of execs are hoping many of its customers are too dumb to read news stories in order to decipher those website tea leaves.
Similarly, you'll see nothing about the new punishments (other than comments from readers) on the Facebook page of the U.S. Embassy in Brunei. However, its website does have a security alert, which warns that the ""Syariah Penal Code... applies regardless of an individual’s religion or nationality, although some sections of the law have specific applicability to Muslims….For specific questions regarding the SPC, contact a syariah attorney.” The embassy webpage provides a list of law firms in Brunei that it says are qualified to provide counsel. But good luck with that. I reached out to four of the law firms, seeking clarification about which punishments would apply to visitors, but none of the four responded.

U.S. Embassy officials have in the past expressed many concerns about the punishments, including that a confession “could be used in lieu of evidence, and that those accused could be coerced by social pressure to confess.” Coincidentally, the mini-series that actor Ron Perlman is working on for BBC — titled “The Capture” — has a plot that one can easily imagine unfolding in today's Brunei: An unjustly arrested man is framed by video fakery. ( Of course, in Brunei’s case, a real video would also be an abomination.)
“What it boils down to,” says Perlman about Brunei’s new punishments, “is that the most base act of savagery comes in response to the most pristine act of loving, and it’s something not only completely incongruous — that doesn’t even begin to describe it — but it boggles the mind and it’s the epitome of medieval philosophies that are completely articulated out of hatred. This is hatred of the other in its most bleak and savage form.”
As for the hotel boycott, he adds: “There’s so much noise out there, and there’s so much savagery going on in the world right now that we’ve almost reached a point where we’ve become anesthetized into wondering ‘What the hell else can we do?’ — except, you know, thoughts and prayers, which we all know what that leads to. It has to be a public awareness thing. It’s got to be just obliterating the airwaves with this savagery. There are certain things we have to grin and bear, and there are certain things that are intolerable. And to stone somebody for simply engaging in the act of loving someone is one of the intolerables .” Brunei boycott initiator George Clooney, during a news conference in 2008, when he was designated a UN Messenger of Peace. BLOOMBERG NEWS
Will the boycott spread and have a major effect on the bottom lines of the kingdom’s five-star hotel group? Maybe not, g iven the Twitter-sized attention spans of most people nowadays. And yet the behavior of the royals has been and remains so odious that perhaps there will be lasting effects. “I use my voice on social media,” shrugs Perlman. “I don’t know what else to do. I don’t hold any office. I’m not a legislature . I’m not somebody who can effect real change. I can articulate things and hopefully get other people to understand. And hopefully when enough people understand and enough people start showing this guy [Sultan] they’ll have nothing to do with anything he’s involved in, then maybe he’ll start to get affected by it. It has to be a much more sustained effort that permeates the zeitgeist.”
Perhaps that's where boycott initiator George Clooney comes in. ""When George comes out for something — for me, it turned my head,"" says Perlman. ""Probably the guy who has the most goodwill in our industry – because he’s always very measured, very, very humane, and doesn’t use his celebrity in ways that are dismissable — is Clooney. The way he chooses his projects, the way he’s maintained his integrity about doing work that’s more beautiful than it is commercial. And that just crosses over into the efforts he puts his shoulders behind, which are really things that the public needs to be made aware of.""

Are Home Offices Fueling a Mental Health Crisis?,www.forbes.com,Laurel Farrer,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurelfarrer/2019/04/12/are-home-offices-fueling-a-mental-health-crisis/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin Since the inception of assembly lines, a single work model has not had as much impact on global socioeconomics as the rise of telecommuting. From workforce equality , to environmental sustainability , to economic development , Working from home puts professionals at higher risk for mental health concerns. Getty
In the 2019 State of Remote Work report produced by Buffer, the thousands of remote workers surveyed rave about the work-life balance, schedule flexibility, and work performance, that being able to work offsite lends in their lives. However, when asked about the downsides of location flexibility, 49% of remote workers note that their biggest struggle is wellness-related. More specifically, 22% can’t unplug after work, 19% feel lonely and 8% can’t stay motivated.
These statistics could have a number of subjective influencers, such as the management style of their boss, their local connection speed, their personality or even which organization tools are used. However, there is one dominant common thread that can’t be ignored: 84% of all remote workers are working from a home office.
The ability to work from anywhere has recently sparked the digital nomad movement in which professionals are able to travel the world, packing nothing but a laptop to keep them active in a part-time or full-time job. As glamorous as this might look on social media, the reality is that most remote workers are anxious to leave the time and distance of traveling during their commuting days, and instead just clock in from where they are already at.
Any remote worker will tell you that replacing suits with slippers is a liberating transition. However, it seems as though the confining corporate cubicles that we are so anxious to escape may actually be boosting our behavioral health. Dr. Amy Cirbus, PhD, LMHC, LPC, and Manager of Clinical Quality a t Talkspace , reports, “ Specifically, they report feelings of isolation and loneliness and high rates of worry about job performance and stability. Insomnia and sleep disturbance are common, along with increased fatigue, irritation, sadness and feelings of disconnection. Remote workers report a lack of concentration and focus that can compound and exacerbate these mental health challenges. It can lead to a loss of self-worth and a questioning of one’s abilities. Combined together, these symptoms can have a significant impact on job performance, job satisfaction and the efficiency of productive work.”
But why? If virtual professionals are claiming that work-life balance and lower stress convinced them to go remote, then where are these negative effects coming from? Hidden among the dream of flexibility and independence are these subtle dangers: The freedom of higher autonomy also results in a heavier operational load of self-management responsibilities including IT troubleshooting, time management and task prioritization. A lack of environmental markers in career development (such as moving from a small cubicle into a large corner office) can prevent workers from recognizing progress and achievements. Over time, this can lead to concerns like career stagnancy or imposter syndrome. Freelancers (over 36% of the U.S. workforce) have the unique pressure of both finding work and producing it. This constant state of being in “the hustle” can contribute to sustained stress. Because the success of distributed teams is often measured by results, workers can be tempted (or pressured) to overwork to inflate their output. This can result in unpaid hours, lack of sleep, poor engagement in personal relationships or mental burnout. The idyllic serenity of an uninterrupted home office environment easily translates into deeply focused work sessions, which is great for productivity, but terrible for ergonomic health. The distractions of coworkers and bustling office activity subconsciously prompt us to take break from our sedentary work often enough to maintain visual, auditory, mental and chiropractic health. Speaking of chiropractic health, without significant intention and investment, most home offices are not equipped with ergonomic seating options. Over time, a worker’s chin, shoulders, and back being in a compromised position can contribute to feelings of stress and depression. When workers are geographically isolated, they can easily be informationally isolated as well, which prevents access to the resources they need to complete tasks. Compromised efficiency can cause increased worry about job performance, team trust, feelings of safety in job security and a lack of confidence. Poorly defined physical boundaries between a worker’s personal life and professional life (such as working from bed) can lead to poorly defined boundaries in time and mental thought processes, causing a difficulty in “unplugging.”
Does this mean that the Remote Work Revolution is doomed to fail ? Should we all return to our offices for the sake of our mental wellness? Like the natural selection of all permanent species, the key to success isn’t to revert, it’s to adapt. Instead of racing back to headquarters to cure your office FOMO , try these strategies to keep your mind and emotions sharp:
1. Invest in a Home Office - If you are going to spend almost 24 hours a day in a single environment, it should certainly be a place that inspires and supports you. Mentally trigger schedule boundaries between your personal and professional time by defining a dedicated space to work. Then, deck it out with ergonomic features like supportive seating, lifted screens and over-ear headphones.
2. Diversify Interests - To strengthen confidence that isn’t defined by your work output, develop a sense of fulfillment outside of work. Stick to strict working hours, then contrast it with some exclusively personal and/or social time, such as participating in a group hobby, exploring local attractions as a family, or volunteering at a local organization.
3. Communicate Transparently - Anyone who maintains a long-distance relationship with a loved one can testify that a connection is only as strong as your communication. No matter how introverted you may or may not be, avoid feeling isolated by building a variety of channels of support to discuss your life (both personal and professional) with. Virtual coworker meetups , starting a video chat thread with a coworker, or chatting with a mental health professional for advice are great places to start.
4. Increase Movement - It’s dangerously easy to fall into a sedentary lifestyle when you live and work in the same few hundred square feet. To improve your mental, cardiovascular, visual and emotional health take breaks often during your work day, but not just a quick rabbit hole watching YouTube videos. For maximum benefit, step away from the screen and really get the blood moving with a short walk or workout.
5. Build a Support Network - Let’s face it, life isn’t always sunshine and rainbows, so design some umbrellas to use on the chance that a rain cloud shows up. Whether it be friends or fencing, figure out strategies that engage your soul and stimulate your brain, then integrate them into your life so they are easily accessible in times of need.
The short version is this: the government enforces thousands of occupational policies to keep you happy and healthy at work. When you create your own office, the importance of these regulations is not voided. But they are now your responsibility to design and enforce. Invest in your work by investing in your self-care, which can be as easy as plugging a few jumping jacks and personal phone calls into your daily routine. “ Research indicates that both exercise and connecting with others, even in short bursts, produces endorphins that boost mood, increase creativity and esteem, and decrease anxiety,” Dr. Cirbus encourages. “The key is the consistency. One afternoon walk or one lunch break with a colleague or friend won’t eliminate these mental health challenges. Making a daily commitment to healthy injections of well being on a regular basis is where the positive, lasting change occurs.”
Do you have strategies that strengthen your behavioral health while working remotely? Is there something in your office that keeps you feeling sharp and engaged?

"With Luke Walton Gone, The Lakers Have Another Huge Problem",www.forbes.com,Gabe Zaldivar,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gabezaldivar/2019/04/12/with-luke-walton-gone-the-lakers-have-another-huge-problem/,"The Los Angeles Lakers and Luke Walton have decided to amicably break up. As we all know, there is no such thing. Someone always gets the better end of the deal during a split. In this particular relationship, it seems as though Walton is the one with a sweet, new romance ready for him the second he exits the building.
The Lakers released the news on Friday afternoon. Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka, via press release, expressed gratitude for his departing head coach: “We would like to thank Luke for his dedicated service over the last three years.”
Like two people breaking up over a bottle of wine at a fancy dinner, Walton also had kind things to say about the organization.
I want to thank Jeanie Buss and the Buss family for giving me the opportunity to coach the Lakers. This franchise and the city will always be special to me and my family.
When it comes to Walton, there may be some truth to this “mutually” aggregable separation. The latest rumor is that Vlade Divac and the Sacramento Kings are eager to get a deal done and have Walton coach their respective young core after that organization parted ways with Dave Joerger.
As expected, source tells @TheAthletic that Kings GM Vlade Divac will now reach out to Luke Walton to schedule an interview now that his Lakers days are done. As I reported yesterday, Walton is Divac's first choice for this job.
— Sam Amick (@sam_amick) April 12, 2019
If true, Walton will have an opportunity to coach a team whose front office actually wants him around and will give him a firm backing from day one.
He would also have his own prolific core to coach with De’Aaron Fox, Buddy Hield and Marvin Bagley III all proving that brighter days are ahead in Sacramento.
Also gone is that immense pressure that comes when you have an aging LeBron James on the roster. After succumbing to a groin injury this season, the Lakers are very much in a win-now scenario.
But really, it’s anyone’s guess as to what direction this team goes to fill the head coaching vacancy, the opening left by Magic Johnson as president of basketball operations or the gaping hole that needs to be filled on the roster.
The latest scuttlebutt has Monty Williams and Ty Lue as potential frontrunners for the gig. But it would be mindboggling for the Lakers to hire someone before the most important question is answered.
The Monty Williams candidacy is a serious one with the Lakers, league sources tell ESPN. He has history with LeBron James as a Team USA assistant and a successful run w/ Pelicans as a head coach. Ty Lue checks the boxes too: ex-Laker, championship coach, LeBron James-approved.
— Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) April 12, 2019
Does Jeanie Buss fill Magic’s vacancy? If so, we would assuredly have to wait until that moment to gauge head coaching candidates.
Ah, but the Lakers are not interested in what makes sense.
Buss could very well give full power to Pelinka, which would be a catastrophic decision considering some of the reporting surrounding the former agent.
Sadly, ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne suggests that it will indeed be Pelinka’s show to run.
Pelinka will run the Lakers coaching search. As @wojespn reported Ty Lue is one of the leading candidates. The expectation is they will talk to others, too, though.
— Ramona Shelburne (@ramonashelburne) April 12, 2019
The L.A. Times’ Broderick Turner spelled out a number of reasons backing Pelinka wholeheartedly at this juncture is a horrible idea.
One agent told the Times, “I just don’t see how they do anything going forward with Rob in place; No one trusts him.”
Someone described simply as a general manager expounded on the Lakers front office upheaval.
To tell you the truth, they should go out and get a top executive in the league to run everything. That’s what they need to do. Go get a guy that can get this done. There’s no reason why it shouldn’t get done. Go get an executive that’s done it or who has built something.
There was reason to believe Walton would stay with the Lakers until a new regime was in place. So while there was no expectation he was going to coach the Lakers next season, the timing of his departure is certainly another surprise for an already confounding week.
It makes me question the common wisdom around the league that Pelinka should be the next one shown the door.
From the look of things on Friday, the former agent may be the one person to survive this entire mess.
That just means Buss and the Lakers are attempting to fix one problem while another continues to go largely overlooked."
Should Symantec Investors Worry About HYPR?,www.forbes.com,Peter Cohan,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2019/04/12/should-symantec-investors-should-worry-about-hypr/,"Security software maker Mountain View, California-based Symantec has been struggling for years -- but a turnaround is in the offing according to Goldman Sachs. Yet Symantec is facing stiff competition from a fast-growing startup that offers password-less security.
Is this a big enough threat to Symantec for investors to ignore Goldman's bullish call? Symantec declined to comment on the record.
(I have no financial interest in the securities mentioned in this post).
Symantec is in the cybersecurity business offering ""consumer digital safety and enterprise security."" Its consumer products include Norton-branded security services and LifeLock identity protection. It sells endpoint, network, web, and cloud security solutions to companies -- these account for most its revenues while its consumer products supply the bulk of its profits.
Over the last five years, the stock has gained nearly 19% -- the S&P 500 increased 56% during that time -- an uninspired performance characterized by considerable bouncing up and down between a low slightly south of $17 in 2016 to nearly $33 last September. The shares have risen in 2019 from $19 to nearly $24.
Symantec's revenues have been shrinking and its profitability has been hard to discern. Over the last five years, its revenue has declined at a 6.9% annual rate to $4.83 billion in 2018 when it earned no profit, according to Morningstar .
But in March, Symantec gave investors an upside surprise. It reported fiscal third-quarter results ""that surpassed analysts' expectations. The company posted revenue of $1.22 billion, roughly 3% above consensus forecasts, and said that stronger operating margins helped it beat per-share earnings expectations,"" according to TheStreet.com
This prompted Goldman Sachs to upgrade its stock on April 8 on the back of what it called signs of ""sustained growth"" from its current billings and prompting its shares to pop 7% after Goldman set a 12 month price target of $28 -- up from its previous target of $23.
Goldman wrote that for its upcoming fiscal year, Symantec would ""should show improvement on essentially every key metric, driven by a return to more normalized execution, stabilization in business mix, and the benefit of revenue already on the balance sheet,"" according to the Street.com .
But there is plenty of competition in Symantec's markets. For example, in the $18 billion Identity and Access Management and User Authentication security market, Symantec partners with Okta , through its Technology Integration Partner Program. (Here is Gartner's analysis of customer reviews of access management products including Symantec's VIP Access Manager.)
Symantec faces competition from rivals including HYPR , a Manhattan-based provider of ""decentralized authentication, enabling true password-less security.""
HYPR -- which says it grew 400% between 2017 and 2018 and expects to repeat that performance this year -- has raised $13.8 million in outside capital.
HYPR believes that hackers are going after centralized password stores when they target the likes of LinkedIn, Yahoo, and Twitter. According to my January 2019 interview with CEO George Avetisov, ""We are solving the problem of big breaches in which hundreds of millions of passwords are stolen. The number one initiative of chief information security officers is to get rid of passwords.""
The key to HYPR's solution -- which is being adopted by MasterCard -- is to shift authentication from the supplier's database to consumers' smartphones. ""A lot of people have the same password for each of their accounts. HYPR moves account keys from a central store to your phone. This means that the hacker can't attach the bank's network -- he as to attack each user's phone,"" said Avetisov.
Mastercard started using HYPR in 2017 and as a result ""has reduced mobile payment fraud, essentially stopped credential reuse attacks, and enhanced its user experiences with faster, hassle-free transactions,"" according to Cardrates .
HYPR was started in 2014. As Avetisov, a Brooklyn Tech graduate , explained, ""We started the company with three cofounders. We wanted to make use of the iPhone 5S's fingerprint reader and we got MasterCard as an early customer. We raised capital from RRE Ventures. We will grow revenues at over 400% in 2018 and have nearly 50 employees in New York City, Toronto, and London.""
HYPR has won some bids against Symantec and shares at least one account with this rival. ""MasterCard uses solutions from HYPR and Symantec. First Citrus Bank chose HYPR in a competitive bid against Microsoft, Symantec and RSA,"" he said.
First Citrus is pleased with the HYPR solution. As First Citrus VP/Information Technology Officer, Joe Kynion, explained in a March 13 interview, ""If our customers' passwords are stolen, we lose their trust. [We decided that the best way to address our] cybersecurity issues was decentralized, password-less security management. [We considered] the RSA [SecurID hardware token and found that it] was not scalable. We started using HYPR a month ago. While not everyone is using biometric authentication, we are moving in that direction.""
HYPR charges companies based on the number of users per year in the range of $75 to $100 for a service that provides consumer authentication and employee access. The costs to enterprises using a legacy password system are in the range of $17 to $80 per user.
HYPR has to endure very long sales cycles since it is working with financial institutions. As Avetisov said, ""Procurement takes a long time. It is political and bureaucratic and we need to convince people on the business side, in the information technology department, and the chief information security officer.""
And there is lots of competition -- but HYPR believes it enjoys a competitive advantage. ""Gartner says there are 200 vendors in the space. But there are only a few that offer password-less security. There are lots of tw0-factor authentication providers -- but they don't remove the password. We win because we offer decentralized password-less mobile security,"" he said.
What's more, HYPR sees a $20 billion addressable market consisting of $18 billion in revenue for employee authentication and another $2 billion for consumer authentication.
Companies like Microsoft and Google are working on the same problem -- so it remains to be seen whether HYPR will be able to maintain its technological lead, fall behind, or will be acquired.
Meanwhile, Symantec's recent resurgence suggests that HYPR is not a big threat to its growth -- though perhaps it would make a tasty acquisition."
Toy Review: DC Universe Animated Justice League Superman and Flash,www.forbes.com,Luke Y. Thompson,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukethompson/2019/04/12/toy-review-dc-universe-animated-justice-league-superman-and-flash/,"Though DC Comics streaming service DC Universe hasn't quite become the next big thing, with its shows recently making their initial episodes available for free in hopes of hooking ne viewers, and total numbers since last summer rumored to be only around 700,000 , the exclusive Justice League action figures have been well-received by those who've bought them. DC pointedly did not make all of them available at launch, and while I checked out their offerings back then , DC Collectibles recently sent the final two figures -- Superman and Flash -- for review. It's not clear if there will be any more after this, as the DC action figure license appears to be mainly going to McFarlane Toys and Spin Master sometime next year. But as best I can discern from my contacts, DC Collectibles will continue in some form, despite earlier rumors otherwise. How DC Universe will fare once Warner Bros. launches its own streaming service remains a big question mark.
Checking off the boxes
Luke Y. Thompson The packaging is what we've seen before -- the standard DC Collectibles box with a bit more color. But once you remove them, you're going to wish more than ever that these figures came with doll stands. Superman is the most top-heavy of the bunch, and Flash is very lightweight and falls down easily. Flash is the smallest male human in the bunch, while Superman is majorly exaggerated above the waist. While most superhero toy lines would give them similar physiques, this one definitely does not, and perhaps the entirely unique body sculpts are why these figures cost more. ($28)
Little and large.
Luke Y. Thompson As far as articulation, both figures have ball-jointed necks, shoulders, elbows, and wrists, rocker-hinge combo hips, hinge knees and ankles, and cut joints at the tops of their boots. Superman also has a cut wrist joint, since he has a belt that can conceal it where Flash does not.
""Justice boogie, da-da-da, da-da-da-da...""
Luke Y. Thompson The color and design work is impeccable, and what you're paying for. Paint lines are sharp, and skin-colored parts are cast in textured skin-colored plastic to differentiate from the costume smoothness. Superman has no yellow S on his cape in this incarnation, but the Flash's chest logo has levels.
Bambi-legs
Luke Y. Thompson Both display decently with the rest, but you really will want to get some waist-clipping stands if you don't ever expect them to fall over. I feel like for this particular incarnation of the League, statues make for better collectibles. If you actually intend to play with your toys, however, these can certainly assist."
It's Hard To Get Excited For 'Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker',www.forbes.com,Dani Di Placido,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2019/04/12/its-hard-to-get-excited-for-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/,"Have you ever played “Consequences?” It’s an old parlor game, the kind of thing you do when you’re young, bored, deprived of electrical entertainment. The gist of the game is that each player takes turns to write lines of a story, folding the paper to hide the previous line before passing it on to the next player. Then, you all laugh at the inevitably mismatched, nonsensical story, before asking if there’s any alcohol in the building. I bring this up because, judging from the way The Last Jedi veered away from plot points clearly set up in The Force Awakens , like Rey’s parentage and Snoke’s …. purpose, The Rise Of Skywalker looks to be going in a very different direction from The Last Jedi .
At least, that’s what the marketing seems to be communicating . “Let the past die. Kill it, if you have to,” has been quietly forgotten, as the (ghostly?) return of Luke Skywalker, and even Emperor Palpatine, are the highlights of the new teaser trailer .
Palpatine was never a part of the sequel trilogy, his death being a major plot point of the original films, Darth Vader’s redemption and sacrifice, so it seems strange to bring him back again.
I think it’s fair to assume that Snoke’s untimely death took J.J. Abrams by surprise, subverting expectations the way the twist was designed to do, and perhaps Palpatine was chosen as a replacement, seeing as Snoke was essentially Diet Palpatine anyway.
In an interview with Fast Company (via The Playlist ), Abrams appears to confirm the haphazard structure of the sequel trilogy, stating:
It was a completely unknown scenario. I had some gut instincts about where the story would have gone. But without getting in the weeds on Episode VIII , that was a story that Rian wrote and was telling based on seven before we met. So he was taking the thing in another direction. So we also had to respond to Episode VIII . So our movie was not just following what we had started, it was following what we had started and then had been advanced by someone else.
Abrams also confirms his initial reluctance to direct Episode IX :
I wasn’t supposed to be there .... The whole thing was a crazy leap of faith. And there was an actual moment when I nearly said, ‘No, I’m not going to do this.
The original plan for Episode IX was to have Colin Trevorrow write and direct the film, but Trevorrow was discarded, along with his script, after his film The Book of Henry bombed, failing to impress both critics and audiences . That abrupt shift didn’t leave a great deal of time for Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio to work out a new script, as talented as the two storytellers are.
To have no script and to have a release date and have it be essentially a two-year window when you’re saying (to yourself), you’ve got two years from the decision to do it to release, and you have literally nothing . . . . You don’t have the story, you don’t have the cast, you don’t have the designers, the sets. There was a crew, and there were things that will be worked on for the version that preceded ours, but this was starting over …. the lack of absolute inevitability, the lack of a complete structure for this thing, given the way it was being run was an enormous challenge.
That’s not a particularly reassuring statement. The original trilogy (and even the much-maligned prequel trilogy), had a wonderfully structured story arc that perfectly unfolded across their three films. George Lucas may have tweaked his initial structure along the way, adding and subtracting ideas here and there, but his iconic space opera felt wholly organic, a perfect example of The Hero's Journey.
The sequels took the opposite approach, using three different storytellers to craft an interconnected trilogy, lacking an overarching blueprint. It’s the polar opposite of how Marvel carefully constructed their films, never straying from the grand plan; a decade later, it’s clear that Marvel’s structured approach paid off.
The dramatic contrast between the nostalgia-tickling Force Awakens and the intense subversion of the Last Jedi was jarring; even the hopeful shot of Luke Skywalker at the end of Force Awakens clashed bitterly with the scene where Luke tossed the lightsaber in Last Jedi . It was intentional, of course, but that doesn’t mean it worked.
There’s likely to be another awkward tonal clash in The Rise Of Skywalker - in fact, it’s already there, in the title. Abrams certainly had his work cut out for him in this film, having to please a (largely) disappointed fanbase and wrap up the unexpected loose ends.
Despite the overwhelming odds, however, the story could end up a success. Abrams believes so, stating:
I feel like we’re in a place where we might have something incredibly special. So I feel relief being home, and I feel grateful that I got to do it. And more than anything, I’m excited about what I think we might have.
Hopefully, he’s right; I don’t think I’m ready for another fan rebellion."

Napa County Passes Contentious Water And Tree Protection Provision,www.forbes.com,msn.com,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizazimmerman/2019/04/12/napa-county-passes-contentious-water-and-tree-protection-provision/,"After close to a year of non-stop debate about how to protect agriculture and support commerce, the Napa County Board of Supervisors (BOS) passed the final ordinance on Water Quality and Tree Protection last Tuesday April 9 th . It was adopted by a vote of 5-0, with provisions for it to take effect in 30 days. Brad Wagenknecht, a supervisor at the Napa Valley BOS, shares in a recent interview that, “the Board has worked on this for such a long time.” He adds that, as a result, “I think you will be able to recognize the Napa Valley in 50 years.”
Not everyone was so happy with the outcome. Stu Smith, the owner of the St. Helena-based Smith-Madrone Vineyards and Winery says the vote was a “perversion of due process.” He adds that “they didn’t attempt to present any science. It was sheer back-room dealing.”
What Locals Think
No one seems happy with the immediate solution. The BOS was “anxious to address this issue, or set of issues, as soon as possible and were successful in that regard. Clearly some folks didn’t think the County went far enough, while others questioned the need to take any action at all,” says Rex Stults, government relations director at the St. Helena-based Napa Valley Vintners (NNV).

Getty “As the NVV represents 553 Napa Valley wineries, we had a diversity of opinions within our own membership and some vintners were leaders in encouraging greater restrictions, while others led the ‘no further regulations’ movement.” He adds that, “one can’t say whether or not it was good for producers, because the producers don’t all share the same perspective.”
Neither Jim Wilson or Mike Hackett, the Napa Valley’s resident creators of Prop C, which did not pass last June, responded to requests for comment for this story. Smith imagines that they were not happy about the final results either.
“Both sides are unsatisfied with the decision,” agrees Rob McMillan, the Napa-based founder and executive vice president of the Silicon Valley Bank Wine Division. “The County Supervisors will never find a solution that will placate all sides in this debate. One side is fighting for an end to changes in undeveloped areas in the hills of Napa and the other side is fighting to protect the right to farm in those same undeveloped areas. The fight is over a way of life, land and colliding visions of the future where there is no middle ground.”
“It is a compromise,” notes Beth Novak Milliken president and CEO of the Spottswoode Winery in St. Helena, California. “I don’t think it is sufficient to protect our oak woodlands and water resources and while this is disappointing, the spotlight is now on these natural resources, so I believe there will be greater scrutiny on development in our ag watershed –[or] any development, not just vineyards – and this is a positive outcome.”
“We remain disappointed that the BOS rushed to pass ‘something’ just months after the election and never took the time to identify exactly what, or if, problems exist prior to adopting ‘solutions,’” says Michelle Benvenuto, the executive director of the Wine Growers of Napa Valley which is based in St. Helena. “As a result, it is a flawed ordinance which leaves us with more questions than answers.”
What the Future Holds
The valley’s residents are less than unified in their vision about how the new ruling will be enforced. “It was a wrong-headed attempt to stave off an[other potential] initiative,” says Smith about why the BOS passes this measure.
McMillan says that this decision is really only one more battle in a lingering war. He adds that, since this has passed, “Some question the practical impact of the changes. Just how many trees were saved? How much additional open space was created? Is the watershed any better protected now? For one side the answer is ‘not enough’ and they will now reload and start up a new battle in the war. That’s probably the only thing that is certain.”"
"Vasiliy Lomachenko Vs. Anthony Crolla Live Results, Purses, Odds",www.forbes.com,Josh Katzowitz,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshkatzowitz/2019/04/12/vasiliy-lomachenko-vs-anthony-crolla-live-results-purses-odds/,"POSTFIGHT: And that's why I have Lomachenko as my No. 1 pound for pound fighter. Here's the confirmation. *plop* pic.twitter.com/Td3CHZ1HgR
— DICK HERCULES (@RatCatcherMpls) April 13, 2019
After the fight, Lomachenko told ESPN he wants to fight Mikey Garcia but that he's going to stay at 135 pounds. He said he wants to unify all titles, which also might mean he's wanting a shot at Richard Commey, who was originally supposed to fight Lomachenko but who injured his hand and had to bow out. Prospect Teofimo Lopez also has expressed interest in meeting Lomachenko.
It was also interesting to hear ref Jack Reiss explain to Crolla why he stopped the fight. ""Anthony, I love you,"" Reiss said as Crolla was still on the canvas. ""But just watch the tape. You can't even move.""
Fourth round: But he got knocked down by a right hook, and he's done. Reiss stops the fight.
Third round: Man, a big three-punch combo from Loma in the first minute. That last one snapped his head back. He's getting beating up in this round. Yikes. Loma smacks him with a left to the face. Loma is opening up, and Crolla can't do much of anything to stop him. Crolla lands a right. Hey, he landed something! He traps Crolla on the ropes, and Crolla isn't answering back. And ref Jack Reiss calls him down . Lomachenko thinks the fight has been stopped. Officials have entered the ring. Reiss tells them to get the hell out of the ring. Reiss called it a knockdown because he determined Crolla was being held up by the ropes. Forbes scores it for Loma.
Overall: Loma 30-26
Second round: A few jabs for Loma on Crolla. And through the first 4 minutes of this fight, and he hasn't done anything of consequence. Loma is just in a different league, even if he's not doing much of anything either. Loma is picking up his punch rate, landing some quick taps that eventually will get harder and harder. Big three-punch combo from Loma with 30 seconds left. Huuuuge right to Crolla's body 10 seconds later. Forbes scores it for Loma.
Overall: Loma 20-18
First round: The crowd is doing the ""Seven Nation Army"" chant as the first round begins, in honor of Loma. Nothing much happens in the first minute, but Loma lands a body shot. He's not doing much, but he's still pressuring Crolla and making life uncomfortable. Crolla throws two shots to the body. Right hook to the body and comes back up to Crolla's head for Loma. He ends the round with a right to Crolla's head. Forbes scores it for Loma.
Overall: Loma 10-9
Lomachenko ring walk: Lomachenko isn't smiling as he enters the ring. He pumps his fist twice, and he begins his walk. He bangs his gloves together and gives a little scream. He's also on a hurry on his way to the ring. He's ready to get going.
Crolla ring walk: He's walking with a bit of a swagger as he enters the arena. He raises his hands in triumph, and it sounds like the crowd showers him with some tepid boos. Crolla is smiling en route to the ring. He looks pretty confident."
Netflix CEO Reed Hastings To Leave Facebook Board In May,www.forbes.com,Jonathan Berr,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanberr/2019/04/12/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-to-leave-facebook-board-in-may/,"Facebook announced late Friday that Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings is leaving the company’s board of directors in May as competition between the tech giants heats up. Hastings, 58, cut ties with the world’s largest social network after 8 years on its board because of Facebook’s growing interest in video business models which created a conflict for him as the CEO of Netflix, according to a person familiar with the situation. A statement from Facebook indicated that Hastings and another board member former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowels won't “not be nominated for re-election at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.”
With its user growth slowing, Facebook reportedly is spending billions on developing original entertainment, sports and news video content with the goal of turning its Facebook Watch video platform into a TV-like experience that would siphon off some of the ad dollars being spent on broadcast and cable networks.
Netflix is in a similar predicament. Walt Disney announced yesterday that its Disney + subscription video on demand service will launch in March and would cost $6.99 per month, about half the price of the Standard Netflix plan, which runs $13 a month. AT&T’s WarnerMedia also is planning to launch a streaming service later this year.
In other news, Facebook announced that PayPal Senior Vice President Peggy Alford was nominated to the company’s board for election at the company’s May 30 annual meeting. Alford was known to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg through her as an executive at his philanthropic organization Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
""Peggy is one of those rare people who's an expert across many different areas — from business management to nance operations to product development,"" Zuckerberg said in a press release. ""I know she will have great ideas that help us address both the opportunities and challenges facing our company.""
Officials from Menlo Park, Calif.-based Facebook couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. A spokesperson for Netflix declined to comment.
The other members of the Facebook Board are Zuckerberg; Venture Capitalist Marc L. Andreessen’; former American Express CEO Kenneth I. Chennault; Susan D. Desmond-Hellmann, CEO, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Facebook Chief Operating Officer; Peter A. Thiel of the Founders Fund and Jeffrey D. Zients, CEO, the Cranemere Group.

BTS Have Just Become The First K-Pop Act To Hit Five Billion Plays On Spotify,www.forbes.com,Hugh McIntyre,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/04/12/bts-have-just-become-the-first-k-pop-act-to-hit-five-billion-plays-on-spotify/,"BTS may be focusing all their attention on their new album Map of the Soul: Persona , which was just released earlier today (Friday, April 12), but the band has yet another reason to celebrate. The group’s music has now been streamed five billion times on Spotify (according to a report published by Hits Daily Double , which confirmed the figure with the Swedish streaming giant), and they now stand alone in their genre. BTS is the only K-pop act to reach that milestone, proving once again that they are truly in a league of their own, even when it comes to other Korean artists.
BTS benefits from not only unprecedented popularity all around the world, but also a sizable back catalog, both of which helped them rack up the billions of streams. The male vocal group currently has 17 albums listed on Spotify, as well as nine EPs and several standalone singles. All that music makes it easier for them to see their career total play count rise, though five billion streams is still a staggering sum, even for some of the biggest names in the business.
While five billion streams is certainly noteworthy (especially when a group becomes the first in any style of music to do so), but BTS still has a long way to go before they’re even close to being the most-streamed musical act on Spotify. In 2018 alone, Drake, the platform’s most-played artist in the world, saw his music collect 8.2 billion streams. By now, his career total is well into eleven digits, and it shows no sign of slowing down.
Five billion is an astounding number, but it’s important to remember that the figure only represents activity on Spotify. Their videos have also been played billions of times on YouTube, and their music has earned several billion more streams across other sites like Apple Music, Napster, Deezer, and dozens of others.
With a new album headed toward the top of the charts in countries all around the world (and probably more music already in the works), it’s only a matter of time before BTS reaches six billion plays, and then seven, and then eight...

"Apple Loop: New iPhone Leaks, iPod Touch Coming Soon, Replacing The Fragile MacBook Pro",www.forbes.com,Ewan Spence,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/04/12/apple-news-iphone-pro-iphone-11-leak-rumor-ipod-touch-macbook-pro-keyboard-problems/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Consumer Tech Storyteller exploring digital worlds, mobile, music and podcasting Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin Taking a look back at another week of news and headlines from Cupertino, this week’s Apple Loop includes the new iPhone Pro design and specification leaks, the iPhone’s difficult future, an important NFC update for developers, thoughts on the upcoming MacBook Pro and Apple's fragile keyboard problems, why the iPod Touch is still coming soon, and the secrets behind the Apple Card’s stylish look.
Apple Loop is here to remind you of a few of the very many discussions that have happened around Apple over the last seven days ( and you can read my weekly digest of Android news here on Forbes ).
Is Apple Ready To Launch The iPhone Pro?
The iPad has the iPad Pro. The MacBook has the MacBook Pro. The iPhone has… Exactly. For many years the idea of a ‘Pro’ iPhone has been lurking. Will 2019 be the year that the portfolio proliferates to a more advanced iPhone with more features and presumably a price premium to match? Forbes’ Gordon Kelly reports :
Alongside the expected iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR updates, Mac Otakara says Apple is preparing additional 6.1-inch and 6.5-inch models with OLED displays, thinner chassis, similar triple array cameras but with larger sensors, reverse wireless charging and bundled 18W Lightning-to-USB-C fast chargers.
Mac Otakara previously stated the new XS, XS Max and XR updates will ship with slow chargers and identical chassis while the XR will retain its cheaper LCD display. All of which indicates the introduction of a new flagship iPhone tier above the XSes - potentially the long expected ‘iPhone Pro’ range.

The Difficult iPhone Path For The Future
Let’s not forget that the 2019 iPhones - no matter how many are in the portfolio - have a tough task ahead of them. Credit Suisse’s Matt Cabral has laid out the challenge . Yun Li looks at the note issued to investors :
It expects iPhone sales to decline 12.4% in 2019 after dropping 3.2% in 2018. “iPhone is in a difficult spot with units >20% below peak as users are holding on to their devices longer than ever (4 years per CSe) and price hikes have likely run their course.
""…Beyond macro conditions, we see deeper structural challenges in China and do not expect a meaningful turnaround without a major iPhone refresh, which is unlikely until 5G in CY20,” said Cabral, the investment bank’s director of equity research.

iPhone Will Update NFC Access
Apple appears set to open up NFC options to third-party developers. The leak comes from the UK Government and Home Secretary Sajid Javid as he talks up the release of the ‘EU Exit: ID Document Check’ app. This was only available for Android last year as the iPhone could not read a passport’s NFC chip. That’s changing, as I reported earlier this week :
When the app was first launched, this feature was available on Android, but Apple’s developer restrictions meant that it was impossible for third-party developers to use the iPhone’s NFC circuitry to perform the same task. That meant the app only launched for Android.
For Javid to make the statement above, Apple must have changed the policy around NFC access. It’s unlikely that this will be a unique feature for the UK government, so developers can prepare to roll out NFC functionality from Android apps to the iOS-powered iPhone.
More here on Forbes .
More Details On The New MacBook Pro
Following reports earlier in the week that Apple was delaying new MacBook machines, further reports noted that while the MacBook machines with new screen technology were slipping to 2021, there may be an update to the range in 2019 to address the numerous hardware problems. Chaim Gartenberg reports :
Kuo’s original 2019 date seemed early given that Apple’s current MacBook Pro design is barely three years old. But the current design has suffered from a fair amount of criticism, including design flaws in the keyboard (which Apple still seems to be struggling with, despite its attempts to fix it last year) as well as issues with display cables dying (dubbed “Flexgate”). And while a 2021 update for the rumored 2019 laptop seems early, it’s easy to imagine that Apple might have fast-tracked new MacBook Pro hardware ahead of its normal update cycles to in order to put those issues behind it, and then follow that up with the mini-LED version later on once that tech is perfected.
More at The Verge .
Maybe The iPod Touch Is ‘Still Coming’?
It was partly expected in March’s smorgasbord of product launches, but an update to the iPod Touch remains tantalizingly out of reach. Zac Hall looks at the options for the portable media player:
So if the iPod touch isn’t dead, it’s just sticking around in the product lineup until a let’s-face-it-slightly-spec-bumped version is ready, when might the iPod touch 7 show up?
Historically, iPods were September products, shown off alongside new versions of iTunes, save for the fifth-gen touch that appeared in October. The current iPod touch made a surprise appearance in the dead center of July.
For future iPod touch customers, that’s the grain of hope. Apple can release new hardware anytime it wants, and that sometimes means the middle of July like last year’s MacBook Pro revisions — or anytime in the year for that matter.

And Finally…
Apple still likes to push a corporate message of being ‘masters of design’ and while that may be in question given the iPhone changes, the Apple Card gives them a new canvas to work with. In typical fashion, Apple has spent time on designing a creative void. Arun Venkatesan looks at the choices made.
If the manufacturing process shown in the keynote is similar to what will be used for the final product, Apple’s card will also be created in a way completely new to credit cards. Most commonly available “metal” credit cards are a stamped piece of metal or a slim piece of metal laminated between two pieces of plastic onto which the EMV chip, numbers and markings are applied.
Apple’s video shows a card blank being cut from a single sheet of titanium. Then, a CNC mill cuts out a space for the EMV chip to be inserted in a later step."
"Android Circuit: Latest Galaxy Note 10 Leak, Samsung Launches S10 Rival, New OnePlus 7 Mystery",www.forbes.com,Ewan Spence,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/04/12/android-news-galaxy-note-10-5g-specifications-budget-phablet-oneplus-7-pro-pixel4-pixel4xl-nokia9/,"Taking a look back at seven days of news and headlines across the world of Android, this week’s Android Circuit includes Samsung’s rival to its Galaxy S10, four new Galaxy Note 10 models leak, a third OnePlus 7, some thoughts on multi-lens cameras, more details on the Pixel 4 and 4XL, and finding all the curated classic music you need. Android Circuit is here to remind you of a few of the many things that have happened around Android in the last week ( and you can find the weekly Apple news digest here ).
Samsung Launches Rival To Galaxy S10
While those looking at the flagship ranges are getting to grips with the Galaxy S10, Samsung’s mid-range Galaxy A80 has arrived . With a notchless screen, a rotating camera, and Samsung’s Bixby assistant, it’s as cutting edge as the S10 family in regards features. Forbes’ Gordon Kelly takes a closer look:
The Galaxy A80 is Samsung’s first phone to feature its ‘New Infinity’ display: a 6.7-inch, notch-less, cut-out free, FHD+ Super AMOLED screen with an integrated fingerprint sensor and bezels so small the A80 has a screen-to-body ratio of almost 100%. It’s the holy grail of smartphone design.
It’s also a design with a superb party trick. The A80’s rear cameras are housed in a sliding, rotating mechanism which automatically flips when you take a selfie which removes the need for a dedicated front-facing camera. And the cameras themselves? A new triple camera array comprising a 48MP primary shooter, ultra-wide lens and ToF sensor - a feature previously limited to the $1,300 Galaxy S10 5G - so you’re getting better selfies as well.

Expect Four Galaxy Note 10 Models To Be Launced
More details on the Galaxy Note 10 range is coming out, and the surprising word has to be range. Previously the Note range has been a single product SKU - with the occasional exception such as the Note 4/ Note Edge combo in 2014 - but not this year ( reports ET news ). Stand by for four Galaxy Note 10 handsets :
The base Galaxy Note 10 model is expected to support a larger 6.75 inch display, but there will also be a ‘budget’ model (that echoes the Galaxy S10e model) which will retain the Note 9 format with a 6.25 inch screen. Both of these will ship with 4G LTE connectivity.
Given the enterprise focus of the Note, and the benefits of 5G, Samsung is expected to launch a 5G version of the Note 10. But the latest news suggests that the two Note 10 models (the Note 10 and presumptively named Note 10e) will both be available in 4G LTE and 5G variantsThe base Galaxy Note 10 model is expected to support a larger 6.75 inch display, but there will also be a ‘budget’ model (that echoes the Galaxy S10e model) which will retain the Note 9 format with a 6.25 inch screen. Both of these will ship with 4G LTE connectivity.
But as Gordon Kelly points out, the ‘Pro’ model has a physical issue :
Samsung has decided that if you want the best tech it has to offer then you’ll need to buy a smartphone with a display just 0.25-inches smaller than its Galaxy Tab 7 tablet. It’s a woeful backwards step, at exactly the wrong time.
More on that issue here .

Getty And There’s Another OnePlus 7 As Well
This week threw up a mystery of a third OnePlus handset. Both the presumptively named OnePlus 7 and the OnePlus 7 5G have been tacitly confirmed by the company, but what about a larger screened ‘Pro’ version? Tech Radar’s Siddharth Chauhan and James Peckham :
The phone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset and the variant in the picture has 8GB of RAM and 256GB storage. The Snapdragon 855 also gives the phone 5G capabilities thanks to Qualcomm's X50 modem.
…According to the picture, the OnePlus 7 Pro will have three cameras consisting of 48MP, 16MP and 8MP sensors. There is no information about the selfie camera, but it is rumored that the upcoming OnePlus phone may have a pop-up camera for selfies.
Of course this could be the 5G handset, with the more traditional looking handset the OnePlus 7 we all expect. But why would OnePlus have three sets of serial numbers for two handsets certified?
As with all leaks, there’s no confirmation that this is the real deal. It is a change in OnePlus’ business model of a single handset release every six months, but that’s already changing with the upcoming 5G model - and recent bluetooth certification did list three OnePlus models.
A mystery indeed.
Where To Put All These Lenses?
Now that the smartphone ecosystem has moved on from ‘how many cameras should your phone have’ (the answer is one more than is practically, especially if you listen to the Nokia 9 PureView team ), how should you organise all the lenses? In a line? Vertical? Horizontal? Like a star? Ronald Comstock looks at the options :
Device makers sought to accommodate all the three cameras in a more symmetrical fashion, making the horizontal placement method very popular. We see this on popular flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S10+ (which shared the same placement setup with different number of cameras across its siblings) and the LG V40 ThinQ. On the other hand, the vertical placement setup also saw its takers in the form of the Sony Xperia 1, and the offset continued on with devices like the Xiaomi Mi 9, the Huawei P30 Pro, the Honor Magic 2 and many more.

Discovering The Pixel 4 And Pixel 4 XL
Following last week’s spot of the Google Pixel 4, more details are coming out of this year’s updated handset from Mountain View. Or at least the code-names. Kyle Bradshaw goes hunting :
This afternoon, a commit was posted to the Android Open Source Project, attempting to fix a labeling issue with Android’s SELinux policy. For our purposes, we just need to know that SELinux is a security module for the Linux kernel, which is often fine-tuned on a per-device basis.
In the comments, the developer tries to explain the issue they’re attempting to fix by giving a list of internal files that are showing an error…
In a turn that none of us expected, the Google app code plainly tells us that the codename “Coral” is used for the “Pixel 4.” It also reveals that an unusual third codename, “Flame,” is used for the “Pixel 4 XL.”

And Finally…
In a musical world with everything at your fingertips, is there value in a service that is specifically targeted at a genre? Primephonic believes so, and the latest update to its classical music streaming adds the ability to download not just your own playlists but curated lists as well.
Other generic streaming services, that predominately cater to pop music, just aren’t designed to cope with the additional metadata needed to organise parameters such as composer, name of the work, opus number, key, orchestra, conductor, soloist and choir. A team of classical music experts have been manually inputting this data to ensure the optimum user and search experience for subscribers.

Will Women Make History at Warren Buffett's 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Weekend?,www.forbes.com,Laura Rittenhouse,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurarittenhouse/2019/04/12/will-women-make-history-at-warren-buffetts-2019-berkshire-hathaway-weekend/,"At last year’s Berkshire Hathaway meeting in Omaha, three women met and wondered out loud why female investors were so underrepresented in the conferences and meetings of one of the premier investing events of the year. But it wasn’t just in Omaha that female investors were missing at the table. At a time when women are making substantive progress in many fields, two statistics underscore the problems faced by female-owned investment companies. First reported in a landmark study by the Knight Foundation “ Ownership Diversity in the Asset Management Industry ” these are:
Among all investment companies operating in the U.S, only about three percent are owned by women. The total value of Assets Under Management (AUM) controlled by female investors, represents only one percent of all U.S. investment company AUM . So Kim Shannon, the founder and CEO of Sionna Investment Management, LJ Rittenhouse, Berkshire author, financial analyst and inventor of Candor Analytics TM and Barbara Ann Bernard, the founder and CEO of Wincrest Capital, decided to do something.
Kim Shannon, LJ Rittenhouse, Barbara Ann Bernard
©2019 Rittenhouse Rankings To raise awareness about the gender bias gap in the investment sector – possibly one of the biggest (and most ignored) gaps in business – we would host a conference in Omaha around the 2019 Berkshire Hathaway meeting weekend and explain why this gap persists. We would present the case for growing AUFM: Assets Under Female Management.
Why are female-owned investment funds so underfunded both in numbers and in investable capital? Is it because female investors underperform male investors? A vast body of research dispels this myth.
In 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that among the 50 largest U.S. hedge funds, only two were run by female executives . And yet, this same report confirmed that the 2017 year-end returns generated by female-owned hedge funds were the same or superior to male-owned hedge funds.
Last May, we thought this conference was an audacious idea. Today it appears that conversations about gender bias in investing are reaching a tipping point. Here are recent landmark studies:
In December, Morgan Stanley published an in-depth study led by Carla Harris, Vice Chair of Wealth Management on The Growing Market Investors Are Missing – The trillion-dollar case for investing in female and multicultural entrepreneurs .
These researchers evaluated how firms led by women and people of color are consistently underfunded. They wondered if it is because most asset allocators and investors are white men who “are twice as likely to think that female and minority-owned businesses perform below the market average compared to non-minority, male-owned businesses.”
Carla Harris. Photographer: Andrew Harrer.
BLOOMBERG NEWS But this underfunding perception did not hold up. In fact, the researchers found that not only did returns generated by multicultural-owned investment firms match market returns, but also that female-owned investment firms produced returns that beat the market by 2 percent annually.
These findings are supported in a May 2018 report by the Boston Consulting Group “ Why Women-Owned Startups Are a Better Bet. ”
Here, researchers found that women-led startups generated more than two times the amount of revenue per dollar invested than did comparable male-owned startups. And yet – even with results such as these – they found that female-owned early stage start-ups received, on average, $1 million less than a comparable male-owned start-up.
What can CEOs, boards of directors and investors do to promote more diversity, accountability, and also generate superior results? How and where are we seeing change today?
The Knight Foundation once again is leading the way. Since 2010, the Foundation has increased its holdings in female and diverse asset management funds to over 20 percent of their current total endowment.
Another initiative that is changing minds and practices is the Canadian Gender and Good Governance Alliance. It is a partnership of leading non-profit organizations that represent over $4 trillion in assets, 5 million employees, 200 CEOs, 13,500 board directors, and, also government representatives and regulators.
In 2017, the Alliance published a ground-breaking document: The CEO Blueprint: How to Build and Lead Gender-balanced Organizations . The report recommends that boards work with management 1) to integrate the gender initiative with the business strategy; 2) to set targets and regularly remeasure progress; and 3) to build awareness throughout the organization and tie compensation to goal achievement.
Why does gender balance matter? The research is clear: we invest in people we trust, and most often the people we trust are those who look and think like us. If we want to support women-owned businesses, we need more female investors and female-owned investment companies.
The challenge to grow female-owned investment firms was evident in February when I attended the Columbia Business School’s prestigious two-day Value Investment conference. When moderator Jason Zweig asked the women in the audience to stand up, it appeared that among the 400 or so attendees, only a few dozen were women. Then Zweig asked these women if they intended to make investing their career. Only a few raised their hands.
How can this change? At our conference next month in Omaha, we will network, discuss and recommend strategies to boost AUFM.

Egypt won 2-1. Photo: Islam Safwat/NurPhoto via Getty Images Getty Egypt are in Group A, which is the toughest based on FIFA rankings. They will face the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda and Zimbabwe in the group stage, and even if they win their group, they could end up with a tricky match against South Africa in the last 16.
As the hosts of the tournament, and the finalists of the 2017 African Cup of Nations, Egypt are probably the favorites going into this year’s tournament. They’ve been champions of Africa more times than any other nation, have lost only twice in their last 25 home games against African opponents, and of course, they have Mohamed Salah.
Group A might be the toughest according to FIFA rankings, but Group D is being called the ‘group of death’. The group, containing Morocco, Ivory Coast, South Africa and Namibia, is the toughest according to ELO rankings, which are often considered more accurate than FIFA’s system.
Morocco last won the African Cup of Nations back in 1976, but coach Herve Renard has got them looking very impressive. Renard is the only coach to win AFCON with two different countries: Zambia in 2012 and Ivory Coast in 2015. His Morocco side haven’t lost to African opposition since June 2017 and put on some strong performances at the 2018 World Cup, where they were also in the so-called ‘group of death’.
Egypt’s hot summer weather could hurt Morocco’s chances though. The 2019 African Cup of Nations has been switched to the summer, kicking off on June 21, and the heat in Egypt at that time of year goes beyond uncomfortable. Morocco play a high-intensity game, covering more distance at speeds of over 20 and 25 kilometers per hour than anyone else in the 2018 World Cup group stages, but the Egyptian heat could have an effect on their style of play.
Their Group D opponents Ivory Coast are full of Premier League stars like Manchester United’s Eric Bailly, Tottenham Hotspur’s Serge Aurier and Crystal Palace main man Wilfried Zaha. Just getting out of Group D alive might not be enough. Finishing second in Group D could lead to a last 16 match-up against Tunisia, Africa’s second best-ranked side. Finishing as one of the best third-placed teams could lead to a last-16 match against Nigeria or Egypt.
Nigeria on the other hand, have been handed a comparatively easy group, facing Guinea and AFCON first timers Madagascar and Burundi, although their last 16 match could potentially be against a side from Group D. The Super Eagles are unbeaten since the 2018 World Cup and have strength in all positions, especially in midfield where they can call on Arsenal’s Alex Iwobi and Leicester City’s Wilfred Ndidi.
Holders Cameroon were originally supposed to host this tournament, but were stripped of hosting rights. Head coach Clarence Seedorf has had a tough start to his spell in charge, only winning two of his six games so far. Cameroon’s toughest opponents in Group F are Ghana, but even if they finish second in the group, they should avoid the bigger teams in the round of 16.
Liverpool’s Sadio Mane and Manchester City’s Riyad Mahrez are locked in a Premier League title race at the moment but could also face each other in Group C where Senegal and Algeria are the favorites to progress. Senegal missed out on the World Cup knockout stages by the slimmest of margins, but have never won the African Cup of Nations.
In Group E, Tunisia have been handed a kind draw. But if they top their group containing Mali, Mauritania and Angola, they will face the runners up of Group D in the round of 16.
The 2019 African Cup of Nations opens with Egypt against Zimbabwe on the 21 st of June.

A Look At How The Mandarin Oriental Munich Is Redefining German Luxury,www.forbes.com,Bridget Arsenault,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bridgetarsenault/2019/04/12/a-look-at-how-the-mandarin-oriental-munich-is-redefining-german-luxury/,"The Mandarin Oriental Munich Courtesy of Mandarin Oriental Dating back to 1880, this property only became a Mandarin Oriental Group Hotel in 2000. Originally the city's ballroom, this locale has always held court in the city of Munich. Its convenient location puts the hotel in the midst of the old town and only a 30-minute drive from Munich International airport. It's also in an ideal spot for walking or cycling across the city. The 19th-century Neo-Renaissance stucco architecture is spectacular, with its wedding-cake-like design; this palatial property offers beckoning views from every angle. Take in the city's mysterious megalithic monuments from every vantage. And from the moment you walk through the fairytale doors nothing is overlooked or too much trouble. The team has the answer to everything from arranging city tours, to obscure phone chargers, train tickets to dealing with flight cancellations - nothing seems to phase them and every guest is always made to feel entirely at home. A junior suite at the Mandarin Oriental Courtesy of Mandarin Oriental
Once inside, the aesthetic throughout is classic and refined. It's also the type of place where you might spot a famous face stepping down the central staircase or at ease in the hotel bar. There's a hint of Art deco-style within the upholstered furniture, and the interiors reference both Munich’s vernacular style and also that of the Far East, such as the temple lions that can be spotted throughout the building, as to be expected of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel group. The bar at Matsuhisa sushi Courtesy of Mandarin Oriental
The hotel has 73 spacious rooms and suites (they are in the process of expanding the property and adding new rooms, as well as a new state-of-the art spa within the next few years). Top floor rooms come with extra-special views of the nearby Hofbräuhaus beer gardens and the patterned red rooftops of nearby historic buildings. Generously sized and well-laid-out, the rooms feature high ceilings, heated floors, and clever open-plan designs. Created in a Neo-Biedermeier style paired with Asian design elements, these interiors are made for the modern traveller. The bedside tables, for instance, feature a drawer with the master controls, managing all of the lighting, and the room service is accessible via a simple tap of an iPad. Tech is integral, even down to the bathrooms, which feature a Bang & Olufsen TV, not dissimilar to the large one in each bedroom. The sushi counter at Matsuhisa Courtesy of Mandarin Oriental
Matsuhisa Munich (led by the renowned chef Nobuyuki Matsuhisa of Nobu fame) serves Peruvian and Japanese cuisine. The menu is inventive, showcasing a host of unexpected flavour combinations and ingredients, as well as a selection of the tried-and-tested favourites - including the famous black cod. Courtesy of the low lighting and soft hues of brown and gold throughout, this space moves seamlessly from day to after dark. Typically buzzing at breakfast, lunch and evening, the clever design - the well-spaced tables and more private inlets, insure a maximum number of diners can enjoy the restaurant and even during peak periods, there's a sense of calm and privacy throughout.
This spacious, well-appointed spot is also where the extensive breakfast spread is served. There is a buffet offering several types of pastries, continental meats and cheeses, olives, cereals, a kaleidoscope of fresh fruit (the more exotic, the better), a range of milks, plus an a la carte selection of hot dishes. You name it, and they serve it. Don't skimp on breakfast, it practically negates the need to eat for the rest of the day. And here, they do sweet as well as they do savory, so don't forget to make your way to the lobby bar each day for the sitting of traditional British afternoon tea.
On the ground floor, Ory bar is a new design and concept for the hotel. It's an approachable space punctuated with clever elements, like the complimentary welcome drinks for all guests, handed out the moment each person walks through the main entrance (so a guest never has to be empty handed while waiting for their plus one to arrive). With its irridescent orange-gold bar and jewel-coloured velvet and leather chairs, every corner of this destination bar beckons. The balcony from the Presidential Suite Courtesy of Mandarin Oriental
The rooftop pool is open during the warm summer months and enjoys the best view of Munich and the Alps of anywhere in the city. This hidden enclave is an enigma in Munich, a city with surprisingly few rooftop offerings, and these sensational 360-degree views are not to be missed. Every visit to the hotel ought to include a mandatory leisurely dip in the pool or a few hours at least supine with a book on a neighbouring deck chair. Ory Bar Vadim Kretschmer
The overarching elegance is evident from the moment you walk into the lobby, and the Mandarin Oriental Munich has long been renowned among both travellers and locals, as a luxury haven of ease and respite. Considering the distinctive Ory bar and exceptional restaurant offerings, one would be forgiven for overlooking the charms of Munich altogether and simply enjoying the comforts of this hotel.

8 Things Every Entrepreneur Should Know About Outsourcing,www.forbes.com,The Oracles,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesleadershipcollective/2019/03/05/eight-things-every-entrepreneur-should-know-about-outsourcing/,"9 Ways to Conquer Fear and Realize Your True Potential - March 15, 2019
Outsourcing can save a lot of time and money, but hiring outside experts for the wrong tasks can also negatively impact your business. Here’s how eight business leaders and advisors in The Oracles decide what to outsource and what to keep in-house. (Image courtesy of The Oracles) Consider how your needs will evolve
By outsourcing, entrepreneurs can operate in ways that used to be reserved for much larger companies. When we first opened Drybar, we outsourced all our accounting, bookkeeping and payroll, which saved us time and money. As a result, we appeared (and were) more buttoned-up than we could’ve been on our own. When we became large enough, we took that work back in-house.
We used to outsource our towel services, too. While we now handle that in-house, it was much more cost-effective and practical to outsource in the beginning. The point is, what makes sense for you now may change as you grow and evolve.
— Alli Webb, founder of Drybar , co-founder of Squeeze , co-host of “ Raising the Bar ,” author of “ The Drybar Guide to Good Hair for All ” and guest Shark on “ Shark Tank ”; follow Alli on Instagram Keep your team small and efficient
Focus on what you do best and outsource the rest. Unless you are a big company, you don’t need a full-time accountant. Use sites like Upwork to find web developers, HelpGrid for customer support and MaxWeb to drive traffic to your website. By using outside experts, you save time, pay only for results and reduce the noise. Besides, it’s easier to replace a service provider than to train and manage people.
If I’m not sure whether to outsource a task, I ask myself three questions: Is this what we want to be known for? Can we do this better, faster or cheaper than an outside expert? Will outsourcing negatively impact our customer experience? If the answer is no to all three, we outsource so we can focus on what we do best.
— Mike Peters , problem solver, entrepreneur and philanthropist; generated more than $1 billion in sales online; founder and CEO of the Yomali group of companies; XPRIZE Vision Circle board member Related: The Job Most Entrepreneurs Don’t Think to Outsource Don’t outsource your core skill set
Never outsource whatever defines your company’s core skill set. That might be sales and marketing, manufacturing, finance, or tech support.
It’s tempting to see outsourcing as a way to streamline operations and reduce costs, but you cannot put a price on your core business. Keep it in-house, fine-tune it, master it and be the best at it. That will pay you back in more ways than any cost savings.
— Scott Shainman, president of Getac North America , who helped lead the company to become one of the world’s largest rugged laptop and tablet manufacturers; connect with Scott on LinkedIn and Instagram Mitigate your risks
Look at the risk associated with the task. Outsourcing things like compliance, cybersecurity, accounting and complex systems can mitigate your risk. While extremely important, these areas can detract from your ability to grow and optimize your core services. If you don’t view yourself as an expert in something, find a service provider that can give you confidence your critical systems are compliant and robust.
We manage our analyst work, document tracking software, CRM, data mining, design and development because they are our core services. We outsource tasks like opening investors’ retirement accounts because we aren’t familiar with the regulations and operational procedures.
— Thomas Carter , founder and CEO of DealBox ; read about Thomas: “ This FinTech Veteran Is Making Cryptocurrency Startup Funding Legitimate ”; c onnect with Thomas on LinkedIn and Instagram Don’t outsource relationships
Jeff Bezos is famous for asking what will be the same 10 years from now rather than asking what technology will change. It’s a great reframe, and I believe that being able to develop real, genuine relationships is more valuable than ever because of technology and outsourcing.
Besides payroll, printing and some tasks that can be done virtually, we don’t outsource much. Each team member works only in their specialty. We will never outsource marketing, messaging and sales because that’s where we create value. We are paid for our creativity and ability to develop relationships.
— Peter Von Der Ahe , leader of the New York Multifamily team at Marcus & Millichap, with $1 billion annual sales, and host of “ Behind the Bricks ,” the No. 1 NYC multifamily investing podcast Keep it in-house if it saves money
My rule is simple: Keep it in-house if it is a core competency or you can save money doing it yourself. Otherwise, outsource it.
We outsource payroll, accounting, taxes, printing and legal tasks. We keep marketing and training in-house because they are the two biggest areas where we have a sustainable competitive advantage. Most real estate companies outsource photography and sign installation, but because of our volume we can save money and provide better service by doing it ourselves. Don’t reinvent the wheel
Initially, we tried to build what we needed ourselves — including our own CMS, mailing service and app analytics. But as MacPaw grew, those tasks became a burden. I learned it’s important and economically feasible to outsource jobs that don’t represent the core of your business.
Identify what makes you outstanding and why your customers choose to buy from you. This is where your main focus and resources should be. Plenty of companies specialize in solving your other problems.
— Oleksandr Kosovan, founder and CEO of Setapp and MacPaw , whose flagship app CleanMyMac has exceeded 5 million users; co-founder and partner at SMRK VC Fund; connect with Oleksandr on LinkedIn Outsource if someone else does it better
Effective scaling means leaning into what you are good at and enjoy — and what moves the needle forward. It also means handing off anything someone else can do faster and better. You can build a strong outsourced team with lower overheads than if you hired everyone yourself. You just need a savvy approach and effective systems, metrics, and reporting around hiring and managing talent.
Because we began as a location-independent team, outsourcing wasn’t optional. While I mastered many skills in the beginning, our growth required that we outsource almost everything quickly. We’ve adopted project management software and outsourced sales, design, web builds, ad campaigns and community management. We keep vision, strategy and creative writing in-house.

"Mass Firings Will Challenge Hollywood Dealmaking As Writers, Agents Split",www.forbes.com,Jill Goldsmith,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgoldsmith/2019/04/12/mass-firings-will-challenge-hollywood-dealmaking-as-writers-agents-split/,"ATA chief Karen Stuart said the failure of negotiations “was driven by the Guild’s predetermined course for chaos.”
“The WGA leadership today declared a pathway for compromise doesn’t exist,” she said. “Agencies have been committed to reaching an agreement with the WGA. We came to the negotiating table in good faith and put forth comprehensive proposals providing choice, disclosure, transparency, shared revenue and a significant investment in inclusion programs. Unfortunately, not to our surprise, the WGA did not accept our offer, did not provide counterproposals and refused to negotiate further. We’re prepared to continue to fight for the best interests of writers and all artists.”
She said agreeing to the WGA’s new Code of Conduct would “hurt all artists, delivering an especially painful blow to mid-level and emerging writers, while dictating how agencies of all sizes should function.”
The Guild will now require all its members to fire agents who do not sign the Code by midnight Friday. It posted a prepared a termination letter for writers to sign electronically and plans to deliver the letters to agencies en masse. It also posted a list of 50 smaller agencies that have agreed to sign the Code and a link to a new, electronic job board. The WGA insists that it is legally allowed to deputize managers and attorneys to step in for agents but the ATA says that would contradict California and New York State Law and threatened earlier today to sue anyone who tries it.
The ATA’s proposal offered writers an 0.8% piece of backend fees agencies receive from studios for packaged projects, Goodman said, calling that too little too late. It “in no way realigns your incentives with these writers. You are still receiving money from our employers for access to us, and keeping 99% of the profits of your backend. … It is not a serious proposal and we reject it.”
On production, agencies offered to be more transparent about deals and agreed to renegotiate again in two years. Also nixed.
Goodman said the two sides only came sort-of close on one issue, how to compensate writers of independent features.
WME, CAA, UTA and ICM Partners do nearly all the packaging of TV shows and much of the financing and sales servicing of independent films. These big four, along with more than 100 others agencies have refused to sign the Code of Conduct. Of the agencies that have signed, only one, Pantheon, is an ATA member that has broken ranks, according to Deadline Hollywood.
Goodman has acknowledged that a break will be disruptive but believes that it's the only way to face down what he sees as growing inequities in the agent-writer relationship. WGA members voted nearly unanimously in late March to approve the changes in the new Code of Conduct and to support union leadership in negotiations, whatever the outcome."
Dillon Francis Looks To Diversifying His Business Endeavors With Help From His Buddy Gerald,www.forbes.com,Rosy Cordero,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rosycordero/2019/04/12/dillon-francis-looks-to-diversifying-his-business-endeavors-with-help-from-his-buddy-gerald/,"Dillon Francis shares a wide grin as he talks about the multiple projects he’s working on for 2019, with many that extend beyond music. Fans can thank the native west coaster’s sidekick and mascot Gerald the Piñata for inspiring him in ways he never imagined, as Francis prepares to drop a second round of limited edition merchandise featuring Gerald and friends by Dillon Francis x Barney Cools, set to debut at the end of April. The limited edition 17-piece capsule collection is an extension of the original line launched at ComplexCon Long Beach in 2018. Items will include embroidered t-shirts, denim jackets and corduroy hats, as well as color blocked hoodies, socks and the perfect summer sunnies that will allow shoppers to view the world through Gerald’s eyes.
Someone gave me a piñata but I didn’t really think anything of it at the time,” Francis said from his Los Angeles home. “One day, I was looking into my fridge and I saw the colorful thing in the corner so I grabbed my phone and started recording it on Snapchat. I decided Gerald would be his name as I started yelling at him randomly, ‘Gerald, aren’t you happy?’ After that, it took on a life of its own.
Since then, he’s inspired me to create more videos on social media including some of his adventures that have led him into trouble like when where he ordered a mail order mermaid and another time he partied until the early morning hours. Fans loved it and started to bring piñatas that looked like him to my shows as totems. So I thought it would be a great idea to make some Gerald-themed merchandise. The first collection went really well which inspired me to create a follow-up.”
At home with Dillon Francis
Photo: Rosy Cordero Francis looking ahead to making his fourth appearance at the yearly Indio festival, and his first as a headliner. Francis promises he’ll bring something different that’s never been seen before, which is a difficult feat.
With a residency at The Wynn in Las Vegas and tour dates all over the world, it can get challenging to create something unique for each date, but he knows how important it is to keep things fresh for crowds that just want to party.
I have put in asks with different managers for talent that will be at the festival,” he explained. “They haven’t committed yet but I'm definitely working on some surprises. No matter what, I’m happy to support some of the artists that will be there that I admire like J Balvin, Bad Bunny and Rosalia.
Vegas is a totally different set than going to a festival or going to a tour show because I play for like two hours and I get to play everything. I really like playing Vegas because I really get to do my own thing there. I consistently work to ensure that I’m giving the fans a unique experience each time. Even I get bored if I’m constantly doing the same thing over and over again. So it really keeps me on my toes.”
Francis claims he gets enough sleep daily, even though it’s easy to see his mind is constantly on and thinking of ways to put smiles on the faces of strangers. He recently released an original comedy series titled, “Like and Subscribe” available on Funny or Die and Amazon Video where viewers follow four influencers who are locked in a house by their manager Skyy Goldwynne (Francis) with a camera crew.

Francis may not have known exactly what he wanted to do when he grew up during his years attending the East Los Angeles arts school Lachsa High School, but he’s elated with the way everything turned out.
I listen to Dave Asprey’s podcast where he asks successful people about achieving success,” he said. “Most say that their secret is having fun and helping people. From hearing that, I feel like I’ve been going in the right direction.
Every day that I wake up, I want to be creating something that I love or making people laugh. It makes me feel really good.”"
The HBO NOW App 7-Day Free Trial Is Best Way To Stream Game Of Thrones Premiere,www.forbes.com,TJ McCue,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2019/04/12/the-hbo-now-app-7-day-free-trial-is-best-way-to-stream-game-of-thrones-premiere/,"As Game of Thrones eighth and final season begins this Sunday, April 14, there is a lot of chatter here on Forbes.com and around the web. For those who don’t have a cable TV subscription already, they are looking for the best possible deal to watch it.
This March 29, 2019 photo shows actress Kerry Ingram posing for a portrait in Los Angeles. Ingram portrayed Shireen Baratheon in the HBO series ""Game of Thrones."" The final season of the series premieres on Sunday. (Photo by Rebecca Cabage/Invision/AP)
Rebecca Cabage/Invision/AP I know that people are scrambling to find a way to watch it because the reputable mobile data and analytics provider, App Annie , tells me so:
“App Annie’s mobile market data shows that historically, HBO — including both its HBO GO and HBO NOW apps — has seen significant increases in downloads, revenue and usage correlating to the Game of Thrones (GoT) season premieres. The network provider continues to see a sustained lift in monthly active users (MAU) after each season ends, ultimately growing its active user base over time.”
Game of Thrones is a serious market-moving phenomenon. HBO is sitting in a great spot. So, due to your productivity (and possibly mine) dropping because we are spending time trying to find the best premium cable television program deals, here are two apps and options:
Of course, HBO NOW is the primary app. If you don’t have a cable or broadband package already, then it offers access to all HBO programs for $14.99 per month. With the free 7-day trial, you could start now and have time to watch the GOT Season 8 premiere more than once.
Amazon Prime Video with the HBO add-on (same as direct from HBO NOW $14.99/month after 7-day trial). Prime is $119 per year when you pay annually, otherwise it is $12.99 per month. Considering that so many consumers are already Prime members (for the free shipping) and that’s a sunk cost, so it is roughly the same cost as HBO NOW direct with extra perks and programs that are not on HBO. Sweet deal if you are a college student as you can get Prime Student at the discounted price of $59 per year (or $6.49 per month). That's about half the cost of a standard Prime plan.
The iOS HBO NOW app does not have super high ratings, but the HBO NOW on Android is rated better. Not that you are going out to switch phones to watch one show.
HBO NOW App Screenshot Game of Thrones Android
App Screenshot by TJ McCue Overall ratings on the Amazon Prime Video app are far better for both iPhone / iPad Amazon Prime Video app users (4.8 stars on 1.1 million reviews) and the Amazon Prime Video on Android is equally good, though lower overall number of reviews. So I would suggest reading some of the tech comments to decide for yourself. I downloaded the HBO NOW app on a Samsung S7 and it looked fantastic.
In 2019, App Annie expects 10 minutes of every hour spent consuming media — across TV and internet — will come from viewers streaming video on mobile. That means that you might as well use the most direct app, HBO NOW , so that the rest of your mobile time is focused and productive. When you are not re-watching Game of Thrones, that is.

One of manager Torey Lovullo’s devices to maintain the confidence among his starting pitchers when they are on the mound, even those who are at the top of the pay scale, is to shield them from the possible distraction of the bullpen telephone. When the bullpen phone rings in the dugout, the D-Backs do their best to make sure no one hears it.
Sometimes they do not even use it.
“We have a strategy for that,” Lovullo said.
“We’ll either wait for the roar of the crowd and (pitching coach) Mike Butcher will stand right next to the phone so they won’t hear it ringing. Or on certain nights we will just use walkie-talkies. That’s how valid these feelings are in these players. They could hear the phone ring and it can change their mindset. That ought to tell you what showing a lot of faith in a pitcher or player can do for you.”
Inasmuch as baseball is first, second and always pitching, the D-Backs’ plan makes sense.
Yes, major league players are financially secure. D-Backs No. 1 starter Zack Greinke will make $31.5 million this season, which, if he remains healthy, works out to just less than $1 million a start and just less than $10,000 per pitch. No. 2 Robbie Ray will make $6.05 million this year. As on most teams, the salary of their pitching staff is greater than that of the position players.
Pitchers do not take the mound with money in mind, of course, and the D-Backs are doing their best to ensure that no kind of outside noise interferes with their work.
Lovullo believes in giving his starting pitchers a lot of rope, so much so that he is more likely to be one batter late in removing a starter than one batter early. The proof is in the numbers. The D-Backs’ starters were second in the NL with 921 2/3 innings in 2018 and third with 941 1/3 innings in 2017, Lovullo’s first season.
The ringing of a dugout phone, or even the sight of a reliever getting loose in the bullpen, can be a way to sew doubt on the most important player on the field, he believes.

“That’s a very valid thought,” he said. “I want to show the starting pitcher that there is no better option down in the bullpen. It’s on him. When they stand on the mound and they look for help, there is nobody that is going to save the day and fly in with a blue cape. They are the guy we are looking at.
""A player that is full of confidence and has the mindset ‘I got this’ is what I want to create. I want their minds to be empty and clear and focused. There is a fine line there. You start showing players you are losing confidence in them, they can react in a very negative way. The more confidence I can show in guys, the better off they are going to be.
“This game is hard enough. I don’t want to add any negativity to their vibe. I want their mojo to be moving in a very good direction. Sometimes a manager can have a very positive or a very negative effect on what is going on at that key situation.”
Lovullo has played and worked with both types in a 28-year pro baseball career.
“I learned that from playing for some very good managers who had a calming effect,"" he said, ""and I learned that from playing for managers who were throwing phones all over the place. That guy didn’t work for me. It made more uptight. I want them to have a very relaxed attitude out there.”
And if that means using a walkie-talkie, 10-4."
Why More Kids Are Going To The ER For Swallowing Objects,www.forbes.com,Bruce Y. Lee,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/04/12/why-more-kids-are-going-to-the-er-for-swallowing-objects/,"What did you just eat? (Photo: Getty Images) Getty Gulp. A study published in Pediatrics showed that the rate of young kids going to emergency departments for swallowing non-food items more than doubled from 1995 to 2015. And most of these non-food items weren't good things to swallow, like pride.
These findings came from an analysis performed by a research team from Nationwide Children's Hospital (Danielle Orsagh-Yentis, Rebecca J. McAdams, Kristin J. Roberts, and Lara B. McKenzie). It was a NEISS (pronounced ""nice"") study. NEISS stands for National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, a database that tracks people who suffer product- or activity-related injuries and then go to one of approximately 100 hospital emergency departments in U.S. For this study, the research team searched NEISS for kids less than six years of age who went to emergency departments for swallowing foreign bodies during the time period spanning from 1995 to 2015. This search found 759, 074 such cases during this time period. In 1995, there were 9.5 such visits per 10, 000 children. In 2015, this rate had jumped by 91.5% to 18 per 10,000 children.
Here were the most common objects swallowed: Coins (61.7%) Jewelry (7.0%) Batteries (6.8%)
The top-swallowed item adds new meaning to wanting your kids to change. Most ( 65.9%) of the ingested coins were pennies.
Over the two decades of the study period, there was an over 150-fold increase in the rate of batteries ingested. This was probably driven by the increasing use of button batteries, which are quite small and comprised 85.9% of the batteries swallowed. If the researchers had found an increase in the number of car batteries swallowed by kids then that would have had other implications.
If a swallowed object is something small enough, smooth, non-magnetic, and without harmful chemicals, it will probably eventually pass via poop. In a Lego swallowing study that I wrote about previously for Forbes , the FART ( Found and Retrieved Time) score for five Lego-swallowing adults volunteers ranged from a little over one day to about three days. Problems arise when the swallowed object is shaped in a way that may damage or get caught up in the kid's gastrointestinal tract or contain dangerous substances like batteries do.
This Children's Hospital of Philadelphia video shows additional dangers of button batteries including carrying an electrical charge:
If your kid swallows a button battery, call Poison Control and your doctor as soon as possible.
Then there are magnets, which can be an attractive situation. But not in a good way. If you swallow one magnet, the last thing you want to do is swallow another one. Because magnets are like Ted Mosby and Robin Schabowski from the television series How I Met Your Mother. They keep trying to get back together again, even if it means twisting, turning, and even tearing through your intestines. This can severely damage or block your intestines, which may be require emergency surgery.
This CNN segment shows a case of a kid swallowing 37 magnets:
Therefore, if your kid swallowed a magnet, call your doctor.
The study's numbers probably underestimate the rate of kids swallowing non-food items. Not all such ingestions may result in visits to emergency departments. A parent may just wait for the object to pass or take the kid to a clinic instead. In fact, the parent may not even realize that the kid has swallowed an item. Sometimes missing coins may go unmissed or at most result in ""Hmm, I thought I had a 77 cents in change but looks like I only have 20.""
What's been driving this increase in swallowed non-food items? Well, the increased availability of smaller and smaller household items such as button batteries may be factor. After all, many mobile devices that have smaller parts such as smartphones didn't really exist back in 1995. But that wouldn't explain the increase in coins swallowed. Coins have decreased in value but not in size. Are parents just leaving more stuff around their homes? Perhaps. Another question is whether parents are more distracted and paying less attention their kids, allowing their kids to roam around more unattended. After all, while you are busy arguing with others on Facebook, your toddler may vacuuming up coins like his Ponzi scheme has just been discovered.
Regardless of the reasons, it is important to remember that little kids put things in their mouths. That's how they figure things out and explore the world. Of course, eventually, most kids grow out of this habit, otherwise they'd be fired from their real estate and marketing jobs. At least, they should be. But as long as you have kids less than six years old roaming around in your home, make sure that you take proper precautions. Don't leave out in the open things that you wouldn't want swallowed. This includes items that may be removed from other objects, such as button batteries. Make sure that all swallow-able items are properly stored and secured. Beware of toys and household items that may be separable or detachable. Unless you are Magneto, keep your kids away from magnets. Avoid purchasing small items that you can't manage properly.
And, of course, pay attention to your kids and what they are doing. Time passes faster than you may anticipate and so might 57 cents in change. Bruce Y.

Ex-Patriots Wideout Chris Hogan Catches On With Panthers After Quiet Month,www.forbes.com,Oliver Thomas,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2019/04/12/ex-patriots-wideout-chris-hogan-catches-on-with-panthers-after-quiet-month/,"After running three years of routes with the New England Patriots, Chris Hogan now finds himself a Carolina Panther. The veteran wide receiver signed a one-year deal with Carolina on Friday, having seen his market through a month of unrestricted free agency come and go quietly.
“You know, it’s a business,” Hogan said of the Patriots’ decision not to re-sign him on his introductory Panthers conference call . “I can’t really read too much into it, because at the end of the day they’re trying to run the team the way they see fit. Sometimes things just don’t work out, and I understand that. I’m just really excited about this opportunity that the Panthers have given me. I’m really excited to get to work.”
Hogan, who will turn 32 in October, caught 107 passes for 1,651 yards and 12 touchdowns over his last three regular seasons of work with New England. He tacked on an additional 34 receptions for 542 yards and four touchdowns in the postseason.
That playoff sample size included a nine-catch, 180-yard, two-touchdown performance in the AFC title game of January 2017 against the Pittsburgh Steelers for Hogan, as well as a six-catch, 128-yard, one-touchdown performance in Super Bowl LII against the Philadelphia Eagles.
But the writing appeared to be on the wall in a contract year.
Hogan, who originally signed a three-year, $12 million offer sheet with the Patriots as a restricted free agent in 2016, caught just 35 passes for 532 yards and three touchdowns over the course of all 16 games this past regular season.
The regular season prior, in contrast, he caught 34 passes for 439 yards and five touchdowns over the course of only nine games due to a shoulder injury.
The targets became few and far between for the former undrafted free agent by way of Penn State lacrosse and Monmouth football, who’d made stops with the San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills before landing in Foxborough.
Hogan played 63 of 72 offensive snaps for the Patriots in Super Bowl LIII versus the Los Angeles Rams this February. He went without a reception through six throws from quarterback Tom Brady.
Brady and the Patriots go forward with a depth chart that features the game’s MVP in Julian Edelman, as well as Phillip Dorsett, Bruce Ellington, Maurice Harris, Braxton Berrios, special-teams captain Matthew Slater and potentially Josh Gordon.
Dorsett re-signed on a one-year pact as the 2019 new league year began. Ellington and Harris arrived as unrestricted free agents one-year pacts of their own. And Gordon, who remains under indefinite suspension for violating the terms of his reinstatement under the NFL’s substance-abuse policy, garnered the original-round restricted tender of $2.025 million.
As for Hogan, he now joins a company of QB Cam Newton receivers headlined by D.J. Moore, Curtis Samuel and Torrey Smith.
And as the oldest wideout on the current roster.
“A new team. A new organization,” added Hogan, who carried a cap number exceeding $3.2 million in 2018. “Another chance for me to prove myself and prove to these guys that I can be a valuable part to this team and help them win football games any way I can.”

Anthony Crolla Results: KO Highlight (VIDEO), Analysis And Twitter Reaction",www.forbes.com,Brian Mazique,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2019/04/13/vasiliy-lomachenko-vs-anthony-crolla-results-ko-highlight-video-analysis-and-twitter-reaction/,"WBA and WBO Lightweight champion Vasiliy Lomachenko (13-1, 10 KO) might be the best fighter in the world, and with every performance, I get closer to removing the ""might"" from the sentence. For now, Terence Crawford and Canelo Alvarez still have every right to consider themselves the best in the world. On Friday night at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Lomachenko walked through his mandatory title contender Anthony ""Million-Dollar"" Crolla (34-7-3) and he finished the evening with a devastating, fourth-round, one-punch KO. Take a look at it below:

Lomachenko gets the 4th round stoppage. That right hook came from the shoulder that got surgery. Is he the p4p #1 ? #lomacrolla pic.twitter.com/jvO0FAbZF0

Crolla fell face first to the canvas as the punch connected on his temple and the top portion of his ear. He was woozy for several minutes after getting to his feet. Throughout the fight, Crolla was being criticized for his tentativeness. He was clearly intimidated by Lomachenko's overall skill set, and he fought like a guy who just wanted to see the evening end.
In the third round, Lomachenko thought he'd secured the TKO finish. The champion unloaded on Crolla with a damaging combination that caused referee Jack Reiss to step in to signal an official knockdown. It was the right call as one of Lomachenko's punches forced Crolla so deep into the ropes that he would have gone down without the support.
Lomachenko showed why he’s the best in the world tonight with this KO. #LomaCrolla pic.twitter.com/vEYw71fc55

Lomachenko thought he'd won the fight and began his celebration. Once things were sorted out, the round ended. Lomachenko wasted no time resuming his dominance and quickly scored the fourth round KO.
Here's how the boxing community reacted to the finish:
Vasyl Lomachenko is in a different sport to all. Leagues above. Every second you get to watch him you're seeing an all-time great in action. People talk about football fans lucky to be living in the Messi and Ronaldo era. Boxing fans now should be grateful Lomachenko is here now.

— Anthony Walker (@AntWalkerMMA) April 13, 2019
After the bout, Lomachenko called out WBC champion Mikey Garcia but didn't sound too confident in getting the fight. There's a good reason for that. Garcia is with Premier Boxing Champions and the chances of Top Rank (Lomachenko's promoter) and Al Haymon (the man at PBC) working together are about as slim as Crolla's prospects of winning on Friday night.
Initially, Lomachenko was supposed to face IBF champion Richard Commey. The latter suffered a hand injury in his last fight (the bout that won him his title) and was shelved. Lomachenko instead fought his mandatory challenger for the WBA title–which was Crolla.
Boxing insider Mike Coppinger mentioned Teofimo Lopez in one of his tweets posted above. Lopez is another Top Rank product. He is one of the most highly regarded young fighters in the sport. He has been chasing Lomachenko for months, but the champion hasn't given him a ton of attention because he doesn't have a belt.
Lomachenko is hellbent on unifying the entire lightweight division, which is an admirable goal–especially in the current boxing climate. However, most believe a fight with Lopez would be at the very least, interesting. Perhaps that is what's next for Lomachenko after another stunning performance.
As for Crolla, hopefully, he's OK after a scary KO and is able to resume his career safely."

UFC 236 Full Fight Video: Watch Max Holloway TKO Brian Ortega,www.forbes.com,Trent Reinsmith,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2019/04/13/ufc-236-full-fight-video-watch-max-holloway-tko-brian-ortega/,"Max Holloway’s second defense of his UFC featherweight title came in December when he met Brian Ortega in the main event of UFC 231. Both fighters were on impressive runs heading into the bout, which took place at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Holloway had won 12 straight fights before meeting Ortega. Meanwhile, Ortega was unbeaten in 15 contests. The only blemish on the challenger's record was a 2014 no contest when his submission win over Mike De La Torre was overturned after Ortega failed a drug test for the steroid drostanolone. Ortega served a nine-month suspension for that failed drug test. When he returned to action, he ran off six straight stoppage wins.
Somewhat surprisingly, the champion was the underdog on fight night. Ortega entered the octagon as a -120 favorite over Holloway, who was a slight -110 underdog.
The fight was an entertaining affair, but it was also one-sided. Holloway dominated the contest. His performance landed him in the UFC record books. Over the course of the fight, which was ended by the cageside doctor at the end of the fourth stanza, Holloway landed 290 significant strikes, which set a UFC record for a single fight . In the fourth round, the champion stuck Ortega with 134 significant strikes, which set a UFC record for most significant strikes landed in a single round. Despite the loss, Ortega shared a UFC record with Holloway. The duo landed a combined 400 significant strikes in the contest, which set a UFC single-fight record.
The outing earned both competitors “Fight of the Night” bonuses. Holloway also picked up a “Performance of the Night” bonus.
Holloway moves up to lightweight to take a face Dustin Poirier in the co-main event of tonight’s UFC 236 fight card. The winner of the bout, which takes place at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, will claim the interim UFC lightweight title.
Before Holloway and Poirier meet, you can watch the featherweight champion’s win over Ortega right here."
U.S. Businesses 'Allowing' Chinese Government Hackers To Steal American Secrets,www.forbes.com,Zak Doffman,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/04/13/u-s-businesses-allowing-chinese-government-hackers-to-steal-american-secrets/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Cybersecurity I write about security and surveillance. Share to facebook Share to linkedin Getty On Friday, an investigation by NPR and Frontline claimed that the White House estimates ""technology theft and other unfair business practices originating from China are costing the American economy more than $57 billion a year.""
Last year, a U.S. Department of Justice report to the Senate Intelligence Committee claimed that “from 2011-2018, more than 90% of cases alleging economic espionage by or to benefit a state involve China, and more than two-thirds of the Department’s theft of trade secrets cases have had a nexus to China."" A significant proportion of those thefts traced back to the Chinese government, and if they didn't, they always benefited the Chinese government's economic policies.
This investigation now suggests those thefts are often enabled by the hacked companies themselves. "" In dozens of interviews with U.S. government and business representatives, officials involved in commerce with China said hacking and theft were an open secret for almost two decades, allowed to quietly continue because U.S. companies had too much money at stake to make waves.""
The program interviewed a former U.S. Attorney from Pensylvania who was ""inundated"" with concerns businesses afraid they had been hacked. David Hickton told the program ""I literally received an avalanche of concern and complaints from companies and organizations who said, 'We are losing our technology — drip, drip, drip'.""
Hickton set his sights on Unit 61398 of China's People’s Liberation Army. A well-reported militaristic office tower of 'cyber warriors' that has been known about for some time and which targets overseas companies with industrial-scale cyber theft. ""They were really using a large rake,"" Hickton said of the military group. ""They were taking everything ... personal information, strategic plans, organizational charts. Then they just figured out later how they were going to use it.""
A national security threat 'no-one had heard of'
Michael Wessel, the commissioner on the U.S. government's U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, told the program that when China joined the WTO in 2001, ""there was a honeymoon period in the first six or seven years, a desire to try [to] make things work.""
It didn't last. In December, two Chinese nationals were charged with hacking more than 45 companies in coordination with China's state security service. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said that this level of "" outright cheating and theft gives China an unfair advantage at the expense of law-abiding businesses,"" adding that ""we know what China is doing it, we know why they are doing it, and in some instances, we know who is sitting at the keyboard.""
The scale of Chinese state cybertheft from the U.S. ""is unacceptable,"" former Attorney General John Sessions said in November. ""International trade has been good for China, but the cheating must stop, [and] China cannot be a safe haven for criminals who run to China when they are in trouble, never to be extradited."" Sessions tasked Assistant Attorney General John Demers from the Department's National Security Division with the creation of a 'China Initiative'.
At a media briefing a week ago, Demers reiterated the extent of Chinese IP theft in the U.S. He was joined by the U.S. Attorney for Massachusets, who described the ""long-term, pervasive, consistent effort by the Chinese government to steal American intellectual property [as] one of the most important national security threats that no one has heard of.”
All roads lead to China
China is an enigma, and t he world's second-largest economy plays by its own rules. The mix of commerce and state, as seen in the emerging AI Cold War, in closed state procurements and strategic state investments, in ongoing trade discussions and posturing, in international arguments about Huawei and 5G , and in the mix of economic surety and national security, are a challenge. For businesses being asked to compete with China, to sell into China, and to defend against China, there are no easy answers.
In recent weeks, both Microsoft and Google have found themselves answering questions about the extent of their work in China. Microsoft for co-authoring three papers on AI with a Chinese university with military links and which raised questions relating to surveillance and Xinjiang and the level to which western technology might be helping to develop China's surveillance state. Google for seeming to step back from supporting U.S. military development programs, while maintaining AI work in China that, according to politicians and U.S. military leaders, results in furthering China's military technologies.
Talking of Google, cast your minds back to the company's statement issued in 2010: ""W e [have] detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google... T his attack was not just on Google. We have discovered that at least twenty other large companies from a wide range of businesses--including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors--have been similarly targeted. We are currently in the process of notifying those companies, and we are also working with the relevant U.S. authorities.""
Nine years later and unsurprisingly ""n one of the dozens of companies or organizations that NPR reached out to that have been victims of theft or corporate espionage originating from China would go on the record.""
That's the problem. And i t's not a problem limited to the U.S. On Thursday, the Dutch newspaper Financieele Dagblad reported on the theft of trade secrets from chipmaker ASML by ""high-ranking R&D employees of the company"" linked to the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology."" Again, the company had played down any discussion on Chinese state involvement, a market from which it now generates $2 billion in sales.
China, for their part, is not open to the discussion. ""China firmly preserves cybersecurity, always opposing and cracking down on any forms of cyber theft, "" according to a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. ""The Chinese government has never participated in or supported any theft of trade secrets. We do not accept and are firmly opposed to such accusations.""

Does Technology Help Or Hinder Humanity? A Discussion With Sir Martyn Lewis,www.forbes.com,Sol Rogers,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/solrogers/2019/04/11/does-technology-help-or-hinder-humanity-a-discussion-with-sir-martyn-lewis/,"I first met former broadcaster, Sir Martyn Lewis, back in January. We met at an event I was hosting on marketing innovations at The Club at The Ivy in London. During the Q&A, he questioned me on the impact technology was having on humanity. It was a lively discussion, and one we both wanted to continue - so we reconvened earlier this week to do just that.
Sir Martyn Lewis and I at The Club at The Ivy
REWIND Martyn and I met on what could well go down as a controversial and potentially game-changing day in the UK for websites and social media: the day the government published the Online Harms White Paper - a plan to put an end to the era of self-regulating internet platforms. We dealt with that elephant in the room first.
Illegal and unacceptable content, bullying, propaganda designed to aid or abet terrorist attacks, algorithms which can lead to ‘echo chambers’ or ‘filter bubbles’, inciting violence...there's a lot for the public to be concerned about - hence the need for a new regulatory framework to improve our safety online.
The 98-page-document is out for a 12-week consultation and it raises the prospect of an independent regulator, a new code of practice, fines for breaking rules and a levy to fund a regulator.
HM Government As Martyn said: ""A lie is up and halfway around the world before the truth has got its boots on.""
Fake news can easily be spread with social media. Rules are needed. This topic could have taken over the whole evening, but we had a lot of ground to cover, so we moved on and whirled through a number of subjects, from 5G to driverless cars, cyber warfare to the space race. It was a ‘tour d'horizon’, as Martyn described it.
One of the first discussion points was online shopping and the impact on the high street. I wrote about this very subject a couple of months ago. Everyone has empty shops in their local communities, and it’s upsetting, but cheaper prices and convenience are driving people online. However, while technology is killing the high street, there is an argument that it could also save it - innovations like AR mirrors and virtual changing rooms could inject new interest in retail and drive more traffic in-store.
We couldn’t have gone through the evening without mentioning robots: should we tax them? Will we get to a point that they are making the rules? Can robots be creative? Should we give robots the ability to be illogical? I answered yes to all of these.
Getty Next, we discussed the ramification of AI taking over 25% of jobs. While there was talk on what the jobless might do with their time, we both came back to the money side of things. Some countries are already looking at alternatives like Finland and the universal basic income experiment. But we’re far from a solution that has global appeal.
""Does tech destroy our ability to develop relationships?” asked Martyn. We now interact with a device more than each other. Technology is so important to Millennials that 53% would rather give up their sense of smell than their tech . Over 80% sleep with their mobile phone and 32% of Millennials check social media from the toilet. But an upside to all of this is the frequency in which we now communicate. I ‘chat’ to my mother via Whatsapp now more than I ever did before.
On to education: Martyn wanted to know if I believed technology “enabled people to learn faster, learn more? Will tech result in a better-educated society?”. As a former university lecturer, this subject really resonated. To have the world's knowledge at our fingertips is amazing. MR will democratize intelligence and VR is the learning aid of the 21st century. More thoughts on this subject in this article I wrote in March.
Getty Martyn asked, “do we need to be well behaved all the time on the assumption that someone is listening constantly?” I replied, “do we care who is listening? Who decides who is behaving well?” We could have spent a lot longer on this topic!
Space, the final frontier... “Rovers on the moon, man on Mars...why are we having this space race?” asked Martyn. I replied that the space race is sharpening and focusing the mind on solving some big technological problems. Plus, it brings us together in moments of awe and unites us with feelings of pride for what we have achieved; what we have achieved through the power of technology.

Getty Suddenly, an hour had gone.
A final thought from Martyn: “I wonder if in the rush to develop new technology, some people are not thinking enough about uses of older tech - the technology that has been left behind? Is there enough lateral thinking going on, or are we always constantly looking to one new device after another?” I agreed that we are interested in the shiny, the new, the ‘what’s next’; and we do need to take a step back sometimes. But, the need to progress through technology is part of humanity - that drive to invent and change will always be there.
Sometimes, we just need to remember that we can get inspiration from the everyday and simple things in life.
We are on the cusp of a fourth industrial revolution, and it’s challenging our idea of what it means to be human. New technologies that combine digital, physical and biological worlds are creating massive change at great speed. However, whether these are forces of innovation or disruption really comes down to our individual and societal beliefs. Martyn and I certainly weren’t going to solve the world’s problems in an hour...I feel another session coming on! In the meantime, you can watch the full discussion here ."

Ask Ethan: How Does Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry Allow Us To Image A Black Hole?,www.forbes.com,Ethan Siegel,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/04/13/ask-ethan-how-does-very-long-baseline-interferometry-allow-us-to-image-a-black-hole/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Science The Universe is out there, waiting for you to discover it. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin HD 163296 is representative of a typical protoplanetary disk viewed by the DSHARP collaboration. It has a central protoplanetary disk, outer emission rings, and gaps between them. There ought to be multiple planets in this system, and one can identify an odd artifact interior to the 2nd-from-the-outermost ring that may be a telltale sign of a perturbing planet. The scale bar at lower right is 10 AU, which corresponds to a resolution of only a few milliarcseconds. This can only be achieved through VLBI. S. M. Andrews et al. and the DSHARP collaboration, arXiv:1812.04040 The Event Horizon Telescope has accomplished what no other telescope or telescope array has ever done: imaged the event horizon of a black hole directly. A team of more than 200 scientists using data from eight independent telescope facilities across five continents all joined together to achieve this monumental triumph. While there are many contributions and contributors that are well-deserving of being highlighted, there's a fundamental physics technique that it all depended on: Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry , or VLBI. Patreon supporter Ken Blackman wants to know how that works, and how it enabled this remarkable feat, asking:
[The Event Horizon Telescope] uses VLBI. So what is interferometry and how was it employed by [the Event Horizon Telescope]? Seems like it was a key ingredient in producing the image of M87 but I have no idea how or why. Care to elucidate?
You're on; let's do it. Any reflecting telescope is based on the principle of reflecting incoming light rays via a large primary mirror which focuses that light to a point, where it's then either broken down into data and recorded or used to construct an image. This specific diagram illustrates the light-paths for a Herschel-Lomonosov telescope system. Wikimedia Commons user Eudjinnius
For a single telescope, everything is relatively simple. Light comes in as a series of parallel rays, all originating from the same distant source. The light strikes the telescope's primary mirror, and gets focused to a single point. If you put an additional mirror (or set of mirrors) along the light's path, they don't change that story; they simply change where that light winds up converging to a point.
All of those light rays arrive to that final point at the same time, where they can then be either combined into an image or saved as raw data, to be processed into an image at a later time. That's the ultra-basic version of a telescope: light arrives from a source, gets focused into a small region, and recorded. A small section of the Karl Jansky Very Large Array, one of the world's largest and most powerful arrays of radio telescopes. Unless the individual dishes are properly synchronized together, they will not achieve any higher resolution than a single dish. John Fowler
But what if you don't have a single telescope, but multiple telescopes that are networked together in some sort of array? You might think that you could just go about the problem in a similar way, and focus the light from each telescope the way you'd do it for a single-dish telescope. The light would still arrive in parallel rays; each primary mirror would still focus that light down to a single point; each telescope's light rays arrive at the final point at the same time; all that data can then be collected and stored.
You could do that, of course. But that would only give you two independent images. You could combine them, but that would only average the data out. It would be as though you observed your target with a single telescope at two different times, and added the data together. The Square Kilometer Array will, when completed, be comprised of an array of thousands of radio telescopes, capable of seeing farther back into the Universe than any observatory that has measured any type of star or galaxy. SKA Project Development Office and Swinburne Astronomy Productions
That doesn't help you with your big problem, which is that you need the critical enhanced resolution that comes with using a network of telescopes linked together with VLBI. When you successfully link multiple telescopes together with the VLBI technique, it can give you an image that has the light-gathering power of the individual telescope dishes added together, but (optimally) with the resolution of the distance between the telescope dishes.
This technique has been famously used many times, not merely for imaging a black hole and not even with radio telescopes alone. In fact, perhaps the most spectacular example of VLBI was used by the Large Binocular Telescope , which has two 8-meter telescopes that are mounted together, behaving with the resolution of a ~23-meter telescope. As a result, it can resolve features that no single 8-meter dish can, like erupting volcanoes on Io while it experiences an eclipse from another of Jupiter's moons. The occultation of Jupiter's moon, Io, with its erupting volcanoes Loki and Pele, as occulted by Europa, which is invisible in this infrared image. The Large Binocular Telescope was able to do this owing to the technique of interferometry. LBTO
The key to unlocking this type of power is that you need to be able to put your observations together at the same moments in time. The light signals that are arriving at the telescopes are arriving after slightly different light-travel-times, owing to the varying distance, at the speed of light, that it takes the signal to travel from the source object to the varying detectors/telescopes on Earth.
You must know the arrival time of the signals at the different telescope locations across the world in order to be able to combine them together into a single image. Only by combining data that corresponds to viewing the same source simultaneously can we achieve the maximum resolution that a network of telescopes is capable of offering. This diagram shows the location of all of the telescopes and telescope arrays used in the 2017 Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87. Only the South Pole Telescope was unable to image M87, as it is located on the wrong part of the Earth to ever view that galaxy's center. Every one of these locations is outfitted with an atomic clock, among other pieces of equipment. NRAO
The way we do this, practically, is by making use of atomic clocks. At every one of the 8 locations across the globe where the Event Horizon Telescope takes data is an atomic clock, which enables us to keep time to precisions of a few attoseconds (10 -18 s). There was also the need to install specialized computational equipment (both hardware and software) to enable the observations to be correlated and synced up between the different stations around the world.
You have to observe the same object at the same time with the same frequency, all while correcting for things like atmospheric noise with a properly-calibrated telescope. It's a labor-intensive task that requires enormous precision. But when you get there, the payoff is astounding. The protoplanetary disk around the young star, HL Tauri, as photographed by ALMA. The gaps in the disk indicate the presence of new planets. This system is already hundreds of millions of years old, and the planets there are likely nearing their final stages and orbits. This resolution is only possible owing to the use of VLBI by ALMA. ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO)
The above image might look like it has nothing to do with a black hole, but it's actually one of the most famous images from the most powerful single array of radio telescopes out there: ALMA. ALMA stands for the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array, and is composed of 66 independent radio dishes that can be adjusted to be spaced apart from 150 meters all the way up to 16 kilometers.
The light-gathering power is just determined by the area of the individual dishes all added together; that doesn't change. But the resolution it can achieve is determined by the distance between the dishes. That's how it can achieve resolutions down to just a few milli-arc-seconds, or resolutions of 1/300,000th of a degree. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are some of the most powerful radio telescopes on Earth. These telescopes can measure long-wavelength signatures of atoms, molecules, and ions that are inaccessible to shorter-wavelength telescopes like Hubble, but can also measure details of protoplanetary systems and, potentially, even alien signals that even infrared telescopes can't see. It was the most important addition to the Event Horizon Telescope. ESO/C. Malin
But as impressive as ALMA is, the Event Horizon Telescope goes even farther. With baselines between the stations approaching the diameter of Earth — more than 10,000 km — it can resolve objects as small as around 15 micro-arc-seconds. This incredible improvement in resolution is what enabled it to image the event horizon of the black hole (which is 42 micro-arc-seconds across) at the center of the galaxy M87.
The key in obtaining that image, and in performing these high-resolution observations in general, is to sync up every one of the telescopes with observations that are absolutely coincident in time. To make this happen is simple conceptually, but required a monumental innovation to put this into practice. In VLBI, the radio signals are recorded at each of the individual telescopes before being shipped to a central location. Each data point that's received is stamped with an extremely accurate, high-frequency atomic clock alongside the data in order to help scientists get the synchronization of the observations correct. Public Domain / Wikipedia user Rnt20
The key advance came in 1958, when scientist Roger Jennison wrote a now-famous paper : A phase sensitive interferometer technique for the measurement of the Fourier transforms of spatial brightness distributions of small angular extent. That sounds like a mouthful, but here's how you can understand it in a straightforward fashion. Imagine you have three antennae (or radio telescopes) all hooked up together, and separated by particular distances. These antennae will receive signals from a distant source, where the relative arrival times of the different signals can be computed. When you mix the different signals together, they'll interfere with one another, both due to real effects and due to errors. What Jennison pioneered — and what's still used today in the form of self-calibration — was the technique to properly combine the real effects and ignore the errors.
This is known today as aperture synthesis , and the basic principle has remained the same for over 60 years. In April of 2017, all 8 of the telescopes/telescope arrays associated with the Event Horizon Telescope pointed at Messier 87. This is what a supermassive black hole looks like, where the event horizon is clearly visible. Only through VLBI could we achieve the resolution necessary to construct an image like this. Event Horizon Telescope collaboration et al.
What's fantastic about this technique is that it can be applied to literally any wavelength range at all. Right now, the Event Horizon Telescope measures radio waves of a particular frequency, but it could theoretically operate at a frequency between three and five times as high. Since the resolution of your telescope is dependent on how many waves can fit across your telescope's diameter (or baseline), going to higher frequencies translates into shorter wavelengths and higher resolution. We could get five times the resolution without needing to build a single new dish.
The first black hole may have just arrived a few days ago, but we're already looking to the future. The first event horizon is really just the beginning. In addition to that, the Event Horizon Telescope should someday be able to resolve features of distant blazars and other bright radio sources, enabling us to understand them as never before. Welcome to the world of VLBI, where if you want a higher-resolution telescope, you just need to move the ones you have farther apart! Send in your Ask Ethan questions to !

Bitcoin And Crypto Market Cap Hits Another Yearly High--Here's Why,www.forbes.com,Billy Bambrough,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/04/13/bitcoin-and-crypto-market-cap-hits-another-yearly-high-heres-why/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Crypto & Blockchain I write about how bitcoin, crypto and blockchain can change the world. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin
The bitcoin price exploded at the beginning of the month, leaving traders and analysts unsure of what exactly caused the sudden upswing and causing many to doubt whether bitcoin , ethereum, Ripple's XRP, litecoin, EOS, and bitcoin cash would be able to hold on to their recent gains.
However, earlier this week, the total bitcoin and cryptocurrency market capitalization, the combined value of some 2,000 cryptocurrencies, hit another year-to-date high according to CoinMarketCap data, climbing to $186 billion, with bitcoin making up an eye-watering $90 billion of that—though the broader rally has been labeled ""altcoin season"" due to some of the double-digit gains many smaller cryptocurrencies have made. The bitcoin price surge has helped the wider cryptocurrency market hit a year-to-date high this week. CoinMarketCap
This week's continued bitcoin and altcoin price rally comes amid the launch of a Coinbase cryptocurrency card spending card in the U.K. and bullish comments from many bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry watchers and analysts, causing a surge in sentiment that's allowed most major cryptocurrencies to maintain their new, higher prices.
""After the false breakout earlier this week, cryptos took a step down,"" Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at brokerage eToro wrote in a note to clients. ""The fact that we failed to go further up speaks volumes about the current appetite, but it doesn't necessarily mean it will go lower, as many bears have indicated.""
Ahead of bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market hitting a new year-to-date high, technical data appeared to show bitcoin is at its most overbought since December 2017 , when it hit its all-time high, with similar trading patterns preceding heavy sell-offs.
""In fact, in my view, the most likely scenario is that we now create a new range, or even, hopefully, a sustained stabilization ... The market is clearly still excited,"" Greenspan added. The bitcoin price climbed to around $5,400 per bitcoin earlier this week before falling back somewhat. Coindesk
The total bitcoin and cryptocurrency market cap spike hit as shortly after investment management firm BKCM’s Brian Kelly, a bitcoin and crypto industry commentator, told CNBC's Fast Money that institutional adoption, coupled with a growth in crypto networks, will ""without question"" push bitcoin past its $20,000 high, set in late 2017, over the coming two years.

How Ground Beef Is The Suspected Cause Of The E. Coli Outbreak,www.forbes.com,Bruce Y. Lee,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/04/13/how-ground-beef-is-the-suspected-cause-of-the-e-coli-outbreak/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has indicated that ground beef (not specifically the one pictured here) is the likely source of an E. coli outbreak. (Joan Barnett Lee/Modesto Bee/MCT via Getty Images) Getty If you like ground beef, you may have a beef with this announcement. Or maybe you don't want to have a beef, depending on what you prefer. On Friday, the Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC) announced that ground beef is now the suspected cause of the Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) O103 outbreak.
This is the ongoing outbreak that I wrote about for Forbes last week . Since then, the number of reported cases has gone up to 109 (from 72). The number of states affected has increased from 5 to 6 with Indiana being added to the mix. And the number of hospitalizations has more than doubled from 8 to 17. Fortunately, no deaths have occurred to date.
The CDC didn't just hit the ground running with suspecting ground beef. Instead, investigators interviewed people who have gotten ill, asking them about what they had come into contact with and eaten the week before symptoms had begun. They then compared the answers with results from previous surveys of the general population, trying to determine what may have been different about the people who had gotten Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC ) O103 infections. One thing stood out: of the 75 interviewed, 63 (84%) had reported eating ground beef in the week prior. That's unusually high. Compare the 84% to the 39.8% of the population sample for the 2006-2007 FoodNet Population Survey who reported eating ground beef in the previous seven days .
Investigators are also conducting traceback investigations. This involves walking backwards to see where suspected food items may have come from to determine if there is a common source. Thus, the investigators are asking the people who got sick where they had eaten or purchased their ground beef. Then they are asking these restaurants and stores about who supplied their ground beef. And so forth. Basically, the investigators are traveling backwards through the supply chain that got the beef from the farms all the way to the plates of people, testing samples where relevant along the way. So far, these traceback investigations have not yielded a common source. But such investigations take time, especially when personnel and resources are limited.
So far, the CDC has not told anyone to completely avoid ground beef. For now, just be careful with ground beef, wherever you got it from, and use standard precautions. Wash thy hands thoroughly and frequently whenever you touch raw ground beef. The same applies to anything else that touches raw ground beef. If you don't normally do these things at all times, please do not throw any dinner parties ever.
Of course, this is not the time to try ground beef sushi or sashimi. Make sure that you thoroughly cook any ground beef before eating it, heating it to at least 160°F, the temperature needed to kill E. coli . Use a thermometer, because unless you are a thermometer, you can't tell whether the inside of the beef has reached that temperature. You've heard of the saying that you can't judge a book by its cover? Well, you can't really tell a beef temperature by its color. Beef turning brown alone does not mean that the temperature to kill E. coli has been achieved. Moreover, move the thermometer around while cooking, since all parts of the ground beef need to reach that temperature to ensure that no living STEC remains. Use a thermometer to check the temperature of burgers cooking on the grill. (Photo: Getty Images) Getty
Also, if you don't store raw beef properly, you will be in store for a lot more bacteria. When you buy raw ground beef, make sure that you refrigerate or freeze it within two hours. Don't go watch Captain Marvel in the movie theater first. If you aren't going to use the ground beef for a while, freeze it. Don't keep raw ground beef in the refrigerator for longer than 2 days. Until you are ready to cook the raw ground beef, keep it in either refrigerator or freezer at all times. There should be no reason to leave raw ground beef at room temperature for any length of time. If you need to thaw frozen raw ground beef, do it in the refrigerator.
When you eat at a restaurant, it is a little harder to stick your thermometer into the beef while it is cooking. The chef may tell you to go stick your thermometer somewhere else, and doing so may not be very pleasant. An alternative is to ask whomever is taking your order to confirm that all ground beef will be cooked to internal temperatures of at least 160°F. Don't be bashful about making such inquiries. Be suspicious of any food establishment that makes light of any food safety concerns. Run away from any place that pushes back on your request, otherwise you may get the runs or worse. (OK, maybe you should walk away rather than run away.)
The CDC and other public health officials remain on the ground, so to speak, to further investigate this outbreak. Beef on the lookout for any updates. Bruce Y.
