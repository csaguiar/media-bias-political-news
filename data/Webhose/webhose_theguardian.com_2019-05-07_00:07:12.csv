"Girli: Odd One Out review – gutsy, rough-edged debut | Music | The Guardian",www.theguardian.com,Peter Robinson,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/07/girli-odd-one-out-review-debut-album-milly-toomey,"(PMR). W hether it’s Dua Lipa or Billie Eilish, pop in 2019 is all about sophistication and understatement, a development to which 21-year-old electro-new-wave artist Girli seems entirely oblivious. The brash pop of Odd One Out suggests the Londoner either missed the memo or, as Milly Toomey’s candid, gutsy and intermittently convincing persona would probably frame it, tore it up.
In any case, this debut packs some impressive punches – like the sparky Day Month Second and ambitious wobbler Friday Night Big Screen . Elsewhere, Girli’s rough-edged pop – if nothing else, a welcome respite from the prevailing chart sound – feels undermined by clumsy songwriting. Rhyming “lights on” and “fash-on” in the Charli XC esque Deal With It feels intentionally awkward; “party” and “party” five seconds later makes you wonder.
It’s apt that Odd One Out arrives in the wake of news that MySpace accidentally deleted every song uploaded during its glory years: messily enjoyable tracks such as Stick Out sound like something straight off a 2007 profile page. Back then, these DIY-sounding punky songs would have landed Girli a record deal. Whether they’re strong enough for her to keep one in 2019 is a different matter.

Was this the week Britain’s two-party politics began to shatter? | Politics,www.theguardian.com,Toby Helm,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/07/week-britains-two-part-political-system-shattered,"Splits, pivots, last-minute votes … and blocked plumbing. Another extraordinary week in the Commons shows how Labour and the Tories are more divided than ever and ever less able to solve Brexit. E arly on Thursday evening, six Tory grandees who have been on opposing sides during more than 40 years of Tory civil war on Europe crammed on to a red leather bench in the House of Lords and sat shoulder to shoulder as peers debated a bill on delaying Brexit .
At one end was former chancellor Lord Lawson, who resigned from Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet in 1989 over the Exchange Rate Mechanism and is a now a hardline Brexiter. Next to him was another former chancellor, Lord Lamont, who took the UK out of the ERM on Black Wednesday under John Major in September 1992 and is a lifelong Eurosceptic.
At the other end of both the bench and the Conservatives’ ideological divide sat former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine, a career Europhile and now a leading grandee in the campaign for another referendum. Between them were Lord Maclean, a former Tory chief whip with years of experience of managing the party’s splits on Europe, Lord Howard, the pro-Brexit ex-Tory leader, and the Leave-supporting former Conservative party chairman Lord Baker.
A Labour peer who looked on from the opposite benches said: “It was an extraordinary sight, a glimpse back over decades of Tory division on Europe. And pure Spitting Image .”
Somehow, despite the deep differences on Europe, which helped end the premierships of Margaret Thatcher, John Major and David Cameron, and will soon curtail that of Theresa May, the Conservative party has just about held together as a fighting force, during the long careers of these grandees. But for how much longer?
Down the corridor, as the Lords voted and debated, MPs in the Commons had had to abandon their afternoon sitting a couple of hours earlier as water poured into part of the chamber, the result of blocked gutters in a building in desperate need of renovation. The symbolism was lost on no one. The Brexit crisis had caused its own blockage in British politics, and deadlock within and between the main parties that only deepened as deadlines approached. So paralysed was parliament that May had, on Tuesday, made an effort to bridge the divides and finally deliver a Brexit solution. She offered to sit down with Jeremy Corbyn to find a way forward. The only way was consensus. Or was it?

Within hours of May making her grand offer to the Labour leader, Tory MPs were fulminating. Yes, their own party might be split – but the idea of consensus with Labour was even more unthinkable than agreeing among themselves.
At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, before May and Corbyn had even started a first round of discussions, May faced more hostile questions from her own side than from Labour. Caroline Johnson, Tory MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham, asked why she could not countenance a no-deal Brexit – rather than talk to the despicable enemy. “When we have to balance the risk of a no-deal Brexit versus letting down the country and ushering in a Marxist, antisemite-led government, what does she think at that point is the lowest risk?” The former Brexit minister David Jones asked: “Does it remain the Prime Minister’s position that the Leader of the Opposition is not fit to govern?” If so, why was she involving him in determining the shape of Brexit? Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the hardline, pro-Brexit European Research Group, was equally, contemptuous saying the PM seemed to want to “do a deal with a socialist who doesn’t want Brexit.”

It was not only the Tories who were finding it impossible to find compromise with their political opponents or among themselves. On Wednesday evening Corbyn, a lifelong Eurosceptic leading a mainly Remain-inclined party, called a special meeting of his shadow cabinet to debrief it on progress in the cross-party talks. Labour’s internal tensions and divisions on Brexit policy boiled over. Corbyn told the meeting that talks had been constructive but there had been no breakthrough, and said the idea of a confirmatory referendum, demanded by most party members, was part of the discussion.
At the end of the meeting – after Tom Watson, the deputy leader and Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, had spoken strongly in favour of a confirmatory ballot – the party chairman Ian Lavery, who is against the idea, blew a fuse. “He was very angry and wagged his finger at Jeremy, telling him that if he backed a referendum he would go down in history as the Labour leader who split the party,” said one shadow cabinet member. “Jeremy just sat there.”
Another who was present said Lavery’s outburst was “extraordinary and very hostile”. Lavery added that he knew his comments would be leaked. Another member of the shadow cabinet, health spokesman Jon Ashworth, had warned Corbyn in the meeting that all previous experiments in cooperation with the Tories had ended in disaster for Labour and that Corbyn should heed history’s lessons. Colleagues thought he had in mind the party’s first prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, who is still regarded by many as a traitor for running a government with the Conservatives during the great depression.
What makes it impossible in practice is that neither leader can afford to give any real ground. If they do, they know they the consequences would be to split their parties irreparably
Former Tory minister Ever since the 2016 referendum put the UK on course to leave the EU, both May and Corbyn have tried to manage the deep divides on Europe in their own parties over Brexit. But managing division by avoiding hard choices is no longer possible if a consensus is to be reached. The UK is due to leave the EU without a deal on 12 April unless the House of Commons reaches agreement. It is decision time. But the moment of choosing what sort of Brexit the country should have has brought internal divisions even more to the fore. As one former Tory minister who resigned recently over Brexit said on Wednesday: “A cross-party solution to Brexit should be possible – in theory. What makes it impossible in practice is that neither leader can afford to give any real ground. If they do, they know the consequences would be to split their parties irreparably. Take the issue of a permanent customs union which Labour is demanding. If May endorses that half her cabinet resigns. Corbyn is trapped too. If he is seen to have helped get a Tory Brexit over the line, he will never be forgiven by most of his own party who are against Brexit and want a second referendum. We’re all just screwed.”
If there is agreement on one thing at Westminster these days, it is that the two main parties almost certainly cannot survive Brexit in their current forms. Neither the Conservatives nor Labour offers a comfortable home either for convinced Brexiters or ardent Remainers. Conversations with MPs and ministers about the future of politics post-Brexit increasingly move towards a conclusion that Brexit will accelerate a realignment. Two-thirds of the Tory party is made up of hardline Brexiters and the other third comprises soft and hard Remainers. As one Remainer Tory MP put it: “After all this, it is impossible to see the likes of Dominic Grieve [strongly Remain] sitting in the same party as Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson. A split is coming.”

For Labour, the divide is more than just about Brexit, but has been bought into sharper focus by it. It is also about what kind of party Labour is – a Corbynite leftwing force or a social democratic, strongly internationalist one. The former Labour cabinet minister Lord Adonis said: “Brexit is the dominating issue for Labour’s social democrats. Labour will split if Britain leaves the EU and the party is complicit in Brexit, because there is no viable policy for prosperity and equality while pursuing a Thatcherite Brexit.” Already eight Labour MPs have quit the party to join the pro-EU Independent Group. Three Tory MPs have joined them. More could soon follow. Last week the Tory MP Nick Boles said he could no longer sit as a Conservative MP after his compromise plan on Brexit was rejected by many of his colleagues. Slowly, the old order is changing. Corbyn’s deputy Watson is forming a group of around 100 MPs from the non-Corbynite wing of the party. The group’s backers say it is a “non-Marxist, social democratic” grouping “within Labour”. Soon after Easter it will begin work on its own policy ideas, separate from Corbyn’s team.
As new alliances form, there are signs that voters are deserting the two main parties as a result of their Brexit divisions. On Friday, Labour retained the seat of Newport West but both Labour and the Tories saw their share of the vote fall as smaller parties, including Ukip and the pro-EU Greens, benefited.
Political polling expert David Cowling says the conditions are ripe for change. “The Conservative-Labour vote share in 2017 was 84%. In the 15 polls last month it was an average 71%. Political realignment had been prophesied before but realigning MPs has proved easier than realigning voters. However, although our electoral system is heavily stacked against change, the public mood has seldom been more fertile for new political growth.”
If, as seems increasingly likely, Brexit is delayed and the UK is forced to take part in European elections, they could provide opportunities for new forces in British politics. The Independent Group of MPs hopes to field candidates for all 73 seats in the 12 UK regions under the name Change UK and will use the elections to make the case for remaining in the EU. From the other side of the Brexit debate, Nigel Farage will lead his new Brexit party. On Friday, Farage put out two tweets looking forward to the European elections. “This is an exciting moment. We have arrived at a tipping point. The splits affecting the Conservatives and Labour have become so significant they begin to fall apart,” was one. In another he said: “I will lead @brexitparty_uk into the European elections. The fightback to save Brexit has begun.” And so, perhaps, have profound changes in British politics.

My not-so-cross-party audience with Theresa May was a long time coming | Rupa Huq | Opinion,www.theguardian.com,Rupa Huq,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/07/rupa-huq-cross-party-meeting-theresa-may-long-time-coming,"The prime minister should have reached out earlier to the opposition. A s someone who’s always said the vibe in parliament could do with being less cross and more cross-party, when Theresa May’s “Dear colleague” letter landed, assuring MPs her door was always open, I jumped at the chance. In the Commons chamber, I waved it at the prime minister to test her sincerity and, televised for all to see, as all MPs’ utterances are, asked about my turn.
On Thursday, I found myself in May’s Downing Street lair, face to face with the PM I had faced publicly so many times before across the party divide.
I thanked her for granting me an audience and the televised address and said that extending the hand of friendship to Jeremy Corbyn was a huge improvement on her recent call for the public to take their Brexit anger out on their elected representatives. “Some of us have tormentors who need no encouragement,” I said.
We each had one note-taker. When I asked if Keeley Hawes’s home secretary in Bodyguard was an accurate depiction, she turned nonplussed to hers (who has since been promoted to health minister due to gaps in government that needed plugging). My mention of Fleabag drew a blank too. They both chanted in unison that she “ prefers NCIS ”.
No matter what happens with Brexit, this toxic environment must end | Rupa Huq Read more
Cod-psychological articles in the foreign press shared gleefully on social media by Remainers have claimed May’s character is unsuited to negotiation due to her lack of charm and inability to deviate from script.
Other MPs say May mostly listens and then declares the meeting over, so I avoided rabbiting and threw a series of questions her way. Some she responded to with questions: when I asked about the possibility of budging on the customs union, she replied: “What would one want to achieve with one?” On whether the Brexit deal would be coming back to the House, she answered: “It depends.” Regarding the illegality of Leave, she said there were discrepancies on both sides. A fresh “people’s vote” was resolutely rejected. I asked which red lines had changed. She raised her eyes to heaven before lowering her head on to the desk in a swooping movement of mock exasperation, demonstrating a sense of humour and contradicting the Maybot stereotype.
Tories say they have been to No 10 many times this year for miscellaneous drinks in the run-up to the first meaningful vote. Alas, I had only snuck in to Downing Street once before when I half-inched my sister Konnie Huq’s invitation to Gordon Brown’s Eid party.
As a non-DUP/ERG backbench opposition MP, I wanted to voice Remain concerns. I didn’t ask what bribes she could offer, notwithstanding constituency infrastructure inducements allegedly dangled at Labour Leave seat MPs.
No one fears the wrath of Remainers, who have essentially been told to shut up and acquiesce
This has all unfolded in the wrong order – cart before horse. As a minority government, reaching out the hand of friendship across the aisle would have been better done after the general election when her majority was so carelessly lost, rather than folding one’s arms or throwing overtures to those on her own side trying to knife her in the back. I pointed out she had been to my own suburban west London seat (won from the Tories in 2015 by 200-odd votes) during the 2017 election campaign when they were polling 20 points ahead with the expectation of taking it back. The constituency now has a Labour majority of about 14,000, swelled by Tory Remainers worried about their financial passporting rights.
Unlike the riots predicted if we don’t leave the EU, no one fears the wrath of Remainers, who have essentially been told to shut up and acquiesce. It’s said that Waitrose was empty on the day of the “people’s vote” demonstration. Certainly the million individuals marching with polite placards dramatically contrasted with the angry mob (Tommy Robinson et al) in Westminster on 29 March when the meaningful vote was lost a third time – which has put many Labour MPs off voting for a Leave deal, as I told the PM. I cited the 6 million people who have signed the petition to revoke article 50, including 23,000 in my own seat (more than the Tory votes cast in 2017), and admonished her that she risks not only breaking up the union but also losing London because of a policy that is at least as much of a dud as the poll tax. I reminded her that at least Margaret Thatcher had the good sense to ditch the policy.
I emerged blinking into the sun. A not unpleasant experience but I’m not sure I’m any the wiser.

And of which treasury boffins say there is a 70% chance of it being -$4.1 billion and +$24.8 billion. In other words a guess. A guess that's 12 months out from happening. And based on things like 3.5 percent wages growth. Wages growth has not been that high since this government was elected in 2013. Not once. That means the numbers are already dodgy because it's based on higher income taxes that won't happen because the higher wages won't happen. Then there's the guess that commodities prices will remain high even though there's been a slew of reports confirming multiple countries cutting back on coal. And that includes China. If the media were really doing their job they would just pull Friedandburnt and Moronson up once and for all and say there is no budget surplus.

People on $200,000 might want more money in their pocket. But really they are doing quite nicely as it is. Thanks you.

Whereas for those on $60,000 an extra $1380/ year , $26.50/week may help with many needs.
Of course the funds to non government schools, private health insurers will keep flowing.
But reduced tax collected likely effect public school resources, which 65% of Australian children attend. So less resources for many children, 1.1 million living in poverty, or those who have learning difficulties.

Some people begin training as therapists as a consequence of having therapy, and all therapists will be in therapy during their training and some beyond. During that time they should have explored themselves and their past in great depth, including examining and considering their motives with the therapist. And it shouldn't be difficult to determine when someone is using and treating therapy training as therapy.
Most who have been through this process, and it can take years, are capable of making a clear distinction and separation between their needs and those of their patient, and of recognising when any blurring of this occurs. That isn't something a responsible therapist would disregard, they will think about it and discuss it in supervision, where hopefully it can be dealt with and resolved. But if it is the case that a therapist is being affected by the material their patient is bringing in a way that makes them unable to be emotionally and therapeutically available to them, then they should refer them on to another therapist.
Therapists are human, of course, and it is very important that they are able to acknowledge when they feel themselves becoming vulnerable in some respect, and acting on it in a way which best serves their patient."

'We had to fight': the Swiss youth group taking on right-wing populism | World news | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,Jon Henley,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/07/we-had-to-fight-operation-libero-the-swiss-youth-group-taking-on-populism,"How do you beat rightwing populists? With pink socks, viral videos, condoms – and an iron determination not to let them decide what matters.
That’s how Operation Libero are doing it anyway.
As advancing nationalist parties prepare to meet in Milan on Monday to forge an alliance in the run-up to May’s European elections, anti-populist activists in Switzerland may have some lessons on halting – even reversing – the seemingly unstoppable rise of rightwing populists.
“It’s about the political space, who’s defining and shaping it, who’s communicating strategically within it, who, basically, is holding it,” says Flavia Kleiner, 28, the group’s self-assured co-president, over tea in a Zurich bookshop and coffee house.

“At the moment, in lots of places, it’s populists. Everywhere, the conversation’s about identity: who we are, where we’re from, the past. But that’s their turf. We have to go on the offensive – clear the fog, refocus attention, reframe the debate.”
As the ground zero of postwar European populism, Switzerland is home to arguably Europe’s most consistently successful rightwing populist party, the Swiss People’s party (SVP). For 25 years, the SVP had been steadily building its electoral success through a series of increasingly nation-first, anti-immigration popular referendums.
In February 2016, months after the SVP had scored its highest ever share of the vote, 29.4%, in national elections, with the political mainstream seemingly helpless to halt its advance, Switzerland went to the polls again, this time for an SPP-sponsored referendum demanding the automatic deportation of immigrants found guilty of even minor offences.
Had the proposal passed, any of the country’s two million non-Swiss residents – a quarter of the population – caught, for example, speeding twice in any 10-year period, could have been automatically returned to their homeland, with judges barred from considering personal circumstances.
It didn’t pass.
Voters rejected it overwhelmingly by 59% to 41%, on a higher turnout – at nearly 64% – than for any popular referendum in years. “One moment we were talking about immigration and doing just fine,” the SVP’s leader said at the time. “The next, everyone was talking about rule of law. I don’t know what happened.”

What happened was Operation Libero. The movement had just chalked up the first in an unbroken series of victories over popular referendums pushed by the SVP. The latest, on giving Swiss law precedence over international law , was defeated in November last year by 66% to 34%.
In cantonal elections in Zurich last month, which are seen as a reliable indicator for October’s national elections, the biggest losers, by far, were the SVP, whose share of the vote plunged lower than at any time since 1995.
“The populists don’t know what’s hit them, and they really don’t know how to deal with it,” says Constantin Seibt, one of the country’s most respected journalists and editor-in-chief of Republik, a record-breaking, crowdfunded news startup.
“All they can manage is to bleat ‘It’s not fair. They’ve got all these young people, and somehow they keep turning everything we say against us’. Well, those young people have changed the dynamics of the country. The populists seem to be running out of steam. It’s pretty cool.”
Operation Libero was formed by a handful of mainly student friends soon after the “political earthquake” of 2014, when the SVP narrowly won a potentially crippling referendum to curb EU immigration. “We had to fight because we did not want to live in a country like this,” says Kleiner.
Also there at the beginning was communications director Silvan Gisler, 31, a former journalist. “It was just, ‘Fuck, this really has just happened,’” he says in the group’s offices, which are based in a slightly scruffy office block around the corner from Zurich’s red light district. “And had everyone done enough to stop it? No.”
Operation Libero was a working title but it “kind of stuck”, Gisler said. “You know, in football there used to be a player called the ‘libero’ – the last defender, but also the one who gives the first pass to the attack. And ‘operation’ conveyed urgency. We are a movement, not a party. But above all, we’re about values and action.”
From the outset, the group adopted a radically different approach. Its first, modest campaign was in late 2014, against another popular referendum, Ecopop, which envisaged “limiting the population to a level compatible with the preservation of the country’s natural resources” – notably, of course, by restricting immigration.
Helped by small-scale crowdfunding, the group launched a tongue-in-cheek campaign. An army of young volunteers handed amused nightclubbers condoms in bright pink packaging, commanding them to “prevent disaster: have sex against Ecopop”.
Soon after, it launched a campaign for same-sex marriage, which it is still pursuing (“It’s vital that we’re not just reactive. That we say what we’re really for, not just what we’re against,” says Gisler) with viral social media videos featuring cute same-sex couples on ski-lifts in wedding gear telling passersby they are “unhappily unmarried”.

The breakthrough, though, came that day in February 2016. “It was clear that if we talked about criminal foreigners, we’d become the defenders of criminal foreigners,” says Kleiner. “We’d have lost before we started.
“Instead, we set the terms of the debate by portraying the SVP’s proposal as an attack against fundamental Swiss values. Against the constitution as a pillar of our liberal democracy; the rule of law; equal justice for all. We were the patriots here, because this was an attack on things that every Swiss citizen holds dear.”
She first thought they might win, Kleiner says, the day she heard two women talking about the upcoming referendum in a shop: “One said, ‘Can you imagine? It would mean a family man, a father, being deported, just like that, for driving a bit too fast.’ And the other said: ‘I wouldn’t want that happening to me. It’s not right.”
Success brought money and the means to do more. Operation Libero has about 1,500 members paying a CHF50-100 (£38-£76) annual subscription; 10,000 donors, mostly giving sums less than CHF250; 5,000 volunteers on call and four regional sections. It employs seven part-time staff and is organised to a degree that is positively, well, Swiss.
The office is all charts and whiteboards, with six campaigns – some, still secret – mapped across weekly timelines. Post-it notes and to-do lists cover walls and desks. At clockwork-smooth morning meetings plans are discussed, projects refined, ideas floated, timings decided, messages polished, responsibilities allocated.

Thank you for your feedback. Sign up here for a weekly roundup from this series emailed to your inbox every Friday Of necessity, and because it works, much of the group’s work is online. Besides the viral videos, it enlists “online warriors”, more than 100 at any one time for major campaigns, to engage on social media platforms. These are not trolls, Kleiner insists. They use their own names, offer arguments rather than invective and are under orders to stay polite and never escalate.
Fuschia pink, Operation Libero’s brand colour, vibrates everywhere. Merchandising, in the form of startlingly pink socks, sits in piles under desks. “Trump sucks, Wilders sucks, Le Pen sucks, Petry sucks,” says one video, from two years ago. “Populism sucks. Make 2017 great again. Buy Libero socks.”
“You have to have fun,” says Gisler. But the group’s youthful enthusiasm – most Operation Libero staff are in their 20s or early 30s – is married to a campaign-hardened professionalism. The slogans, images and posters they devise themselves are as hard-hitting and attention-grabbing as those of their opponents, dreamt up by an expensive political advertising agency.
“We spend so much time getting them right,” says Gisler. “It’s so important to have the right content, smart content. To frame the debate right. Content has to have substance, depth, rigour. But it’s also how to say it – the visuals and the message. It has to be short enough, catchy enough, popular enough, to really break through.”
Kleiner wants eventually to see a new alliance of progressive, liberal democratic movements and parties across Europe , of which Operation Libero could be a part. “The SVP say they’re defending ordinary Swiss people against the state and a global elite but they’re actually weakening the structures and institutions that secure those very individuals’ freedoms,” she says. “It’s the populists who are on the attack!”

Politics now, Kleiner believes, has moved far beyond the left-right divide, or even the progressive-conservative divide. “It’s increasingly, actually, about constructive versus destructive,” she says. “That’s really where we are.”
Her top tips for combating rightwing populism? Reframe the debate, obviously. But beyond that, “You have to be accurate, honest, understandable. You have to be serious about what you’re doing, responsible – but at the same time keep it fun, light. That’s not always easy. It’s really hard sometimes, actually. And you have to be positive.”
Underpinning everything, says Kleiner, is an ambition just to “change the mood. The thing that’s there but no one sees. To move away from the fear and pessimism the SVP have instilled in the Swiss mentality, change that narrative. We don’t want some defensive, inward-looking museum of a country. We’re looking forward, with hope, to a Switzerland we want to live in in 2050.”

Universities defy funding shortfall to spend millions on art | Education | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,msn.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/apr/07/cambridge-spent-one-million-pounds-on-bust-of-queen-victoria,"Cambridge’s £1.6m purchases head the list of Russell Group universities that found money to buy artwork for their campuses despite financial uncertainty. Cambridge University spent more than £1.6m on works of art last year, an Observer investigation reveals, at a time when UK universities are facing severe financial uncertainty, with many warning of staff redundancies.
The university spend on art in 2017-18 – which excludes any donated works – does not include acquisitions made by its individual colleges, which are separate legal entities and public authorities, so the overall figure is likely to be higher.
A £1m marble bust of Queen Victoria, which had been earmarked for export, and a £380,000 Nicolas de Largillière portrait, were among works bought in the period, both for the Fitzwilliam museum.
Neither was acquired with central university funding, but with donations and a grant.
With almost one in four English universities reporting deficits last year, Paul Cottrell of the University and College Union said: “Spending thousands on works of art while students rack up record debt and staff pay is held down is not a good look. Research shows that students value substance over style and that they want to see the hard work of staff properly rewarded. Universities would do well to remember that staff are their most valuable asset and should focus on improving pay and conditions.” Cambridge was one of several Russell Group universities to spend thousands on artwork for their campuses. Leeds University spent over £500,000, University College London £300,000, and Warwick £100,000. Oxford University refused the freedom of information request on the basis that it would cost more than the appropriate £450 limit to source the information.
A Cambridge University spokesperson said: “The university is home to eight extraordinary museums – all open to the public free of charge – which together contain more than 5 million objects, artefacts and works of art of international stature. As is the case with most publicly-funded museums in the UK, our purchasing power is very limited.
“When a work of art is occasionally purchased for our collections, it is normally with funds donated by philanthropists specifically for that purpose, or with sums that cannot be spent in any other way. Some come to us thanks to enlightened government schemes, such as Acceptance in Lieu.”
Cambridge received a £100m donation from an alumnus in February, believed to be the largest donation from a British donor in recent history. The university says £1m of that donation will help fund its access programmes, aimed at attracting disadvantaged students to the university.

Lean times even for Heston’s Fat Duck as rising costs hit restaurant industry | Business | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,Jamie Doward,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/07/heston-blumenthal-losses-double-british-restaurants-struggle,"Top chef’s losses double as insolvency rate for UK restaurants climbs. He may be the nearest thing Britain’s food scene has to an alchemist but that cannot shield Heston Blumenthal from the cold winds blowing across the country’s restaurant business.
Accounts filed last week for Snail Porridge Limited, parent company of the chef’s flagship restaurant The Fat Duck, his gastro pub The Hind’s Head, his TV programming arm and several other businesses showed losses more than doubling last year.
In the year to 31 May 2018, turnover at the company dropped only marginally, to £12.4m, but post-tax losses increased, from £700,000 to £1.7m.
The accounts reveal the threats that the restaurant trade faces as costs rise and expansion plans are reined in. A £500,000 investment in a new project was written off by the company’s directors, who do not believe the money can be recovered.
In a statement, the company told the Observer : “Our results in the past couple of years have reflected the decline in profitability of some of our restaurants, but we believe that we are now through the bottom of that cycle and are starting to see the impact of our efficiencies.”
Blumenthal is not alone in finding the going tough. Jamie Oliver’s business empire reported a loss of nearly £20m last year and has been forced to close outlets. And Kavalake, Gordon Ramsay’s holding company, which manages several of London’s most famous restaurants, including Pétrus and the Savoy Grill, reported a pre-tax loss of £3.8m in the year to the end of August 2017.
The number of restaurants filing for insolvency has nearly doubled in the past eight years, according to a report published last December by the accountants Moore Stephens.
“It’s tough out there for everybody,” said Stefan Chomka, editor of Restaurant magazine. “It’s well-documented that [the] mid-market has probably suffered the most , with the likes of Jamie and Byron Burger closing restaurants. But the problems they’ve got are happening across the board. The higher-end restaurants are having to cope with the same rising costs of ingredients, staff, rent and rates.”
Among the risk factors cited in Snail Porridge’s accounts are Brexit, national living wage increases and rising food prices.
“To keep standards high, Heston’s place has to employ a huge amount of staff, [and] their wage bill is growing and growing,” Chomka said. “These sort of businesses use the best-quality ingredients. Butter is now almost six times the price it used to be – expensive butter probably 10 times the price; fish and meat are more expensive. Restaurants operating at these high levels can’t cut back on the quality, so they are having to suck it up.”
Snail Porridge, whose parent company, Cape Proprietary Inc, is incorporated in Nevis, a tax haven, says it is working through an “efficiency and development programme” to increase its profitability.
“To provide a fine-dining experience at a realistic price for the diner, but which is also profitable, is not easy and it requires careful management of costs, principally relating to ingredients and labour,” the company said. “The Fat Duck has always been profitable, as its business model is established and its appeal as a special dining destination is undiminished.”
Accounts released earlier this year show that the Fat Duck reported pre-tax profits of £297,788, down from £533,145 the previous year.
Chomka said it was encouraging to hear that the company believed it was at the bottom of the cycle. “But what we are seeing is restaurants continuing to open, especially in London,” he said. “So I can’t see things getting easier in the near future.”
