The Emperor brings new hope to 'Star Wars: Episode IX',us.cnn.com,Brian Lowry,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/entertainment/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker/index.html,"(CNN) The Emperor is back, and with him, a new hope for ""Star Wars: Episode IX.""
The Emperor's trademark cackle at the end of the new trailer , and a surprise appearance by the actor who plays him, Ian McDiarmid, saved the best for last at the Star Wars Celebration presentation devoted to the next movie, which also revealed its subtitle, ""The Rise of Skywalker."" Related: 'Star Wars: Episode IX' trailer is finally here Still, it was the suggestion that the Emperor -- who appeared to die in ""Return of the Jedi"" -- would again somehow be part of the story that provided a surge of enthusiasm for the next movie, and seems in some way to address many of the criticisms aimed at the previous one, ""The Last Jedi."" One of the complaints about ""Last Jedi"" involved the lineage of the character of Rey, played by Daisy Ridley, after all the speculation devoted to how she might connect to characters of the past. Read More In essence, the tantalizing possibilities that ""Star Wars"" enthusiasts spent two years analyzing and debating after ""The Force Awakens"" were largely dismissed by director Rian Johnson's movie, in a way that left many (including this critic ) feeling disappointed. Whatever the explanation, bringing the Emperor back creates a powerful link to the original trilogy, and the promise of a denser addition to the ""Star Wars"" mythology. It also gave an additional wallop to a line spoken in the trailer by the unseen presence of Luke Skywalker, ""No one's ever really gone."" Obviously, the concluding installment in what has been billed as the Skywalker family saga was going to be a huge deal, and the anticipation for the December release was destined to be enormous, even with the naysaying about Episode VIII. But seeing McDiarmid on stage, somehow, just made ""The Rise of Skywalker"" feel a whole lot bigger -- a movie where, after some misgivings, suddenly the sky's the limit."
Social media progressives are drowning out centrist Democrats (opinions),us.cnn.com,John Avlon,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/opinions/twitter-distortion-2020-dems-avlon/index.html,"John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst and anchor.

(CNN) If you believe what you read on Twitter, you might think the Democratic electorate is made up entirely of proto-socialists trying to ""out-woke"" each other in a daily outrage Olympics.
John Avlon But while social media mobs are loud, they're not the real deal. Study after study shows that if you are getting your opinion of the political state-of-play primarily from social media platforms, you're barking up the wrong feed. Or, as CNN's Harry Enten put it, ""Want to understand the 2020 Democratic primary? Stay off Twitter."" He points out that Democratic electorate polls consistently put Joe Biden ahead of Bernie Sanders in the 2020 race. But you might get the opposite impression if you were looking only at social media. As Enten writes , ""Fans of other candidates (especially Sanders) make their presence known quite loudly...."" In other words, there's a sample set bias. Pew Research dug into this and found that liberal Democrats are especially likely to use social media. Throw in social media algorithms that show people what they are interested in, and this can easily lead to a hive mind. Read More Approximately half of Democrats who describe themselves as moderate or even conservative are far less likely to proselytize on social media . That's not to say that there isn't a growing progressive movement in the Democratic party. But it's not disproportionately dominant. And remember, the number one issue for Democrats in 2020 isn't ideological purity, but who can beat Donald Trump . Donald Trump is sabotaging America's democracy This disparity was displayed on the front page of the New York Times Tuesday in an article titled , ""The Democratic Electorate on Twitter Is Not the Actual Democratic Electorate."" The Times piece features graphics that show that this ""outspoken group of Democratic-leaning voters on social media is outnumbered"" by the more centrist and more diverse Democratic voters who are less likely to post political content online. And all along, we thought the ""silent majority"" was just a Republican phenomenon. All this goes hand in hand with the fact that social media tends to skew younger and more liberal. Consider this: Enten's analysis shows that among Democrats who use Twitter, those under 50 outnumber the overall population of Democrats by almost 20 points. But that doesn't represent the reality of the Democratic electorate or the fact that older Americans are far more likely to actually go out and vote . So while social media can give the impression of being a direct connection with the Democratic street, it actually over-samples a new kind of activist elite. It amplifies ideological divides, often drowns out dissent from liberal orthodoxy and leads to what former President Barack Obama recently described as a ""circular firing squad, where you start shooting at your allies because one of them is straying from purity on the issues.""

Look, social media is an amazing tool. It's changed the way we communicate. It can help democratize objectively oppressive regimes overseas. But as we've all seen, it's also highly susceptible to being hijacked by hyper-partisans as well as trolls and bots on a disinformation mission to divide. So don't mistake this virtual world for what's actually happening in Main Street America."
Top Chicago prosecutor asks for 'independent review' into handling of Jussie Smollett case - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Amir Vera,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/chicago-prosecutor-independent-review/index.html,"(CNN) Kim Foxx, Chicago's top prosecutor, has asked the Cook County inspector general to investigate her office's handling of Jussie Smollett's criminal case, a spokesperson from Foxx's office confirmed Friday.
The Cook County State's Attorney's office dropped 16 felony charges against the ""Empire"" actor, who was accused of staging a hate crime against himself in Chicago. Smollett agreed to forfeit $10,000 in bail and do community service. Inspector General Patrick Blanchard will be conducting the investigation. Why did prosecutors drop all charges against Jussie Smollett? ""Ensuring that I and my office have the community's trust and confidence is paramount to me, which is why I invited an independent review of this matter,"" Foxx said in a statement provided to CNN. ""I welcome this investigation and pledge my full cooperation and the cooperation of my office as IG Blanchard conducts his review."" Blanchard also released a statement confirming his office was ""pursuing an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the resolution of criminal charges in the Smollet case."" Blanchard told CNN Friday that Foxx requested his office review their handling of the Smollett case this week and he has no idea how long that investigation will take. Read More ""We are proceeding immediately with this matter, but it is difficult to forecast the length at this juncture,"" Blanchard said, adding he's never been asked by Foxx to review the findings of a state's attorney's case. He said the report will either be made public directly after the review or addressed in a quarterly report that will be made public. Calls for Foxx's resignation are personal, she says The Chicago Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) and a suburban police chiefs association called for Foxx's resignation after holding votes of no confidence April 4. The vote took place more than a week after Foxx's office dropped all charges against Smollett. FOP President Kevin Graham said dropping the charges undermined the public's faith in the criminal justice system. Chicago prosecutor Kim Foxx says calls for her resignation are personal Days later at an event with Rev. Jesse Jackson, Foxx said calls for her resignation run deeper than the Jussie Smollett case. ""I think we have to ask ourselves what is this really about? I've been asking myself for the last two weeks, 'What is this really about?'"" Foxx said. ""I will tell you this is personal, it's personal."" Foxx has previously said she welcomes an ""outside, nonpolitical review"" into how her office handled the Smollett case. She had separated herself from decision-making in the case in mid-February out of ""an abundance of caution."""
"E. coli outbreak: Ground beef is responsible, CDC says",us.cnn.com,"Debra Goldschmidt, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/health/e-coli-mystery-ground-beef-cdc-bn/index.html,"(CNN) Ground beef is the food responsible for a mystery E. coli outbreak involving 109 cases of illness in six states, according to preliminary evidence, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday .
""Ill people in this outbreak report eating ground beef at home and in restaurants,"" the CDC said in its outbreak update. No single supplier, distributor or brand has been identified as the source of the outbreak. Therefore, no recall has been issued, and the CDC is not recommending that consumers avoid ground beef at this time or that restaurants stop serving it. Illnesses are now being reported in six states : Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and Indiana. Mystery E. coli outbreak sickens 72 people in 5 states, CDC says That's one more state and 13 more illnesses since the previous update reported by the CDC on Tuesday. Read More As part of the investigation, 75 of those reporting illnesses have been interviewed by health investigators. Eighty-four of them reported eating ground beef in the week before their symptoms began, according to the CDC. Symptoms include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. They begin, on average, three to four days after ingesting the bacteria. Most people recover in five to seven days. The first reported symptoms from this outbreak began March 2. Seventeen patients have been hospitalized due to their illness. Federal, state and local health officials are continuing to investigate. In the meantime, the CDC reminds consumers to prevent E. coli by washing hands, cooking ground beef to an internal temperature of 160 degrees, as measured with a meat thermometer, and keeping foods that aren't cooked away from raw beef to prevent cross-contamination."
"Congo Ebola outbreak not a public health emergency of international concern, WHO says",us.cnn.com,Susan Scutti,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/health/ebola-public-health-emergency-congo-africa-bn-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo does not constitute a public health emergency of international concern , the World Health Organization's director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said Friday.
Robert Steffen, chairman of the WHO International Health Regulations Emergency Committee, said there is no added benefit in declaring an emergency at this time. ""If it stays within a country, it is, by definition, not an issue of international concern,"" he explained. However, he emphasized that this does not downplay the situation and said everything must still be done to stop this outbreak. The committee's decision was ""almost unanimous,"" Steffen said. WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as ""an extraordinary event"" that constitutes a ""public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease"" and ""to potentially require a coordinated international response."" The outbreak, which began in August, is the second largest and second deadliest on record, with 1,206 total cases and 764 total deaths as of Thursday, according to Congo's Ministry of Health . A 2014 outbreak in West Africa killed more than 11,000 people, according to WHO. Read More A total 1,711 probable cases of Ebola had been reported when a public health emergency of international concern was declared on August 8, 2014, for the West Africa epidemic . Without the emergency declaration, the world is now ""on pace to really have a repeat of West Africa,"" said Jennifer Nuzzo , a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Ebola Fast Facts Differences between then and now In 2014, there was no treatment or vaccine to prevent the spread of Ebola. Due to research advancements since then, experimental treatments and vaccines have been used in Congo. To date, 358 patients have recovered from the illness, and more than 97,000 vaccines have been administered, which some believe has helped limit the spread of the outbreak. WHO spokesman Tarik Jašarević identified the reasons why Tedros reconvened the Emergency Committee on Friday: ""A rising number of security incidents have been restricting access to affected communities in key areas, for vital operations such as surveillance, case investigation, contact tracing and vaccination."" These factors led to a surge in cases in recent weeks after a period of decline, Jašarević wrote in an email Thursday. ""Calling the committee does not automatically lead to a declaration of a Public Health emergency of International Concern,"" Jašarević added. Ebola treatment center attacked again as Congo battles a deadly epidemic In an update from WHO early Friday, it said that ""Though the risk of spread within the country and to neighboring countries is very high, the risk remains low globally. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on currently available information."" The epicenter of the outbreak is North Kivu and Ituri provinces, among the most populous in the nation and bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan, according to WHO. During the past 21 days (ending April 9), a total of 207 probable new cases were reported in 40% of the 141 health areas affected to date, WHO reported in a Thursday update . Not only is North Kivu experiencing this deadly Ebola outbreak, but long-term conflict smolders there, with 50 armed groups causing intermittent violence, according to WHO. The UN public health agency estimates that more than a million refugees and internally displaced people are traveling through and out of North Kivu and Ituri. Meanwhile, bursts of violence, the burning down of Ebola treatment centers and the kidnapping of health workers have plagued the effort from the start. ""The continued increase in cases this past week reflects the complex reality of conducting an effective outbreak response in a geographically difficult area with a highly fluid population, intermittent attacks by armed groups, and limited healthcare infrastructure,"" WHO said in its update. Legal criteria have been met, some argue Lawrence O. Gostin , a professor of global health law and director of the WHO Collaborating Center on Global Health Law at Georgetown University, wrote in an email that, given worsening conditions in Congo, Tedros ""should have declared a [public health emergency of international concern] and made bold new recommendations for bringing the DRC Ebola epidemic under control."" ""The legal criteria for declaring a [public health emergency of international concern] have been met for several months now,"" he said. ""The International Health Regulations do not require actual international spread but only the potential for international spread."" The International Health Regulations , which are legally binding for all WHO member states, aim is to help the global community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. Congo Ebola outbreak not an 'emergency of international concern,' WHO says ""Clearly, the DRC epidemic could spill over to neighboring countries and even to other parts of Africa, even potentially through air travel to North America and Europe,"" Gostin said. An Emergency Committee meeting for the outbreak that was convened in October did not declare an emergency, though the committee's report warned about the potential for further degradation. ""I think the situation has degraded much much further,"" Nuzzo said. Why didn't the director-general declare an emergency in October? At the time, it was said that the emergency committee had examined the available information and determined the outbreak was of regional but not global concern. ""We do have some optimism that this outbreak... will be brought under control in reasonable time,"" Steffen said in October. Nuzzo believes there were additional reasons: ""It's hearsay, I can't prove it, but the rumors are that there was worry about political blowback."" She explained that when international emergencies are declared, countries take actions that are not permitted under international health regulations, such as restricting travel and trade, ""in an attempt to try and protect themselves."" The worry in October was that declaring a public health emergency of international concern would lead to travel restrictions, and this would make it harder for health workers to move into and out of the Congo, she said. The rumors seem to explain Friday's decision, if not October's. ""We also felt declaring a public health emergency of international concern would not aid the situation, it might actually even complicate it,"" Steffen said. However, Nuzzo said, ""although it's understandable that they're trying to prevent unintended consequences,"" that's not what the declaration is supposed to be about. Rather, it is ""supposed to be based on science and what the science says."" During the outbreak in Congo, about 60% of those who have become sick due to the Ebola virus -- which causes fever, severe headache and in some cases hemorrhaging -- have died. On average, past outbreaks have had a 50% fatality rate. Possible consequences of the decision Without a declaration of emergency, there is no pressure placed on countries to acknowledge that this is significant global problem and that officials need to be investing all the necessary resources, including money, technical expertise and security forces, to combat it, Nuzzo said. Opponents say that declaring a public health emergency of international concern doesn't do much, she said. ""Nonetheless, they are the basis of our International Health Regulations, so deciding not to use [the emergency declaration] has other downstream consequences."" One consequence of not declaring an emergency is that ""it establishes an expectation that countries develop the capabilities to be able to detect when an important event is occurring,"" Nuzzo said. Another is that it undermines WHO's future abilities when confronting an international crisis. Due to violence, the US State Department has not allowed the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to deploy staff to the epicenter. The CDC has staff in-country, far from the epicenter, and does not provide information regarding location in order to protect the privacy and safety of health care professionals. WHO deploys vaccines, emergency teams to control Ebola outbreak Nuzzo said she doesn't disagree ""that the situation is dangerous, but I do think that insufficient work has been done to figure out a way to send them safely and to protect them."" ""At the end of the day, there's only a few hundred WHO staff in the field. At the height of Ebola in West Africa, there were well over 1,000 CDC employees deployed."" She gives WHO and humanitarian organizations such as Doctors Without Borders and the International Rescue Committee ""enormous credit"" for their ""tireless"" work. ""They can only do so much, and they also need CDC's technical expertise,"" she said. ""WHO is competent but new at this, and CDC has been doing this for 40 years."" The CDC said it is committed to helping end the outbreak and is preparing to be engaged in response activities for the long haul. Get
Gostin said that ""each day that passes, precious lives die, including brave health workers. Were it not for a highly effective vaccine, the DRC epidemic could easily have been as severe as in West Africa, and we can't let this DRC epidemic slip out of control."" ""I was deeply disappointed that, under these harsh conditions and with so many deaths, that WHO did not do more to break from the usual mold."""
"Medical scopes still causing superbug infections and deaths, FDA says",us.cnn.com,"Debra Goldschmidt, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/health/medical-scopes-superbug-infections-fda-bn/index.html,"(CNN) Three people died and 45 people developed infections from contaminated endoscopes, the US Food and Drug Administration said Friday.
The reports of contamination are with a side-viewing duodenoscope used for a medical procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or ERCP. ""These flexible lighted scopes are vital for minimally invasive procedures to diagnose and treat conditions of the pancreas and bile duct,"" said Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The reusable scopes, which are made by three manufacturers -- Fujifilm Medical Systems USA Inc., Olympus Medical Systems Corporation and Pentax of America -- are known to be difficult to decontaminate. They have been linked to deadly outbreaks of the superbug carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE. The contamination issues result from damaged scopes and improper decontamination. How will the government regulate potentially dangerous medical devices? In 2015, the FDA required the manufacturers to conduct post-market surveillance studies to fix the problem. The agency said Friday, ""The preliminary results as of March 2019 indicate higher than expected levels of contamination."" Read More In December, the FDA said the number of infections and instances of contamination found on devices had declined as a result of safety measures put in place in 2015. ""Our analysis of medical device reports associated with patient infections for duodenoscope indicates that the number of medical device reports peaked in 2015 at 250 reports and declined 62% to fewer than 100 reports per year in 2017,"" according to a safety communication issued by the FDA on Friday. But new reports of contaminated devices and patient infections emerged ""late in 2018,"" the agency said. CRE outbreak: You're due to go in for a procedure. Should you be worried? Among 205 medical device reports that were submitted between October 15 and March 31, there were 45 reports of patient infections, one report of a patient who was exposed to infection but did not become sick, and 159 reports of devices that were contaminated. Those reports also included three deaths in 2018 related to these scopes. ""These reports indicate that although the number of reports has declined, there continues to be a need for improvement of the safety of reprocessed duodenoscopes,"" the report says. The FDA said its recommendations for maintaining and decontaminating the device have not changed. ""The FDA is actively working with reprocessing experts, medical device manufacturers, and other government agencies to advance innovative ways to decrease infection related to duodenoscopes,"" the agency said in its safety communication. Shuren added in a statement Friday, ""But we're continuing to evaluate the benefit-risk profile of these devices, and we'd like to see strong evidence that proper cleaning and reprocessing can virtually eliminate any bacteria residue that can spread infections. Currently, that evidence is lacking, and we're considering what additional regulatory actions may be necessary.""
The agency also noted that it sent warning letters to all three manufacturers of these devices in March 2018 because the companies failed to deliver sufficient data required by post-market surveillance studies. The FDA said the companies all provided plans for continued study and sample collection. The agency said it is still tracking reports of infection and device contamination on a monthly basis. It is also working with facilities and care providers to modify processes and reduce the risk to patients. In addition, efforts are underway to ""encourage the development of new technology and design features, such as disposable components, to enhance patient safety."" Previously, the FDA said that the benefits outweigh the risks of infection from these scopes, which are used for more than 500,000 procedures annually."
Boston hospital sues Saudi prince over $3.5 million in unpaid bills for child with rare disease,us.cnn.com,Jessica Ravitz,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/health/saudi-prince-boston-hospital-lawsuit-bn/index.html,"(CNN) A Saudi prince who promised to foot the bill for a 2-year-old patient's treatment is now being sued for millions by Boston Children's Hospital.
A complaint against His Royal Highness Prince Abdelilah bin Abdelaziz bin Abdulrahman Al Faisal Al Saud of Saudi Arabia and Dr. Hamdy Dawoud, the personal physician and representative for the prince, was filed this week in the federal district court of Massachusetts. It says the defendants owe $3.5 million -- and growing -- in unpaid medical bills for the girl whose care they agreed to sponsor in full. The girl, whose name and other details were not given, has spinal muscular atrophy, a rare disease that affects movement and strength and requires lifelong treatment. She has been in the hospital's care since November 2017. But since then, the prince and his representative ""have paid only $750,000 toward the patient's care despite repeated promises that additional payment will be forthcoming,"" the suit reads. That first and only payment came by check in December 2017. CNN reached out to the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia for comment and to the hospital's lawyers for further statements but did not hear back before publication. Read More Boston Children's Hospital is a ""not-for-profit pediatric medical center"" and a ""worldwide leader in pediatric care and the treatment of complex diseases and conditions."" It offers an expensive treatment for spinal muscular atrophy: the drug Spinraza, which isn't available in the girl's home country. The hospital accepted the patient, who does not have health insurance in the United States, after two employees at Brigham and Women's Hospital vouched for the prince and encouraged the arrangement. One of them was Dr. Phillip Camp, a thoracic surgeon who ""described himself as the 'Prince's surgeon and family friend' "" and said, ""the Prince 'is entirely serious about paying the cost personally, and has the means,' "" according to the court document. The other was Ramy Ibrahim, the hospital's international patient coordinator, who ""coordinates health care for the Prince's family and friends."" But in the many months since that initial payment, even as care was ongoing, the hospital has been unable to collect further payment despite continuous efforts by hospital officials and repeated promises that wire transfers were scheduled, according to the suit. The patient's parents too have said the prince confirmed to them directly that the money was coming.
The situation has left the patient in limbo and the hospital stuck with mounting costs. ""As of the filing of this Complaint, the patient continues to receive inpatient care at BCH, even though, as of this date, acute inpatient care is not necessary,"" the lawsuit says. ""Although a transfer or discharge to assisted home care is warranted, it is highly unlikely that a rehabilitation facility or home care company will accept this patient without assurance of payment."" The lawsuit seeks relief for breach of contract, as well as other charges, and demands a trial by jury."

Tapper cited State Department statistics that show that after the US launched an aid program to El Salvador, homicide rates went down and the number of migrants fleeing to the US dropped as well. Similar results were seen in Honduras and Guatemala, the other two ""Northern Triangle"" countries to which the Trump administration announced April 1 that it will cut aid. Tapper asked Pompeo if the aid cuts were ""self-defeating"" given past results. Disconnect Read More ""Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent,"" said Pompeo, ""and you see the results."" He argued that the US had been ""throwing more money at those problems"" with little impact and there is ""no reason to expect we'll get any different outcome."" When Tapper pointed out that the data showed the aid had a positive impact and that the numbers came from Pompeo's own department, the top US diplomat said, ""I think that President Trump's decision makes perfect sense ... I think the data you describe proves this point."" ""If what you're doing doesn't work,"" Pompeo said, you should stop. Tapper tried again, pointing out that homicides went down and ""fewer people came,"" according to ""your agency's data."" The Obama administration launched an ""Alliance for Prosperity"" initiative in 2014 to respond to a crisis of unaccompanied minors being sent to the US southern border. The goal was to improve security and economic opportunity in those countries to reduce the incentive for migrants to leave and try to enter the US. 'Return on our investment' The US committed $420 million to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador for fiscal year 2017, while the three Northern Triangle countries committed $5.4 billion to support investments public safety and opportunity. The Global Leadership Coalition, an organization of retired military leaders, diplomats and members of Congress, reported that the aid "" not only worked , but also delivered a return on our investment for the American taxpayer."" Homicide rates declined by 42% in El Salvador, 13% in Guatemala, and 23% in Honduras from 2015 to 2017. By 2017, American assistance helped improve security and economic conditions throughout the region, and border-crossing apprehensions had fallen to their lowest point since 1971, the group reports. In fiscal year 2017, the US provided approximately $837 million in foreign assistance to Central America and Mexico for such programs to help them address the root causes of migration including brutal violence, hunger, and instability in communities.

Officials would not say exactly how much money would be affected by the Trump directive and some of it has likely already been spent.

Fisher-Price Rock 'n Play sleepers recalled - CNN,www.cnn.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/fisher-price-rock-n-play-sleeper-recall/index.html,"Fisher-Price Rock 'n Play sleepers recalled as officials confirm over 30 infant deaths By Nicole Chavez, CNN Updated 7:16 PM EDT, Fri April 12, 2019
(CNN) The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission and Fisher-Price are recalling all of the company's Rock 'n Play Sleepers, with the commission linking the product to over 30 infant deaths in 10 years.
The recall will impact about 4.7 million sleepers, the commission said.
""I'm urging parents to stop using this product immediately and to contact Fisher-Price for a refund or a voucher,"" said Ann Marie Buerkle, the CPSC's acting chairwoman. This grieving family wants Fisher-Price's Rock 'n Play sleeper recalled and pediatrics group agrees
Chuck Scothon, general manager at Fisher-Price, said the company considered the recall the ""best course of action"" and will continue to stand by the safety of all its products.
""With these actions, we want parents around the world to know that safety will always be a cornerstone of our mission, that we are committed to these values, and will continue to prioritize the health, safety and well-being of the infants and preschoolers who utilize our products,"" Scothon said.
The decision comes a week after the commission and Fisher-Price issued a warning about the product, prompting calls from the American Academy of Pediatrics and grieving parents for an immediate recall.
The commission said Friday that ""over 30 infant fatalities have occurred in Rock 'n Play Sleepers, after the infants rolled over while unrestrained, or under other circumstances"" since 2009.
The recall did not say what caused the infants' deaths.
Last week, the CPSC had only cited reports of 10 fatalities -- of babies 3 months or older -- but a Consumer Reports analysis linked the popular sleeper to 32 infant deaths, between 2011 and 2018.
Patty Davis, a spokeswoman with CPSC, had said the commission was aware of the report of additional fatalities and were looking into those deaths.
Following Friday's recall, Buerkle said the investigation into the sleepers had been a top priority for the commission and announced that officials will continue looking into other inclined sleep products.
""I urge consumers to report any incidents with inclined sleepers or other nursery products to CPSC at saferproducts.gov,"" she said in a video statement. ""As a mother and grandmother there's nothing more important to me than the safety of our children.""
For more information about the recall, customers can contact Fisher-Price at www.service.mattel.com and click on ""Recalls & Safety Alerts"" or at 866-812-6518 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET Monday through Friday. Their 5-month-old son died in 2017
Keenan and Evan Overton 's son had been sleeping in the product when he died three days before Christmas 2017.
Their son, 5-month-old Ezra, was napping in the sleeper while his father, Keenan Overton, was asleep on the couch next to him.
""I looked up and I found him in a standing position but faced down in the chair, his face was on the back of the seat and he was already passed away. I picked him up and his face was already blue and his nose was squished in,"" Keenan Overton told CNN. Ezra Overton
Ezra wouldn't have been able to roll over yet, Overton said.

Top Chicago prosecutor asks for 'independent review' into handling of Jussie Smollett case - CNN,us.cnn.com,Amir Vera,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/chicago-prosecutor-independent-review/index.html,"(CNN) Kim Foxx, Chicago's top prosecutor, has asked the Cook County inspector general to investigate her office's handling of Jussie Smollett's criminal case, a spokesperson from Foxx's office confirmed Friday.
The Cook County State's Attorney's office dropped 16 felony charges against the ""Empire"" actor, who was accused of staging a hate crime against himself in Chicago. Smollett agreed to forfeit $10,000 in bail and do community service. Inspector General Patrick Blanchard will be conducting the investigation. Why did prosecutors drop all charges against Jussie Smollett? ""Ensuring that I and my office have the community's trust and confidence is paramount to me, which is why I invited an independent review of this matter,"" Foxx said in a statement provided to CNN. ""I welcome this investigation and pledge my full cooperation and the cooperation of my office as IG Blanchard conducts his review."" Blanchard also released a statement confirming his office was ""pursuing an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the resolution of criminal charges in the Smollet case."" Blanchard told CNN Friday that Foxx requested his office review their handling of the Smollett case this week and he has no idea how long that investigation will take. Read More ""We are proceeding immediately with this matter, but it is difficult to forecast the length at this juncture,"" Blanchard said, adding he's never been asked by Foxx to review the findings of a state's attorney's case. He said the report will either be made public directly after the review or addressed in a quarterly report that will be made public. Calls for Foxx's resignation are personal, she says The Chicago Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) and a suburban police chiefs association called for Foxx's resignation after holding votes of no confidence April 4. The vote took place more than a week after Foxx's office dropped all charges against Smollett. FOP President Kevin Graham said dropping the charges undermined the public's faith in the criminal justice system. Chicago prosecutor Kim Foxx says calls for her resignation are personal Days later at an event with Rev. Jesse Jackson, Foxx said calls for her resignation run deeper than the Jussie Smollett case. ""I think we have to ask ourselves what is this really about? I've been asking myself for the last two weeks, 'What is this really about?'"" Foxx said. ""I will tell you this is personal, it's personal."" Foxx has previously said she welcomes an ""outside, nonpolitical review"" into how her office handled the Smollett case. She had separated herself from decision-making in the case in mid-February out of ""an abundance of caution."""
Agriculture secretary: Closing US-Mexico border would have ...,www.cnn.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/11/politics/perdue-mexico-border/index.html,"Agriculture secretary: Closing US-Mexico border would have been 'detrimental' to US commerce Posted 1:47 p.m. Thursday By Gregory Wallace, CNN
CNN — Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said Thursday he is concerned about the idea that the Trump administration would close the US-Mexico border -- a threat President Donald Trump floated and then later backed off on -- which Perdue warned would have been ""detrimental"" to trade.
""I don't see any threat right now to close the border,"" he said at a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing Thursday. ""We've advocated I think as well as others how detrimental this would be to US commerce.""
Perdue was asked by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, about fears from her state's dairy producers, which include retaliatory tariffs from Mexico targeting cheese and other US agricultural products.
""Even with passing comments about closing down ports of entry has got Wisconsin farmers and cheese makers extremely concerned,"" she told Perdue.
The threat from President Donald Trump played out both in public and private over the last month. The President repeatedly warned he'd have the border closed if Mexico did not step up anti-drug trade efforts. Behind the scenes, he ordered officials to close the El Paso port of entry, followed by other ports, replying with indifference to their concerns about the trade impacts of such a move.
Trump later backed off of the public threat to close the border.
Last week, Perdue called the threat ""not helpful"" and ""harmful"" to trade, according to audio and a description of his remarks posted online by his department.
""It's not helpful. It can be certainly harmful from a trade perspective, if trade is included in that shutdown,"" he said. ""I would like to see, certainly, it not affect agricultural trade in that regard, whether its rail or truck, but that may be wishing for too much.""

Louisiana arson suspect expressed disgust with Baptist churches on Facebook,edition.cnn.com,Paul P. Murphy,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/louisiana-church-fires-suspect/index.html,"(CNN) Four days before his arrest in connection with the three Louisiana Baptist church fires, Holden Matthews expressed disgust with Baptist beliefs on Facebook, CNN has learned.
Responding to a post about ""afrikan spirituality,"" Matthews, posting under the name Noctis Matthews, said he cannot ""stand all these baptists around here, bunch of brainwashed people trying to find happiness in a religion that was forced on their ancestors just as it was on mine."" A charred gas can and a debit card led to a suspect in the Louisiana black church fires In the posting, Matthews said he wished that, ""more blacks [sic] people would look into ancient beliefs of pre Christian Africa."" An acquaintance, Nygyl Bryyn, confirmed to CNN the profile and alias is that of Holden Matthews. He says his friend is not racist and believes the churches were, ""victims of circumstances."" All three churches authorities say Matthews burned down were black Baptist churches in the heart of south central Louisiana's Cajun and Creole country. Read More The suspect is the 21-year-old son of a St. Landry Parish sheriff's deputy and may have been influenced by ""black metal"" music and its ""associated history with church burnings,"" the state fire marshal's office said. Authorities say black metal may have influenced the Louisiana church fires suspect. Here's what to know. CNN reached out to Matthews' lawyer and the prosecutor's office but have not yet received a response. When CNN asked authorities if they were aware of the posting, they said because the investigation was ongoing they would not detail any particular leads they are following. While the motive is still under investigation, authorities said that Matthews' interest in black metal music may have influenced his behavior. Black metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music that typically takes on anti-Christian, satanic and pagan themes. The black metal songs typically have a fast tempo and feature shrieking vocals, heavily distorted guitars and unconventional song structures. A song from the suspect's band, Pagan Carnage, referenced church burnings. Their church was burning. They linked arms and prayed The day after police say Matthews burned down St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, a video was posted on his band's YouTube page of his song, ""Diabolical Soul Feast."" ""The holy church is now destroyed,"" Matthews screams in the final lyrics of the song. ""Burning down in Odin's name."" Bryyn says that Matthews writes and performs the song. The motive for the fires is still under investigation, and federal officials are looking into whether a hate crime was committed. Matthews is charged with three counts of simple arson on a religious building. Greater Union was among three historically black churches in rural St. Landry Parish, west of Baton Rouge, that police said were intentionally torched over a 10-day span. St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, located about six miles southeast of Greater Union, burned first on March 26. Greater Union Baptist was set ablaze on April 2. Mount Pleasant Baptist Church burned on April 4."
Appeals court puts hold on order blocking policy that forces some asylum seekers to remain in Mexico - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,"Tammy Kupperman, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/trump-administration-asylum-seekers-mexico/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A federal appeals court on Friday night temporarily put on hold a federal judge's order blocking the Trump administration's policy to return some asylum seekers to Mexico during their immigration proceedings.
The order on sending asylum seekers back to Mexico was slated to go into effect Friday. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals put the order on hold while it considers the government's emergency motion appealing Judge Richard Seeborg's preliminary injunction. The three-judge panel -- made up of two judges appointed by Democratic presidents and one appointed by a Republican -- considering the case for the 9th Circuit has asked for the groups that filed a lawsuit to block the policy to file a brief by Tuesday, and the government can file its reply by 12 p.m. ET Wednesday. The Migrant Protection Protocols program, informally known as ""Remain in Mexico,"" was initially rolled out at the San Ysidro port of entry in January. Up to 400 people have been returned to Mexico under the policy, according to a Department of Homeland Security official. Read More Seeborg's preliminary injunction halting the policy was a major blow to then-outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. She recently ordered that the policy be expanded along the southern border in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants to the border."
It cost Facebook $22 million to keep Mark Zuckerberg safe last year,edition.cnn.com,Heather Kelly,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/tech/mark-zuckerberg-security/index.html,"San Francisco (CNN Business) Keeping Mark Zuckerberg safe is expensive.
Facebook paid its CEO an additional $13 million for his personal security and travel costs in 2018, according to a proxy filing on Friday. That included a new $10 million pre-tax allowance for additional security costs such as security guards, equipment, services and residential improvements. ""He is synonymous with Facebook and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,"" said the filing. Like many wealthy CEOs, Zuckerberg receives an official salary of $1 a year. He also did not receive bonuses or stock awards in 2018. However, Zuckerberg's total compensation jumped from $9.1 million in 2017 to $22.6 million in 2018 in order to cover the increase in security costs for the high-profile CEO. The increase is partially the result of specific threats against Zuckerberg and Facebook's ( FB ) high visibility, according to the company. Read More Reed Hastings to depart Facebook's board as competition with Netflix heats up Facebook pays for Zuckerberg and his family's personal security at his homes and when he travels. Approximately $2.6 million of Zuckerberg's compensation package in 2018 was for private aircraft travel, which the company said was part of the security program. The company is entering the second year of a seemingly non-stop series of scandals . It has been under fire for everything from personal privacy issues following revelations that data-firm Cambridge Analytica collected information on 87 million Facebook users, to enabling the spread of white supremacy and hate speech on the platform. Those events have drawn a large amount of exposure for the company and its 34-year-old co-founder. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg runs with bodyguards in Germany in 2016. ""Mr. Zuckerberg is one of the most-recognized executives in the world, in large part as a result of the size of our user base and our continued exposure to global media, legislative, and regulatory attention,"" said the filing. The filing said Facebook also increased the amount of money it put towards COO Sheryl Sandberg's personal security by $1.1 million. Zuckerberg is one of the richest people in the world and is worth just over $70 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire's index."
Hill prepares to settle for Shanahan at DOD - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,Michael Warren,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/shanahan-pentagon-trump-replacement/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Acting Defense secretary Patrick Shanahan remains President Donald Trump's top pick to be the permanent head of the Pentagon, say multiple sources in Congress and the administration. But with questions about whether he will make the cut, the administration is left with a daunting question: Does anyone actually want the job?
Several Republicans on Capitol Hill tell CNN they're concerned about Shanahan's ability to get through Senate confirmation. There's also a fear over a lack of willing alternatives for one of the most difficult Cabinet jobs. ""It's hard to find someone to take it,"" one senior Republican in Congress has told CNN. Shanahan is under investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general over possible ethics violations. A Boeing employee for more than three decades before joining the Pentagon in 2017 as Deputy Defense Secretary under then Defense Secretary James Mattis, Shanahan has been accused by a federal watchdog group of promoting his former company and disparaging its competitors internally. Even before the investigation began last month, delaying Shanahan's anticipated nomination for the permanent position, Republicans on the Hill were concerned about his fitness for the job. ""He has not impressed anybody on the Hill,"" said one Republican congressional aide said of Shanahan. ""I've not heard a single person defend this pick."" No alternatives Read More Given the lack of enthusiasm among key Republicans for Shanahan, a number of names have been floated as a permanent successor, including Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, former Missouri senator Jim Talent, Secretary of the Army Mark Esper, and Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry. None have publicly expressed interest in the job, and there is rising concern among some Republicans on the Hill that none of the qualified alternatives actually want the job. A spokesman for Cotton, who has been a staunch ally of the President's and advises him on the military and national security, declined to comment on whether the Arkansas Republican would be interested in the job. Kevin Bishop, a spokesman for Graham, told CNN the South Carolina senator has ""zero interest in any Cabinet position."" When asked if Thornberry, the top-ranking Republican on the House Armed Services, would consider being Defense Secretary, a spokesman pointed to the Texas congressman's ""scoff"" at a similar question from a journalist last December. A spokesman for Esper also pointed to a December statement on the question from the Army secretary. ""I'm very happy and privileged to be secretary of the Army,"" he told the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram . A spokesperson for Talent, who served in the Senate from 2002 to 2007, did not reply to a request for comment. Not only would a new nominee have less than two years guaranteed to do the job, there is also trepidation about taking on one of the most difficult Cabinet positions in a frequently dysfunctional administration. Mattis's clashes with President Trump over the decision to withdraw from Syria, which precipitated his resignation last year, offer a cautionary tale. So do the mixed messages from the administration on the withdrawal from Syria and Afghanistan. A permanent Defense secretary could be turned out of office in 2021 if Trump loses re-election. Shanahan's stumbles Despite him being under investigation, Shanahan's lengthy tenure -- at more than 100 days, he is the longest acting Defense secretary in history -- and the dearth of willing alternatives has given him an air of inevitability around Washington. Multiple administration officials tell CNN that Shanahan expects to be cleared by a current ethics investigation and expects to be nominated for the top job. And the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee says he expects the former Boeing executive, who has now served more than 100 days as the acting Pentagon chief, to get the nod. ""I want a permanent replacement,"" Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma told CNN Thursday. ""I want him. If it's not going to be him, I want somebody else. But I want him right now. He's the one that's in mind. We're long past the point where we should have an acting in that position."" Since January, Trump has been leaning toward nominating him to take the job permanently, but the President refrained from doing so before the inspector general's office began its investigation in March. Two administration officials claimed the initial delay was due to a backlog of other acting positions that needed permanent nominations. But a Republican aide on Capitol Hill says there were also concerns about getting enough support for Shanahan in the Senate. ""I think he's going to have some trouble on the confirmation side,"" said the aide. Defense-focused Republicans in Washington have been worried for months that Shanahan's problems go beyond potential ethical lapses. ""He's totally underwhelming,"" said a former Pentagon official from the George W. Bush administration who remains active in defense policy. In multiple meetings with Shanahan, the person said he came away with the impression that Shanahan lacked key qualifications, particularly on the foreign policy front. Members of Congress have also grumbled about Shanahan's performance in hearings, saying he's come across as not conversant with the details of defense policy. Two administration officials acknowledge that Shanahan has faced a learning curve when it comes to interacting with lawmakers. But they add Shanahan, an engineer by training, has improved from his first hearings at the Senate and House Armed Services committees in March, to his most recent trip to Capitol Hill at Thursday's Senate hearing on Space Force. He still seemed to struggle at times on Thursday, particularly compared to his more seasoned colleagues who joined him on the panel. Early on at this most recent hearing -- which also featured Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, Gen. John E. Hyten of Strategic Command, and Gen. James Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as witnesses -- Chairman Inhofe posed what he called a ""direct question"" to Shanahan. ""How would establishing a Space Force help the United States reassert its warfighting dominance?"" Inhofe asked. Shanahan's answer wasn't exactly direct. ""The fix -- I think what you're really speaking to is: how do we expand that margin?"" he began. ""Our proposal addresses all of the changes that are occurring simultaneously in space. And maybe just to set up the answer, these are the significant changes we have to address. The environment is contested, we are about to modernize -- for the first time in about 30 years, modernize the Department."" As Shanahan went on, Inhofe interjected, ""Yes, quickly now,"" prompting the defense chief to cut the answer short so the chairman could ask a similar question to Wilson. ""I do think that there is an opportunity to align defense space programs in a Space Force underneath the Air Force, including acquisition. And I think that that alignment will help,"" said Wilson succinctly. ""Okay,"" Inhofe said. ""That's a good answer."" But Inhofe denied he had any concerns about Shanahan's performance. ""Better than he did the first hearing he attended,"" he told CNN after the hearing. ""So I thought he did a very good job, answered the questions correctly. Didn't make any obvious mistakes."" "
"Roger Stone linked to matters still under investigation, Justice Dept. says",edition.cnn.com,Katelyn Polantz,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/roger-stone-justice-department-investigation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Longtime Donald Trump ally Roger Stone is connected to investigations Robert Mueller sent to other prosecutors and that continue despite the special counsel having finished his work, the Justice Department said Friday in a new court filing.
The Justice Department told the federal court in Washington, DC, on Friday afternoon that it shouldn't allow the public release of search warrants being used in Stone's criminal case in DC federal court. The warrants ""concern investigations that remain ongoing,"" the filing says. There's so much sensitive information still in the search warrants that they should not even be released with redactions, the Justice Department argues. ""Because of the interconnected nature of the Special Counsel's investigations, the category of materials here sweeps more broadly than Stone and the specific crimes with which he has been charged,"" the prosecutors wrote. ""Although the Special Counsel has concluded his investigation, the requested materials concern investigations that remain ongoing, a trial in (Stone's case) that is scheduled for later this year, and the privacy interests of uncharged third parties. No right of public access applies to such materials,"" the prosecutors said. A media coalition, including CNN, had asked to unseal the Stone warrants. Prosecutors even gave a hypothetical about ongoing investigations, saying it's possible a defendant gets charged with a crime but still has other conduct and communication with others under investigation. Read More ""The Special Counsel's investigation has involved multiple lines of inquiry. Many have been handled in the Special Counsel's Office. But the Special Counsel has also referred a number of matters to other offices in the government for investigation,"" the prosecutors added. Stone was charged with lying, obstruction and witness intimidation related to his statements to Congress about his attempts to interact with WikiLeaks about stolen documents in 2016. Russian military agents were separately charged by Mueller for the alleged hack of the Democrats. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested in London on Thursday and charged with a conspiracy computer crime, but it did not touch on the 2016 hack or WikiLeaks' publication of those documents."
Kratom deaths: CDC study finds the drug was a cause in nearly 100 deaths - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Harmeet Kaur,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/health/kratom-deaths-cdc-study/index.html,"(CNN) A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that kratom was a cause of death in nearly 100 people over a 17-month period -- a higher number than previously reported.
The CDC analyzed reports of more than 27,000 unintentional drug overdoses across 32 states and Washington, D.C. The study said 152 of those people were found to have kratom in their system, and the drug was a cause of death for 91 of them. Earlier this year, the US Food and Drug Administration said that 44 deaths had been associated with the drug. About 80% of the people in the CDC study who had kratom in their system had a history of substance misuse. Almost all of them also had other substances in their system. Read More The other substances most commonly found were fentanyl, heroin, benzodiazepines (also known as tranquilizers), prescription opioids and cocaine. The number of people whose deaths were associated with kratom make up less than 1% of all overdose deaths. The report's authors say it's possible the numbers might be underestimated, although they can't say to what extent. Health officials have warned about kratom According to the American Kratom Association, nearly five million Americans consume kratom safely each year. The Southeast Asian plant is sold in pills, capsules and extracts. Some people brew the leaves as a tea, while others chew or smoke them. At low doses, kratom acts like a stimulant. At higher doses, it sedates dulling pain -- which has made it a popular over-the-counter remedy for opioid withdrawal. She drank kratom tea while pregnant. Then her newborn went into withdrawal But health officials have urged caution. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb likened the chemical compounds in kratom to opioids and said there was no evidence to indicate that it was safe or effective for ""any medical use."" He also cited concerns about its potential for abuse. ""Kratom should not be used to treat medical conditions, nor should it be used as an alternative to prescription opioids,"" Gottlieb said in a statement in 2018. The Drug Enforcement Administration lists kratom as a drug of concern but dropped a plan to classify it as a controlled substance after public outcry in 2016. US poison control centers saw the number of calls about kratom exposures increase from 13 in 2011 to 682 in 2017, often for serious unanticipated effects of the supplement, according to a study published earlier this year. ""Individuals who choose to use kratom need to be aware of the potential risks. Just because it is currently classified as an herbal supplement does not mean that it is regulated or that it is safe,"" Henry Spiller, director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children's Hospital, said in a statement in February. Researchers question the FDA's warnings Some scientists who study kratom disagree with the FDA's 2018 warning about the drug's potential for abuse. Scott Hemby, who chairs the Department of Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences at High Point University in North Carolina, researches ""addictiveness"" of kratom and spoke to CNN after the FDA issued its warning. Compounds in herbal supplement kratom are opioids, FDA says He found that two chemicals in kratom, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, can bond to the body's opioid receptors and act very much like opioids do, providing some pain relief and causing a release of dopamine. But it's at a much more toned-down level than prescription pills or heroin. Hemby did find that 7-hydroxymitragynine may have some addictive qualities, but when looking at kratom as a whole, the ratio of that element is so small that the drug has very low abuse potential, he told CNN."
Top Chicago prosecutor asks for 'independent review' into handling of Jussie Smollett case - CNN,www.cnn.com,Amir Vera,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/chicago-prosecutor-independent-review/index.html,"(CNN) Kim Foxx, Chicago's top prosecutor, has asked the Cook County inspector general to investigate her office's handling of Jussie Smollett's criminal case, a spokesperson from Foxx's office confirmed Friday.
The Cook County State's Attorney's office dropped 16 felony charges against the ""Empire"" actor, who was accused of staging a hate crime against himself in Chicago. Smollett agreed to forfeit $10,000 in bail and do community service. Inspector General Patrick Blanchard will be conducting the investigation. Why did prosecutors drop all charges against Jussie Smollett? ""Ensuring that I and my office have the community's trust and confidence is paramount to me, which is why I invited an independent review of this matter,"" Foxx said in a statement provided to CNN. ""I welcome this investigation and pledge my full cooperation and the cooperation of my office as IG Blanchard conducts his review."" Blanchard also released a statement confirming his office was ""pursuing an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the resolution of criminal charges in the Smollet case."" Blanchard told CNN Friday that Foxx requested his office review their handling of the Smollett case this week and he has no idea how long that investigation will take. Read More ""We are proceeding immediately with this matter, but it is difficult to forecast the length at this juncture,"" Blanchard said, adding he's never been asked by Foxx to review the findings of a state's attorney's case. He said the report will either be made public directly after the review or addressed in a quarterly report that will be made public. Calls for Foxx's resignation are personal, she says The Chicago Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) and a suburban police chiefs association called for Foxx's resignation after holding votes of no confidence April 4. The vote took place more than a week after Foxx's office dropped all charges against Smollett. FOP President Kevin Graham said dropping the charges undermined the public's faith in the criminal justice system. Chicago prosecutor Kim Foxx says calls for her resignation are personal Days later at an event with Rev. Jesse Jackson, Foxx said calls for her resignation run deeper than the Jussie Smollett case. ""I think we have to ask ourselves what is this really about? I've been asking myself for the last two weeks, 'What is this really about?'"" Foxx said. ""I will tell you this is personal, it's personal."" Foxx has previously said she welcomes an ""outside, nonpolitical review"" into how her office handled the Smollett case. She had separated herself from decision-making in the case in mid-February out of ""an abundance of caution."" "

Police in Dominican Republic recover car used by couple who went missing,edition.cnn.com,Rosa Flores,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/americas/dominican-missing-couple/index.html,"(CNN) The car used by a New York tourists who went missing last month has been recovered off the coast of the Dominican Republic, police said Friday.
Authorities extracted a car from the area where Orlando Moore and Portia Ravenelle went missing on March 27, according to Col. Frank Felix Duran Mejia. The vehicle identification number of the car pulled from the Caribbean Sea matches the number of the car Moore and Ravenelle had rented, according to Duran Mejia. Police confirm that a woman who died after 8 days in a Dominican Republic ICU was a missing New York tourist Video provided to CNN by Dominican Republic National Police show the extraction of the vehicle. From the images, it's difficult to discern the make and model of the car. Read More Upholstery, cables and other debris appear to dangle from the car as it was pulled from the sea. Locals describe that zone as ""la batidora"" -- the blender -- because of the rough seas normally found in the area. Duran Mejia said a black iPhone was also recovered. It's unclear where the phone was found in relation to the car. Searchers recover a black iPhone from the waters where the couple went missing. A photo provided to CNN by Dominican Republic National Police showed the back of the phone was shattered. The word ""iPhone"" is clearly visible. The agency is tracing the phone to figure out if it belongs to Moore or Ravenelle. The National Police believe the car with Ravenelle, 52, and Moore, 40, plunged not long after the pair left for the airport to catch a flight home to New York. Detectives spoke to fishermen who said they heard a loud noise coming from 19 kilometers (about 11.8 miles) away from the freeway of Las Americas, Santo Domingo Este early that morning, the National Police said. The fishermen said they found a woman who was seriously injured and not carrying any identification, police said. If she had known her friend was in a Dominican Republic ICU, she could have held her hand before she died She was taken by ambulance to the hospital with severe trauma and contusions to the head, hospital spokesman Dario Mañon said. Ravenelle died April 4, before she was in a condition in which hospital officials could take her photo and share it with the media, he said. Mañon told CNN that no family or friends had called the hospital looking for Ravenelle. The fishermen also reported seeing a vehicle at the bottom of the sea, but because of rough conditions, divers had not been able to identify the vehicle, Durán Mejia said. Crews waited days for the seas to calm to begin their search. On March 31, the body of a man fitting the description of Moore was found at sea near Sans Souci, Durán Mejia said. Police are still working to identify the body they believe is Moore's, but they say they are sure both bodies of the missing pair have been found. Authorities are hoping Moore's brother can identify him by photographs of his tattoos. One of his tattoos, on the right arm, reads ""Milan."" Moore's friend, Francesca Figueroa, told CNN she confirmed to the police that Moore has a tattoo with his daughter's name, ""Milan,"" on his arm. People gathered at the extraction site. Moore and Ravenelle were friends who worked together and decided to take a trip to the Dominican Republic, Figueroa said. They arrived in the country March 24. Cheryl Freeman said she and her boyfriend spent time with Moore and Ravenelle while on vacation in the resort town of Samana. Freeman said Moore and Ravenelle had a 2 a.m. flight and were driving a rental car to the airport. Ravenelle repeatedly asked Moore if he was sure they had enough gas to make it to the airport, Freeman said. She kept checking to make sure their phones were charged enough to use the GPS, Freeman said. The two were due back in New York on March 27, but airport surveillance shows they never made it into the airport building. Police now believe an accident caused them to drive off the freeway and into the sea. Authorities said there was no evidence of foul play. The case has not been closed, and Durán Mejia said there are still many unanswered questions around the circumstances of the accident."
"Family separations crisis isn't over, but one milestone is close - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Catherine E. Shoichet,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/family-separations-update/index.html,"(CNN) Just one child from a separated migrant family who's eligible for reunification remains in government custody, officials said in a court filing Friday night -- though the family separations crisis is far from over.
RELATED: 'Zero tolerance' a year later: How the US family separations crisis erupted The filing, a regular status update submitted as part of the American Civil Liberties Union's lawsuit over separations of undocumented immigrant families, indicates that officials have made major headway in the court-ordered reunification process after months of efforts to track down hundreds of parents who were deported without their children. But officials are gearing up for a new push to identify potentially thousands more separated families, and they've said it could take them two years to do that. The latest on reunification efforts Read More The reunification process for the child who remains in custody could still take time, officials said Friday, as they're awaiting word on whether the parent wants to be reunified. ""Currently, there is one child in (Office of Refugee Resettlement) care proceeding toward reunification or other appropriate discharge,"" the filing said. ""This child has a parent who departed from the United States, but the Steering Committee has advised that resolution of parental preference will be delayed."" More than 40 other children from separated families remain in government custody, but officials say those children won't be reunited with their parents, either because the parents waived reunification or because the parents were deemed unfit or a danger. A total of 2,162 children from separated families have been reunified with their parents, the court filing said. The next phase An explosive government watchdog report in January revealed there could be thousands more families who were separated at the border but weren't previously acknowledged by the government. And last month US District Judge Dana Sabraw ruled that those families should be included in the class action lawsuit over family separations. The government first detailed its proposed plan for identifying these previously unacknowledged families a week ago, outlining a strategy for piecing together exactly who might have been separated by combing through thousands of records using a mix of data analysis and manual review. In this Friday's court filing, the government said it had begun an ""expedited procurement process"" to hire contractors to help with that effort ""if necessary,"" including three data scientists and at least 10 contractors to work full time manually reviewing case files. The proposed plan for identifying additional separated families has drawn sharp criticism from the ACLU, which has accused officials of dragging their feet. Before a hearing scheduled for next week, the ACLU says, it plans to submit to the court ""specific reasons why the government does not need two years and how the identification process can be completed in far less time."""
Kim says US must stop 'current way of calculation' to continue nuke talks - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Sophie Jeong,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/kim-jong-un-donald-trump-nuclear-talks/index.html,"Seoul (CNN) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is calling on the US to stop ""its current way of calculation"" if it is interested in continuing diplomatic talks, according to a report from the country's state news agency KCNA.
""First of all, it is necessary for the United States to stop the current way of calculation and approach us with a new way of calculation,"" Kim said in Pyongyang at the first meeting of the 14th session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, KCNA reports. ""What is obvious is that if the United States sticks to the current political way of calculation, the prospects for problem solving will be dark and very dangerous."" In February, President Donald Trump cut short his Hanoi, Vietnam, summit with Kim with no joint agreement or statement after Kim insisted all US sanctions be lifted from his country. Since the tense summit, North Korea has threatened to suspend denuclearization talks with the United States. Trump says sanctions on North Korea are at a 'fair level' Trump, during an Oval Office meeting with his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, left open the door to a third summit with Kim but said it's up to the North Korean dictator. The US President said he wants sanctions on North Korea to remain in place, though he doesn't want to increase them. Read More In his speech Friday, Kim said, ""The United States is talking a lot about holding a third US-NK summit meeting, but we are neither pleased nor willing to see a summit like the Hanoi summit reenacted."" He added, ""But as President Trump continues to mention, the personal relations between me and President Trump are not as hostile as the relations between the two countries, and we still have a good relationship, and if we want, we can send and receive letters asking for each other's regards any time."" The North Korean leader added that if the US were to ask for a third summit, it would be ""with the condition that the US has the right attitude and finds a methodology that can be shared with us, we would be willing to try one more time."" Kim said he will ""be patient"" and wait until the end of this year for the US to decide if it wants another summit. ""But it will be hard to get a good opportunity like the last time again,"" he said. Responding to the comments from the North Korean leader, South Korea's presidential office said in a message to journalists in Seoul on Saturday, ""Our government will do what we can in order to maintain the current momentum for dialogue and help negotiations between the US and North Korea resume at an early date."""
Indian elections: Kashmiri voters speak out as violence continues - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Sugam Pokharel and Nikhil Kumar,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/india/uri-kashmir-goes-to-the-polls-intl/index.html,"Uri, Indian-controlled Kashmir (CNN) Kashmir resident Gulam Rasul has seen it all: Two wars between India and Pakistan which were sparked by the disputed region as well as dozens of other armed conflicts.
Over the years, he's given up dreaming for peace. ""If you can't give us peace, give us the bunkers at least,"" says the 76-year-old, who lives in the town of Uri in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Uri sits perilously close to the Line of Control, the de facto border that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan. As a result, locals say, the town and surrounding villages are frequently caught in the crossfire when the two sides fire shells at each other -- a common problem that's worsened in the aftermath of an aerial dogfight in late February. Kashmir resident Gulam Rasul has given up dreaming of peace. ""We want the bunkers so that we have a place to hide during intense shelling. We don't have anywhere to go and no means to protect ourselves. This is injustice,"" Rasul says. India's main political parties, according to Rasul, are ignoring the area's real problem -- unemployment -- and instead are just using the Kashmir issue for political gain, especially in the run-up to a nationwide election which got underway earlier this week. An Indian soldier guards as Kashmiri voters queue up to cast their votes outside a polling station at Shadipora, outskirts of Srinagar, in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Read More Apart from the regular cross-border shelling, there are constant clashes between local militant groups and Indian troops and police. The relentless cycle of violence has a severe impact on daily lives, with the cost of essential supplies rocketing during flare-ups. ""Living here is expensive. Dying here is extremely cheap,"" Rasul says. Local political activist Nadim Abbasi organizes protests aimed at bringing these issues to light. On his mobile, he shows photos of Reyaz Ahmad, who was critically injured when a shell hit his house in a border village near Uri in early March. The 32-year-old had to have his legs amputated and died in hospital two weeks later. The town of Uri in Indian controlled Kashmir, close to the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that divides this disputed region between India and Pakistan. ""A bunker could have saved his life,"" Abbasi says. For vegetable seller Nadim Khan, 75, the cross-border shelling is nothing out of the ordinary. ""Coming here must be exotic for foreign journalists like you, right?"" Khan says mockingly. ""This is an everyday reality for us. I grew up seeing this, and I'll die seeing this. The situation will be the same for generations to come. Nothing will change. I don't worry about it anymore. I will die the day and the way Allah wishes,"" Khan adds. India and Pakistan each control part of mainly Muslim Kashmir but each claim the region in its entirety. A revolt since 1989 in the Indian section, by groups seeking independence or union with Pakistan, has claimed thousands of lives. The impact of the conflict isn't confined to the border area -- it reverberates across Kashmir including Srinagar, the main city in the Indian-controlled section. Protesters say violence in Kashmir has a severe impact on their daily lives. When CNN visited in March, the city center resembled a ghost town. Local separatist groups had called for a shutdown after a teacher arrested for alleged terror links died in police custody. Schools and businesses were closed, and streets were deserted except for police or troops on every corner -- not an unusual sight for Srinagar residents. For visitors, the city is one of juxtaposing realities: A mesmerizing landscape, with a backdrop of tall mountains, in what is one of the most heavily militarized places on Earth. Last year was the bloodiest in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir in a decade: 238 militants died while 86 police or troops and 37 civilians lost their lives. 2017 was hardly less deadly. Life goes on in Uri, despite the frequent shelling. The death in 2016 of Burhan Wani, an influential young militant leader, sparked a wave of unrest that has claimed scores of civilian lives and left thousands injured. Many were partially or fully blinded by the use of pellet guns, a controversial move by Indian security forces to quell protests. The separatist insurgency and the frequent quarrels between India and Pakistan have hit the local tourism industry hard. Some 12.5 million tourists visited Jammu and Kashmir in 2012, a figure which dropped to 7.3 million in 2017. Tourists used to start flocking to the region in early spring. Tourists used to start flocking to the region in early spring. Not anymore. The houseboats on the idyllic Dal Lake -- one of the most popular destinations in Srinagar -- sit empty and dozens of boatmen on the shores wait desperately for customers. Hotel taxi driver Mohammad Shafi complains that he didn't have a single customer for a couple of weeks in early March, when India and Pakistan were on the brink of war. ""The tulip gardens of Srinagar are expected to be in full bloom in a few weeks...Inshallah (God willing), the tourists will start coming again soon,"" he says hopefully."

Beresheet: Israeli spacecraft crashed due to technical glitch - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Nicole Chavez,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/12/middleeast/israel-moon-spacecraft-beresheet/index.html,"(CNN) Beresheet, an unmanned Israeli spacecraft, crashed during an attempt to land on the moon due to a technical glitch, said SpaceIL, the Israeli nonprofit that launched it, citing preliminary data.
In a series of tweets Friday, the company behind the $100 million spacecraft said its engineers believe a technical glitch caused the main engine to shut down and later ""made it impossible to slow the spacecraft's descent."" Israeli spacecraft crashes in final moments before moon landing The spacecraft's first technical issue occurred at 14 kilometers (about 8.7 miles) above the moon, SpaceIL officials said. The Beresheet then lost communications with the control room in Israel during the landing sequence. ""At 150 meters when the connection with #Beresheet was lost, it was moving at 500 km/h, making a collision inevitable,"" the company tweeted. Engineers were able to restart communications with the spacecraft but officials said it was too late -- it was already moving too fast to land properly. Read More The Beresheet was the first privately funded moon mission. Its name was a reference to the first words of the Bible in Hebrew, which translates to ""In the beginning."" The spacecraft was launched into space in February and went on a seven-week journey to reach the moon. It circled the Earth multiple times before being ""slingshoted"" to the moon, traveling about 4 million miles in the process. But it crashed in the final moments before making a soft, controlled landing on the moon. The Israeli team was trying to become the fourth national space agency to make a controlled landing on the moon. Only teams from the United States, the former Soviet Union and China have done it before. If the Israeli team had been successful, it would have been the first private enterprise to make a controlled landing, with the smallest spacecraft and the smallest budget. Israel's privately funded moon mission lifts off Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, known for his Apollo 11 moonwalk, sent a message of support to the Beresheet team. ""Condolences to the Beresheet lander @TeamSpaceIL for what almost was!

College admission scandal was a surprise to everyone but educators - CNN,www.cnn.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/11/us/cheating-scandal-no-surprise-trnd/index.html,"The college admissions scandal was a surprise to everyone but educators By David Williams, CNN Updated 7:33 AM EDT, Fri April 12, 2019
(CNN) Most parents wouldn't dream of committing fraud, bribery or other crimes to help their kids get ahead, but a veteran educator says there's no shortage of moms and dads who are willing to bend or ignore school rules to do what they think is best for their child.
Dozens of parents, including actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin , are accused of using their wealth to cheat on standardized tests and bribe coaches and administrators in an effort to get their children into elite universities.
""Everybody's just so surprised about this,"" Gerry Brooks said in a video that's been seen on Facebook more than 5.5 million times since it was posted Tuesday evening . ""You know who's not surprised? Every educator in the whole world. Do you know why? Because this kind of thing happens every day in schools.""
Brooks, a principal in Lexington, Kentucky, is known for his comedy videos that make light of the issues educators face and has just written a book called ""Go See the Principal.""
In an interview with CNN, Brooks said teachers have to deal with parents who let their kids skip doing homework, sneak sodas and other forbidden foods into their lunch boxes or drive around traffic cones to save a few seconds in the carpool line.
""This happens all the time. We know it's wrong, we know we don't like it, we don't like it when someone breaks a rule at school, but it's something that we deal with on a regular basis,"" he said.
Obviously, Brooks said, breaking the law is far more serious than not following school rules, but it sends the same message.
""It's not on the same scale in any way shape or form,"" Brooks told CNN. ""But it is telling our students that 'there's a rule there and I don't think that rule applies to me, so we're not going to follow that rule.'""
In the video, Brooks holds up a magazine featuring a picture of Huffman and Loughlin, who he refers to as ""Aunt Becky,"" after her role in the sitcom ""Full House.""
""I sent in fast food with my child because it's their birthday, I know we're not supposed to, but I disagree with that school rule that we shouldn't be able to send fast food in for their lunches,"" he said, quoting an imaginary parent. ""You know who else disagrees with school rules? Aunt Becky.""
""At what point do you say that it's okay to sign a planner saying that your child read a book when they didn't, as opposed to helping a student on a test so they can get in college?""
The video has been shared more than 80,000 times and many teachers posted their own ""Aunt Becky"" moments in the comments.
""Guess who makes a right turn from the left lane?....Aunt Becky,"" one commenter said
""This is spot on. The Aunt Becky parents are ruining their kids. I teach at the high school level, and it's getting more ridiculous every year!"" one teacher wrote.
""Parent says the child is sick. Child comes to school the next day and tells how much fun it was at Disneyland,"" another wrote.
Brooks said he did get negative feedback for criticizing parents for lying about where they live, so their kids can go to better schools, or get on the best sports teams.
He said he can't blame people for wanting to get their children out of an unsafe situation.
""If I was in a school where I felt like my child was unsafe, I couldn't afford to go to a different neighborhood, would I think twice about that? Absolutely,"" he said.
He said that's a totally different situation than the families in the cheating scandal faced.
""Here's the deal with them. Those children were going to be able to get into a college, they just weren't getting into the college that the parent wanted them to. It's a whole lot different to say that my child's able to get into a school where they feel safe,"" he said. "

Uber filed to go public, but it's got a few more items to check off before it gets to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange, likely sometime in early May.
Road show: Uber will present its financial information to potential investors, who will decide whether they want to participate in the initial public offering.

Driver classification: 60,000 drivers who had entered into arbitration agreements have filed, or said they plan to file, demands asserting that they have been misclassified as independent contractors. Uber agreed to a $20 million settlement with thousands of drivers in Massachusetts and California earlier this year over a similar claim.

Companies are obligated to tell investors why giving them money might be a risky proposition. Uber, which has never turned a profit and said it may never earn any money, could be a particularly risky company to invest in. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve profitability.
Uber has said this before, but it is spending like crazy to stay ahead of the competition, expand into new cities and develop driverless cars. Those aren't cheap, and Uber said it may never turn a profit. Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees instead of independent contractors.
Uber really wants to keep its drivers classified as contractors, because it doesn't have to pay them benefits. But drivers, activists and some lawmakers have pushed for Uber drivers to gain employee status . Failure to rehabilitate our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.
Uber's sexual assault and harassment crises and its workplace culture problems have clouded the public's view of the company.

Tennessee wants to make it harder to hold voter registration drives - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Harmeet Kaur,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/tennessee-voter-registration-drive-bill-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Tennessee has one of the lowest voter registration rates in the country, according to Pew's Election Performance Index. Soon, it could get a lot harder to help people there register to vote.
Tennessee has a registration rate of 78.52%. While that would be a passing grade at school, it puts Tennessee at 45th among the 50 states for its voter registration rate. A bill currently making its way through the Tennessee legislature would impose new restrictions on groups that hold voter registration drives and subject them to potential jail time and massive fines. Under one of the provisions, individuals or organizations that submit 100 to 500 ""deficient"" voter registration applications, meaning forms that are incomplete or contain incorrect information, could be hit with a $150 to $2,000 fine. Submitting more than 500 ""deficient"" forms could result in a fine of up to $10,000. Forms would have to be delivered or mailed within 10 days of being collected, or by the state's voter registration deadline. Tennessee cuts off voter registration at 30 days before election day. Read More The bill would also make it more difficult to hold a voter registration drive in the first place. Voters cast their ballots at Franklin Community of Faith Church of the Nazarene on November 6, 2018. (Brandon Dill for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Before holding a drive, an organization registering 100 or more people would have to: provide the county elections coordinator with contact information for the people conducting the drive, notify the coordinator about where the drive is being held, complete voter registration training through the elections coordinator and file a sworn statement stating it'll abide by all voter registration laws and procedures. Violating any of those rules ""intentionally and knowingly"" would constitute a Class A misdemeanor -- the most serious misdemeanor, punishable by up to 11 months and 29 days in jail and/or a fine of up to $2,500. The rules wouldn't apply to volunteers who sign up voters or to organizations that rely solely on volunteers to register voters. But the law is vague about what organizations count as having paid staff. In the Tennessee state Senate, the bill has made its way through local and state committee and has been referred to the calendar committee for scheduling. In the state House, it has advanced through committees and is on the calendar for April 15. Scholars and civil rights groups raise alarm Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett, whose office is behind the legislation, wrote in an op-ed for the Tennessean that the law is intended to preserve the integrity of the election process. ""While we strive to register Tennesseans to vote, it must be done responsibly and in a manner that does not compromise the security of elections,"" Hargett wrote. ""Groups that seek to register large numbers of voters, while typically doing so with good intentions, potentially put legitimate voter registrations at risk."" But scholars and civil rights groups argue that the law targets disenfranchised communities and say it would have a chilling effect on those trying to help others vote. ""Voter registration drives have long been used to empower communities that are historically disenfranchised, including students, immigrants, people of color and seniors,"" Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee told CNN. ""This legislation would inhibit access to the ballot and undermine civic engagement."" Discriminatory voter laws have surged in last 5 years, federal commission finds Sekou Franklin, a professor of political science at Middle Tennessee State University, called the proposed law ""draconian"" and said it was a response to heightened mobilization among African-American voters in the last election. ""You don't jail people for trying to politically participate in a democratic way unless you have other motives,"" Franklin said. Franklin said he was troubled that individuals and organizations could potentially incur fines for inconsistencies or errors in voter registration forms. ""There's always deficient applications,"" Franklin said. ""If you're an organization and you register three or four thousand voters, and you have 100 deficient applications, that could be a $10,000 hit. That's a one percent rate."" In his op-ed, Hargett wrote that deficient applications cost the two largest counties in the state thousands of taxpayer dollars. In Shelby County, the election administrator estimated the cost to be more than $200,000. In Davidson County, the administrator said it cost $35,000 to process and correct forms with insufficient information. Hargett also cited a last-minute surge in voter registration applications as reason for requiring forms to be submitted within 10 days of collection. Activist calls the bill a direct attack Tequila Johnson, co-founder of The Equity Alliance and a manager in last year's elections for the Tennessee Black Voter Project, talks to reporters in Nashville on April 2. (AP Photo/Jonathan Mattise) Tequila Johnson says the bill is a direct attack on the work done by the Tennessee Black Voter Project, for which she served as a statewide manager in the last election. The project was a coordinated effort across several organizations and turned in about 90,000 voter registration applications last year. It also focused on educating voters and building coalitions. ""This project highlighted some really, really big topics here in the state and brought a lot of people together across party lines, across race lines,"" she said. ""And I personally think that that is a threat for what our state stands for right now."" Even though the bill could subject her to potential fines and other consequences if passed, Johnson said it wouldn't discourage her from working on voter registration. ""It would be cowardly of me to give up now because Tre Hargett wants to figure out how to continuously oppress young people, people of color, women and elderly people's right to vote."" Hargett's office has not yet returned a phone call for comment."

"Controversial Colorado gun bill becomes law, 11 sheriffs willing to choose jail over enforcement",www.cnn.com,"Scott McLean and Sara Weisfeldt, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/colorado-red-flag-gun-laws/index.html,"Controversial Colorado gun bill becomes law, 11 sheriffs willing to choose jail over enforcement CNN 9 hrs ago By Scott McLean and Sara Weisfeldt, CNN © Tom Pennington/Getty/FILE A detail view of pistols that were turned in during a gun buy back program at the First Presbyterian Church of Dallas on January 19, 2013 in Dallas, Texas. Colorado's controversial ""red flag"" bill was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis on Friday, with more than half of the state's counties declaring opposition to it and many sheriffs promising not to enforce it at all.
""This is a moment of progress,"" said Colorado House Majority Leader Alec Garnett, one of the legislation's four sponsors. ""Today, we did something that was difficult and that is going to save lives.""
Known as the ""Extreme Risk Protection Order,"" the law will allow a family member, a roommate or law enforcement to petition a judge to temporarily seize a person's firearms if they are deemed a risk to themselves or others. Fourteen other states have passed similar legislation.
Still, the law now faces major hurdles, with a pro-gun lobby group promising to challenge it in court. Additionally, a growing number of sheriffs in the state have vowed to ignore the law when it takes effect next year, calling it unconstitutional.
Weld County Sheriff Steve Reams told CNN last month that he would rather be found in contempt of court and locked up in his own county jail than carry out a court order to seize a person's weapon.
At least 10 other sheriffs contacted by CNN are lining up behind Reams, saying they are prepared to go to jail rather than enforce a law they believe would violate a person's constitutional rights.
""How many judges are going to send all the sheriffs in Colorado who are standing up to this to jail?"" wondered Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell, who is among the sheriffs willing to choose jail over enforcement.
Garnett said he wasn't concerned about sheriffs being locked up.
""What I'm going to lose sleep over is, if that's the choice that they make, and someone loses their life, someone in crisis goes on a shooting spree, (or) someone commits suicide"" because a gun wasn't taken away, he said.
Already, 38 of Colorado's 64 counties have officially declared their opposition to the bill, and 35 of them have passed formal resolutions against the law. Many of the resolutions declare the jurisdictions to be Second Amendment ""sanctuary"" or ""preservation"" counties, and pledge not to allocate resources to enforcement of the law.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser he is ""confident that when and if the time comes, all law enforcement officials will follow the rule of law.""
Reams insists he's not bluffing. So does Prowers County Sheriff Sam Zordel.
""I've already asked the coroner if he wanted to come over (to the jail) and get some training,"" he said, explaining that if he becomes an inmate, the coroner would be tasked with running the county jail.
Others took a more measured approach.
""I'm willing to go to my jail for it, the only exception would be a totally extreme case and most sheriffs would agree with that,"" said Park County Sheriff Tom McGraw.
The law is meant to be used only in the most extreme cases, but critics believe it will allow for guns to be taken based on a false accusation. A non-partisan analysis of the bill by Colorado's Legislative Council Staff predicted that the number of false red flag petitions would be minimal, and that the law would only be used 170 times per year.
California and Washington use similar red flag laws even less than that, though a similar law in Maryland is enforced six times more often than the Colorado estimate.
""Rocky Mountain Gun Owners is going to file a lawsuit against the red flag legislation before the end of the session,"" the lobby group's executive director, Dudley Brown, said. The legislative session ends May 3. Brown also said there could be a second lawsuit filed after the bill becomes law, but declined to provide more details.
Brown is also planning recall efforts of ""at least 10"" state lawmakers who supported the legislation. Two Colorado lawmakers were successfully recalled in 2013 after supporting controversial background check legislation and a restriction on magazine size.
The El Paso County Sheriff's office initially said the county would file a lawsuit when the legislation became law. The county now says it is still ""in the brainstorming phase"" of a potential lawsuit, according to county spokesman Matt Steiner.
According to the Giffords Law Center, which lobbies for tougher gun laws, there have not been any successful legal challenges of any similar state laws. There is, however, an ongoing complaint in an Illinois district court asking for an injunction, arguing that the law violates the Second and 14th amendments.
Assuming Colorado's law withstands a court challenge, defiant local sheriffs are on a legal collision course with the state. State law enforcement agencies like the Colorado State Patrol do ""not have the authority to supersede local control,"" and seize the guns instead, according to Shelby Wieman, a spokeswoman for Gov. Polis.
Polis is confident that law enforcement will not ignore court orders to seize weapons, but if they do, it would be for the district courts or the state attorney general to resolve.
The declaration of a ""sanctuary county"" borrows the phrasing used by immigration advocates to describe jurisdictions where local law enforcement does not cooperate with federal immigration authorities, even when undocumented immigrants charged with crimes enter local jails.
If it's OK to ignore immigration laws, why can't Colorado counties ignore gun laws?
University of Denver law professor John Campbell said local law enforcement ""can't choose not to enforce their state's law."" But the enforcement of federal laws, such as immigration legislation, are voluntary for local authorities.
If a sheriff were to ignore a court order to seize a person's guns and they use them to hurt someone, Campbell believes the sheriff could be held liable. Law enforcement has immunity for genuine mistakes, but not for recklessness or blatantly ignoring their legal duty.
""Those are classic conditions to create liability even when people typically would enjoy immunity,"" he said.
© Facebook/Liz Sullivan Kate Steinle While the legal obligation to enforce court-ordered gun seizures is different than enforcing immigration laws, Campbell said the outcomes can be the same -- someone getting hurt or killed.
In 2015, 31-year-old Kate Steinle was killed by an undocumented immigrant who was released from jail despite a request from federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to turn him over. A federal appeals court ruled last month that Steinle's parents cannot sue over San Francisco's ""sanctuary"" policy that allowed her killer to avoid deportation and walk free.
Garnett said sheriffs should enforce the new gun law, but wouldn't make a statement on enforcing immigration law.
""Immigration laws are primarily federal issues and I'm not going to get into that,"" he said.
Sheriff Reams acknowledged his risk of liability for ignoring a court-ordered gun seizure, but he's not worried.
""The person who commits a crime against another is truly the person responsible,"" he said, adding that if a person is mentally ill, he would use existing laws to detain them for treatment. ""We still intend to deal with the person.""

Jet Airways cancels all long-haul international flights,rss.cnn.com,"Bard Wilkinson, CNN",04-12-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/NNbuwiNRBlU/index.html,"(CNN) Struggling Indian airline Jet Airways has canceled all its international flights, raising fears that it may be close to collapse.
The airline said in a statement on Friday that it ""has canceled its international operations from 12th to 15th April."" All of Jet's long-haul services — including to London, Paris and Amsterdam — were suspended from Thursday night, but a spokesperson initially said earlier Friday that all long-haul flights had resumed. However, the airline later announced the cancellation of all international flights until Monday, adding that it was ""working to minimize guest inconvenience."" Thursday's cancellation of flights prompted India's Aviation Minister, Suresh Prabhu, to tweet on Friday that his ministry would ""review issues related to Jet Airways"" and ""take necessary steps to minimize passenger inconvenience and ensure their safety.""

— Chowkidar Suresh Prabhu (@sureshpprabhu) April 12, 2019 A collapse of the airline would tarnish Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pro-business credentials as Indians vote in elections that started on Thursday. The failure of a major airline would put thousands of jobs at risk. Jet Airways has already canceled thousands of domestic and international flights as planes were grounded over the non-payment of fees to aircraft leasing companies. It told the Bombay Stock Exchange Thursday that it had grounded 10 more planes due to unpaid dues. Last month the company's founder was forced to quit as part of a government-backed bailout. Naresh Goyal stepped down as chairman and resigned from the board, allowing banks to take control and overhaul the company. India's largest public bank, the State Bank of India (SBI), has been leading the consortium of creditors, which started the stake sale process on Monday. Several airlines, including Etihad, are interested in bidding, according to reports. Etihad already owns a 24% stake in Jet Airways. A spokesperson for the UAE-based airline declined to comment on the bidding process. India is the fastest-growing aviation market in the world but competition is fierce. Airlines struggle to make money given the intense pressure on fares. Rising oil prices and a volatile Indian currency have made life even harder. Jet Airways has racked up huge losses and exhausted the patience of its creditors. Profits at market leader IndiGo have also suffered and the government was forced to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the national carrier, Air India, after a failed privatization attempt early last year."
Indian elections: Kashmiri voters speak out as violence continues,rss.cnn.com,Sugam Pokharel and Nikhil Kumar,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/bVSdDDBhbJk/index.html,"Uri, Indian-controlled Kashmir (CNN) Kashmir resident Gulam Rasul has seen it all: Two wars between India and Pakistan which were sparked by the disputed region as well as dozens of other armed conflicts.
Over the years, he's given up dreaming for peace. ""If you can't give us peace, give us the bunkers at least,"" says the 76-year-old, who lives in the town of Uri in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Uri sits perilously close to the Line of Control, the de facto border that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan. As a result, locals say, the town and surrounding villages are frequently caught in the crossfire when the two sides fire shells at each other -- a common problem that's worsened in the aftermath of an aerial dogfight in late February. Kashmir resident Gulam Rasul has given up dreaming of peace. ""We want the bunkers so that we have a place to hide during intense shelling. We don't have anywhere to go and no means to protect ourselves. This is injustice,"" Rasul says. India's main political parties, according to Rasul, are ignoring the area's real problem -- unemployment -- and instead are just using the Kashmir issue for political gain, especially in the run-up to a nationwide election which got underway earlier this week. An Indian soldier guards as Kashmiri voters queue up to cast their votes outside a polling station at Shadipora, outskirts of Srinagar, in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Read More Apart from the regular cross-border shelling, there are constant clashes between local militant groups and Indian troops and police. The relentless cycle of violence has a severe impact on daily lives, with the cost of essential supplies rocketing during flare-ups. ""Living here is expensive. Dying here is extremely cheap,"" Rasul says. Local political activist Nadim Abbasi organizes protests aimed at bringing these issues to light. On his mobile, he shows photos of Reyaz Ahmad, who was critically injured when a shell hit his house in a border village near Uri in early March. The 32-year-old had to have his legs amputated and died in hospital two weeks later. The town of Uri in Indian controlled Kashmir, close to the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that divides this disputed region between India and Pakistan. ""A bunker could have saved his life,"" Abbasi says. For vegetable seller Nadim Khan, 75, the cross-border shelling is nothing out of the ordinary. ""Coming here must be exotic for foreign journalists like you, right?"" Khan says mockingly. ""This is an everyday reality for us. I grew up seeing this, and I'll die seeing this. The situation will be the same for generations to come. Nothing will change. I don't worry about it anymore. I will die the day and the way Allah wishes,"" Khan adds. India and Pakistan each control part of mainly Muslim Kashmir but each claim the region in its entirety. A revolt since 1989 in the Indian section, by groups seeking independence or union with Pakistan, has claimed thousands of lives. The impact of the conflict isn't confined to the border area -- it reverberates across Kashmir including Srinagar, the main city in the Indian-controlled section. Protesters say violence in Kashmir has a severe impact on their daily lives. When CNN visited in March, the city center resembled a ghost town. Local separatist groups had called for a shutdown after a teacher arrested for alleged terror links died in police custody. Schools and businesses were closed, and streets were deserted except for police or troops on every corner -- not an unusual sight for Srinagar residents. For visitors, the city is one of juxtaposing realities: A mesmerizing landscape, with a backdrop of tall mountains, in what is one of the most heavily militarized places on Earth. Last year was the bloodiest in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir in a decade: 238 militants died while 86 police or troops and 37 civilians lost their lives. 2017 was hardly less deadly. Life goes on in Uri, despite the frequent shelling. The death in 2016 of Burhan Wani, an influential young militant leader, sparked a wave of unrest that has claimed scores of civilian lives and left thousands injured. Many were partially or fully blinded by the use of pellet guns, a controversial move by Indian security forces to quell protests. The separatist insurgency and the frequent quarrels between India and Pakistan have hit the local tourism industry hard. Some 12.5 million tourists visited Jammu and Kashmir in 2012, a figure which dropped to 7.3 million in 2017. Tourists used to start flocking to the region in early spring. Tourists used to start flocking to the region in early spring. Not anymore. The houseboats on the idyllic Dal Lake -- one of the most popular destinations in Srinagar -- sit empty and dozens of boatmen on the shores wait desperately for customers. Hotel taxi driver Mohammad Shafi complains that he didn't have a single customer for a couple of weeks in early March, when India and Pakistan were on the brink of war. ""The tulip gardens of Srinagar are expected to be in full bloom in a few weeks...Inshallah (God willing), the tourists will start coming again soon,"" he says hopefully."
Louisiana arson suspect expressed disgust with Baptist churches on Facebook - CNN,us.cnn.com,Paul P. Murphy,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/louisiana-church-fires-suspect/index.html,"(CNN) Four days before his arrest in connection with the three Louisiana Baptist church fires, Holden Matthews expressed disgust with Baptist beliefs on Facebook, CNN has learned.
Responding to a post about ""afrikan spirituality,"" Matthews, posting under the name Noctis Matthews, said he cannot ""stand all these baptists around here, bunch of brainwashed people trying to find happiness in a religion that was forced on their ancestors just as it was on mine."" A charred gas can and a debit card led to a suspect in the Louisiana black church fires In the posting, Matthews said he wished that, ""more blacks [sic] people would look into ancient beliefs of pre Christian Africa."" An acquaintance, Nygyl Bryyn, confirmed to CNN the profile and alias is that of Holden Matthews. He says his friend is not racist and believes the churches were, ""victims of circumstances."" All three churches authorities say Matthews burned down were black Baptist churches in the heart of south central Louisiana's Cajun and Creole country. Read More The suspect is the 21-year-old son of a St. Landry Parish sheriff's deputy and may have been influenced by ""black metal"" music and its ""associated history with church burnings,"" the state fire marshal's office said. Authorities say black metal may have influenced the Louisiana church fires suspect. Here's what to know. CNN reached out to Matthews' lawyer and the prosecutor's office but have not yet received a response. When CNN asked authorities if they were aware of the posting, they said because the investigation was ongoing they would not detail any particular leads they are following. While the motive is still under investigation, authorities said that Matthews' interest in black metal music may have influenced his behavior. Black metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music that typically takes on anti-Christian, satanic and pagan themes. The black metal songs typically have a fast tempo and feature shrieking vocals, heavily distorted guitars and unconventional song structures. A song from the suspect's band, Pagan Carnage, referenced church burnings. Their church was burning. They linked arms and prayed The day after police say Matthews burned down St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, a video was posted on his band's YouTube page of his song, ""Diabolical Soul Feast."" ""The holy church is now destroyed,"" Matthews screams in the final lyrics of the song. ""Burning down in Odin's name."" Bryyn says that Matthews writes and performs the song. The motive for the fires is still under investigation, and federal officials are looking into whether a hate crime was committed. Matthews is charged with three counts of simple arson on a religious building. Greater Union was among three historically black churches in rural St. Landry Parish, west of Baton Rouge, that police said were intentionally torched over a 10-day span. St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, located about six miles southeast of Greater Union, burned first on March 26. Greater Union Baptist was set ablaze on April 2. Mount Pleasant Baptist Church burned on April 4."

Tennessee wants to make it harder to hold voter registration drives - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Harmeet Kaur,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/tennessee-voter-registration-drive-bill-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Tennessee has one of the lowest voter registration rates in the country, according to Pew's Election Performance Index. Soon, it could get a lot harder to help people there register to vote.
Tennessee has a registration rate of 78.52%. While that would be a passing grade at school, it puts Tennessee at 45th among the 50 states for its voter registration rate. A bill currently making its way through the Tennessee legislature would impose new restrictions on groups that hold voter registration drives and subject them to potential jail time and massive fines. Under one of the provisions, individuals or organizations that submit 100 to 500 ""deficient"" voter registration applications, meaning forms that are incomplete or contain incorrect information, could be hit with a $150 to $2,000 fine. Submitting more than 500 ""deficient"" forms could result in a fine of up to $10,000. Forms would have to be delivered or mailed within 10 days of being collected, or by the state's voter registration deadline. Tennessee cuts off voter registration at 30 days before election day. Read More The bill would also make it more difficult to hold a voter registration drive in the first place. Voters cast their ballots at Franklin Community of Faith Church of the Nazarene on November 6, 2018. (Brandon Dill for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Before holding a drive, an organization registering 100 or more people would have to: provide the county elections coordinator with contact information for the people conducting the drive, notify the coordinator about where the drive is being held, complete voter registration training through the elections coordinator and file a sworn statement stating it'll abide by all voter registration laws and procedures. Violating any of those rules ""intentionally and knowingly"" would constitute a Class A misdemeanor -- the most serious misdemeanor, punishable by up to 11 months and 29 days in jail and/or a fine of up to $2,500. The rules wouldn't apply to volunteers who sign up voters or to organizations that rely solely on volunteers to register voters. But the law is vague about what organizations count as having paid staff. In the Tennessee state Senate, the bill has made its way through local and state committee and has been referred to the calendar committee for scheduling. In the state House, it has advanced through committees and is on the calendar for April 15. Scholars and civil rights groups raise alarm Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett, whose office is behind the legislation, wrote in an op-ed for the Tennessean that the law is intended to preserve the integrity of the election process. ""While we strive to register Tennesseans to vote, it must be done responsibly and in a manner that does not compromise the security of elections,"" Hargett wrote. ""Groups that seek to register large numbers of voters, while typically doing so with good intentions, potentially put legitimate voter registrations at risk."" But scholars and civil rights groups argue that the law targets disenfranchised communities and say it would have a chilling effect on those trying to help others vote. ""Voter registration drives have long been used to empower communities that are historically disenfranchised, including students, immigrants, people of color and seniors,"" Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee told CNN. ""This legislation would inhibit access to the ballot and undermine civic engagement."" Discriminatory voter laws have surged in last 5 years, federal commission finds Sekou Franklin, a professor of political science at Middle Tennessee State University, called the proposed law ""draconian"" and said it was a response to heightened mobilization among African-American voters in the last election. ""You don't jail people for trying to politically participate in a democratic way unless you have other motives,"" Franklin said. Franklin said he was troubled that individuals and organizations could potentially incur fines for inconsistencies or errors in voter registration forms. ""There's always deficient applications,"" Franklin said. ""If you're an organization and you register three or four thousand voters, and you have 100 deficient applications, that could be a $10,000 hit. That's a one percent rate."" In his op-ed, Hargett wrote that deficient applications cost the two largest counties in the state thousands of taxpayer dollars. In Shelby County, the election administrator estimated the cost to be more than $200,000. In Davidson County, the administrator said it cost $35,000 to process and correct forms with insufficient information. Hargett also cited a last-minute surge in voter registration applications as reason for requiring forms to be submitted within 10 days of collection. Activist calls the bill a direct attack Tequila Johnson, co-founder of The Equity Alliance and a manager in last year's elections for the Tennessee Black Voter Project, talks to reporters in Nashville on April 2. (AP Photo/Jonathan Mattise) Tequila Johnson says the bill is a direct attack on the work done by the Tennessee Black Voter Project, for which she served as a statewide manager in the last election. The project was a coordinated effort across several organizations and turned in about 90,000 voter registration applications last year. It also focused on educating voters and building coalitions. ""This project highlighted some really, really big topics here in the state and brought a lot of people together across party lines, across race lines,"" she said. ""And I personally think that that is a threat for what our state stands for right now."" Even though the bill could subject her to potential fines and other consequences if passed, Johnson said it wouldn't discourage her from working on voter registration. ""It would be cowardly of me to give up now because Tre Hargett wants to figure out how to continuously oppress young people, people of color, women and elderly people's right to vote."" Hargett's office has not yet returned a phone call for comment."

RELATED: 'Zero tolerance' a year later: How the US family separations crisis erupted The filing, a regular status update submitted as part of the American Civil Liberties Union's lawsuit over separations of undocumented immigrant families, indicates that officials have made major headway in the court-ordered reunification process after months of efforts to track down hundreds of parents who were deported without their children. But officials are gearing up for a new push to identify potentially thousands more separated families, and they've said it could take them two years to do that. The latest on reunification efforts Read More The reunification process for the child who remains in custody could still take time, officials said Friday, as they're awaiting word on whether the parent wants to be reunified. ""Currently, there is one child in (Office of Refugee Resettlement) care proceeding toward reunification or other appropriate discharge,"" the filing said. ""This child has a parent who departed from the United States, but the Steering Committee has advised that resolution of parental preference will be delayed."" More than 40 other children from separated families remain in government custody, but officials say those children won't be reunited with their parents, either because the parents waived reunification or because the parents were deemed unfit or a danger. A total of 2,162 children from separated families have been reunified with their parents, the court filing said. The next phase An explosive government watchdog report in January revealed there could be thousands more families who were separated at the border but weren't previously acknowledged by the government. And last month US District Judge Dana Sabraw ruled that those families should be included in the class action lawsuit over family separations. The government first detailed its proposed plan for identifying these previously unacknowledged families a week ago, outlining a strategy for piecing together exactly who might have been separated by combing through thousands of records using a mix of data analysis and manual review. In this Friday's court filing, the government said it had begun an ""expedited procurement process"" to hire contractors to help with that effort ""if necessary,"" including three data scientists and at least 10 contractors to work full time manually reviewing case files. The proposed plan for identifying additional separated families has drawn sharp criticism from the ACLU, which has accused officials of dragging their feet. Before a hearing scheduled for next week, the ACLU says, it plans to submit to the court ""specific reasons why the government does not need two years and how the identification process can be completed in far less time."""

The warrants ""concern investigations that remain ongoing,"" the filing says. There's so much sensitive information still in the search warrants that they should not even be released with redactions, the Justice Department argues.

""Although the Special Counsel has concluded his investigation, the requested materials concern investigations that remain ongoing, a trial in (Stone's case) that is scheduled for later this year, and the privacy interests of uncharged third parties. No right of public access applies to such materials,"" the prosecutors said. A media coalition, including CNN, had asked to unseal the Stone warrants. Prosecutors even gave a hypothetical about ongoing investigations, saying it's possible a defendant gets charged with a crime but still has other conduct and communication with others under investigation. Read More ""The Special Counsel's investigation has involved multiple lines of inquiry. Many have been handled in the Special Counsel's Office.

The agency is tracing the phone to figure out if it belongs to Moore or Ravenelle. The National Police believe the car with Ravenelle, 52, and Moore, 40, plunged not long after the pair left for the airport to catch a flight home to New York. Detectives spoke to fishermen who said they heard a loud noise coming from 19 kilometers (about 11.8 miles) away from the freeway of Las Americas, Santo Domingo Este early that morning, the National Police said. The fishermen said they found a woman who was seriously injured and not carrying any identification, police said. If she had known her friend was in a Dominican Republic ICU, she could have held her hand before she died She was taken by ambulance to the hospital with severe trauma and contusions to the head, hospital spokesman Dario Mañon said. Ravenelle died April 4, before she was in a condition in which hospital officials could take her photo and share it with the media, he said. Mañon told CNN that no family or friends had called the hospital looking for Ravenelle. The fishermen also reported seeing a vehicle at the bottom of the sea, but because of rough conditions, divers had not been able to identify the vehicle, Durán Mejia said. Crews waited days for the seas to calm to begin their search. On March 31, the body of a man fitting the description of Moore was found at sea near Sans Souci, Durán Mejia said. Police are still working to identify the body they believe is Moore's, but they say they are sure both bodies of the missing pair have been found. Authorities are hoping Moore's brother can identify him by photographs of his tattoos. One of his tattoos, on the right arm, reads ""Milan."" Moore's friend, Francesca Figueroa, told CNN she confirmed to the police that Moore has a tattoo with his daughter's name, ""Milan,"" on his arm. People gathered at the extraction site. Moore and Ravenelle were friends who worked together and decided to take a trip to the Dominican Republic, Figueroa said. They arrived in the country March 24. Cheryl Freeman said she and her boyfriend spent time with Moore and Ravenelle while on vacation in the resort town of Samana. Freeman said Moore and Ravenelle had a 2 a.m. flight and were driving a rental car to the airport. Ravenelle repeatedly asked Moore if he was sure they had enough gas to make it to the airport, Freeman said. She kept checking to make sure their phones were charged enough to use the GPS, Freeman said. The two were due back in New York on March 27, but airport surveillance shows they never made it into the airport building. Police now believe an accident caused them to drive off the freeway and into the sea. Authorities said there was no evidence of foul play. The case has not been closed, and Durán Mejia said there are still many unanswered questions around the circumstances of the accident."
Indian elections: Kashmiri voters speak out as violence continues,us.cnn.com,Sugam Pokharel and Nikhil Kumar,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/india/uri-kashmir-goes-to-the-polls-intl/index.html,"Uri, Indian-controlled Kashmir (CNN) Kashmir resident Gulam Rasul has seen it all: Two wars between India and Pakistan which were sparked by the disputed region as well as dozens of other armed conflicts.
Over the years, he's given up dreaming for peace. ""If you can't give us peace, give us the bunkers at least,"" says the 76-year-old, who lives in the town of Uri in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Uri sits perilously close to the Line of Control, the de facto border that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan. As a result, locals say, the town and surrounding villages are frequently caught in the crossfire when the two sides fire shells at each other -- a common problem that's worsened in the aftermath of an aerial dogfight in late February. Kashmir resident Gulam Rasul has given up dreaming of peace. ""We want the bunkers so that we have a place to hide during intense shelling. We don't have anywhere to go and no means to protect ourselves. This is injustice,"" Rasul says. India's main political parties, according to Rasul, are ignoring the area's real problem -- unemployment -- and instead are just using the Kashmir issue for political gain, especially in the run-up to a nationwide election which got underway earlier this week. An Indian soldier guards as Kashmiri voters queue up to cast their votes outside a polling station at Shadipora, outskirts of Srinagar, in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Read More Apart from the regular cross-border shelling, there are constant clashes between local militant groups and Indian troops and police. The relentless cycle of violence has a severe impact on daily lives, with the cost of essential supplies rocketing during flare-ups. ""Living here is expensive. Dying here is extremely cheap,"" Rasul says. Local political activist Nadim Abbasi organizes protests aimed at bringing these issues to light. On his mobile, he shows photos of Reyaz Ahmad, who was critically injured when a shell hit his house in a border village near Uri in early March. The 32-year-old had to have his legs amputated and died in hospital two weeks later. The town of Uri in Indian controlled Kashmir, close to the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that divides this disputed region between India and Pakistan. ""A bunker could have saved his life,"" Abbasi says. For vegetable seller Nadim Khan, 75, the cross-border shelling is nothing out of the ordinary. ""Coming here must be exotic for foreign journalists like you, right?"" Khan says mockingly. ""This is an everyday reality for us. I grew up seeing this, and I'll die seeing this. The situation will be the same for generations to come. Nothing will change. I don't worry about it anymore. I will die the day and the way Allah wishes,"" Khan adds. India and Pakistan each control part of mainly Muslim Kashmir but each claim the region in its entirety. A revolt since 1989 in the Indian section, by groups seeking independence or union with Pakistan, has claimed thousands of lives. The impact of the conflict isn't confined to the border area -- it reverberates across Kashmir including Srinagar, the main city in the Indian-controlled section. Protesters say violence in Kashmir has a severe impact on their daily lives. When CNN visited in March, the city center resembled a ghost town. Local separatist groups had called for a shutdown after a teacher arrested for alleged terror links died in police custody. Schools and businesses were closed, and streets were deserted except for police or troops on every corner -- not an unusual sight for Srinagar residents. For visitors, the city is one of juxtaposing realities: A mesmerizing landscape, with a backdrop of tall mountains, in what is one of the most heavily militarized places on Earth. Last year was the bloodiest in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir in a decade: 238 militants died while 86 police or troops and 37 civilians lost their lives. 2017 was hardly less deadly. Life goes on in Uri, despite the frequent shelling. The death in 2016 of Burhan Wani, an influential young militant leader, sparked a wave of unrest that has claimed scores of civilian lives and left thousands injured. Many were partially or fully blinded by the use of pellet guns, a controversial move by Indian security forces to quell protests. The separatist insurgency and the frequent quarrels between India and Pakistan have hit the local tourism industry hard. Some 12.5 million tourists visited Jammu and Kashmir in 2012, a figure which dropped to 7.3 million in 2017. Tourists used to start flocking to the region in early spring. Tourists used to start flocking to the region in early spring. Not anymore. The houseboats on the idyllic Dal Lake -- one of the most popular destinations in Srinagar -- sit empty and dozens of boatmen on the shores wait desperately for customers. Hotel taxi driver Mohammad Shafi complains that he didn't have a single customer for a couple of weeks in early March, when India and Pakistan were on the brink of war. ""The tulip gardens of Srinagar are expected to be in full bloom in a few weeks...Inshallah (God willing), the tourists will start coming again soon,"" he says hopefully."
These issues could doom US-EU trade talks before they start,edition.cnn.com,Ivana Kottasová,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/business/eu-us-trade-talks/index.html,"London (CNNBusiness) Europe is ready to resume talks with the United States about a transatlantic trade deal. But they may already be doomed.
EU member states voted Monday to open trade talks with the United States despite opposition from France, which objects to the US position on climate change and could scupper a final deal. Cecilia Malmström, Europe's top trade official, said she would reach out to the Trump administration ""as soon as they wake up"" to inform them of the outcome. ""We are ready [to start the talks] whenever they are,"" she added. However, a disagreement over agriculture could derail talks before they even start. The European Union says agriculture won't be up for discussion, while the United States insists it must be part of negotiations . Read More The divisions underscore the difficulty of the task facing negotiators, and the complicated history of trade talks between the United States and Europe. The last push for a major trade deal — known as TTIP — ended in a stalemate in 2016.

But French President Emmanuel Macron has already staked out his position on talks: Europe should not negotiate a trade deal with a country that is not part of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate. ""It is a question of values: Europe must be exemplary and firm in its protection of climate,"" a spokesperson for Macron said in a statement. It is a question of values: Europe must be exemplary and firm in its protection of climate.""
Spokesperson for Emmanuel Macron
President Donald Trump announced in 2017 that the United States would withdraw from the accord. Macron argues that it wouldn't be fair for only one party of a trade deal to follow the strict environmental standards agreed in Paris. France voted against opening trade talks on Monday, but was overruled by a majority of EU member states. While France couldn't prevent the start of trade discussions with the United States, it can block any deal that results. All EU member states must sign off on trade deals negotiated by the bloc. ""This fight will have to continue, particularly in the European Parliament, without which no trade agreement can be approved after the negotiations,"" said the spokesperson for Macron. US threatens tariffs on $11 billion of European goods over Airbus subsidies The farming problem The United States and the European Union are already at loggerheads over whether agriculture should be included in trade discussions. The European Union is very protective of its heavily-subsidized agricultural sector. The United States, meanwhile, wants to break down tariffs and sell farm products in Europe. It's a highly emotional issue in many parts of the Europe, where voters fear that a trade deal with the United States would open their doors to genetically modified crops or chicken washed with chlorine. The United States insists that if Europe wants a deal, it has to include agriculture. ""We're working on other areas with the realization that there's not going to be any [free trade agreement] without agriculture,"" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last month. Meanwhile, EU officials argue that agriculture has never been on the table. When European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker visited the White House last year, they point out, he and Trump only agreed to work toward eliminating tariffs and barriers on ""non-auto industrial goods."" The joint statement issued by the two leaders at the time made no mention of agriculture. On Monday, Malmström again cited the document in saying that agriculture would not be discussed. Trump says 'granddaddy' US-China trade pact could be done in 'weeks' Rising tensions The disagreements follow a series of confrontations between the Untied States and Europe over trade. Earlier this week, the Trump administration threatened to impose tariffs on European goods worth $11 billions over aircraft subsidies. The European Commission said it would seek to retaliate. Trump is also considering whether to impose tariffs of up to 25% on European vehicle imports , with a decision due by the middle May. He's already imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminum exports. Europe retaliated with tariffs on more than $3 billion worth of American products such as motorcycles, orange juice, bourbon, cigarettes and denim."

It told the Bombay Stock Exchange Thursday that it had grounded 10 more planes due to unpaid dues. Last month the company's founder was forced to quit as part of a government-backed bailout. Naresh Goyal stepped down as chairman and resigned from the board, allowing banks to take control and overhaul the company. India's largest public bank, the State Bank of India (SBI), has been leading the consortium of creditors, which started the stake sale process on Monday. Several airlines, including Etihad, are interested in bidding, according to reports. Etihad already owns a 24% stake in Jet Airways. A spokesperson for the UAE-based airline declined to comment on the bidding process. India is the fastest-growing aviation market in the world but competition is fierce. Airlines struggle to make money given the intense pressure on fares. Rising oil prices and a volatile Indian currency have made life even harder. Jet Airways has racked up huge losses and exhausted the patience of its creditors. Profits at market leader IndiGo have also suffered and the government was forced to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the national carrier, Air India, after a failed privatization attempt early last year."
Upskirting is now a crime in England and Wales,us.cnn.com,"Matthew Robinson, CNN",04-12-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/uk/upskirting-uk-criminal-offense-intl-scli-gbr/index.html,"London (CNN) Upskirting is now a criminal offense in England and Wales, after a campaign by a woman who was targeted by an offender at a music festival.
The offense -- which involves taking a photo under an individual's clothing with the intention of viewing their underwear, genitals or buttocks without their knowledge -- will be punishable by up to two years' imprisonment, with the most serious offenders being placed on the sex offenders' registers, Britain's Ministry of Justice said Friday. ""We have always been clear -- there are no excuses for this behavior and offenders should feel the full force of the law. From today, they will,"" Justice Minister Lucy Frazer said in a statement. The legislation gained traction in Parliament after a campaign by Gina Martin, who became a victim of upskirting at the British Summer Time music festival in 2017. Martin, now 27, reported the incident to the police but was shocked when they declined to prosecute. She subsequently discovered that upskirting was not a specific offense under English law. Read More She expressed her anger at how the incident was handled on Facebook, and her post quickly went viral, with many posters sharing their own experiences. Martin launched an online petition calling for her case to be reopened by the police, and it soon gained 50,000 signatures and was picked up by Wera Hobhouse, a member of Parliament for the Liberal Democrats. Hobhouse subsequently brought a bill to Parliament calling for the creation of a specific upskirting offense. Lawmaker blocks bid to criminalize upskirting in the UK Her bill was expected to pass easily through the House of Commons, but it was blocked by one MP from the governing Conservative Party during its second reading. Nonetheless, the government gave its support to a new law, and the Voyeurism Act was brought before Parliament last summer, successfully passing both houses. ""Finally we have a fit-for-purpose law that protects against every instance of upskirting -- as we should have always had,"" Martin said in a statement on Friday. ""But this is just the beginning,"" she added. ""Please raise your voice and report if you are a victim or if you see someone become one -- every report builds a picture so we can stop upskirting."" Frazer added: ""By taking decisive action and working closely with Gina Martin and other campaigners, we have ensured more people are protected from this degrading and humiliating practice."" #Upskirting is now a crime! It's been just over a year since I tabled my bill to bring about this change...one step towards enshrining women's autonomy over their own bodies in to law.

— Wera Hobhouse MP (@Wera_Hobhouse) April 12, 2019 Hobhouse, the MP who proposed the original legislation, wrote on Twitter that the implementation of this law represents ""one step towards enshrining women's autonomy over their own bodies in to law. Positive change in politics."" Even before the creation of the new law, upskirting didn't always go unpunished, with some successful prosecutions under the Outraging Public Decency law. However, that law did not cover every instance of upskirting. The new legislation strengthens the existing 2003 Sexual Offences Act, designating upskirting a sexual offense when its purpose is to ""obtain sexual gratification or cause humiliation, distress or alarm,"" according to the Ministry of Justice. Upskirting has been illegal in Scotland since 2010, but it is not yet a specific offense in Northern Ireland."

However, Zuckerberg's total compensation jumped from $9.1 million in 2017 to $22.6 million in 2018 in order to cover the increase in security costs for the high-profile CEO.

Wealthy and urbane, he traveled the world, moving between properties in France and Saudi Arabia. He attended the elite Sorbonne University in Paris -- and is fluent in Arabic, English and French.
But on the night of January 4, 2018, Prince Salman's world came crashing down. Not all the facts are clear, but friends say the prince was at his home near Riyadh when he received a summons to the Qasr al Hukm palace. When he arrived at the palace, an argument quickly became a fracas. Friends of Prince Salman say Saud al Qahtani, who was then a close adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was present.

Read More Friends of Prince Salman say he was detained and taken to the maximum security Ha'ir prison outside Riyadh. The only official comment at the time came from prosecutors who said 11 princes had been detained after they had gathered at a royal palace in Riyadh in a protest against the government suspending payment of their utility bills. ""Despite being informed that their demands were not lawful, the 11 princes refused to leave the area, disrupting public peace and order. Members of a security services stepped in to restore order and the princes were arrested,"" the prosecutors statement said. Whatever caused the dispute, human rights groups say Prince Salman's imprisonment illustrates a pattern that's emerged in Saudi Arabia over the last two years: one of arbitrary detention where charges are rarely brought and where individuals are detained if they seek redress for a friend or family member who is under arrest. Two days after Prince Salman was detained, his father, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Mohammad Al Saud, was also arrested -- after involving international lawyers in his son's case. Saudi authorities have not responded to repeated requests from CNN for information about the two men. Neither has been charged, according to associates. Prince Salman is not a senior royal, but he is married to a daughter of the late King Abdullah. For the first four months of his detention, Prince Salman was allowed no communication with friends or family. Friends say he was then allowed two telephone calls a week. After more than a year in detention, he and his father were moved to a different, guarded compound where conditions were less sparse. They were recently permitted visits from family members. The reasons for Prince Salman's arrest 15 months ago are still unclear.

Prince Turki was an adviser to the King who had worked at the Foreign Ministry for more than 30 years. Sources say Prince Turki had been privately critical of the Crown Prince. He was eventually released three months after being detained. Some friends of Prince Salman believe he may also have angered the Royal Court by meeting a prominent US Democratic congressman, Adam Schiff, along with a major donor to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, Andy Khawaja, weeks before the 2016 US election. The meeting was in Beverly Hills on October 16, 2016. They say the meeting had no political agenda but may have been perceived in Riyadh as counter to Saudi Arabia's unspoken preference for Donald Trump over Clinton. Schiff's office told CNN that the congressman doesn't recall any specifics from the discussion but assumes they would have talked about Middle East policy and Saudi Arabia generally. At the beginning of this month, CNN asked Saudi authorities why the prince and his father were detained, whether they have been charged and whether they have been allowed access to family and lawyers. Despite several requests for information, CNN received no response. The European Parliament has also asked for information about the case.

Aranda, whom police said took off running after the incident, was found inside the mall's transit station and arrested. Authorities described the boy's injuries as life-threatening and said witnesses gave him first aid. Police Chief Jeff Potts said he couldn't reveal details about the child's condition Saturday afternoon.

He had been banned from Mall of America in the past and was convicted of misdemeanors in two incidents there in 2015, court records show. Aranda was charged in July 2015 with causing damage inside stores after he threw items off the upper level of the mall to the lower level, court records obtained by CNN affiliate WCCO show. Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda, 24, was charged with attempted homicide. He was accused three months later of throwing glasses of ice water and tea at a woman in a restaurant at the mall after she refused to buy him food, the records show. In that incident, he got into a physical scuffle with the manager of the restaurant, sending panicked diners fleeing, according to court records that also note Aranda at that point had been banned from Mall of America property through early July 2016. In August 2015, witnesses saw Aranda smashing computers on the floor of a Minneapolis library, causing about $5,000 in damage, according to a 2015 complaint. Police were called and arrested him without incident after finding him at a bus stop across the street. Aranda in that case told authorities he got ""angry after he read something on the Facebook"" and so smashed five computers, screens and keyboards, court records show, citing a recorded statement. ""He said he has some anger issues and told the officer that it does not happen all the time,"" the complaint states.

Brexit battles are about to get bloodier - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Luke McGee,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/uk/brexit-luke-mcgee-analysis-intl-gbr/index.html,"London (CNN) On Friday, the United Kingdom missed its second Brexit deadline. By accepting the European Union's offer to remain until October 31, Theresa May all but guaranteed that the UK, which voted to leave the EU nearly three years ago, will participate in the European parliamentary elections next month .
The UK's inability to leave the EU on time is already impacting British and European politics. On the same day that Brexit didn't happen (for the second time), Nigel Farage, the former leader of the anti-EU UKIP, launched his new political movement, the Brexit Party. Theresa May defends Brexit delay amid calls to resign Farage, a Member of the European Parliament since 1999, says his party would target voters across the political spectrum who have been ""betrayed"" by the political class. He is placing a £1,000 ($1,300) bet on the Brexit Party winning the European elections and says that there will be ""no more Mr. Nice Guy"" on the campaign battlefield. Farage knows a thing or two about European elections. In 2014, he led his former party to victory in the UK. European elections have notoriously low turnout, which can work in the favor of more radical politicians chasing the protest vote. In 2014, this meant UKIP, a party without a single seat in the UK Parliament, sent more MEPs to Brussels than any mainstream party. Read More This time, Farage will be able to use the single most divisive issue in the country to his advantage. Even if his party isn't as successful as he hopes, it's likely that a large chunk of the MEPs the UK sends will be euroskeptic. This should worry the EU. As a full member state, the UK will have voting rights and be able to frustrate the EU's plans as long as it remains inside the bloc. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative MP and leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, says this belligerent behavior is entirely justifiable and necessary. ""The EU has not been sincerely cooperative during the Brexit process, so I don't think we owe a duty of cooperation to the EU in return,"" Rees-Mogg said. The EU has not been sincerely cooperative during the Brexit process, so I don't think we owe a duty of cooperation to the EU in return.
Jacob Rees-Mogg
""If we do send euroskeptic MEPs to Brussels, I don't expect them to cooperate with federalist EU schemes and they should block any attempts to increase the EU's budget."" This uncomfortable reality is dawning on Europeans. Marietje Schaake, a liberal member of the European Parliament, says key decisions will be made before October, including the election of a new EU Commission President. ""MEPs from the UK would have a vote on those. Similarly, the Brexit party will undoubtedly use every opportunity it has to negatively impact the EU, thereby clearly proving that contrary to its slogans, a seat at the table gives more influence than stepping away from it,"" Schaake said. The Brexit failure is also affecting domestic politics in London. Having spent two years trying to get both hardline Brexiteer members of her own party and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party on board with her plans, May last week gave up and started negotiating with the opposition Labour Party. With both camps so divided on the Brexit question, any compromise would lead to chaos among both parties' MPs. Some Labour MPs want Corbyn to push for a second referendum, meaning that they will approve May's deal, but on the condition that a public vote is then held. Even on that question, there is division on whether that vote should include the option to scrap Brexit altogether. Labour's official Brexit position is that the UK remains in a permanent customs union with the EU. That wouldn't only infuriate Conservative backbenchers, but members of May's government. Liam Fox, the UK's trade secretary, wrote that a customs union would leave the UK ""stuck in the worst of both worlds, not only unable to set our international trade policy but subject, without representation, to the policy of an entity over which MPs would have no democratic control."" It would also be unpopular among leave-supporting Labour MPs. Kate Hoey, a Labour MP who campaigned for Brexit, says ""any Labour government that signs up to the customs union would not be able to deliver radical policies like using state aid or nationalization. I do not see any customs union compromise that doesn't break the promises in either parties' 2017 manifestos."" Few in London expect the talks between the two parties to go anywhere. May has already said that if her deal passes, she will resign, thus cementing her political legacy as the prime minister that managed to take the UK out of the EU. But eager as she might be to see Brexit off once and for all, doing so at the cost of leaving her party a divided mess would be rash. Add to this the fact that the Labour Party can smell blood and has been in campaign mode for months. Why would it suddenly risk its credibility by bailing out a weak, Conservative government in May's final days as leader? JUST WATCHED Here's what you need to know about Brexit Replay More Videos ...

Here's what you need to know about Brexit 03:19 While ex-UKIP leader Farage and others might still be hopeful of a pure, clean Brexit, the impasse has also lit a fire under Remain factions in the UK. ""It's April 29 and Britain hasn't left the European Union. Brexit is defeating itself,"" Wes Streeting, a pro-EU Labour MP told me earlier this week. He says the campaign for a second referendum is in a far stronger position than many believed it ever could be. ""The PM has tried stoically to deliver on the outcome of the referendum, but she's found it impossible to deliver on the promises that were made to people during the referendum."" In Brussels, European diplomats and EU officials have been discussing the growing sense that Brexit might be evaporating. It's a view shared by the group campaigning for a second referendum. Tom Brufatto, head of campaigns for the People's Vote, thinks that getting past March 29 was a ""sigh of relief for a majority of people in the UK. The risk of no deal on a fixed date was causing a lot of anxiety of stress."" It provided Remain supporters with solid proof that leaving the EU was not the inevitable conclusion of this process. I think there will be a mobilization of voters who want to take part in what will be the most important and high-profile election in the history of the European Union
Tom Brufatto
""The extension was seen as a beacon hope,"" he said. ""I think there will be a mobilization of voters who want to take part in what will be the most important and high-profile election in the history of the European Union."" The truth is that UK parliament's failure to agree on any Brexit outcome, combined with the EU's reluctance to kick the UK out, has left all options on the table. And the fact that there is no majority for anything in the House of Commons, while frustrating the Brexit process, means that whoever manages to break the deadlock first will likely win the day. Whether that's hardline Brexiteers forcing May out of office and replacing her with a firebreather, Remainers getting a second referendum or May pulling off the impossible and striking a deal with Labour is anyone's guess. The EU has given Britain breathing space to sort itself out. Its attempt to restore some semblance of calm to the Brexit process could lead to some of the bloodiest political battles yet."
'Arab Spring 2.0' is a reboot full of bugs - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Nick Paton Walsh,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/middleeast/npw-arab-spring-sudan-analysis-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The acts of hope and courage shown in Algeria and Sudan over the past weeks felt ever so fleetingly like a reprise of 2011's broad social awakening across the Arab world. But ""Arab Spring 2.0,"" as it has been called, is a reboot full of bugs that many users may seek to uninstall.
As in Zimbabwe in 2017, these movements of peaceful change have achieved what decades of opposition failed to do: unseat a superannuated and wildly corrupt strongman. Robert Mugabe was 93 when he left his seat in Harare, mired in economic collapse. Algeria's President finally resigned. Will that be enough to quell protests? In Algeria, Abdelaziz Bouteflika was 82 when he resigned, having barely been seen in public since a 2013 stroke, setting an all-new low bar for a dictator's interaction with his regime. And Omar al-Bashir, forced out by the military this week at the age of 75, let living standards fall inexorably after three decades of repressing Sudan. He's also wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. None had the ability or desire to relate to the young populations rising up to demand their removal. None had militaries willing to sustain them anymore or, for the most part, use violence on protesters. But the world has evolved, perhaps slipping backwards, since 2011 -- more cynical, less ideological in its centers of power. We witness these changes less enamored with the aspirations for a better life that are keeping many in Algeria and Sudan still out, protesting, as their dictators' successors measure up for curtains in the palace. Read More The Arab Spring's momentum emerged after years of doubt in Western processes, fueled by the disastrous Iraq war. Suddenly, despite how deeply discredited the West and its democracies had found themselves, Tunisians and Egyptians wanted little other than more freedom, and would take risks to get it. The Obama administration somehow saw part of its agenda for change as reflected in this inevitable shaking of the regional carpet, and fomented it. The internet made this desire for change real, new and immediate for anyone who cared to see it. The 22-year-old activist in that iconic photo says she chanted from atop a car to declare, 'Sudan is for all' Today we are older, if not necessarily wiser. In 2011, social media was the catalyst. Yet now, as we admire the image of a Sudanese woman, Alaa Salah, in flowing white tobe and gold moon earrings, standing on a car and addressing the crowd, she is surrounded by a sea of smartphone screens capturing her bravery. That is the norm, an accepted part of life. Videos of brutality or defiance aren't so much cause for viewers to pause in horror or awe of their contents anymore, but instead tend to incite Twitter spats about their authenticity. But the most significant change in the past eight years is in the White House and Brussels. Places that once stood tall, demanding that outdated and unjust dictators heed the will of the streets, are too absorbed by their own rifts now to forcefully articulate convictions. The US State Department's Deputy Spokesman Robert Palladino has said meekly that the ""Sudanese people should determine who leads them"" and should have quicker elections than those currently planned -- hardly a strident and supportive speech from the Rose Garden. Similar noises have been made about Algeria, despite the interim president Abdelkader Bensalah -- who has pledged elections in three months -- hailing from the same ""pouvoir,"" or social elite, that enabled Bouteflika for two decades. Tear gas and further demonstrations will follow, even if the European Union has too much on its internal plate to speak up louder than the usual call for free and fair elections. Trump claims his Syria strategy hasn't changed Those eight years have given us reasons to see strongmen successors as the lesser of some evils and, you could argue, mean that Western leaders are more silent due to experience. The turmoil of Libya, unable to find peace or coherent government since 2011, has spawned a human trafficking nightmare for exploited migrants on their way to Europe, along with an ISIS affiliate. The Syrian people's hasty bid to replicate Tunisia's peaceful change led to al Qaeda and ISIS taking partial hold, hundreds of thousands dead, the use of sarin gas on babies, Russia's brute force emerging as a new totem in the Middle East, and the dark reassurance of Bashar al-Assad that his father's savage ways will win out. Egypt went full circle, veering wildly off towards Islamist leadership after the fall of Hosni Mubarak, and then after an unspeakably brutal military crackdown, back into a dictatorship likely worse than that which brought Egyptians out in Tahrir Square in 2011. But the vectors that led us to change in 2011 and 2019 are the same. People are younger, poorer, less equal and slowly hotter, hungrier and thirstier before. These are problems that exacerbate each other, and while strongmen always stand in the way of progress, rare is the successor who offers a new path forward."
Louisiana churches fire: Pastors relieved after arrest and ready for healing to begin,edition.cnn.com,"Christina Maxouris, Samira Said",04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/louisiana-church-fires-saturday/index.html,"(CNN) Pastor Harry Richard is ready to help his community begin healing.
The pastor led the Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas before it was burned to the ground on April 2. Just a week earlier, St. Mary Baptist Church in Porte Barre had been set ablaze, and on April 4, Mount Pleasant Baptist Church was the last to burn. Louisiana arson suspect expressed disgust with Baptist churches on Facebook Authorities have arrested Holden Matthews, 21, in connection with the church fires that terrified the communities in Louisiana. ""Now, my concern is when do we get back to normal,"" Richard told CNN affiliate KLFY. ""When do we put our church family back in their home?"" Suspect allegedly influenced by music Read More Matthews is charged with three counts of simple arson on a religious building, State Fire Marshal H. ""Butch"" Browning said. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 15 years. The suspect has no history of violence or prior arrests, and he may have been influenced by ""black metal"" music and its ""associated history with church burnings,"" authorities said. Browning confirmed the fires were intentionally set. The suspect's father is a local sheriff's deputy who broke down when he found out about Matthew's involvement with the fires, St. Landry Parish Sheriff Bobby Guidroz said. ""He was shocked and hurt as any father would be,"" Guidroz said. ""He was in terrible shape."" Browning says they're not looking for any other suspects, but the investigation is still ongoing. ""I was hoping that this is the only individual involved and that now we can start healing,"" Richard told KLFY. ""I'm excited for what God is going to do in the community."" A time for recovery Congregants have been attending service in nearby churches and their leaders are ready to begin the recovery process. ""It started off a dark moment in our lives, but with the rebuilding process you're going to see some things ... that are going to be very bright for our churches,"" Mount Pleasant Baptist Church Pastor Gerald Toussaint said. Pastor Easton Shelvin of Truth is Ministries told KLFY the way forward for the community is prayer and an increase in faith. ""People who trust in God really need to see God is allowing things to happen to catch our attention,"" he told the affiliate. ""I think God set us up to be a great light right now."" Their church was burning. They linked arms and prayed He said he believes people who ""do those kinds of acts are lost and searching for attention."" CNN learned Matthews had previously expressed disgust with Baptist beliefs on Facebook. Responding to a post about ""afrikan spirituality,"" Matthews, posting under the name Noctis Matthews, said he cannot ""stand all these baptists around here, bunch of brainwashed people trying to find happiness in a religion that was forced on their ancestors just as it was on mine."" He also said he wished that ""most blacks [sic] people would look into ancient beliefs of pre Christian Africa."" CNN reached out to Matthews' lawyer and the prosecutor's office but have not yet received a response. When CNN asked authorities if they were aware of the posting, they said because the investigation was ongoing, they would not detail any particular leads they are following. Following the clues According to a court affidavit, it was the charred remains of a Scepter-branded, gallon gas can that led authorities to Matthews. Surveillance cameras captured a pick up truck believed to have been driven by Matthews minutes before the Greater Union Baptist Church caught on fire. The gas can was discovered by federal ATF agents on Tuesday at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, the affidavit said. Investigators learned that a Walmart in Opelousas was a local seller of the Scepter-branded can. Congregants were 'robbed of their sacred space' but not ruined. The story behind this photo Walmart then informed the investigators two cans were purchased on March 25 -- less than 3 hours before the first fire -- along with a 10-pack of automotive cloths and a lighter, the affidavit states. The receipt showed the purchase was made with a debit card in the name of Holden Matthews. Investigators also obtained surveillance photos of the purchaser and the pickup he was driving. The affidavit said a Ford pickup like the one Matthews was driving was registered to the suspect's father. Matthews' cell phone was traced to the area of the fires."

He was working to fortify a foxhole when a heavy beam came flying off a truck and struck him in the head. The injury not only ended his military career, it left him fighting for his life and later, battling PTSD and depression. Vallieres couldn't work but he could volunteer, and he spotted a New Hampshire Audubon ad looking for help tracking peregrine falcons and bald eagles, whose populations had once fallen from insecticide use.

"Survey: As many Americans claim no religion as there are evangelicals, Catholics",edition.cnn.com,"Neil Monahan and Saeed Ahmed, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/no-religion-largest-group-first-time-usa-trnd/index.html,"Programming note: To learn more about megachurches, watch "" United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell "" on Sunday at 10 p.m. ET/PT. (CNN) For the first time ""No Religion"" has topped a survey of Americans' religious identity, according to a new analysis by a political scientist. The non-religious edged out Catholics and evangelicals in the long-running General Social Survey.
Ryan Burge, a political scientist at Eastern Illinois University and a Baptist pastor, found that 23.1% of Americans now claim no religion. Catholics came in at 23.0%, and evangelicals were at 22.5%. The three groups remain within the margin of error of each other though, making it a statistical tie. Over 2,000 people were interviewed in person for the survey. A growing number of Americans reject organized religion Pope Francis leaves the Basilica of SantAnselmo on March 6, 2019 in Rome. Read More ""Religious nones,"" as they are called by researchers, are a diverse group made up of atheists, agnostics, the spiritual, and those who are no specific organized religion in particular. A rejection of organized religion is the common thread they share. ""It is the first time we have seen this. The same questions have been asked for 44 years,"" Burge told CNN. The meteoric rise of religious nones began in the early 1990s and has grown 266% since 1991, he said. Burge estimates that 'No Religion' will be the largest group outright in four to six years. The reasons why the numbers explode d Richard Dawkins posing for an atheist advertising campaign Experts still debate the factors behind this wave of Americans declaring no religion. One reason could be the internet, says Nick Fish, the president of American Atheists. It provides a place for nonbelievers to find each other. ""The ease of access to the internet helped build communities where they didn't feel alone,"" he says. Robyn Blumner, executive director of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science, sees the change as a generational trend driven by millennials. ""We are seeing the rise of a generation of Americans who are hungry for facts and curious about the world,"" she says. They are an underrepresented group Whatever the causes, the non-religious represent a growing constituency. Yet this demographic is greatly underrepresented in Washington's halls of power. There is not a single open atheist amid the most diverse Congress in history, according to a Pew study . The Congressional Freethought Caucus's 10 members try to represent non-theist interests while protecting the secular character of government. ""This growing group of Americans can feel like there is at least some people in Congress who believe they matter."" says the co-chair and founder, Rep. Jared Huffman of California."
British MPs urge government to extradite Julian Assange to Sweden,edition.cnn.com,Arnaud Siad and Bianca Britton,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/uk/julian-assange-sweden-allegations-british-mps-gbr-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) British lawmakers have urged their government to hand WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over to authorities in Sweden if that country reopens its investigation into rape and sexual assault allegations and requests his extradition.
In the letter sent on Friday to Home Secretary Sajid Javid, which was tweeted by Labour politician Stella Creasy, more than 70 MPs called on him ""to stand with the victims of sexual violence."" They added that ""the UK should tell Sweden that it will have our full cooperation"" if they choose to reopen the rape case against Assange.

— stellacreasy (@stellacreasy) April 12, 2019 The MPs note that the investigation in Sweden was ""discontinued only because of Assange's unavailability"" while he was inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Assange was arrested on Thursday by British police after spending seven years holed inside the embassy. However, much of the coverage focused on the US request for his extradition on a single charge of conspiring with former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to steal military secrets. Why did Ecuador give up Assange after seven years? Read More While it is clear that there was a degree of co-ordination between UK and US authorities ahead of Assange's arrest , as the US indictment was unsealed shortly afterward, the Swedes knew nothing of it. Some commentators have expressed surprise that the country wasn't given notice, especially as Assange sought political asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy on June 19, 2012 when he had lost his UK Supreme Court appeal against extradition to Sweden. Assange denies the Swedish allegations, which have a limitation period that expires in August 2020. After news broke that Assange had been arrested, the lawyer for the woman who accused him of rape tweeted that she and her client were shocked, but said they'd been hoping for it since 2012. ""We are going to do everything we possibly can to get the Swedish police investigation re-opened so that Assange can be extradited to Sweden and prosecuted for rape,"" lawyer Elisabeth Massi Fritz tweeted. ""No rape victim should have to wait 9 years to see justice be served."" We are going to do everything we possibly can to get the swedish police investigation re-opened so that Assange can be extradited to Sweden and prosecuted for rape. No rape victim should have to wait 9 years to see justice be served.
— Elisabeth Massi Fritz (@ElisabethMFritz) April 11, 2019 Sweden's Prosecution Authority said Thursday they were considering reopening the investigation against Assange. If the country does decide to go ahead and submit its own extradition request, it would be up to UK courts to decide on whether it should take precedence over the expected petition from the US. Regardless, Assange will have to serve any prison sentence for skipping bail in 2012 for the sexual assault and rape allegations, which a judge will determine at a later date. Julian Assange arriving at Westminster Magistrates court on April 11. Former Conservative Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt told the BBC that the way the sexual assault allegations have been minimized is ""quite disturbing."" ""You read the testimony and concerns of the women who have been involved, I have no view on the matter because it must come before a court, but it seems essential to me that he should face justice for what he has been accused of,"" Burt said. ""Either to acquit him, or to see him appropriately convicted."" Former Labour Lord Falconer also told the BBC that it was up to the courts to decide, not politicians. ""I don't think politicians should be saying he should or should not be... extradited,"" he said. Assange held at high security prison A member of WikiLeaks told CNN that Assange is being held at London's Belmarsh prison, which is known for holding high-profile terror suspects such as Abu Hamza and Anjem Choudary . Her Majesty's Prison Belmarsh in Thamesmead, southeast London, is one of only three high-security local prisons in England and Wales. Belmarsh prison has housed some of Britain's most notorious inmates. According to the British government, it is the most high profile prison in the UK and includes a high security unit (HSU), in effect a prison within a prison, where some of the highest-risk prisoners in the country are held. The Category A prison holds both men and young adults. Man believed to be an Assange associate arrested In the latest developments related to Assange, Ecuador's prosecutor's office said they seized items ""such as computer equipment, cell phones, storage devices, books related to electronic hacking, money, among others"" of a Swedish citizen who was arrested at Quito airport on Thursday. The prosecutor's office released images of the search carried out at the home of the 36-year-old Swedish citizen who has been living in Ecuador for five years. Ecuador says he is an expert in the development of technology linked to security, privacy and cryptography and was planning to travel to Japan. Ecuador's prosecutor's office shared images of the items confiscated after a a search was carried out at the home of a Swedish citizen. While the prosecutor's office did not name the Swedish man, he fits the profile of a Julian Assange associate arrested at Quito airport who CNN has identified as Ola Bini. In a further statement on Saturday, it said the Swedish citizen's bank accounts had been frozen, and he will be prosecuted for the alleged crime of attacking the integrity of computer systems."
"Capturing a black hole, living in space and a new human relative: This week in space and science",edition.cnn.com,Ashley Strickland,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/world/black-hole-twins-study-week-space-science-scn/index.html,"(CNN) This week, scientists shared the very first photo of a supermassive black hole, and the much-anticipated final results of NASA's Twins Study researching longterm spaceflight's effect on the human body were released.
And that's not all. The fossils of a previously unknown human relative were discovered in a cave. Scientists found an exoplanet and considered how life might thrive on other exoplanets. Declassified U2 spy plane images revealed archeological features lost to time. And unfortunately, a mission to the moon ended by crashing into it. Here's everything you might have missed this week in the world of space and science news. Einstein was right (again) Read More On Wednesday, the world was introduced to the first photo of a black hole . And then a million memes erupted, tagging such phenomena as the eye of Sauron from ""Lord of the Rings"" and suggesting cats as the real cause. The supermassive black hole resides at the center of the galaxy M87, 55 million light-years from us. It's now been named Powehi , a Hawaiian phrase referring to an ""embellished dark source of unending creation."" Scientists used a global network of eight telescopes called the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration that effectively created an Earth-size telescope. In the image, a central dark region is encapsulated by a ring of light that looks brighter on one side. The first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole. It acts as confirmation of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. And then the world was introduced to the smiling face of Katie Bouman . The monumental effort of capturing this image and sharing it with the world wouldn't have been possible without Bouman, who developed a crucial algorithm that helped devise imaging methods. Katie Bouman and the image she helped make possible. MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab compared a photo of Bouman among stacks of hard drives to a famous 1969 photo of computer scientist Margaret Hamilton standing next to the thousands of sheets of code she and her team wrote for the Apollo Project.

— MIT CSAIL (@MIT_CSAIL) April 10, 2019 After great triumph comes failure The first privately funded mission to the moon, Israel's Beresheet spacecraft, was attempting to perform a soft landing on the moon when it crashed Thursday. Israeli spacecraft crashes in final moments before moon landing ""I am sorry to say that our spacecraft did not make it in one piece to the moon,"" said Opher Doron, the manager of Israel Aerospace Industries' Space Division. ""We made it all the way to the moon. This is a great accomplishment. We are the seventh country to make it all the way to the moon."" The mission launched in February with great fanfare. The failure is believed to be due to a communication issue. What happens when you spend a year in space? In case you were wondering, a lot. Spending 340 days aboard the International Space Station between 2015 and 2016 caused changes in astronaut Scott Kelly's body, from his weight down to his genes, according to the results of the NASA Twins Study, released Thursday. The majority of changes in Kelly's body, compared with his identical brother, Mark, on Earth, returned to normal once he came back from the space station. The study results suggest that human health can be ""mostly sustained"" for a year in space, the researchers said. But the much-anticipated study reveals areas that may require countermeasures or safeguards when preparing for longer space missions or missions to deep space, like Mars. Human health can be 'mostly sustained' for a year in space, NASA Twins Study concludes A year in space caused Scott's carotid artery to thicken, damage to his DNA, changes in gene expression, a thickening of the retina, shifts in gut microbes, reduced cognitive abilities and a structural change at the ends of chromosomes, called telomeres. But it did not alter or mutate his DNA. Getting a flu shot in space also worked exactly as it did on Earth. Nutrition and exercise on the station caused weight loss and an increase in folic acid that caused the vital production of red blood cells. The findings have health implications not only for astronauts who may endure longterm missions to Mars and elsewhere but for those of us here on Earth who aren't considering going off-planet. Cancer patients also undergo genetic changes and radiation exposure. This study shows how a healthy body responds and adapts to stress, which could separate out how the body responds to other stressors, cancer or infections. Meet Homo luzonensis Together, 13 bones found in Callao Cave in the Philippines represent our only knowledge of a newly discovered species related to humans called Homo luzonensis. The fossils belonged to two adults and one child who lived between 50,000 and 67,000 years ago. This time frame means luzonensis would have lived at the same time as Neanderthals, Denisovans, Homo sapiens and the small-bodied Homo floresiensis. Like other extinct hominins, luzonensis is more of a close relative than a direct ancestor. A mysterious species related to humans has been discovered No DNA was extracted from the hand and foot bones or teeth, but the fossils contain an intriguing mix of archaic and progressive traits that can be traced to Homo sapiens as well as Australopithecus afarensis. Australopithecus lived between 2.9 million and 3.9 million years ago. More research is on the horizon, and then we may have a better idea of what they looked like and how they lived. Spy planes: The new archaeological tool Time, weather and human interference tend to erase important markers of the past. But enterprising scientists were able to get their hands on images captured by U2 spy planes that are now declassified and public. In the 1950s and '60s, the planes flew over the Middle East, Europe and parts of Asia to take photos of military targets. But the cameras kept taking photos in between targets, recording desert, fields and villages. Researchers went through thousands of frames. What they found were archaeological features that can no longer be seen, including prehistoric hunting traps, 3,000-year-old canals and 60-year-old marsh villages that disappeared when they were drained. The hunting traps, called desert kites, were stone structures between 5,000 to 8,000 years old that trapped gazelles and other animals. One of the U2 spy plane photos used to show evidence of hunting traps. The images also provide a look at Aleppo before the Syrian civil war destroyed so much of it, the researchers said. This is the first time U2 spy plane imagery has been used archaeologically, but the researchers are hoping it's just the beginning now that the resources are available to all. Life could be on these exoplanets A team of Brazilian astronomers found evidence of an exoplanet that orbited a binary, or two-star system, in which one of the stars is dead. The giant exoplanet also happens to have the mass nearly 13 times that of Jupiter. So it wouldn't be the best place to set up shop. There's been a lot of scientific excitement in recent years about rocky Earth-like planets orbiting small red dwarf stars close to our solar system. The planets found around these stars have been within the habitable zone, where liquid water could exist on the surface of the planets and life could potentially exist. But then that excitement was squished by radiation. These planets also happen to be close to their stars, and even though the stars are small, they have a nasty habit of flaring and basically lashing their planets with big doses of radiation. That doesn't exactly sound friendly to life or an atmosphere. But this week, researchers reminded us that Earth went through a similar phase, and hey, we're still here. Early on in Earth's history, life had to withstand heavy UV radiation. This could be happening on Proxima-b , TRAPPIST-1e , Ross 128 b and LHS 1140b . ""Given that the early Earth was inhabited,"" the researchers wrote, ""we show that UV radiation should not be a limiting factor for the habitability of planets orbiting [small red dwarf] stars. Our closest neighboring worlds remain intriguing targets for the search for life beyond our solar system."""
The world's largest plane is about to fly for the first time,edition.cnn.com,Thom Patterson,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/business/stratolaunch-worlds-largest-plane/index.html,"(CNN) After years of development in the desert north of Los Angeles, a gigantic, six-engined mega jet with the wingspan of an American football field flew Saturday morning for the first time.
""We finally did it,"" said Stratolaunch Systems CEO Jean Floyd at a news conference from the hangar at Mojave Air & Space Port. ""It was an emotional moment to watch this bird take flight."" Stratolaunch, the company founded in 2011 by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, conducted the first test flight of the world's largest plane. ""I had imagined this moment for years, but I had never imagined it without Paul standing next to me,"" Floyd said, adding that he whispered a private ""thank-you"" to Allen as the plane took flight. Allen died last October at age 65 from complications related to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Read More In simple terms, the Stratolaunch aircraft is a giant flying launch pad, designed to hurtle satellites into low Earth orbit. It aims to offer the military, private companies and even NASA itself a more economical way to get into space. The company's business model calls for getting satellites into space ""as easy as booking an airline flight."" Test pilot Evan Thomas flew the jet to speeds of about 173 mph, climbing as high as 15,000 feet before returning smoothly and safely back, after a nearly two-and-a-half-hour flight. ""For the most part, the plane flew as predicted,"" said Thomas, a former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot. ""It was overall fantastic. I honestly could not have hoped for more on a first flight, especially of an airplane of this complexity and this uniqueness."" The world's biggest plane's wingspan measures longer than a football field. The aircraft's wingspan measures 385 feet -- wider than any airplane on the planet. From tip to tail, it's 238 feet long. It weighs half a million pounds. It's so big, it has two cockpits, one in each fuselage (but only one is used to fly the plane.) ""It's the world's biggest airplane. It's so huge, it seems like it shouldn't be able to fly,"" Jack Beyer, an aerospace and launch photographer for NASASpaceFlight.com , told CNN on Thursday. He's excited to witness the beginnings of the space industry's rising trend: using jets to launch satellites. Dozens of photographers, industry bloggers and aerospace enthusiasts gathered this week to glimpse the unique twin-fuselage plane. ""People are interested in the first flight of Stratolaunch because they want to see the future,"" Beyer said. ""It's the same reason why people tune in each year to watch the Apple keynotes. People want to see what's next."" A jet, carrying a rocket, carrying a satellite Here's how Stratolaunch is supposed to work once the plane is fully tested and certified: The jet, carrying a rocket loaded with a satellite, will take off from Mojave and climb to an altitude of 35,000 feet. There, pilots will launch the rocket from the plane on a trajectory toward space. The plane then will land safety back at Mojave, while the rocket carries the satellite into an orbit ranging from about 300 miles to 1,200 miles above Earth. The rocket deploys the satellite before eventually falling back to Earth, burning up in the sky like a meteor. Although the cost of the airplane hasn't been made public, other details are known. To make it both strong and lightweight, Stratolaunch is made largely of carbon fiber material instead of aluminum. To save money on designing new engines and landing gear, the jet is powered by six Pratt & Whitney engines, which were originally designed for Boeing 747s. Its landing gear, which includes a mind-boggling 28 wheels, was also first designed for 747s.
The jet's landing gear has 28 wheels. Satellites in low Earth orbit can provide communications and broadband internet connectivity to remote areas on the ground. They can conduct valuable Earth observation and surveillance. The market for commercial satellite launch services is growing rapidly and is expected to reach $7 billion by 2024, according to Global Market Insights . Putting small satellites into space via airplanes also promises to be cheaper than traditional rocket launches because it eliminates the need for launch pads and all the pricey equipment and infrastructure surrounding a traditional rocket launch. It also can save on fuel costs, because the plane burns less fuel than a traditional rocket when it blasts off from Earth. Other benefits: Bad weather won't be as much of a problem. Storms can delay a traditional rocket launch, but a jet could simply take off and fly over bad weather -- or around it -- and then launch the satellite. Launches could take place more frequently and within a faster time frame. No more waiting in line for a slot to open up on a spacecraft blasting off from a traditional terrestrial launch pad. Competition from Richard Branson Though Stratolaunch has only flown once, it's already facing competition from billionaire Richard Branson and his Virgin Orbit company. Its LauncherOne service wants to fling rockets carrying satellites into orbit from a customized Boeing 747-400 -- which, unlike Stratolaunch, is a proven aircraft. Virgin Orbit plans to conduct its first launch at Mojave Air & Space Port sometime ""in the middle of the year."" ""We are well on our way towards providing new launch opportunities for small satellites that have waited too long for their ride to space,"" Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart said Wednesday in a statement . Virgin Orbit plans to use a customized Boeing 747-400 to compete with Stratolaunch. What's next Stratolaunch pops a wheelie during January's high-speed taxi test. Stratolaunch's first flight presents the company with a new set of hoops to jump through before it can start doing business. Pilots will have to test fly the jet many more times before it can be checked and certified by the Federal Aviation Administration. If all goes as planned, Stratolaunch said the plane is expected to launch its first satellite sometime next year."

Pete Buttigieg pushed a plan to revitalize South Bend. Not everyone felt its benefits. - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Dan Merica,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/pete-buttigieg-south-bend-record/index.html,"South Bend, Indiana (CNN) Stacey Odom was skeptical of Pete Buttigieg, when, in 2012, he became the young mayor here in South Bend.
Then 29-year-old Buttigieg won office on a plan of urban revitalization and data-driven governance. Newsweek had recently tagged South Bend as one of America's dying cities. So he laid out a plan: Get rid of urban blight, revitalize downtown and attract the kind of economy that had eluded South Bend ever since the car manufacturer Studebaker left town decades before, leaving a gaping hole -- both physically and mentally -- in the city of just over 100,000 Hoosiers. But for Odom, who is black and more than a decade older than Buttigieg, the mayor's primary idea for getting rid of urban decay -- expediting code enforcement in order to demolish 1,000 deteriorating houses in 1,000 days -- smacked of gentrification and reignited racial tensions in the city. ""I thought it was a mistake,"" Odom said outside a home she is trying to redevelop in the Monroe neighborhood. ""I don't think that he looked at every aspect of all the consequences of tearing down 1,000 homes in 1,000 days."" Read More Pence says Buttigieg bringing 'attacks on my Christian faith' With Buttigieg planning to officially launch his presidential bid in South Bend on Sunday, his record as mayor has come under scrutiny, with questions being raised about whether the city's revitalization has delivered for all of Sound Bend's denizens. And now that Buttigieg is leaving office to focus on his campaign, the race to replace him has turned into a tacit acknowledgment that the renewal, while popular, has not been felt by all residents. Candidates for mayor have all pledged to focus on revitalizing the city's neighborhoods like downtown; Jason Critchlow , a onetime political operative, is running ads saying that ""it's time to take the success we have had here ... to all over this city."" Buttigieg is set to make his eight years as mayor central to his presidential bid, especially the renewal that he has delivered to the small city. But as much as some residents of South Bend have touted the newly revitalized downtown, others -- primarily those from historically African American areas west of downtown -- have expressed reservations over how the renewal was not felt in their neighborhoods. Buttigieg, in an interview with CNN, said that ""overall"" he believes the program was ""certainly a success"" and ""primarily benefited low-income and minority homeowners who found that their safety and their property value was damaged by blight."" But the mayor admitted that the plan was not perfect and needed to be tweaked throughout based on feedback from neighborhoods where blight is the most apparent. ""The challenge with any policy, especially a controversial one, is you need to know when to stick to your guns when you really believe in something and get it done. But you also need to acknowledge, from the get-go, that you might be wrong,"" Buttigieg said, adding that the lessons he learned from these sorts of controversial projects have informed the kind of candidacy he is mounting for president. Winning people over The 1,000-home project -- coupled with all the time, energy and money Buttigieg committed to revitalizing downtown -- created distrust with some of South Bend's African American residents, who make up nearly 30% of the city's population. Much of that has yet to be fully resolved. The current unemployment rate among African Americans in South Bend is more than 11%, and a 2017 study by the city found that more than 40% of African Americans in the city live below the poverty line, a number that is nearly double the national rate for black households. But eight years removed from Buttigieg taking office, what has surprised many in South Bend -- including those who met Buttigieg's early plans with antipathy -- is that the mayor has won over many of his critics, including Odom and Republicans who had once questioned whether he could effectively lead their city. Odom's opinion of Buttigieg changed after a chance -- and blunt -- meeting downtown. Her home was on the demolition list and she wanted it off but was hitting roadblocks with the city. ""I saw Mayor Pete walking down the street, and I'm one of those people that if I see you somewhere, I don't care who you are, and I need something, I'll just run right up to you and ask you for what I want,"" Odom said with a laugh, recalling how she confronted the mayor. Odom was surprised that Buttigieg listened for 10 minutes, even though he was on his way to a meeting. His staff was anxious to get Buttigieg to move on, but the mayor handed her his card and the two struck up an ongoing conversation. Buttigieg later held a series of meeting with Odom and others to talk about the plan. She credits the mayor with getting her home off the demolition list -- and because of pressure from the community, 40% of other residents' homes were taken off too. ""When I saw that he was willing to help, that's what turned me,"" said Odom. ""That's what said to me, this is a man that has the potential to be president."" Buttigieg said it was experiences like the one he had with Odom that informed a facet of his approach to 2020. ""On one hand, I believe in conviction politics. I think you need to forcefully defend your values and explain why you believe in the things you believe in,"" he said. ""But one reason that you'll hear me not being too doctrinaire about some of these policy groups is an awareness that the reality in government is you're going to be adjusting the finer points of the policy, anyway."" 'Everybody wants a beautiful community, but ...' Regina Williams-Preston had a markedly different experience. She and her husband had bought three dilapidated houses in her neighborhood with plans to refurbish them and either sell them for a profit or create a business, like a day care for local kids. But when Williams-Preston's husband fell ill and was unable to renovate the houses, the properties landed on the city's demolition list and the family lost the properties that they had hoped would be investments. ""What was different was that (South Bend) condensed the project and the process of eliminating homes into a very short period of time,"" Williams-Preston said. ""Oftentimes when you try to do something really fast, you miss things. ... There was just this real concerted effort to make sure we hit that goal. Like anything that came in the way we had to change policy, we got it done so we can hit that target. But in the wake of that, people lost homes."" Pete Buttigieg's unlikely rise as a symbol of LGBT progress The experience lit a fire under Williams-Preston, who went on to create a group of local organizers that has become a force pushing against the Buttigieg administration. She then successfully ran for South Bend Common Council, the city council, in 2015 and is now running for mayor, looking to replace the man who motivated her to get into politics. Around South Bend, the effects of the demolition program are impossible to miss. Semi-urban blocks that were once packed with homes, particularly on the city's west side, now look more sparsely populated, with multiple lots in between remaining homes. The need for less housing was a byproduct of economic contraction in the city -- something that many similar municipalities have experienced -- but it has left a visible hole in certain neighborhoods. People close to Buttigieg say the urban blight project was a learning experience for him. In his pre-campaign memoir, ""Shortest Way Home,"" Buttigieg touted the project as a win for ""data-driven management."" But even he has recently admitted that it wasn't flawless. And government executives who worked closely with Buttigieg admit that the program did impact communities of color more directly, even though that wasn't the intention. ""It has had some disproportionate impact"" on minority communities, Gary Gilot, the president of Buttigieg's Board of Public Works, said in an interview. ""But the decision was color-blind. ... It was the right thing to do to deal with the blight. You have to remove it. If you have a cancer, you have to deal with it."" The complaints about the program from neighborhoods outside South Bend's city center were compounded by Buttigieg pouring resources and time into stimulating downtown, which created a sense that the mayor was focused on downtown at the expense of nearby communities. ""More resources could flow out into neighborhoods now that the downtown is becoming more vital,"" said Steve Fredman, a retired English professor who was close with the Buttigieg family long before the mayor was even born. ""And that is a campaign issue for people who are running (for mayor) right now."" In total, Buttigieg touts $850 million in investments since he took office in 2012. But people, like Williams-Preston, who remain uneasy about the mayor say much of that money flowed everywhere but the most impoverished communities. ""Everybody wants a beautiful community,"" she said, standing in LaSalle Park, the neighborhood that was changed by the program. ""But how can we do that in a way that doesn't push out poor people and people of color?"" Buttigieg said he sees complaints like the one leveled by Williams-Preston as ""expression of concern about inequality."" ""This is a city which is still a low-income city and one with a lot of inequality. So if you're on the west side, and I'm proud of everything we've done for the west side, but you're still in a low-income neighborhood,"" Buttigieg said. ""So anything that you see happening downtown could be perceived as something that you wish were coming to you."" He added: ""My job is to balance it out, knowing that we're going to have economic growth for the whole city if we have a strong urban core in the downtown, but at the same time not falling into some trickle-down fantasy that if we get that right, everybody's going to automatically be better off."" Stay awhile The heart of Buttigieg's plan for downtown was restructuring what has been a dilapidated city center: Upgrade the sidewalks, improve medians and give government grants to refurbish old buildings. But the most unique change was getting rid of one-way streets and five-lane boulevards that encouraged people to speed through downtown without a thought about the businesses in the area. Not everyone was in favor of the plan, which promised to also create more traffic in downtown South Bend. ""You tell your husband to stop (messing up) the streets downtown,"" a constituent told Buttigieg's husband, Chasten, in the grocery store one day, using an expletive, the mayor writes in his memoir. People close to the mayor told CNN that residents regularly used listening sessions that came to be known as ""Mayor's Night Out"" to vent. He would ""go face the piper at these Mayor Night Out things and people get a few minutes to vent their spleen,"" said Gilot, who added that sometimes the comments could get profane and gruff. Since then, however, the plan, according to nearly every South Bend resident CNN spoke to, has worked to revitalize downtown but has also made traffic worse. South Bend's downtown, while small, is bustling and now home to a number of locally owned businesses and restaurants. No one has seen this change more than Mark McDonnell, the owner of LaSalle Grill, a local downtown spot that opened 28 years ago. ""We had the problem of people blasting through south and north on five-lane roads, one-way, with no intention of stopping in South Bend, and it was just always a constant problem,"" said McDonnell, who -- despite being a Republican -- met with Buttigieg during his first run for mayor and told him that downtown looks like a ""drab ... Soviet-era city in the 1950s."" Buttigieg wants to 'change the channel' from Washington's 'mesmerizing horror show' In response, Buttigieg launched ""Smart Streets"" in 2013 and got the $25 million bond needed for it in 2015. ""This is the heart of the city,"" McDonnell said. ""The neighborhoods may be the soul of the city, but this is the heart, got to have a pumping heart to have anything else."" What makes McDonnell's story unique is that the eccentric business owner was skeptical of Buttigieg at first and, despite his affinity for the mayor, he voted for Donald Trump in 2016. As he approaches 2020 and the prospect of Buttigieg being the Democratic nominee, McDonnell's onetime skepticism of the mayor has given way to possible support. ""He would be at this point the only Democrat that I would consider voting for, I'll put it that way,"" McDonnell said. ""I don't totally agree with him on all the issues he has. ... (But) if we are to have a Democrat president, and chances are good, I would rather have somebody that was from South Bend."" ""I know I'll get a bunch of emails from friends after they see this, 'What are you thinking!' Well, I have to think what's best for South Bend, Indiana, the country, and Pete may be the best choice."""
Here's who's winning under Trump's tax law - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/tax-reform-winners-and-losers/index.html,"(CNN) Tax day isn't until Monday, but there have already been some surprises for Americans filing their first income tax returns under President Donald Trump's 2017 law.
Let's start with the big one. While most Americans are paying less in taxes overall, many have been startled to find that their refunds have barely changed or are down -- making them feel like they lost, even if they're still coming out ahead. Below are some other ways to look at who is winning and losing under the law. And please take note: It's possible to both win and lose at the same time. Winning: Most US taxpayers The vast majority of American tax filers -- more than 65% -- will see their overall tax burden decrease by at least $100, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. See page 7 of this helpful analysis . Read More Slightly less than 30% of filers will see very little change in their tax liability and a small percentage, about 6%, will see an increase. These tax rate cuts for individual filers are not permanent like the corporate tax cuts, but they'll be in place until 2025. But while most Americans got a tax cut, most people don't seem to understand they got one. According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll out this week, only 17% of Americans think they're getting a tax cut while 28% said they will pay more. Winning: Most rich people The new tax law's benefits are tilted toward the wealthy, who will generally see greater benefits than other Americans. The largest cuts will go to the people who pay the most in tax, according to the Tax Policy Center , a think tank, which suggested that tax filers in the 95th to 99th percentile of income -- roughly between $308,000 and $733,000 -- would see the largest benefit as a portion of after-tax income. Most people in the bottom 20% income-wise will see little or no change in their tax liability, according to that report. Losing: Some rich people, probably in blue states About 14% of rich people making more than $1 million will see a tax increase. They're likely to be concentrated in states with high state and local taxes and they possibly have multiple homes. They used to be able to deduct a lot more of their state and local income taxes from their federal returns. Now those deductions are capped at $10,000. But the cap in deductions will likely hit people in the top 1% of wage earners in those states the hardest , although there will be people affected across the income spectrum. Really winning: Heirs of rich people The law more than doubled the amount that can pass to family members without triggering the estate tax , from about $5 million to more than $11 million for individuals and $22 million for married couples. That affects a relatively small number of Americans, but it means they'll be able to keep more of an estate. Still winning: Investors The rates for capital gains taxes did not change in the tax law and remain lower than the rates for wage income. So people making money primarily off investments will continue to pay less in taxes than people who depend mostly on salary income. Winning: Trump, maybe, although some other business owners won't win as much Most small business owners (and a lot of not-so-small business owners) include their profits on personal income tax returns instead of paying as corporations. Trump is presumably among these, although it's impossible to know since he has kept his tax returns from public view. Under the law, which the IRS clarified in January, certain types of business owners get a 20% tax deduction. Doctors and lawyers lost out on that exemption, however, along with Major League Baseball team owners. Winning: Red state filers who depend on refunds According to preliminary data from H&R Block, it is mostly red states, those that voted for Trump in 2016, who are getting the largest bump in tax refunds. Losing: Blue state filers who depend on refunds That H&R Block preliminary data shows that every one of the states where refunds are shrinking is blue. Of course, experts say you should aim to have no refund and no tax bill on tax day. But a lot of Americans rely on the refunds as a sort of forced savings plan. In the preliminary H&R Block data, some of the states with the largest decreases in tax liability are blue states with high state and local taxes, like New Jersey, California and Massachusetts. Filers in these high tax states averaged some of the largest tax cuts. They also saw some of the largest average decreases in refunds. Losing: People who thought a tax cut would mean a bigger refund According to preliminary 2018 tax filing season data from H&R Block , one of the nation's largest tax preparers, the average tax filing they've processed so far shows a 24.9% drop in tax liability. But because of the way the IRS changed its paycheck withholding, that cut was spread over the course of the year and refunds, on average, have barely moved. The government paid $6 billion less in refunds through March 29, according to the IRS, although the average refund, according to its data, is $2,873 and has shrunk less than 1% compared with last year. Losing: People who aren't getting a refund but maybe thought they would The government is paying out fewer refunds this year under the new tax law, according to preliminary IRS data on filings through March 29 . There have been 2.2% fewer refunds than last year, according to the IRS, but only 1.4% fewer returns processed. Winning: People doing their own taxes There was a 2.3% increase in the number of e-filed tax returns self-prepared by the filer, according to that IRS data from March 29. At more than 358 million, visits to IRS.gov are up more than 10% this year. That said, the new tax law preserves the deduction people can take for hiring an accountant (assuming they are not taking the standard deduction). Winning: People taking the standard deduction Taxes should get easier since the standard deduction nearly doubled to $12,200 for individuals and $24,400 for married couples. That means that most Americans will not itemize their tax returns and that caps on state and local tax deductions may not affect as many people as feared. Losing: Washington, DC, tax filers The capital is seeing the largest average refund drop, at 6.1%. It is also seeing the smallest decrease in average tax liability, 18% -- which is indeed a cut, but the smallest, on average, in the country. Winning forever: Corporations They got a massive rate cut, from 35% to 21%, starting in 2018 that's permanently enshrined in the new law. Losing: The US Treasury Because of all these tax cuts -- and especially the corporate cuts -- budget deficits are expected to skyrocket past $1 trillion per year starting in 2022 and stay there. With the national debt over $22 trillion, that means the US will ultimately have to make some hard choices. So enjoy that tax cut, everyone."
Democrats aren't looking for policy: Poll of the week - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Harry Enten,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/elizabeth-warren-poll-of-the-week/index.html,"(CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is from the television show The Price Is Right .
Poll of the week: A new Quinnipiac University poll of California Democratic and Democratic leaning independents finds that former Vice President Joe Biden leads a potential primary with 26%, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders at 18%, Sen. Kamala Harris at 17% and Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 7% each. Among those same voters, 23% think Bernie Sanders has the best policy ideas, while 13% think Biden and Warren have the best policy ideas. What's the point: Sanders (with his ""Medicare for All"" push ) and Warren with her numerous policy papers are putting policy at the forefront of their campaigns. Yet they both continue to trail Biden, despite near universal name recognition . Warren even trails behind Biden and Sanders in her own state. The problem for Warren and Sanders is that voters don't seem to be voting on policy. If they were, Warren and Sanders would probably be in a better position, and Biden would probably be in a worse position, as the Quinnipiac poll indicates. Read More Voters instead are prizing other qualities, such as leadership. The Quinnipiac poll shows that by a 51% to 38% margin, Democrats and Democratic leaning independents prefer someone they think would be a ""great leader"" than someone who has ""great policy ideas"". It's hard to quantify what would make a candidate a great leader, but voters still are making their judgments. When asked who they thought would make the ""best leader,"" Biden leads in the California poll with 31%. He was followed by Sanders at 18%, Harris at 13% and Warren at 7%. In other words, the topline numbers for preferences in the primary look more like who voters think would make the best leader than who they prefer on policy. Another quality voters are looking to this year is electability. Exactly how much they are looking for it depends on the question wording, though Democratic voters are clearly prizing it a lot more than in years past. There may be a case to be made against Warren's electability , but this is another variable that's hard to quantify. Still, voters are making their own call of who they see as electable. An Iowa poll out this week from Monmouth University gets at the heart of the issue pretty clearly. Likely Democratic caucusgoers were asked whether they prefer a candidate who aligned with them on the issues but could have a tough time beating President Donald Trump or a candidate who didn't agree with them on most issues but had a better shot at beating Trump. By a 64% to 24% margin, they wanted the candidate who had a better chance of beating Trump. Electability plays right into Biden's hands. Among likely caucusgoers, he leads Sanders 27% to 16% overall. Warren is well back in fourth at 7%. Biden's lead is because of voters who prize electability over issue alignment. Among those voters, he is up 33% to 13% over Sanders. Now look at the horserace: Among those who favor issue agreement over electability, Biden falls back to 15%. He actually trails Sanders, who leads with 19%. The lesson here is pretty clear: The way to beat Biden in the Democratic primary season isn't to show he is out-of-step with the electorate on issues. If that were the way forward, Biden would probably already be losing. Rather, the way you beat Biden if you're a Democratic candidate for president is by, among other things, proving that he isn't a good leader and can't beat Trump. If other Democratic candidates are unable to do this, then Biden will likely be the Democratic nominee."
Cory Booker kicks off two-week national tour with Newark rally - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Rebecca Buck,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/cory-booker-rally-2020/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Over the past two months, since his buzzy launch February 1, Sen. Cory Booker's campaign has gone relatively quiet — methodically grinding away under the guiding philosophy: ""You've got to organize, and get hot at the end.""
""We're trying to win the election,"" Booker's campaign manager Addisu Demissie told reporters Thursday. ""We're not trying to win a news cycle."" But that slow-and-steady pace now seems poised to pick up. Booker will step back into the spotlight Saturday in Newark, with his first major rally as a candidate. The event will kick off a two-week national tour for Booker, which in its first week will take him to Iowa, Georgia and Nevada. In his remarks, he will lay out his broad vision for the country, oriented around the theme of creating a more just society. It also comes at a moment of trial, with Booker's momentum apparently stalling after a muted start. In two polls released this week, by Monmouth University out of Iowa and St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, Booker's support registered in the low single-digits, lagging behind half a dozen other candidates. Read More Those numbers follow a middling first fundraising quarter for the New Jersey senator, who reported raising $5 million — enough to sustain a campaign operation, but far less than top fundraisers Bernie Sanders ($18.9 million) and Kamala Harris ($12 million), and even trailing newcomer Pete Buttigieg ($7 million). Booker's campaign has attempted to downplay that gap: ""The raw numbers of money is irrelevant,"" Demissie said Thursday. ""It has to be connected to a strategy."" 'Mayor Pete' surges into the top 10 in our 2020 rankings That strategy has been to build slowly, putting the pieces in place now, particularly on the ground in early primary states, to make the most of a breakthrough moment later on. But Demissie acknowledges the need ""to stay relevant in the conversation"" in the meantime, amidst a competitive and increasingly crowded Democratic field — and so the campaign is beginning to ramp up its public exposure, beginning with the rally Saturday in Newark. ""Now, it's phase two,"" said Robert Wolf, an influential Democratic donor, who gave money to Booker and four other candidates in the first quarter: Harris, Buttigieg, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke. At this juncture, Booker ""needs to continue to creep up in the polls and really solidify himself in the top half dozen"" candidates, Wolf added — and Booker's rally in Newark could mark a major moment in that effort. ""Everyone has one day to launch,"" said Wolf, ""so it's an important day for him."" As with Harris' kickoff rally in Oakland and O'Rourke's in El Paso, Booker's event will be set in a place central to his biography: Newark, where Booker won a city council seat as a 29-year-old political upstart, beating a longtime incumbent, and then went on to challenge longtime incumbent Mayor Sharpe James. In a Democratic field that could balloon into the twenties, Booker points to his political and governance education in Newark as his special sauce. In his narrow loss to James in 2002, Booker learned the art of political combat. And, after he came back to win the mayorship in 2006, he worked to transform the city as its chief executive. On Saturday, Booker himself is not expected to focus on that piece of his biography. But his event, and a roster of other speakers, will help him do the talking. The kickoff rally will take place in downtown Military Park, a public space that underwent a dramatic makeover under Booker, nearby a Whole Foods that Booker helped bring to the city. On hand to introduce Booker will be his successor as mayor, Ras Baraka, as well as Sen. Bob Menendez and Gov. Phil Murphy, among others. Booker's story has so far been eclipsed by those of other ascendant candidates , however — including another mayor, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend. Buttigieg benefits from a certain degree of novelty relative to Booker, who was in his own Wunderkind Mayor phase more than a decade ago. Incidentally, Buttigieg will hold his own rally this weekend in South Bend, to officially announce his campaign for president after an exploratory phase. But Booker will be launching a new phase of sorts as well, beginning to hone his campaign narrative and home in on a central theme of justice. Here's why you can't discount Joe Biden's early polling lead Booker's organization was ""very intentional in wanting to do this at this point in the campaign"" as opposed to when Booker first jumped into the race in February, Demissie said, ""...as a moment to be able to say clearly and above the din of what's happening on a daily basis, why Cory's in the race and what he's fighting for."" The campaign will expand its reach in the coming weeks, with plans for Booker to visit Georgia, California, Wisconsin, Texas and Florida for the first time as a candidate. And they will begin hiring in Super Tuesday primary states soon, campaign officials said Thursday, now that their teams on the ground in the first four primary states are up and running. Booker is also making a turn toward a more pronounced policy focus. During a swing through New Hampshire last week, Booker tailored his stump speech to get more into the weeds of his ""baby bonds"" proposal, which would fund a savings account for every child in America until age 18, in an effort to diminish inequality. ""Not just sentiments,"" Booker told the crowd last week at Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network conference. ""I'm fighting to deliver substance."" That appearance drew rave reviews for Booker, as did his remarks this week at the North American Building Trades Unions. His team hopes to continue racking up such momentum slowly and methodically, confident that the Democratic field remains wide open. ""They don't need a breakthrough moment at this point,"" said Mo Elleithee, executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics, and a former Democratic operative. ""They need an infrastructure — so that when he does have a breakthrough moment, he can capitalize on it and sustain it."" Plus, breakthrough moments — like bolts of political lightning — can be ""fleeting,"" Elleithee added. ""It's narrative that wins. That's what he needs to focus on, is getting his narrative out there."""
Amritsar massacre: India demands full apology from Britain - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Sandi Sidhu, Sugam Pokharel",04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/india/amritsar-massacre-100-years-intl-gbr/index.html,"(CNN) Hundreds have gathered in the northern Indian city of Amritsar to mark the centenary of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre where British troops killed hundreds of men, women and children.
On April 13, 1919, British troops fired without warning on a peaceful protest of thousands of unarmed Indians in Amritsar, Punjab, in what became alternately known as the Amritsar or the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. While the number of those killed is disputed between British and Indian authorities, a report by a British-led committee following the massacre put the number of victims at close to 400, with three to four times as many people injured. Indian observers said more than 1,000 people lost their lives. Rahul Gandhi, the president of the India National Congress, the main opposition party, was joined at the site of the massacre by Punjab State Chief, Captain Amarinder Singh , to lay a floral wreath to victims. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also paid homage to those killed at Amritsar during a rally in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

— Chowkidar Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 13, 2019 Indian school students hold the national flag in honor of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, on the eve of the anniversary. UK Prime Minister Theresa May mentioned the massacre during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, describing it as ""a shameful scar on British-Indian history."" She added, ""As Her Majesty the Queen said before visiting Jallianwala Bagh in 1997, 'It is a distressing example of our past history with India. We deeply regret what happened and the suffering caused.'"" However, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, a minister in Modi's government, dismissed May's statement and demanded a full apology from the UK government. ""British Prime Minister Theresa May calling the #JallianwalaBaghMassacre a ""shameful act"" in British-Indian history is not good enough. There should be an apology in clear words,"" she tweeted.

According to Reuters, Asquith added: ""The revulsion that we felt at the time is still strong today. It tarnished the reputation and we regret, as I say, the suffering and will continue to do so."""
10 critical 'GoT' details to remember during the final season - CNN,edition.cnn.com,AJ Willingham,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/entertainment/game-of-thrones-season-8-finale-theories-details-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Nothing in ""Game of Thrones"" happens by accident.
Petyr Baelish can't just tell Sweet Robin that some men die on the privy without a toilet-bound Tywin Lannister getting two arrows to the gut a few episodes later. Maggy the Frog can't just tell a young Cersei Lannister that she'll have three royal children who will die without Cersei actually having three royal children who bite the dust in increasingly tragic ways. It means that in the final few episodes, basically every detail, line of dialogue and theory from the past seven seasons could very well be at the center of some mind-blowing revelation. However, a LOT has happened, and you'd be forgiven if somewhere between the Red Wedding and Margaery Tyrell becoming green mist, the section of your brain devoted to ""Game of Thrones"" deep cuts got a little overloaded. So, settle in to your favorite knobbly tree, let your eyes roll back in your head and let's journey through time and space to revisit 10 critical details that may or may not play a part in the final season -- but will be good to remember anyway. (NOTE: This list only includes things specifically mentioned or heavily implied in the series, so things like the Valonqar prophecy are not mentioned by name. Otherwise, we'd be here all day.) Read More 1. White Walker symbols In case you needed a clue that this story wasn't JUST about games and thrones, after all, the very first scene of Season 1, Episode 1 ends with a very cryptic arrangement of dead bodies, executed by the very murder snowmen we've come to know and fear. We see the White Walkers using circular patterns pretty often, and a spiral pattern of dead bodies in Season 3, Episode 3 is echoed again in Season 6, Episode 5 when the Children of the Forest set about making the Night King. We can assume these aren't isolated incidents -- Mance Rayder even comments that the White Walkers are ""ever the artists."" And the spirals are back in Season 7, Episode 4 when Jon shows Daenerys cave paintings of the White Walkers that feature the mysterious shapes. What does it all mean? Well, obviously we don't know yet, but here's another thought to keep you awake at night: Aside from those horrible dry ice screeches, White Walkers don't talk (as far as we know). If the Night King and Company are really going to be the epic antagonists this season, it's pretty likely we're going to learn more about their motives, which means they're going to have to communicate. How? Unless the Night King clears his throat and David Attenborough comes floating out, the answer may lie in these symbols. 2. Daenerys' vision in the House of the Undying Some ""GoT"" hints and prophesies are subtle, and some haul off and smack you right in the face years before you even know what to do with them. In Season 2, Episode 10 , Daenerys enters a symbolically rich vision while trying to escape the creepy warlocks of Qarth. In it, she explores a frozen, snowy version of the Red Keep, complete with a charred, burnt-out ceiling. Hmm. She then approaches the Iron Throne -- the one thing she thinks she wants, the one thing that has driven her entire odyssey in Essos. She gets close enough to touch it and ... doesn't. H . Let's not even get into the emotional reunion she has with Khal Drogo and her son Rhaego and focus on how likely it is that all of this very obvious imagery will come to pass. Because remember, as of now, the Red Keep is in one piece and Daenerys is torn between wanting the throne and not wanting every living person in Westeros to be turned into a skeleton puppet. Oh, and snow is definitely in the forecast for King's Landing. JUST WATCHED 'Game of Thrones' star describes 'fantastic' role Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

Then comes another, younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear."" Those are the words of Maggy the Frog, a witch young Cersei visits in Season 5, Episode 1 . Young Cersei, already very much a vicious queen-in-training, asks the woman for some predictions. And boy, does she deliver. Maggy the Frog accurately predicts baby Cersei's marriage to Robert Baratheon, his philandering ways, Cersei's three golden children and their three golden deaths. But that first tidbit hasn't yet come to pass. Sure, there was Margaery, but Cersei assured that she and almost every other Tyrell became vapor, so Daenerys is the obvious answer to the prophecy. What may be even more interesting to ponder is what, exactly, Cersei still ""holds dear."" Her children are gone, Jaime's done with her and her motivations seem less and less focused. Don't forget, though, Cersei really believes in prophecy: She notes to Jaime in Season 6 that everything Maggy said came true. No doubt she thinks about that while she's sitting on the Iron Throne in her fabulous black mourning clothes. (Another deep dive on this: Maggy the Frog also says to Cersei that her ""joy will turn to ashes in her mouth,"" which could just be a figurative and rather metal threat. However, and bear with us here, in Season 3, Episode 4 , Joffrey throws us an interesting morsel: While wooing Margaery with various dead things, Joffrey points out the skull of Aerion Targaryen, who died because he thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon. Spoiler alert: It didn't. But given Cersei's Targaryen-like penchant for wildfire, paranoia and vengeance, it's a pretty interesting detail alongside ol' Maggy's colorful words.) 4. The reason Daenerys can't have children In case you haven't heard, Daenerys can't bear children. We know this because she has told literally everyone in the ""GoT"" universe and repeated it several times to Jon, a man she knows carnally but not genealogically (yet). Her reason for believing she's a lifelong dragon mom (the fantasy equivalent of a dog mom) goes back to Season 1, Episode 10 , when the witch Mirri Maz Duur tricks her into essentially trading the life of her unborn child for the life of her ailing husband Khal Drogo. However, she finds Drogo alive but not living, ya know, and when Daenerys asks Mirri when he'll be back in fighting shape, she replies: ""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before."" Which, of course, is fancy witch speak for ""never."" But judging by how often it has been noted that Dany can never have children, it's not unreasonable to suspect ""never"" is kind of flexible in this case. So will Mirri's words come echoing back in some poetic, heretofore unknown way? Mirri also tells Dany, ""Only death can pay for life."" Since that could describe about a dozen different ""Game of Thrones"" scenarios past and present, it's worth keeping in your bank of general ""GoT"" wisdom. 5. Weirwood trees Hey, remember those? The spooky red and white trees that used to grow across Westeros and hold deep religious significance, especially for people in the north? The ones that sometimes bear carved faces and weep sap and seem to always pop up when something mythologically important happens? Some quick reminders: Weirwood trees seem to have some sort of magical connection to ancient races, specifically the Children of the Forest. Greenseers who possess warging abilities and the ability to see the past and the future, can use weirwood trees to essentially look through, like time periscopes. There is a heart tree (a special weirwood with a carved face) still at Winterfell, and under its branches, a ridiculous amount of important stuff has happened, most recently several reunions of the Stark children and the tragic, ill-fated marriage of Sansa and Ramsay Bolton. Given that there is a lot of mythological explaining to be done and Winterfell will undoubtedly be the site of lots and lots of action and revelation, those trees might come back into play. Oh, and you know where else a weirwood tree made an appearance? In Season 6, Episode 5 , when the Children of the Forest make the Night King, they tie him to -- you got it -- a weirwood tree. 6. Bran's weirwood visions Speaking of trees, perhaps one of the most enticing puzzles in the whole story is Bran's garbled, alarming weirwood vision. In Season 4, Episode 2 , Bran touches a weirwood north of the wall and immediately goes into sensory overdrive: He sees the same snowy throne room Daenerys saw in Season 2 and the shadow of dragons flying over King's Landing. But what's really interesting about this vision is the stuff he sees from the past: He sees his father, Ned, cleaning his sword underneath the heart tree in Winterfell. He sees Ned's panicked face in the dungeons of King's Landing before his execution. He also sees the creepy wight girl that was part of the opening sequence of the pilot episode. Not to mention, he gets glimpses of the Land of Always Winter, the north-iest northern part of Westeros, where the Night King and his undead men reign. Are these different snippets supposed to form some pointillistic picture of truth that we have to take 10 steps back from to truly understand? Or are they just random, intriguing elements sewn together to make people wonder? 7. Melisandre's whole deal Look, Melisandre's made some mistakes. Stannis was a non-starter, Jon just wanted to be friends and burning a little girl was probably one of the worst things to ever happen in Westeros (and that's saying something). But if ""Game of Thrones"" has taught us anything, it's that we should definitely believe witches. Here are some big things to remember about the Red Priestess: In Season 3, Episode 6 , she accurately predicts Arya's future as an assassin/freelance murderer. She also says they ""will meet again."" That honestly cannot come soon enough. She left Westeros for Volantis last season, but not before telling Varys in Season 7, Episode 3 that she'd be back: ""I have to die in this strange country, just like you."" Now, she doesn't specify when this dying will happen, but let's assume it's not of old age on a golf course in Dorne. She definitely has some sort of visionary power past the whole flame thing. In Season 5, Episode 4 , after unsuccessfully trying to seduce Jon, she pulls out his dead lover Ygritte's secret line: ""You know nothing, Jon Snow."" How did she know? There are more of her. Remember Kinvara, the Red Priestess who earned the title of only person to ever really freak Varys out? In Season 6, Episode 1 , the beautiful Red Priestess comes to Meereen to side with Daenerys and drag out Varys' tragic past. Will we see her again? Since Melisandre is so confident in Jon and Dany, will she bring her Red Priestess friends to help fulfill the age of the Lord of Light? Only the flames know. Oh right, and she's ancient! In Season 6, Episode 1 , Melisandre takes off her necklace to reveal she's actually about 6,578 years old. We really need more details here.

Behind the music of 'Game of Thrones' 01:26 8. 'There must always be a Stark in Winterfell' The Starks have the esoteric, foreboding catchphrase game down: ""Winter is coming,"" ""The North remembers,"" and in Season 1, Episode 2 , Catelyn Stark relates another critical chestnut to her son Robb: ""There must always be a Stark in Winterfell."" This line has plagued show watchers and book readers for years, and since Winterfell is going to be a deeply important setting this year, it seems as good a time as any to get some answers. Remember, Starks are tied to the First Men, one of the three ancient ethnic groups to populate Westeros. They have a special connection to the land, the Wall (a Stark was said to have constructed it), the Night's Watch (a Stark was the first Lord Commander) and supposedly to the areas north of the wall. If the northern ground is really as heavy with magic and myth as they've made it seem, this line feels more like a prophesy than a boast. Could it come into play when war descends on Winterfell? 9. Sansa and Tyrion's marriage So much traumatic stuff has happened to Sansa in the past few seasons, it's almost quaint to think that her marriage to Tyrion in Season 3, Episode 8 was as bad as it was going to get. Tyrion and Sansa were forced to marry by Tywin Lannister, and not long after their nuptials, Joffrey dies at his own wedding and Sansa is spirited away in the melee. It's obvious their paths will cross soon, since Tyrion is Dany's Hand and Sansa is Lady of Winterfell. And given that Tyrion has pretty bad romantic abandonment issues and things for Sansa are just now starting to not be a total hell, there's probably no love lost there. Also, there will probably be tensions when Sansa finds out Jon has unilaterally aligned himself with a Targaryen and that Targaryen is championed by a Lannister. So, you know, awkwardness is coming. READ MORE: What ""Game of Thrones"" can tell us about trauma 10. White Walker babies Let's end where we began: We know the White Walkers are going to be important this season. We know that most of the big mysteries in the series surround their motives and their makeup. So, it's really important to remember that the way they come into this world is completely bizarre and mythologically unclear. In Season 4, Episode 4 , one of Craster's sons (Craster is an abusive, incestuous wildling who made a pact to give up his sons to the White Walkers) is picked up by the Night King's men and taken to the mysterious, icy world of the Land of Always Winter, where he is given an extreme baby makeover and turned into an itty-bitty White Walker. This all happens with a single forehead touch from the Night King, and luckily it all looks pretty painless. But that sequence, combined with the Children of the Forest's original Night King experiment (which involved a giant dragon glass dagger), doesn't really give us a clear picture of who these dudes are, why they exist or even how they exist. We need more information to make it clear. Heck, we need more of everything."
US military mission in Somalia could take seven years to complete,edition.cnn.com,Ryan Browne,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/us-military-somalia-mission/index.html,"(CNN) This week President Donald Trump signed an executive order extending a presidential declaration of a national emergency concerning Somalia for another year, calling the Islamist insurgency plaguing that country an ""unusual and extraordinary threat"" to the US.
But even if that is the last extension of the declaration, US defense officials say the mission in the country is likely to take years to complete. The fight there hinges on US Special Operations Forces being able to train an elite Somali army unit capable of defeating al Qaeda-linked militants on the ground. The commitment to the East African nation comes after the President has signaled a desire to reduce US troop levels across the globe and as the administration is in the process of withdrawing forces from Syria. While officials say the effort is making progress, they tell CNN that the US training mission is likely to not be completed until 2026. For nearly two years, a small team of US Special Operations forces has been embedded with the Somali National Army, assisting in the fight against the militant group Al-Shabaab. As well as advising on airstrikes and ground assaults, the Navy SEAL-led team's primary task is to train and build Somalia its own elite light infantry force. Read More Named Danab, which in Somali means lightning, the force currently numbers only about 500 soldiers, too few to carry out operations in a country with a coastline almost as long as the east coast of the US. The plan, US defense officials say, is to eventually build Danab into a force of 3,000 soldiers capable of clearing militants from villages and towns across Somalia. U.S. Army 101st Airborne Division soldiers deployed with U.S. Army Forces Africa stand with Somali National Army soldiers during a graduation ceremony May 24, 2017, in Mogadishu, Somalia. ""The plan is to build two companies a year, with the end-state being five battalions and a brigade headquarters element,"" Becky Farmer, a spokesperson for Africa Command which oversees US military operations on the continent, told CNN in a statement. ""We think it's going to take approximately seven years for the Somalis to absorb all of these forces,"" a defense official familiar with the US counterterrorism strategy in Somalia told CNN. ""If everything works out and however many miracles line up to make this happen it could go faster, and it could go slower,"" he added. A quarter century after the events surrounding ""Black Hawk Down,"" the incident that killed 18 US soldiers in Mogadishu, the US military finds itself more actively engaged in Somalia than at any time since. Though the US has higher troop levels in Niger and Djibouti, Somalia is the only place in Africa where the US military is regularly carrying out airstrikes against enemy forces. The Pentagon has about 500 to 600 personnel in Somalia according to US Africa Command. While US military advisers have been in Somalia since at least 2013, the effort has gotten a major boost under the Trump Administration, which volunteered to undertake the Danab advisory mission in 2017 in addition to expanding drone strikes, and in December reopened the American diplomatic mission in Mogadishu for the first time since 1991. Trump authorized the military to carry out precision strikes targeting Al-Shabaab in March 2017. Prior to that the US military was authorized to conduct airstrikes only in defense of advisers on the ground. So far this year, at least 255 fighters from Al-Shabaab have been killed in 30 airstrikes, according to figures released by US Africa Command. In 2018 the US conducted 47 airstrikes targeting Al-Shabaab, killing about 337 militants. In 2017 the US carried out 35 airstrikes and in 2016 it conducted just 15. ""The bottom line is we're taking formations and fighters and leaders off the battlefield. And that is having effect on the network,"" Brig. Gen. William West, the deputy director of operations for Africa Command, told CNN in a statement. The increase in airstrikes though has been criticized by some members of Congress and outside groups like Amnesty International, which has accused the US of killing civilians in Somalia. While the US military has rejected Amnesty's allegations, US Africa Command announced earlier this month that it had determined that one of its 2018 drone strikes had killed two civilians, the first ever such acknowledgment by the US military in Somalia. US military officials stress that the airstrikes are only one component of the US military's overall campaign in Somalia. ""Every strike we take, whether it's on the pace that we're on this year or on the pace that we've been on in previous years, is all done in support of the strategy. And the strategy supports the goals of security and stability in Somalia,"" Maj. Gen. Gregg Olson, the director of operations for US Africa Command said in a statement to CNN. The administration regards the fight against the militant group Al-Shabaab in Somalia as critical to protecting America's primary strategic allies in the region such as Kenya and Ethiopia which have been hit by Al Shabaab-linked terror attacks in the recent years. London Meeting The current strategy is partly a result of a May 2017 conference held in London, where a group of countries including the UK, US, Kenya and Ethiopia along with representatives from the UN, African Union and European Union, met to discuss the future of Somalia. For years the task of fighting Al-Shabaab in Somalia had fallen to the African Union-led peacekeeping mission, AMISOM. But in the months leading up to the London Conference, Al-Shabaab proved that it was still a potent force on the battlefield with its fighters overrunning three AMISOM bases, seizing weaponry, armored vehicles and ammunition. In London, a plan was agreed on that called for the creation of a regular army of 18,000 troops and 32,000 federal and state police to eventually replace the African Union-led peacekeeping mission, AMISOM which had spent years fighting Al-Shabaab. Then-Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis agreed that the US would take responsibility for ""training specific numbers of proficient and mobile light infantry capable of defeating Al-Shabaab,"" referring to the Danab unit. The rest of Somalia's security forces were to be trained by international advisers from the EU, Turkey and the UAE on a bilateral basis. Coordinating that effort has been a challenge, US officials say, and has led to some less than stellar results. A State Department official told CNN that while there have been some successes in integrating Somali troops trained by Turkish and UAE advisers into the national army, many of the 6,000 Somali troops trained by the EU did not join the national army and ""most of them have gone off to militias and local clans."" ""It is a work in progress,"" he added. The US military does attempt to coordinate these various efforts while also providing support to AMISOM troops via a military coordination cell that is led by a one star general in Mogadishu. Despite those previous misfires, US officials are confident that the focus of the US-effort, Danab, will stay loyal to the central government. ""Ultimately, the Danab as a unit fall under the central Somali government and we have no indications of dual loyalty,"" Farmer, the spokesperson for Africa, told CNN. US military officials say that in the past Al-Shabaab has exploited local grievances among the many clans that make-up Somalia as a means of gaining power so the US has made a concerted effort to ensure that the forces comprising Danab are representative of the areas where they operate helping to gain the trust of the locals, something that could be contributing to the slow pace of increasing its size. ""The Danab are clan-appropriate and integrated units of the Somali National Army, with one battalion aligned to each Federal Member State, in order to provide locally acceptable and trusted forces of the Somali National Army,"" Farmer said. ""The indications we've received on the ground are that the Somali people hold the Danab in the highest esteem as a result of these efforts,"" Farmer added. Signs of Progress American diplomats, military officers, and USAID officials all told CNN that they see progress in Somalia, with many citing increased security in major cities and towns and government reform efforts. Trump's extension of the emergency declaration came the same day Somalia's Prime Minister Hassan Khayre visited the White House for a meeting with Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton. Khayre, who has been praised by American diplomats and USAID officials for his efforts to reform Somalia's economy and security forces, also visited the Pentagon Thursday. One major success is the town of Kismayo, which was recaptured in 2012 after it was once considered an Al-Shabaab stronghold. US officials say that the Somali security forces have managed to expand the security bubble around Kismayo out some 25 miles from the town. USAID officials told CNN that at least 1,000 families have returned to Kismayo. Still, the focus remains on securing the areas around the capital Mogadishu where Al-Shabaab, despite having been driven from the city, can still carry out terror attacks. An attack last month killed dozens. The hope is that eventually the elite Somali troops will be able to drive Al-Shabaab from strategic corridors and areas near the capital, and keep them from attacking Mogadishu. For now though, the Somalis are still heavily reliant on US forces, particularly for functions like planning and intelligence. ""We're still involved in every single operation,"" a defense official told CNN. Though American advisers still accompany Somali troops out in the field, officials say they've taken steps to mitigate risks to US personnel. ""We always work to stay no closer than the last line of cover or concealment and we only go outside the wire when we do not think contact is expected or likely,"" a US defense official familiar with US intelligence in Somalia told CNN. It can still be a dangerous mission. Last month the US called in an airstrike in Somalia's Lower Shabelle Region after a Somali-led force that was being advised by US personnel came under attack. The last US soldier that was killed in Somalia was in June 2018, US Army Sgt. Alexander Conrad was killed and three other soldiers were wounded by ""indirect fire"" after they came under attack while helping local forces set up the kind of combat outpost the US military sees as critical to its strategy in Somalia. The US military estimates that Al-Shabaab commands somewhere between 5,000 to 7,000 fighters and still controls about 20% of Somalia's territory. It's a far cry from Al-Shabaab's heyday when it controlled most of the country including the towns of Kismayo and Baraawe and even some parts of the capital, Mogadishu. ""Folks in the United States, they think Blackhawk Down and things like that,"" a USAID official told CNN, saying that the country has made major improvements in recent years, thanks largely to the improved relationship between the US and Somali governments since the December re-establishment of the US diplomatic mission in Mogadishu, the first such presence since 1991. After the fighting A big part of making sure the military gains against Al-Shabaab are sustained is ensuring that forces are able to hold the recaptured territory. Doing that requires a healthy dose of humanitarian aid. But the US development aid budget to Somalia is limited, at only about $60 million according to USAID officials. ""We have a lean operation,"" one USAID official said. Things could get even leaner as the Trump administration's 2020 State Department budget request is seeking only $58 million in ""Economic Support and Development Funds for Somalia, a decrease of some $15 million from the previous year. The US does also provide hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to meet more short term emergency requirements like famine relief. And even if Al-Shabaab is defeated, officials say other security challenges remain. ""It's not just Al-Shabaab, There are clan grievances here that go back hundreds of years, that has to be sorted out too,"" one USAID official said."
Trump's tax returns: House committee sends new letter to IRS demanding six years of records - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Lauren Fox,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/trump-tax-returns-house-letter-irs/index.html,"(CNN) House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal is not backing down on his request for six years of the President Donald Trump's personal and business tax returns, he writes In a new letter sent Saturday to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig.
In a two-page letter, Neal writes that he believes his committee is well within its rights to see the President's tax returns and that he expects a decision from the IRS within the next 10 days. ""I expect a reply from the IRS by 5:00 p.m. on April 23, 2019. Please know that if you fail to comply, your failure will be interpreted as a denial of my request,"" Neal writes. The letter leans heavily into the committee's legal rational for the returns and Neal writes that, ""I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding my request, and the authority of the committee. Those concerns lack merit. Moreover, judicial precedent commands that none of the concerns raised can legitimately be used to deny the committee's request."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Saturday said he has ""not personally spoken"" to Attorney General William Barr about a congressional request made by Neal for Trump's tax returns. Read More When asked by CNN, the secretary told reporters that the Treasury's Department's legal office has been in consultation with the Justice Department's lawyers. ""Those conversation have started, but it would be premature for me to conclude how long that will take, because as I've said these are complicated issues,"" said Mnuchin, who was speaking on the sidelines of the annual International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington. ""And I think it's more important to the American taxpayers that we get this right than we hit an arbitrary deadline."" When asked by CNN whether he would be able reconcile concerns around the constitutionality of the request by Neal's new deadline of April 23, he said, ""I'm not going to make a commitment prematurely as to whether we will be able to conclude our legal review within that deadline or not. Obviously, given the importance of this issue we have people working on this diligently. But again I would just emphasize this is a decision that has enormous precedence in potentially weaponizing the IRS. ""The chairman gave us a deadline last time. Again, we responded by that deadline,"" said Mnuchin, who first saw Neal's letter earlier on Saturday on Twitter. ""The Chairman is giving us a new deadline. I'm sure we'll respond by that deadline."" READ: Neal's letter to the IRS The letter comes just days after the Treasury Department told Neal that it would not meet a one-week deadline to turn over the President's tax information and that it would instead consult with the Justice Department before responding further. Highlighting what he called the ""unprecedented nature of this request,"" Mnuchin wrote to Neal this week that he -- not the IRS commissioner -- would manage the Treasury's handling of the request and that the Justice Department was being consulted ""to ensure that our response is fully consistent with the law and Constitution."" ""The Committee's request raises serious issues concerning the constitutional scope of Congressional investigative authority, the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose, and the constitutional rights of American citizens,"" Mnuchin wrote. ""The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically-motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power."" The standoff between Congress and the administration over the request is expected to launch an unprecedented legal battle, one that will test for the first time in court a 1920s-era tax statute that was little known until recently. Democrats believe they have the power under IRS code 6103 to request Trump's tax information including, but not limited to his tax returns. The law states that three people: the House Ways and Means chairman, the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Chairman of Senate Finance can ask for anyone's personal tax information for their committee's use. Neal has argued that the committee needs Trump's tax information in order to conduct oversight of the Presidential audit program, a program that is not enshrined in law, but instead has become a routine procedure at the IRS that when a new President comes into office. The back-and-forth is just the beginning of a fight that has long been anticipated to weave its way through the courts. Democrats argue that 6103 requests are made all the time and are routinely handled through the IRS, not under the supervision of the treasury secretary. Republicans have dismissed Neal's request as unprecedented and political. Mnuchin himself has argued that requesting the President's personal tax returns now rises to a level that he needs to be involved."

Serrano says the exhibition is a portrait of US President Donald Trump that features more than 1,000 objects he purchased mostly from eBay, at a cost of nearly $200,000. A 10-foot high, rotating ""Ego"" sign in bold letters from Taj Mahal's Ego Lounge sits in the center of the first floor of a former nightclub in Manhattan's Meatpacking District where the exhibit is on display. One Serrano work is featured along with more than 1,000 objects he purchased.

A large print of the portrait is the only one of Serrano's own works in the show. ""I've always said that my work is very basic. It's about life, death, religion, sex, race, and everything that people think about. So what is it now that occupies everyone's thoughts? It's Donald Trump,"" Serrano said. The same ideals that many people once admired about Trump are now the same ones that many hate.

State of the art: How will Trump's taste change the White House? Now, Serrano is partnering with "" a/political ,"" an arts initiative based in London whose mission is to support artists producing socially engaged work, and he is not shying away from making art out of controversial subject matter. ""There are a lot of things that concern me about this administration,"" Serrano said. ""In a way, I can understand what happened. It seems like Donald Trump had a lot of cards in his favor, just being the antithesis to Barack Obama. I see his election as a backlash to Barack Obama's presidency.""

An autographed copy of Esquire, with a headline that reads: ""Hater-in-Chief"" might inspire a laugh but by signing these covers, Trump suggests he's bigger than the opinions of his critics and American voters. Ironically, the same ideals that many people once admired about Trump are the same ones that many now hate. Most people by now have formed their own opinions either for or against Trump, but Serrano seems uninterested in inserting himself into the debate. Credit: Andres Serrano Workbooks and a diploma from Trump University that once fueled aspiring entrepreneurs' capitalist dreams are also on display. Merchandise from his numerous other business ventures including Trump Shuttle, Trump Steaks, Trump Casinos, colognes, and a talking Trump doll from ""The Apprentice"" account for an astonishing number of products in the exhibit that feature the Trump name. It almost seems like overkill, but that may be part of Serrano's point. How White House photographers have shaped the image of the President A Monopoly-like game, ""Trump: The Game,"" carries a tagline that reads: ""It's not whether you win or lose...It's whether you win."" The display cases are loaded with material, including a letter from former Mexican President Vicente Fox. There's also a tie collection and his ""Make America Great Again"" hats. Why is art so expensive? Most people by now have formed their own opinions either for or against Trump, but Serrano seems uninterested in inserting himself into the debate. He is, however, concerned about support for arts funding and where the administration is headed. Is the exhibition a celebration of Trump or a criticism of him? That interpretation, Serrano leaves to the viewers. ""I've treated all these objects like precious objects and treated them like art,"" Serrano said.

"Don't underestimate Kim Kardashian, Esq. (opinion) - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Holly Thomas,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/opinions/kim-kardashian-turns-to-law-thomas/index.html,"Holly Thomas is a writer and editor based in London. She tweets @HolstaT . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.
(CNN) ""First year of law school,"" Kim Kardashian West told US Vogue in her May cover interview, ""you have to cover three subjects: criminal law, torts, and contracts."" (For the record, there are a few others, too, including constitutional law and civil procedure). For Kardashian, ""Torts is the most confusing, contracts the most boring, and crim law I can do in my sleep. Took my first test, I got a 100. Super easy for me.""
Holly Thomas Kardashian announced this week in the same interview that she began a four-year apprenticeship with a law firm in San Francisco last summer and wants to take the California bar exam in 2022. (She is not enrolled in law school. Under California law, aspiring lawyers can undertake an apprenticeship and if they pass the bar exam, they can practice law -- even without a law school degree). The reality superstar's pivot to becoming a lawyer — apparently motivated by her stated desire to do more to improve the criminal justice system, ""to fight to fix it,"" -- has prompted a mixed response. Many have predictably derided the move as idiotic, telling her to stay in her lane. Others have called the criticism sexist, highlighting the obvious comparison between Kardashian and Reese Witherspoon's character in the 2001 movie ""Legally Blonde,"" Elle Woods -- also initially dismissed in her law school efforts because of her looks and past persona. The bottom line is this: Kardashian is inspiring for choosing a new path as a 38-year-old mother of three — and she is also the nauseatingly privileged proof that in today's America, no option is off-limits for the very wealthy. In many ways, this is the most interesting thing Kim Kardashian West has ever done. And it says a lot about the susceptibility of the public and press to her carefully-constructed image that so few saw this coming. Read More Why Kim Kardashian wanted President Trump to free me There are some obvious ways in which this path makes sense for Kardashian. Her father, Robert Kardashian, was a well-known lawyer, part of OJ Simpson's defense team. She has already demonstrated an interest in the law, making herself heard on criminal justice issues and playing a significant part last year in President Trump's release of Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old woman who'd been in an Alabama prison on a nonviolent drug charge since 1996. Meeting with Trump, alongside CNN commentator and activist Van Jones, plus several lawyers, Kardashian West helped persuade the President with a force of argument Jones described as ""the most effective, emotionally intelligent intervention that I've ever seen in American politics."" She has also worked for months with #cut50, a bipartisan advocacy group aiming to reform the criminal-justice system. Compared with some of her other ventures -- advertising dangerous slimming teas to her legions of young female fans, for example -- this looks not just like a step in a far more positive direction, but a break from the brand the Kardashian family has built over the years. The Kardashians are described in public discourse variously as mercenary, feminist, impressive, groundbreaking, and sickeningly superficial. There are strong arguments to be made for every case, but despite so many opposing characteristics, they tend to be referred to as a monolith -- not individuals so much as component parts of a vast, unprecedented money machine. Britney Spears is taking care of herself. Too many others can't Kim Kardashian, for years the most famous member of her family, was somehow the most Kardashian. She was the most polished, the most bankable (until sister Kylie Jenner's ascent), almost inhumanly adapted to the constant whirl of 5 a.m. workouts, three-hour makeup sessions, photo shoots and paparazzi that the machine demanded. She leaned in to the living doll persona, which the media so eagerly bestowed upon her, and as a result, many now have difficulty imagining her as anything but that. Throughout 16 seasons of the reality show that made her family world-famous, Kim's demeanor has scarcely changed. A couple of upsetting instances aside, she has remained placid throughout, more prone to asking questions than volunteering confidences herself. When emotions ran high as Caitlin Jenner went public with her transition, Kim was often the mediator, allowing everyone their say, but intervening to defuse tense conversations when necessary. In a way, it is her predictability that makes Kim Kardashian such comforting television. With her, you always know what you're getting. In retrospect, some of those considered responses signpost a personality that could be mesh with a career in law. Why we're celebrating a three-month-old law When in 2017, Kardashian described the process of identifying the men who robbed her at gunpoint in her Paris hotel room in October 2016, she was matter of fact. She itemized events without adding color or emotion, even noting that the men who had attacked her were 'pretty honest' in their recall of that night. Her most revealing comment was that it was ""interesting"" to know that they had been following her for over a year. She added that she was ""thankful"" for the experience, as it had afforded her ""all the background info'""she needed on how she could protect herself in future. Her recent foray into criminal justice also isn't the first time that digging below her contoured surface has revealed unexpected depths. Following the Parkland shooting last year, she tweeted to urge Congress to do its job and ""protect Americans from senseless gun violence."" She also took to Twitter in 2015 to denounce lax gun laws, after David Conley bought a gun online to kill his ex-girlfriend, her husband, and her six children, including his own son (she tweeted, ""Does this not sicken you?""). She did so again after the 2017 Las Vegas music festival shooting to share an image denouncing high capacity firearms as inconsistent with the Second Amendment. Every time she has spoken out on gun laws, Kim has been met with derogatory remarks such as, ""Stick to selfies."" But she has backed up her tweets. In 2016, she met with gun violence survivors from Sandy Hook and San Bernardino. For several years, she's been a creative council member of the organization Everytown For Gun Safety, which is dedicated to gun safety and fighting for legislative reform. In 2017, she recognized National Gun Violence Awareness Day by speaking out against a bill signed by Trump that revoked an Obama-era regulation. She may not always broadcast it, but Kim Kardashian does her homework. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

As far as her metamorphosis from reality star into woke lawyer goes, the proof will be in the pudding. If her previous activities -- not to mention the acquisitive tendencies of her mother, Kris Jenner -- are any indication, within the next decade we will see a Kardashian law firm, capitalizing on the family name but well-stocked with qualified lawyers to ensure it goes the distance (and makes as much money as possible). For now though, as a woman whose career thus far has been fed by sex appeal and social media, Kardashian's move is a bold one, picking a direction that demands a completely different skill set, and flies in the face of expectations. When asked by Vogue what she will be remembered for, she replied aptly, ""For my many talents."""
GOP legislators slap restrictions on voter-approved Medicaid expansion - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Tami Luhby,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/medicaid-expansion-states/index.html,"(CNN) Many residents in three deep-red states rejoiced last fall when voters approved Medicaid expansion, circumventing the objections of their elected representatives.
But the victories in Utah, Idaho and Nebraska -- which would have extended coverage to tens of thousands of residents in each state under the Obamacare provision -- have proven short-lived. This week, Idaho's GOP lawmakers and governor joined their peers in Utah and Nebraska in slapping work requirements and other restrictions on access to Medicaid. Idaho legislators had considered bills with less stringent measures, but ultimately rejected those. Medicaid expansion tied to fewer heart-related deaths, study finds ""We must encourage self-sufficiency among those receiving public assistance,"" Idaho Gov. Brad Little, a Republican, wrote to the president of the state Senate upon approving the bill. The moves demonstrate the enduring resistance among Republicans to adopting programs tied to the Affordable Care Act, even when voters themselves explicitly ask for them. Read More In all three states, certain Medicaid recipients, primarily working-age, non-disabled adults without dependents, will have to work or engage in other activities at least 20 hours a week to maintain their benefits. The repercussions of not doing so vary by state. In Idaho, enrollees are kicked off the program for at least two months. Nebraska's poor lose access to so-called prime coverage, which includes dental, vision and over-the-counter medication benefits. The states also made it more difficult for those just above poverty level to access Medicaid, even though Obamacare makes eligible those earning up to 138% of the poverty line, or about $12,500 for an individual. Utah is restricting coverage to those in poverty. In Nebraska, residents just over poverty must opt into Medicaid -- otherwise, they default into polices on the Obamacare exchanges, which are much pricier. Trump administration allows Utah to curtail voter-approved Medicaid expansion The states must still receive approval from the federal government, which recently lost a second court battle over work requirements in Kentucky and Arkansas. The Trump administration is appealing that decision. Advocates in all three states decried lawmakers' moves, saying they are ignoring the will of the people. Tens of thousands fewer people will gain coverage because of the restrictions. Also, work requirements will cost the states millions to administer. Judge strikes down Medicaid work requirements, again Recording the number of hours worked can be complicated, say opponents of work requirements. Some 18,000 people in Arkansas lost coverage last year, in part because they had a tough time with the online documentation system. Opponents are also skeptical that work mandates will help Medicaid enrollees become more independent. ""There's a reason why they aren't working,"" said state Rep. Ilana Rubel, an Idaho Democrat and House assistant minority leader. ""Layering on more punishment is very unlikely to produce the desired results."""
What's behind the surging interest in Pete Buttigieg (Opinion),edition.cnn.com,Julian Zelizer,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/opinions/buttigieg-contrast-trump-opinion-zelizer/index.html,"Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author, with Kevin Kruse, of the new book "" Fault Lines: A History of the United States Since 1974. "" Follow him on Twitter at @julianzelizer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
(CNN) It looks like Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- a married, gay millennial whom few voters had heard of until a few months ago -- now has a real shot at the Democratic nomination. Who would have thought that the mayor of South Bend, the fourth largest city in Indiana, could compete in one of the most crowded primary fields ever? Buttigieg, who is expected to formally launch his campaign Sunday, has emerged as a formidable candidate.
Julian Zelizer In retrospect, his unexpected viability makes a lot of sense. Democrats will select their candidate at a very special moment in American history. The outrage over President Donald Trump -- what he stands for and what he is doing with the office -- is immense. Fury over the way he has used his political power and the support he has maintained from a large swath of the American constituency has energized and mobilized Democrats unlike anything in recent history. Democratic Party voters are desperate to believe in the promise of American politics once again. Many live with the sense of disenchantment in the political system as a result of Trump's election. He is the antithesis of the feeling they had on election night 2008, when it appeared that the nation was moving in the right direction on certain basic questions about the character of the country. Buttigieg is appealing to many Democrats because he represents a shift back toward this pre-Trump American character. The mayor is intelligent and thoughtful in contrast to the bombast and bluster coming out of the White House. He seems to believe in rational problem-solving and deliberation, not ongoing Twitter rants and attacks. He comes from a new generation and the very fact that his candidacy is real represents huge steps forward that the nation has taken on basic social issues. He also remains something of a mystery, which allows different parts of the Democratic electorate to see things in him that they like. Then there's his Episcopalian faith, which leans to the left rather than being a cynical conservative tool for achieving power. Buttigieg is a symbol for a rising Christian left While many of the Democratic candidates have qualities that appeal to Democrats, moderates, even some Republicans, Buttigieg seems to have the well-rounded appeal and the right persona to garner the support that has taken others much longer to build. He has the potential to appeal to moderates even as he has taken some specific leftward positions on issues, like eliminating the Electoral College, expanding the size of the Supreme Court , and moving toward a single-payer health care system . Read More Former President Barack Obama's adviser David Axelrod likes to say that voters are often looking for someone who is the opposite of the incumbent. In trying to make sense of the 2016 election, Axelrod wrote in The New York Times that Trump fulfilled the theory of politics he believed in back in 2008: ""Open-seat presidential elections are shaped by perceptions of the style and personality of the outgoing incumbent. Voters rarely seek the replica of what they have. They almost always seek the remedy, the candidate who has the personal qualities the public finds lacking the departing executive."" Although this is not an open-seat election, Buttigieg (among other Democrats) does fulfill this model. The mayor's supporters can look to the fact that there have been a number of instances in recent history in which the candidate with the least name recognition and experience has won the nomination -- and the presidency. Certainly, Democrats can think back to Jimmy Carter in 1976, a nationally unknown governor from Georgia who competed against a field of Democrats with immense experience. ""Jimmy Who Is Running for What!?"" read the headline of the Atlanta Constitution during Carter's candidacy. Pence says Buttigieg bringing 'attacks on my Christian faith' Understanding better than anyone why voters yearned for a candidate whom they could trust and someone who did not seem deeply enmeshed in Washington politics, he won the nomination and he won the presidency. In fact, he titled one of his campaign films "" Jimmy Who? "" just to prove a point. Carter also had a keen feel for the dynamics of the post-1960s news media and nomination process, which helped him figured out how to catapult victories in small contests like Iowa into broad support. Obama had a similar experience in 2008. The senator, without a lengthy record in elected office, took on a political giant, Hillary Clinton. Added to this was the open question of whether the country would vote for an African-American president, which was not clear given our country's long history with racism. In the end, voters gravitated toward Obama, eager for a figure who they could believe in -- one who promised to move the nation beyond the broken, polarized, divisive and dysfunctional world they read about in the news every day. The clarity he showed in his opposition to the Iraq War in 2002 offered a stark contrast to Clinton's middle-of-the-road stand. With the bleak atmosphere created by the ongoing war in Iraq, as well as total collapse of the financial system in the fall of 2008, Obama was a refreshing political figure. And so he won the presidency. Pete Buttigieg's unlikely rise as a symbol of LGBT progress Some would say Trump's nomination and victory also reflects how unpredictable our presidential elections have become and how a candidate who resonates with certain portions of the party can win the nomination despite conventional wisdom. Though there are debates about the sources of the sentiment behind his success, there is agreement that a particular brew of economic and identity anxiety led Republican voters to flock toward him over much more established candidates, like Jeb Bush, providing enough support for Trump to win the Electoral College. We are far from a place where we have a clear picture of what Buttigieg's future holds. This could be a rise-and-fall candidacy that fizzles by the time we are into the summer. We have seen many of those in recent years as well. And Buttigieg still has many questions to answer about the substance of his ideas, his capacity to handle this job given his minimal experience, and whether he has the tenacity to withstand the blistering attacks that will soon be coming his way. He will also face some very strong candidates who are smart, savvy. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

But it would be a mistake to quickly discount the possibility that his campaign can be a formidable one. Not only have we seen similar stories, but we are living in one of those unique moments in which many Americans feel a sense of disillusionment, crisis and fear, like 1976 and 2008. They are desperate to believe things can be different and desperate to believe in the character of politicians. Yes, they want a tough partisan fighter who won't blow the campaign, but they also want that fighter to be someone who inspires them and makes sure that people come out to vote. That feeling is what gives the mayor from South Bend his opening to at least make a serious play for the nomination."

The girl, identified as Millie Drew Kelly on a GoFundMe site set up for the family , was shot Monday evening at their subdivision about a 40-minute drive northwest of downtown Atlanta, the Paulding County Sheriff's Office said. The siblings were in a car in their driveway, preparing to go to the boy's baseball game, when the vehicle failed to start. The mother exited to try to find out what was wrong with the car, authorities said. The boy took a gun from the car's console and accidentally fired it while his mother was outside, striking his sister in the head, the sheriff's office said. Emergency responders were called and took her to an Atlanta-area hospital. Two days later, detectives learned the girl had died, the sheriff's office said.

Mall of America: Man accused of throwing a child from the 3rd floor had been banned from the site - CNN,us.cnn.com,Madeline Holcombe,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/mall-of-america-child-thrown-anger-issues/index.html,"(CNN) The man arrested for allegedly pushing or throwing a boy from the third floor of the Mall of America in Minnesota had been banned from the mall in the past and once told police he had anger issues, court records show.
Witnesses said Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda, 24, either pushed or threw the 5-year-old boy on Friday morning from the third level of the Bloomington mall's interior to the first-level floor nearly 40 feet below, police said. Aranda, whom police said took off running after the incident, was found inside the mall's transit station and arrested. Authorities described the boy's injuries as life-threatening and said witnesses gave him first aid. Police Chief Jeff Potts said he couldn't reveal details about the child's condition Saturday afternoon. ""The child is still alive, he's still receiving care, and I think we're just asking for thoughts and prayers for that child to recover,"" Potts told reporters outside his police department Saturday. Read More At this point, police do not believe there is a relationship between the family of the child and the suspect, Potts said. Investigators are trying to figure out the motive, he said. ""(Through) our investigative work and witnesses that we've spoken to, we feel confident saying that the suspect threw the child off of the third floor. But as to why he did that, is still something we're looking into and trying to figure out."" Aranda is being held on suspicion of attempted homicide, and police expect to submit the case to prosecutors in support of charges by noon Monday, Potts said. Suspect has a history with the mall Aranda lives in the Bloomington area and has had a series of arrests and convictions related to the mall. He had been banned from Mall of America in the past and was convicted of misdemeanors in two incidents there in 2015, court records show. Aranda was charged in July 2015 with causing damage inside stores after he threw items off the upper level of the mall to the lower level, court records obtained by CNN affiliate WCCO show. Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda, 24, was charged with attempted homicide. He was accused three months later of throwing glasses of ice water and tea at a woman in a restaurant at the mall after she refused to buy him food, the records show. In that incident, he got into a physical scuffle with the manager of the restaurant, sending panicked diners fleeing, according to court records that also note Aranda at that point had been banned from Mall of America property through early July 2016. In August 2015, witnesses saw Aranda smashing computers on the floor of a Minneapolis library, causing about $5,000 in damage, according to a 2015 complaint. Police were called and arrested him without incident after finding him at a bus stop across the street. Aranda in that case told authorities he got ""angry after he read something on the Facebook"" and so smashed five computers, screens and keyboards, court records show, citing a recorded statement. ""He said he has some anger issues and told the officer that it does not happen all the time,"" the complaint states. Child's mother was screaming A witness Friday at the mall told WCCO that the child's mother was screaming that someone had thrown her child from the balcony. ""She was screaming, 'Everyone pray, everyone pray. Oh, my God, my baby, someone threw him over the edge,'"" Brian Johnson told WCCO. Mall of America officials said any more information about the incident will come from police."
Democrats aren't looking for policy: Poll of the week - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Harry Enten,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/elizabeth-warren-poll-of-the-week/index.html,"(CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is from the television show The Price Is Right .
Poll of the week: A new Quinnipiac University poll of California Democratic and Democratic leaning independents finds that former Vice President Joe Biden leads a potential primary with 26%, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders at 18%, Sen. Kamala Harris at 17% and Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 7% each. Among those same voters, 23% think Bernie Sanders has the best policy ideas, while 13% think Biden and Warren have the best policy ideas. What's the point: Sanders (with his ""Medicare for All"" push ) and Warren with her numerous policy papers are putting policy at the forefront of their campaigns. Yet they both continue to trail Biden, despite near universal name recognition . Warren even trails behind Biden and Sanders in her own state. The problem for Warren and Sanders is that voters don't seem to be voting on policy. If they were, Warren and Sanders would probably be in a better position, and Biden would probably be in a worse position, as the Quinnipiac poll indicates. Read More Voters instead are prizing other qualities, such as leadership. The Quinnipiac poll shows that by a 51% to 38% margin, Democrats and Democratic leaning independents prefer someone they think would be a ""great leader"" than someone who has ""great policy ideas"". It's hard to quantify what would make a candidate a great leader, but voters still are making their judgments. When asked who they thought would make the ""best leader,"" Biden leads in the California poll with 31%. He was followed by Sanders at 18%, Harris at 13% and Warren at 7%. In other words, the topline numbers for preferences in the primary look more like who voters think would make the best leader than who they prefer on policy. Another quality voters are looking to this year is electability. Exactly how much they are looking for it depends on the question wording, though Democratic voters are clearly prizing it a lot more than in years past. There may be a case to be made against Warren's electability , but this is another variable that's hard to quantify. Still, voters are making their own call of who they see as electable. An Iowa poll out this week from Monmouth University gets at the heart of the issue pretty clearly. Likely Democratic caucusgoers were asked whether they prefer a candidate who aligned with them on the issues but could have a tough time beating President Donald Trump or a candidate who didn't agree with them on most issues but had a better shot at beating Trump. By a 64% to 24% margin, they wanted the candidate who had a better chance of beating Trump. Electability plays right into Biden's hands. Among likely caucusgoers, he leads Sanders 27% to 16% overall. Warren is well back in fourth at 7%. Biden's lead is because of voters who prize electability over issue alignment. Among those voters, he is up 33% to 13% over Sanders. Now look at the horserace: Among those who favor issue agreement over electability, Biden falls back to 15%. He actually trails Sanders, who leads with 19%. The lesson here is pretty clear: The way to beat Biden in the Democratic primary season isn't to show he is out-of-step with the electorate on issues. If that were the way forward, Biden would probably already be losing. Rather, the way you beat Biden if you're a Democratic candidate for president is by, among other things, proving that he isn't a good leader and can't beat Trump. If other Democratic candidates are unable to do this, then Biden will likely be the Democratic nominee."
US military mission in Somalia could take seven years to complete - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Ryan Browne,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/us-military-somalia-mission/index.html,"(CNN) This week President Donald Trump signed an executive order extending a presidential declaration of a national emergency concerning Somalia for another year, calling the Islamist insurgency plaguing that country an ""unusual and extraordinary threat"" to the US.
But even if that is the last extension of the declaration, US defense officials say the mission in the country is likely to take years to complete. The fight there hinges on US Special Operations Forces being able to train an elite Somali army unit capable of defeating al Qaeda-linked militants on the ground. The commitment to the East African nation comes after the President has signaled a desire to reduce US troop levels across the globe and as the administration is in the process of withdrawing forces from Syria. While officials say the effort is making progress, they tell CNN that the US training mission is likely to not be completed until 2026. For nearly two years, a small team of US Special Operations forces has been embedded with the Somali National Army, assisting in the fight against the militant group Al-Shabaab. As well as advising on airstrikes and ground assaults, the Navy SEAL-led team's primary task is to train and build Somalia its own elite light infantry force. Read More Named Danab, which in Somali means lightning, the force currently numbers only about 500 soldiers, too few to carry out operations in a country with a coastline almost as long as the east coast of the US. The plan, US defense officials say, is to eventually build Danab into a force of 3,000 soldiers capable of clearing militants from villages and towns across Somalia. U.S. Army 101st Airborne Division soldiers deployed with U.S. Army Forces Africa stand with Somali National Army soldiers during a graduation ceremony May 24, 2017, in Mogadishu, Somalia. ""The plan is to build two companies a year, with the end-state being five battalions and a brigade headquarters element,"" Becky Farmer, a spokesperson for Africa Command which oversees US military operations on the continent, told CNN in a statement. ""We think it's going to take approximately seven years for the Somalis to absorb all of these forces,"" a defense official familiar with the US counterterrorism strategy in Somalia told CNN. ""If everything works out and however many miracles line up to make this happen it could go faster, and it could go slower,"" he added. A quarter century after the events surrounding ""Black Hawk Down,"" the incident that killed 18 US soldiers in Mogadishu, the US military finds itself more actively engaged in Somalia than at any time since. Though the US has higher troop levels in Niger and Djibouti, Somalia is the only place in Africa where the US military is regularly carrying out airstrikes against enemy forces. The Pentagon has about 500 to 600 personnel in Somalia according to US Africa Command. While US military advisers have been in Somalia since at least 2013, the effort has gotten a major boost under the Trump Administration, which volunteered to undertake the Danab advisory mission in 2017 in addition to expanding drone strikes, and in December reopened the American diplomatic mission in Mogadishu for the first time since 1991. Trump authorized the military to carry out precision strikes targeting Al-Shabaab in March 2017. Prior to that the US military was authorized to conduct airstrikes only in defense of advisers on the ground. So far this year, at least 255 fighters from Al-Shabaab have been killed in 30 airstrikes, according to figures released by US Africa Command. In 2018 the US conducted 47 airstrikes targeting Al-Shabaab, killing about 337 militants. In 2017 the US carried out 35 airstrikes and in 2016 it conducted just 15. ""The bottom line is we're taking formations and fighters and leaders off the battlefield. And that is having effect on the network,"" Brig. Gen. William West, the deputy director of operations for Africa Command, told CNN in a statement. The increase in airstrikes though has been criticized by some members of Congress and outside groups like Amnesty International, which has accused the US of killing civilians in Somalia. While the US military has rejected Amnesty's allegations, US Africa Command announced earlier this month that it had determined that one of its 2018 drone strikes had killed two civilians, the first ever such acknowledgment by the US military in Somalia. US military officials stress that the airstrikes are only one component of the US military's overall campaign in Somalia. ""Every strike we take, whether it's on the pace that we're on this year or on the pace that we've been on in previous years, is all done in support of the strategy. And the strategy supports the goals of security and stability in Somalia,"" Maj. Gen. Gregg Olson, the director of operations for US Africa Command said in a statement to CNN. The administration regards the fight against the militant group Al-Shabaab in Somalia as critical to protecting America's primary strategic allies in the region such as Kenya and Ethiopia which have been hit by Al Shabaab-linked terror attacks in the recent years. London Meeting The current strategy is partly a result of a May 2017 conference held in London, where a group of countries including the UK, US, Kenya and Ethiopia along with representatives from the UN, African Union and European Union, met to discuss the future of Somalia. For years the task of fighting Al-Shabaab in Somalia had fallen to the African Union-led peacekeeping mission, AMISOM. But in the months leading up to the London Conference, Al-Shabaab proved that it was still a potent force on the battlefield with its fighters overrunning three AMISOM bases, seizing weaponry, armored vehicles and ammunition. In London, a plan was agreed on that called for the creation of a regular army of 18,000 troops and 32,000 federal and state police to eventually replace the African Union-led peacekeeping mission, AMISOM which had spent years fighting Al-Shabaab. Then-Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis agreed that the US would take responsibility for ""training specific numbers of proficient and mobile light infantry capable of defeating Al-Shabaab,"" referring to the Danab unit. The rest of Somalia's security forces were to be trained by international advisers from the EU, Turkey and the UAE on a bilateral basis. Coordinating that effort has been a challenge, US officials say, and has led to some less than stellar results. A State Department official told CNN that while there have been some successes in integrating Somali troops trained by Turkish and UAE advisers into the national army, many of the 6,000 Somali troops trained by the EU did not join the national army and ""most of them have gone off to militias and local clans."" ""It is a work in progress,"" he added. The US military does attempt to coordinate these various efforts while also providing support to AMISOM troops via a military coordination cell that is led by a one star general in Mogadishu. Despite those previous misfires, US officials are confident that the focus of the US-effort, Danab, will stay loyal to the central government. ""Ultimately, the Danab as a unit fall under the central Somali government and we have no indications of dual loyalty,"" Farmer, the spokesperson for Africa, told CNN. US military officials say that in the past Al-Shabaab has exploited local grievances among the many clans that make-up Somalia as a means of gaining power so the US has made a concerted effort to ensure that the forces comprising Danab are representative of the areas where they operate helping to gain the trust of the locals, something that could be contributing to the slow pace of increasing its size. ""The Danab are clan-appropriate and integrated units of the Somali National Army, with one battalion aligned to each Federal Member State, in order to provide locally acceptable and trusted forces of the Somali National Army,"" Farmer said. ""The indications we've received on the ground are that the Somali people hold the Danab in the highest esteem as a result of these efforts,"" Farmer added. Signs of Progress American diplomats, military officers, and USAID officials all told CNN that they see progress in Somalia, with many citing increased security in major cities and towns and government reform efforts. Trump's extension of the emergency declaration came the same day Somalia's Prime Minister Hassan Khayre visited the White House for a meeting with Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton. Khayre, who has been praised by American diplomats and USAID officials for his efforts to reform Somalia's economy and security forces, also visited the Pentagon Thursday. One major success is the town of Kismayo, which was recaptured in 2012 after it was once considered an Al-Shabaab stronghold. US officials say that the Somali security forces have managed to expand the security bubble around Kismayo out some 25 miles from the town. USAID officials told CNN that at least 1,000 families have returned to Kismayo. Still, the focus remains on securing the areas around the capital Mogadishu where Al-Shabaab, despite having been driven from the city, can still carry out terror attacks. An attack last month killed dozens. The hope is that eventually the elite Somali troops will be able to drive Al-Shabaab from strategic corridors and areas near the capital, and keep them from attacking Mogadishu. For now though, the Somalis are still heavily reliant on US forces, particularly for functions like planning and intelligence. ""We're still involved in every single operation,"" a defense official told CNN. Though American advisers still accompany Somali troops out in the field, officials say they've taken steps to mitigate risks to US personnel. ""We always work to stay no closer than the last line of cover or concealment and we only go outside the wire when we do not think contact is expected or likely,"" a US defense official familiar with US intelligence in Somalia told CNN. It can still be a dangerous mission. Last month the US called in an airstrike in Somalia's Lower Shabelle Region after a Somali-led force that was being advised by US personnel came under attack. The last US soldier that was killed in Somalia was in June 2018, US Army Sgt. Alexander Conrad was killed and three other soldiers were wounded by ""indirect fire"" after they came under attack while helping local forces set up the kind of combat outpost the US military sees as critical to its strategy in Somalia. The US military estimates that Al-Shabaab commands somewhere between 5,000 to 7,000 fighters and still controls about 20% of Somalia's territory. It's a far cry from Al-Shabaab's heyday when it controlled most of the country including the towns of Kismayo and Baraawe and even some parts of the capital, Mogadishu. ""Folks in the United States, they think Blackhawk Down and things like that,"" a USAID official told CNN, saying that the country has made major improvements in recent years, thanks largely to the improved relationship between the US and Somali governments since the December re-establishment of the US diplomatic mission in Mogadishu, the first such presence since 1991. After the fighting A big part of making sure the military gains against Al-Shabaab are sustained is ensuring that forces are able to hold the recaptured territory. Doing that requires a healthy dose of humanitarian aid. But the US development aid budget to Somalia is limited, at only about $60 million according to USAID officials. ""We have a lean operation,"" one USAID official said. Things could get even leaner as the Trump administration's 2020 State Department budget request is seeking only $58 million in ""Economic Support and Development Funds for Somalia, a decrease of some $15 million from the previous year. The US does also provide hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to meet more short term emergency requirements like famine relief. And even if Al-Shabaab is defeated, officials say other security challenges remain. ""It's not just Al-Shabaab, There are clan grievances here that go back hundreds of years, that has to be sorted out too,"" one USAID official said."
Pete Buttigieg pushed a plan to revitalize South Bend. Not everyone felt its benefits. - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Dan Merica,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/pete-buttigieg-south-bend-record/index.html,"South Bend, Indiana (CNN) Stacey Odom was skeptical of Pete Buttigieg, when, in 2012, he became the young mayor here in South Bend.
Then 29-year-old Buttigieg won office on a plan of urban revitalization and data-driven governance. Newsweek had recently tagged South Bend as one of America's dying cities. So he laid out a plan: Get rid of urban blight, revitalize downtown and attract the kind of economy that had eluded South Bend ever since the car manufacturer Studebaker left town decades before, leaving a gaping hole -- both physically and mentally -- in the city of just over 100,000 Hoosiers. But for Odom, who is black and more than a decade older than Buttigieg, the mayor's primary idea for getting rid of urban decay -- expediting code enforcement in order to demolish 1,000 deteriorating houses in 1,000 days -- smacked of gentrification and reignited racial tensions in the city. ""I thought it was a mistake,"" Odom said outside a home she is trying to redevelop in the Monroe neighborhood. ""I don't think that he looked at every aspect of all the consequences of tearing down 1,000 homes in 1,000 days."" Read More Pence says Buttigieg bringing 'attacks on my Christian faith' With Buttigieg planning to officially launch his presidential bid in South Bend on Sunday, his record as mayor has come under scrutiny, with questions being raised about whether the city's revitalization has delivered for all of Sound Bend's denizens. And now that Buttigieg is leaving office to focus on his campaign, the race to replace him has turned into a tacit acknowledgment that the renewal, while popular, has not been felt by all residents. Candidates for mayor have all pledged to focus on revitalizing the city's neighborhoods like downtown; Jason Critchlow , a onetime political operative, is running ads saying that ""it's time to take the success we have had here ... to all over this city."" Buttigieg is set to make his eight years as mayor central to his presidential bid, especially the renewal that he has delivered to the small city. But as much as some residents of South Bend have touted the newly revitalized downtown, others -- primarily those from historically African American areas west of downtown -- have expressed reservations over how the renewal was not felt in their neighborhoods. Buttigieg, in an interview with CNN, said that ""overall"" he believes the program was ""certainly a success"" and ""primarily benefited low-income and minority homeowners who found that their safety and their property value was damaged by blight."" But the mayor admitted that the plan was not perfect and needed to be tweaked throughout based on feedback from neighborhoods where blight is the most apparent. ""The challenge with any policy, especially a controversial one, is you need to know when to stick to your guns when you really believe in something and get it done. But you also need to acknowledge, from the get-go, that you might be wrong,"" Buttigieg said, adding that the lessons he learned from these sorts of controversial projects have informed the kind of candidacy he is mounting for president. Winning people over The 1,000-home project -- coupled with all the time, energy and money Buttigieg committed to revitalizing downtown -- created distrust with some of South Bend's African American residents, who make up nearly 30% of the city's population. Much of that has yet to be fully resolved. The current unemployment rate among African Americans in South Bend is more than 11%, and a 2017 study by the city found that more than 40% of African Americans in the city live below the poverty line, a number that is nearly double the national rate for black households. But eight years removed from Buttigieg taking office, what has surprised many in South Bend -- including those who met Buttigieg's early plans with antipathy -- is that the mayor has won over many of his critics, including Odom and Republicans who had once questioned whether he could effectively lead their city. Odom's opinion of Buttigieg changed after a chance -- and blunt -- meeting downtown. Her home was on the demolition list and she wanted it off but was hitting roadblocks with the city. ""I saw Mayor Pete walking down the street, and I'm one of those people that if I see you somewhere, I don't care who you are, and I need something, I'll just run right up to you and ask you for what I want,"" Odom said with a laugh, recalling how she confronted the mayor. Odom was surprised that Buttigieg listened for 10 minutes, even though he was on his way to a meeting. His staff was anxious to get Buttigieg to move on, but the mayor handed her his card and the two struck up an ongoing conversation. Buttigieg later held a series of meeting with Odom and others to talk about the plan. She credits the mayor with getting her home off the demolition list -- and because of pressure from the community, 40% of other residents' homes were taken off too. ""When I saw that he was willing to help, that's what turned me,"" said Odom. ""That's what said to me, this is a man that has the potential to be president."" Buttigieg said it was experiences like the one he had with Odom that informed a facet of his approach to 2020. ""On one hand, I believe in conviction politics. I think you need to forcefully defend your values and explain why you believe in the things you believe in,"" he said. ""But one reason that you'll hear me not being too doctrinaire about some of these policy groups is an awareness that the reality in government is you're going to be adjusting the finer points of the policy, anyway."" 'Everybody wants a beautiful community, but ...' Regina Williams-Preston had a markedly different experience. She and her husband had bought three dilapidated houses in her neighborhood with plans to refurbish them and either sell them for a profit or create a business, like a day care for local kids. But when Williams-Preston's husband fell ill and was unable to renovate the houses, the properties landed on the city's demolition list and the family lost the properties that they had hoped would be investments. ""What was different was that (South Bend) condensed the project and the process of eliminating homes into a very short period of time,"" Williams-Preston said. ""Oftentimes when you try to do something really fast, you miss things. ... There was just this real concerted effort to make sure we hit that goal. Like anything that came in the way we had to change policy, we got it done so we can hit that target. But in the wake of that, people lost homes."" Pete Buttigieg's unlikely rise as a symbol of LGBT progress The experience lit a fire under Williams-Preston, who went on to create a group of local organizers that has become a force pushing against the Buttigieg administration. She then successfully ran for South Bend Common Council, the city council, in 2015 and is now running for mayor, looking to replace the man who motivated her to get into politics. Around South Bend, the effects of the demolition program are impossible to miss. Semi-urban blocks that were once packed with homes, particularly on the city's west side, now look more sparsely populated, with multiple lots in between remaining homes. The need for less housing was a byproduct of economic contraction in the city -- something that many similar municipalities have experienced -- but it has left a visible hole in certain neighborhoods. People close to Buttigieg say the urban blight project was a learning experience for him. In his pre-campaign memoir, ""Shortest Way Home,"" Buttigieg touted the project as a win for ""data-driven management."" But even he has recently admitted that it wasn't flawless. And government executives who worked closely with Buttigieg admit that the program did impact communities of color more directly, even though that wasn't the intention. ""It has had some disproportionate impact"" on minority communities, Gary Gilot, the president of Buttigieg's Board of Public Works, said in an interview. ""But the decision was color-blind. ... It was the right thing to do to deal with the blight. You have to remove it. If you have a cancer, you have to deal with it."" The complaints about the program from neighborhoods outside South Bend's city center were compounded by Buttigieg pouring resources and time into stimulating downtown, which created a sense that the mayor was focused on downtown at the expense of nearby communities. ""More resources could flow out into neighborhoods now that the downtown is becoming more vital,"" said Steve Fredman, a retired English professor who was close with the Buttigieg family long before the mayor was even born. ""And that is a campaign issue for people who are running (for mayor) right now."" In total, Buttigieg touts $850 million in investments since he took office in 2012. But people, like Williams-Preston, who remain uneasy about the mayor say much of that money flowed everywhere but the most impoverished communities. ""Everybody wants a beautiful community,"" she said, standing in LaSalle Park, the neighborhood that was changed by the program. ""But how can we do that in a way that doesn't push out poor people and people of color?"" Buttigieg said he sees complaints like the one leveled by Williams-Preston as ""expression of concern about inequality."" ""This is a city which is still a low-income city and one with a lot of inequality. So if you're on the west side, and I'm proud of everything we've done for the west side, but you're still in a low-income neighborhood,"" Buttigieg said. ""So anything that you see happening downtown could be perceived as something that you wish were coming to you."" He added: ""My job is to balance it out, knowing that we're going to have economic growth for the whole city if we have a strong urban core in the downtown, but at the same time not falling into some trickle-down fantasy that if we get that right, everybody's going to automatically be better off."" Stay awhile The heart of Buttigieg's plan for downtown was restructuring what has been a dilapidated city center: Upgrade the sidewalks, improve medians and give government grants to refurbish old buildings. But the most unique change was getting rid of one-way streets and five-lane boulevards that encouraged people to speed through downtown without a thought about the businesses in the area. Not everyone was in favor of the plan, which promised to also create more traffic in downtown South Bend. ""You tell your husband to stop (messing up) the streets downtown,"" a constituent told Buttigieg's husband, Chasten, in the grocery store one day, using an expletive, the mayor writes in his memoir. People close to the mayor told CNN that residents regularly used listening sessions that came to be known as ""Mayor's Night Out"" to vent. He would ""go face the piper at these Mayor Night Out things and people get a few minutes to vent their spleen,"" said Gilot, who added that sometimes the comments could get profane and gruff. Since then, however, the plan, according to nearly every South Bend resident CNN spoke to, has worked to revitalize downtown but has also made traffic worse. South Bend's downtown, while small, is bustling and now home to a number of locally owned businesses and restaurants. No one has seen this change more than Mark McDonnell, the owner of LaSalle Grill, a local downtown spot that opened 28 years ago. ""We had the problem of people blasting through south and north on five-lane roads, one-way, with no intention of stopping in South Bend, and it was just always a constant problem,"" said McDonnell, who -- despite being a Republican -- met with Buttigieg during his first run for mayor and told him that downtown looks like a ""drab ... Soviet-era city in the 1950s."" Buttigieg wants to 'change the channel' from Washington's 'mesmerizing horror show' In response, Buttigieg launched ""Smart Streets"" in 2013 and got the $25 million bond needed for it in 2015. ""This is the heart of the city,"" McDonnell said. ""The neighborhoods may be the soul of the city, but this is the heart, got to have a pumping heart to have anything else."" What makes McDonnell's story unique is that the eccentric business owner was skeptical of Buttigieg at first and, despite his affinity for the mayor, he voted for Donald Trump in 2016. As he approaches 2020 and the prospect of Buttigieg being the Democratic nominee, McDonnell's onetime skepticism of the mayor has given way to possible support. ""He would be at this point the only Democrat that I would consider voting for, I'll put it that way,"" McDonnell said. ""I don't totally agree with him on all the issues he has. ... (But) if we are to have a Democrat president, and chances are good, I would rather have somebody that was from South Bend."" ""I know I'll get a bunch of emails from friends after they see this, 'What are you thinking!' Well, I have to think what's best for South Bend, Indiana, the country, and Pete may be the best choice."""

— Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) April 13, 2019 The President on Friday tweeted out an edited video that used comments Omar made at the Council on American-Islamic Relations last month spliced with news footage of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. ""We will never forget!"" Trump wrote. Read More The under-a-minute video that Trump posted did not include Omar's comments in context. CNN has reached out to Omar's spokesperson for comment. Democrats defend Omar, rip Trump over 9/11 controversy ""For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it.

Here's who's winning under Trump's tax law - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/tax-reform-winners-and-losers/index.html,"(CNN) Tax day isn't until Monday, but there have already been some surprises for Americans filing their first income tax returns under President Donald Trump's 2017 law.
Let's start with the big one. While most Americans are paying less in taxes overall, many have been startled to find that their refunds have barely changed or are down -- making them feel like they lost, even if they're still coming out ahead. Below are some other ways to look at who is winning and losing under the law. And please take note: It's possible to both win and lose at the same time. Winning: Most US taxpayers The vast majority of American tax filers -- more than 65% -- will see their overall tax burden decrease by at least $100, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. See page 7 of this helpful analysis . Read More Slightly less than 30% of filers will see very little change in their tax liability and a small percentage, about 6%, will see an increase. These tax rate cuts for individual filers are not permanent like the corporate tax cuts, but they'll be in place until 2025. But while most Americans got a tax cut, most people don't seem to understand they got one. According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll out this week, only 17% of Americans think they're getting a tax cut while 28% said they will pay more. Winning: Most rich people The new tax law's benefits are tilted toward the wealthy, who will generally see greater benefits than other Americans. The largest cuts will go to the people who pay the most in tax, according to the Tax Policy Center , a think tank, which suggested that tax filers in the 95th to 99th percentile of income -- roughly between $308,000 and $733,000 -- would see the largest benefit as a portion of after-tax income. Most people in the bottom 20% income-wise will see little or no change in their tax liability, according to that report. Losing: Some rich people, probably in blue states About 14% of rich people making more than $1 million will see a tax increase. They're likely to be concentrated in states with high state and local taxes and they possibly have multiple homes. They used to be able to deduct a lot more of their state and local income taxes from their federal returns. Now those deductions are capped at $10,000. But the cap in deductions will likely hit people in the top 1% of wage earners in those states the hardest , although there will be people affected across the income spectrum. Really winning: Heirs of rich people The law more than doubled the amount that can pass to family members without triggering the estate tax , from about $5 million to more than $11 million for individuals and $22 million for married couples. That affects a relatively small number of Americans, but it means they'll be able to keep more of an estate. Still winning: Investors The rates for capital gains taxes did not change in the tax law and remain lower than the rates for wage income. So people making money primarily off investments will continue to pay less in taxes than people who depend mostly on salary income. Winning: Trump, maybe, although some other business owners won't win as much Most small business owners (and a lot of not-so-small business owners) include their profits on personal income tax returns instead of paying as corporations. Trump is presumably among these, although it's impossible to know since he has kept his tax returns from public view. Under the law, which the IRS clarified in January, certain types of business owners get a 20% tax deduction. Doctors and lawyers lost out on that exemption, however, along with Major League Baseball team owners. Winning: Red state filers who depend on refunds According to preliminary data from H&R Block, it is mostly red states, those that voted for Trump in 2016, who are getting the largest bump in tax refunds. Losing: Blue state filers who depend on refunds That H&R Block preliminary data shows that every one of the states where refunds are shrinking is blue. Of course, experts say you should aim to have no refund and no tax bill on tax day. But a lot of Americans rely on the refunds as a sort of forced savings plan. In the preliminary H&R Block data, some of the states with the largest decreases in tax liability are blue states with high state and local taxes, like New Jersey, California and Massachusetts. Filers in these high tax states averaged some of the largest tax cuts. They also saw some of the largest average decreases in refunds. Losing: People who thought a tax cut would mean a bigger refund According to preliminary 2018 tax filing season data from H&R Block , one of the nation's largest tax preparers, the average tax filing they've processed so far shows a 24.9% drop in tax liability. But because of the way the IRS changed its paycheck withholding, that cut was spread over the course of the year and refunds, on average, have barely moved. The government paid $6 billion less in refunds through March 29, according to the IRS, although the average refund, according to its data, is $2,873 and has shrunk less than 1% compared with last year. Losing: People who aren't getting a refund but maybe thought they would The government is paying out fewer refunds this year under the new tax law, according to preliminary IRS data on filings through March 29 . There have been 2.2% fewer refunds than last year, according to the IRS, but only 1.4% fewer returns processed. Winning: People doing their own taxes There was a 2.3% increase in the number of e-filed tax returns self-prepared by the filer, according to that IRS data from March 29. At more than 358 million, visits to IRS.gov are up more than 10% this year. That said, the new tax law preserves the deduction people can take for hiring an accountant (assuming they are not taking the standard deduction). Winning: People taking the standard deduction Taxes should get easier since the standard deduction nearly doubled to $12,200 for individuals and $24,400 for married couples. That means that most Americans will not itemize their tax returns and that caps on state and local tax deductions may not affect as many people as feared. Losing: Washington, DC, tax filers The capital is seeing the largest average refund drop, at 6.1%. It is also seeing the smallest decrease in average tax liability, 18% -- which is indeed a cut, but the smallest, on average, in the country. Winning forever: Corporations They got a massive rate cut, from 35% to 21%, starting in 2018 that's permanently enshrined in the new law. Losing: The US Treasury Because of all these tax cuts -- and especially the corporate cuts -- budget deficits are expected to skyrocket past $1 trillion per year starting in 2022 and stay there. With the national debt over $22 trillion, that means the US will ultimately have to make some hard choices. So enjoy that tax cut, everyone."

GOP legislators slap restrictions on voter-approved Medicaid expansion - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Tami Luhby,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/medicaid-expansion-states/index.html,"(CNN) Many residents in three deep-red states rejoiced last fall when voters approved Medicaid expansion, circumventing the objections of their elected representatives.
But the victories in Utah, Idaho and Nebraska -- which would have extended coverage to tens of thousands of residents in each state under the Obamacare provision -- have proven short-lived. This week, Idaho's GOP lawmakers and governor joined their peers in Utah and Nebraska in slapping work requirements and other restrictions on access to Medicaid. Idaho legislators had considered bills with less stringent measures, but ultimately rejected those. Medicaid expansion tied to fewer heart-related deaths, study finds ""We must encourage self-sufficiency among those receiving public assistance,"" Idaho Gov. Brad Little, a Republican, wrote to the president of the state Senate upon approving the bill. The moves demonstrate the enduring resistance among Republicans to adopting programs tied to the Affordable Care Act, even when voters themselves explicitly ask for them. Read More In all three states, certain Medicaid recipients, primarily working-age, non-disabled adults without dependents, will have to work or engage in other activities at least 20 hours a week to maintain their benefits. The repercussions of not doing so vary by state. In Idaho, enrollees are kicked off the program for at least two months. Nebraska's poor lose access to so-called prime coverage, which includes dental, vision and over-the-counter medication benefits. The states also made it more difficult for those just above poverty level to access Medicaid, even though Obamacare makes eligible those earning up to 138% of the poverty line, or about $12,500 for an individual. Utah is restricting coverage to those in poverty. In Nebraska, residents just over poverty must opt into Medicaid -- otherwise, they default into polices on the Obamacare exchanges, which are much pricier. Trump administration allows Utah to curtail voter-approved Medicaid expansion The states must still receive approval from the federal government, which recently lost a second court battle over work requirements in Kentucky and Arkansas. The Trump administration is appealing that decision. Advocates in all three states decried lawmakers' moves, saying they are ignoring the will of the people. Tens of thousands fewer people will gain coverage because of the restrictions. Also, work requirements will cost the states millions to administer. Judge strikes down Medicaid work requirements, again Recording the number of hours worked can be complicated, say opponents of work requirements. Some 18,000 people in Arkansas lost coverage last year, in part because they had a tough time with the online documentation system. Opponents are also skeptical that work mandates will help Medicaid enrollees become more independent. ""There's a reason why they aren't working,"" said state Rep. Ilana Rubel, an Idaho Democrat and House assistant minority leader. ""Layering on more punishment is very unlikely to produce the desired results."""
Trump's tax returns: House committee sends new letter to IRS demanding six years of records - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Lauren Fox,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/trump-tax-returns-house-letter-irs/index.html,"(CNN) House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal is not backing down on his request for six years of the President Donald Trump's personal and business tax returns, he writes In a new letter sent Saturday to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig.

""I expect a reply from the IRS by 5:00 p.m. on April 23, 2019. Please know that if you fail to comply, your failure will be interpreted as a denial of my request,"" Neal writes. The letter leans heavily into the committee's legal rational for the returns and Neal writes that, ""I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding my request, and the authority of the committee. Those concerns lack merit. Moreover, judicial precedent commands that none of the concerns raised can legitimately be used to deny the committee's request."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Saturday said he has ""not personally spoken"" to Attorney General William Barr about a congressional request made by Neal for Trump's tax returns. Read More When asked by CNN, the secretary told reporters that the Treasury's Department's legal office has been in consultation with the Justice Department's lawyers. ""Those conversation have started, but it would be premature for me to conclude how long that will take, because as I've said these are complicated issues,"" said Mnuchin, who was speaking on the sidelines of the annual International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington. ""And I think it's more important to the American taxpayers that we get this right than we hit an arbitrary deadline."" When asked by CNN whether he would be able reconcile concerns around the constitutionality of the request by Neal's new deadline of April 23, he said, ""I'm not going to make a commitment prematurely as to whether we will be able to conclude our legal review within that deadline or not. Obviously, given the importance of this issue we have people working on this diligently. But again I would just emphasize this is a decision that has enormous precedence in potentially weaponizing the IRS. ""The chairman gave us a deadline last time. Again, we responded by that deadline,"" said Mnuchin, who first saw Neal's letter earlier on Saturday on Twitter. ""The Chairman is giving us a new deadline. I'm sure we'll respond by that deadline."" READ: Neal's letter to the IRS The letter comes just days after the Treasury Department told Neal that it would not meet a one-week deadline to turn over the President's tax information and that it would instead consult with the Justice Department before responding further. Highlighting what he called the ""unprecedented nature of this request,"" Mnuchin wrote to Neal this week that he -- not the IRS commissioner -- would manage the Treasury's handling of the request and that the Justice Department was being consulted ""to ensure that our response is fully consistent with the law and Constitution."" ""The Committee's request raises serious issues concerning the constitutional scope of Congressional investigative authority, the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose, and the constitutional rights of American citizens,"" Mnuchin wrote. ""The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically-motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power."" The standoff between Congress and the administration over the request is expected to launch an unprecedented legal battle, one that will test for the first time in court a 1920s-era tax statute that was little known until recently. Democrats believe they have the power under IRS code 6103 to request Trump's tax information including, but not limited to his tax returns. The law states that three people: the House Ways and Means chairman, the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Chairman of Senate Finance can ask for anyone's personal tax information for their committee's use. Neal has argued that the committee needs Trump's tax information in order to conduct oversight of the Presidential audit program, a program that is not enshrined in law, but instead has become a routine procedure at the IRS that when a new President comes into office. The back-and-forth is just the beginning of a fight that has long been anticipated to weave its way through the courts. Democrats argue that 6103 requests are made all the time and are routinely handled through the IRS, not under the supervision of the treasury secretary. Republicans have dismissed Neal's request as unprecedented and political. Mnuchin himself has argued that requesting the President's personal tax returns now rises to a level that he needs to be involved."
"Survey: As many Americans claim no religion as there are evangelicals, Catholics - CNN",us.cnn.com,"Neil Monahan and Saeed Ahmed, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/no-religion-largest-group-first-time-usa-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) For the first time ""No Religion"" has topped a survey of Americans' religious identity, according to a new analysis by a political scientist. The non-religious edged out Catholics and evangelicals in the long-running General Social Survey.
Ryan Burge, a political scientist at Eastern Illinois University and a Baptist pastor, found that 23.1% of Americans now claim no religion. Catholics came in at 23.0%, and evangelicals were at 22.5%. The three groups remain within the margin of error of each other though, making it a statistical tie. Over 2,000 people were interviewed in person for the survey. A growing number of Americans reject organized religion Pope Francis leaves the Basilica of SantAnselmo on March 6, 2019 in Rome. Read More ""Religious nones,"" as they are called by researchers, are a diverse group made up of atheists, agnostics, the spiritual, and those who are no specific organized religion in particular. A rejection of organized religion is the common thread they share. ""It is the first time we have seen this. The same questions have been asked for 44 years,"" Burge told CNN. The meteoric rise of religious nones began in the early 1990s and has grown 266% since 1991, he said. Burge estimates that 'No Religion' will be the largest group outright in four to six years. The reasons why the numbers explode d Richard Dawkins posing for an atheist advertising campaign Experts still debate the factors behind this wave of Americans declaring no religion. One reason could be the internet, says Nick Fish, the president of American Atheists. It provides a place for nonbelievers to find each other. ""The ease of access to the internet helped build communities where they didn't feel alone,"" he says. Robyn Blumner, executive director of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science, sees the change as a generational trend driven by millennials. ""We are seeing the rise of a generation of Americans who are hungry for facts and curious about the world,"" she says. They are an underrepresented group Whatever the causes, the non-religious represent a growing constituency. Yet this demographic is greatly underrepresented in Washington's halls of power. There is not a single open atheist amid the most diverse Congress in history, according to a Pew study . The Congressional Freethought Caucus's 10 members try to represent non-theist interests while protecting the secular character of government. ""This growing group of Americans can feel like there is at least some people in Congress who believe they matter."" says the co-chair and founder, Rep. Jared Huffman of California."
Kratom deaths: CDC study finds the drug was a cause in nearly 100 deaths - CNN,us.cnn.com,Harmeet Kaur,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/health/kratom-deaths-cdc-study/index.html,"(CNN) A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that kratom was a cause of death in nearly 100 people over a 17-month period -- a higher number than previously reported.
The CDC analyzed reports of more than 27,000 unintentional drug overdoses across 32 states and Washington, D.C. The study said 152 of those people were found to have kratom in their system, and the drug was a cause of death for 91 of them. Earlier this year, the US Food and Drug Administration said that 44 deaths had been associated with the drug. About 80% of the people in the CDC study who had kratom in their system had a history of substance misuse. Almost all of them also had other substances in their system. Read More The other substances most commonly found were fentanyl, heroin, benzodiazepines (also known as tranquilizers), prescription opioids and cocaine. The number of people whose deaths were associated with kratom make up less than 1% of all overdose deaths. The report's authors say it's possible the numbers might be underestimated, although they can't say to what extent. Health officials have warned about kratom According to the American Kratom Association, nearly five million Americans consume kratom safely each year. The Southeast Asian plant is sold in pills, capsules and extracts. Some people brew the leaves as a tea, while others chew or smoke them. At low doses, kratom acts like a stimulant. At higher doses, it sedates dulling pain -- which has made it a popular over-the-counter remedy for opioid withdrawal. She drank kratom tea while pregnant. Then her newborn went into withdrawal But health officials have urged caution. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb likened the chemical compounds in kratom to opioids and said there was no evidence to indicate that it was safe or effective for ""any medical use."" He also cited concerns about its potential for abuse. ""Kratom should not be used to treat medical conditions, nor should it be used as an alternative to prescription opioids,"" Gottlieb said in a statement in 2018. The Drug Enforcement Administration lists kratom as a drug of concern but dropped a plan to classify it as a controlled substance after public outcry in 2016. US poison control centers saw the number of calls about kratom exposures increase from 13 in 2011 to 682 in 2017, often for serious unanticipated effects of the supplement, according to a study published earlier this year. ""Individuals who choose to use kratom need to be aware of the potential risks. Just because it is currently classified as an herbal supplement does not mean that it is regulated or that it is safe,"" Henry Spiller, director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children's Hospital, said in a statement in February. Researchers question the FDA's warnings Some scientists who study kratom disagree with the FDA's 2018 warning about the drug's potential for abuse. Scott Hemby, who chairs the Department of Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences at High Point University in North Carolina, researches ""addictiveness"" of kratom and spoke to CNN after the FDA issued its warning. Compounds in herbal supplement kratom are opioids, FDA says He found that two chemicals in kratom, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, can bond to the body's opioid receptors and act very much like opioids do, providing some pain relief and causing a release of dopamine. But it's at a much more toned-down level than prescription pills or heroin. Hemby did find that 7-hydroxymitragynine may have some addictive qualities, but when looking at kratom as a whole, the ratio of that element is so small that the drug has very low abuse potential, he told CNN."
Boston Marathon organizers prepare for another rainy race - CNN,us.cnn.com,"Theresa Waldrop, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/boston-marathon-bad-weather/index.html,"(CNN) With the possibility of a repeat of last year's cold, rainy race day, Boston Marathon organizers are making changes to Monday's run.
Those changes are aimed at keeping runners and the race's army of volunteers warm and dry. That's because of the forecast the Boston Athletic Association shared with runners in an advisory , saying there's ""the potential for persistent rain, wind, and cooler temperatures."" Or, pretty much a rerun of last year's miserable race. Among the changes, the organizers are adding heat to staging areas, volunteers will have ponchos and hand warmers, and medical stations are preparing for ""a potential overflow of runners,"" CNN affiliate 4WBZ in Boston reported . Read More Wave 4, the last group to start, will begin right after Wave 3 ends, the BAA said in its advisory. The new schedule does away with the previously planned 25-minute delay between waves, reducing the time runners would have to wait in bad weather. Boston Marathon Fast Facts Boston may be in for heavy rain and possibly a thunderstorm, according to the National Weather Service , and wind gusts could reach 28 mph. The chance of rain is 90% as of Saturday morning, but the forecast is calling for warmer temperatures than when the BAA issued its advisory. Come what may, though, the race will be held on April 15. ""The marathon is run on Patriots' Day or it's not run,"" BAA CEO Tom Grilk said Friday, according to 4WBZ."
Louisiana churches fire: Pastors relieved after arrest and ready for healing to begin - CNN,us.cnn.com,"Christina Maxouris, Samira Said",04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/louisiana-church-fires-saturday/index.html,"(CNN) Pastor Harry Richard is ready to help his community begin healing.
The pastor led the Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas before it was burned to the ground on April 2. Just a week earlier, St. Mary Baptist Church in Porte Barre had been set ablaze, and on April 4, Mount Pleasant Baptist Church was the last to burn. Louisiana arson suspect expressed disgust with Baptist churches on Facebook Authorities have arrested Holden Matthews, 21, in connection with the church fires that terrified the communities in Louisiana. ""Now, my concern is when do we get back to normal,"" Richard told CNN affiliate KLFY. ""When do we put our church family back in their home?"" Suspect allegedly influenced by music Read More Matthews is charged with three counts of simple arson on a religious building, State Fire Marshal H. ""Butch"" Browning said. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 15 years. The suspect has no history of violence or prior arrests, and he may have been influenced by ""black metal"" music and its ""associated history with church burnings,"" authorities said. Browning confirmed the fires were intentionally set. The suspect's father is a local sheriff's deputy who broke down when he found out about Matthew's involvement with the fires, St. Landry Parish Sheriff Bobby Guidroz said. ""He was shocked and hurt as any father would be,"" Guidroz said. ""He was in terrible shape."" Browning says they're not looking for any other suspects, but the investigation is still ongoing. ""I was hoping that this is the only individual involved and that now we can start healing,"" Richard told KLFY. ""I'm excited for what God is going to do in the community."" A time for recovery Congregants have been attending service in nearby churches and their leaders are ready to begin the recovery process. ""It started off a dark moment in our lives, but with the rebuilding process you're going to see some things ... that are going to be very bright for our churches,"" Mount Pleasant Baptist Church Pastor Gerald Toussaint said. Pastor Easton Shelvin of Truth is Ministries told KLFY the way forward for the community is prayer and an increase in faith. ""People who trust in God really need to see God is allowing things to happen to catch our attention,"" he told the affiliate. ""I think God set us up to be a great light right now."" Their church was burning. They linked arms and prayed He said he believes people who ""do those kinds of acts are lost and searching for attention."" CNN learned Matthews had previously expressed disgust with Baptist beliefs on Facebook. Responding to a post about ""afrikan spirituality,"" Matthews, posting under the name Noctis Matthews, said he cannot ""stand all these baptists around here, bunch of brainwashed people trying to find happiness in a religion that was forced on their ancestors just as it was on mine."" He also said he wished that ""most blacks [sic] people would look into ancient beliefs of pre Christian Africa."" CNN reached out to Matthews' lawyer and the prosecutor's office but have not yet received a response. When CNN asked authorities if they were aware of the posting, they said because the investigation was ongoing, they would not detail any particular leads they are following. Following the clues According to a court affidavit, it was the charred remains of a Scepter-branded, gallon gas can that led authorities to Matthews. Surveillance cameras captured a pick up truck believed to have been driven by Matthews minutes before the Greater Union Baptist Church caught on fire. The gas can was discovered by federal ATF agents on Tuesday at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, the affidavit said. Investigators learned that a Walmart in Opelousas was a local seller of the Scepter-branded can. Congregants were 'robbed of their sacred space' but not ruined. The story behind this photo Walmart then informed the investigators two cans were purchased on March 25 -- less than 3 hours before the first fire -- along with a 10-pack of automotive cloths and a lighter, the affidavit states. The receipt showed the purchase was made with a debit card in the name of Holden Matthews. Investigators also obtained surveillance photos of the purchaser and the pickup he was driving. The affidavit said a Ford pickup like the one Matthews was driving was registered to the suspect's father. Matthews' cell phone was traced to the area of the fires."

Cory Booker kicks off two-week national tour with Newark rally - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Rebecca Buck,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/cory-booker-rally-2020/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Over the past two months, since his buzzy launch February 1, Sen. Cory Booker's campaign has gone relatively quiet — methodically grinding away under the guiding philosophy: ""You've got to organize, and get hot at the end.""
""We're trying to win the election,"" Booker's campaign manager Addisu Demissie told reporters Thursday. ""We're not trying to win a news cycle."" But that slow-and-steady pace now seems poised to pick up. Booker will step back into the spotlight Saturday in Newark, with his first major rally as a candidate. The event will kick off a two-week national tour for Booker, which in its first week will take him to Iowa, Georgia and Nevada. In his remarks, he will lay out his broad vision for the country, oriented around the theme of creating a more just society. It also comes at a moment of trial, with Booker's momentum apparently stalling after a muted start. In two polls released this week, by Monmouth University out of Iowa and St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, Booker's support registered in the low single-digits, lagging behind half a dozen other candidates. Read More Those numbers follow a middling first fundraising quarter for the New Jersey senator, who reported raising $5 million — enough to sustain a campaign operation, but far less than top fundraisers Bernie Sanders ($18.9 million) and Kamala Harris ($12 million), and even trailing newcomer Pete Buttigieg ($7 million). Booker's campaign has attempted to downplay that gap: ""The raw numbers of money is irrelevant,"" Demissie said Thursday. ""It has to be connected to a strategy."" 'Mayor Pete' surges into the top 10 in our 2020 rankings That strategy has been to build slowly, putting the pieces in place now, particularly on the ground in early primary states, to make the most of a breakthrough moment later on. But Demissie acknowledges the need ""to stay relevant in the conversation"" in the meantime, amidst a competitive and increasingly crowded Democratic field — and so the campaign is beginning to ramp up its public exposure, beginning with the rally Saturday in Newark. ""Now, it's phase two,"" said Robert Wolf, an influential Democratic donor, who gave money to Booker and four other candidates in the first quarter: Harris, Buttigieg, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke. At this juncture, Booker ""needs to continue to creep up in the polls and really solidify himself in the top half dozen"" candidates, Wolf added — and Booker's rally in Newark could mark a major moment in that effort. ""Everyone has one day to launch,"" said Wolf, ""so it's an important day for him."" As with Harris' kickoff rally in Oakland and O'Rourke's in El Paso, Booker's event will be set in a place central to his biography: Newark, where Booker won a city council seat as a 29-year-old political upstart, beating a longtime incumbent, and then went on to challenge longtime incumbent Mayor Sharpe James. In a Democratic field that could balloon into the twenties, Booker points to his political and governance education in Newark as his special sauce. In his narrow loss to James in 2002, Booker learned the art of political combat. And, after he came back to win the mayorship in 2006, he worked to transform the city as its chief executive. On Saturday, Booker himself is not expected to focus on that piece of his biography. But his event, and a roster of other speakers, will help him do the talking. The kickoff rally will take place in downtown Military Park, a public space that underwent a dramatic makeover under Booker, nearby a Whole Foods that Booker helped bring to the city. On hand to introduce Booker will be his successor as mayor, Ras Baraka, as well as Sen. Bob Menendez and Gov. Phil Murphy, among others. Booker's story has so far been eclipsed by those of other ascendant candidates , however — including another mayor, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend. Buttigieg benefits from a certain degree of novelty relative to Booker, who was in his own Wunderkind Mayor phase more than a decade ago. Incidentally, Buttigieg will hold his own rally this weekend in South Bend, to officially announce his campaign for president after an exploratory phase. But Booker will be launching a new phase of sorts as well, beginning to hone his campaign narrative and home in on a central theme of justice. Here's why you can't discount Joe Biden's early polling lead Booker's organization was ""very intentional in wanting to do this at this point in the campaign"" as opposed to when Booker first jumped into the race in February, Demissie said, ""...as a moment to be able to say clearly and above the din of what's happening on a daily basis, why Cory's in the race and what he's fighting for."" The campaign will expand its reach in the coming weeks, with plans for Booker to visit Georgia, California, Wisconsin, Texas and Florida for the first time as a candidate. And they will begin hiring in Super Tuesday primary states soon, campaign officials said Thursday, now that their teams on the ground in the first four primary states are up and running. Booker is also making a turn toward a more pronounced policy focus. During a swing through New Hampshire last week, Booker tailored his stump speech to get more into the weeds of his ""baby bonds"" proposal, which would fund a savings account for every child in America until age 18, in an effort to diminish inequality. ""Not just sentiments,"" Booker told the crowd last week at Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network conference. ""I'm fighting to deliver substance."" That appearance drew rave reviews for Booker, as did his remarks this week at the North American Building Trades Unions. His team hopes to continue racking up such momentum slowly and methodically, confident that the Democratic field remains wide open. ""They don't need a breakthrough moment at this point,"" said Mo Elleithee, executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics, and a former Democratic operative. ""They need an infrastructure — so that when he does have a breakthrough moment, he can capitalize on it and sustain it."" Plus, breakthrough moments — like bolts of political lightning — can be ""fleeting,"" Elleithee added. ""It's narrative that wins. That's what he needs to focus on, is getting his narrative out there."""

He was working to fortify a foxhole when a heavy beam came flying off a truck and struck him in the head. The injury not only ended his military career, it left him fighting for his life and later, battling PTSD and depression. Vallieres couldn't work but he could volunteer, and he spotted a New Hampshire Audubon ad looking for help tracking peregrine falcons and bald eagles, whose populations had once fallen from insecticide use.

When Osnos tried to use the device, he found that the crafty kid had tried and failed to enter his password so many times that he successfully locked the iPad for more than 25 million minutes -- or until the year 2067 .

But not Judge Craig Mitchell, who l eads a group called the Skid Row Running Club on jogs through downtown LA twice a week before sunrise . The group is open to runners from all walks of life: Some are homeless or in recovery, others are successful lawyers and business owners. Everyone who participates is looking for a positive start to their day, and Mitchell's club has inspired several at-risk runners to turn their lives around. Who knew? Good news for prospective space travelers! Humans are a resilient species, so much so that we can apparently spend a year in space with few lingering health impacts.

We curse them when they're choked with traffic or riddled with potholes. But in some rural areas, decent roads are non-existent, forcing people to trek miles just to get access to basic needs.
