"Molly Case, the nurse who finds poetry on the wards | Books | The Guardian",www.theguardian.com,Lisa O'Kelly,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/03/molly-case-nhs-nurse-finds-poetry-on-the-wards-memoir,"The student nurse whose impassioned poem about the NHS went viral talks about her new memoir. N ot so long ago, first-person accounts of what goes on in the operating theatre or the emergency ward – and in the hearts and minds of those who work there – were hard to find. Author William Boyd said recently that when writing his novel about a surgeon, The Blue Afternoon , some years ago, he failed to unearth any descriptions of surgery by surgeons at all. But no more. The medical memoir has become a publishing phenomenon.
Atul Gawande’s Being Mortal ; Do No Harm by neurosurgeon Henry Marsh; Paul Kalanithi’s When Breath Becomes Air ; Fragile Lives by heart surgeon Stephen Westaby (whose next book, The Knife’s Edge is just out); This Is Going to Hurt by Adam Kay; The Language of Kindness by nurse Christie Watson; War Doctor by the humanitarian surgeon David Nott – the list goes on. It is as if the medical profession has all of a sudden found its voice. Many of these memoirs have won prizes and several were bestsellers: Kay’s has been in the top 10 for 19 months.
Molly Case joins their ranks next week with a powerful account of her life as a cardiac nurse, How to Treat People . She has a theory about why there is such an appetite for dispatches from the operating theatre and the intensive care unit, where matters of life and death are part of the daily round. “Modern life is so frantic and everybody is so busy clicking things online and rushing around that there’s this collective need for introspection. People want to look inward at their bodies and minds. They want to unpick how society works and find out what makes the people looking after them tick,” she says.
Case first caught the public eye six years ago as a student nurse, aged 24, when she performed her poem Nursing the Nation in front of a packed auditorium at the Royal College of Nursing’s annual congress. Her electrifying recital, with its battle cry “Hear us goddamn roar”, received a standing ovation and has been viewed almost half a million times on YouTube. Case went on to perform her poetry at the Glastonbury festival and across Britain and Europe. Her debut collection, Underneath the Roses Where I Remembered Everything , was published in 2015.
What got her up on her feet that day at the RCN congress? “I was frightened and demoralised, going into my second year of training for a profession in which I saw people who really couldn’t work any harder being relentlessly criticised in the media. I felt it was time we stood up and told people just how wonderful we are,” she says. Her memoir has quite a different feel. Rather than an angry call to arms, it is an eloquent homage to the NHS and all those who work for it; a hymn to the art and science of nursing itself. “I wanted to celebrate this incredible career I feel so joyous to have and the amazing community of people I work with,” she says. The book is a personal story, too, which tells the tales of patients she has known. And threaded through it is a love letter to her father, the veteran music journalist Brian Case, whose failing health brought him into Case’s own cardiothoracic ward for a heart bypass last year.
 Watch Molly Case performing Nursing the Nation at the RCN congress.
Case no longer feels the need to defend her profession; the detractors who disparaged NHS workers a few years ago have melted away. “It’s a different time,” she says. “The popular press view us as the good guys now. I think that is partly and unfortunately due to terrorist attacks all over the country and horrendous events such as the Grenfell fire. These atrocities have revealed the worth of public sector workers – nurses, doctors, paramedics, firefighters – who seem to have their heads screwed on, while the people who are supposed to be leading us are in meltdown.”
How to Treat People is not overtly political but implicit in the stories Case tells is just how difficult her job has been made by 10 years of austerity. “Staffing levels are frightening,” she says. “Too often there are too few staff not only to do the job you’re there to do but to do anything above and beyond. My job is really incredibly simple. It sounds corny but I’m there to help people, to care for them and make them feel better. It’s not rocket science. Not be able to do that is frustrating to say the least. The job is busy, your bottom doesn’t touch the chair, you’re on your feet for 12 hours, which is fine. I enjoy that way of working but if you have too many patients you can’t provide anything extra. You can’t even offer them a wash in the morning, one of the most basic fundamentals of care.” Even worse is when what she is doing feels unsafe: “You catch eyes with your colleague on a short-staffed shift and you both know that you are flying by the seat of your pants and you are lucky that nothing has gone wrong. It’s so depressing and this is why nurses are leaving.”
I ask her if she ever thinks of giving up. “God, no. It’s such a privilege to do this job. It’s the opposite of selfless for me because of the enjoyment I get doing it. I get a huge buzz from people trusting me and allowing me to make them feel better. There’s nothing like it. And it’s great as a writer because you get so many ideas.”
It’s no great surprise to learn that this accomplished writer has a first-class degree in English and creative writing, from Bath Spa University. She only decided to train as a nurse halfway through her studies, after taking a part-time job in a care home for elderly people. “I’d only ever worked in coffee shops before; I’d never had experience of looking after people and I found I loved it. It was so formative. I adored talking to them, being with them, hearing their stories, helping them to go to sleep, tucking them in,” she says. Eight years on, she has just become a nurse specialist in inherited cardiac conditions. It is tough, not just on an emotional and physical level. “You use your brain all the time. People don’t realise how intellectually challenging it is. You’re making difficult decisions all the time.”
Chance the Rapper's music has brought me so much peace and joy and excitement and inspiration
Do writing and making poetry help her to process the psychological demands of the job? “It’s more positive than that and more exciting,” she says. “Poetry for me is what I assume drug-taking must be like. It is a buzz, it is a hit. If I have a new poem or an idea for one in my head I don’t want to eat, I don’t want to sit still, I don’t want to sleep. Having an idea marinating in my head is absolute joy. I’m so grateful that I have writing in my life.”
Case’s literary influences seem surprising – until you listen closely to the recurring rhymes and rhythms of her verse and the penny drops. “I grew up on a smorgasbord of hip-hop and rappers,” she says. “I used to think, come on, I’m a white middle-class girl from Bromley, this isn’t supposed to be my music, it’s not been made for me, it’s not my story to tell. But still, I was hugely drawn to the literary devices and poetic techniques of these artists and the seductive quality of the way they rhyme and I still very much am.” Favourites include Eminem, NWA, Common and Kate Tempest. And How to Treat People was partly inspired by listening to the same album over and over again: Colouring Book by Chicago artist Chance the Rapper. “It’s very spiritual. It really is absolute poetry, and when he performs it is often very stripped back, like spoken word. His music has brought me so much peace and joy and excitement and inspiration.”
Nursing, however, provides the most inspiration of all. “It was my big challenge to myself when I started training – could I be both a poet and a nurse? And my answer is yes. On the wards, I see poetry in the everyday, day after day.”

A nurse’s work: ‘I took a pair of gloves and tried to remove the piercing. It held’ | Society,www.theguardian.com,theguardian.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/07/how-to-treat-people-nurse-at-work-molly-case-extract,"A man preparing for his op reveals some stubborn metalwork in this extract from Molly Case’s memoir, How to Treat People. I started my career as a cardiac nurse on the vascular ward in a central London hospital. It was a busy ward that looked after people awaiting or recovering from surgery to unblock the veins and arteries in their legs. It was my first night shift as a qualified nurse. I was allocated eight patients, some post-operative and recovering, and one awaiting surgery the next day. There were three nurses on the shift, including myself. We took our handovers from the day staff and went to meet our patients. The nurse in charge for the night was called Matilda. She had been working night shifts for the past 20 years. We hadn’t worked together before, and she draped her arm softly around my shoulders as she discussed my patients with me. Then she looked me in the eye and smiled – she had one gold tooth that gleamed in the light – before going to greet her own patients for the night with jazz hands.
I walked slowly down the corridor, my mind full of what I had to do. What time should I start my drug round? What time should I start mixing my intravenous medication? What time should I start recording observations on my patients? I could already hear buzzers ringing at the other end of the ward, the linoleum lit up by the flashing orange call-bells.
I spent my first night shift as a student nurse on a quiet orthopaedic ward in the hospital up the hill from my home, where I had had my own surgery as a teenager and where my sister Daisy worked in the birth centre.
I was given the second break, and the nurse in charge told me to take it in the staff room. To my surprise, she had set up a camp bed in the middle of the room, with the sheets perfectly turned down over a hospital blanket. It looked like a mirage after seven hours on my feet and midnight already a couple of hours gone. Despite this, I remember not feeling tired. I had been so nervous about my first night shift that my brain felt wired, buzzing and alert, ready to learn. Nevertheless, I got into the bed.
I’ve seen her on ward rounds. She gets so cross. She shouts all the time; even the patients are frightened of her
There was a knock at the door; it was the nurse in charge. I quickly kicked off the sheets, thinking perhaps the bed wasn’t actually meant for me. She smiled and ushered me back into it. She advised me not to set my phone alarm as I was right next to the female patients’ bay and it might disturb them. She assured me she would wake me up in an hour’s time, and closed the door softly behind her. I lay there in the dark, listening to the sounds of the hospital around me.
It turned out to be the longest one-hour break I had ever experienced. When the knock on the staff room door eventually came, I rolled over quickly and checked my phone: it was six o’clock in the morning. I had been asleep for four hours!
I jumped out of the camp bed, my student uniform creased. When I opened the door, I saw the smiling faces of my qualified colleagues, all three of them barely able to contain their laughter.
“Did you sleep well?” the nurse in charge whispered, trying her best to hide her grin.
“I am so sorry,” I said. “I slept through my alarm.”
She nodded. “No you didn’t, remember?”
I thought back to the early hours and recalled being advised not to set it. I looked at her and her face broke into a smirk. The other nurses laughed and one of them pulled me close and hugged me.
“It’s OK,” she said. “Don’t look so worried. You have another 40 years of night shifts; we thought we’d start you off gently.” I could hear her heartbeat through her uniform.
“But you three didn’t get to take your breaks,” I said.
“We rested,” she said. “And we talked. It was a quiet shift.”
I straightened my uniform and tied my hair back. The morning sun was peeping through the windows and the ward was waking up.

Back on my first night shift as a qualified nurse on the vascular ward, I felt the weight of my responsibilities upon me. I was no longer a student. These were my patients for the night. They relied on me, and the safekeeping of their hearts, lungs and limbs depended on my skill as a nurse.
I went to check on the patient awaiting theatre tomorrow. Louis was a 70-year-old man due to have vascular surgery on his right leg.
I introduced myself and took his observations, recording them on the computer. I told him that I would help to prepare him for surgery the next day; that I would need to shave the hair on his body and he would have to wash with antiseptic scrub. Louis seemed relaxed about the operation; he smiled at me when I asked if he felt nervous, and shook his head.
“I’ll be pleased to have it done,” he said. “Then I can get on with my life.” He told me he would be staying after his operation with his partner, who had taken some time off work in order to look after him at home.
“She’s good to me,” he grinned. “I’m 20 years older than her and I’m sure she’d much rather be at work instead of nursing me, but what can I say? I’m a lucky man.”
“I’m sure you both look after each other,” I said.
He smiled and nodded. “I didn’t think I’d find someone at my age…”
He zipped his toiletry bag and placed it on his neatly folded clothes, then turned to face me, sitting on the edge of his bed.
“So,” he said. “You need me washed, shaved and shined, is that right?”
“That’s right,” I said. “I’ll see to a few other patients first and come back to you with everything I need, if that’s OK?”
By the time I had finished the rest of my tasks, it was almost midnight. I felt behind in my work and knew it was unfair to leave Louis’s preparation so late, but numerous patients were bedbound and had required assistance using the bedpan, and the medication round was delayed.
Eventually I went back to Louis. I apologised to him but he wouldn’t hear of it. “Not an issue,” he said. “Now, what’s first?”
“Let’s do the theatre checklist,” I said, sitting down beside the bed.
“Great! This is where you ask about wooden legs and shrapnel, right?”
“Almost,” I said.
I asked him whether he had any false or loose teeth.
“A plate at the top,” he said.
“That’s fine,” I said. “We’ll put it somewhere safe in the morning. Latex allergy?”
“No,” he said.
“Any metalwork at all in your body, hips, knees, joints?”
He shook his head again, and then stopped. “Jewellery count?”
I glanced up. “You can take that off in the morning,” I told him, looking for a ring on his finger.
“I have some body piercings,” he said. He pulled up his T- shirt to show me a large nipple ring.
“That will have to come out,” I said, and looked back at the checklist.
“And one here as well.” He indicated towards his groin.
“Ah…” I said. “Will you be able to remove that? Perhaps when you have your shower, you could try and take both of them out?”
He grimaced and laughed a little. “They’re both new. I haven’t taken them out since I had them done.”
I completed the checklist and left Louis to shower and try and take out his piercings. I would shave him afterwards. When I went back a few minutes later to check on him, he was back in his room with his hospital gown on.
“How did it go?” I asked.
“I got one,” he said, gesturing to his chest. “I’m really sorry, I just can’t unscrew the other one. I assume it will have to come out?”

“It will,” I said.
I shut the door to his room and shaved the hair from his legs and groin, making sure the skin I didn’t need exposed was covered.
“Right,” I said. “Let me get some gloves…” I took a pair of gloves from the wall and attempted to remove the piercing. It held fast.
“I’m so sorry,” Louis said.
“It’s OK,” I said. “I’m sorry if I’m hurting you.” I held the metal between my fingers and tried to twist, but it wouldn’t move. “Perhaps you could try again?”
I left Louis in the privacy of his room to have another go at removing the piercing. Maribel, the other nurse on the night shift, was sitting at the nurses’ station computer.
“I’ve got a problem,” I said quietly to her. “The man I’m preparing for theatre has some… metalwork. I can’t get it out.”
“Oh,” she said. She looked up to one side as if sifting through her wealth of experience to provide an answer for me. “Would you like me to try?”
I nodded. Maribel went to Louis’s room and returned soon after.
“It’s stuck,” she said. “You will have to ring the doctor and tell him.”
I bleeped him, but there was no response.
“Try the registrar,” Maribel said.
She must have noticed my expression. “It’s OK, Ms Madeira is a kitten. I don’t know why everybody is scared of her.”
“I’ve seen her on ward rounds,” I said. “She gets so cross. She shouts all the time; even the patients are frightened of her.”
Maribel laughed. “His surgery will be cancelled if you don’t get that padlock out.”
“Oh, don’t…” I said. I stared down at the paperwork I had prepared: the theatre checklist, the blood results, CT report, ECGs, all the information that had been assembled to get Louis this far. The thought of his operation being cancelled over this made my stomach sink.
I picked up the phone and bleeped the registrar on call. Five minutes passed, and then the phone rang, cutting through the quiet. “Hello, Ward 16, staff nurse speaking.”
“I had a bleep.” It was Ms Madeira; her voice sounded far away.
“I’m so sorry to disturb you…” I began.
“What is it?”
“Mr Sinclair. He’s having a fem-pop bypass tomorrow.”
“I know that.”
“He has a genital piercing I can’t remove.”
There was silence down the line. I tried to imagine what the senior registrar was doing.
“A genital piercing?”
“Yes,” I said.
“And you can’t remove it?”
“No,” I said. “I’ve tried, we all have.”
“Get Karl, the duty doctor, ” Ms Madeira ordered.
“I think he’s on another ward, I can’t get through,” I said quietly.
There was silence again. I thought I could hear the hum of a vending machine in the background. I imagined Ms Madeira’s face lit up in white-blue.
“You want me to attend?”
“I’m so sorry,” I said.
“I can’t believe this…” She hung up and I heard the dial tone.
Ms Madeira arrived an hour later. She was wearing a black suit with a thick gold necklace peeping above her collar and a handbag with a chunky gold clasp strapped across her chest.
“Where is he?” she said.
I showed her into Louis’s room. He was asleep. She turned the lights on and he woke.
“Mr Sinclair,” she greeted him. “Your surgery is tomorrow. Can I look at this?” She signalled towards his lower half and he removed the blanket and his underwear quickly.
I covered as much of him as I could so that only the required part was exposed.
Ms Madeira dropped to her knees. I knelt on the other side of the bed, ready to assist.
“OK?” I half smiled at Louis. He nodded and rested his head back with his eyes closed. He said sorry very quietly once again.
“Hold,” Ms Madeira said to me. I held Louis’s penis between two gloved fingers.
She began working quickly as if she were a burglar trying to pick a lock. I could see why she might have chosen to specialise in vascular surgery: her fingers were long and slim, almost as if they were surgical instruments themselves. It seemed as if she had a strategy, but every time I thought the padlock had unscrewed, she would bite her lip and sigh, indicating that it had not.
“Any luck?” Louis ventured.
“Not yet, Mr Sinclair,” Ms Madeira said. Outside the door, the ward was quiet. I hoped neither Matilda nor Maribel would peer through the glass. The doctor continued. I had never kept still for so long; I could feel my hand starting to cramp. “Graças a Deus!” Ms Madeira said suddenly. “It’s moving.”
Louis wiped his brow. I felt my hand relax a little.
“We’ve done it.” She pulled the piercing free. I glanced at her and saw she was looking at me. I nodded.
“You have a good steady hand,” she said, and with that she stood up, removed her gloves, straightened her trousers, washed her hands and bid us both goodnight.
Louis and I smiled at each other. “Please get some sleep now,” I said.
He nodded and tucked himself in. “See you in the morning,” I added.
“Graças a Deus!” he replied as I closed the door behind me.

This wouldn't be the EU interfering with sovereign issues in the UK - it would simply be their negotiating stance...giving us an option and leaving it to us what we do.
Macron said credible justifications for an article 50 extension could include an election, ""second referendum"" or alternative proposals for the future relationship, such as a customs union.
A GE will not solve Brexit, and a customs union is worse than what we have.
The EU already suggested only a major change would see them grant a longer extension - they suggested a second referendum or GE would facilitate a longer extension. They're not 'telling us what to do' as such...they're giving us the options; but essentially it's the same difference.

The answer lies with Corbyn and Labour, just as the problem rested with the passionless campaign and we now know hypocritical behaviour by Corbyn in 2016.
Still if he is ever to achieve anything, instead of carping from the sidelines, Corbyn has a chance to chart a path to a Brexit solution and almost certainly to power, by acting as a grown up in the room and going for May's deal subject to a confirmatory people's vote.

But May's problem is that it is ""May's"" deal.

1. The referendum was ADVISORY. It no way shape or form was it legally binding. All it takes is someone with the courage to tell people that the Brexit they were wishing for (and there are more than one type) is simply not deliverable in the real world. I could hold a referendum that my wife and I want to get wiser with age, but not suffer the bodily decline. All jolly well and non-binding and equally as undeliverable as the unicorn-Brexit people voted for in 2016.
2. The 52% majority for leave is a myth. In real-world terms Remain had a solid majority. The 52% votes for leave are a fata-morgana as they are an aggregate of different kinds on Brexits that people wanted, but they were forced all into one vote as there were only to boxes one could tick. It was a binary result for an analog choice. That's why the Leave campaigners are so mortally afraid of a confirmatory public vote, because they know that now many leavers, who wouldn't get their preferred type of Brexit will most likely prefer to vote remain than going for an even worde outcome.
The lies in the leave campaign have been exposed. It is now obvious that the 2016 referendum was a con deal to save the Tories from imploding. Scotland is chomping at the bit to get out of the union and anyone who still presses on with the madness is putting own or party interest ahead of the country.
Every halfway realistic person would say that revoke is the only sensible option here, but the atmosphere has become so toxic, it would probably lead to riots. So in that sense, only a confirmatory referendum - legally binding this time - is the only option left."

I t was before sunrise on a wintry morning that we gathered on a street corner in north London – a clutch of council officials, two police officers and myself. At a signal, the officials hammered on the doors of two tatty maisonettes above a surgery and waved warrants at the bleary faces that appeared in the windows.
This was a dawn raid on two of the myriad houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) being let without a licence in London and was part of a council crackdown on landlords and lettings agencies that flout the law to exploit tenants.
The flats, off a walkway strewn with abandoned furniture, had been operated by Lifestyle Club LSC, a lettings agency exposed by the Observer last year that got around tenancy laws by styling itself a “membership club”. Instead of tenancy agreements, the occupants signed up to club “membership”, which exposed them to unannounced inspections, fines for untidiness and eviction without reason with seven days’ notice.
Inside the flats, conditions showed the hazards faced by young tenants on low incomes seeking to make a life in the capital. Electrical wires sprouted from the hall wall in one and snaked across the floor, and the boiler bore an Elastoplast scrawled with the date of the last safety inspection a year previously.
Next door, the sole smoke alarm didn’t work, the poorly fitted doors were a fire risk and a lounge had been converted into two bedrooms so crudely the partition divided the radiator and window, so the occupant of one half could not adjust the heating or ventilation.
The nine tenants sharing the cramped conditions were all in their 20s and from overseas. Those I spoke to had jobs but could not afford the average London rent and had little understanding of tenancy rights.
One, who paid £585 a month for her small room, told me that she had never received a contract and that the agents carried out inspections without notice, using screwdrivers to get into locked rooms. The previous occupant had, she claimed, been evicted after agents arrived in her room and demanded she pay more rent than agreed.
A notice taped to the wall of a room next to her own stated it would be considered “abandoned” unless the occupant got in touch with the “host” within 24 hours. The five sharers were “fined” £60 when an inspection deemed the place untidy.
Last month, Lifestyle Club LSC was itself fined £22,299 by magistrates for breaching a statutory requirement to provide Camden council with details of the property management and the tenancy contracts for one of the raided properties and for a second flat in the borough.
Tiina Lehtla, the 30-year-old Lithuanian who founded the company with £1 of capital in 2017, was fined £7,983 plus costs for the same offences. The owner of the raided flat was fined £6,223.
In his summing up, the judge accused the defendants of putting safety at risk to maximise revenue. “They did not apply for licences to avoid an inspection, which would have resulted in expense to bring the properties up to standard,” he said.
“The tenants were from abroad and the most in need. They were given ‘membership’ agreements instead of tenancy agreements to try and curtail their rights.
“The obstruction of the local authority by not returning the statutory notices was deliberate, and a commercial decision to try and frustrate the investigation by environmental health officers.”
The case was a small victory for Camden council, which has brought 132 prosecutions against landlords and lettings agents in the past five years. It’s currently preparing legal action against LSC and the landlord of the second raided flat.
However, authorities across the land are fighting a losing battle. Camden’s attempt to prosecute LSC for operating the raided flats as an unlicensed and unsafe HMO fell through when only one tenant was willing to testify in court.
Companies found to have breached the law often resurface under a different name or with a different director, and some directors register multiple companies to avoid detection.
There are four Lifestyle Club companies registered with almost identical names and three different directors. Neighbouring Islington council is bringing charges of fraudulent trading against one, Lifestyle Club Ltd, which, before it ceased trading this year, operated from the same address as Lifestyle Club LSC but with a different director.
Abuses are on the rise as landlords and agents profit from those shut out of an overpriced property market. Typically, tenants are lured by photos of an attractive, affordable room on social media platforms and pressured to sign up before it vanishes, only to find the actual room is greatly inferior.
A former sales agent of Lifestyle Club LSC, who wishes to remain anonymous, has told the Observer how new recruits were instructed to sign up tenants before they’d had a chance to approve the accommodation. Lower-quality rooms were reserved for tenants from overseas, she says, and certain nationalities and profiles were banned.
Workers at rogue lettings agencies may be similarly exploited in order to pressure prospective tenants. LSC’s contractor’s contract, seen by the Observer , includes a raft of “fines” levied on self-employed agents who fail to meet specified targets and timescales aimed at hustling uninitiated young tenants – the contract excludes anyone over 35 – into hard-to-let rooms as fast as possible.
Agents are charged £50 per unlet room if they fail to meet their monthly quota of 15 and the same sum if they sign up a tenant who proves unreliable, “out of profile” or “complicated”. Further charges are levied on those who omit to give an hour’s notice if an “absolute emergency” prevents them working, or who check in for work late on the company’s online registration system. LSC declined to comment.
Cash-strapped local authorities, who try to crack down on rogue agents, had their hand strengthened by the Housing and Planning Act 2016. It allows them to impose civil penalties of up to £30,000 and to seek banning orders against landlords and agents who break the rules. Councils and tenants can reclaim rent paid if a lettings agent breaches the law.
The problem is, councils can only take action once crimes have been committed because, while lettings agents in Scotland and Wales are regulated, those in England do not have to have a qualification or a licence, which means anyone can set up in business.
LSC and Lehtla have been placed on the Rogue Landlord and Agent Checker set up by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and the LSC website has disappeared.
Councillor Meric Apak, cabinet member for better homes at Camden council, pledges that rogue operators will be pursued. “Landlords and lettings agents need to play by the rules and ensure if they are running an HMO it is properly licensed,” he says.

Put the word out: Chiswick may be Britain’s most literary location | Books,www.theguardian.com,Vanessa Thorpe,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/07/chiswick-literature-writers-festival,"London suburb names former residents from Betjeman and Burgess to Thackeray and Yeats among its 250 writers. Bath, Edinburgh and the Lake District are each deeply steeped in literary history and are justly proud, while Stratford-upon-Avon could claim to being the single most important literary destination in Britain. But now there is an unlikely new contender. The largely well-heeled London suburb of Chiswick is claiming that a succession of literary residents makes it the top writerly neighbourhood in the country.
Among Chiswick’s line-up, now set out for inspection on a literary timeline , are two winners of the Nobel prize in literature, one Booker prize winner, two Oscar winners and a poet laureate. With the tally of local writers now reaching 250, what started as a Twitter boast is gaining ground. And this weekend, as Chiswick prepares for its literary festival , a challenge has gone out to other suburbs, towns and villages: can you beat Chiswick?
Claimed authors include Nobel laureate Harold Pinter, who wrote The Caretaker in Chiswick; John Osborne, who submitted the manuscript of Look Back In Anger from his Chiswick houseboat; and William Makepeace Thackeray, who set the opening chapter of Vanity Fair in Chiswick Mall, where he went to school. Other residents were the 18th-century satirist Alexander Pope, the Irish poet WB Yeats, the second Nobel laureate on the list, the novelist EM Forster, Father Brown’s creator GK Chesterton, Patrick Hamilton, author of Hangover Square, Dame Iris Murdoch, JG Ballard, Anthony Burgess, Nancy Mitford, Sir John Betjeman, Alain-Fournier and playwright Sir Arthur Wing Pinero. So, with literary names dating back to the 17th century and including the designer and poet William Morris, the original Twitter claim for Chiswick made by Val Bott, a former chairman of the William Hogarth Trust, looks hard to beat.
Qualifications for inclusion are quite broad, with singer Ian Dury and sportsman Daley Thompson making the grade along with the satirist William Hogarth – but all are bona fide according to the director of the Chiswick Book Festival, Torin Douglas. “I knew there were distinguished writers with W4 connections, and famous residents who had written their memoirs, as well as less well-known authors, poets and dramatists. But I never suspected we’d find 250 – or that so many of them would be quite so distinguished.”
Yet there are other likely British candidates for the title. For example, elsewhere in the capital, Hampstead and Highgate may vie with Chiswick for its long history of literary associations, from John Keats to John Le Carré.

Why is the front one so small?
Now that is an interesting question. Basically these gears are designed to dispense with any need for a front derailleur, that means you only need one gear lever on the handlebars. The advantage of that is the gear mechanism is a bit simpler i.e. only one gear control cable and no change mechanism by the pedals to get gunged up and a saving a small amount of weight with only one gear wheel at the pedals.
But to get a reasonable range of gears (i.e. for elderly bikers like me) you then need a much larger set of gear wheels on the back wheel and just one smaller wheel at the front, you also need a derailleur mechanism at the back that can cope with those larger wheels. But even then you still end up with a narrower range of gears, I find the range does not give me enough flexibility to get up the steepest hills or at the other end pedal comfortably fast going down hill.
Provided you keep the 'old fashioned' gear set clean and maintained I have never really had any problem with the front derailleur and the weight saving overall from dispensing with it is at best equal to not drinking an extra cup of tea at breakfast. My view is these gears are nothing more than a marketing ploy to flog bikes."

Bring on no deal I say, the sooner the better we are out this corrupt organisation the better."

If an extension is granted, it is more likely to be at the request of Ireland than in the hope that the UK might regain its senses. UK politics is paralysed because neither May nor Corbyn nor the bulk of their MPs are willing to risk splitting their parties. It suits both leaders for the EU27 to take charge."

The older voters who voted to leave don't forget, overwhelmingly voted us in originally. What changed? The EEC turned into the EU which none had a chance to vote on. It just happened. The real question is and always has been: Can the EU reform?"
