Trump critic is favorite to become Australian prime minister,www.foxnews.com,ROD McGUIRK,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-critic-is-favorite-to-become-australian-prime-minister,"Australia Published 9 hours ago Last Update 8 hours ago Trump critic is favorite to become Australian prime minister By ROD McGUIRK | Associated Press Facebook Twitter Flipboard Print Email CANBERRA, Australia – If Australian opposition leader Bill Shorten becomes prime minister and visits the U.S., he can expect questions about a radio interview he gave three years ago in which he said some of then-presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump&apos;s views were ""barking mad.""
Trump seemed a long shot for the White House when Shorten gave the interview on May 27, 2016, during Australia&apos;s last election campaign.
And Shorten, who leads the center-left Labor Party, seemed a long shot to become Australia&apos;s prime minister.
He was trying to become the first Australian opposition leader to oust a prime minister after a single three-year term since 1931, when the Great Depression helped scuttle a Labor government.
But Shorten came closer than many had expected.
Conservative Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull scraped back into power with a single-seat majority in the House of Representatives, where parties need a majority of seats to form a government. Turnbull&apos;s conservative coalition had lost 14 lawmakers.
Turnbull pounced on Shorten&apos;s swipe at Trump as evidence that the Labor leader wasn&apos;t fit to lead Australia.
Turnbull accused Shorten of potentially offending Australia&apos;s most important strategic ally by breaking a long-standing Australian convention of avoiding taking sides in U.S. political contests.
Shorten had told a Darwin radio station that a Trump administration was among ""the sort of scenarios you hope don&apos;t emerge.""
""I think Donald Trump&apos;s views are just barking mad on some issues,"" Shorten said.
""America&apos;s a great friend of Australia; whoever they dish up we&apos;ll work with, but wow, Trump&apos;s sort of — it&apos;s sort of the ultimate victory of celebrity politics,"" he said.
Shorten described Trump&apos;s popularity as the ""ultimate protest vote,"" and warned that Australia should pursue policies of fairness and equality.
The political landscapes in Australia and the United States have transformed since 2016.
Shorten&apos;s party goes into the 2019 election campaign as a firm favorite. His party has led the conservative coalition in most opinion polls in the last three years.
Turnbull was replaced by senior minister Scott Morrison in a revolt by ruling Liberal Party lawmakers at least partly because of the government&apos;s poor performance in opinion polls.
The government lost two lawmakers and its majority in continuing blood-letting from the leadership change.
Despite Labor&apos;s dominance in the polls, Shorten&apos;s personal popularity has remained relatively low. But Australia&apos;s system of compulsory voting means Shorten&apos;s lack of charisma is not the political handicap it might be in U.S politics.
Because failing to vote is punished with a fine, voter turnout in Australia is always high even when the choices are not particularly attractive.
While there are Labor lawmakers who are more popular with the Australian public, Shorten is a power broker who has enjoyed strong support within his party for the past six years of his leadership.
The government had depicted Shorten as a puppet of the labor unions that donate to Labor&apos;s campaign war chest.
The government has also portrayed Shorten as being reckless with policies that would harm the Australian economy.
Energy policy is as contentious as any in Australia, which is the world&apos;s biggest exporter of coal and liquid natural gas.
Labor wants to cut Australia&apos;s greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.
Australia committed in the Paris Agreement on climate change to reduce its emissions by 26 or 28 percent by 2030.
Shorten, 51, was first elected to Parliament in the same 2007 election that swept Labor to power for the first time in more than 11 years. Morrison entered Parliament in the same election.
Shorten has deep labor union roots. His father was a waterside laborer and union official, and his mother was a lawyer and university academic. He became involved in Labor politics as a student and was soon touted as a potential prime minister. He worked for less than two years as a lawyer before becoming a union official.
Shorten first came to national attention as national secretary of the Australian Workers Union in 2006 when the Beaconsfield gold mine collapse in Tasmania state killed one miner and left two trapped underground for two weeks.
His regular news conferences on behalf of the union representing the miners created a national profile before he entered Parliament the following year.
But as a party power broker, Shorten played a key role in deposing two prime ministers through internal government leadership ballots in the face of poor opinion polling during Labor&apos;s chaotic six years in office. His history of fickle loyalty in ousting leaders he once supported may come back to haunt him as he seeks to lead the country."
Meghan Markle’s ‘Suits’ father sends ‘blessings’ ahead of royal birth,www.foxnews.com,Ann Schmidt,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-suits-father-royal-birth-blessings,"Wendell Pierce, who co-starred alongside the Duchess of Sussex for six of her seven seasons on “Suits,” tweeted his good wishes to Markle on Monday. “It’s great to be living & working in London while the excitement builds around the Duchess of Sussex soon giving birth to her first child. Meghan I’m very happy for you. Blessings,” Pierce wrote, along with a picture of London&apos;s Tower Bridge.
The 55-year-old actor is in London, starring in Arthur Miller’s “ Death of a Salesman ,” which will open in May. He played Robert Zane, the father of Markle’s character, Rachel Zane, on the legal drama “Suits,” which Markle left in 2018 before she married Prince Harry.
Last summer, Pierce revealed he and Markle shared a special moment on the set of “Suits” before she left the show.
“We had a moment I cherish,” Pierce told the U.K.’s Telegraph . “I was sitting with Meghan in her wedding dress, as we waited for a setup [in the scene]. We were alone.”
“I said to her: ‘Your life is going to change. It’s going to be amazing but I want you to know that I’m your friend, and no matter where you are or what’s going on – if the fishbowl that you’re in ever starts getting to you – you can call me,’” Pierce shared.

Though the exact due date is unknown, Markle has told fans she’s expecting to give birth in late April.
A source close to the 37-year-old Duchess of Sussex recently told The Daily Mail that a home birth is Markle&apos;s ""favored choice,"" though the pair haven&apos;t ruled out a brief hospital stay, noting that she&apos;s at a higher risk of complications given her age. If she does opt to deliver at Frogmore Cottage, the British tabloid reports that she would be surrounded by a team of midwives.
The palace hasn&apos;t released any official details about Markle&apos;s delivery plans yet, but if she doesn&apos;t go forward with the home birth it&apos;s likely she&apos;ll head to St. Mary’s Hospital in London — following in the royal family&apos;s footsteps.

California seeks death penalty in 'Golden State Killer' case,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-seeks-death-penalty-in-golden-state-killer-case,"Email
Joseph James DeAngelo, suspected of being the Golden State Killer, talks with his attorney, Diane Howard, in Sacramento County Superior Court after prosecutors announced they will seek the death penalty if he is convicted in his case, Wednesday, April 10, 2019, in Sacramento, Calif. The announcement flies in the face of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who recently announced a moratorium on executions. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) SACRAMENTO, Calif. – California prosecutors announced Wednesday they will seek the death penalty if they convict the man suspected of being the notorious ""Golden State Killer"" who eluded capture for decades. The move comes less than a month after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a moratorium on executing any of the 737 inmates on the nation's largest death row. Newsom's reprieve lasts only so long as he is governor and does not prevent prosecutors from seeking nor judges and juries from imposing death sentences.
Prosecutors from four counties briefly announced their decision during a short court hearing for Joseph DeAngelo. He was arrested a year ago based on DNA evidence linking him to at least 13 murders and more than 50 rapes across California in the 1970s and '80s.
He stood expressionless in an orange jail uniform, staring forward from a courtroom cage, as prosecutors from Sacramento, Santa Barbara, Orange and Ventura spoke. Although prosecutors from six counties were in court for the four-minute hearing, charges in those four counties include the special circumstances that could merit execution for 12 of the 13 murders under California law.
His attorney, public defender Diane Howard, criticized seeking the death penalty against a 73-year-old man, saying in an email that the decision ""does not further justice and is wasteful.""
With a multicounty prosecution team including more than 30 people, she cited a Sacramento County estimate that the prosecution will cost taxpayers more than $20 million.
DeAngelo has yet to enter a plea and his trial is likely years away.
Prosecutors wouldn't comment after the hearing, but Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said several prosecutors and family members of murder victims planned a Thursday news conference to denounce Newsom's moratorium. An announcement from Spitzer's office said victims' families ""will share their stories of losing their loved ones and how the governor's moratorium has devastated their pursuit of justice.""
The serial killer would sneak into suburban homes at night, authorities said. If a couple was home, he would tie up the man, place dishes on his back and threaten to kill both victims if he heard the plates fall while he raped the woman.
""These are horrific crimes. Our sympathies are with the victims and families who have suffered at the hands of the Golden State Killer,"" Newsom spokesman Brian Ferguson said in a statement acknowledging that the governor's executive order does not affect the ability of local prosecutors to make charging decisions.
California has not executed anyone since 2006, but Newsom said he acted last month because 25 inmates have exhausted their appeals and court challenges to the state's new lethal injection process are potentially nearing their end. He endorsed a repeal of capital punishment but said he could not in good conscious allow executions to resume in the meantime knowing that some innocent inmates could die.
He also said he is exploring ways to commute death sentences, which would permanently end the chance of executions, though he cannot act without permission from the state Supreme Court in many cases.
""The death penalty does serve as a deterrent,"" Ron Harrington, older brother of Golden State Killer victim Patrick Harrington, said after witnessing Wednesday's announcement. ""Unfortunately now our governor has decided to interpose his own personal opinion regarding the death penalty.""
Newsom's announcement ""places decisions that local prosecutors make in a different light,"" said Death Penalty Information Center executive director Robert Dunham, whose organization has been critical of how the penalty is administered. Decisions should be made on the facts ""and not on their perception of gaining political points by opposing the governor.""
Voters narrowly supported capital punishment in 2012 and 2016, when they voted to speed up executions by shortening appeals.
Criminal Justice Legal Foundation legal director Kent Scheidegger said prosecutors' decision made sense despite Newsom's moratorium.
""It's a perfect example of a killer for whom anything less would not be justice,"" said Scheidegger, who is fighting in court to resume executions. ""I think it's entirely appropriate for DAs to continue seeking the death penalty in appropriate cases, because the actual execution will be well down the road and the governor's reprieve won't be in effect by then. Something else will have happened.""

Bush to the crowd, and asked him to meet him on stage. “Come here, George! This is the only Bush that likes me. This is the only one,” Trump called out. “Come here, I want to meet you!”
Bush is the oldest child of former Republican Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and the nephew of former President George W. Bush.

Trump said that Bush is a friend of his son, “and he’s a great guy.”
“Truly, this is the Bush that got it right,” the president said, as the two met on stage and chatted briefly. Bush, according to Trump, “is going far, he’s going places.”
While in Crosby, a city roughly 25 miles northeast of Houston, Trump signed two executive orders that he said will accelerate the approval of energy infrastructure projects in the U.S.

"Ted Cruz, Twitter executive spar over alleged censorship, shadowbanning of conservatives",www.foxnews.com,Samuel Chamberlain,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ted-cruz-twitter-executive-spar-over-alleged-censorship-shadowbanning-of-conservatives,"Cruz led off a hearing of the panel&apos;s subcommittee on the Constitution by saying that ""a great many people agree that the pattern, the anti-conservative bias and the pattern of censorship we&apos;re seeing from big tech is disturbing. The question of remedy is a more complicated one. ... It&apos;s a thorny legal question. It&apos;s a thorny policy question."" Rep. Devin Nunes takes Twitter to court, sues tech giant for $250 million ""By almost any measure,"" Cruz added later in his remarks, ""the giant tech companies today are larger and more powerful than Standard Oil was when it was broken up [in 1911]. They are larger and more powerful than AT&T when it was broken up [in 1982]. And if we have tech companies using the power of monopoly to sanction political speech, I think that raises real antitrust issues.""
Twitter Director of Public Policy and Philanthropy Carlos Monje Jr., who sat on a panel with Facebook Public Policy Director Neil Potts, bore the brunt of questioning from Cruz and his colleagues. In his testimony, Monje apologized to Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., for Twitter&apos;s decision in October 2017 to block one of her campaign ads, in which she claimed to have ""stopped the sale of baby body parts"" by Planned Parenthood.
""We made the wrong call,"" Monje said to Blackburn. ""We develop policies governing advertisements that run on Twitter that try to balance allowing our advertisers to promote messages with protecting individuals who did not ask to see that ad. I am sorry.""
Monje ran into more trouble when Hawley asked him about the suspension of recent high-profile accounts, including one for the recently released film ""Unplanned,"" about a Planned Parenthood clinic director-turned-anti-abortion activist.
""The individual who started the @UnplannedMovie account had previously been suspended for breaking our rules and as a result, our automated systems flagged that account and it was taken down for an hour,"" answered Monje, who attempted to shake off a follow-up from Hawley about whether the company would make its content review protocols public.
""You say now, you&apos;ve admitted that there is human involvement in these decisions, that there are, in fact, numerous people involved, there are protocols, but you won&apos;t make them public, is that right?"" Hawley asked.
""I told you why @UnplannedMovie was banned – was taken down for an hour,"" Monje shot back, "" and I&apos;ve told you why [conservative writer and radio host] Jesse Kelly was kicked off the platform, and if you want more details, you can ask him.""
Hawley then asked Monje if Twitter would commit to a ""third-party audit"" of ""potential bias"" on the platform, a question Monje declined to answer.
""This committee hearing again today shows that you’re anything but transparent, and you apparently have no interest in becoming transparent,"" Hawley said. ""This is a huge, huge problem, and I would hope for the sake of the customers you serve and the values you purport to represent, that you would change your behavior and to change your commitments to providing a neutral, unbiased platform for all users in this country.""
Cruz turned his attention to Monje again later in the hearing to ask about restricting the visibility of conservative personalities in search results, a practice sometimes called ""shadow banning."" Monje denied that Twitter engaged in the practice, but admitted that the company would ""downgrade"" users&apos; posts ""if we have signals that indicate that a person is being spammy, meaning they are using multiple accounts to do the same thing, if they are using automated activity, but we’re not 100 percent sure that they’re breaking our rules, if they’ve been abusive, then what we will do is make it harder for that content to be found.""
Trump calls out Facebook, Google and Twitter for being ‘on the side of the Radical Left Democrats’ ""When you downgrade a tweet, do you notify the person that you&apos;ve downgraded?"" asked Cruz.
""I&apos;d have to get back to you on that, sir,"" Monje answered.
""OK, I believe the answer is no, and if the answer is no, that as far as I can tell is indistinguishable from shadow banning,"" Cruz fired back. When Monje pointed out that a downgraded user&apos;s followers were still able to ""find what that person tweeted,"" the senator responded, ""But if it&apos;s downgraded so far fewer people see it, that is exactly what is being alleged on shadow banning.""
A representative from Google was also scheduled to appear at the hearing, but the committee rejected the company&apos;s proposal to send its head of conservative outreach Max Pappas, a former Cruz staffer. Cruz announced that he would hold a separate hearing focused solely on Google at a later date.

Folau's anti-gay post condemned as 'unacceptable',www.foxnews.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/folaus-anti-gay-post-condemned-as-unacceptable,"Australia Published 8 hours ago Folau's anti-gay post condemned as 'unacceptable' Associated Press Facebook Twitter Flipboard Print Email SYDNEY – The governing body of Australian rugby has condemned an anti-gay post by Wallabies fullback Israel Folau on social media, saying it is ""unacceptable"" and ""disrespectful.""
Folau, one of the sport&apos;s top players, published a message on his Instagram account that said ""drunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists, idolators. Hell awaits you.""
Rugby Australia said its integrity unit was looking into the matter, and an announcement was expected Thursday. Folau&apos;s comments come just five months before the start of the Rugby World Cup in Japan, where Folau is expected to be one of Australia leading players.
RA said ""the content within the post is unacceptable. It does not represent the values of the sport and is disrespectful to members of the rugby community.""
Folau was warned last year after making anti-gay comments on social media, but avoided any disciplinary action. He has publicly aired his anti-gay stance and opposition to same-sex marriage, with one previous message reading that God&apos;s plan for gay people was ""HELL ... Unless they repent of their sins and turn to God.""
Folau has played 73 matches for Australia. Last weekend while playing for the New South Wales Waratahs, Folau scored his 60th try, the most of any player in Super Rugby, breaking former New Zealand winger Doug Howlett&apos;s record which had stood for more than a decade.
Former England rugby international Joe Marler, who now plays for Harlequins in the England premiership, mocked Folau by posting two images of men kissing. Those posts received wide support on social media, with many sharing and liking the images.
Former Wales rugby star Gareth Thomas, who announced he was gay in 2009, said on Twitter that people should ""not be influenced"" by Folau&apos;s words and that Thomas had ""sympathy"" for Folau.
Britain-based LGBT charity Stonewall supported Rugby Australia&apos;s early criticism of Folau&apos;s post Wednesday.
""Folau&apos;s comments are just one example of how much work is still left to do to combat discrimination and the use of hateful language against lesbian, gay, bi and trans (gender) people,"" Kirsty Clarke, director of sport at Stonewall, said. ""It&apos;s important that Rugby Australia have stepped up to challenge Folau&apos;s abusive comments.""

'Game of Thrones' star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau says no one has guessed show's ending,www.foxnews.com,Ann Schmidt,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/game-of-thrones-nikolaj-coster-waldau-fan-theories,"Coster-Waldau appeared on “ Jimmy Kimmel Live ” Tuesday night to discuss the ending of the hit series. “I’ve never read anyone who got the whole thing,” he told the late night host . “And when I read it the first time, I was blown away.”
“I wrote Dan and David, the two creators, and I was like, ‘I really don’t know how you did it, but I can’t imagine a better way of ending the show,’” he added.
Though the 48-year-old Danish actor has been sworn to secrecy about the highly anticipated ending, Kimmel tried to gauge his reactions to some guesses.
However, as Kimmel ran through some of the theories, Coster-Waldau kept a neutral, if not occasionally confused, face.
To the first theory, that Jaime will kill his sister Cersei, Coster-Waldau responded: “That’s a theory,” adding: “It makes sense, though, if you think about it.”
Another theory suggested that Arya Stark would kill Cersei using Jaime’s face. Coster-Waldau reacted with appreciation. “That would be cool, wouldn’t it?” he said, smiling.
When Kimmel read the prediction that Jon Snow would become the Night King, Coster-Waldau just asked “How?”
As the list of theories went on, he continued to stay non-committal with a simple “yeah” or “okay.”
Coster-Waldau then referenced a theory he thought would come true -- which ended up being a joke about the Leeds United soccer team.
“There’s also this thing about a guy called Bielsa, which is a guy who comes and magically transforms this world for the good.”
Though Kimmel fell for the joke, Coster-Waldau eventually admitted it was a reference to Marcelo Bielsa, the manager of Leeds United.

Surveillance footage of the Feb. 23 incident released last week showed Ferri’s alleged actions, which investigators described as “bizarre, cruel and reckless behavior.”
The video shows Ferri allegedly stopped at a crosswalk in Oakland Park to allow a pedestrian to pass.
But, as the person crossed in front of Ferri, he allegedly “accelerated and turned in the direction of the victim.”
The incident left the pedestrian with a broken leg, according to the sheriff’s office.
Ferri, who “has a history of arrests in Broward County,” was hit with a slew of charges, including battery, violation of probation, and drug-related offenses.

Buttigieg surges to third place in new NH poll,www.foxnews.com,Paul Steinhauser,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/buttigieg-surges-to-third-place-in-new-nh-poll,"The 37-year old South Bend, Ind., mayor has the support of 10.7 percent of likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire, according to a Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll released Wednesday. Former Vice President Joe Biden – expected by many political observers to formally announce a White House bid in the coming weeks – topped the poll. Nearly 23 percent said if the primary were held today, they’d vote for Biden. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – who’s running a second straight time for the Democratic nomination – was second at 15.6 percent.
Sanders won the 2016 Democratic primary in the Granite State by 22 percentage points over eventual nominee Hillary Clinton.
Buttigieg, an Afghanistan War veteran who would be the nation’s first openly gay president, was next in line.
“The emerging dark horse in this race may be Pete Buttigieg, who has gone from a virtual unknown to vault to 11 percent support,” said Neil Levesque, the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College. “His emergence as a factor is driven by a 33-point increase in name recognition, almost all of it favorable.”
The survey indicated that the former vice president’s favorability among likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire dropped 10 percentage points, to a still strong 70 percent.
Biden’s well-publicized, affectionate brand of physical politics was thrust into the spotlight nearly two weeks ago, thanks to allegations from 2014 Nevada Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Lucy Flores. She said in an essay published in New York magazine that Biden made her feel ""uneasy, gross and confused"" at a campaign rally when she said he kissed her on the back of the head.

Gutfeld on the unintended victims of the opioid crackdown,www.foxnews.com,Greg Gutfeld,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gutfeld-on-the-unintended-victims-of-the-opioid-crackdown,"According to the article, in the wake of the opioid crackdown, the federal Centers for Disease Control says the painkillers should be a last resort for patients. As a result, doctors have greatly reduced prescriptions and insurers refused to pay for the drugs for patients with cancer or sickle cell anemia. And even when patients weren’t denied coverage, they had to jump through more hoops than dolphins at SeaWorld.
Now there&apos;s no denying we&apos;ve got an opioid problem. But you make it worse with broad strokes based on fear and misinformation.
For one: the problem isn&apos;t prescription opioids, but street fentanyl. The addiction rate for prescriptions is low; the overdoses from street drugs are not.
So broadly targeting the prescription side only harms cancer patients, as well as other people with chronic and acute pain. Meaning the lawful, not the lawless.
As the media frames this as an epidemic, what you get is the same old one-size-crushes-all reaction that smacks every fly with a hammer.
Should you punish lawful gun owners for the crimes of street gangs armed with illegal weapons? No, that would be a violation of your rights. So why suspend that logic here?
The problem with opioids is that they work. And the worst thing you can do is let the government transfer business to the drug dealer, who&apos;s more than happy to oblige.

Jennifer Lopez says Diddy apologized to Alex Rodriguez after questionable Instagram comment on sultry picture,www.foxnews.com,Julius Young,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-diddy-alex-rodriguez-apology,"“He wrote Alex after [commenting],” the “ World of Dance ” judge, 49, said on Power 105.1’s ""The Breakfast Club"" on Wednesday. “He was like, ‘I didn’t mean anything by it. I have nothing but respect for you guys. I’m so happy for you guys.’”
Diddy has since apologized for his comment on Lopez's Instagram picture. (Instagram)
Lopez noted that she didn’t harbor any hard feelings about Combs’ “OMG” comment, which was followed by a heart-eyes emoji and immediately spurred former New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez to leave his own loving message, writing “Lucky me” with a heart emoji. “We were together so many years ago. It’s just like – we were kids, you know?”
The “Hustlers” star also told the radio show that she wasn’t taken aback by Rodriguez’s reaction and loves that he speaks his mind so freely. “He doesn’t play. He’s a crazy Dominican,” she joked. “Do not disrespect that man.”

Diddy and Lopez dated from 1999 and into the new millennium before splitting in 2001. During their two-year stint, the pair garnered major headlines for their over-the-top romance and red carpet looks. In 2000, Lopez stole the show when she debuted an iconic Grammys look in a see-through green Versace dress with a deep plunging V-cut from her chest down to her navel.

The Denver Post reports the jury awarded the money to Carolyn O&apos;Neal on Wednesday, finding that Fremont County sheriff&apos;s deputies violated her right to privacy, used excessive force and retaliated against her.

Melissa Castro tries to force back tears as she talks about her husband, Jose Luis Ibarra Bucio, while joined by local religious leaders during a news conference at the offices of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), Wednesday, April 10, 2019, in Los Angeles. The family of the 27-year-old man who died after a short stint in a California immigration detention facility demanded answers Wednesday about what happened to him and the timing of his release. Melissa Castro said her husband, was released as his health deteriorated from a brain hemorrhage and while he was in a coma from which he never awoke. (AP Photo/Richard Vog)el LOS ANGELES – A 27-year-old man died in a California hospital after he suffered a brain hemorrhage while detained by U.S. immigration authorities, his wife said Wednesday, demanding to know what caused his injury and whether he received appropriate medical care in custody. Melissa Castro said she was called Feb. 8 by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official and told that her husband had a ""passing out episode"" while in the custody of detention officials in Adelanto, California, and had been taken to the hospital.
Castro, who had delivered the couple's baby five days earlier, said she found Jose Luis Ibarra Bucio in an intensive care unit and in a coma from which he never awoke.
Castro said she wants to know what happened to her husband, who was young and had no prior health problems. She said she heard from doctors that he had been airlifted from another hospital.
She said she also wants to know why ICE had him shackled to his hospital bed in a coma and signed papers releasing him from custody two weeks later.
""Why wait the two weeks to release him when the state of health was even worse?"" she asked in an interview with The Associated Press. ""I think it might be because at that point they saw that the likelihood of him surviving wasn't high at all.""
Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement that Ibarra was released for humanitarian reasons. Officials at ICE and detention facility operator The GEO Group declined to discuss his health condition.
Ibarra was held at the facility in Adelanto for about a week until he collapsed on his way to an immigration court hearing on Feb. 7, immigrant advocates said.
When he was released from custody, Castro said, she initially was hopeful that someday Ibarra might be able to meet his son. In addition, she said it was a relief to no longer have guards in his hospital room or see him shackled.
But now, she questions why authorities chose to release him when they did. His condition worsened and he died March 21 after the family removed life support.
It was at least the second time in two years that an immigrant detained at the privately run facility in Adelanto has fallen into a coma and been released.
Immigrant advocates have noted that releasing severely ill detainees means U.S. authorities aren't subject to the same level of oversight as when an immigrant dies in custody.
Ibarra — who came to the United States from Mexico as a young child and grew up in Southern California — was arrested in 2017 after fleeing traffic police, Castro said.
She said he told her that he hadn't pulled over out of fear he could face deportation — though at that time he had permission to stay in the country under a President Barack Obama-era program for immigrants without legal status who were brought to the country as children.
Ibarra was convicted last year of evading or attempting to evade police while driving recklessly and sentenced to a year and four months, according to California's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
He was released from prison in January and taken into immigration custody.
Ibarra, a truck driver, married Castro two years ago. She is a U.S. citizen, but they had not filed papers to sponsor him to stay in the country and knew he might wind up in immigration custody after prison since his papers under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program had since expired, Castro said.
When her husband first got to detention, he called and told her that he'd wait as long as it took if he could remain in the country with her and their soon-to-be-born son, Castro said.
A week later, she said he sounded frustrated on the phone and wanted to see how quickly he could get out, she said.
He had an immigration court hearing scheduled for Feb. 7 and said he would call her afterward, but never did.
Castro said she got nervous and checked ICE's website and noticed her husband was still listed in custody but no longer at Adelanto.
Now, she and Castro's sister say they are grieving and dismayed that Ibarra will never meet his son.
""We are not the first family this has happened to, but we would like to be the last one,"" sister Lucian Ibarra told reporters in Spanish. Trending in US"

Former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig's lawyers reportedly said Wednesday that said Craig is expected to be charged. Greg Craig, who formerly served as counsel to the Obama White House , is expected to be charged with foreign lobbying violations, his lawyers reportedly said Wednesday. The case against Craig stemmed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe, centering around the lobbying work he performed in 2012 for the Russian-backed president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, while Craig was a partner at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.
SENIOR OBAMA CYBER OFFICIAL LOBBYING FOR CHINA
Craig allegedly never registered as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, which requires lobbyists to declare publicly if they represent foreign leaders, governments or their political parties.
His attorneys on Wednesday night told The Associated Press in a statement that the ""government's stubborn insistence on prosecuting Mr. Craig is a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion.""
FARA violations were only rarely prosecuted until Mueller took aim at Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, for his lobbying work in Ukraine.

There is no indication that Craig improperly colluded with a foreign government while he was serving in any official capacity. Craig worked as White House Counsel from 2009 to 2010 and previously worked in the Clinton administration on impeachment matters.
Craig also represented John Hinckley, Jr., the man who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981, according to The New York Times . Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity.

The HGTV show, which is set to debut in September, will document the renovation of the interior of the North Hollywood house used in exterior shots on “The Brady Bunch.” Each cast member was assigned a specific room in the house to remodel with the help of other HGTV stars such as the “Property Brothers.”
“One of the nice things about the show will be the sentimentality of it, the nostalgia,” Barry Williams, who starred as Greg on the ABC series, said. “Because when we’re going in the rooms, we’re reflecting on what happened and the scenes that we played.”

The news came a day after Mnuchin faced off in a contentious exchange on the issue with the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, California Rep. Maxine Waters. Mnuchin, who testified for more than three hours, said he would rethink whether to reappear before the committee, based on Waters' behavior.
In a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., who asked for Trump's returns a week ago , Mnuchin said Treasury would consult with the Justice Department and further review the request.

""The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically-motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power,"" Mnuchin wrote.
He said Treasury respects lawmakers' oversight duties, and would make sure taxpayer protections were ""scrupulously observed, consistent with my statutory responsibilities.""
Earlier Wednesday, Trump, who has broken with decades of presidential tradition by not releasing his returns, told reporters he wouldn't do so while he's under IRS audit. He said much the same thing last week.

""I would love to give them, but I'm not going to do it while I'm under audit.""
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News on Sunday that Democrats would ""never"" see Trump's returns.
The IRS says there's no rule against subjects of an audit releasing their tax filings.
The brouhaha comes as several other Democrat presidential contenders have vowed to release their returns or have already done so. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts r eleased her 2018 tax returns on Wednesday , showing she and her husband earned nearly $1 million last year.
And Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., announced Tuesday that he'll release 10 years of tax returns on Monday -- filings expected to show that the self-declared Democratic socialist made millions from book sales.
Trump's position has long been that he is under audit and therefore unable to divulge his returns. But in recent weeks, he has added to the argument, saying publicly and privately that the American people elected him without seeing his taxes and would do so again.
""Remember, I got elected last time — the same exact issue,"" Trump said, echoing Mulvaney's remarks in his ""Fox News Sunday"" interview. ""Frankly, the people don't care.""
The president has told those close to him that the attempt to get his returns represented an assault on his privacy and a further example of the Democratic-led ""witch hunt.""
Trump has repeatedly asked aides about the status of the House request and has inquired about the ""loyalty"" of the top officials at the IRS, according to one outside adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. ""Frankly, the people don't care."" — President Trump
Democrats didn't expect the department to comply, but they haven't sketched out their next steps. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., speaking before Mnuchin's response was delivered, said it may take Neal a couple of days to issue his own response.
House Democrats are at a party retreat in the Virginia suburbs of Washington.
Neal has adopted a methodical approach to seeking Trump's returns. He has the option of eventually seeking to subpoena the records or go to court to get them, but it's not clear if he's prepared to ratchet up the confrontation.

Neal's initial letter didn't lay out any consequences for the IRS if it didn't comply, and a spokesman said a likely course would be a second, more insistent, letter.
""We intend to follow through with this,"" Neal said Wednesday. ""I'll let you know fast.""
The request for Trump's tax filings is but one of many oversight efforts launched by Democrats after taking back the House in last fall's midterms. Neal is relying on a 1920s-era law that says the IRS ""shall furnish"" any tax return requested by the chairmen of key House and Senate committees.

Mnuchin told lawmakers that his department will ""follow the law,"" but he hasn't shared the department's interpretation of the statute.
The White House did not respond to questions as to whether the president asked Mnuchin or the IRS head to intervene.
The president's outside attorney also did not respond to a request for comment.

I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” Barr told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing on Wednesday. ""I think spying did occur, yes. I think spying did occur. The question was whether it was adequately predicated. And I'm not suggesting it wasn't predicated. I need to explore that.”
NBC News’ Chuck Todd accused the attorney general of giving credence to a “conspiracy theory.”
“Using the word spying,” the “Meet the Press” moderator said, “plays into the president’s language and argument that the Russia investigation to him is just a witch hunt, and every time they’ve brought up this allegation, there has been zero factual basis for it. Every effort to perpetrate the spying conspiracy theory has been debunked.” Video
Todd continued, “It doesn’t matter what the truth is, does it? I mean, I hate to say this now, but that’s the whole point. It feels like that basically the attorney general gaslit the country.”
MSNBC legal analyst Nick Akerman claimed that Barr’s remarks were “all part of the White House’s cover-up” of the Mueller probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections. He also accused the attorney general of telling the White House what’s in the special counsel’s report.
WASHINGTON EXAMINER JOURNALIST: WHAT BARR SAID IS 'A FACT'
CNN anchor Anderson Cooper classified Barr’s use of the term “spying” as “uncharacteristically broad,” coming from someone who is usually “lawyerly and precise.” Cooper insisted that Barr had “fanned the flames” for President Trump and the GOP. His colleague Chris Cuomo said the spying terminology was “an insult to the men and women” who work for Barr and a “defamatory way to refer to surveillance.”
CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin added that Barr’s remarks were ”loaded” and “false” and declared that the “paranoid lunacy of the right wing” has now taken over the Department of Justice.

"Britain, EU agree to delay Brexit deadline until Oct. 31",www.foxnews.com,Samuel Chamberlain,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/britain-eu-agree-to-delay-brexit-deadline-until-oct-31,"Britain had been due to leave the EU on Friday, but May rushed to an emergency summit in Brussels to plead with her European counterparts to hold off on saying goodbye for a couple more months. The prime minister had asked for a delay only until June 30, but Tusk said in a tweet that she had agreed to a longer ""flexible"" extension, which provides for Britain to leave any time before Oct. 31 provided Parliament ratifies a divorce deal and passes accompanying legislation to ensure a smooth transition out of the EU. At a news conference late Wednesday, May said she wanted to leave the EU ""as soon as possible,"" and added that Brexit could still be accomplished before the end of June if lawmakers backed the withdrawal agreement she negotiated with EU leaders earlier this year.
Brexit fallout: UK prepares 10K riot police for potential unrest ""The timetable is clear,"" said May, who had said earlier in the day she hoped the deal could be ratified as soon as May 22, which would avoid the need for Britain to participate in elections for the European Parliament.
May spoke to the 27 EU leaders for just over an hour before they met for dinner without her to decide Britain&apos;s fate. In contrast to some testy recent summits, there were signs of warmth and even humor. May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were seen laughing over a tablet bearing an image showing the two of them speaking to their respective Parliaments on Wednesday wearing similar blue jackets.
Many leaders said they were inclined to grant a Brexit delay, though French President Emmanuel Macron had reservations after hearing May speak. An official in the French president&apos;s office said the British leader hadn&apos;t offered ""sufficient guarantees"" to justify a long extension.
British economy in a slump as a result of Brexit uncertainty Macron told reporters that he had agreed to the six-month extension ""to preserve the unity"" among the 27 member states and to give Britain ""more time to deliver a deal."" He added that it was ""up to Britons to be clear with themselves and their people"" in next month&apos;s European elections.
The withdrawal agreement already has been rejected three times by the House of Commons, forcing May to scramble to find common ground with the main opposition Labour Party. Labour has indicated it favored a softer Brexit than the government has proposed and wanted to retain a close economic relationship with the bloc. Those efforts had yet to achieve a breakthrough, though the two sides said they would resume discussions Thursday.
As Britain&apos;s departure date of March 29 approached with no resolution in sight, the EU gave Britain until Friday to approve a withdrawal plan, change course and seek a further delay to Brexit, or crash out of the EU with no deal to cushion the shock. Economists and business leaders have warned that a no-deal Brexit would lead to huge disruptions in trade and travel, with tariffs and customs checks triggering gridlock at British ports and possible shortages of goods.
May said last month that ""as prime minister"" she could not agree to let Britain stay in the EU beyond June 30. She also has promised to step down once Brexit is delivered. Many Conservative Party lawmakers have said they&apos;d like her to quit now and let a new leader take charge of the next stage of Brexit. But, they can&apos;t force her out until the end of the year after she survived a no-confidence vote in December.

Harry Kazianis: Trump summit with South Korea president could bring progress in North’s denuclearization,www.foxnews.com,Harry J.

Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane reacts. President Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in will meet Thursday at the White House to discuss efforts to convince North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to get rid of his nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and forge a lasting peace with the South and the United States. Accomplishing this won’t be easy, but it’s not impossible. Dealing with North Korea has been a foreign policy and military nightmare since Korea was split into two nations in 1948 – the communist North aligned with Russia and China, and the South aligned with the U.S.
In fact, we are still technically at war with the North. The Korean War, begun in 1950, ended in 1953 with an armistice rather than a peace treaty. Offering Kim a peace treaty as part of a deal on denuclearization could be one of several incentives to get him to give up his nation’s status as a nuclear power.
TRUMP TO MEET WITH SOUTH KOREA’S MOON IN APRIL, WHITE HOUSE SAYS
Tensions rose considerably between Washington and Pyongyang in the dark days of 2017 when Trump and Kim traded threats of military strikes. But since then the two leaders have met in two summits in a so-far unsuccessful effort to resolve their differences.
Having no diplomatic relations makes things harder, with simple messages taking days to travel between key policymakers in the U.S. and North Korea. Establishing diplomatic relations would be a big win for Kim – and could be another incentive for him to make major concessions on denuclearization.
The good news is that if President Trump is willing to take a small leap of faith, there is a clear path forward that could guarantee a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula and a real end to the Korean War, ensuring that the nuclear threats of the past remain in the history books. The good news is that if President Trump is willing to take a small leap of faith, there is a clear path forward that could guarantee a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula and a real end to the Korean War, ensuring that the nuclear threats of the past remain in the history books.
This is where South Korea’s President Moon can make a difference.
The Moon Miracle, or what many refer to as Seoul’s strategy to facilitate a détente between the U.S. and North Korea, has been transformative.
Moon played a key role in a historically successful Winter Olympics in South Korea last year, three inter-Korean summits, a comprehensive inter-Korean military de-escalation agreement along the Demilitarized Zone, and the normalization of dialogue between the two Koreas.
These successes have done much to ensure the dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang moves forward. In engineering them, Moon has put his own legacy in clear jeopardy, while weakening his own position back home. He will be judged either a great success or an enormous failure, depending on how the North responds to his overtures.
Now we will find out if Moon’s miracle can be truly be sustained. On Thursday he will try to ascertain where President Trump stands on several key issues that could determine the future of relations with North Korea.
First, Moon will seek to figure out if Trump is really committed to a concrete diplomatic negotiation with North Korea, or only willing to deal with the Kim regime if it will surrender its nuclear weapons before getting any relief from economic sanctions.
Next, Moon must find out who is the key decision-maker on Trump’s team when it comes to dealing with North Korea. It is clear that there is not unanimity among Trump’s advisers.
It will be important for Moon to know if National Security Adviser John Bolton – a hardliner on dealing with the North – is just trying to project an image of strength, or whether he is truly the man driving the Trump administration’s negotiation strategy.
If Bolton is in the driver’s seat he will most likely demand what amounts to North Korea’s complete nuclear capitulation for any sort of concessions. A demand like this will most likely result in Kim ending any sort of talks for the foreseeable future.
Assuming Bolton is not driving administration policy, Moon needs to know if Washington is committed to absolutely no sanctions relief until full denuclearization – something that could take a decade or more to achieve – or if there is some middle ground that could be found.
If there is a middle ground, here is where Moon can truly make a difference. Moon should propose a compromise deal to provide limited sanctions relief to the North.
Under such a deal, North Korea would be required to close all facilities at its Yongbyon nuclear complex under international supervision, including a delegation of U.S. nuclear experts. In return, Pyongyang would be granted a temporary suspension of select sanctions.
Some U.N. Security Council resolutions could be suspended and the two Koreas could be allowed to work together on one or two joint economic projects under such a deal. The relaxation of sanctions on specific inter-Korean economic projects could include the linking of railways and roads across the North-South border.
This limited sanctions relief would cost the U.S. very little and be a significant boost to Moon’s separate inter-Korean reconciliation initiative. And it could accelerate the prospects of a peace agreement on the Korean Peninsula.
This play on words – calling the action “a temporary suspension of select sanctions,” matters tremendously and could be the key to a compromise deal.
President Trump would be able to say that he is not dropping any sanctions, at least not formally. Also, the Trump administration could embrace the role of the reasonable adult in the room and offer the North Koreans enough flexibility to prove that its intentions towards peace and denuclearization are more than just talk.
This would allow Washington to grant Pyongyang a key concession while throwing the ball on North Korea’s side of the court to demonstrate its sincerity.
There is, however, one catch to this agreement. The U.S. would need to insist on a snapback provision for sanctions. This way, if the Kim regime does cheat, America and South Korea can reapply sanctions quickly.

This is a deal President Trump should embrace. Now that any immediate danger from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation has passed, Trump surely would love to change the media narrative and focus the American people’s gaze on something much more positive, especially with the 2020 elections right around the corner.
There is no bigger accomplishment that would allow Trump to claim a real legacy than helping bring real peace to the Korean Peninsula along with denuclearization.

Judge Andrew Napolitano: Who will see the full Mueller report?,www.foxnews.com,Andrew Napolitano,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/judge-andrew-napolitano-mueller-report,"As I write, Barr and his team are scrutinizing the Mueller report for legally required redactions. These include grand jury testimony about people not indicted -- referred to by lawyers as 6(e) materials -- as well as evidence that is classified, pertains to ongoing investigations or the revelation of which might harm national security. Mueller impaneled two grand juries, one in Washington, D.C. and the other in Arlington, Virginia. Together they indicted 37 people and entities accused of a variety of federal crimes. Most of those indicted are Russian agents in Russia who have been charged with computer hacking and related crimes in an effort to affect the 2016 presidential election. They will never be tried.
Some of the Americans indicted have pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents, such as retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos told me personally that even though he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, he did not, in fact, lie to them. Do the innocent ever plead guilty? Answer: Yes, they do.
This is a dirty little secret of the American justice system. Often, the cost of defending oneself is so burdensome that a guilty plea -- if not disabling to one&apos;s profession, such as law or medicine -- offers a tolerable and far less expensive way out. In my years as a trial judge in New Jersey, I accepted more than 1,000 guilty pleas. I always asked if the defendant was truly guilty, and the defendants always replied affirmatively. But the guilt of those pleading guilty is often a legal fiction, practiced every day in courthouses around the United States.
Paul Manafort was convicted of financial crimes by a jury and also pleaded guilty to other financial crimes. Roger Stone was indicted and accused of lying to Congress and is scheduled for trial in the fall. Dr. Jerome Corsi, who was interrogated extensively by Mueller&apos;s FBI agents, was threatened with indictment, revealed the threat and was never indicted.
I recount this thumbnail history to remind readers that Mueller delved into many more areas than President Donald Trump&apos;s behavior. Knowing federal prosecutors as I do, I am comfortable suggesting that more people were swept up into this investigation and were not charged with any crimes. Under the law, Barr and his team must be told of all this, but the public has no right to know who these folks are or what they discussed with the FBI.
Now back to Barr&apos;s four-page assessment. The Department of Justice is in the business of investigating crimes and determining if it has sufficient, lawfully acquired evidence to prosecute and to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The DOJ is not in the business of exoneration. In fact, the word ""exoneration"" and the concept appear nowhere in the U.S. Code or the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. To offer, as Barr has in his letter, that Mueller exonerated Trump is to offer nonsense. Jay Sekulow, one of Trump&apos;s personal lawyers, acknowledged as much publicly last weekend.
In his letter, Barr did not write that Mueller found no evidence of a conspiracy. Conspiracy is an agreement to commit a crime, whether or not that crime is actually committed. This is what the media and the president have been calling collusion. ""Collusion"" also does not appear in the U.S. Code and does not describe criminal behavior. It was insinuated into our vocabulary by Trump&apos;s television lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, after a successful but deceptive word game campaign.
As well, Barr did not write that Mueller found no evidence of obstruction of justice. Obstruction is not a crime that requires completion, only a serious attempt. If I tackle you on your way into a courthouse where you plan to testify against me, so as to impede your testimony, then I have committed obstruction, even if you subsequently give the intended testimony.
The reason for my criticism of the no collusion and no obstruction bandwagon riders is because we know that Mueller must have found some evidence of conspiracy and some evidence of obstruction -- just not enough to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Barr tipped his hand to this when he wrote in his letter that the DOJ could not ""establish"" these crimes. That&apos;s lawyer-speak for ""could not prove them beyond a reasonable doubt.""
If Mueller had found no evidence whatsoever of conspiracy and obstruction, Barr would have said so in his letter. He didn&apos;t. So, will we see whatever evidence Mueller did find?
We also know that, according to some on the Mueller team, the flavor of whatever Mueller found did not come through in Barr&apos;s four-page letter, and some have voiced privately to the media their displeasure. This has caused the president to accuse Mueller&apos;s team of unlawful leaking. That is not necessarily so.
Voicing displeasure is one thing -- ""wait for the full report to come out and decide for yourself if the Attorney General fairly characterized it"" -- revealing 6(e) materials is another. The former is protected free speech. The latter could be career-ending.
Where does all this leave us? In the hands of Bill Barr. The House Judiciary Committee wants to see the evidence, which Barr will argue the law requires him to keep secret. Yet, did the president waive his privacy rights when he called for the public revelation of the full Mueller report? A federal judge will soon answer that question, as well as this one: With respect to the president, which is the higher value -- privacy or truth?

Man facing execution for pastor's sword-and-dagger slaying,www.foxnews.com,KIM CHANDLER,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-facing-execution-for-pastors-sword-and-dagger-slaying,"Christopher Lee Price, 46, is scheduled to receive a chemical injection Thursday evening for killing pastor Bill Lynn. The 57-year-old victim was slain during a Dec. 22, 1991, robbery while preparing Christmas gifts at his home. Prosecutors said Lynn was at his Fayette County home getting toys ready for his grandchildren when the power was cut. Lynn went outside to check the fuse box when he was killed, according to court filings.
Lynn&apos;s wife, Bessie Lynn, testified that she was in an upstairs bedroom watching television when she heard a noise. She said she looked out a window and saw a person dressed in black in a karate stance, holding a sword above her husband&apos;s head. Lynn, a minister at Natural Springs Church of Christ, had returned home with his wife from a church service before the slaying.
Bessie Lynn said she went outside to help her husband, but two men ordered her back in the house and demanded money and any jewelry and weapons they had. After being arrested, Price initially told police he had been involved in the robbery but said it was an accomplice that killed Bill Lynn. An autopsy showed that Lynn had been cut or stabbed more than 30 times.
After Lynn&apos;s murder conviction, a jury recommended a death sentence by a vote of 10-2.
A second man, Kevin Coleman, pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to life in prison.
Lawyers had attempted to overturn the death sentence on the grounds that his appointed defense lawyer was ineffective and failed to mount a robust defense, including failing to conduct a background investigation, during the penalty phase of the trial. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
In last-minute legal filings, attorneys for Price have sought to stay execution plans over Price&apos;s request to be put to death by nitrogen hypoxia. His attorneys argued that the state was planning to execute Price with a drug combination that has been linked to problematic executions while agreeing to execute other inmates by use of nitrogen hypoxia.
Although Alabama authorized nitrogen as an execution method last year, it has not developed a procedure for using it or carried out a death penalty using the gas.
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday declined to halt Thursday&apos;s execution. The appellate judges said Price did not have an equal protection claim because all death row inmates had an opportunity to select nitrogen as their preferred execution method after the law was approved, but that Price missed the deadline for making a selection.
According to the state, 48 of the more than 170 inmates on death row have elected to be put to death by nitrogen hypoxia. As states have had trouble obtaining lethal injection drugs, Alabama in 2018 authorized nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative for carry out death sentences. Proponents of the change argued nitrogen would be readily available and hypoxia would be a painless way to die.
If carried out, the execution would be Alabama&apos;s second this year.
In February, Alabama executed inmate Dominique Ray for the 1995 murder of a 15-year-old girl.

Roderick Brown Jr. was fired in 2017 in Forrest City, Arkansas, because an investigation showed he tried to extort sex from women while on duty, the television station reported. He's now a police sergeant in the north Mississippi town of Holly Springs.
A May 2017 termination letter from Forrest City says body camera recordings supported a woman's claim that Brown sought sex in exchange for leniency when he arrested her. The letter says two other women earlier accused Brown of inappropriate comments and sexual advances while on duty in exchange for help.
Brown was found to have violated department policies including intimidation, harassment and compromising criminal cases.
He surrendered his law enforcement certification in Arkansas in October after Forrest City asked for a decertification hearing.
Holly Springs officials and Brown referred requests for comment to the city's attorney, who hasn't responded.
Mississippi's Board on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Training says it's reviewing Brown's certification.
Brown previously worked as a police officer in the Arkansas towns of Marianna and Gallaway. He resigned as interim chief in Gallaway after an ""employee warning"" about overtime management.
It's unclear when Brown went to work in Holly Springs, but a Facebook post shows he was promoted to sergeant in April 2018.

U.S. President Donald Trump's move to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights has caused concern in Lebanon over its claim to the disputed Chebaa Farms and adjacent Kfar Chouba hills, which Israel occupied alongside the Golan in 1967.(AP Photo/Hussein Malla) CHEBAA, Lebanon – Akram Kanaan looked toward an Israeli military position on a snow-capped mountain that overlooks the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon, pointing toward the scenic area captured by Israel more than five decades ago. No matter how long it takes, he says, it will eventually return to Lebanon's sovereignty. Like many others in this area where the borders of Lebanon, Syria and Israel meet, Kanaan — a member of Chebaa's municipal council — is angry about President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, seized from Syria in 1967 and annexed in 1981. The American president has no right to give Israel lands that belong to Syria and Lebanon, he says.
""These are Arab territories that will be liberated sooner or later the way the south was liberated,"" said Kanaan standing near Chebaa's main school as its buses left the compound at the end of a school day.
Trump's move last month has caused concern among Lebanese officials that it would mean also recognizing the occupied Chebaa Farms and nearby Kfar Chouba hills, captured along with the Golan, as Israeli territory. Lebanese President Michel Aoun said the U.S. recognition undermines Lebanon's claim to the territory.
The origin of the dispute over ownership of the Chebaa farms dates back to the French colonial period, when France drew maps of the area without officially demarcating the border.
Following an 18-year occupation, Israel withdrew from south Lebanon in 2000, but held on to the farms. Hezbollah claimed the withdrawal to be incomplete and demanded, along with the Lebanese government, that Israel withdraws. Israel rejected the demands, saying the land was Syrian when it was captured in 1967. Syria has held an ambiguous position and generally refuses to demarcate the border before Israel withdraws from the Golan.
The U.N., which doesn't recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan, has said Lebanon's claim is to be settled along with the Golan's fate.
The territory is controversial, even among Lebanese themselves.
Although most Lebanese agree that the Chebaa Farms and Kfar Chouba hills are part of their country, anti-Syrian politicians have suggested it serves as a pretext for Hezbollah to hang on to its weapons and have called for the demarcation of the Lebanon-Syria border, a demand repeated by Prime Minister Saad Hariri on Wednesday even as he said the territory is Lebanese.
Politicians allied with the Syrian government say there is no need for such demarcation.
The area this week looked more like a tourist attraction, albeit deserted, rather than a front line, with rivers and springs flowing, birds chirping and shepherds leading their herds in the mostly green area amid clear weather.
According to Kanaan, the total size of the Lebanese area still occupied by Israel since June 1967 is about 250 square kilometers (96 square miles) or about 2.5% of Lebanon's total territories.
Kanaan says the occupied area is owned by Lebanese citizens and that many of them have documents proving their ownership registered in the Lebanese coastal city of Sidon, the provincial capital of south Lebanon.
Arab countries have unanimously rejected the U.S. recognition of Israeli control over the Golan, calling the Trump administration's policies unfairly biased toward Israel.
On the edge of Chebaa, shepherds were seen taking their herds of sheep and goats near a fence built by Israel. About every 100 meters (109 yards) white and blue barrels marked the so-called blue line, or the border that the U.N. drew after Israel's withdrawal in 2000.
The area has been calm since August 2006 after a U.N. Security Council resolution ended a 34-day war between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah group.
Soldiers at Lebanese army checkpoints on roads leading to Chebaa and Kfar Chouba checked the identity cards of people visiting the area to make sure no strangers enter. White U.N. vehicles with light blue flags could be seen along the fence that marks the border.
Near al-Naqar lake, three U.N. peacekeepers stood outside their armored personnel carrier keeping an eye on any suspicious move. Next to them stood a giant poster with a picture of late Egyptian President Gamal Abdul-Nasser and one of his famous quotes that reads: ""What was taken by force can only be regained by force.""
Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for the U.N. force in southern Lebanon known as UNIFIL, said the issue of Chebaa is one that is ""discussed in New York at U.N. headquarters and not part of our mandate. Nevertheless, the position of member states is not necessarily the position of the United Nations,"" Tenenti said when asked about Trump's decision.
""Nothing has changed, and we are continuing with our work in the south of Lebanon, to monitor the cessation of hostilities and to work closely with the Lebanese army,"" he said.
In nearby Kfar Chouba, shops were open in its main square where a group of people gathered at the main bakery, while others bought freshly picked vegetables and fruits.
""With deep regret, this guy who is called Trump who is the president of the United States of America, the most important country in the world, is acting like a thug,"" said grocer Riad Khalifeh who was 23 when Israeli forces captured the hills overlooking his hometown of Kfar Chouba in 1967.
""Who gave you the right to give a land that belongs to me or to Palestine or to Syria to an enemy that is occupying it?"" Khalifeh asked. Trending in World"

Thousands of Amazon workers listen to recordings from Alexa: reports,www.foxnews.com,Brie Stimson,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/thousands-of-amazon-workers-listening-to-alexa-recordings-hear-personal-information-even-potential-crimes-report,"Email
Amazon Echo (Business Wire) Alexa is like having your own personal assistant that never asks for a raise. The problem is she’s always listening — and so are thousands of Amazon workers, according to a report. Teams stationed around the world listen to and transcribe recordings, then send them back into the Echo’s software to erase the gaps in Alexa’s ability to understand speech, a report from Bloomberg said.
AMAZON ALEXA ADDS DETAILED NEWS READING OPTION
Sometimes the employees can even hear chatter in the background while Alexa is on, but they are not authorized to speak about their work, Bloomberg reported.
The workers, who range from contract to full-time employees, reportedly have signed nondisclosure agreements and listen to up to 1,000 audio clips per nine-hour shifts.
Although Amazon reportedly has procedures in place for when potential criminal conduct is heard, two workers in Romania told Bloomberg that they were told it isn’t Amazon’s job to interfere. In other cases, the workers said they use internal chat rooms to share recordings they find amusing.
When workers come across a background conversation about personal information – like bank details – they are supposed to make the audio file as “critical data” and move on, according to Bloomberg.
“We take the security and privacy of our customers’ personal information seriously. We only annotate an extremely small number of interactions from a random set of customers in order to improve the customer experience,"" an Amazon spokesperson told Fox News in a written statement. ""For example, this information helps us train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems, so Alexa can better understand your requests, and ensure the service works well for everyone.""
Alexa users can disable their voice recordings for developing new features.
Apple’s Siri and Google Assistant also have human workers that listen to snippets of audio, but the companies reported to Bloomberg that the recordings aren't linked to personally identifying information.

“We have strict technical and operational safeguards, and have a zero tolerance policy for the abuse of our system. Employees do not have direct access to information that can identify the person or account as part of this workflow.

Eyewitnesses in the Sudanese capital say the military has deployed at key sites in the city to secure several installations ahead of an army announcement and amid reports of a coup to replace the country&apos;s longtime president, Omar al-Bashir.
The situation in Khartoum remains fluid and it wasn&apos;t immediately possible to confirm that al-Bashir is being ousted.
The witnesses told The Associated Press that military armored vehicles and tanks have been parked in the streets and near bridges over the Nile River as of Thursday morning, as well as in the vicinity of the military headquarters, where thousands are anxiously waiting for the army statement.
The compound has been the scene of a large anti-government sit-in since last Saturday calling for al-Bashir&apos;s ouster. The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals.

Sudan&apos;s state TV says the country&apos;s armed forces will deliver an ""important statement"" and are asking the nation to ""wait for it.""
The announcement raised expectations the statement Thursday could address nearly four months of anti-government protests demanding that longtime President Omar al-Bashir step down and could be a sign that he is relinquishing power.
Organizers of the protests urged masses to converge and join an ongoing sit-in that has been underway in the capital, Khartoum, since the weekend.
Sudanese radio is playing military marches ahead of the announcement.
The TV s says there&apos;ll be an ""important statement from the armed forces after a while, wait for it.""
It comes after clashes between Sudanese security forces and protesters, after an attempt to break the sit-in, leaving 22 dead since Saturday.

(Photo By Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post via Getty Images) A Denver police officer will serve a 10-day suspension after he was reportedly caught inside a strip club while on duty last year. Officer Shederick Dobbin will begin serving his suspension on April 21 and will be docked two days pay. Dobbin was supposed to be working his 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift on Nov. 5, 2018, but left without permission an hour early to go to PT’s Showclub in nearby Lakewood, Fox affiliate KMGH-TV reported.

Investigators began looking into Dobbin when one of the club’s dancers turned up dead. He is not suspected in her death, but authorities discovered he looked up her criminal history and that of two of her associates, according to the station .

Tammy Bruce: The fraying edges of universal health care,www.foxnews.com,Tammy Bruce,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tammy-bruce-universal-health-care,"The Guardian reported, “Patients who are losing their sight are being forced to wait for months before having eye cataracts removed because of NHS cost-cutting. … The NHS has imposed restrictions on patients’ access to cataract surgery in more than half of England. … The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) condemned the rationing as shocking. It warned that not treating people with cloudy vision risks them falling and breaking bones, thus costing the NHS more.” Last year, The New York Times reported some people in England were waiting for 12 hours to be seen in emergency rooms.
“Some doctors took to Twitter to vent their frustrations publicly. One complained of having to practice ‘battlefield medicine,’ while another apologized for the ‘3rd world conditions’ caused by overcrowding,” the newspaper reported.
This is what happens when “the government” is paying for health care — people become the budget. Inevitably, the individual becomes nothing more than a budget item to be deemed worthy … or not.
In England, rationing is established by NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), which determine which procedures have “value.” As an example, “Of the 195 NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in England, 104 now include cataract removal on their list of ‘procedures of limited clinical value,’ according to research by the Medical Technology Group.”
Many CCGs have determined hernia repair is no longer something patients can automatically have, while dozens have declared knee and hip replacements as also not necessarily possible, the Guardian said.
Why does a civilized Western country deliberately allow thousands of its citizens to go blind? Julie Wood, chief executive for NHS clinical commissioners, explained to the Times of London: “The NHS does not have unlimited resources. Ensuring patients get the best possible care against a backdrop of spiraling demands, competing priorities and increasing financial pressures is one of the biggest issues clinical commissioners face.”
For Democrats to continue to promote something we know will destroy lives is unconscionable. We have watched the disaster of nationalized health care in England unfold. But liberals can’t help themselves, and know the only way to guarantee massive government and control over our lives is to control our access to health care.
Health insurance, especially when completely controlled by the government, isn’t about who gets health care, it’s about who doesn’t. It is the ultimate in population control.
In February, more than 100 Democrats in the House of Representatives were very excited to reveal their “Medicare-for-all” legislation, but, of course, without a price tag.
“The bill, co-sponsored by just over 100 House Democrats, doesn’t include specific proposals for financing the new system, which analysts estimate would cost tens of trillions of dollars over a decade,” Politico reported.
“The proposal calls for a two-year transformation of Medicare into a universal single-payer system, eliminating nearly all private health plans. … ‘The state of our health care system is absolutely atrocious,’ [the lead sponsor, Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal,] told reporters … ‘We believe that the market is broken, and that is the core idea here — that we’re trying to fix it.’ “
It is broken, thanks to the very same people now insisting they’ll fix it. Democrats insisting that nationalized health care is the answer to their ObamaCare debacle is the equivalent of sending the Hindenburg to rescue the passengers of the Titanic. But what else would we expect from the “You can keep your doctor and policy” crowd as they lied to you about your premiums going down?
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice …
One patient in England, a construction worker, complained to The New York Times of his daily fresh NHS hell: “Patients have accused hospitals of putting them at risk. ‘I learned about the new set of deferrals from the news, but if I receive a notification, it will be the third time my operation is postponed,’ Graham Groves, a construction worker, said as he sat in a cafe at St. Mary’s Hospital. ‘This is a disgrace. We injure ourselves while working to pay our taxes, and the government just leaves us to suffer.’ “
Nationalized health care is a scourge only for the poor, middle-class and disenfranchised. The rich always have options. An important reminder comes courtesy of Rolling Stones’ frontman Mick Jagger. He went for a checkup prior to his upcoming tour, and doctors found a heart valve problem requiring immediate surgery. Did the famous British singer have his surgery in England? No, he traveled to New York for the lifesaving medical care.
CNS News reported on comments made by Chris Jagger, the singer’s brother, “Speaking with Sunday People magazine, Chris Jagger, 71, said, ‘Mick is doing OK. I spoke to him — he’s good. It just showed up on a scan so it could happen to anybody, you know. … With Mick it came on a checkup. I’ve had a few health issues. At least he has not got to wait in line for the NHS.’ “
Indeed. Too bad the construction workers, and all the not-rich-and-famous of England, still do.

That's not right. And we've got to act to stop,” Cruz told Bream.
Cruz led off Wednesday’s hearing of the panel's subcommittee on the Constitution by saying that ""a great many people agree that the pattern, the anti-conservative bias and the pattern of censorship we're seeing from big tech is disturbing.”
FLASHBACK: TRUMP SAYS 'TOO MANY VOICES ARE BEING DESTROYED' BY SOCIAL MEDIA CENSORSHIP
Bream mentioned that the social media platforms were private companies prompting Cruz to admit “the remedy is complicated” and bring up one possible solution.
Cruz explained that “you can't sue Twitter and Google and Facebook if they commit libel, if they commit slander” because they’re viewed as “neutral public forums.”
Cruz added, “Well they're now engaged as partisan left-wing political speakers have no reason on earth they should have a special immunity from liability that protects them in a way that nobody else does.”

“You don’t even want that to happen,” Winfrey warned everyone.
“Why would you say that?” Noah asked.
“You don’t even want that to happen,” she said. “You know, Gayle, my dearest friend, I thought she was actually serious. Like ‘I think you should do it. You should do it for the country.’ I said, ‘You don’t want that to happen because I have such a beautiful life! I have such a beautiful life! Why would I want to put myself in that?’”
“I know my path and my path isn’t that,” she continued. “But whenever I decide whoever I want to support, I will get behind that person.”
Winfrey sparked plenty of hope among the anti-Trump Resistance in January 2017 when she gave a widely-praised powerhouse speech at the Golden Globes just days before President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
During the “Between the Scenes” segment uploaded on YouTube, the billionaire philanthropist revealed that she is considering opening a second school following the 2007 opening of the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa, this time in the United States.

If that weren’t enough, the singer and dancer is slated to appear in Nickelodeon SlimFest , a family-friendly music festival taking place in Chicago on June 8th and June 9th. And somehow in between, Siwa managed to develop a close bond with Kim Kardashian and her 5-year-old daughter North West . Siwa spoke to Fox News about Kardashian contacting her out of nowhere, why she’s not in a hurry to grow up anytime soon and how her family manages to give her a normal upbringing despite fame.
Fox News: Kim Kardashian of all people contacted you about her daughter North West. What exactly happened?
JoJo Siwa: Yes. Kim posted something on Twitter that just said, ""LOL @ North&apos;s bow. She&apos;s obsessed with ..."" and she tagged me @itsjojosiwa. I was like, ""Oh my gosh! North West is a JoJo fan."" I was like this is everything. So, with Nickelodeon, I had a big gigantic package sent to Kim, and of course to North, of JoJo merchandise. She loved it.
She posted it on her Instagram story, and so I just messaged her on Instagram. I just responded to the story, and was like, ""Oh my gosh, love it. If you want me to surprise North, or if North ever wants to be in a video just let me know, and I would love to."" I gave her my number, and I was like just text me. She said, ""Awesome, I&apos;ll text you in the morning."" I was like, OK, sure, I&apos;ll go with it. And now we filmed something.
Fox News: You’ll be joining other celebrities for the Nickelodeon SlimeFest. Who are you looking forward to seeing the most, and why?
Siwa: There&apos;s going to be a lot of really good people there. There&apos;s going to be T-Pain , Bebe Rexha , and Pitbull . I think Pitbull, I love Pitbull. My dad loves Pitbull.
Fox News: Why is it important now more than ever to offer family-friendly programming?
Siwa: You know, I think there can be a lot of things on the Internet right now that say they’re family-friendly, and then they aren’t family-friendly. So, it&apos;s really important to me to make sure that everything that I put out there is family-friendly.
I think it&apos;s important because kids need to stay kids. Kids don&apos;t need to grow up as they think, maybe, they should. Or as they think they want to. You know, you only live your childhood once. You only live every age once. You only live your life once. I think that it&apos;s good for kids to stay kids, and for kids to stay young, and stay healthy. So, I try to help with that.
Fox News: Many 15-16-year-olds want to rebel and look older, but you don&apos;t. Why?
Siwa: I really have a strong look at life. I look at my life and I&apos;m like, “Where do I want to be in 10 years? Where do I want to be in 20 years? Where do I want to be in 40 years? Where do I want to be in 60 years? I see like OK, in 20 years I&apos;m going to be 35, what do I want to be doing?” But right now I&apos;m only 15, so let&apos;s stay 15. I&apos;ll just age as I grow, but right now I&apos;m just 15 and living my best life. I love rainbows. I love unicorns. I love sparkles, and I don&apos;t want to change any of that.
Fox News: How do your parents keep you grounded?
Siwa: My family is awesome. I love them so, so, so, so much. They keep me grounded really well. They keep me normal. You know, like at dinner, we&apos;ll play cards, and we&apos;ll just talk about life. We&apos;ll just have fun. We&apos;re just such a close family. Literally, my brother is probably my best friend. My mom is my best friend. My dad is my best friend. We&apos;ve just stayed the same. To them I&apos;m not some celebrity kid, I&apos;m not some famous kid. To them, I&apos;m just my brother’s little sister. I&apos;m my dad&apos;s little girl. I&apos;m my mom&apos;s little kid. I&apos;m just my family to them.
Fox News: How do you find that balance of constantly being on the road, but also being a normal kid?
Siwa: The thing with me is my whole life has been this. I&apos;ve either been working towards getting this since I was 2 years old or actually when I started this when I was 9 years old. So, as weird as it may seem, I&apos;m not normal. This is what I do. This is what I love to do.
I&apos;m a performer. I&apos;m here for this. So, performing, and rehearsing, and working hard, and singing, and the recording studio, and actually physically than being on stage that is my fun. That is what I get to do for fun. That is what I enjoy, and what I love to do. So, it&apos;s cool that, that is also my career. That is also what I&apos;m going to be doing for the rest of my life, hopefully, if everything goes good. Let&apos;s go good with it.
Fox News: How do you cope with bullies on social media?
Siwa: It can definitely be hard with bullies online. For me, I don&apos;t want to give the mean people the time. If I see a hate comment and right next to it is a nice comment I don&apos;t want to listen to that one hate comment, to those 10 out of a 100 hate comments. If I&apos;m not going to give the nice comments the time, why should I give the hate comments the time?
Fox News: What do you think the future holds for you?
Siwa: I think the future for me is, from what I see, it looks incredible. I think the future specifically for me just means getting bigger, and getting better, and getting stronger. I&apos;m so passionate about what I do, and I just see myself growing it explosively like no other. I&apos;m performing for audiences the sizes from 3,000 to some of them are 12,000.
I see myself then, hopefully, one day which would be my absolute dream come true, going to the biggest arenas in history possible. Going to stadiums, having 70,000 people at a show. Oh my gosh, that was a gigantic number, don&apos;t know where that came from? It would just be incredible.

Middleton became a member of the British royal family when she married Prince William in 2011. William, 36, is the queen’s grandson and second in line to the throne.
The couple share three children: Princes George and Louis, as well as Princess Charlotte.
“Kate’s been taking on new responsibilities little by little over the last few years, so it won’t be a shock when the time comes,” Long explained. “William and Kate are the favorite royals to take the crown in many generations, so the people of the U.K. are very excited about it.”
Elizabeth, 92, is also determined to show Middleton how to settle into her future title gracefully in the public eye.
“She’s really taken Kate under her wing,” a source close to the royal family told Us Weekly. “The two of them will often spend hours discussing royal life and the future of the monarchy.”
“It’s taken a long time for Kate to get to where she is today,” added a second insider. “But she’s ready.”
Earlier this month, royal expert Katie Nicholl told Glamour magazine that rumors of an alleged feud between Middleton and Markle are greatly exaggerated, but that doesn’t mean the sisters-in-law are necessarily eager to hang out together.
""I think this idea of there being a catfight between the two duchesses has made tantalizing headlines, but I don&apos;t believe that,"" royal expert Katie Nicholl told Glamour. ""I&apos;ve never heard from my sources that there has ever been a feud or a falling out.""
However, Nicholl says there is one rumored incident between the royal wives that she does think holds some water.
""I had heard about an upset over the dress fitting for Princess Charlotte,"" Nicholl said, referring to Markle allegedly making Middleton cry ahead of Prince Harry&apos;s royal wedding. ""And I had heard that while Harry was very keen for the two of them to become best friends, there was never that sort of a friendship.""
""I know in the early days Kate invited Meghan over to apartment 1A for tea. Obviously, she took her on that high-profile trip to Wimbledon, so they have spent time together. But what I think hasn&apos;t happened is — they haven&apos;t become best friends out of all of it,"" Nicholl said. ""That&apos;s not to say they hate each other. I don&apos;t believe that to be the case at all.""
""They quite quickly realized they were two pretty mature women – quite different women – and really the only thing they had in common was they&apos;d married princes,"" Nicholl explained. ""Not just Prince Harry, I think probably the world wanted them to become best friends.""
However, Nicholl does believe that Prince Harry and Prince William may not have seen eye to eye recently. Reports suggested that William warned Harry not to rush into marriage with Markle, while allegedly ""riled"" the Ginger Prince.
""I do think there is some truth to there having been some tension — not just between the duchesses but between the dukes, as well,"" Nicholl said. ""As we all know, things can gather momentum pretty quickly. So while I think there&apos;s been tension, I don&apos;t believe there has been some feud.""
As for Markle and Middleton&apos;s recent highly publicized hug, Nicholl says that was a strategic move.
""I do know that Meghan and Kate have come to an agreement to get along, to make an effort, to be amiable and warm toward each other in public,"" she said. ""They both realize it&apos;s in neither of their interests to have these catfight headlines. It&apos;s not what either of them wants.""

Harry Hamlin reveals the secret behind his lasting marriage to ‘Real Housewives’ star Lisa Rinna,www.foxnews.com,Stephanie Nolasco,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/harry-hamlin-reveals-the-secret-behind-his-lasting-marriage-to-real-housewives-star-lisa-rinna,"Email
Harry Hamlin and Lisa Rinna attend the 26th annual Elton John AIDS Foundation's Academy Awards Viewing Party on March 4, 2018 in West Hollywood, Calif. — Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin tied the knot in 1997 — and the relationship still works for the Hollywood couple despite being complete opposites. “Lisa and I are of the same mind,” Hamlin, 67, told Us Weekly Wednesday. “When you get married, you get married. So we have a very functional relationship and we respect each other and listen to each other and admire each other and we let each other be. We’re not helicopter husband and wife.”
HARRY HAMLIN TALKS COLLEGE SCANDAL
The actor admitted that despite their lasting union, he and the “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star, 55, have very little in common.
“I have no idea why opposites attract but we are completely and utterly opposite,” explained Hamlin . “But I love to cook and she doesn’t, so we all get fed up as a result of that. I have no interest in pop culture and she does so whatever I know about pop culture I get from her. As far as the science stuff goes, she’s marginally into that but she’s very busy with all the things that she’s doing.”
Hamlin and Rinna are proud parents of daughters Delilah Belle and Amelia Gray. The couple also became professional partners when they created their former fashion line, Bell Gray, several years ago.
“The business we start with the clothing company, our clothing company is really where her heart lies, I think, because she’s a fashionista and she loves fashion, as do my children,” said Hamlin. “But the two of us, she’s able to do the creative part of fashion and I’m able to do the business part so we keep the company going. I can keep the nuts and bolts going and she keeps the fun stuff going.”
“We’re a good team,” added Hamlin.

HARRY HAMLIN ALMOST DIVORCED LISA RINNA WHEN SHE JOINED 'REAL HOUSEWIVES'
Hamlin was previously married to actress Laura Johnson from 1985 until 1989. He then said “I do” a second time to “Desperate Housewives” actress Nicollette Sheridan from 1991 until 1992.
“This is my third time at it, but it wasn’t… the two times before that it disappeared, the marriages disappeared was not for lack of trying on my part,” said Hamlin.
In February, Hamlin and Rinna stirred headlines over the actor’s past. The pair doubled down on their claim that Sheridan cheated on Hamlin with pop star Michael Bolton while they were still married.
The allegations stem from a recent episode of “Real Housewives” were Rinna alleged Sheridan went to a Michael Bolton concert and left with him, sparking their divorce and leaving the way clear for Rinna to pick up the pieces, People reported .
HARRY HAMLIN SEES SOME LUCILLE BALL IN LISA RINNA
Days after the allegations debuted, Sheridan, 55, took to Twitter to decry the rumors as “fake news.”
“Harry and I ended our marriage nose to nose in Canada… Michael was a long time friend that was invited to our wedding… Happy Harry found happiness with housewife @lisarinna,” she wrote.
Adding fuel to the fire, Hamlin chimed in, taking to Twitter to slam his ex-wife and reiterate the cheating claims.
“Re Fake News! What’s it called when your wife of one year suddenly goes to bed with a pop singer? …two weeks after your mother dies?? I did a lotta stuff with my wife ‘nose to nose’ but ending our marriage was not one of them!” he wrote.
'HAPPY DAYS' STAR HENRY WINKLER REVEALS THE SECRET BEHIND HIS LASTING MARRIAGE
Rinna replied soon after, twisting the knife by calling Sheridan “the gift that keeps on giving.”
ET Canada reported that Rinna penned a lengthier retort on her Instagram Story that has since been deleted that read: “My bad, I’m sorry, Nicollette. I forgot to thank you also. Thank you for f---ing Michael Bolton and cheating on Harry while married. I thought I’d take the high road and not tweet this… NAH.”
In what appears to be a response to Hamlin’s tweet, Sheridan fired back by threatening to share truths that he might not want to be made public.
“Do you really want the truth shared?” she tweeted. “I appreciate that you want to support your housewife’s FAKE NEWS narrative, but the end of our marriage had nothing to do with anyone other than us. Sad you still can’t own your part.@HarryRHamlin @lisarinna.”
Sheridan was briefly engaged to Bolton in 2005. However, the couple broke off their engagement in August 2008.

Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model Paulina Porizkova says she’s ’54 and proud of it’ after sizzling snaps,www.foxnews.com,Stephanie Nolasco,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sports-illustrated-swimsuit-model-paulina-porizkova-says-shes-54-and-proud-of-it-after-sizzling-snaps,"Published 4 hours ago Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model Paulina Porizkova says she’s ’54 and proud of it’ after sizzling snaps Paulina Porizkova opens up about posing topless for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue at age 53 Czech-born model Paulina Porizkova called it an honor to be invited to pose topless for the 2019 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue at age 53. Last year, Porizkova posed nude for the magazine and penned an 'In Her Own Words' essay for the publication in which she discussed aging. According to Paulina Porizkova , she’s “54 and proud of it.” The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model took to Instagram Tuesday where she shared a makeup-free selfie to her 57.9K followers.
PAULINA PORIZKOVA OPENS UP ABOUT POSING TOPLESS FOR SI SWIMSUIT
“This, folks, is the real me, no fillers, no Botox, no makeup,” Porizkova captioned the photo. “Granted, if I showed you what I look like in really bad light, or took a shot of my IPad reflection, I’d be a little less proud.”
The Czech-born supermodel recently landed a spot in the May 2019 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue . Porizkova was first shot for the magazine in 1983 when she was 23. Porizkova would go on to appear regularly in the publication from 1983-1986, again in 1989, 1992, 2004 and for the SI Swimsuit 50th Anniversary Legends edition in 2014.
She was also invited back last year as part of SI’s female-empowerment, body-paint special titled “In Her Own Words,” which also featured Aly Raisman , Hunter McGrady and Olivia Culpo , among others.
“My first thought was what an amazing idea it was to put a woman my age in SI as just one of the many ‘girls,’” Porizkova told People magazine in January of this year about her sizzling snaps for the upcoming issue.
PLUS SIZE MODEL HUNTER MCGRADY IS SI SWIMSUIT'S NEW ROOKIE
“Me, as the oldest ‘girl’ in the SI stable,” continued Porizkova. “My second thought was, oh, yeah s---, that means I will have to pose in a bikini with a bunch of 20-year-olds. It was at once thrilling and disconcerting. Although I am militant about aging women still being sexy and beautiful, I don’t always feel that way… But refusing was out of the question. I was honored to be invited to break a barrier. I would just have to suck it up, or IN, rather, and hope for a photographer who knew his light.”
Porizkova also shared that she wore the same type of bikinis and bathing suits she would have worn 30 years ago for her latest photo shoot.
“In fact, in one instance, almost less with nothing but a G-string and a hat,” added Porizkova.
When it comes to modeling in her 50s, Porizkova said she got inspiration from another Sports Illustrated Swimsuit star.
“ Jule Campbell shared Christie Brinkley’s technique of turning my hips to the side and shoulders to the camera while breathing in and holding my breath,” she explained. “I, to this day, tell all my girlfriends concerned with their hips (too much or too little), how to turn so they can look awesome in a bikini shot. Thanks, Christie!”
CHRISTIE BRINKLEY NAMES HER BIGGEST REGRET
In May 2018, it was revealed that after 28 years of marriage to The Cars’ frontman, Ric Ocasek , Porizkova was single again. She had previously announced that the couple has been “peacefully separated for the past year.” They have two sons.
“It’s so scary and weird,” Porizkova told Closer Weekly about starting over. “I don’t know what to make out of it yet.”
However, one thing is certain for the two-time Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover girl. She has no plans to make a trip down the aisle anytime soon, if ever.
“I feel like I’ve had my soulmate,” she insisted.

And Porizkova added she just doesn’t have time for romance these days.
“I’m finishing up a memoir, giving a TED Talk next week and doing a TV pilot,” she explained. “And I really want to learn Italian. I want to seize the day and have some fun!”
Porizkova shocked fans on social media when she previously announced the split on Instagram.
CAMILLE KOSTEK NAMED 2019 SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT ROOKIE
“Our family always has been – and still is – a well-built car,” she explained. “When the four of us are together, we can go wherever the road takes us. But as a bicycle, my husband and I no longer pedal in unison. So, we’re ditching the bicycle.
“Ric and I have been peacefully separated for the past year. The photos of our happy family are, in fact, happy family photos; we are just no longer a couple.
“The love we have for one another is so wide and deep it’s practically tangible, and that sort of love can never disappear. Expect to keep seeing happy family photos.
“As I’m sure you can understand, out of respect for our children and each other, we’ll not be commenting further (here or elsewhere) at this time.”
Porizkova and Ocasek first met while The Cars were filming the music video for “Drive” in 1984.
Back in 2015, Porizkova told Yahoo she was grateful to have someone like Ocasek in her life.

“I agree, we did get lucky to find the right person, having the brains to know that it’s the right person, and to work on it and not let it fall apart when things aren’t easy,” she said at the time.
“It’s always challenging with two people with separate careers,” she added. “I know models and rock stars have a rep. It’s hard when you spend a lot of time apart. Sometimes you risk growing apart. I’ve seen that a lot of times… [But] we have always been close as a family unit. “We have always traveled together and enjoyed spending time together.” On Our Radar "

Filipino archaeologist Armand Salvador Mijares said Thursday the discovery of the remains, which belonged to three individuals, in Callao Cave in Cagayan province made the Philippines an important research ground on human evolution. The new specie is called Homo luzonensis after the main northern island of Luzon, where the remains were dug up starting in 2007.
Another archaeologist, Eusebio Dizon, says the remains are the oldest to be found in the Philippines, predating those discovered in Tabon Cave by thousands of years. Trending in World"

It also comes ahead of Thursday’s meeting between Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in Washington. “It did not directly mention the U.S., but linked sanctions with hostile forces,” said Shin Beom-chul, a senior fellow at the Asian Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. “He’s saying North Korea would take an independent course unless the U.S. offered to lift sanctions. You maintain sanctions, you’re a hostile force; if you ease sanctions, you’re not.”
Kim has continued his economic push in recent weeks despite the sanctions, Reuters reported . His meeting with Trump ended over differences about how much North Korea was willing to limit its nuclear program and how much the U.S. was willing to ease economic sanctions.
On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a congressional committee that he would like to leave “a little room” in the sanctions in case North Korea makes progress in giving up its nuclear weapons.

Mike Gonzalez: Heritage Foundation president unfairly targeted by Google News,www.foxnews.com,Mike Gonzalez,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mike-gonzalez,"Email The left must control the narrative. It will be nasty about making sure it does and won’t care for niceties. It is part of “the will to power” that propelled Lenin and Mussolini to rule. Only this time a gaggle of coddled, probably mostly white, liberals at Google and academia have taken on more than they can handle. Meet my boss, a stately lady from old Richmond. She grew up eating deep-fried frog legs her brothers and her father fished out of the pond out back. She then became one of two dozen black children who integrated a school in the erstwhile Confederate capital, braving taunts, shoves and being stuck with pins.
Around here, we call her “Mrs. James.” The rest of the world knows her as the president of The Heritage Foundation, Kay Coles James .
PENNY NANCE: SHAME ON GOOGLE FOR DISSOLVING ITS AI COUNCIL OVER AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADER KAY COLES JAMES
Earlier this year, Google invited James to join an artificial intelligence advisory council that would exchange views to help guide Google’s policies in this area. No sooner was this announced that some Google employees circulated a petition demanding that the Mountain View, California tech giant remove her from the post.
The petition was eventually signed by some 2,500 people, not just at Google, but at dozens of universities in the United States and Canada and woke companies such as Lyft and Vox Media. The company gave in to the mob last week and disbanded the council.
James’s transgression? The petition accused her of being “anti-trans, anti-LGBTQ and anti-immigrant,” and produced as evidence these three tweets.
James is none of those things. She has traditional conservative views, as a mere scan of the tweets will reveal. In fact, we invite you to go further than tweets and read our papers on these and other issues at Heritage.org .
Traditional conservative views are held by the executive and a majority of the U.S. Senate, as well as the majority of the state houses and legislatures in the 50 states. Somebody must have elected them. So what’s up?
Since Antonio Gramsci, an influential Italian communist in the first part of the 20th century, the left has called society’s traditional views “the hegemonic narrative.” Gramsci observed in the 1930s that Marx had a century earlier forecast that the working class would rise up, yet not many revolutions had happened.
The problem, he thought, was that the worker was being acculturated to do the bidding of his master. He had “false consciousness” and would need to be indoctrinated out of it.
“Man is primarily a creature of spirit – that is, a creation of history, rather than nature. Otherwise, it would be impossible to explain that why it is that, when the exploiters and the exploited have always existed, socialism has never yet come into being,” wrote Gramsci.
The answer, Gramsci and his many disciples in academia later on would find, was to undertake what the German radical academic Rudi Dutschke in the 1960s called “The long march through the institutions.” That is, society would have to be subverted from within by taking over the institutions of learning and culture-making.
The reference – lest the reader miss it – is to “The Long March” that Mao’s band of communists undertook in the frigid winters and long hot summers of China in the 1930s, before defeating the Kuomingtang in 1949. It has been attributed to Gramsci himself, but as the late professor Joseph A. Buttigieg, one of the nation’s foremost experts on Gramsci (and father of the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg) pointed out, does belong to Dutschke.
To transform “the facts of vassalage into triggers of rebellion and social construction,” Gramsci wrote, revolution would have to be preceded by “by an intense labor of criticism, by the diffusion of culture and the spread of ideas amongst masses of men who are at first resistant.”
And there would have to be what another Gramsci acolyte, the German-American Columbia University professor Herbert Marcuse, called “Repressive Tolerance.” Writing in 1965, he called for “the practice of discriminating tolerance in an inverse direction, as a means of shifting the balance between Right and Left by restraining the liberty of the Right, thus counteracting the pervasive inequality of freedom.”
As Rodney Fopp wrote, Marcuse’s argument “was trenchantly criticized because it was anti‐democratic and defied the academic canon of value neutrality. Yet his argument is attracting renewed interest in the 21st century.” Indeed.
These are the forebears of the Google Petition Signers. Having taken over most of the academy, Hollywood and the media, they have set their sights on the new commanding heights, the Internet. Thus, we see this bias not just at Google, but also in Twitter, Facebook and the others.
As professor Paul Kengor – one of the few non-leftists in that field – recently pointed out, even Wikipedia is getting in on the act by attempting to smear any discussion of Gramsci and the rest.
What can conservatives do? Supporting regulating tech giants is a tempting option – one that must be resisted. Google, Facebook, Twitter and the others would thrive in it, as monopolists always do. That is why they’re asking for it.
But we can refuse to be silent. We can ridicule the irony of white rich kids trying to silence someone who suffered to give America real equality.
Why do I say white? Not because it matters to us, but because it does to them, as they say they are fighting for racial justice.

Google’s workforce may be famously (infamously, according to the woke) close to 40 percent Asian, but a perusal of the names in the petition reveals that they are overwhelming of European origin. Also, as the Hidden Tribes Project has demonstrated, these woke views are held overwhelmingly by white elites, who – as they have now again demonstrated – will be merciless with those in the “marginalized groups” who refuse to express their ideas.
So, no, we won’t be quiet. James, as Margaret Thatcher said, “is not for turning.” Nor are we. Mike Gonzalez is a senior fellow at the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy at The Heritage Foundation. Trending in Opinion "
Legendary long-lost BMW M1 speed record supercar unearthed from London garage,www.foxnews.com,Gary Gastelu,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/legendary-long-lost-bmw-m1-speed-record-supercar-unearthed-from-london-shed,"But when the Coys of Kensington classic car auction house specialist arrived at the East London address, things changed very quickly. Sitting there was a legendary BMW land speed record car that that had fallen off the collector car world&apos;s radar a quarter-century ago. The special 1979 M1 was created at the behest of Austrian racing driver Harald Ertl, who teamed up with British Petroleum to modify the mid-engine coupe to run on liquefied petroleum gas, or autogas, which the company was looking to promote as a motor vehicle fuel.
(Coys of Kensington)
BMW only produced 453 M1s from 1978 to 1981, with the help of Lamborghini, and stock versions are prized collectibles that can sell for $700,000 or more. By adding twin-turbos to the M1’s inline-6-cylinder engine, Ertl’s team were able to increase its power from 277 hp to around 410 hp, which was a lot in 1981. The bodywork was also customized to improve its aerodynamics, and associate sponsor Blaupunkt installed a batch of its speakers for good measure.
BMW built just 453 M1s. (BMW)
On October 17, 1981, Ertl took the violet car to Volkswagen’s Ehra-Lessien high-speed test track , which is a 12-mile-long circuit that features a perfectly flat 5.6-mile straight, and set a mark of 187.3 mph. However, there wasn’t a sanctioning body present to verify the record, so it was never officially recognized.
Tragically, Ertl was killed in a plane crash the following year before he could try again and the car sold.
After changing hands several times and ending up at a dealership in England, it was purchased by a pharmacist in England named Pummy Bhatia in 1993, who passed away just 2 years later.

(John Stillwell/PA via AP) LONDON – The Latest on the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in London (all times local): 11:15 a.m.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman says Russia wants Julian Assange's rights to be observed following his arrest.
Shortly after Assange's arrest in London, Dmitry Peskov told reporters that he could not comment on the overall case.
But, he said, ""We of course hope that all of his rights will be observed.""

11 a.m.
Ecuador's president says his government withdrew asylum status for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange almost seven years after he sought refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London, citing ""repeated violations of international conventions and daily-life protocols.""
Lenin Moreno announced the ""sovereign decision"" in a statement accompanied by a video on Twitter on Thursday.
Assange hasn't left the embassy since August 2012 for fear that if he steps off Ecuador's diplomatic soil he would be arrested and extradited to the U.S. for publishing thousands of classified military and diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks.
London police arrested Assange at the embassy Thursday on a court warrant issued in 2012, when he failed to surrender to the court.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt thanked Moreno for breaking the impasse, saying on Twitter that Assange ""is no hero and no one is above the law.""

WikiLeaks Julian Assange arrest draws fierce international reaction,www.foxnews.com,Ryan Gaydos,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/wikileaks-julian-assange-arrest-international-reaction,"Assange’s arrest drew sharp reactions from his supporters and those who oppose him. WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization which Assange founded and for which he published multiple secret U.S. military cables regarding the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, condemned the Ecuadorean and British governments for arresting Assange.
Edward Snowden, who infamously leaked highly classified NSA information, tweeted Assange&apos;s arrest was ""going to end up in the history books.""
He later added the U.S. charge against Assange was weak.
Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom tweeted the “fight for his freedom kicks into high gear.”
Pamela Anderson, who previously told Fox News she had a close relationship with Julian Assange, retweeted something from April 4 as an apparent response to his arrest.
Her tweet from April 5 means ""the truth will prevail.""
She also added: “I am in shock,” Anderson wrote in a tweet. “I couldn’t hear clearly what he said? He looks very bad. How could you [Ecuador]? (Because he exposed you).How could you UK.? Of course - you are America’s b---- and you need a diversion from your idiotic Brexit brecirt.”
H.M. So, a Korean-American author, argued that the Assange arrested was a bad look for Western society.
The ACLU released a statement on Assange&apos;s arrest as well.
“Any prosecution by the United States of Mr. Assange for Wikileaks’ publishing operations would be unprecedented and unconstitutional, and would open the door to criminal investigations of other news organizations. Moreover, prosecuting a foreign publisher for violating U.S. secrecy laws would set an especially dangerous precedent for U.S. journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public&apos;s interest,” Ben Wizner, the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, said in a statement.
Journalist Glenn Greenwald tweeted: ""US journalists have long hated WikiLeaks because they have published stories of far greater importance & impact than most of those journalists in the lifetime will ever publish, all without being part of their little club. But to cheer the Trump DOJ prosecution is just grotesque.""
Greenwald also hit out at NBC News for the way the news organization was covering the Assage arrest.
Evo Morales, the president of Bolivia, condemned the arrest of Assange.
""We strongly condemn the detention of Julian Assange and the violation of freedom of expression. Our solidarity is with this brother who is persecuted by the government for revealing its human rights violations, murders of civilians and diplomatic espionage,"" he tweeted .
Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno described the decision to withdraw Assange’s asylum as a “sovereign decision” because of his alleged repeated violations.
“Today I announce that the discourteous and aggressive behavior of Mr. Julian Assange, the hostile and threatening declarations of its allied organization, against Ecuador, and especially the transgression of international treaties, have led the situation to a point where the asylum of Mr. Assange is unsustainable and no longer viable,” Moreno said in a video statement posted on Twitter.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt thanked the Ecuadorean government for their cooperation with the Assange arrest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May also said that Assange&apos;s arrest proved that ""no one is above the law.""
A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said the country wants Assange’s rights to be observed, but couldn’t comment on the overall case.
“We of course hope that all of his rights will be observed,” Peskov told reporters.
Assange, 47, has been in the embassy since 2012 when British courts ordered him extradited to Sweden to face questioning in a sexual assault case. That matter has since been dropped, but Wikileaks is facing a federal grand jury investigation over its publication of American diplomatic and military secrets during the Iraq War.

(iStock) ISLAMABAD – A Pakistani court is allowing two teenage sisters from the minority Hindu community to live with their Muslim husbands after a government probe concluded they're both adults and hadn't been forced to convert and marry the men. Thursday's decision says medical checks found the girls, from southern Sindh province, to be 18 and 19 years old. It says they converted and married of their own free will.
The girls' parents, who were in the court for the decision, expressed shock at the ruling and said they'd speak later. Earlier, they had said their daughters are underage and were abducted and forced to convert.
Last month, the court placed the girls and their husbands in separate protective shelters.

She said together they have deep chats about all aspects of life: they talk about everything from the Bible to animal rights, “and last time he started talking about jealousy.”

The Islanders won 4-3. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) Josh Bailey didn't have much time to think when he saw the puck on the side of the crease after Mathew Barzal's try hit the left goalpost in overtime. Bailey just swooped in and knocked it into the net to send the New York Islanders home with a win. Bailey scored at 4:39 of the extra period and the Islanders beat the Pittsburgh Penguin s 4-3 on Wednesday night in the opener of their Eastern Conference first-round playoff series.
""It just happened so quick,"" Bailey said. ""I wasn't sure. It didn't lay very flat for me. I was just trying to whack it and hope it went in. ... A crucial game. There's still a long way to go, but a good win for us.""
Barzal had brought the puck into the offensive zone on a 2-on-1 break, faked in front to draw Matt Murray out and sent the backhand shot that bounced off the left post. He was initially upset with himself at missing the opportunity before he saw Bailey come up and put it in.
""I see the puck laying there and I was just obviously (angry), I thought the chance had ended,"" Barzal said. ""And I see Bails come in and swoop in and bury it. I was obviously super happy to see that. Awesome for him. First game and that's nice for the confidence.""
Jordan Eberle had a goal and an assist, and Brock Nelson and Nick Leddy also scored for New York, which was opening a postseason series at home for the first time in 31 years. Robin Lehner stopped 41 shots.
Game 2 is Friday night back at the Nassau Coliseum.
Phil Kessel and Evgeni Malkin each had a goal and an assist, and Justin Schultz also scored for the Penguins. Murray finished with 29 saves.
""It was a hard-fought game,"" Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. ""It wasn't perfect out there by any stretch, but I thought we played hard.""
Tom Kuhnhackl, who had a goal in the opening minute of the game waved off for offside, nearly won it for the Islanders 1:12 into the extra period as he crashed into Murray and the puck crossed the goal line — but not before the net came loose. The no-goal was confirmed after a review.
The Islanders led three times in regulation with the Penguins managing to tie it each time.
""We just stayed to it,"" Islanders coach Barry Trotz said. ""I liked our composure on the bench. There were a lot of twists and turns to that game. ... (We) didn't flinch at all.""
Leddy gave the Islanders a 3-2 lead with 7:25 left in the third as he sent a long shot from left point at the blue line that knuckled past Murray.
With Murray pulled for an extra skater, Schultz fired a one-timer from the left circle inside the left post with 1:29 left.
Bailey had a chance at the winner for the Islanders in the closing seconds, but his shot hit the right post. He was glad it didn't end up being a costly miss.
""I was afraid I was going to have to see that in my nightmares for a while,"" Bailey said. ""Yeah, a little bit of redemption. Just happy to get the win.""
Malkin tied it 2-2 on a power play with 6:19 left in the middle period as his shot from the inside edge of the right circle deflected off Islander defenseman Adam Pelech's stick and up past Lehner.
The raucous crowd that was chanting ""Let's Go Islanders!"" from before the teams came out for pregame warmups, roared when the Islanders stepped on the ice and booed loudly when the Penguins followed. They got loud again in the minutes before the teams emerged from their dressing rooms for the start of the game.
Pittsburgh outshot New York 17-12 in the first period, but the Islanders led 2-1 after 20 minutes.
Just more than a minute after Kuhnhackl's opening-minute goal was overturned, Eberle did give the Islanders the lead as he stopped a deflection of Pelech's shot, turned and beat Murray through the five-hole from the right side for his first career postseason goal at 1:40.
The Penguins tied it when Dominik Simon brought the puck down the middle and dropped a pass back to Kessel, who put it past Lehner off the post and in at 5:42.
Nelson put the Islanders back in front on the power play as he got a pass in front from Eberle and put it past Murray with 4:14 left in the opening period.
NOTES: Malkin, Sidney Crosby and Kris Letang are the only Penguins players remaining from the 2013 playoff series against the Islanders. New York has five players left — Nelson, Josh Bailey, Casey Cizikas, Thomas Hickey and Matt Martin. ... Kessel also scored in each of the last three games during the regular season. ... Malkin's goal was his 63rd in the playoffs, breaking a tie with Bobby Hull for sole possession of 26th place on the NHL's career list.

Blue Jackets rally from 3-goal deficit to beat Lightning 4-3,www.foxnews.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/stanley-cup-playoffs-2019-blue-jackets-lightning-game-1,"Email
The Columbus Blue Jackets celebrates their 4-3 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning during Game 1 of an NHL Eastern Conference first-round hockey playoff series Wednesday, April 10, 2019, in Tampa, Fla. (AP Photo/Chris O'Meara) The Columbus Blue Jackets rebounded from a dismal start to stun the team that had the NHL's best regular-season record. Seth Jones scored the go-ahead goal on the power play to cap Columbus' three-goal third period, and the Blue Jackets rallied to beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 4-3 in Game 1 of the teams' first-round Eastern Conference playoff series Wednesday night.
""We can't get comfortable,"" Jones said. ""Nothing is going to get easier. It's only going to get harder.""
Jones made it 4-3 from the slot with 5:55 to play as the Blues Jackets erased a 3-0 deficit after the Lightning scored three times in the opening period.
With Columbus trailing 3-1 in the third, David Savard deked around Lightning defenseman Victor Hedman and scored 7:56 into the period to make it a one-goal game. Josh Anderson picked up a short-handed goal that tied it at 3 at 11:54.
The Blue Jackets became the 27th NHL team to overcome at least a three-goal deficit to win a playoff game in regulation.
Nick Foligno had the other goal for Columbus, and Sergei Bobrovsky ended up with 26 saves after struggling in the first period.
The Lightning, who matched the 1995-96 Detroit Red Wings for the most wins in a regular season with 62, got first-period goals from Alex Killorn, Anthony Cirelli and Yanni Gourde. Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 22 shots.
""Our mentality was, we wanted to outscore them tonight instead of build a lead and then shut then down,"" Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. ""Our mentality has to be when we get in these situations is shut teams down, not to add to the lead.""
Tampa Bay scored 325 goals in 2018-19, the most by any team in 23 years.
Hedman returned after missing the final four regular-season game with an upper-body injury. The Norris Trophy winner took a helmet to the face during a collision with Washington's Carl Hagelin on March 30.
Killorn stole the puck from Jones at the blue line during a power play for Columbus and put a backhander past Bobrovsky to open the scoring 4:12 into the game. Tampa Bay was tied for third in short-handed goals during the regular season with 12.
After Cirelli had a rebound goal at 11:01, Gourde's waist-high deflection of Mikhail Sergachev's shot made it 3-0 with 2:10 left in the first.
""We're just losing too many battles,"" Blue Jackets coach John Tortorella said of his first-intermission message. ""Just the grind of the game. We have to be able to grind with them.""
Foligno cut the deficit to 3-1 at 9:15 of the second on a breakaway goal after Tampa Bay's Ryan McDonagh made an errant pass in the offensive zone.
Alexandre Texier, Columbus' 19-year-old rookie who played in the Blue Jackets' final two regular-season games, skated in alone on Vasilevskiy but missed the net on a shot with 4 minutes to go in the first.
Bobrovsky stopped four shots over the final 40 seconds of the second, including a nifty glove save on Steven Stamkos.
""We don't have a chance if he doesn't play the way he played through the second and the third,"" Tortorella said of Bobrovsky.
Nikita Kucherov, who had an NHL-best 128 points in the regular season, was held without a point but had an in-close chance turned aside by Bobrovsky and hit the crossbar during the opening minute of the second during a power play.
""I don't know if it's a wake-up call, but we know it's a tough league to win in and we want to be better when we're up 3-0,"" Hedman said.
NOTES: Tampa Bay outscored Columbus 17-3 in sweeping all three games between the teams in the regular season. ... Lightning D Anton Stralman sat out with a lower-body injury, but might return during the series. ... RW Ryan Callahan and D Braydon Coburn were among Tampa Bay's healthy scratches. ... Columbus D Adam McQuaid (upper-body injury) didn't play.
QUOTABLE
""You can go through all the numbers, all the things, them against us, but when you play a 60-minute hockey game and you go through the momentum swings and the surges and maybe the big plays out of someone unexpected or a lousy play from someone unexpected, that changes games. So, that's why it's always up for grabs.""— Tortorella before the game on the unpredictability of playoff hockey.
