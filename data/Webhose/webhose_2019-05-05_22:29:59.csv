KARACHI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : Sindh government , taking into account the province's high burden in terms of tuberculosis (TB), has developed a multi-sectoral accountability framework to reduce overall prevalence of the disease.
Concerned officials talking to APP Friday said provincial health department has taken the lead in directing the development and implementing the Multi-Sectoral responsibility frame work so as to effectively handle burden of 120,000 new cases of TB every year.
Sixty percent of these patients were said to be provided with treatment and mostly cured, however, some 48,000 cases (40%) were missed and not notified in the health system.
In the given circumstances the multi-sectorial approach initiated in close coordination with Dopasi Foundation and the Geneva Based Stop TB Partnership was said to have been adopted with the provision of community based treatment.
Mentioning that cross-sectoral efforts to combat TB is in line with the recommendations of the United Nations General Assembly , the officials said Badin has been nominated as the model district to initiate the process.
Additional Secretary (Public Health), Sindh Department of Health at provincial level and Deputy Commissioner Badin at district level, have been assigned with the responsibility to mobilize the support of all line departments.
Sindh Health Minister Dr. Azra Pechuho has already advised all the social sector departments and health development partners to make concerted efforts and supported the health department to rid the province of this menace.
Meanwhile, Dr. Ghulam Nabi Kazi, associated with 'Dopasi Foundation', responding to APP queries said social awareness aimed at de-stigmatization of the disease is an essential component of the strategy.
The initiative was also cited to in accordance to the national health priorities and international obligations country was required to be fulfilled.
""TB elimination is crucial to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goal relating to achieving universal health coverage,"" said Dr. Kazi, adding that TB control itself was an integral part of WHO's universal health coverage campaign.
The senior activist of the country, working for the cause of healthcare for past several years, emphasized that WHO guideline would be fully utilized in the process encompassing a community-based treatment approach for TB.
Certain other factors such as malnutrition, smoking and diabetes will also be addressed as far as practicable by adopting a holistic approach particularly for the vulnerable and marginalized population segments living in poverty.
Running of TB program in a vertical manner is a major challenge and necessitates an integrated approach to address the social determinants of health in relation to TB, he said.
""A paradigm shift spearheaded by the Deputy Commissioners appears essential for tracing the missing TB cases,"" said the activist.
Sindh was incidentally the first province to develop the PC 1 for TB and achieve universal TB-DOTS implementation in 2003 and it was once again poised to be the first one to implement the District TB Multi-Sectoral Responsibility Framework, focusing on priorities such as provision of anti-TB drugs , diagnostic facilities, innovations, research and protection of human rights.
The role of the private sector including hospitals, laboratories, general practitioners and pharmacies was also cited to be critical to the whole process.
Efforts are also underway to make the Tuberculosis control prevention and control principles an integral part of the curriculum of medical undergraduates across the province and also of continuing medical education for doctors."

Paris, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday appointed a panel of experts to investigate France 's actions in Rwanda during the country's genocide 25 years ago, a subject that has dogged Franco-Rwandan relations since the 1994 massacres.
The commission of eight researchers and historians ""will be tasked with consulting all France 's archives relating to the genocide... in order to analyse the role and engagement of France during that period,"" the presidency said in a statement.
The commission will look at the period from 1990 to 1994 to ""contribute to a better understanding and knowledge of the genocide of Tutsis,"" the statement said.
The findings will be used in material used to teach people in France about the genocide, it added.
Rwanda has accused France of being complicit in the genocide of an estimated 800,000 mostly ethnic Tutsis through its support for the Hutu-led government of the day.
It also accuses the French forces who were stationed in Rwanda under a UN mandate of having helped some of the perpetrators to escape, with some seeking sanctuary in France .
Paris has consistently denied complicity in the bloodletting, which has cast a long shadow over Franco-Rwandan relations, leading Rwanda at one point to break off ties for three years.
Relations have improved in the past decade.
But Macron caused disappointment among genocide survivors by turning down an invitation to attend this weekend's genocide commemorations in Rwanda ."

Joseph (Joe) Robinette Biden Biden walks into Trump's punchline Biden accuser: I want him to take ownership of actions, apologize to Anita Hill Biden accuser slams joke on hugging: 'It's clear Joe Biden hasn't reflected at all' MORE on Saturday, stating that ""there's been not a whiff of personal scandal about him"" the former vice president.
""I don't seek to minimize the feelings of women who believe he was too close for their comfort. If they think it, then it was,"" Smerconish said on his weekly program Saturday morning. ""I only wish to suggest that this is how he is with men and women. And with Biden, there's nothing hidden, nor prurient about it.""
""In his half century of public service, he's touched literally tens of thousands of men and women. In all of that time, there's been not a whiff of personal scandal about him,"" he added. ""Look, there are reasons not to support Joe Biden for president, Smerconish later concluded. ""But his tactile nature isn't one of them.""
The defense comes one day after several women have come forward in recent days to accuse the potential 2020 presidential contender of touching them inappropriately or in ways that made them feel uncomfortable.
Biden addressed the controversy for the first time publicly on Friday with a pair of jokes.
Speaking Friday at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) conference, Biden joked that he had permission to hug the union president, Lonnie Stephenson.
“I want you to know, I had permission to hug Lonnie,” Biden said to laughter from the crowd.
Later, Biden invited several children on stage and shook their hands. Shortly after, he pulled one of the boys close and put his arm around him.
""By the way, he gave me permission to touch him,” Biden quipped.
Asked about the allegations by reporters after his speech, Biden did not apologize for his actions.
""I’m sorry I didn’t understand more,"" Biden said . ""I’m not sorry for any of my intentions. I’m not sorry for anything that I have ever done. I have never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman. So that’s not the reputation I’ve had since I was in high school, for God’s sake.""
Biden later appeared to address the pair of jokes, saying that he did not intend to ""make light of anyone's discomfort.""
Biden sought to address the controversy earlier this week, pledging to change his behavior but declining to issue an apology.
“Social norms have begun to change, they’ve shifted, and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset, and I get it,” Biden said in the video. “I hear what they’re saying. I understand it. I’ll be much more mindful. That’s my responsibility, and I’ll meet it.”
Biden has not officially announced his bid for the White House but is widely expected to in the coming weeks. The 76-year-old currently leads the polls among other declared 2020 Democratic contenders, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polling."

Eric Holcomb (R) is likely to sign a bill that would stop convicted animal abusers from owning pets, The Indianapolis Star reported Saturday. Both chambers of the Indiana legislature passed the bill to keep animal abusers from owning, keeping or training animals while they’re on parole or probation. The Hill has reached out to Holcomb’s office for comment. Forty-five people were sentenced for animal cruelty between 2014 and 2017, according to state analysts. The majority — 80 percent — were placed on probation for an average of 326 days, the paper reported. State Sen. Ron Alting (R), the bill's author, said the legislation aims to combat repeat offenders. ""It's common sense that, if a person is convicted of abusing an animal, then why in goodness sake should they be able to own an animal when they are on parole or probation? You know they will turn around and do the same thing,” Alting told the newspaper. Sharon Dull, an employee and volunteer for animal organizations, echoed the sentiment during a Senate committee hearing earlier this year. ""Lack of empathy and compassion are common traits among animal abusers,"" Dull said. ""They often view an animal as property and think it's their right to do whatever they please to the animal. They don't realize or they simply don't care that an animal feels pain just like humans do."" State lawmakers have considering several similar bills in other states. A bill pending in South Carolina would ban animal abusers in the state from adopting new pets for half a decade. A second bill being considered would permanently ban abusers from owning pets. Alting said he believes that the legal system only allows the legislature to ban convicted abusers from owning pets while they are still under court supervision, the newspaper noted. ""We wanted to do that,"" Alting said, ""but we found out legally we could not."""

Castaner's German counterpart, Horst Seehofer, said that Berlin shared a similar stance.
Seehofer said that Germany wanted to closely examine each case before taking action. While Germany acknowledges its responsibility for is citizens, it is in favor of international solutions, he added. The minister also stressed that sometimes people claimed to be citizens of a certain country, while, in fact, they were not, a situation that called for an investigation."

London, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : Prime Minister Theresa May asked the European Union on Friday to delay Britain's departure until June 30 while the bloc itself suggested that it might be best to postpone the split for up to a year.
The competing visions of how to unwind Britain's 46-year involvement in the European project will be hashed out again at an EU leader' summit in Brussels on Wednesday -- a clash analysts said May is likely to lose.
The current Brexit deadline of April 12 has already been pushed back once from March 29 because of the UK parliament 's failure on three occasions to back the deal May signed with the other 27 EU leaders in December .
May's formal request to EU Council president Donald Tusk said Britain proposes that the delay ""should end on June 30 2019 "" -- the same date she asked for at the last EU summit last month.
""If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the government proposes that the period should be terminated earlier,"" May wrote in a letter released by Downing Street.

""The fact that the US is discussing this publicly means the purchase can be accelerated... I am pleased to hear this. It is not surprising as we have already begun talks,"" Blaszczak was quoted as saying by the Polish Defense Ministry.
The minister confirmed that Poland wanted and had enough funds to buy at least 32 fifth-generation warplanes. The Eastern European nation adopted in March a defense procurement plan running into 2026, which includes replacing its obsolete fleet of Soviet-made Su-22 and MiG-29 jets."

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamanei called for US troops to leave Iraq as Iraq's Prime Minister was in Iraq for his first official visit Saturday. The ""U.S. military presence in Iraq is detrimental to countries and nations of the region. You should take actions to make the US withdraw its troops from Iraq because wherever they have had enduring presence, forcing them out has become problematic,"" the Ayatollah said. He went on to note that ""If the Iraqi government and officials follow the U.S., they won't have problems with them. ""But the current Iraqi government, parliament and political activists are unfavorable to the US, thus they devise plots to push this assembly out of the political scene in Iraq,"" he concludedThe goal of Iran now is to pressure the US in Iraq and cement its ties with Baghdad. Facing massive floods, Iran is nevertheless using the Iraqi leader's visit to push this narrative. It comes amid reports at the Wall Street Journal that the US will designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran as a terrorist organization. This could have major ramifications for Iran and also US policy in Iraq where the IRGC has been active in the past advising the Iraqi government in its war on ISIS. In recent months pro-Iranian groups in Iraq have threatened US troops.

GLASGOW - The Chelsea Football Club held a major fundraising event on Thursday to continue battling antisemitism in Britain, and with plans to expand its campaign to the US later this year. Under the leadership of club owner Roman Abramovich, Chelsea FC dedicated the star-studded dinner fundraiser to help finish funding for a new expansive Holocaust exhibition at the Imperial War Museums in London. The museum, which has a current Holocaust exhibit and opened in 2000, has its eyes set on revamping the exhibit’s narrative and to bring attention more profoundly to the community. “Education and awareness is the long-term focus,” said Bruce Buck, Chelsea FC’s chairman. “We were contacted by the trustee of the Imperial War Museum and they explained they were planning to do a whole new Holocaust gallery, and maybe there was a way for us to work with them.”The new section of the museum, scheduled to open in 2021, will take some of the existing material and integrate it with the World War II focus of the Imperial War Museums. In this way, the Holocaust’s account will be seen as part of the historical and social context that also influenced the war.The football club, which recognizes the oddity of pairing a sports team with a slightly marred past of racist behavior and incidents among fans, sees that the great influence it has over its fans makes it all the more imperative for it to educate and change attitudes.“We still have a few of those problems, they don’t go away all that easily, but we’ve had favorable reactions from our fans,” Buck said. “Football clubs are doing a lot of good causes activities in their community and around the world. They’re all doing projects that make sense for them and their constituents. No club has done a major thing with lots of projects and make it open-ended in terms of the term. But other clubs are doing it… and we’re happy to share our expertise that we’ve earned.”The “Light from the Dark” fundraiser event, held April 4, worked to close the gap of the last stretch of funding for the museum. Around 300 attendees were treated to an evening of discussion with local Holocaust survivors, as led by stars such as comedian David Baddiel, director Michael Attenborough and television courtroom celebrity Robert Rinder.For the Imperial War Museums, moving forward the story of the Holocaust is an absolute must. The revamped Holocaust gallery will also be flanked by a new learning center within the museum, dedicated to providing comfortable spaces for groups and individuals to hold sessions. For the museum, highlighting stories of survivors is “to make sure that their experiences and the lessons we must learn are never forgotten,” said Diane Lees, director-general of the Imperial War Museums.Whereas the Holocaust exhibit has been an offshoot of the museum’s layout, the new galleries will be “at the central chronological fulcrum of our iconic London museum and linking them, architecturally and conceptually, to our Second World War Galleries,” Lees said.As research has grown significantly since the original Holocaust exhibition opened nearly 20 years ago, the museum saw the need to include a more complete scale of the Nazis’ crimes, as well as those of their allies and collaborators, and to reframe the stories of Jewish life.Whereas most Holocaust museums, as well as the current exhibit at the Imperial War Museums, are rather dark and tend to physically create a sense of “closing in” on its visitors, the new museum wants to flip this concept.“Because we want to bring awareness that these crimes were not committed in the dark, in secret, but rather in full view,” said galleries curator and content leader James Bulgin. Bulgin said that the new museum will be well-lit and airy, to create the sense that this was something that was public after all, and that general society allowed the Nazis to commit these crimes.Chelsea FC’s campaign, titled “Say No to Antisemitism,” was launched January 2018 and has since seen its growth in collaborating with organizations, local fans and even looks ahead to its expansion in the US. In the meantime, Chelsea has created a guide for safety officers and stewards to combat antisemitism within its own home at Stamford Bridge, with the focus on educating those who spread antisemitism.Previous work in the short time the campaign has launched included a strong partnership with the World Jewish Congress. The club participated in the “We Remember” campaign to mark Holocaust Memorial Day, and worked with the WJC on its Red Card for Hate initiative. The initiative is a three-pronged approach to combat racism, xenophobia, discrimination and antisemitism in sports.The Pitch for Hope competition called on young people in the UK, the United States and in Israel to propose creative ideas for inspiring the spirit of camaraderie in sport and build bridges between different groups of people. Winners from the three countries were then invited to present their ideas at Stamford Bridge for Buck and also club director Eugene Tenenbaum, WJC CEO Robert Singer and others, including Chelsea Academy players.The competition is expected to be expanded to France and Germany in the next year.And not only that, the club and the WJC plan to stay in the face of fans by producing a series of videos to raise awareness about the effects of antisemitism and discrimination in general. Those videos have been shown during games and on social media platforms during this season, and will continue to be shown at future games.The next phase of the initiative will be to host a special forum, which is planned to bring together national football associations, clubs, players, government officials and civil social representatives to share best practices and create a space for open discussion and collaboration on the issue. The idea is to also help create a network of people and organizations for improving the fight against antisemitism in sports.The club will also play a game in the US against the New England Revolution, which will also be doubled as an opportunity to raise further awareness of the issue on an international scale. Proceeds from this event will go toward the survivors and families of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, following the Tree of Life Congregation massacre.

Assange was ""prepared"" for expulsion from the building, a British friend of his said on Tuesday, after Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno said he had ""repeatedly violated"" the terms of his asylum.Moreno accused Assange of harming Ecuador's relations with other countries by intervening in their politics and said he did not have the right to ""hack private accounts or phones."" WikiLeaks said Moreno's remarks were in retribution for WikiLeaks having reported on corruption accusations against Moreno, who denies wrongdoing."

KIGALI, April 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Rwanda embarks on a week of commemoration activities and 100 days of national mourning on Sunday to mark the 25th anniversary of the genocide in which 800,000 people - one tenth of its population - were killed in 100 days of slaughter. Here are some facts about one of the darkest chapters in human history: * On the night of April 6, 1994, a plane carrying then Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and his counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi - both Hutus - was shot down, killing everyone on board.* Hutu extremists blamed the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) - a rebel group made of exiled Tutsis - and launched a campaign of slaughter against Tutsis. The RPF claim the plane was shot down by Hutus to provide an excuse for the genocide.* Over the next 100 days, more than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered by Hutu extremists, led by the Rwandan army and a militia known as the Interahamwe.* They set up road blocks across the country and went from house to house killing men, women and children. They used radio broadcasts to incite hatred against Tutsis and called on ordinary Hutus to identify and kill all Tutsis.* Hutu leaders handed out ""kill lists"" to militias familiar with local communities so they could locate and murder Tutsis. Neighbors killed neighbors and Hutu husbands even murdered their Tutsi wives out of fear for their own lives.* Many Tutsis fled to churches to seek sanctuary, but priests and nuns in some cases informed militias of sheltering Tutsis who then killed them, either by burning down the churches or slaughtering them with machetes.* As many as 10,000 people were killed per day. Seventy percent of the Tutsi population was wiped out, and over 10 percent of the total Rwandan population.* Sexual violence was used as a weapon of war with up to 250,000 women and girls raped, resulting in thousands of births.* Hutus also released AIDS patients from hospitals in order to form ""rape squads"" to infect Tutsi women. As a result, thousands of survivors and their children born from rape are infected with the HIV/AIDS virus.* The genocide ended in July 1994 as the RPF, backed by Uganda's army, seized more territory and took control of Rwanda.* Fearing revenge attacks, about 2 million Hutus - both civilians and some of those involved in the genocide - fled to neighboring countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Tanzania and Burundi.* Human rights groups say RPF fighters killed thousands of Hutu civilians as they took power. The RPF denies this. * The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was established in Tanzania in November 1994 by the United Nations to prosecute those behind the genocide. * Over 90 people were indicted and, after lengthy trials, dozens of senior officials in the former Rwandan regime were convicted of genocide, all of them Hutus. Rwanda also set up community courts to prosecute thousands of low level suspects.

Ankara, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Turkey's opposition candidate for Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said Friday he was still winning by nearly 19,000 votes after the ruling AKP demanded a recount following Sunday 's tight election race .
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his AKP suffered an upset in local elections when results showed the party lost the capital Ankara and was narrowly defeated in Istanbul , the country's largest city and economic hub .
The two rival Istanbul candidates declared victory soon after the vote when initial results showed them in a dead heat. AKP appealed after electoral authorities later said Imamoglu had taken a very slim lead .
In an interview with Fox Haber broadcaster, CHP opposition candidate Imamoglu said the difference between himself and the AKP's candidate, Binali Yildirim, was now 18,742 votes.
He said nearly 120,000 previously annulled votes had been recounted in 17 Istanbul districts, with 2,184 extra votes being allowed for Yildirim, and 785 for himself.
Imamoglu estimated the final difference could finish between 18,000 to 20,000 once counting ended, probably by Sunday . Nearly 200,000 more votes still need to be recounted, he said.
""It should be over by the end of the weekend,"" he told the station.
The AKP has said the recount will show its candidate won.
Election authorities provide ongoing recount details to observers from both parties to ensure transparency. Political parties have until April 10 to challenge the results.
A defeat in Istanbul would be especially sensitive for Erdogan who made his political career as mayor of the city. The AKP or its predecessors had held both cities since 1994."

Kiev, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko and comedian Volodymyr Zelensky took drug tests on Friday ahead of their election runoff as the ex-Soviet country's presidential race becomes increasingly sensational.
Zelensky, a 41-year-old actor best known in for playing the president in a television show, is favourite to become Ukraine 's next leader after he dominated a first-round vote on March 31, despite many dismissing his candidacy as a joke.
Poroshenko, who is eager to make up lost ground before a run-off vote on April 21, invited his political novice rival to spar in an election debate.
Zelensky agreed but laid down a number of unusual conditions including a requirement for both of them to undergo medical tests to prove they do not abuse alcohol or drugs .
Zelensky also wants the debate to be held in the country's biggest sports arena, Kiev 's Olympic Stadium, which seats over 70,000 people.
- 'New traditions' - Poroshenko, 53, chose to play along, presenting himself to medics at a lab at the Olympic Stadium on Friday. He rolled up the sleeves of his white shirt and had his blood drawn in a video broadcast live on his Facebook page.
""We are creating new traditions,"" a smiling Poroshenko said during the procedure.
Doctors said they had also taken urine and hair samples.
Speaking afterwards, Poroshenko said proving that candidates do not have problems with substance abuse was a ""matter of national security"".
Volodymyr Yaryi, one of the doctors present, said the first results were negative.
Zelensky chose to undergo tests at a private clinic controlled by one of his supporters, rejecting Poroshenko's offer to take the tests together.
""I had my blood drawn, they drained me of all my blood . There's a lot of it, my young blood ,"" he said in an apparent jab at his older rival.
He said the results would be ready in three days. Zelensky stunned the country by winning more than 30 percent of the first-round vote , nearly twice that of Poroshenko who garnered almost 16 percent.
He has shunned traditional rallies, instead performing satirical shows and blurring the line between reality and fantasy.
The country of 45 million people -- which wants to join the European Union -- is mired in a smouldering war with Moscow-backed separatists in the industrial east.

ROME (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The path of armed conflict in Libya as well as unilateral military decisions will set back the prospects for peace and stability in Libya , Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in a statement on Thursday.
""I am following the developments in Libya closely and with concern. I believe that the only truly sustainable option is one that provides for a political process under the auspices of the United Nations ... Military options, especially unilateral ones, do not guarantee the implementation of responsible and long-term solutions ... The path of armed conflict can trigger an escalation of violence, which is targeted to delay achieving peace and stability, to which the Libyan people are fully entitled, rather than bring it closer,"" the statement said.
Conte noted that Italy continued to support initiatives of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who is currently visiting Libya in the run-up to a UN-organized conference in the town of Ghadames on April 14-16.
As a result of the country's years-long civil conflict, Libya has been left with no single central government � the country's eastern and western parts are controlled by separate powers. The Tobruk-based parliament , elected in 2014 and backed by the Libyan National Army , governs the east of Libya , while the UN-supported interim Government of National Accord, established in 2015 , controls Libya 's western parts from Tripoli .
In November 2018 , Conte organized a conference on Libyan settlement, which was held in the Italian city of Palermo and was attended, among others, by representatives of the two opposing Libyan governments. However, no significant progress was achieved by the participants, whose final declaration merely reaffirmed the countries' commitment to fight terrorism and resolve the Libyan crisis through diplomacy."

Iten, Kenya, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :As dawn breaks high in Kenya 's Rift Valley, car headlights pick out groups of elite athletes, mere silhouettes on roadsides as their grinding daily training routine gets under way.
Coach Lawrence Saina, himself a sub-2hr 10min marathon runner in his day, oversees nine of his Kenyan proteges, sending them out on a 40-kilometre (25-mile) run.
Hitting the tarmac under a wan rising sun, the athletes take advantage of the cardiovascular benefits from training at an altitude of 2,500 metres (8,200ft), which boosts oxygen-carrying red blood cells.
""Today, it won't be quick,"" said Saina, his charges still clocking mind-boggling speeds of 3min 42sec per kilometre, far removed from the average runner.
These are, after all , elite athletes: among the nine breaking sweat in the cool morning are Saina's younger brother Emmanuel, fourth in the Dubai marathon in January in 2hr 05min 02sec. He is due to race over the 42km distance in Rotterdam on Sunday .
After an hour the group head off the road into fragrant tea plantations, the breaking dawn sun finally lighting up the rock-strewn, and at times treacherous, red soil underfoot.
""When we go out for more than 35km in the morning, we don't do anything in the afternoon,"" said Saina of his training squad who live all year round, apart from when they go abroad for competitions, in Iten.
Bedrooms are shared, with two or four beds in each. There is a living area, kitchen and a rubdown room with two full-time physios working flat out to keep the demands of 20 elite runners in check.
There are dozens of similar camps up and down the Rift Valley, and they have churned out some of the best distance runners the world has ever seen.
One of those is Paul Lonyangata, who is aiming to become the first three-time winner of the Schneider Electric Paris Marathon when he takes to the streets of the French capital on April 14.
The 26-year-old's path to the peak of long-distance running has not been without its bumps."

Belgrade, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :A Serbian court on Friday sentenced four former intelligence officers to decades in prison for the 1999 assassination of journalist Slavko Curuvija, a fierce critic of late strongman Slobodan Milosevic.
The heaviest sentences, 30 years, were given to former secret police chief Radomir Markovic, who is already serving time for the killing of an opposition leader the same year, and Milan Radonjic, who was in charge of Belgrade 's intelligence branch, Beta news agency reported.
The court also handed 20 years to former intelligence officers Ratko Romic and fugitive Miroslav Kurak, who was sentenced in abstentia.
The four men were found guilty of having ""on the orders of an unknown person killed the journalist Slavko Curuvija,"" Judge Snezana Jovanovic was quoted by Beta as saying.
Curuvija was shot dead in front of his home in central Belgrade in April 1999, during the NATO bombing campaign against Serbia aimed at stopping its crackdown on the ethnic Albanian population in Kosovo.
At the time, he was the editor and owner of Dnevni Telegraf and Evropljanin, two of the leading independent publications in the country.
His family has accused Milosevic, who was notorious for efforts to cripple critical media , of personally ordering the killing.
Milosevic died in 2006 in a prison cell while awaiting a verdict in a UN war crimes trial for his role during the 1990s wars in Croatia , Bosnia and Kosovo.
More than a decade later, independent journalists are again facing threats and pressure in Serbia , whose current president, Aleksander Vucic, is accused of burgeoning authoritarianism.
Last year seven Serbian journalists were physically attacked and nearly 100 other media staff were threatened or put under pressure, according to the Independent Association of Journalists.
Reporters Without Borders dropped the Balkan state 10 spots in its 2018 Press Freedom index, citing an ""alarming number of attacks on journalists"" as well as ""collusion between politicians and media "".

Brussels, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The European Union warned German car giants BMW , Daimler and Volkswagen on Friday that a preliminary inquiry has concluded they colluded not to compete on emission control technology .
""As a result , European consumers may have been denied the opportunity to buy cars with the best available technology . The three manufacturers now have an opportunity to respond to our findings,"" EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.
The EU Commission has concluded that BMW , Daimler and the VW group -- Volkswagen , Audi and Porsche -- held so-called "" circle of five"" meetings to rig competition in emissions technology .
This allowed them to limit the introduction of ""AdBlue"" or urea to diesel engine exhaust gases, reducing its effectiveness as a way to produce cleaner emissions, the statement said.
The firms also -- ""in the Commission's preliminary view"" -- colluded to avoid or delay introducing OPF particle filters to reduce harmful particles in petrol exhaust fumes.
The findings form the basis of a ""statement of objections"" to which the firms will have a chance to respond before the Commission decides whether to pursue a case under competition rules banning cartel agreements.
A Damiler spokeswoman told AFP the firm was aware of the report but had already been cooperating with investigators and ""does not expect to receive a fine in this matter""."

Tokyo, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :A Japanese probe on Friday launched an explosive device at an asteroid, aiming to blast a crater in the surface and scoop up material that could shed light on how the solar system evolved.
The explosive mission is the riskiest yet attempted by the Japanese space agency's Hayabusa2 probe that aims to reveal more about the origins of life on Earth.
Hayabusa2 successfully released as scheduled the so-called ""small carry-on impactor"" -- a cone-shaped device capped with a copper bottom -- as the probe hovered just 500 metres (1,650 feet) above the asteroid Ryugu.
The impactor was programmed to explode 40 minutes later, propelling the copper bottom towards Ryugu, where it should gouge a crater into the surface of the asteroid that spins 300 million kilometres from Earth.
Hayabusa2 moved smartly away from the area to avoid being damaged by debris from the explosion or colliding with Ryugu while also releasing a camera to capture images of the event .
Images from a different camera at the bottom of the probe showed the impactor was released at the right position and angle.
Yuichi Tsuda, Hayabusa2 project manager, told reporters that the Japanese space agency (JAXA) was able to confirm the impactor hit the surface of the asteroid based on an image captured by the camera released by the probe.
""I think it's a success. We could not have asked for more,"" he said.
Takashi Kubota, an engineering researcher, said the probe's use of explosives and its ""acrobatic"" evasive manoeuvres were ""unprecedented"" and he hoped the mission would give scientists a rare peek inside an asteroid."

Islamabad (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News – 5th April, 2019) Pakistan Armed Forces spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor has schooled India after its claim of shooting down Pakistan’s F-16 proved wrong.
Taking to Twitter , the Inter Services Public Relations ( ISPR ) DG said that truth always prevails.
He added that India needs introspection, especially over atrocities in Indian held Kashmir.
“Allah be praised, truth always prevails. Time for India to speak truth about false claims & actual losses on their side including the second aircraft shot down by Pakistan . India needs introspection especially over atrocities in IOK. Region needs peace, progress & prosperity,” Major General Asif Ghafoor wrote.
India's claim that its fighter pilot shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet in a dogfight in February is wrong, Foreign Policy, a prestigious American magazine, said in a report quoting US defense officials.
""Two senior US defence officials with direct knowledge of the situation told Foreign Policy that U.S. personnel recently counted Islamabad 's F-16s and found none missing,"" the magazine said in a report published on Thursday.
India had claimed that in an aerial duel on February 27 - a day after its war planes dropped bombs in Balakot that Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman had engaged with one of the Pakistani fighter jets that targeted Indian military facilities and shot it down before he was hit and forced to eject.
Varthaman was captured by Pakistan Army was returned to India amid attempts to de-escalate the crisis between the two sides.
The Indian Air Force had on February 28 displayed pieces of the AMRAAM missile, fired by a Pakistani F-16, as evidence. But that, by itself, does not offer any clues on whether Varthaman had shot down a Pakistan Air Force F-16, as has been repeatedly claimed by the government and the IAF.
According to the Foreign Policy magazine, Pakistan invited the United States to physically count its F-16 planes after the incident as part of an end-user agreement signed when the foreign military sale was finalized.
""A US count of Pakistan 's F-16 fleet has found that all the jets are present and accounted for, a direct contradiction to India 's claim that it shot down one of the fighter jets during a February clash,"" correspondent Lara Seligman of the magazine reported.
The count has been completed, and "" all aircraft were present and accounted for"", an American official is quoted as saying."

The fire broke out late Thursday alongside a road in the town of Goseong, in the far northeast of the country and only around 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the border with the nuclear-armed North.
Fanned by strong winds it quickly spread through the mountainous area, incinerating 400 homes and 500 hectares of land, according to the government .
Nearly 4,200 people were evacuated and one person died , authorities said, while 35 were injured .
South Korean President Moon Jae-in visited the areas in Gangwon province most affected by the blaze, meeting with residents who were forced to leave their homes.
Moon and his staff wore yellow jackets, which symbolise situations of national emergency.
The president's approval rating hit a record low of 41 percent Friday over concerns about the economy.
He visited an elementary school in Goseong where evacuees were staying, and Jangcheon village, where many residential houses are reported to have burnt down.
""I hope you take extra care of displaced victims who -- after having lost their homes in an instant -- may now find time to catch their breath,"" Moon told fire officials.
The National Fire Agency said more than 870 fire engines and some 10,000 emergency personnel were dispatched to fight the blaze.
The military sent 32 helicopters, along with fire engines of its own and 16,500 soldiers, to help."

Berlin, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :A German far-right member of parliament , Markus Frohnmaier, could become ""absolutely controlled"" by Russia and act in Moscow 's interests, media reported Friday.
The BBC conducted a joint investigation into Russian documents together with the German magazine Der Spiegel, the German tv channel ZDF and the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
The documents dating from 2017 indicate that close allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin believed that Frohnmaier, elected to the Bundestag lower house in September that year, was very partial to their strategic interests.
They were sent by email on April 3, 2017 to a high-ranking aide in Putin 's administration calling for concrete ""support"" for Frohnmaier, 28.
The analysis describes Frohnmaier's chance of being elected as ""high"" and an assessment of his potential value to Moscow : ""We will have our own absolutely controlled MP in the Bundestag.""

Norway's $1 Trillion Sovereign Wealth Fund Is Dumping EM Bonds And Buying Stocks | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-05/norways-1-trillion-sovereign-wealth-fund-dumping-em-bonds-and-buying-stocks,"0 SHARES
Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund has already established itself as one of the world's preeminent marginal buyers of equities (behind maybe only the BOJ). So equity bulls will be delighted to learn that the fund has received permission from the government to boost its global-equity exposure to 70% of its AUM, just as global stocks have been powering back toward their highs from last year.
And to make room for its next round of price-insensitive purchases, the fund is planning to dump a sizable chunk of its EM bond holdings, as part of a broader overhaul of its fixed-income bond holdings. The decision, which was announced on Friday by the Norwegian finance ministry, which is responsible for managing the fund, comes after a year of deliberations.
The decision, announced on Friday by the Finance Ministry, comes after more than a year of deliberation. Bonds from Mexico, South Korea, Chile, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Malaysia, Poland, Russia and Thailand will be removed from the index, but the fund will still have leeway to invest up to 5 percent of its bond portfolio in emerging markets.
The move doesn’t go quite as far as the initial proposal from the fund, which called for whittling its bond holdings down to just three currencies: the euro, the dollar and the pound. Big currencies such as the yen, the Australian and Canadian dollar and the Swedish krona were spared. The ministry also rejected the fund’s wishes to cut corporate bonds.
The fund received approval to increase its equity exposure after arguing that carrying so much diversified EM debt doesn't make sense given the strength of the US dollar and the increasing correlation. Though the fund insisted it's decision shouldn't be interpreted as being bearish on EM.
""I understand this is a strategic decision,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of currency strategy at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. ""They change the benchmark. It’s not a sign that they get increasingly bearish on EM right now.""
He said that a shift of developed market central bank to ""to a longer (perhaps permanent)"" ultra-low interest-rate policy “should keep hunt for yields in general alive,” he said.
Strategists at Morgan Stanley said the fund would probably sell its emerging-market bonds over ""a prolonged period"" to minimize the market impact, and that the remaining 5% discretionary allocation will leave the fund with a $14.4 billion exposure to EM bonds, roughly half its exposure at the end of 2018.
Here's a breakdown of the fund's currency exposure:
Of course, depending on which JPM quant you believe , buying equities at these levels is either a smart short-term play or a terrible blunder. Tags "

Tokyo, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn will remain in custody until at least April 14, a Japanese court ruled on Friday, as prosecutors quiz him over fresh allegations of financial misconduct.
The Tokyo District Court said in a statement it had accepted a request from prosecutors to detain the 65-year-old auto tycoon for a further 10-day period that can subsequently be extended once more.
The ""full term of the detention is 14th"" of April , the court said.
Ghosn's lead lawyer Junichiro Hironaka appealed the decision, but the court rarely overturns its rulings.
Authorities are looking into new allegations that Ghosn transferred some $15 million in Nissan funds between late 2015 and mid-2018 to a dealership in Oman .
They suspect around $5 million of these funds were siphoned off for Ghosn's use, including for the purchase of a luxury yacht and financing personal investments.
Prosecutors say Ghosn ""betrayed"" his duty not to cause losses to Nissan ""in order to benefit himself."" Ghosn denies the allegations and says he is also innocent of the three formal charges he faces: two charges of deferring his salary and concealing that in official shareholders' documents, and a further charge of seeking to shift investment losses to the firm.

Moscow, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Zenit St Petersburg can take a huge step towards the Russian Premier League title when they visit defending champions Lokomotiv Moscow on Sunday .
Zenit, who are seeking their fifth league title, are six points clear of second-placed Lokomotiv and Krasnodar with 10 games remaining.
Sergei Semak's side lead their head-to-head record with Lokomotiv in the post-Soviet era with 16 wins, compared to the capital club's 14 victories, and the coach is keen to improve that record as he searches for Zenit's first league title since 2015 .
""In the recent matches we often started disorderly and conceded early goals,"" Semak told Zenit's website.
""We shouldn't repeat this mistake against Lokomotiv. They're a strong and well-organised team and it may be too costly to let them gain the lead ."" Semak added that he expected the Iranian 24-year-old forward Sardar Azmoun, who joined Zenit from Rubin Kazan in February and has since scored seven goals in the last seven matches, will be equally deadly in the upcoming encounter.
Lokomotiv are on a run of three straight wins and coach Yury Syomin said he was happy with his team's recent run of good form, which has given his team a chance to draw within three points of Zenit and retaining the title.
""Those who wrote us off after our unimpressive start into the season were too hasty,"" he said. ""We've played quality football in our recent matches to join title race .
""There's no doubt that the match with Zenit will be tough as both teams desperately need points. Hopefully, we will be ready for it."" Meanwhile, Spartak Moscow and CSKA Moscow will on Saturday clash for the 186th time in a derby that dates back to 1922.
Spartak boss Oleg Kononov said his team's 3-1 win over Akhmat Grozny gave him optimism for the clash with his cross town rivals.
""My team demonstrated excellent motivation and spirit in Grozny,"" Kononov said.
""Now we need to play in a similar way against CSKA. It's a very important game for both teams and I expect an uncompromising battle on Saturday."" CSKA chief Viktor Gancharenko said he expected his team to bounce back from a disappointing 2-2 home draw with struggling Ufa , in which the visitors leveled in the third minute of stoppage time.
""It's hard to accept this result ,"" Gancharenko said. ""We were in complete control for the majority of the game but in the very end Ufa punished us for our loss of concentration.
""Now we need to put this mistake behind us to prepare for the meeting with Spartak."" Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

No clashes have taken place yet, only a few minor attacks from gangs along the way [of the Haftar army divisions] to Tripoli ,"" the source said.
As a result of years-long civil conflict, there is no single central government in Libya , and the country's eastern and western parts are controlled by separate powers.

TAIPEI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :More than 58 percent of unmarried adult office workers in Taiwan have no plans to get married , and half of couples without children do not plan have them due to economic pressures and other reasons, according to a job website survey.
Job website Yes123 conducted an online survey of 1,304 adult office workers aged 20 or above in March , and collected 888 questionnaires from enterprises.
Unmarried respondents cited ""low income levels,"" ""difficulty to find the right person,"" ""can't afford to buy a house,"", ""want to live a free life,"" and ""insufficient saving"" as the main reasons for not entering marriage .
Demographic data showed about 135,400 couples got married in Taiwan last year, the lowest in nine years, while 181,600 new babies were born last year, the lowest in eight years.
Demographic authorities estimate Taiwan will see negative population growth in 2022 and become a ""super aging"" society by 2026. Its work force could be halved in 2065 from the level of 2018 .
Yes123 found 38.7 percent of office workers said they had children.
