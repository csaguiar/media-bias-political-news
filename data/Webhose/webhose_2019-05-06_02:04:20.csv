Too bad for this mom and the thousands of others, and I'm sorry for their families. But the people they tried to frame are people too, and more innocent, and I'm sorrier for their families; and the examples of a few paranoid moms would prevent far more other moms from following the same path."

In fact this woman probably knew it was false too, she was probably just a racist and thought she could get away with it. The problem with lamenting the popularity of such stories is that it leads to censorship. For example, Facebook is now banning anti-vax posts. But in fact many people oppose vax not because they believe in it but because they are just self-destructive trolls. Now the ban will only increase the popularity of the movement.

A man is in custody Monday night after an attempted abduction at the Huntington Mall in Barboursville.
That is according to Barboursville Mayor Chris Tatum, who says that the man tried to grab a child by the hair inside a mall store. The mother was able to startle the man, and he took off.
The mom later identified the man in the food court area, and he was arrested by Barboursville Police with help from Huntington Mall Security. The Cabell County Sheriff's Department was also on the scene to secure the perimeter.
Police are in the process of taking a report from the victims in the case.
Joe Bell, director of corporate communication with the Huntington Mall, said they're aware of the incident and praised the police response. Bell also said they're grateful no one was injured. I hope they throw the book at that guy!"

That's a little slippery. The specific example given involved a code or secret language presumably invented by the suspect, not an ordinary foreign language that many millions of people could translate.

Fisher is a case about document production, where the defendant was required to turn over evidence to the government. But assuming the government has the phone, and assuming arguendo that they can access the underlying encrypted data inside the phone, then the government already possesses all the evidence.
So the government possesses encrypted data. And Prof. Kerr claims that the government seeks to compel the defendant to perform an act that is non-testimonial (except as otherwise noted) that will result in the government having decrypted data. But of course the only way the defendant can help the government decrypt the data is by disclosing the contents of the password.
It would be nice if Prof Kerr could explain a little better why he thinks that forcing the defendant to disclose the password is not ""testimonial"" as to the contents of the password. Is it because entering testimonial data into a machine, as opposed to telling it to the government, is somehow different?"

DOJ Wants Up To Two Years To Reunite Families Separated At The Border,www.newsy.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsy.com/stories/doj-wants-up-to-two-years-to-reunite-separated-families/,"DOJ Wants Up To Two Years To Reunite Families Separated At The Border By Alec Larson April 7, 2019 April 7, 2019 The Trump administration is on the verge of what will be a painstaking process of combing through records to find separated families. SHOW TRANSCRIPT
The Justice Department has asked for up to two years to identify what could be thousands of immigrant children separated from their families at the border. That's according to court documents filed Friday.
The filing puts forth a plan for reunification that would involve first using data analysis and then painstaking manual reviews to comb through thousands of records.
The government has been under pressure to find all those who were separated.
Last June, a federal judge ordered the government to reunify families separated under the so-called ""zero-tolerance policy."" Then a government report in January revealed there were possibly thousands of other families affected. The report says many of them were separated before the announcement of the zero-tolerance policy.
The ACLU, which sued over family separations, responded quickly to news of the government's two-year plan, saying: ""We strongly oppose any plan that would give the government up to two years to find these children. The government's proposed plan reflects the Administration's continuing refusal to treat these separations with the urgency they deserve."""

I don't think that group heuristics are any deeper in our tribal bones than any other heuristics we commonly use. The interesting question - though it has a pretty obvious answer - is : how did those heuristics get into our bones in the first place ?
Self-assesment is one of humanitie's greatest powers, and we would do well to apply it to such.
It is easy to become arrogant and imagine that what we consciously analyse is all that is important. But it isn't - which is where the bones come in. Bones, like conscious analysis, are by no means infallible - particularly as we live in an environment that is significantly different from the ones in which our bones evolved. But a man who consistently scoffs at what his bones tell him is a fool. The same sort of fool as imagines that twenty minutes thought from his own head will come to a wise answer that has escaped all the other people who've been thinking about it for twenty years.

"With A Record Number Of Women Running For 2020, Why Is Media Focused On Men?",crooksandliars.com,Karoli Kuns,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/record-number-women-running-2020-why-media,"1 day ago by Heather Views:
Thank you, Joy Reid, for taking on the question of why it is that media is fixated on the men running for the Democratic nomination when there are a record number of women running, too.
As one small example of this, no Sunday show invited a female candidate to appear today, but Tim Ryan, Andrew Yang, and Pete Buttigieg were all guests on various shows.
AMJoy panelist Jason Johnson argued that the focus on white males reflects a lack of diversity in the media. ""Most reporters are white, and they're looking for a candidate that makes them feel good about themselves."" He also went on to say that Pete Buttigieg is a ""white, gay version of Cory Booker, but at least Cory Booker is in the Senate.""
Is it the polling that pushes these guys up for media focus? I'm not sure how that explains Andrew Yang, but maybe Joy has a point. Margaret Sullivan wrote about media coverage and why it's skewed toward the 'B-boys,"" who were at that time Bernie, Biden and Beto.
The horse-race model seems, as usual, to be out ahead by more than a few furlongs.
And so, we hear a lot about the B-Boys. In polling, in fundraising, in media ardor, they begin to seem inevitable.
Invincible.
Because Biden and Bernie, at least, are at the top of the polls, and have the highest name recognition.
Here's the takeaway from this long, must-watch discussion: It is time for media and Democrats to understand who the base of the Democratic party is and take them seriously, as Newsweek's Kwame Jackson lays out so well.
""We are at an inclusion inflection point and it's time to demand diversity,"" he declared.
""We are in 2020. America is no longer striving to be diverse, it is diverse and we must demand a diverse slate of candidates who represent us and you cannot look in this field in 2020 and say there are not diverse candidates who can step forward into the VP position or the Presidential position,"" he explained. ↓ Story continues below ↓
""So people who say that, look, we have to go to a white flight to safety in order to beat Donald Trump, that's a fallacy,"" he warned.
Indeed it is. And yet it is media's default. They are most comfortable with that which they know well: White men. It's why they minimize women candidates' accomplishments to build up the men, it's why they didn't cover Elizabeth Warren's fiery speech at National Action Network last week but raved about ""Mayor Pete's"" and it's why they obsessed on Joe Biden's touchy-feeliness all week at the expense of the women and people of color out on the campaign trail.
In Iowa, Warren, Harris, and Booker are wildly popular, but you'd never know it from the coverage. There's been more interviews with Andrew Yang than coverage of what's happening on the ground. Will media ever learn?
UPDATE: NYU Professor Jay Rosen is pessimistic :
Absent some kind of creative intervention , 2020 campaign coverage looks like it will be the same as it ever was. Who’s ahead? What’s it gonna take to win? The debacle in 2016 has not brought forth any dramatic shift in approach. Tags:"

AT&T's Randall Stephenson Attended Unscheduled Oval Office Meeting with Trump | Breitbart,www.breitbart.com,breitbart.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/04/07/randallstephensonwhitehouse/," Sanctuary Cities Plan Antisemitic Omar Brexit AT&T’s Randall Stephenson Attended Unscheduled Oval Office Meeting with Trump JOHN CARNEY 7 Apr 2019 AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, was an unexpected guest in the Oval Office Wednesday. Stephenson was not on President Donald Trump’s official schedule for the day and some top aides were not aware the meeting had occurred even after the fact, according to people familiar with the matter. Some were surprised that the meeting took place given that Stephenson made comments in 2017 that were largely interpreted as accusing the president of attempting to use the Justice Department to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time-Warner out of antipathy against CNN.
“There’s been a lot of reporting and speculation whether this is all about CNN,” Stephenson said at a 2017 press conference. “Frankly, I don’t know. But nobody should be surprised the question keeps coming up, because we’ve witnessed such an abrupt change in the application of anti-trust law.”
“We cannot and we will not be party to any agreement that would give even the perception of compromising the first amendment protection of the press,” Stephenson said. “So any agreement that results in us forfeiting control of CNN, whether directly, or indirectly, is a nonstarter.”
Stephenson was ushered into the Oval Office by Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic adviser, according to a person familiar with the matter.
One of the topics broached in the conversation was the administration’s 5G policy, a person briefed on the matter said.
