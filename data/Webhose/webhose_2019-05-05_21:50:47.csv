He'll forever be viewed as having performed a great service by equally longtime corrupt and even more-wealthy republicans. You think a corrupt, fraudulent pig like Barr cares about his reputation or his legacy any more than does the pathological liar, admitted serial sexual-predator, unashamed - in fact, proud - white supremacist and evil racist in the white house? Barr is proud of being a dependable henchman for the corrupt republicans, cares only about the money and prestige it brings him with privileged republicans, and cares not a whit about legacy or reputation or what anybody outside of that group of republican traitors and criminals he's been serving for 40 years."

And it’s not their job to air those people’s dirty laundry, or that of suspects outside of a grand jury room or a courtroom. ""Mueller concluded there wasn’t evidence President Trump colluded with Russia to hijack the 2016 election, and therefore no indictment was warranted. And he punted on the question of obstruction, leaving his bosses — Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein — to determine that there wasn’t enough evidence to indict the president on that charge. ""And, most significantly, there were no other people charged. That means Trump legally could not be named as an unindicted co-conspirator in an obstruction plot. ""At that point, no federal prosecutor has the right to impugn an uncharged investigative target’s reputation through anonymous leaks or literary reports. They are not allowed to anonymously inject into the court of public opinion any “damaging” information about what they couldn’t succeed at offering in a court of law as proof of criminality. ""Prosecution isn’t a game of horseshoes or hand grenades where prosecutors get to score points or inflict damage without indicting the target. In fact, the Founding Fathers built a legal system specifically to avoid the tarring of citizens when there wasn’t enough proof to meet a criminal charge."" https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/437496-note-to-team-mueller-if-you-dont-indict-you-cant-incite"

It was designed to play off the fact that we’re being played. I will tell you this: Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let’s see if that happens.The FBI, the Department of Justice, the Democrat Party. I don’t care where you go, there isn’t anybody that wants to do anything about Hillary breaking the law, violating the law, which has been documented by the FBI director, regarding her emails. Half of ’em are missing. She was trafficking in classified information. A woman who probably couldn’t get a security clearance today, is seeking the office of the presidency, and it matters. And yet nobody seems to be interested. So Trump throws out a line, “Maybe the Russians could find Hillary’s missing emails.” Why does anybody care what’s on those 30,000 emails anyway? It’s just yoga lessons and Chelsea’s wedding, her wedding registry. Isn’t that the stuff that Hillary said that she didn’t need to turn over to anybody ’cause that’s all that was on it, was Chelsea’s wedding, searching for XXXL yoga pants, boring personal stuff? Why does anybody care. There’s a meltdown all over the place over this, and it’s just hilarious to watch. When will fair-weather liberals, civil libertarians, and criminal defense lawyers return to our principles? Trump, Jr.'s meeting with the Russian lawyer to get damaging information on Hillary Clinton is protected by the U.S. Constitution, period. Did Donald Trump Jr. commit a crime or merely political sin? The first issue that must be addressed by Mueller is whether any existing criminal statutes would be violated by collusion between a campaign and a foreign government, if such collusion were to be proved? Unless there is a clear violation of an existing criminal statute, there would be no crime. Perhaps mere collusion by a campaign with a foreign government should be made a crime, so as to prevent future contamination of our elections. But it is not currently a crime. Repeating - You can’t include information under the Campaign Finance Law. That would be unconstitutional. ""Information"" cannot qualify as a ""thing of value"" that campaigns are legally required not to accept from foreign governments. It's something that's never been prosecuted. Liberals must be defeated not convinced"

"Female Astronauts: Performance Products Like Space Suits And SHOULD Be Designed For Women, Too",crooksandliars.com,The Conversation,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/female-astronauts-how-performance-products,"Susan L. Sokolowski , University of Oregon
On my first day of spring break, I woke up to way more emails than necessary and a flurry of activity on my social media. Acquaintances from near and far wrote about “patriarchy,” “NASA seems to have a history of lady issues” and posted emojis of sad faces and encouragement to my students to fix the situation.
The situation in question was NASA’s cancellation of an all-female spacewalk , citing the lack of a spacesuit in the right size.
I’m the director of the Sports Product Design Graduate Program at the University of Oregon, and equality in product design is my jam. Playing soccer as a Title IX athlete led me to the goal of my life’s work. Although we were breaking boundaries as female athletes, the products we wore were made for men and did not fit our bodies. There were no sport bras, so we played in the bras we wore to school with underwires and no sweat management. Although we were allowed and encouraged to play, we did not feel like we belonged. No one made products for us.
The news of the cancellation of the all-female spacewalk triggered a flashback to my childhood. Just when female astronauts were finally “allowed” to work together as a team, unchaperoned by male colleagues, a glitch in the product ecosystem ruined a landmark achievement. An all-female spacewalk has been a goal that women have been aspiring to since the 1960s. Jerrie Cobb, testing the Gimbal Rig in the Altitude Wind Tunnel in April 1960. The Gimbal Rig was used to train astronauts to control the spin of a tumbling spacecraft. NASA My path to product equality ↓ Story continues below ↓
My journey to become the best researcher and designer I could be began in high school. I wanted to create, size and fit products for the female body, helping women perform at their maximum potential. It has been a 30-year journey.
In college, I learned about designing for the female form. This included inventing new materials, studying the body anthropometrically physiologically , biomechanically and psychologically .
Learning about materials is important for product innovators, because they have so many levers – fibers, yarns, constructions and finishes – that can be manipulated to develop new technologies, like Nike FlyKnit, in which a knitting machine for manufacturing sweaters was engineered to make performance shoe uppers for athletes.
Anthropometrics is a discipline of human factors engineering that allows us to describe the body shape and size of different populations like men, women, children of specific ages and ethnicities; through circumferencial measurements of the areas like the chest, waist and hip; through understanding the volumes of various body parts like the torso; and through cross-sections – which helps designers understand how tissue is distributed in a specific region of the body like the breast.
Designers and engineers study physiology to develop product systems to regulate body temperature and biomechanics to understand mobility within apparel structures. We also study psychology – to understand how humans perceive attributes like color, touch and texture, which can greatly influence how acceptable a new product is for a user.
My university experiences provided an employment opportunity to work for the Department of Defense, just at the time when women were first allowed to fly in combat . I also spent about 20 years of my career working for a major sports company, leading efforts in women’s performance product innovation, including footwear, bras and equipment.
And now, I’m a college professor where I have students who are keen to invent new products for women . My student Jessie Silbert just completed a project designing gear for female Muslim runners . I currently have a student, Olivia Echols, who is working on her master’s thesis and designing new intravehicular activity suits for space station activities , which includes determining how products should fit for women. My colleagues have also worked for NASA. They do care about women and the future of spaceflight for women, and like me, they are dedicated to gender equality. So, if you were ever thinking there must be a lack of people that care or have the talent to do the work – there isn’t. Olivia Echols identifies issues with the regular Earth-bra that must be overcome to design the ideal space-bra for female astronauts. Olivia Echols/Susan L. Sokolowski , CC BY-ND Women’s bodies are different
Researchers, engineers and designers who create performance products for women have many considerations. The most obvious is body shape and size, where product innovators will study the female population in question through 3D body scanning, anthropometry and statistical analysis of the data. The results of this type of research affect how product patterns are drafted, materials are engineered and how technology is placed around the body, so users can perform jobs safely and efficiency.
Because women have physiological differences, product solutions need to consider how body temperature fluctuates and muscles develop due to hormones. In footwear design, we think about making sure products are flexible and that the cushioning is engineered to the appropriate load, because women are relatively lighter than men in weight. Olivia Echols’ final design of the space bra. Olivia Echols/Susan L. Sokolowski , CC BY-ND Sorry, we have budget constraints
In my opinion, the issue of not having enough spacesuits on hand lies within what I call the product ecosystem. Despite the efforts made researching and developing innovative performance products for women, our work may never be fully funded, implemented, manufactured and therefore adopted by women, as the ecosystem surrounding our work may not want us to succeed. Most often budgetary decisions for research and development happen outside of the creation team.
As an example, NPR’s “All Things Considered” revealed that all-male astronauts fit into medium, large and extra-large sized spacesuits, and due to budget constraints, the development of smaller sized suits for women was put on hold for several years, preventing women from walking in space.
These financial decisions often come from outside the product research and creation teams, and those decision-makers are often men. Considering representation of women at the CEO level, only 4.2% of all Fortune 500 CEOs are women. NASA may not be a Fortune 500 company, but gender disparity certainly exists in the U.S. government .
Budget constraints have always been a way for others to say “no” to supporting efforts that product creation teams dedicate to women. The message really says we don’t want women to be successful or perform to their greatest potential. “No” says you don’t belong, because there is there isn’t any appropriate gear for you. Don’t apply to this job, because you may be putting yourself in a dangerous situation if you wear products that were made for average men. Making equipment for only one segment of the population denies access to others. Serg036/Shutterstock.com
This is not just a NASA or sports industry problem. The same challenges exist for female firefighters , law enforcement officers, construction workers and those who work with hazardous materials.
And this is not just a women’s problem. As I have progressed through my career, I have encountered so many other underserved users who need our help. There are nonwhite users who have anthropometrically different body dimensions than white men, such as Hispanics and Asians. Some users are disabled or require plus sizes. Gear should accommodate Muslims who aspire to be active while respecting their religion.
In the recent NASA incident, there was a correctly sized suit for astronaut Ann McClain. However a decision was made to not prepare it in time for the first-ever all-female spacewalk. McClain trained in and wore both a size medium and large. That is probably because her body changed sizes while in space due to micro-gravity. McClain told the press that she made the “recommendation” to not do the space walk. But why was there not a better product placement strategy and leadership support for Ann McClain? NASA, you broke our hearts.

Less Is Moore: Unseemly Details Continue To Emerge About Trump's Fed Nominee,crooksandliars.com,Scarce,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/more-unseemly-details-emerge-about-trumps,"By Scarce
Trump wants to put Stephen Moore on the Federal Reserve Board, a once hallowed institution that normally has people on it with the utmost experience and expertise in economics and the monetary policy of the United States. Trump, on the other hand, wants this media gadfly and political hack there. Ill-suited and eminently unqualified, more details are emerging from just-released divorce filings and tax issues that point to what can charitably be called ""character issues."" Stephen Moore is what is colloquially known as a scumbag.
Source: Washington Post
Stephen Moore, President Trump’s planned nominee for the Federal Reserve Board, was found in contempt of court in 2013 for failing to pay his ex-wife more than $330,000 in alimony and child support, court documents show.
A court in Fairfax County, Va., ordered Stephen Moore to sell his home in order to pay his ex-wife, Allison Moore, the money he legally owed her but had failed to pay for months. Stephen Moore ended up paying $217,000, although only after the court sent several police officers, two realtors and a locksmith to his home to change the locks and prepare the property for sale, records show.
Allison Moore told the court the payment was enough that she no longer wanted to force her ex-husband to sell the home.
Stephen and Allison Moore, who have three children together, were married for two decades before divorcing in 2011. Allison Moore began divorce proceedings in 2010, and her divorce complaint said her then-husband opened a Match.com account and had a mistress. ... The contempt of court was first reported by the Guardian. Allison Moore then petitioned to seal the records. The divorce records were unsealed Friday after an appeal by The Washington Post, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Guardian.
Stephen Moore appeared on TV and radio shows this week accusing the media of trying to derail his nomination by dredging up a messy divorce and a $75,000 tax lien against him stemming from an error on his 2014 tax return.
A few days ago, Steve Benen at Maddowblog summed it up best, stating that nominating the woefully unqualified Stephen Moore shows that Trump's nominees are getting worse, not better. ↓ Story continues below ↓
All of which suggests Trump, by choosing Moore for the Fed board, is actually regressing.
But even putting that aside, Stephen Moore isn’t just another unfortunate selection for the amateur president. He is a uniquely ridiculous choice – quite possibly the least defensible of the Trump presidency to date.
To say it’s difficult to know where to start with Moore’s c.v. is to be quite literal. It matters, obviously, that he’s not an economist and knows very little about what the Federal Reserve does. But it also matters that Moore has been wrong about practically everything for many years. It matters that he appears to be a Trump sycophant. It matters that Moore has had a hand in some spectacular economic failures. It matters that Moore’s economic opinions tend to echo Republican talking points while “flying in the face of economic theory.”
It matters that Moore has a reputation for misstating basic factual details. It matters that his economic views tend to vary based on the party of the president at the time. It matters that the White House has made the finance industry nervous with this nomination. It matters that actual economists have been apoplectic about Trump’s selection of Moore, (One scholar argued, “This is truly an appalling appointment. An ideologue, charlatan, and hack. Frankly so bad the putatively serious economists in Trump administration should resign as matter of honor.”)
It matters that Moore has embarrassed himself on television over and over again. It matters that Moore, at the height of the Great Recession, turned to “Atlas Shrugged” as an economic guide. It matters that Moore’s own finances are a mess – why the White House refuses to vet its nominees in advance is a mystery – owing $75,000 in unpaid federal taxes, interest, and penalties.
Slate’s recent summary struck me as notable: “Stephen Moore is a living embodiment of the sucking intellectual void at the core of conservative economics, an inept pundit who has spent his career evangelizing the supply-side dogma that tax cuts pay for themselves while shilling for Republican officeholders, all from well-paid perches at think tanks and in the media.”
Trump has made some bad nominations, but this one belongs in its own category. Even Senate Republicans should recognize that the president has gone too far this time – but they probably won’t. Tags:"
