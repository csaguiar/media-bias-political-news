The only reason its been SOP from most Presidential candidates, is because they were trying to move from one public office to another, and are trying to demonstrate that they haven't been profiting from the office they currently hold.
None of that applies to Trump, since he was a private citizen who never held public office before running for POTUS.

He continued, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt regret calling out this president for deeply unethical and improper conduct. Not a bit. I think the moment we start to think that we should back away from exposing this kind of malfeasance and corruption is a dangerous point.‚Äù
He added, ‚ÄúThere is a risk when you have an immoral president, a president lacking in basic character who violates the norms of office, an even greater risk of doing too little oversight. I make no apologies for that. I‚Äôll continue holding this administration accountable.‚Äù

Takeaways from Tibor Nagy‚Äôs Visit to La Republique du Cameroun - BaretaNews,www.bareta.news,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.bareta.news/takeaways-from-tibor-nagys-visit-to-la-republique-du-cameroun/,"Takeaways from Tibor Nagy‚Äôs Visit to La Republique du Cameroun
Bernard Ngalim America‚Äôs Undersecretary of State for Africa, Tibor Nagy, recently rounded up a brief trip to some African countries including La Republique du Cameroun (LRC). Prior to his visit to LRC, Tibor Nagy granted interviews in France and South Africa signaling his mission to LRC will center on the Ambazonian liberation conflict. Irrespective of America‚Äôs geopolitical interest and the fight against Boko Haram, the Ambazonian liberation struggle has become the most important security, humanitarian and human rights issue between Washington and Yaound√©. Importantly, Washington considers Ambazonians as a people with the right to self-determination.
Barely a month before Tibor Nagy‚Äôs visit, the US Departments of State and Defense significantly reduced military aid to LRC. Though no specific details were released on the this military sanction, the US applied Leahy Laws which oblige the American government to terminate military relations with any partner country whose military grossly violates human rights. According to CNN , ‚Äúthe US intends to ‚Äúterminate‚Äù over $17 million in security aid, including funds for radars, four defender-class patrol boats, nine armored vehicles, training programs for C-130 airplanes and helicopters and the withdrawal of an offer for Cameroon to be a candidate for the State Partnership Program .‚Äù This demonstrates Washington has enough evidence that LRC military is seriously engaged in excessive human rights violations including ‚Äú targeted killings , detentions without access to legal support, family, or the Red Cross, and burning and looting of villages .‚Äù
In addition to suspending military aid, the Undersecretary raised the possibility of referring the Ambazonian conflict to an international forum . Though he did not mention any specific international forum, there is high probability the United States may refer the conflict to the Security Council of the United Nations. Washington demonstrates the gross violations of human rights now warrants an international humanitarian intervention. Though LRC will object on grounds of territorial integrity and state sovereignty, international law and practice have developed to the effect that humanitarian considerations trump state sovereignty . Evidently, Washington is fully aware that LRC has lost control of the Ambazonian conflict and cannot singlehandedly regain such control. Similarly, it is equally possible that Washington has recognized Ambazonia‚Äôs determination and capability to repel LRC.
Also, Washington like other international players notably the African Commission on Human and Peoples‚Äô Rights assert that Ambazonians have the right to self-determination. By consistently referring to Ambazonians as ‚Äú Anglophone population ‚Äù and calling for both sides to dialogue without pre-conditions, Washington recognizes Ambazonian legitimate right to self-determination under international law. Importantly, Tibor Nagy understands the current armed conflict is ‚Äúa long-term historical crisis that goes back decades. It goes back to the union of the two parts of Cameroon . It goes back to the fact that the anglophone population of Cameroon have felt like second-class citizens for a long time.‚Äù By highlighting the ‚Äúunion‚Äù of the two Cameroons, Washington understands an international boundary separates the Ambazonia from LRC and the two countries represent different ‚Äúpeoples‚Äù under international law .
Interestingly, despite the military aid and personnel training offered to LRC recently, Tibor Nagy compares the Ambazonian conflict to the Vietnam war. He expressly warns LRC to remember that despite having a well-trained Army and using sophisticated weapons, America lost the Vietnam war. Aware of LRC‚Äôs military prowess, Washington raises this important element for possibly three significant reasons. First, LRC‚Äôs military arsenal and financial resources cannot sustain a long-term guerrilla warfare because Washington demonstrates more fact-based reasoning. Tibor Nagy understands the Ambazonian population supports Restoration Forces against LRC. Second, Tibor Nagy‚Äôs failure to outrightly condemn the constitution of Restoration forces indicates Washington recognizes Ambazonia‚Äôs right to self-defense. Thirdly, Washington understands the conflict is totally provoked by LRC and the people of Ambazonia identify with Ambazonian liberation movements acting in their defense.
Importantly, Tibor showed great mastery of the conflict. Three of his declarations are worthy of note. Reacting to claims that Ambazonians living in the USA are sponsoring terrorism in LRC threatening to destabilize LRC, Tibor requested LRC supplies names of suspects and if Washington finds any compelling evidence that the accused have violated American Laws, American Courts will try them. This assertion outrightly flattened LRC‚Äôs claims that the USA will immediately return political activists to LRC. Unfortunately for LRC the USA is a state of law and the executive complies with judicial decisions. Besides the significance of the rule of law, Tibor referred to Restoration fighters as ‚Äú Amba Boys ‚Äù- a name commonly used in normal parlance in Ambazonia. Also, Tibor confessed he receives daily reports with images of gross human rights committed daily.
Conclusively, American diplomatic conversations around the Ambazonian conflict proves America is the only super-power interested in resolving the conflict and protecting human life in Ambazonia. Fundamentally, Tibor Nagy‚Äôs declarations represent the American perspective and demonstrate America has a perfect understanding of the Ambazoninan conflict. It is equally compelling to note that LRC‚Äôs narrative and attempt to sell the Ambazonian revolution as a ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù movement and an internal affair did not gain traction. The easiest solution to the Ambazonian conflict lies in revisiting the decolonization process, asserting Ambazonia‚Äôs right to external self-determination and recognizing Ambazonia‚Äôs independence in compliance with laws and resolutions organizing decolonization. As mentioned above, this conflict has been in the making for decades but caught international attention when it transformed into an armed conflict. Its armed nature projected the necessary force to call the world‚Äôs attention to the sufferings in Ambazonia. Some Ambazonians hold that Restoration forces have put them on the map of international issues and they must maintain and increase their stake militarily before negotiating terms of separation with LRC. They contend that negotiations at this point will disadvantage Ambazonia because Ambazonia will negotiate from a position of weakness. As true as this maybe, Ambazonian leadership must act in compliance with international law, understand the international political system and learn from previous liberation struggles like the Ambazonian"

The images were taken about 470 km (292 miles) above the moon. Israel is the seventh nation in the world to successfully enter the moon‚Äôs orbit. Doing so entails a complicated maneuver in which the spacecraft must hop from earth‚Äôs orbit to the moon‚Äôs ‚Äî as seen below in a demonstration video released by SpaceIL.

The team are hoping the lander will touch down near Mare Serenitatis, or the Sea of Serenity, which is on the near side of the moon.
Beresheet needed to decelerate from 8,500 kilometers per hour (5,280 miles per hour) to 7,500 kilometers per hour (4,660 miles per hour) in order to successfully enter lunar orbit.
Of the seven nations that have entered the moon‚Äôs orbit, only the U.S., Russia and China succeeded in landing on the moon. The others lost control and crashed on the moon‚Äôs surface.
If the April 11 landing goes smoothly, it will mark the first privately-funded moon-landing.
‚ÄúThere is a significant chance we have a crash landing,‚Äù said Opher Doron, the space division general manager at Israel Aerospace Industries. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very dangerous, and it‚Äôs difficult to predict if we‚Äôll succeed.‚Äù

A U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Air and Marine Operations (AMO) aircrew assisted in the rescue of the injured agent. Nogales Station agents began tracking a group of ‚Äúsuspected narcotics smugglers‚Äù through the mountainous terrain west of Nogales, Arizona, on Thursday afternoon. A National Guard UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter aircrew operating under Operation Guardian Support provided aerial support for the search/interdiction operation, according to information obtained from CBP officials.
As the agents approached the location of the alleged smugglers, a short foot-pursuit began. The agents apprehended the three men and determined they were all Mexican nationals with no legal authorization to be in the U.S. The agents found six large bundles of marijuana with the illegal aliens, officials stated.
While the agents carried out the arrests, one agent fell 15 feet and sustained injuries to his head and extremities. Tucson Sector officials dispatched an AMO helicopter aircrew to hoist the agent out of the canyon and transport him to an awaiting ambulance. Other agents stabilized the injured agent prior to the airlift.
The ambulance transported the un-named Border Patrol agent to a local hospital where doctors treated his injuries. The doctors released the agent to recover at home.
Nogales Station agents seized the 286 pounds of marijuana and arrested the three Mexican nationals. The agents transported the illegal aliens to the Nogales Station for processing. They could face federal smuggling charges in addition to immigration violations. Officials did not say if any of the migrants had previous criminal or immigration violations.

We need to pay close attention, as over time, this could be just as catastrophic to humans as it is to insects. Special attention must be paid to the principal drivers of this insect decline, because while climate change is adding to the problem, food production is a much larger contributor.
The report , released by researchers at the Universities of Sydney and Queensland and the China Academy of Agricultural Sciences, concluded that 40 percent of insect species are now threatened with extinction, and the world‚Äôs insect biomass is declining at 2.5 percent a year. In 50 years, the current biomass of insects could be cut in half. Such a sharp decline could trigger a ‚Äúcatastrophic collapse of nature‚Äôs ecosystems.‚Äù

State lawmakers are working on a bill that could effectively bailout the state‚Äôs two nuclear power plants. A piece of draft legislation would create subsidies, rewarding nuclear for not emitting carbon. Listen / 0:47
The proposal crafted by Republican Representative Jamie Callender would allow a new charge on electric bills.
The unofficial language would cap those new charges per month at $2.50 for residential customers, $20 for commercial users, and $250 for industrial users.
Callender‚Äôs office reiterates this is only a rough draft, saying there‚Äôs already a new rendition of the bill drawn up so details are expected to change.
Nuclear power has been struggling in the energy market against cheaper natural gas and stiff competition from other sources.
FirstEnergy Solutions, which used to be a subsidiary of FirstEnergy and owns Ohio‚Äôs two nuclear plants, has filed for bankruptcy but says it‚Äôs also pursuing legislative relief.

What's interesting here, in particular, is that explosion happening after the fire had burned for some time - the benign version I'm thinking of there, is a gas container in an apartment that has its gas pipe blocked for non-payment or because it's officially unoccupied...
In general, though, if it IS terrorism, it's done in a remarkably incompetent manner, so I'm thinking that incompetence is a definite part of the picture, whether it's terrorists or general idiots..."

Virginia guard Kyle Guy sank three free throws after a late foul call with 0.6 seconds left to seal a 63-62 victory over Auburn. The Cavaliers will play in their first national title game in program history one year after suffering a huge first-round upset in last year‚Äôs NCAA tournament.
Virginia became the first top seed to lose to a No. 16 seed in the first round of the tournament.
The Cavaliers (34-3) also earned the top seed in their region this year, and were the only No. 1 seed in the Final Four.
Ty Jerome led the Cavaliers with 21 points, nine rebounds and six assists. Guy had 15 points, four assists and three boards in 39 minutes. De‚ÄôAndre Hunter added 14 points and five rebounds.
Fifth-seeded Auburn (30-10) rallied from a 10-point deficit in the last five minutes and grabbed a four-point lead. Guy drained an off-balance three to trim the lead to 61-60 with 7.6 seconds remaining. The Cavs immediately sent Auburn‚Äôs Jared Harper to the free throw line.
Harper made one free throw to boost the Tigers‚Äô lead to 62-60. With 1.5 seconds left, Guy received the ball in the corner and fired a 3-pointer. Samir Doughty, with his arms extended straight up, appeared to bump into Guy‚Äôs hip during the shot.
The long ball clanged off the rim and the PA announcer in U.S. Bank Stadium announced the Tigers as the winners. Instead, officials awarded Guy with free throws because he was fouled. He made the first two freebies to tie the game and Auburn head coach Bruce Pearl called a timeout to ice him. Guy proceeded to sink the game-winning shot.
Doughty led Auburn with 13 points in 28 minutes. Bryce Brown had 12 points, three assists and three boards. Anfernee McLemore had nine points and 12 rebounds, while Harper added 11 points.
Meanwhile, Texas Tech also clinched its first trip to the national title game with a 61-51 win over the Spartans.

Buttigieg blasts 'hypocrisy' of evangelicals for supporting Trump,thehill.com,Michael Burke,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/437737-buttigieg-blasts-hypocrisy-of-evangelicals-for-supporting-trump,"Buttigieg blasts 'hypocrisy' of evangelicals for supporting Trump By Michael Burke - 04/07/19 10:50 AM EDT
Buttigieg, who is a Christian, said during an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that Trump ""acts in a way"" that is inconsistent with what he hears in church. ADVERTISEMENT
""It‚Äôs something that really frustrates me because the hypocrisy is unbelievable,"" he said of evangelical support for Trump. ""Here you have somebody who not only acts in a way that is not consistent with anything that I hear in scripture or in church, where it‚Äôs about lifting up the least among us and taking care of strangers, which is another word for immigrants, and making sure that you‚Äôre focusing your effort on the poor.""
""But also personally how you‚Äôre supposed to conduct yourself,"" he added, saying that Trump is at odds with a religion that calls for ""humbling yourself before others.""
Buttigieg added that he's surprised conservative Christians support Trump despite the fact that he was ""caught writing hush money checks to adult-film actresses,"" a reference to payments Trump's attorney made during the 2016 campaign to quiet allegations by Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal that they had affairs with Trump. ""Even on the version of Christianity that you hear from the religious right, which is about sexual ethics, I can‚Äôt believe that somebody who was caught writing hush money checks to adult-film actresses is somebody they should be lifting up as the kind of person you want to be leading this nation,"" Buttigieg said. Buttigieg's remarks come after he said last week that it's hard for him to believe that Trump believes in God. ""I'm reluctant to comment on another person's faith,"" Buttigieg told USA Today . ""But I would say it is hard to look at this president's actions and believe that they're the actions of somebody who believes in God."""
