The use of the term ""unfortunate"" in this present situation is an affectation meant to convey personal self reliance and a willingness to carry a certain burden. It is meant to downplay the extent of personal impact. I believe the use of this idiom became popular after WWI. It was adopted by certain members of the leadership class who saw how nobly their fellow citizens has persevered in that meat grinder of a war. The term ""stolen valour"" comes to mind.
NonMuslim children are being raped by lying Muslims all over Britain. This is not a situation of a broken rudder on the ship of state. It is not a ""misfortune"". The British Government not only knows that this rape jihad is underway but actively conspires to keep the public ignorant of the extent of this crisis while ensuring ever more Muslims enter the nation. That is not an accidental policy choice. This is not ""bad luck"". This is a deliberate policy. Statecraft has been hijacked by people dedicated to steering the ship over rocky shoals.
Look up Ireland 2040 if you doubt that this is a conspiracy by many agents in the West. The only uncertainty in my mind is whether the dreams behind this are Utopian or just vengeance against the collective body of Europe."

SDP proposes Non-Open Market flats to address HDB's 99-year lease crisis,yoursdp.org,SDP,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://yoursdp.org//news/sdp_proposes_non_open_market_flats_to_address_hdb_39_s_99_year_lease_crisis/2019-04-06-6292," 6 Singapore Democrats Non-Open Market, or NOM, flats that do not include land costs in their price should be introduced into the public housing system in Singapore. This idea was raised at the SDP's launch of its housing policy Housing A Nation: Holistic Policies For Affordable Homes . Party Vice-Chairman, Mr John Tan, and Treasurer Mr Bryan Lim presented the landmark policy paper this afternoon. Such a scheme would resolve the problem over the depreciating value of HDB flats due to the 99-year lease of the land. National Development Minister Lawrence Wong caused a stir in 2017 when he said that “As the leases run down, especially towards the tail-end, the flat prices will come down correspondingly.” Singaporeans have expressed much concern over the matter as many hope to sell their flats at a profit that they can use for retirement. “But depreciating values, especially of ageing flats, mean that owners cannot depend on their flats as a nest-egg,” Mr John Tan said during the launch. “The problem is compounded by the fact many Singaporeans have depleted their CPF savings to pay for their flats.” The NOM scheme will price new HDB flats to include administrative, material, labour costs only but without land “cost” that is currently the practice. As a result, prices of flats will be substantially lower, ranging from $70,000 for 2-room flats to $240,000 for 5-room flats or even less. “As the name implies, however, flats bought under this scheme will not be allowed to be re-sold in the open market,” co-presenter Mr Bryan Lim said. Owners wishing to dispose of their NOM flats will have to sell them back to the HDB, he added. Singaporeans who purchase these flats can expect to take 9 to 15 years to pay off their housing loans (based on an interest rate of 3 percent) using no more than 20 percent of their gross income. This further reduces the financial burden of home-buyers many of whom currently service their loans on a 30-year basis. The lowered housing expenditure will free up capital for homeowners to save for their retirement. The rationale for NOM flats, Mr Lim pointed out, is that the government should not profit from Singaporeans when it comes to public housing and Singaporeans should not use it as a means of investment for capital gain. Public housing is a social good and should be used to meet the housing needs of the population, not profit-making for the government or citizens. Current homeowners Existing HDB owners can continue to sell their flats in the open market (OM). Of course, they are subjected to the vagaries of the prevailing market. However, those who wish to take advantage of the NOM scheme can convert the status of their existing flats. In such a case, the government will return the difference between the original price of their flats (as purchased from the HDB) and price of an equivalent NOM flat subject to a cap. This money will be credited back to the owner's CPF account or used to pay any outstanding housing loan that one may have taken. The converted flats will then be subjected to rules governing NOM flats. The NOM scheme essentially gives Singaporeans an added option of buying a home at a greatly reduced price. First-time HDB buyers can choose to buy an OM or NOM flat. Ensuring a stable housing market The NOM system will be introduced in a gradual manner to prevent a shock to the existing system and a sudden market correction. This will provide stability to the OM prices while making NOM flats affordable for those who want it. The market correction of prices will take place in a gradual and measured way that will not cause financial distress to current homeowners. Other policy initiatives presented by the SDP include: 1. Implementing the Young Families Priority Scheme (YFPS), a targeted priority scheme that grants balloting priority for first-timer families with children or couples who are expectant for Balance Flats or new Built-To-Order Flats in non-mature estates. 3. Enhancing the Lease Buy-Back Scheme to more effectively assist needy senior citizens to have a secure retirement. 4. Barring Permanent Residents and non-citizens from buying or renting NOM flats. Collectively, these SDP policies can contribute towards resolving some of the major problems affecting public housing in Singapore today and ensuring that our public housing system is compassionate and inclusive.

This Faith Leader Sees Climate Change as a Moral Emergency,www.motherjones.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/04/mariama-white-hammond-faith-leader-finds-the-common-ground-to-address-a-moral-emergency/,"This Faith Leader Sees Climate Change as a Moral Emergency Boston’s Reverend Mariama White-Hammond believes we can work together. Cara Giaimo April 6, 2019 6:00 AM Rev. Mariama White-Hammond (right) joins her mother, Rev. Dr. Gloria White-Hammond (left), in song and prayer during a women's conference at the Jubilee Christian Church in Boston on May 5, 2017. Craig F. Walker/The Boston Globe via Getty Images Looking for news you can trust?Subscribe to our free newsletters.
This story was originally published by Grist and is shared here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.
Last winter, a few dozen scientists and faith leaders walked into the Archdiocese of Boston headquarters in Braintree, Massachusetts, to talk climate change. The meeting took some time to find its footing—after all, these two camps don’t always speak the same language.
“There was a lot of enthusiasm,” recalled Dave McGlinchey, the communications and government relations manager of the Woods Hole Research Center, which co-hosted the meeting. “But it wasn’t really focused.”
Then the Reverend Mariama White-Hammond cut to the chase: Faith leaders and scientists may come at the issue of climate change from different angles, but they share an understanding that it is a moral emergency. “She spoke so compellingly,” McGlinchey said. “She connected the conversations in a really concise way.”
A year later, the policy advocacy group—now called the Faith Science Alliance for Climate Leadership—is delivering its message to the public and politicians, with a mission statement distilled from her short speech.
White-Hammond, a 2019 Grist 50 member , has a knack for finding common ground. In addition to being the pastor of the New Roots African Methodist Episcopal Church in the Boston neighborhood of Dorchester, she is also a devoted activist, a prolific board member, and an in-demand speaker for ecological and justice events in the state and beyond. She uses these platforms to reinforce less-than-obvious connections—and to help her forge new ones, whether between economic and environmental concerns, underserved communities and clean energy providers, or faith leaders and scientists.
“People are like,‘You’re a minister! How does all this work?'” she said about connecting faith to, well, you name it. “But to me, faith is about living what I believe in, in every sphere of my life.” If she can demonstrate how all of those spheres overlap, she thinks, she can help the rest of us get there, too. Both Bostons
White-Hammond grew up in a household that aimed to change the world. Her parents, the Reverend Ray Hammond and the Reverend Gloria White-Hammond, are both community leaders as well as ministers, deeply involved in social justice and philanthropy. Her father is a former chair of the Boston Foundation, one of the nation’s wealthiest community trusts, and is a trustee of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum; her mother is on the board of Tufts University and has been heavily involved in anti-genocide activism, particularly in Darfur.
“By choice, my parents raised us in the inner city of Roxbury at a really challenging time in Boston’s history,” the Reverend Mariama White-Hammond said. That was when black communities were so underfunded and ignored by the city that they considered secession . Growing up in that time and place helped create a bond with her struggling neighbors, she explained, even as she attended an elite and mostly white private high school.
That experience of having a foot in two different worlds taught her to move easily between disparate communities. She spent more than a decade as the director of Project Hip-Hop , helping local youth make art about everything from street violence to deportation. For a while, though, environmental problems didn’t make the cut. “I had the mentality, ‘Let wealthy white people work on that!'” she recalled. “Watching the natural disaster of the storm, and then the unnatural disaster of the racism and xenophobia and classism that followed, really concretized in my mind the deep connection between those two things.”
Then Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast. “Watching the natural disaster of the storm, and then the unnatural disaster of the racism and xenophobia and classism that followed, really concretized in my mind the deep connection between those two things,” she said.
She was always engaged in politics—in 2006, she was a ward coordinator for then-Governor Deval Patrick’s re-election campaign. But helping out in New Orleans after the storm led her to realize there might also be a place for her in the ministry. Social justice is a large part of the African Methodist Episcopal, or AME, religious tradition, and White-Hammond’s strengths—particularly her warm, sincere presence, and commanding voice—lend themselves to the pulpit. In 2014, she went to seminary, and until recently was the ecological justice minister at the church her parents lead, Bethel AME in the Jamaica Plain area. She originated the position, which involved encouraging worshippers to understand their own relationships with the natural world and to fight its degradation.
In 2016, thanks in part to her efforts, the national AME church, which had never before weighed in on the issue, passed a resolution that highlights how climate change disproportionately affects communities of color. She’s in regular demand as a speaker, but for her the most important engagements are those that bring her in front of people who might not see themselves as part of the climate movement, including young people, low-income people, and people of color. She hopes to reach 10,000 youth this year, and, so far, is on track. Finding the connection
Connecting these issues in the way she does can expose problems—and reveal new opportunities. A few years ago, White-Hammond worked on an initiative to install solar panels on the roofs of several local churches, including Bethel AME, where she was ministering. She got the congregation on board, worked with other faith leaders, and helped bring in solar installers who hire people of color.
They planned to sell back some of the extra power their panels generated in order to recoup overhead costs, and donate the rest of it to community members. Then, more than a year into the process, a change in state law slashed the price of solar power, reducing the amount of money the churches would receive. A couple of congregations dropped out, and the remaining ones could install only about half as many panels as they’d originally envisioned.
It was evidence of what can happen when people in power don’t recognize the relationships between different forms of oppression, she said. Nonetheless, the project helped her bring a whole new group of people into the movement, and she believes they’ll stay active. “If people can start seeing solar on their roof, and feel like they’re part of the green energy revolution, they’re going to engage on the next thing, right?” she said.
After the churches invited two local politicians to the ribbon cutting, White-Hammond and other organizers began working with them to reverse the worst effects of the recent law change. The Green Justice Coalition , a labor and environmental partnership that White-Hammond is a part of, has made solar energy access for low-income people the focus of its 2019 campaigns. And White-Hammond now advises Sunwealth, the investment firm that helped fund the church panels, on how to find similar projects.
In the little free time White-Hammond has, she likes to keep up her own relationship with the earth through her vegetable garden—which is, wisely, in a community plot, with neighbors who are happy to help water her plants. “If I had to maintain that garden on my own, it would be a disaster,” she said. “But because I do it with others, it works.” FACT:

Earlier this week, Lisov and his daughters arrived in Warsaw and were taken into police care after it was found that the three girls had been reported as missing in Sweden.
Swedish authorities offered to take the girls back to Sweden but police did not release them. The next day, Lisov applied for asylum along with his daughters and Polish judge Żaneta Seliga-Kaczmarek ruled that the girls could stay in Poland with their father.
“The court can not issue minor children outside the territory of the Republic of Poland, where they entered under the care of their father,” the judge said.

“After hearing the minors and in the absence of a document confirming limitation of the rights of the father, the court decided that bearing in mind the broadly-understood well-being of minors, they should be left under the care of their father,” the judge added.
“Speaking to me, they indicated that they want to be with their dad, love their dad, and do not want to part with him,” she added.
Bartosz Lewandowski, the lawyer for Lisov and his family, slammed Swedish authorities after a man shouted something in Swedish to the girls before they gave their testimony to the judge. “This shows how the Swedish services manipulate children,” he said.
The case echoes a similar situation in the United Kingdom in which a five-year-old Christian girl was placed into care with an allegedly hardline Muslim family, despite protests from her family.
It was alleged that the girl was forced to remove her crucifix necklace and that Arabic, which she did not understand, was spoken around her frequently.

Paul D’Emilia, today a successful Manhattan lawyer, shares fond memories of 20 years ago, from his assignment as the US Legal Resident in Tirana
Interview by Ruben Avxhiu Paul D’Emilia ( demilialaw.com ) is a New York City based attorney specializing in the fields of international law, criminal defense, estate matters, business consulting, real estate, private investigations and general counsel work. His client base also includes numerous overseas companies and foreign individuals that have various business and personal legal matters pending in the U.S. Mr. D’Emilia is a co-founder of a law practice in Europe that specializes in US expatriate issues.
You are today an accomplished lawyer who, divides the time between your offices in Rome and New York, but in January 2000, you were involved in a very different line of work, selected by US Dept of Justice to become Resident Legal Advisor to the U.S. Embassy in Albania. How did this assignment happen? Why were you chosen for it? What were your professional interests at the time?
In 1999 I was working as an Assistant District Attorney in Brooklyn. At the time I had become a Chief in the office and was supervising and training the younger Assistant DAs. I was contacted by the United States Department of Justice regarding a new position that would be established in Tirana when the US Embassy was re-opening. As a long-time prosecutor in New York City the Department felt that I would be a good selection to help train and reform the Albanian Prosecutor General’s Office, at that time being headed by Arben Rakipi. I accepted the assignment as Legal Advisor to the US Embassy and immediately transferred to Tirana.
What were your expectations of Albania? Had you ever heard of it before? How did you expect the assignment?
I admit that I did not know very much about Albania when I was first interviewed for the job. Regardless, I accepted the assignment immediately. After the announcement I was bombarded with people telling me to refuse the offer since Albania was a “lawless” place and that I would be in constant danger. I remember landing at the Tirana Airport in a driving rainstorm, very dark and gloomy. We taxied to a stop and the door to the plane swung open. As I stepped out of the plane and onto the stairs the sun burst out. I took that as a very good omen.
It seems that you played an important role “with the task of reforming and restructuring the criminal justice system of Albania”. What do you remember from the situation in the country in those years? What were some of the problems the system in Albania was facing then? My impression was that Albania was emerging from a brutal period in its history. Even the US Embassy had been shut down for almost two years after the discovery of an Al- Qaeda cell operating in the country, and the uncovering of a plan to attack the embassy. I was part of the first wave back into the country upon the embassy’s reopening. The prosecutors were mostly young and inexperienced but enthusiastic to establish credibility and make a positive impact. Prosecutor General Rakipi was a quiet and serious leader of his office, working through a severe lack of resources and cooperation from other government officials. I was able to organize seminars with US Justice officials both in Albania, throughout Europe and even back in the United States. The prosecutors and government officials that took part in these trainings absorbed everything like sponges. It was impactful both on a practical as well as a cultural level.
What do to you remember from your time in the country, the daily life, the everyday people, etc.?
I was fortunate because almost everyone spoke Italian. I was able to dispense with translators. I also dismissed my around-the-clock security detail after my first week of being in the country. I felt safe and respected by the Albanians. I saw a genuine affection for the US by the people of Albania. They’re optimistic and hard workers. I’ve always said that Albania would be our perfect 51st State- they should forget the European Union and join us! With US Ambassador Limprecht, in his office, in Tirana, Albania.
You were in charge also during the proceedings that implemented the first successful extradition from Albanian to the United States in history. Do you remember that case? Can you describe it somehow for our readers?
It is one of my prouder achievements.
I had come across an Interpol communique that named a suspect in a homicide in New York City from the year before. There was a suspicion that the suspect had fled to Albania. I did a records search and utilized some local sources which discovered that the same man was being held in a Tirana prison on a minor charge and was due to be released in the next 30 days.
I knew extradition would be a problem since very few countries are willing to extradite their own citizens to face prosecution in a foreign country.
I was able to find a treaty signed by King Zog from the early 1900s that allowed this extradition to the United States. I brought the case to the Supreme Court of Albania which upheld the validity of the treaty and signed off on the extradition.
I arranged for marshals from New York to travel to Albania and effected the handover of the suspect from the local prison to the waiting jet to take him back to New York. This all happened in the weeks after September 11. It was a needed distraction for me.
I was in the courtroom in lower Manhattan some months later when the defendant was found Guilty of the murder and sentenced to 25 years to Life in prison. Paul D’Emilia, during his years in Tirana, Albania.
How long did you stay in Albania and how important is your service over there when you think of the accomplishment throughout your career in law?
I ended staying two years in Albania. I think we made some real progress, at least in changing the approach and belief in the ability to have a functioning and corrupt-free national Prosecutor’s office.
Fast forward to our time, Albania is again involved in hot debates about a major justice reform. Many judges and prosecutors are tainted by corruption. There is now in place a vetting system to weed out those who may have been compromised by crime and bribery. What would you advise, in principle, the people in the legal profession and state officials involved with the reform?
Progress, not perfection.
You will never be able to eradicate corruption, fraud, bribery, etc. – we see that today in the US as politicians, judges, and public officials are indicted almost daily.
What’s important is to have a system in place that holds officials accountable and lets the citizens know that its institutions are stable and that crime, when uncovered, will not pay.
Make the foundation strong and society will survive the storms.
You have an office in Rome as well as in New York. Both metropolis have sizeable of Albanian immigrant communities. Have you had any case involving them? Albanians in New York are entrepreneurial; many have their own businesses, while others are successful professionals. What kind services they may find in your office?
We handle the entire spectrum of legal services to the community: from criminal defense, personal injury, real-estate and any civil matters.
The Albanian community continues to grow and become more successful, so they need to be treated with the same professionalism and high-quality representation. I always have available Albanian and Italian seeking staff to make the experience more user-friendly and to better utilize my 25 years of legal experience.
Visitors who have been in the country in the early 2000s and now speak of huge progress, especially from the point of view of a foreign tourist or short-time-visitor. Have you ever returned to Albania after the end of your work there? Any plans to travel? I have returned to Albania occasionally over the years. It is a dizzying experience since the country seems to undergo such rapid change in such short periods of time. I still remember being one of the first cars on the “new” road that took us from Tirana to Durres in half an hour. I always try to arrange a visit to the many fantastic places I discovered almost 20 years ago, from Shkodra to Saranda. Perhaps my next visit will be back to the US Embassy…
Would you advise it to young lawyers to get involved in similar work experiences abroad? Would you do it again, if you were somehow sent back in time and why?
It was the most rewarding experience of my legal career. It should almost be mandatory for young lawyers to accept an assignment abroad. It opens your eyes to the rest of the world and teaches you valuable skills to utilize the rest of your life. Not only would I do it all over again, but
I would stay even longer if I could.
