Scouted: These Bed Frame Styles Will Help You Kickstart Your Bedroom Makeover,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.grudo@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Grudo),04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bed-frames-guide-from-panel-to-platform-and-headboard-to-storage,"Scouted By The Beast
We spend so much time in our beds that it’s important to build our bedrooms with intention — and bed frames both determine the function of various mattresses available to you and go a long way in establishing your room’s aesthetic.
We’ve covered sleeping habits extensively (Scouted staff takes its Zs seriously), including advice for light sleepers , mattress shoppers , the sleep masked , the bedroom accessories-obsessed , air purists , and, of course, snorers .
In my own search for a perfect bedframe this spring, I put together some of the highest rated frames I came across that stood out to me as great examples of the styles I’m contemplating.
Beverly Bed in Ivory , $1,295 at One King’s Lane: Simple and minimal, this panel bed allows for your mattress to include a box spring. Its iron framework is hand-finished in gold and the padded upholstery trim cushions you for bedtime reading or late-night (or weekend or anytime) TV watching.
Darcey Cast Iron Metal Bronze , $495 at Pier 1: The headboard and footboard combo doesn’t have to be huge and overwhelming. This cast iron style is comprised of an iron tube frame and rounded corners. The antiqued golden finish and the sparse design lets this piece accent a room based on traditional, romantic, or rustic decor.
Roselawn Upholstered Platform Bed , $358 at Wayfair: Low to the ground and majestic in appearance, the platform bed is similar to a panel bed but lets you throw a mattress directly on it without the need for a springboard. The gray of the Roselawn and its upholstery mean there are few styles it won’t complement, and the elegant styling will elevate your bedroom’s feel (and touch).
Nexera’s Tribeca Storage Bed , $653 at Target: Storage beds are very necessary for some of us and very nice to have for others. Either way, it at least makes sense to make use of the space under your bed if you’re not going for a simplistic aesthetic. And the Tribeca does a great job in maintaining minimalist looks while concurrently providing three reversible storage drawers that you can install on either side of the bed. The headboard further includes two storage spaces, one on each side, for books, Kindles, or phones.
Poundex Louis Phillipe French Style Sleigh Platform Bed , $775 on Amazon: The sleigh style (so-called because its backward curving headboard is styled in a way reminiscent of a sleigh) works best in a luxurious aesthetic. And when the occasion arises, outfitting your bedroom to match can really elevate the entire room and even enhance the calm you’ll experience entering it. The way I see it, a luxurious sleigh bed feels like a sturdy antique, solid and unwavering, supporting your sleep and wildest dreams. This highly-rated French style comprises a deep and attractive cherry wood.
If you’re looking to level up your bedroom this spring, starting with a frame that matches the aesthetic and style you want to achieve is a foundational step in your journey.

Republican Jewish Coalition Has to Remind Trump: We Didn’t Support Obama,www.thedailybeast.com,Emily.Shugerman@thedailybeast.com (Emily Shugerman),04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/republican-jewish-coalition-has-to-remind-trump-we-didnt-support-obama,"Republican Jewish Coalition Has to Remind Trump: We Didn’t Support Obama “How the hell did you support President Obama?” Trump asked the GOP audience. 04.06.19 5:35 PM ET Ethan Miller/Getty
Addressing a crowd of American Jews Saturday, Donald Trump repeated one of his favorite attack lines against former President Barack Obama, saying he had ruined America’s economy and decimated the military. “How the hell did you support President Obama?” he asked the audience. “How did you do it?”
The only problem was, they didn’t. Trump was addressing the annual conference Republican Jewish Coalition, a powerful lobbying group backed by GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson . The audience members quickly reminded the president they had not supported his Democratic predecessor.
Trump’s speech was meant to drum up support from American Jews—a voting bloc that has traditionally voted Democratic. The president has attempted to shift this allegiance in recent years, granting the Israel government political favors like sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights region. He has also thrown his support behind Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is up for re-election next week.
On Saturday, Trump occasionally appeared to confuse the American Jewish audience with Israelis, calling Netanyahu “your prime minister” and saying Democrats “very well could leave Israel out there all by yourselves.”
“I know that the Republican Jewish Coalition will help lead our party to another historic victory,” Trump said. “We need more Republicans. Let's go, so we can win everything.”
Trump returned several times to the idea of Democrats betraying Jewish voters. Earlier in the speech, he mocked Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who has previously expressed disdain for the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC. The president offered a sarcastic “special thanks” to Rep. Omar before adding, “Oh, I forgot, she doesn't like Israel. I’m so sorry.”
The remark came less than a day after a New York man was arrested for threatening to kill the congresswoman . According to a criminal complaint, the man told the FBI he “loves the president” and “hates radical Muslims in our government.” A representative for Rep. Omar did not respond to a request for comment.
Saturday’s gathering was protested by the progressive Jewish organization IfNotNow, which opposes the Israeli occupation. Ten protesters stood up in the back of the room and chanted “Jews are here to say, ‘Occupation is a plague.’” Their intention was to encourage the Jewish community to reject Trump, Netanyahu, and the RJC, according to a press release.
The group’s cries were drowned out by RJC members chanting “USA” and “Four more years.” As one of the protesters was removed from the room, Trump remarked, “He's going back home to mommy and he will be reprimanded.” READ THIS LIST"

Student in Viral Border Patrol Video: University Caved to Pressure to Punish Me,www.thedailybeast.com,kelly.weill@thedailybeast.com (Kelly Weill),04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/denisse-moreno-melchor-student-in-viral-border-patrol-video-university-of-arizona-caved-to-pressure-to-punish-me,"exclusive Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast
At first, the University of Arizona was helpful. “I got a call from the Dean of Students Office,” Denisse Melchor said. “They’re like, ‘Are you okay, we’ve been receiving so many threats naming you.’”
Then a local Border Patrol union leader started lashing out against her on the radio. Now Melchor and another student are facing criminal charges, brought by the University of Arizona’s own police force .
Melchor, 20, and fellow student Mariel Bustamante, 22, became the center of a media firestorm last month, after a viral video showed students protesting Border Patrol agents at the University of Arizona. This week, the school charged both students with “interference with the peaceful conduct of an educational institution,” for which they face up to six months in jail. In a letter to students, the school’s president accused the young women of infringing on “free speech” rights with their alleged protest.
But Melchor said she’s the one facing a threat to her free speech. “I feel like this is an attempt to silence me,” she told The Daily Beast.
Video of the protest shows a student criticizing two Border Patrol agents through an open classroom door, where they are speaking to the university’s Criminal Justice club. The student calls the agents “Murder Patrol,” and other students take up the chant later as the agents get into their car. As the video racked up views in conservative media, Melchor began receiving threats, and at first, the university offered assistance, she said.
But a relatively neutral statement on the incident from the university’s student government drew the ire of a local Border Patrol union. In a Facebook statement, the union called the protest an “attack” on “Caucasian students.”
National Border Patrol Council Vice President Art Del Cueto took the provocation further. In a radio interview, he told listeners to “send me the names of the actual illegal aliens at the school and their addresses and I will be glad, on behalf of the Border Patrol union, to send any type of information when agents are going to be at their school.”
After the union and Del Cueto began their offensive, the university changed its attitude, Melchor said.
“After del Cueto started coming out and putting pressure on the school and UAPD [University of Arizona Police] to investigate, it’s like the Dean of Students went silent with me and stopped checking in.”
The university pushed back on the claim. ""To my knowledge, the dean of students continues to work with the students,"" a university spokesperson told The Daily Beast.
Melchor described the school as unequal in its treatment of disruption on campus. She cited the case of “Brother Dean Saxton,” a hate preacher who made a name for standing on campus screaming obscenities about women and LGBT people.
“We all remember Brother Dean Saxton,” she said. “He’d yell at people walking by, at women, saying ‘you deserve to get raped,’ saying people who wear leggings deserve to get raped. He’d sit out there for hours, yelling and yelling. They let him get to the point where he kicked someone in the chest. ”
In her case, however, Melchor has had to hand over her phone to university police, and has not received it back nearly a week later. A school detective told her its return “‘could be days, could be weeks, could be months.’ That’s my only form of communication. I’m a student living in Tucson, my family lives in another city,” she said. “I feel like they’re just using intimidation tactics.”
She said the investigation won’t stop opposition to Border Patrol on campuses like hers.
“This has been something people have been fighting before, since before I was even thinking about going to college,” she said, citing three Mexican teenagers who were fatally shot while standing in Mexico, by Border Patrol agents standing on the U.S. side.
“The presence of Border Patrol on campus is traumatizing for students; it’s triggering for students. The safety of students and their ability to be in an education environment where they can continue their studies comfortably should be the number one priority for the university.” READ THIS LIST"

More than 50 refugees and employees told NBC News there is a system of rampant corruption within the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR. Refugees in Kenya, Uganda, Yemen, Ethiopia and Libya described paying up to $3,000 per person in bribes to UNHCR officials in order to resettle in another country. Others said they were forced to bribe officials for everything from food rations to contacting the police. Three staff members said they were fired after speaking up about the exploitation, while suspected perpetrators were allowed to resign or move to another location rather than being investigated.

Martinique: Oprah Is Right About This Small Caribbean Island,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/martinique-oprah-is-right-about-this-small-caribbean-island,"IT’S STILL A BIG WORLD Oprah Is Right About This Small Caribbean Island Come to Martinique for the rum, stay for the ruins and the yole boat rides. Maybe leave speaking French? David Giral / Alamy
“Wait, there’s only one all-inclusive here?”
I had just arrived at the French Caribbean island of Martinique with very little idea of what to expect. As the daughter of a major cruise-loving family, who also happen to be Puerto Rican, I visited at least nine different islands over the course of my adolescence. But aside from everyone speaking French, its amazing rum and Oprah really liking it —I knew close to nothing about Martinique or the French Antilles.
I (falsely) assumed the things I’d see and do would be akin to the other islands I’ve been to—including mainly interacting with the turquoise water and endless mai-tais . So the news that the island only had one all-inclusive (Club Med) in the southernmost part of the island—on purpose—threw me for a loop. But my guide Géraldine Rome (who also happens to be the Martinique Tourism communications coordinator) told me that’s exactly how the island wants it.
“It’s a conscious decision,” she says as we ride together in the back of our tour van. “We want you to meet Martinique and it’s people. It’s another type of tourism.”
In other words, it’s OK to relax here. There’s plenty of places to do so and rum to consume. But there’s also opportunities to immerse yourself in the Martinique French and Creole culture—and it’s highly encouraged.
Just a few minutes later I started to see what Rome meant. Looking out the window on the way to our first destination, up the eastern coast from the from the capital of the island to the very northernmost tip, I observed no less than one out of every three people headed to work, school, or running errands with a baguette in tow—a remnant of the cultural influence of France, which colonized the island in 1654 . Tourists could be spotted here and there, but there seemed to be no other distinction between the life of those on the island and the visitors exploring among them.
We arrived at the village of St. Pierre, which sits in the shadow of the dormant volcano Mt. Pelée. I had been speechless only once before on my travels, after spotting the Colosseum in Italy for the first time. Seeing this majestic volcano standing proud and unbothered among the luscious rainforest in the northern part of this island marked the second time. But unlike the Colosseum, tourists don't overtake the area. We were actually the minority, making a stop at the ruined remains hidden among the town where locals casually went about their business—baguettes and all.
They didn’t seem bothered by this huge volcano in their backyard, but as someone who loved seeing Mt. Vesuvius and Pompeii, I was enthralled. Referred to as a “Little Pompei,” visitors have full access to the ruins from the devastating 1902 eruption , one of the worst in the world. Our second guide, André, showed us the spots where an entire theater and prison had been destroyed, telling the infamous tale of the lone prisoner who survived in one of the cells.
Hours later, and after a rum factory tour and the first of many incredible rum tastings at the northern Depaz Distillery, we made our way to a restaurant called Le Petibonum that is, like most places in Martinique, frequented by tourists and locals alike. Located in the coastal village of Le Carbet, which is conveniently located on the way back south from St. Pierre, the restaurant sits under a large wooden canopy for shade just a few steps away from the beach. A tiki bar was nearby, ready and able to make any drink of your choosing, including the local “Ti Punch” rum drink, that’s actually a shot of rum with a cup of sugar cane juice on the side.
When you’re ready to be seated, you get the unique pleasure of meeting the chef, Guy Ferdinand a.k.a. Mr. Hot Pants, who proudly sports a pair of very short jean shorts. He’s the kind of guy that would be an excellent guest cook on Guy Fieri’s Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives —he’s funny, a bit zany, and in love with his home island and food. And on top of all of that, he’s an incredible chef.
I don’t eat fish. But at Le Petibonum that changed. Fried cod fritters, a staple appetizer on the island, became my new-favorite food. And that’s coming from someone who peels the skin off of hot wings. The main dish was blue marlin served with a vegetable covered in cheese that somehow tasted better than a potato. I ate every last bite. But if for some reason you aren’t as much of an adventurous eater, don’t fret. I spotted the biggest, most delicious burger I’ve ever seen at the table diagonal to where I sat.
As Rome laughingly told me, “Martinique is all or nothing!”
Throughout the week my tour group and I continued the theme of culture and leisure, getting beach time on those amazing bathwater beaches, but also living like a local. What truly impressed me was the seemingly endless activities that we could do on this island that would take no more than 2 hours to travel across. In no particular order, here are just a few of the sites we visited: Rum distilleries The Le Jardin de Balata botanical garden Le Tombolo (a place in the sea where the water recedes enough to create a walkway from the shore to the neighboring island) The Habitation Clement and its Arts Foundation (which has a full-fledged sculpture garden) La Savane des Esclaves
I tried to joke to someone on my tour that Martinique was the island to make everyone happy—from your snorkeling-obsessed uncle to your art-loving cousin—but it really is true. The rum distilleries, with tasting stations, are the perfect combination of history and alcohol-tasting excursion. The botanical garden that sits, literally, in the middle of the rainforest will knock the socks off of nature lovers.
Le Tombolo, located in the village of Sainte-Marie, is the must-see spot for travelers on the hunt for those once-in-a-lifetime kind of experiences (and sights.). And the sculpture garden at Clement featured historical and political elements that will leave art lovers feeling accomplished on their vacation. I was personally drawn to the huge piece that spelled out “blood” in red letters, hinting at the island's colonization by white settlers in the 1700s.
There’s even La Savane des Esclaves , which is a beautiful outdoor, living museum dedicated to telling the history of the slaves that colonists brought to Martinique.
For those looking for a truly authentic adventure, I recommend choosing a “yole boat” tour as one of your water excursions. Yole boats are a traditional type of row boat only found in Martinique. Each person sits on the side of the boat as one person steers. To turn, each person must alternate between sitting on the edge of an oar. Every year locals hold races and we happened to go on the yole boat trip with one of the best competitors on the island.
Most importantly, to me anyway, was the food. It did not disappoint, especially if you’re a seafood lover. Seriously, Martinique people love their fish. If you come here, you will too—even if you’re not a seafood lover, there’s a 90-percent chance you will become one. In two days, I had tried 12 new kinds, from sword fish to cod to sea urchin, and they were all amazing.
In addition to Le Petibonum in the north, I was absolutely impressed with the food at Zanzibar, which is conveniently across the street from Le Tombolo in the south. You’d think with all the focus on amazing fish, that the island would someone lack in the dessert department, but that was not the case. I’m a huge sugar addict and finding sweets here was high on my priority list. The french toast dessert at Zanzibar made my foodie heart sing, and an incredible photo for my Instagram page .
Because I couldn’t take that home, I opted to bring back the go-to Martinique dessert called amour caché, which is a kind of pound cake that you can get with guava, coco, or creme underneath. Our yole boat captain shared some with us after we docked for a bit and I fell in love. I purchased a box from a local bakery in the island’s capital and more city-like area of Fort-de-France— then proudly stuffed it into my carry-on and safely brought it back to my kitchen in New York.
Now, I have to give credit to where credit is due. I visited that all-inclusive Club Med, and it seemed everything like it should be. Blue waters. Snorkeling. Lounging by the water as waiters bring endless food and drinks to you. There’s no shame in a relaxation game. But if you have the chance to escape, do it. Do it all, the way Martinique wants you to. Lots of fun, history, fish, yole boats, and a Chef Hot Pants await you. READ THIS LIST"
‘The Haunting of Sharon Tate’: Inside the Crazy Hilary Duff Movie That Desecrates the Dead,www.thedailybeast.com,amy.zimmerman@thedailybeast.com (Amy Zimmerman),04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-haunting-of-sharon-tate-inside-the-crazy-hilary-duff-movie-that-desecrates-the-dead,"‘The Haunting of Sharon Tate’: Inside the Crazy Hilary Duff Movie That Desecrates the Dead There are no words. But we’re going to try. [Warning: Spoilers] 04.07.19 3:01 AM ET Saban Films
The Haunting of Sharon Tate is a movie about fate. Tate, played by Hilary Duff, is kept awake at night by visions of her impending death. Just like the Haunting audience, Tate knows that her murder is inevitable. It happened years ago— a semi-random, terrible slaughter orchestrated by Charles Manson and his cult family. What Manson conceived of at the time as deliberate chaos is now just history—a horrible thing that happened because an evil person willed it into being. Sharon Tate’s death did not usher in the apocalypse, and Charles Manson died in prison. It’s a tragic, pointless story, and it’s the one that Sharon Tate will always be remembered for. The Haunting of Sharon Tate imagines a world in which the actress’s death, and therefore her legacy, was narrowly avoided, imbuing the star with the foresight and agency to predict and prevent her own murder.
Director Daniel Farrands’ conceit reportedly traces back to a tabloid’s claim that Tate had a premonition that she would die a full year before the Manson family invasion. The image of an ill-fated starlet plagued by visions of a disturbing future is a vivid one, but one that a basic sense of courtesy and propriety would prohibit most people from converting into a feature-length film. It’s a thought experiment best suited for private contemplation: a young Sharon Tate pregnant with premonition, bewildered and terrified, as a vision of Lizzie McGuire star Hilary Duff playing her in a poorly written 2019 snuff film flashes before her eyes.
Throughout the film, Tate repeatedly wonders if fate can be tampered with, or if we’re all “slaves to our own destiny.” The Haunting of Sharon Tate marks a fate so strange, unpredictable, and cruel that no one ever could have seen it coming—but someone probably could have, and should have, stopped it.
Tate’s sister Debra has deemed the film “classless,” and that lack of support from the murdered subject of the film’s family really says it all. Watching an unauthorized Sharon Tate film makes you feel just about as icky as you’d expect. Rather than attempting to alleviate the inherent grossness of dramatizing a vile murder, The Haunting of Sharon Tate leans right in, all jump scares and unapologetic snuff-film vibes. Not content to just ratchet up the scary soundtrack and run right through the prop blood supply, the film’s premise demands that the audience watch the murders over and over again.
In The Haunting of Sharon Tate , the Valley of the Dolls actress arrives at her Benedict Canyon home 72 hours before her death. She becomes increasingly distracted by nightmares and visions, which are dotted with waking clues. There are strange envelopes from “Charlie,” a guy who’s been coming around the house looking for an old tenant. Tate learns about Charlie’s followers, his “family,” and her rapidly increasing paranoia is triggered by a dead dog and two waifish, wide-eyed girls who come too close to her on the walking trail. Naturally, her live-in friends Abigail Folger (Lydia Hearst), and Wojciech Frykowski (Pawel Szajda) think she’s going insane (although Abigail does concede that they’ve been having some weird people over, and smoking some pretty dank weed). Tate’s husband, Roman Polanski , is off working on a film, but Sharon is convinced that he’s having an affair. She creeps around the property in set loops, from the nursery to the window, from the bedroom to the door. Sometimes it’s a nightmare, running through the particulars of her death over and over again. Then suddenly she’s awake, a hand on her stomach, with a distantly-vexed expression suggesting physical discomfort but also, I would like to think, the pain of reciting such horrible dialogue.
When she isn’t randomly waxing on about fate and chance, Tate is awkwardly teasing her ex Jay Sebring (Jonathan Bennett) with totally normal comments like, “Well you didn’t become stylist to the stars by just running your fingers through their hair,” or she’s hilariously whispering “Damn you, Roman!” to an empty bed. As the spooky situation continues to devolve, Tate repeats a number of warnings and unconvincing, stock-scared responses like, “Something is very wrong inside this house”—understandable, coming from a woman who’s been dying for three days, but not very conducive to the pure-terror vibe the film is clearly going for.
This wooden acting, and the relationships that come off as fake and far-fetched as the plot they’re cycling through, are all consequences of a film that prioritizes cheap scares over convincing characters. At the end of the film, when Tate’s premonitions finally come true, she’s run through them so many times that she knows how to stop it. She fights back, stabbing and cursing out her assailants, and lives to haunt her own fate.
In one of the final scenes, a bloodied Tate returns to her house the morning after, seemingly on another plane of reality—she sees the cops, the corpses, the newspaper headlines. She walks away from all of it. But this show of agency, after a night of very spirited self-defense, is undermined by the Tate who we see onscreen. Duff plays the young actress as a tragic Hollywood starlet—not a pregnant, terrified, and totally exasperated human being. She’s vacant and beautiful, with permanently pursed lips and a knockoff Christian Louboutin accent (fancy, expensive, but just off). Occasionally sounding inexplicably British is about the only interesting thing that Duff’s Sharon Tate does. Scary dreams do not a multi-dimensional character make. Starring in a movie that epitomizes our grotesque cultural obsession with dead girls, Tate comes across as a pretty projection. The film about defying fate finds Tate relegated to her perpetual post-mortem role of tragic enigma. Sharon Tate might as well be a ghost in her own life story, for how little we see of her here."

Jason Sudeikis busted back onto the show in a cold open sketch that found the former vice president undergoing sensitivity training following a week in which he was repeatedly accused of inappropriate behavior with women over the years and awkwardly tried to dismiss those allegations with a series of jokes.
“You guys know that I’m a tactile politician, right?” Sudeikis’ Biden asked his campaign staffers. “I’m a hugger, I’m a kisser, and I’m a little bit of a sniffer. The last thing I ever want to do is offend anyone.”
With that in mind, they brought in a consultant played by Kate McKinnon to school him on how to behave, and Biden immediately started nuzzling her head and rubbing her arms. “Yeah, so this is exactly the kind of thing I’m here to prevent.”
“Wait, I think nose to nose is going to be OK,” Biden replied. “Because look, I did the 23andme thing, like Lizzie, what’s her name, Warren, right? It turns out that I’m 1-percent Eskimo, so I’m allowed to do the kissing.” When she told him he shouldn’t be hugging or kissing any women he meets, he protested. “That’s a human connection. That’s my whole thing,” he said. “That’s like telling Mario Batali to take his Crocs off.”
Later, they presented some female voters so Biden could practice and when he was told one was looking for someone who could beat Donald Trump, he asked, “You mean the guy who actually bragged about assault on tape?”
“Yes, but unlike his voters, your voters actually care,” his staffer replied.
Ultimately, Biden admitted he didn’t really learn anything from the experience. “But the important thing, I think, is that I’m listening, I hear you, I feel you,” Biden said. “So let’s hug it out, America, what do you say? Biden and some woman in 2020, right? We can do this!” READ THIS LIST"
The Secret Service Agent Who Jailed the KKK and Paved the Way to Guantanamo,www.thedailybeast.com,Lewis Beale,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-secret-service-agent-who-jailed-the-kkk-and-paved-the-way-to-guantanamo,"INNOVATOR The Secret Service Agent Who Jailed the KKK and Paved the Way to Guantanamo History has all but forgotten Hiram C. Whitley, who ran the Secret Service for U.S. Grant, but he infiltrated the Klan and inaugurated the nation’s first anti-terror efforts. 04.06.19 10:24 PM ET Amazon
On the night of September 2, 1871, several members of the Ku Klux Klan locked up Henry Lowther, a black farmer from Georgia whom they accused of plotting an armed uprising of black men and sleeping with white women. Two nights later, 180 Klansmen took Lowther from his cell, tied him up, and led him to a swamp, where they threatened to lynch or castrate him.
They chose the latter.
Atrocities like these were not uncommon in the South after the Civil War, which was why the United States Secret Service set up a clandestine unit to infiltrate and destroy the Klan. In Freedom’s Detective: The Secret Service, The Ku Klux Klan and the Man Who Masterminded America’s First War On Terror , author Charles Lane tells how Hiram C. Whitley , then head of the Secret Service, ran this anti-terrorist operation, and how some of his methodology continues to influence today’s war on groups like Isis and Al Qaeda.
“Whitley has been completely lost to history,” said Lane in an interview with The Daily Beast. “He does not get the credit he deserves for innovative tactics fighting this unprecedented evil in the country.”
Whitley was not the most obvious choice to run a program tasked with protecting the black citizens of the South and their white supporters. A former slave-catcher and ethically slippery businessman—Lane says in the book that “throughout his life, Hiram C. Whitley practiced situational honesty”—Whitley initially entered the spy business when he offered his services to the Union Army as a source of intelligence on rebel-held areas north of New Orleans.
After the war, and after a period of time living in Massachusetts, where he was accused of swindling an apothecary out of his shop and selling fake whiskey and diamonds (he somehow managed to avoid criminal liability in these cases), Whitley moved to D.C. looking for government work, and soon got a temporary appointment as a special agent for the Treasury Department. Two years later he was named head of the Secret Service, which had been established only four years earlier, and was primarily used to detect counterfeiting.
Around this time the Klan, which had been established in 1865 by Confederate veterans, began a terror campaign targeting blacks and their white sympathizers. Supported by President Ulysses S. Grant and his allies in Congress, Whitley realized that in order to fight the Klan he had to infiltrate it and convince its members to turn against each other. “He was great at creating covert operations, and he had a knack for deception, disguise, and creating plausible deniability,” Lane told the Beast.
Whitley did more than that—he created the conditions that eventually culminated in the prison at Guantanamo. He and his men arrested suspects and material witnesses, then sent some of them to Fort Pulaski , on the Georgia coast near Savannah, where they were to be interrogated. He then placed previously isolated prisoners in a cell together, listened in on their conversations, and told them that if they did not confess their guilt, they would never be free until they did. And if they did, he could guarantee them a new life under government protection, thus creating the first witness protection program.
“Whitley was way ahead of his time in believing if you’re fighting terrorists you have to get them to confess, and the best way to do that is to isolate them,” said Lane. “The instinct he had to understand basic human emotions is very impressive. He didn’t waste a lot of time on lofty concepts.”
In fact, Whitley was not averse to early forms of psychological torture. In the case of two black men who were reluctant prosecution witnesses, Whitley threatened to shoot one of them with a cannon, and the other man he forced into a “sweatbox” for more than 24 hours. As Whitley himself put it, “in localities where the masses are defective, where the local police are governed by the popular prejudice and where every stranger is looked upon with suspicion, all routine methods of detection become useless and must be superseded by entirely new and original modes of procedure.”
There is little doubt that Whitley’s “original modes of procedure” had their effect. By late 1871, Klan violence in Alabama and the Carolinas, the main areas of the Secret Service’s operations, had practically ceased, and thousands of Klansmen had been arrested and indicted.
But in 1872, an election year during which Grant needed Southern votes to secure his re-election, the president and his administration felt that Whitley’s crackdown was simply an emergency measure that had stopped the violence, and could be scaled back. Whitley vehemently disagreed. “Fort Pulaski definitely led to Guantanamo and the concept that you don’t necessarily have to follow the letter of the law when interrogating terrorists.”
After Grant was re-elected (and carried eight of 11 former Confederate states), “a major feature of Grant’s second term was ‘we forced these guys to back off, now we can approach them with amnesty and pardons,’” said Lane. “Whitley was one of the very few who never believed you would win these people over with concessions. Because he was tapped into his agent’s reports, he knew better than [Grant and his advisers] did what they were dealing with. He felt we have to smash these people, crush them.”
That never happened. Eventually, many Klansmen were pardoned or served their sentences and resumed their violence, as Whitley had predicted. But by this point, tainted irrevocably by a bungled 1874 safe cracking intended to smear a political opponent, Whitley had resigned as chief of the Secret Service. He eventually moved to Emporia, Kansas, where he became a successful hotel owner and died, a forgotten man, in 1919.
Whitley lived in a different time, and many of his methods would be anathema today. “All the stuff that involves gathering evidence without legal procedures would be impossible,” said Lane. “To the extent Whitley’s agents gathered any physical evidence without warrants, that would be thrown out, and the Miranda warning would influence things.”
But Fort Pulaski definitely led to Guantanamo and the concept that you don’t necessarily have to follow the letter of the law when interrogating terrorists (waterboarding, anyone?). Still, said Lane, “even if you’re against the Klan, you could have misgivings about using covert methods to destroy them. But you can’t have a serious national state without having this capability.”
And there’s this: “If you are faced with a terrorist threat,” added Lane, “whether domestic or foreign, you must have a clandestine ability to fight it, and it must be organized lawfully. And fighting the Klan was the first time the United States had to deal with that.” READ THIS LIST"

In February 1945 it was destroyed by the Allied air campaign. 04.06.19 10:22 PM ET The Yorck Project
Around 10:30 p.m. on the night of Feb. 13, 1945, air raid sirens began to blare. This was not unusual; the sirens went off most nights. But as a civilian town that had largely managed to escape involvement in war production activities, Dresden had previously been spared from Allied attacks and had instead become a haven for German refugees.
On this night, the sirens were followed not just by a deadly rain of bombs, but a blanket attack of explosives that produced a vicious inferno.
Over the two days of the attack, Dresden went up in flames consuming everything in its path including a still unknown number of civilian lives that some estimates put in the hundreds of thousands.
“The bombs had thrown people into the trees,” Matthias Griebel, who was 8 at the time of the bombing, told The New York Times in 1995. “The streets had broken up. The water mains had broken. The gas pipes were on fire. It was how you would imagine hell.”
While nothing could dispel the tragedy of the lives lost, there was one bright spot amid the destruction. Dresden was a cultural mecca known for its impressive art collection. By the end of WWII , most of the treasures from the city’s Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, or Old Masters Gallery, had been safely secured in the countryside.
Among the estimated 450 works of art that were lost or destroyed by the firebombings and attendant looting by the Red Army in the aftermath of the war’s end, there is one canvas lost that is widely considered the most important: Gustave Courbet’s “The Stonebreakers.”
It was a revolutionary work, one of the French Realist’s greatest paintings, and in February of 1945, it was destroyed by the Allied air campaign.
Ninety-five years before fire rained down on Dresden, Courbet debuted his new painting “The Stonebreakers” at the Paris Salon of 1850-51 and reportedly caused “a sensation.”
It was a massive painting—5.5 feet-by-8.5 feet—on a scale normally reserved for historically important landscapes or portraits. But Courbet used his sizable canvas to portray two shabby peasants engaged in backbreaking labor. It was shocking.
Courbet began catching the attention of the French art establishment only two years prior to this scandalous exhibition. The young painter grew up in the countryside of Ornans, a place he had a deep connection to and one he painted often.
While he was born into a prosperous, land-owning family, he embraced populist politics, fashioned himself as a bohemian figure in the counterculture of the day, and reveled in shocking the establishment. (When offered the Legion of Honor in 1870, he gave the French cultural authorities a vocal and very public middle finger.)
In January, 1848, he wrote to his family, “I am about to make it any time now, for I am surrounded by people who are very influential in the newspapers and the arts, and who are very excited about my painting. Indeed, we are about to form a new school, of which I will be the representative in the field of painting.”
Later that year, he did indeed begin to enjoy some acclaim, but it was two years after that when Courbet catapulted himself into the artistic conversation when he showed a trio of controversial paintings at the annual Paris Salon. These three works, one of which was “The Stonebreakers,” are credited with establishing a new school of art—Realism.
While most prominent artists of the day were focused on painting monumental historical works or grand portraits of the well-to-do, Courbet began to paint ordinary people based on real-life scenes depicted exactly as he saw them. “It is not often that one encounters so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting”
“The Stonebreakers” was based on two men, one young and one old, whom he discovered engaged in grueling work on the side of the road when he returned to Ornans for an eight-month visit in October 1948.
“It is not often that one encounters so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting,” he told his friends and art critics Francis Wey and Jules Champfleury.
He described the resulting painting as “composed of two very pitiable figures… One is an old man, an old machine grown stiff with service and age… The one behind him is a young man about fifteen years old, suffering from scurvy.”
The critics, for their part, were not quite as delighted with the novel subject. They tossed around such incendiary accusations as “Socialist” and “democratic.”
“What appears to have most disturbed conservative critics about Courbet's art, and what prompted these and other charges, was its ‘deliberate ugliness,’ which meant its embrace of both a popular (‘ugly’) content and a popular (working-class) Salon audience,” Stephen Eisenman wrote in Nineteenth Century Art .
These barbs were fine with Courbet, who embraced the role of revolutionary. As New York Times art critic Roberta Smith once described him , “Courbet the man was deeply out of sorts, independent, ambitious, wily, perennially dissatisfied with his lot, in addition to being, as he himself put it, ‘the most arrogant man in France.’” He also “[lived] by the phrase “épater le bourgeois,’ or ‘shock the bourgeoisie.’”
Only five years after Courbet riled up the Parisian art establishment, big changes were also happening on the far side of neighboring Germany. On September 25, 1855, the vaunted Old Masters Gallery in Dresden moved into a shiny custom-made museum space in the Zwinger Palace.
The Semper Gallery had been built by one of the top architects of the day—Gottfried Semper—specifically for the impressive art collection that the city’s rulers had assembled over two centuries. It was just one more step that artistic Dresden took in solidifying its turn-of-the-century reputation as the “Paris on the Elbe.”
In its new, impressive space, the Old Masters Gallery continued to grow in size and prestige and in the early 20th century, its fortunes collided with that of the now-deceased Courbet when it acquired the painter’s 1850 masterpiece by way of a gift from the estate of German businessman Max Heinrich Eduard Pröll-Heuer. “The two nameless French men immortalized in oils went up in flames along with so many lives and other historical and architectural treasures”
But “The Stonebreakers’” reign on the walls of the Semper Gallery was relatively short lived. When war broke out in 1939, the museum closed its doors and went to work securing the collection. Paintings and other precious artifacts were evacuated to the countryside where they were dispersed among castles and mine-shafts for safekeeping. Why “The Stonebreakers” was not among them is unknown, but Courbet’s masterpiece stayed in Dresden with a handful of other works.
When the Allies descended on Dresden that dark February night, “The Stonebreakers” was in the path of destruction. The two nameless French men immortalized in oils went up in flames along with so many lives and other historical and architectural treasures.
In the aftermath of the end of WWII, Dresden authorities began to pick up the pieces of all that had been lost. While much of the city was cleared for new construction, the decision was made to rebuild and preserve the buildings around the Zwinger Palace including the Semper Gallery.
The Soviet army absconded with much of the city’s art collection when they came across the treasures stored in the countryside after invading the eastern part of Germany. But in the mid-1950s, an agreement was brokered and most of the works were returned home to the Old Masters Gallery where they remain today.
But an irreplaceable loss remains where “The Stonebreakers” once hung.
“When I stop being controversial, I'll stop being important,” Courbet wrote in an 1852 letter home . He never did, as his surviving work testifies, nor will the events of February 1945 that destroyed one of the greatest among them. READ THIS LIST"

Trans people suffer violence and discrimination (recently most odiously exemplified by President Trump's planned ban on trans troops ). They also live rich, full lives. Photographer Soraya Zaman wanted to show the humanity and beauty of the transmasculine community; to show people as they are in their own skin.
Transmasculity does not necessarily mean that her subjects identify as trans men. Zaman explained, ""Because transgender is an umbrella term, it can be imprecise and does not always describe specific identities and experiences. Transmasculine is a general, broader term for individuals who were (AFAB) Assigned Female at Birth but identify closer to the masculine (or male) side of the gender spectrum.""
Zaman further explained, “The binary days and the antiquated stereotypes of what it means to be born a girl or boy, are finally coming undone. It is time we acknowledge the human race is more unique and special than these strict and simplistic ways of being which are not relevant to anyone.”
Zaman's work challenges the stereotypical ways in which society limits gender fluidity. Using social media as a tool to find her subjects, Zaman interviewed and photographed over 29 individuals ranging in age from 18-35. She traveled to 21 states to show the vast range in personal experiences within the transmasculine community.
Zaman compiled the portraits and detailed testimonies in a book, American Boys , which is now available for purchase.

‘Killing Eve’ Season 2 Is So F*cking Good,www.thedailybeast.com,kevin.fallon@thedailybeast.com (Kevin Fallon),04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/killing-eve-season-2-review-sandra-oh-and-jodie-comer-are-better-than-ever,"DOUBLE OH SEVEN ‘Killing Eve’ Season 2 Is So F*cking Good Few drama series are this confident and this good right out of the gate in their second seasons. Sophomore slump? Sandra Oh would never. 04.06.19 10:18 PM ET Nick Wall/BBCAmerica
In the nine months since Killing Eve last aired, there’s been a question stalking the series that’s been almost as anxiety-inducing as the chase in the drama itself: Do we really need a season two?
As the number of offerings catapult right up the #PeakTV summit and then up and over the edge, even the biggest fans of certain shows have started to question whether there’s really value in continuing past a first season of television that, as it presented itself in its original form, was practically perfect. Perfect is a strong word, but Killing Eve is a series that merits those .
Phoebe Waller-Bridge ’s BBC America crime series, in which Sandra Oh plays an assassin-obsessed MI6 agent and Jodie Comer the psychopath killer who catches her eye, was unlike anything we had ever seen.
It was a thriller as intense, twisty, and exhilarating as they come, but injected with a style, whimsy, and decidedly feminine deviousness that made each scene its own surprise. What tone would it be? Which shade of Comer’s Villanelle were we going to get? And, the most exciting question, who is chasing whom?

It’s rare for something to feel that special given the imposing mountain of shows there are out there, so it’s understandable to want to milk something that unique for all it’s worth. But there’s also the instinct that maybe we should let nice things be.
This isn’t the first time TV fans have struggled with this existential question. And it’s worth noting that nearly all recent examples have featured women front and center in new takes on genres that used to be dismissed because of their presumed feminine audience. For some, the decision to continue has worked. ( The Handmaid’s Tale , for example.) For others, it very much did not. ( UnREAL .) The jury’s still out on Big Little Lies , and we’re still waiting to hear if they’ll pull the trigger on more Sharp Objects .
But for now, at least, we have the new Killing Eve . And the new Killing Eve is good.
Everything that worked so well in season one is back in essentially the same form, and it’s working again. If that sounds like the show might be retreading the same quirks and feel a bit repetitive, well, that’s true. But it’s such a blast, and so meticulously, weirdly crafted, that you frankly don’t care.
Things pick up, wisely, 30 seconds after we last left.
Eve and Villanelle’s bizarre attraction to each other unexpectedly combusts when they finally spend time together in Villanelle’s apartment. Eve stabs her. Villanelle shoots at Eve. While Eve cowers in the kitchen, Villanelle runs away.
Restarting the action immediately after the events of the finale is a clever way to maintain the first season’s most refreshing creative rule. Killing Eve never bothered with the exhausting exposition that pads and drags most American crime dramas, ensuring the brisk thrill ride blasts off from the first moments. In season two, there’s no need for ham-fisted explanations for why these two are back on each other’s trails again. It’s only been 30 seconds. They never left.
Eve finds her way back to London and basically returns to her previous role of obsessing over Villanelle’s whereabouts, spending all hours of the night Googling for news of where she might have gone. No one could have predicted how appealing a Sandra Oh version of James Bond would be. Double Oh Seven?
It’s Villanelle whose narrative is upended. She’s used to be the being the one who preys. Now she’s injured and on the lam, a fish-out-of-water scenario in which it’s a riot to see her try to keep her bearings—though you suspect, with this cold-blooded killer, she’s always in more control than she lets on. “‘Killing Eve’ never bothered with the exhausting exposition that pads and drags most American crime dramas, ensuring the brisk thrill ride blasts off from the first moments.”
She ends up sharing a hospital room with a teen boy named Gabriel, and she seems to let her guard down, exhibiting some compassion and empathy. You let your guard down, too, which is a mistake.
You spend these scenes—and so many more across the two episodes we were given to review—wondering how human she is. And when it’s made clear again that she isn’t, it’s still jarring every time. The extent to which she, through Comer’s performance, manages to replicate human emotion, though, is spell-binding. It’s what lends the series its menace.
The wicked humor is back. The macabre peculiarities are back. The riveting obsession between these two characters is back again, too.
“Women don’t stab,” Gabriel tells Villanelle when she tells him what Eve did to her. “I know. It surprised me, too. She did it to let me know how much she cared about me,” she says back.
Obsession takes on a different context when it’s women who have the preoccupation, and Killing Eve plays with those suppositions with such canny wit and perverse awareness. The show has the effect of at once mocking the audience for those coded suppositions while engaging in the slickest, smartest spy drama of the modern TV era.
In a show of confidence for season two and its potential to hold on to the all the attention and accolades the first season earned, Killing Eve will be broadcast on both BBC America and AMC this year. The latter, of course, is the network of Mad Men , Breaking Bad , Better Call Saul , and The Walking Dead .
The promotion is business-related—no modern cable series saw its ratings climb the way that Killing Eve ’s did last year—but it’s also symbolic, signaling the show as the next in that crop of elite offerings. It would be the only female-fronted series in the mix, which certainly means something. And it’s about time, too.

What Does Queen Think About Brexit?

It’s Trashing the New Britain She Loves. In the month of Meghan’s baby, everything that the new young royals represent and that the Queen has embraced is being sacrificed to a lunatic idea of the great island race. 04.06.19 10:16 PM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photos Getty
LONDON—The performance of the British Parliament in the Brexit crisis has become so imbecilic that some people are desperately hoping that the Queen might intervene.
Not a chance. The last time a monarch stopped a piece of legislation was in 1707 when Queen Anne struck down an act that would have given Scotland its own militia. As fans of the movie The Favourite will know, Queen Anne could be a handful.
Queen Elizabeth is no Queen Anne and she has spent a lifetime avoiding offering any hint of her political views with consummate skill. During that time the British Empire was dismantled and, along with it went the pretense of any longer being a world power.
All this she seemed to accept as the natural forces of history at work. Her monarchy might easily have gone the way of other European royal houses, either by being reduced to using their titles as grifters among high society or becoming bicycle-riding social democrats.
But the Windsors hung on, politically neutered but tolerated as part of the national scenery in which palaces and castles were still expected to be inhabited.
The Queen had bad moments when it seemed she had lost touch with the mood of her people. The worst example was her tardiness in realizing and acknowledging the depth of public grief over the death of Princess Diana.
But in the last decades of her reign–the longest ever of a British monarch– Elizabeth has not only appeared to embrace the new spirit of her people but to enjoy it in a way that suggests that she must really loathe Brexit and its self-destructive xenophobia.
The evidence for this is in one event that cannot now be overlooked: the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
As with many other Olympics this one might have brought another over-reaching exercise in national propaganda.
But instead of a humorless rear-gazing pageant of lost glories we got a howlingly bonkers street party masterminded by the movie director Danny Boyle that left the rest of the world thinking what a fun country we had become.
There was no menace to others in the script. No sense that festering somewhere offstage in the shires beyond London’s vivid entrepot was a nasty insurgency of aggrieved nativists waiting for the right moment to strike.
Boyle’s script was a masterful balance of messages: secure enough to be self-mocking; shrewd enough to parade world famous cultural icons like Harry Potter, James Bond and David Beckham; nutty enough to be a mix of rock opera and a history of the industrial revolution; clever enough to include the inevitable patriotic trope involving Churchill as a suddenly animate statue; and political enough to make a pointed tableau supporting the National Health Service and universal free health care when the Tories were trying to roll it back. (Boyle faced down a Tory effort to cut it from the program.) “The monarch was at one with a message about her country as a youthful, liberally progressive multi-racial society no longer bound by the old jingoism of what was once aggressively asserted as a distinct ‘island race.’”
And the Queen topped it all by participating in a stunt in which all her assumed dignity, remoteness and solemnity were thrown to the winds.
Boyle directed a sequence in which a taxi draws up at Buckingham Palace and deposits someone so famous that schoolchildren on a tour of the palace impudently break away from the guide to gawk at him—Daniel Craig, a.k.a. James Bond.
At this point it is necessary to caution that any nation that builds a reputation for superlative national intelligence on the record of a misogynistic sociopath like Bond is delusional but no matter: The whole world enjoys the joke, hopefully.
Bond is shown into the Queen’s presence and—a move that apparently the Queen herself suggested—she at first ignores him, finally turning from writing notes at her desk, and utters the magic name, “Mr. Bond.”
What followed was, literally, breathtaking: the Queen follows Bond to a waiting chopper, they zoom low over a series of landmarks and arrive over the Olympic Stadium as the opening ceremony begins, caught in searchlights. Bond and the Queen (daring body doubles) parachute into the arena and then, cutting to the actual event, the Queen makes her entrance to officially declare the games open.
For the massive global television audience watching it was a stunning coup de théâtre . And it was a clear hint of the message to follow. The monarch was at one with a message about her country as a youthful, liberally progressive multi-racial society no longer bound by the old jingoism of what was once aggressively asserted as a distinct “island race.”
And it is that Queen and that message that has been made to look defeated by the Brexit rabble. Why wouldn’t Her Majesty be really pissed?
At this very moment the Queen is about to become the great-grandmother of a child born to a mixed-race divorcee and a grandson whom she has embraced with unstinted enthusiasm.
Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were married in St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle in a ceremony that rang with the spirit of a rainbow coalition—a gospel choir from Chicago rocking the place with “Stand by Me,” Meghan and Harry’s generation sitting in the pews alongside doddery old dukes and Oprah! A television audience of 1.9 billion!
And yet beneath the consecration of such enlightened and modern family values there lurked a paradox. This was Windsor Castle and the chapel was hung with heraldic banners noting the many honors bestowed on those who went forth to conquer the world as white Christian crusaders from the island race.
So the royal pageant could be seen in two starkly different and subjective ways in which each response ignored the other. Through one set of eyes the monarchy was passing from one generation to another with the Queen assenting happily to the ecumenical new Windsors. Through another set of equally fervent eyes this was Britannia in Excelsis, the thundering medieval setting overcoming a charade of change and summoning all the atavistic emotions of Brexit.
Like the rest of the country this leaves the Queen dangerously poised between relevance and irrelevance.
Should Brexit prevail the new young royals could find themselves imprisoned for life as the indentured cast of the world’s most loved soap opera. Will and Kate, Harry and Meghan and their children will be one of the few surefire sources of revenue for a beleaguered island economy as they attract waves of tourists.
In dramatic terms this has all the glamor and tensions of the Netflix blockbuster The Crown . The Queen finally succeeded by the petulant and broody Charles in thrall to his matriarchal ex-paramour, now an overweening duchess; questions about whether the institution can survive until King Will ascends; endless tabloid fictions about family feuds while as this narrative constantly reinvents itself Scotland declares independence and rejoins the European Union, Northern Ireland is absorbed into a united Ireland that, helped by the largesse of E.U. funding, becomes the economic miracle of Europe.
Alas poor England, left as the exhausted rump of the kingdom , now no more than a giant theme park composed of tourist sites drawing on a combination of The Crown and Downton Abbey , with some of the royal castles sold off to become part of the enduring Harry Potter franchise.
The Queen must by now surely realize along with millions of her subjects that Brexit is not a natural force of history at work. It is a rejection of the future and a rush backward to isolation and impotence. As such it must be intolerable to the woman who has learned from her own history that fall need not necessarily follow decline. READ THIS LIST"
The Stonewall Riots Weren’t New York City’s Only Queer Uprising,www.thedailybeast.com,Hugh Ryan,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/stonewall-wasnt-new-york-citys-only-queer-uprising-remembering-the-haven-riot,"The Stonewall Riots Weren’t New York City’s Only Queer Uprising Photofusion/Shutterstock The Stonewall Riots were not in isolation. As their 50th anniversary approaches, we should remember New York City's other cops vs. queers clashes of the era, like the Haven riot. Hugh Ryan 04.06.19 10:13 PM ET
O n a hot summer night nearly 50 years ago, a gang of New York City police decided to make an example of a gay club in Greenwich Village. An election was approaching, and the police had been cracking down on queer people all around the city in the lead-up to it.
After hauling the patrons out into the street, the police trashed the bar. According to a report in Gay Flames (“A Bulletin of the Homofire Movement”), they destroyed “7 telephones, two 15-foot bars, a dozen couches, electric consoles, wiring, strobe lights, speakers and amplifiers… [and] about 3,000 smashed phonograph records”—a total of some $20,000 in damages.
This was fairly routine— cops have been busting bars that serve queer men in New York City since at least the early 1900s —but that night, something was different.
The patrons fought back, and soon, people all over the Village joined in. Clashes went on for hours (some say days), and before the evening was over, a jewelry shop and a record store had been smashed and looted, two cars had been overturned, a score of public trash cans were set on fire, multiple people were clubbed by the cops, and at least 10 were arrested.
No, I’m not talking about what happened at the Stonewall Inn that infamous day in June, 1969. This was a 1970 raid on The Haven, an alcohol-free gay after-hours club located at 1 Sheridan Square. Although the Stonewall Riot is often thought of as a singular event, unlike anything else in queer American history , it was but the first of a series of clashes between cops and queers in the late 1960s and early 1970s—at least, the first in New York.
In San Francisco, the police had experienced similar queer resistance when they tried to hassle trans women hanging out at the Compton Cafeteria in 1966 , sparking nights of queer resistance.
Since the end of World War II, police harassment of the queer community in America had been steadily escalating, and as American politics turned radical in the late 1960s, the queer community began to resist in more visible, vocal, and confrontational ways.
This was a period of incredible militancy and direct action by marginalized communities around the country, including queer people, black power activists, women’s liberationists, and others.
In Los Angeles in 1959, LGBT customers fought back against police harassment at a popular branch of Cooper Do-Nuts. In 1961, a group of homophobic servicemen decided to—foolishly— target the patrons of the Black Nite bar in Milwaukee, who fought back. In 1967, there were demonstrations after a violent police raid of the LGBT Black Cat Tavern in Silver Lake, Los Angeles.
Looking at other anti-police queer-led protests shows us that Stonewall was not a unique historical outlier, but the inevitable product of the clash between post-World-War-II homo/transphobia, and the growing strength of the newly empowered queer community.
While direct actions like Stonewall obviously helped change the course of queer life in America , they did so in conjunction with other, more conciliatory forms of queer resistance.
In 1965, activists from the Mattachine Society opposed the New York State Liquor Authority’s policy of shuttering any bar that served out homosexuals; shortly thereafter, the New York State Commission on Human Rights would publicly agree with their stance, cutting the legal legs out from under the police who raided queer establishments.
By 1967, gay activists had convinced Mayor John Lindsay to also oppose the routine police entrapment of queer men in New York City. The erosion of these institutional homophobic policies set the stage for the expansion of out queer community in the mid-1970s, but it took the masses of queer people fighting back in the streets to give real teeth to this decriminalization of homosexual life.
Between 1969 and 1972, Greenwich Village was rocked by a series of queer counter rebellions, protest marches, and building take-overs—many of them inspired by, on behalf of, or in conjunction with, other marginalized communities.
By looking what happened at The Haven in August of 1970 it’s possible to see just how much these various liberation movements overlapped and influenced one another.
According to Steven Dansky’s collected oral history Hot August Night/1970 , before the police ever arrived at the club that evening, queer people and feminists of all kinds had already gathered in Times Square, to participate in a rally against police violence.
Planning for the action began when two Latinx attendees came to a Gay Liberation Front (GLF) meeting in July to let the largely white, downtown crowd know about the escalating violence against queer and gender non-conforming people in Times Square (primarily, but not exclusively, people of color).
A whole host of organizations would participate in the rally itself, including GLF, the Gay Activists Alliance, the 'Radicalesbians,' and a coalition of women’s liberation groups.
From the beginning, the marchers were prepared for police harassment; along with chants of “gay, gay power to the gay, gay people,” they called out “male chauvinists you better start shakin’—today’s pig is tomorrow’s bacon,” according to an article written by participant Martha Shelley .
After marching around Times Square several times, the protesters spontaneously decided to march down to Christopher Street—“the symbolic birthplace of our movement,” as Kenneth Pitchford described it in an article he later wrote for Double F , “a magazine of Effeminism.” “ If we thought our rage had peaked before, now we felt something new; the hard tightening of something final in our guts ”
Along the way, the marchers were attacked by straight onlookers, who threw bottles and trash from the safety of apartments high above their heads. Not only did the police fail to intervene, according to Shelley, they also refused to bring two wounded marchers to the hospital, leaving community members to bring them by taxi instead.
Thus, the crowd was already on edge by the time they crossed 14th Street; as Pitchford recalled, “If we thought our rage had peaked before, now we felt something new; the hard tightening of something final in our guts.”
When they reached the Women’s House of Detention—the 11-story women’s prison that was once located at the intersection of 6th and Greenwich Aves— they found themselves joined by a large number of “street people,” in Pitchford’s words.
The area around the House of Detention had a reputation as a meeting point for the families and friends of those on the inside (particularly queer women), dating back at least to the 1930s.
Jay Toole , a community organizer who was imprisoned at the House of D multiple times over the course of the 1960s, remembered the prison was occasionally referred to as “the playground” by butches. The corner of 8th Street and 6th Avenue, Toole told me, was “where we met our girls” as they went to or left the House of D.
Most likely, these were the “street people” that joined the protest outside the prison that night. Estimates put the size of the crowd at anywhere from 250 to 2,000 people.
Joan Nestle, the founder of the Lesbian Herstory Archives , called the House of Detention “a warning, a beacon, a reminder and a moment of community,” which was omnipresent in lesbian life in the 1960s.
In the immediate aftermath of the Stonewall Riots, the newly formed Gay Liberation Front helped organize a week of 24/7 protests outside the prison. In March of 1970, a number of women’s liberation groups engaged in a tense, and at times violent, standoff with police outside the prison gates (and later that same night, the police, led by the same officer in charge during the Stonewall raid, attacked The Snake Pit , a gay bar in the Village, perhaps in retribution).
However, according to Stonewall veteran Jim Fouratt, most of the official protests directed at the House of D, even by LGBTQ groups, were over the illegal arrest and detainment of Black Panther Party leaders.
Joan Bird had just been released from the prison a month before The Haven riot, in July of 1970, and Angela Davis would be held there for months starting that October (although Davis wouldn’t publicly come out as a lesbian until the late 1990s, in her autobiographyshe described homosexuality as “one of the centers around which life in the House of Detention revolved.”)
This relationship of support was not one way. Just a few months before The Haven raid, the Black Panther Party’s Minister of Defense, Huey P. Newton, had issued a statement calling for the Panthers to “try to form a working coalition with the Gay Liberation and Women's Liberation Groups” (most likely influenced by his friendship with civil rights and gay power activist Kiyoshi Kuromiya ).
The BPP had obvious, long-standing, and well-discussed issues with homophobia and misogyny (as did pretty much the entirety of the Left, and the country, at the time), but the positive relationships between 1970s liberationists rarely get the same amount of attention.
The Women’s House of Detention in Greenwich Village was one of the sites where the concerns of nearly every liberation movement—black, Latino, feminist, anti-racist, queer, Third World, Marxist, etc.—connected.
After protesting the prison, the march began to disperse – at which point, activists heard about what was happening at The Haven. Many believed the cops knew that most queer activists would be at the rally in Times Square that night, and had raided The Haven assuming there would be little opposition.
But the cops were wrong.
As Martha Shelley wrote, “Masses of people, marchers and cruisers, crowded up in front of the Haven. A sister whispered to me, ‘There’s going to be trouble.’ Sure enough, the cops started swinging their nightsticks, and people began to run… Word came from behind us that the Women in the House of Detention had begun to riot and burn their mattresses. We took the crowd back to the House of D. Sure enough, flaming objects were descending from the windows.”
(While she wasn’t there the night of The Haven raid, Angela Davis described the experience of being on the inside during a similar protest in her autobiography. Women throughout the building chanted along with the protesters and refused to return to their cells. After 48 hours, the guards beat one imprisoned woman so loudly the rest could hear, and threw her in solitary confinement, to get the rest to behave.)
As the women in the House of D began rioting, the night descended into a pitched street battle. According to Pitchford,
The well-organized police violence began. First massing, then moving out on the double, clubbing in all directions, seizing prey at random, dragging people away. One of our badly beaten street-fighters, a young black brother was carried off unconscious. People knelt down and daubed their hands with his blood and streaked it over their faces like war paint… six cops with clubs surrounded a captive faggot (a white brother, this time) in front of a store window grating and slammed him against it again and again, his head battered, his groin prodded with clubs. His screams pulled us toward him – until a heavy line of club-swinging police reinforcements drove us back…
They said afterward that two cars had been overturned, seven cops hurt (one supposedly knifed, according to the Daily News), 18 of our people arrested, and (hopefully) Inspector Michael Lonergan of the Third Division kneed in the groin… Lesbians and faggots found a new pride and anger in themselves, and stepped out from behind all sorts of brain-damaging euphemisms and began to learn how to fight the vicious genocidal system that oppresses us as much as any other un-Amerikan people in the world.
By dawn, it seemed the protests had subsided, although a few people remember isolated incidents between queer people and cops over the next two days. The weekend papers were filled with accounts of the gay violence in Greenwich Village—as well as stories of three police raids on Black Panther Party offices in Philadelphia, which ended in gun fights, clouds of tear gas, fifteen arrests, and three wounded officers. “ Had Stonewall not occurred, we would have immortalized a different moment of queer resistance ”
Unlike Stonewall, however, The Haven raid and the House of Detention protest were quickly forgotten. A general amnesia about queer militancy—and the connections between various liberation and power movements—set in quickly.
Stonewall would be more likely to be referenced in connection with the death of Judy Garland than in connection with the other uprisings that took place in the early 1970s.
Stonewall obviously inspired much of the courageous activism that came afterwards—including that on the night of The Haven raid—but almost certainly, had Stonewall not occurred, we would have immortalized a different moment of queer resistance.
As we take this time to immortalize Stonewall, we should also remember Mattachine and 'Radicalesbians'; The Black Panther Party and the Women’s House of Detention; The Haven Raid, The Snake Pit Raid, and every other forgotten (or not-yet-remembered) moment of queer resistance."
Four of the Greatest Lost Cities Remain Unfound. Where Could They Be?,www.thedailybeast.com,Candida Moss,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/el-dorado-to-baiae-four-of-the-greatest-lost-cities-remain-unfound-where-could-they-be,"GET ON IT Four of the Greatest Lost Cities Remain Unfound. Where Could They Be? Discovering a ruined ancient city does rather seem like the archaeological equivalent of winning an Olympic gold. 04.06.19 10:11 PM ET John Elk III / Alamy
After 14 years of digging, archaeologists excavating in the Holy Land announced that they have found the biblical city of Ai, a Caananite stronghold that was captured by the Israelites (according to the book of Judges). It’s not the only recently discovered city of cultural significance: only two years ago Douglas Preston published a book documenting his team’s discovery of the so-called Lost City of the Monkey God in the Honduran jungle. News like this makes you wonder what other important lost cities are out there to be discovered.
1. El Dorado
In the early 16th century, German conquistadors Nikolaus Federmann and Georg von Speyer set off in search of El Dorado, a mythical golden city, in Venezuela. They didn’t find it, and instead became the first of many 16th century European treasure hunters who hoped and failed to locate the famed valley of gold. In pursuit of gold (and cinnamon), one of these, Francisco de Orellana, “discovered” the Amazon river (which they named after a group of female warriors who attacked their group along the way). The efforts of predominantly Spanish conquistadors to discover (and pillage) the city of gold were related to colonialist exploitation of the region in general and particularly their observation of the use of gold in pre-Colombian religious rituals and ceremonies. The Musica people used to adorn new kings with gold before depositing a trove of golden objects in the middle of a lake as part of religious ceremonies. The discovery of a cache of gold at Lake Guatavita in 1545 only added fuel to the rumors that more was out there to be found. When Alexander von Humboldt visited the area in 1801 he estimated that as much as $300 million worth of gold was there. El Dorado, on the other hand, appears to be a mythical outgrowth of religious rituals.
Archaeologist Dr. Larry Coben, the executive director of the Sustainable Preservation Initiative and a seasoned excavator of Incan sites, told The Daily Beast that he would love to take an academically responsible approach to finding the lost cities. Just like his predecessors, Coben would be in the Amazonian jungle conducting exploratory work (in a less sensationalist and more scientific way); unlike them, Coben doesn’t expect to find any gold. “I doubt they are ‘cities of gold,’” he told me, but the mythology is likely to be based on real cities, the discovery of which could yield important information about the sites. “The extraordinary ability of ancient cultures to bring complex urbanity to difficult and not obvious places speaks volumes about their development, technological competence, and social and economic structures.” Unearthing them would help flesh out our understanding of the pre-Colombian world. Those who really want to see the remnants of the “cities of gold” should go to the Museo del Oro in Bogota, which houses the largest collection of gold artifacts in the world.
2. Dilmun
Dilmun was an ancient Semitic speaking city in the Persian Gulf that was first mentioned in the 3rd millennium B.C. It came to the attention of Assyriologists and explorers in the 19th century, when cuneiform texts were recovered and translated. The most famous of these was the Epic of Gilgamesh, which includes the ancient Mesopotamian flood story that likely inspired the biblical story. Dr. Alexis Boutin, associate professor of anthropology at Sonoma State University, told me that these texts describe Dilmun “as a place with paradise-like qualities, especially noted for its sweet (i.e., fresh) waters.” Because of this, “some people even thought it may have been the location of the original Garden of Eden.” What we do know from the extant Mesopotamian texts is that Dilmun was a major trading partner with Mesopotamia, in particular Meluhha (the Indus civilization) and Magan (Oman). For a while, though, scholars weren’t even sure that this potential Garden of Eden was a civilization at all. Boutin told me that because of the thousands of burial mounds carpeting Bahrain, some 19th century scholars thought that it had served as a necropolis for ancient Mesopotamians. “This theory, however, was later disproven by excavations that revealed that Bronze Age urban and commercial centers on Bahrain were an important part of the Dilmun polity.”
The physical location of Dilmun, however, was disputed for many decades, although it always assumed to be somewhere in the vicinity of the Arabian Gulf. Dr. Boutin told me that “based on archaeological work done in the 1940s and 1950s by folks including Peter Cornwall, Geoffrey Bibby, and P.V. Glob (and since carried on by archaeologists primarily from Denmark, France, and Bahrain), the location of Dilmun is now known to have been centered on Bahrain, although it seems to have extended to parts of Kuwait, eastern Saudi Arabia, and Qatar as well.” As for its mythical garden and sweet-smelling waters, those have yet to be discovered.
3. Baiae
Everyone needs a place to let off steam; for the emperors and wealthy playboys of the ancient world, the city of Baiae, located on the northern edge of the Bay of Naples in Italy, served this purpose from the first century B.C. through the fifth century A.D. Unfortunately for us, and thanks to its location in a volatile volcanic area, at least half of the ancient city was submerged by the eighth century A.D. It’s not so much, archaeologist Dr. Kristina Killgrove told me, that we don’t know where it is, we just can’t get to it. She told me that this hidden trove of “villas of the ancient rich and famous” was attractive to early 19th century poets like Keats and Shelley, who talk about the lost wonders of Baiae. Presumably these included important and gorgeous ancient artwork like wall frescoes, artifacts, and sculptures.
Some excavation in the area has been done and modern tourists can also visit the underwater archaeological park . Killgrove said that hopefully more excavation in this area at in the future could “help us learn more about how emperors and other important Romans worked and played.”
4. The Lost City of Kalahari
In 1885 Guillermo Farini (a pseudonym of William Leonard Hunt), a former entertainer at Coney Island in New York, crossed a section of the Kalahari that had previously been unexplored by Westerners. Naturally, Farini was actually looking for diamonds. In the book he published upon his return, Farini claimed that he had come across the ruins of building, a remnant of an unknown civilization. In his book (and, I kid you not, in somewhat patronizing poetry) he described “A half-buried ruin - a huge wreck of stones/ On a lone and desolate spot;/ A temple - or a tomb for human bones/ Left by men to decay and rot. Rude sculptured blocks/ from the red sand project,/ And shapeless uncouth stones appear,/ Some great man's ashes designed to protect,/ Buried many a thousand year.” His claims were supported by photographs and sketches taken and made by his son during the trip. The legend of the lost city of Kalahari had its origin in local legends in which construction on the city was abandoned because the region was inhospitable. Farini’s “discovery” spawned a South African legend. Others claimed that they too had seen the tell-tale signs of civilization. People compared the discovery to the archaeological discoveries at Great Zimbabwe , a ruined city that flourished from the 11th to the 15th centuries in the southeastern hills of Zimbabwe.
In the early 20th century no fewer than 25 expeditions were undertaken to find the site. F. R. Paver and Dr. W. M. Borcherds used World War II-era reconnaissance aircraft to scour the region, but with no success. In the 1960s Professor A. J. Clement attempted to retrace Farini’s steps. He discovered a set of monumental rocks that seemed suggestive of man-made walls, but they were actually a 180 million-year-old geological feature. Geologists who saw the photographs made by Clement’s team suggested that the rocks were made of dolerite, a kind of igneous rock that, as it erodes, can produce the appearance of regular blocks. Clement concluded that Farini had discovered a natural rock formation and mistaken it for a ruined city. He wrote, “Like all legends, that of the Lost City will be a long time a-dying, and doubtless there will still be some who are disinclined to let the matter rest in spite of all the contrary evidence. And possibly this is just as well, for there is something rather sad about the destruction of a legend.”
Most recently, in 2016, a Travel Channel-sponsored expedition to the region hosted by Josh Gates discovered some artificially constructed walls and artwork in the area that may match Farini’s description. Has Kalahari’s Lost City been discovered and does it exist? The jury is still out.
Discovering a ruined ancient city does rather seem like the archaeological equivalent of winning an Olympic gold, but those who have ambitions of rediscovering fallen civilizations should get their vaccinations and protective charms in order. The fate that awaits those who rediscover lost parts of the ancient world is usually an unhappy one.
Howard Carter and his team were struck down by the Mummy’s Curse after opening the tomb of Tutankhamun: first Lord Canarvon died of an infected mosquito bite; several others were blinded and killed; the house of Sir Bruce Ingram (an early visitor to the tomb) burned down. And Douglas Preston and his group acquired a flesh-eating bacteria after their trip to the Honduras. Opening the gates to the past comes with some considerable health risks. READ THIS LIST"

Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News Sunday morning that the House Democrats will “never” see President Trump’s tax returns , setting the White House stance on an issue that has roiled Washington over the past week.
Pushing back in what could be a losing battle, Mulvaney added, “Nor should they. That’s an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns. They knew that he didn’t and they elected him anyway.”
Last week, House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, a Democrat, wrote a letter to IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig and demanded the agency deliver six years wroth of the president’s personal and business returns.
Neal gave the IRS a deadline of April 10, citing a federal tax quote that states the Treasury has an obligation to turn over the records upon such a request.
The president maintains that he cannot deliver the tax returns because of an ongoing audit. “We’re under audit, despite what people said, and we’re working that out,” Trump told reporters last week. “I’m always under audit, it seems. But I’ve been under audit for many years because the numbers are big, and I guess when you have a name, you’re audited.”
Mulvaney said that Democrats “know they're not going to get the tax returns.”
“They just want attention on the issue because they don’t want to talk to us about policy,” he said.
“They know one of the fundamental principles of the IRS is to protect the confidentiality of you and me and everybody else who files taxes,” Mulvaney added. “They know that. They know the terms under law by which the IRS can give them the documents, but ‘political hit job’ is not one of those reasons.”
Democratic Representative Dan Kildee, who is on the committee seeking Trump’s returns, told ABC News that the president and his lawyers are wrong about the law.
“This is a legitimate authority that the Congress has,” Kildee said. “This president, by the way, is the least transparent president that we’ve had in half a century.”
Kildee said that the president would not have the final word on whether his tax returns are released. “It is not up to President Trump, it is not up to some lawyer that President Trump hires, to determine whether his tax returns can be sought,” Kildee said. “This is not an autocracy. The president does not get to decide for himself and for Congress what a legitimate subject of inquiry might be.”"

American Tourist Kimberly Sue Endicott and Tour Guide Jean Paul Mirenge Reportedly Found Alive in Uganda,www.thedailybeast.com,Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau) Victoria.Albert@thedailybeast.com (Victoria Albert),04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/american-tourist-kimberly-sue-endicott-and-tour-guide-jean-paul-mirenge-reported-found-in-uganda,"04.07.19 1:11 PM ET ISAAC KASAMANI/Getty
Kimberly Sue Endicott, the American tourist from Costa Mesa, California, who was kidnapped along with her tour guide on a safari in Uganda were rescued alive, according to local authorities.
“She has been located and rescued unharmed,” Uganda military spokesman Brigadier Richard Karemire told Reuters . Police said on Twitter that the Endicott and her Congolese tour guide “are in good health” and “in the safe hands” of security officials.
Citing a spokesperson for Wild Frontiers Uganda and authorities, ABC News reported that Endicott and her Congolese tour guide were returned to a lodge at Queen Elizabeth National Park. Uganda’s police force said the pair was “rescued” but did not provide specifics. The kidnappers have reportedly escaped .
Endicott, who reportedly owns a small skin-care shop and is in her mid-50’s, has been missing since Tuesday when four kidnappers stopped the safari group at gunpoint in Queen Elizabeth National Park. Endicott reportedly has a daughter and a granddaughter.
Her 48-year-old driver, Jean-Paul Mirgene Remezo, was also taken in the kidnapping. Two elderly tourists with the group were left in the safari jeep.
Local police say the kidnappers used Endicott’s mobile phone to demand a $500,000 ransom. Cops believe the motive behind the kidnapping was financial, mainly because the men quickly made their demand for the money using Endicott’s cellphone.
The kidnappers have reportedly been trying to negotiate her release. It was not clear if any money was exchanged and, if so, how much.
Kidnappings of this nature are rare in Uganda, Reuters reports. The most recent high-profile kidnapping occurred in 1999, when eight tourists and four guides were killed in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, just south of Queen Elizabeth National Park. READ THIS LIST"

This ‘Oklahoma!’ on Broadway Is Dark and Different—Brilliantly So,www.thedailybeast.com,tim.teeman@thedailybeast.com (Tim Teeman),04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/oklahoma-on-broadway-is-dark-and-differentbrilliantly-so,"ALL CHANGE This ‘Oklahoma!’ on Broadway Is Dark and Different—Brilliantly So The excellent Bard Summerscape ‘Oklahoma!’ that opens Sunday on Broadway has the music you may remember, but its story of justice, revenge, and isolation is far from traditional. 04.07.19 8:59 PM ET Little Fang Photo
When the lights go out during Bard Summerscape’s astonishing production of Oklahoma! , which opens Sunday night on Broadway (Circle in the Square, to Sept. 1) , your body tenses.
This first blackout happens during the first confrontation between Curly McLain (Damon Daunno) and Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), and soon the Circle in the Square is thrumming with Curly’s menacing whisper, encouraging a frightening, lonely, and unstable Jud to end his own life.
The men’s words to each other are said straight into microphones and come to our unnerved ears as shafts of light slowly re-illuminate the space around us. We see Jud’s terrified, terrifying face fill the wall, as filmed by camera.
That darkness is not just confined to one scene but is spiritually draped over Daniel Fish’s daring, brilliant, utterly absorbing re-interpretation of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s 1943 musical play ; a first in itself. Next would come Carousel (1945), South Pacific (1949), and The King and I (1951). Like modern productions of those musical plays, this version of Oklahoma! interrogates themes of gender, desire, crime, and punishment.
It does this seriously and with fun, and with an overall smart snappiness in its tone and characters. Forget your traditional idea of Oklahoma! either from school productions or the 1955 movie, starring Gordon MacRae, Shirley Jones, and Rod Steiger. Fish’s characters don’t just smile and sing, and slap their knees, as they josh and chatter around Laurey’s farm house and the Skidmore ranch in turn of the 20th century Oklahoma .
They look inquiring, pained, split about what and who they want in their futures. The production—which I saw and loved when it was first mounted in New York City at St. Ann’s Warehouse last October—is played, extremely skillfully, for laughs and the very opposite of laughs. There are guns on the plywood walls. Shots will be fired.
The cleverness and freshness begins with Laura Jellinek’s set, which feels like a self-enclosed barn made of plywood. On one of the warehouse’s walls is a painting of ranch houses in the dust bowl. The action takes place in a central area, with the audience watching from rows of chairs, rising on each side.
If you are sitting on the ground level at one of the tables used by the actors, prepare for confrontations, boots suddenly landing above you to dance, declarations of love, bottles being lustily thrown down, smooches, guns being cocked, and occasionally an actor’s boot or gaze landing right there in front of you.
For much of the time the house lights stay on, and so the space feels intimate and shared—as if we are there, with them—for both audience and actors. Scott Zielinski’s effective and innovative lighting design also gives us a green for night.
The sparsely decorated space—it features just some chairs and tables, with cooking pots on them—is like a runway, and the actors not in a scene sometimes recline or pace outside it before entering or saying something.
Rows of colorful bunting in pink, green, red, and gold hang above our heads. There are casserole dishes, marked “hot” on each table. (At intermission the mood continues: Avail yourself of the little bowls of chili and cornbread.)
Daniel Kluger’s orchestrations and arrangements (with music direction by Nathan Koci, and bought to life by a wonderful band of musicians) remind us of the Oklahoma! we know, but with a pared-back bluegrass feel that sparks a consistent feel of vital difference.
Daunno charms us immediately with the first song, “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’.” He wanders around the stage with an insouciant sexiness, helped immeasurable by very tight jeans and brown leather, tasseled chaps. (Terese Wadden’s stunning costumes also include acid-bright, period party dresses; as if turn of the 20th century Oklahoma might know 2018 Bushwick pretty well.)
Will Parker (James Davis) wears a similarly tight and flattering pair of brown suede chaps. Aunt Eller (the excellent Mary Testa) is both mother hen and protective grizzly; she frequently speaks for the audience, as when she tells the sexy Daunno: “If I wasn’t a ole womern, and if you wasn’t so young and smart alecky—why, I’d marry you and git you to set around at night and sing to me.” Aunt Eller wants the best suitor and future for her niece Laurey (Rebecca Naomi Jones). “When the company’s women sing ‘Many a New Day’ and ‘Out of My Dreams,’ especially the first, these are not songs of wide-eyed longing, but transformed into songs of anger and questioning.”
Jones give Laurey a commanding toughness. She and Daunno flirt with each other, drop each other, and keep each other in sight as they sing “The Surrey With the Fringe on Top” and “People Will Say We’re in Love.” Just watching them both will make you smile and blush.
When the company’s women sing “Many a New Day” and “Out of My Dreams,” especially the first, these are not songs of wide-eyed longing, but transformed into songs of anger and questioning. They meet the men on stage as sparring equals; their love is not easily won, and they are nobody’s objects.
Ali Stoker’s exquisitely naughty Ado Annie will probably remain the most familiar to fans of the musical; unapologetically sexual, she may choose, if it suits her, between Will Parker and Ali Hakim (Will Brill), a peddler who may come to regret arriving in town to trick people out of money with his talk of Persia and fancy fabrics.
Stoker made history in 2015 as the first actress in a wheelchair to appear on a Broadway stage, and here that chair is put to as whiz-bang effect as just another part of Oklahoma! ’s vital choreography. We absolutely believe she is the “girl who cain’t say no.” The singing of the company in numbers like “The Farmer and the Cowman,” “All er Nuthin’,” and “Kansas City,” and the men’s “It's a Scandal! It’s an Outrage!” is clear, delicious.
As with the musical choices, John Heginbotham’s choreography combines traditional hoedown and modern ballet, particularly in Gabrielle Hamilton’s appearance at the opening of act two to an ear-splitting rock score distillation of the movie’s “ballet scene” that emerges out of a dream of Laurey’s, which features abbreviated versions of the musical’s standards.
In the film, Laurey imagines herself the romantic object of a fighting Curly and Jud, as a tornado churns behind all three of them. Here Hamilton, who is black and wearing a shirt with the slogan “Dream Baby Dream,” throws herself viscerally all over the stage space, perhaps culturally owning, or insisting on owning, a space that at the turn of the century is not hers, but maybe in the future that her slogan-ed dress suggests. There is no sense that she is anyone’s object, but every sense she is demanding a space for herself, and significantly alighting upon the other actors of color. “He is both the outsider of Western myth and also an outsider we know today, so displaced and isolated that they remain a danger to the community.”
Vaill as Jud has a sallow menace, particularly in his final scenes in hideous brown suit and gray slip-ons. Laurey is terrified of him; he is stalking her and is like a hipster villain, a grungy heel rather than burly storm of chaos. Vaill’s Jud has a wellspring of hurt and anger that engages one’s sympathy. He is both the outsider of Western myth and also an outsider we know today, so displaced and isolated that they remain a danger to the community.
He and Curly sing “Poor Jud Is Daid” together, and then Vaill “Lonely Room” by himself, his hollow, tormented face filmed and projected on to one of the theater’s walls. As well as a mutual loathing, they have an affinity with each other; at first it seems Jud returns to kill, and then he seems to want to be killed.
Who Jud is, and what his motivation and fate means, lends itself to the most radical themes of the production: What place and function does a community have with a Jud in its midst?
The company deconstructs elements of the musical as it goes, but never more thoroughly than at its end. No spoilers here, but if you ever wondered about that gallop to a happy ending following a wedding, a hearty rendition of the famous, O- , “Oklahoma!,” then a murder, Fish and his actors disassemble those blurred parts to something deeper and more unsettling.
What justice means, who gets to dispense it, and why they should when a wrongdoing has been committed is uneasily examined. We, like Cord Elam (Anthony Cason), knows something is being done wrongly, but if he says so too loudly, the community will eject him.
The company singing a gorgeous reprise of “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’” at the end here feels mournful, unsettling, a sticking plaster on a raw wound that is all the more visible with the blood spattering the chief characters.
This didn’t stop two women in my sight line merrily singing along to themselves, when all around them there were stunned and uneasy faces.
To be clear: You won’t leave the show feeling miserable, but neither will you be slapping your knees. But this production of Oklahoma! feels less “dark” than sensibly and successfully inquisitive. Fish and his cast ask reasoned questions of a musical that has contained all these questions in plain sight for many years—and in this Oklahoma! those questions are answered with vivid, pugnacious confidence.
This is an amended review of what first appeared on Oct. 7, 2018. READ THIS LIST"
Dick Wolf’s ‘Murder for Hire’ Is Your Next True Crime Addiction,www.thedailybeast.com,Joseph.Longo@thedailybeast.com (Joseph Longo),04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dick-wolfs-murder-for-hire-about-contract-killings-is-your-next-true-crime-addiction,"CRIME DOESN'T PAY Dick Wolf’s ‘Murder for Hire’ Is Your Next True Crime Addiction ‘Law & Order’ mastermind Dick Wolf is behind Oxygen’s latest true crime series, which follows the world of contract killings. It’s a lethal success for the network. 04.07.19 6:30 PM ET Oxygen
All Cynthia Guy-Thomas wanted was her ex-husband dead. So on May 20, 2014, she met with “Frankie”—a supposed member of a Mexican drug cartel—who promised to kill Terry Thomas in exchange for $4,000.
On a gravel road next to a railway in Glendo, Wyoming, Guy-Thomas handed over $2,000 in cash. She’d provide the other half once the job was done. As the two finished up, “Frankie” asked Guy-Thomas if she was sure she wanted her ex-husband killed. “He’d fucked with my children. I’m a mother hen through and through. And I’ve been planning this for six months,” Guy-Thomas replied, before exiting the truck and making her way back home.
Five years later, Terry is still alive and so is Guy-Thomas—but she’s serving 20 to 25 years for solicitation of aggravated kidnapping of her ex-husband.
Guy-Thomas is the latest convict to receive the true crime treatment by way of Oxygen’s new series Murder for Hire , premiering April 7. Produced by Law & Order ’s Dick Wolf , the series explores the world of contract killings. They start with Guy-Thomas’ story before jumping into future episodes on wealthy bankers, military officers and even grandmothers—all out for blood.
For the past few years, Oxygen has focused on becoming the go-to true crime channel , promising salacious docuseries with equally dramatic names like Criminal Confessions , Dying to Belong and It Takes a Killer . Almost immediately they were scooped by Netflix, who is undeniably leading the genre with glossy longform programming like Wild Wild Country , The Keepers and its first big hit: Making a Murderer .
With Murder for Hire , Oxygen might have finally found the right niche in this increasingly crowded TV world of serialized true crime. Importantly, they solved cable TV’s conundrum of the commercial break. Sticking to hour-long capsule episodes affords the show maximum drama without falling victim to overly-repeating plotlines after every break. It helps that Guy-Thomas’ crime is pretty straightforward. In one 2014 week, she goes from unassuming therapist to attempted murderer.
Guy-Thomas’ crime starts in her office at the Central Wyoming Counseling Center. There, she reportedly told a court-ordered therapy patient in drug rehab to help kill her husband or she’ll send them back to prison. The patient, fearing for her future, quickly contacted the Casper Police Department, who decide their undercover agent known as “Frankie” would pretend to be the patient’s cousin—a hit man affiliated with a Mexican cartel. The patient returns to Guy-Thomas’ office and secretly records her plotting to cover up her husband’s possible murder. On the tape, Guy-Thomas mused that making the murder look like a suicide “would be perfect.”
She and Terry married after a whirlwind seven-month courtship in 2004. What started as a loving marriage full of family vacations—alongside Guy-Thomas’ children from a previous relationship—soon devolved into living in separate houses and disputing over finances. Terry alleges in the episode that his ex-wife secretly transferred as much as $100,000 from his bank account. He claims her desire to destroy him financially escalated into wanting him dead.
Murder for Hire is a simple yet engrossing tale of state and federal agents chronicling their sting operation and eventual arrest of Guy-Thomas. The audio recordings, family photos and even hidden camera footage of the money transaction between Guy-Thomas and “Frankie” keep the story worth watching. At times, details are glossed over—like how did the state agents manage to hide in an equipment closet at the counseling center and record the client conversation without being spotted?
Luckily, the story never really loses its direction. The morning after meeting with Guy-Thomas, “Frankie” texts her, “I went to the gym, and the workout was really easy.” The text was code that he’d killed Terry. Upon seeing the text, Guy-Thomas was supposed to promptly meet “Frankie” at the nearby Wind River Hotel and Casino to fork over the remaining $2,000, where the FBI planned to arrest her. She never responded and never left home. “Due to all of these life-altering events, I temporarily lost my moral compass.”
This left the FBI with no choice but to knock on her door and pose as the bearers of the death notice. She believed them and agreed to come to the county jail to provide anecdotal testimony on Terry. It’s only after being sequestered in an interrogation room that Guy-Thomas realized the jig was up, and she was promptly arrested.
Murder for Hire doesn’t explore much of the court case but Wyoming newspaper The Billings Gazette did in March 2014 . “I never thought I’d be standing in a courtroom in handcuffs and shackles,” Guy-Thomas told the court, before explaining how her life spiraled after the divorce, including financial debt and a totaled car. “Due to all of these life-altering events, I temporarily lost my moral compass.”
While their subject may have lost her moral standing, Murder for Hire never does. They end the story swiftly, with just a few lines from Terry admitting that in some ways his ex-wife won. “I was, still am and probably always will be traumatized,” he says in the documentary.
With the influx of true crime projects this year, not all shows have managed to stand out without sensationalizing their stories, discrediting victims or uplifting the criminal masterminds. Some have succeeded, like HBO’s documentary The Case Against Adnan Syed and Hulu’s scripted tale The Act , while Netflix’s Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes and even Oxygen’s own Uncovered: The Cult of Yahweh Ben Yahweh hit the wrong tones.
It remains to be seen where exactly Murder for Hire will land with its subsequent episodes—and if any of the crimes they explore are full-fledged executions. But if their handling of Guy-Thomas’ story is any indication, Oxygen may have a real hit on its hands. READ THIS LIST"
Homeland Security Chief Kirstjen Nielsen Resigns After Trump Flogged Her Over Border Security,www.thedailybeast.com,jackie.kucinich@thedailybeast.com (Jackie Kucinich) Scott.Bixby@thedailybeast.com (Scott Bixby) Erin.Banco@thedailybeast.com (Erin Banco),04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/homeland-security-chief-kirstjen-nielsen-resigned-after-trump-flogged-her-over-border-security,"04.07.19 6:06 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned from her position on Sunday evening, after serving 16 turbulent months as the nation’s top national security official and the president's punching bag on border security.
Nielsen’s immediate departure comes only two days after President Donald Trump announced that he was withdrawing the nomination of Ronald D. Vitiello to head U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Homeland Security agency tasked with enforcing Trump’s border policy, in favor of a “tougher” nominee who has yet to be named.
Trump lambasted the current enforcement of American immigration laws for years, and as the nation’s top immigration and national security official, those laws and their implementation fell under Nielsen’s purview.
In a tweet, President Trump said Nielsen “will be leaving her position,” and announced that Kevin McAleenan, the current U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner, will become acting secretary as he searches for a permanent replacement.
In her resignation letter, Nielsen appeared to lay partial blame on Congress for failing to provide the Department of Homeland Security with “all the tools and resources... to execute the mission.”
“I hope that the next Secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impended our ability to fully secure America’s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation’s discourse,” Nielsen wrote.
Nielsen’s ouster comes amid a continuing—even continuous—shakeup in the Trump administration. The president cleaned house after the midterm elections, ditching former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other officials he viewed as disloyal or unwilling to cooperate on strategy.
Officials inside the Department of Homeland Security told The Daily Beast that they have speculated Nielsen would be out of a job sometime after the midterms. Nielsen, Trump and National Security Adviser John Bolton have often quarreled about the department’s strategy on immigration, officials said, and Nielsen is regularly chastised for not taking a tough enough stance on border security.
One former department official told The Daily Beast that Trump’s decision to replace Nielsen with the head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection was indicative of the president’s superficial understanding of immigration and national security policy.
“Just because there’s a new man at the helm of DHS, the border crisis will be fixed?! Ha!” the official said in a text. “They think just because he’s former CBP, and he understands the border, he’ll fix it? I don’t think so.”
Plus, the official added, “getting a man is so stereotypical!”
Nielsen was one of three women in Trump’s cabinet.
Internally, staffers and officials said Nielsen was viewed by some as too loyal to the president, often catering to his demands despite the legal implications. Officials said Nielsen’s public rhetoric on immigration and asylum is crafted specifically to cater to President Trump.
The general focus of the department has changed drastically under Nielsen’s leadership, too, officials said. Over the past year, most of the department’s high-level briefings and meetings have centered around threats by foreign actors, particularly those from South America. At the same time, the department has drawn back from looking at threats posed by people living in the U.S. who have the potential to carry out mass casualty attacks, the officials said.
Even after shootings in Pittsburgh and California, the department continued to focus more of its attention on border security and migrant caravans, DHS staffers told The Daily Beast.
In news briefings compiled for the secretary and her senior staff over a three-week period obtained by The Daily Beast, the secretary was shown to have overwhelmingly received news updates on migrant caravans and Trump’s remarks on immigration enforcement, despite two mass shootings and security concerns about midterm elections at the time.
The top of the press packet compiled and distributed on November 9, 2018, the day after the shooting in Thousand Oaks, reads: “Administration Moves To Require Asylum Seekers To Go To Designated Ports Of Entry.” Under that section, the briefing quotes and bolds a Breitbart headline: “Fewer than 10 percent of Central American Migrants Arriving At Border Have Legitimate Asylum Claim.”
Out of about 19 pages of quoted media text, one and a half focused on the California shooting, three and a half on border security and immigration and six on the Mueller investigation. The rest of the pages touched on news about cybersecurity, terrorism investigations and other DHS-related topics.
Despite that near-myopic focus on immigration, the president has reportedly been frustrated with Nielsen’s enforcement of some of his more controversial border policies for some time, most notably the chaotic implementation and eventual reversal of its family separation policy in late spring. At the time, Nielsen told reporters that the policy didn’t even exist— “period” —even as the government held hundreds of undocumented minor children who had forcibly been taken from their parents.
Nielsen was reportedly berated by President Trump in a Cabinet meeting in May 2018 over his perception that she was not doing enough to keep the southern border secure. The verbal flogging, detailed by The New York Times , prompted Nielsen to draft a resignation letter which she ultimately decided not to deliver.
Both the Department of Homeland Security and Nielsen herself denied she planned to step aside at the time.
For months, Nielsen soldiered on, testifying to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, where she defended the administration's new, controversial policy of separating children from their parents if they cross the border illegally, even if they are claiming asylum. Trump, according to the Times report, had suspected Nielsen along was privately resisting his order to implement this policy as a deterrent.
“Our policy is if you break the law, we will prosecute you,” Nielsen said. “You have an option to go to a port of entry and not illegally cross into our country.”
As she left the hearing, she answered a reporter’s question as to her future.
“I have not resigned, I didn’t threaten to resign,” she said, according to Politico .
Nielsen, a cybersecurity expert who previously worked in the George W. Bush administration, is a protégée of Gen. John F. Kelly, whom she replaced at the top of Homeland Security in early December."
Billionaire Ukrainian Oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky Under Investigation by FBI,www.thedailybeast.com,betsy.woodruff@thedailybeast.com (Betsy Woodruff),04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/billionaire-ukrainian-oligarch-ihor-kolomoisky-under-investigation-by-fbi,"EXCLUSIVE Billionaire Ukrainian Oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky Under Investigation by FBI Ihor Kolomoisky, who’s been accused of ordering contract killings and is said to be behind the comic who may win Ukraine’s presidency, is being probed for alleged financial crimes. exclusive Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters
The FBI is investigating Ihor Kolomoisky, a Ukrainian oligarch who has sparred with the country’s current president, according to three people briefed on the probe.
The investigators are scrutinizing potential financial crimes, including money laundering, according to the sources, who say the probe is wide-ranging and has been under way for quite some time. Kolomoisky has not been charged with any crime, and a lawyer representing him said he denies any wrongdoing.
“Mr. Kolomoisky categorically denies that he has laundered any funds into the United States, period,” said Mike Sullivan, an attorney with the Ashcroft Law Firm who represents Kolomoisky. “He’s a businessperson. His bank was seized by the government, claiming the bank was on the verge of collapse. That information turned out to be false.”
The U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Northern District of Ohio is involved in the probe, as Kolomoisky has investments there, according to the Kyiv Post .
The oligarch, whose net worth Forbes places at $1.2 billion, lives in Tel Aviv, according to the FT . Law enforcement experts say his residency there could complicate any potential extradition attempt by the United States.
The news comes at a dramatic moment in Ukrainian politics. On March 31, comedian Volodymyr Zelensky won the first round in the presidential election and will face incumbent Petro Poroshenko in a runoff on April 21. Zelensky is famous for starring in a Ukrainian sitcom called Servant of the People , now streaming on Netflix, as a schoolteacher who inadvertently becomes the country’s president.
Kolomoisky owns the TV channel that airs Zelensky’s show, and Poroshenko has called him “a puppet of Kolomoisky.” Zelensky’s ascent, meanwhile, has worried some Western Ukraine-watchers and government officials; the comedian said in 2014 that he would “go down on his knees” to beg Russian President Vladimir Putin to keep his hands off Ukraine, as AFP reported .
Kolomoisky’s reputation is complicated. After the Euromaidan revolution ousted then-President Viktor Yanukovych (known best in the U.S. as a client of Paul Manafort’s ), Kolomoisky became governor of an eastern province that bordered territory seized by pro-Russian separatists. He helped fund troops fighting the separatists and, according to The Wall Street Journal , offered a $10,000 bounty for some captured fighters. His efforts won him plaudits.
“He is known for doing things in the gray area,” said Ilya Ponomarev, a Russian politician who voted against the annexation of Crimea and now lives in exile in Kyiv . “On the other hand, he’s the most pro-Ukrainian and anti-Kremlin oligarch. He played a key role in stopping the invasion in 2014.”
Jonathan Brunson, who worked at the U.S. embassy in Kiev and was senior analyst on Ukraine for the Crisis Group, took a different view.
“I think Kolomoisky is super-dangerous,” he said. “He is probably one of the most dangerous oligarchs because he’s one of the ones who’s willing to get his hands dirty.”
Brunson pointed to Kolomoisky’s role in funding the ultra-far-right Azov battalion , a group of Ukrainian fighters alleged to have ties to American white supremacists, per RFE/RL ; the State Department has called its political wing a “nationalist hate group,” and human rights workers say it may be a haven for neo-Nazis.
“He was one of the first oligarchs who began to act like a warlord,” Brunson said.
Kolomoisky has a host of enemies. He’s been accused of commissioning contract killings . And in 2016, Ukraine’s central bank nationalized Kolomoisky’s PrivatBank because it didn’t have enough cash. Billions of dollars disappeared from its coffers because it lent so much to Kolomoisky associates, according to the FT . The move was widely viewed in the West as a victory for transparency and good governance, in a country whose politics are impoverished on both counts. It was a flashpoint in Kolomoisky’s relationship with Poroshenko, and many speculate the oligarch backs Zelensky in part because hopes to depose the president who oversaw the takeover of his bank.
Vladislav Davidzon, editor-in-chief of the Odessa Review and previously a correspondent for a TV station Kolomoisky owned, said the oligarch handled the nationalization of his bank in a responsible way.
“When in 2016 the government was ready to nationalize and restructure PrivatBank, which was a tremendous economic liability, there was a serious concern that the irate Kolomoisky would use the bank’s leading position to crater the infrastructure of the Ukrainian banking sector,” he said. “That did not happen. He is a fantastic and picaresque character who by comparison puts about half the villains in James Bond films to shame with his antics.”
Others say the oligarch’s support for Zelensky is an effort at revenge.
“Kolomoisky was just looking for somebody to humiliate Poroshenko, and he found this guy,” Brunson said.
Sullivan, the lawyer who represents Kolomoisky, downplayed his role in Zelensky’s ascent.
“It should come as a surprise to no one that there is serious ongoing corruption in the Ukraine and now the government is at a crossroads in terms of a new election,” he said. “The present regime in the Ukraine is concerned about the potential will of the people in electing a new president. And the current president obviously sees Mr. Kolomoisky as a serious threat to his ability to retain power in the Ukraine. He believes that Mr. Kolomoisky is behind the opposition in Ukraine. It’s the people who are behind the opposition, not Mr. Kolomoisky.”
Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, put it this way: “Kolomoisky is a complete opportunist. He’s only interested in one thing: money.”"
"Kirstjen Nielsen Was Heartless, but Not Heartless Enough for Trump",www.thedailybeast.com,michael.tomasky@thedailybeast.com (Michael Tomasky),04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kirstjen-nielsen-as-department-of-homeland-security-secretary-was-heartless-but-not-heartless-enough-for-trump,"opinion Bloomberg/Getty
So Kirstjen Nielsen, whose legacy will be the most heartless and lawbreaking immigration policy this nation has known in at least 70 years, wasn’t heartless and lawbreaky enough for Donald Trump, who accepted her resignation Sunday evening so he can move immigration policy in “a tougher direction.”
Hard to imagine what kinds of border moves this foretells. Gotta treat those people worse. Trump thinks they’re all a bunch of criminals anyway, down to the 3-year olds, so I take it what we’ve seen to this point has been pussy-footing. I’m sure Stephen Miller spent Sunday night giddily writing up a list. Out: Mylar blankets. In: surplus Soviet-era sandpaper bath sheets.
A while back, you’ll recall, Trump shut down the government for the longest period in American history ( remember? Everyone’s forgotten!) because there was a “crisis” at the border that existed in his head but not in real life. But that was then. Now, there actually is a crisis at the border, as you may have read. Detentions are way up, to highs not seen in many years.
But it’s a crisis largely of Trump’s making. We—yes, we; you and I, in whose name these hideous people are acting—are spending billions of dollars separating families and keeping kids in cages, billions that could have been spent trying to fix the asylum system. Trump is, we must concede, right about that—the asylum processing system is horrible, with a million-case backlog. But he has just made it worse. We could have been spending those billions trying to speed the process along.
But that’s no fun. That’s called governing. That’s making responsible decisions and treating human beings with some basic minimum level of dignity. And Trump has no time for nonsense like that.
In virtually every area of governance, Trump’s “policies,” such as they are, are entirely symbolic in the most reactionary and mean-spirited possible way, proceeding from a set of assumptions that make Archie Bunker look like William F. Buckley. And then, from there, he has his people go enforce the most extreme positions imaginable. Israel is good, Palestinians are bad. So, cut off every kind of aid to the Palestinians they can think of, more than $200 million worth, even including the paltry $25 million we give to hospitals that serve Palestinians. You’re a Palestinian in East Jerusalem with cancer? Well, tough. You’re probably a terrorist of some kind or another. Go die.
There are many examples of this, but in no policy area is it worse than immigration. They’re all criminals, hustlers, rapists. Remember at his announcement of candidacy when he said that famous line about all the immigrant rapists? At least, then, he followed that with a sentence that went: “And some, I assume, are good people.” Now, even that afterthought-ish sentiment is gone.
Americans don’t like this. Make no mistake about that. When the border policy was initiated in 2018, polls showed that people overwhelmingly opposed the policy. A Quinnipiac poll in June 2018 found 66 percent of respondents against the policy and only 27 percent in support. But lo and behold, Republicans backed it, 55 to 35, and to Trump, that’s all that matters. Only Republicans are Americans, because only Republicans agree with Trump. People are against the wall, too. Opposition to that usually registers in the high 50s to low 60s. But this too makes no difference to Trump.
Now a typical president approaching his reelection fight would canter a bit toward the center, try to look like he was interested in compromise even if he actually wasn’t, to win over a majority of the swing vote. Bill Clinton signed welfare reform when he was running for reelection. Neither George W. Bush nor Barack Obama did anything that dramatic, but both made small but telling gestures toward the center. That’s what incumbent presidents do.
Not this one. If Trump were a normal president, he’d throw a bone in the direction of the idea that we are the United States of America, we’re the shining city on the hill, we’re the beacon of hope, and we’re going to treat people driven here by desperate circumstances decently. Instead, he’s headed in the opposite direction. It’s time to crank up the mean.
And as for Nielsen, well, keep your eye open for summaries of her tenure that strain to explain what a “difficult situation” she found herself in and how she “did her best” under impossible circumstances. Bullshit. She was awful. If there’s any justice in this world, she will spend her coming days thinking twice before traveling overseas for fear of being arrested for crimes against humanity. If the Netherlands was high on Nielsen’s bucket list, she’s badly out of luck.
Nielsen has experienced what so many others have, what Bill Barr is living now. You choose to become part of Trumpworld, you leave corrupted and polluted. Reduced to his level. Yet somehow I just know that after holing up for a year or so, she’ll be back on the Washington bagel circuit, appearing on Heritage Foundation panels.
But she’s not our main concern. Our main concern is the human beings fleeing violence and risking everything to come to this country and enter through a legal process . Nielsen, as ghastly a figure as she was, was the buffer between them on the one hand and Trump and Miller on the other. One shudders to imagine what the next few months hold for these folks.

"Princess Diana Died of a Tiny Injury Which Should Never Have Killed Her, Says Top U.K. Pathologist",www.thedailybeast.com,tom.sykes@thedailybeast.com (Tom Sykes),04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/princess-diana-died-of-a-tiny-injury-which-should-never-have-killed-her-says-top-uk-pathologist,"If Only Princess Diana Died of a Tiny Injury Which Should Never Have Killed Her, Says Top U.K. Pathologist A small tear to a vein in her lung killed Princess Diana, says a new book by Britain’s top forensic pathologist. 04.08.19 2:54 AM ET DAVE GAYWOOD
The U.K.’s top forensic pathologist has said that Princess Diana died due to a tiny tear in a vein in one of her lungs, and would almost certainly have survived the 1997 Paris car crash that killed her had she been wearing a seat belt or had the car been traveling at a slightly slower speed.
Dr Richard Shepherd, who has performed over 23,000 post-mortems, examined the evidence as part of a British police inquiry into her death called Operation Paget. He reviews his findings in a new book, Unnatural Causes , excerpted in The Daily Mail .
According to Dr Shepherd, Diana “actually suffered just a few broken bones and a small chest injury, but this included a tiny tear in a vein in one of her lungs.”
Although her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, who was seated next to her in the back of the car, was killed instantly, Diana was not because her bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, who was sitting in front of her, was, unusually, wearing a safety belt.
“Bodyguards don’t usually wear seat belts as they restrict movement, but evidently Rees-Jones, maybe because he was alarmed by Henri Paul’s driving, or maybe because he realized an impact was likely, put on his belt at the last minute,” Shepherd writes in The Mail .
“Belts are designed to give gradually while they restrain. So he was held by the belt and partially padded by the car’s airbag, which by now had inflated, as Diana’s body catapulted forward from the back seat. She was much lighter than Dodi and Rees-Jones’s belt would have absorbed some of the extra force. This slightly lessened the energy of the impact for her.
“She actually suffered just a few broken bones and a small chest injury—but this included a tiny tear in a vein in one of her lungs.
“To the ambulance services, she initially seemed injured but stable, particularly as she was able to communicate. While everyone focused on Rees-Jones, however, the vein was slowly bleeding into her chest.
“In the ambulance, she gradually lost consciousness. When she suffered a cardiac arrest, every effort was made to resuscitate her and in hospital she went into surgery, where they did identify the problem and attempted to repair the vein. But, sadly, by then it was too late.”
Shepherd said that Diana’s injury was “very small” just “in the wrong place”, adding that there were multiple ‘if onlys’ that could have prevented her death.
“If only she had hit the seat in front at a slightly different angle. If only she had been thrown forward 10mph more slowly. If only she had been put in an ambulance immediately. But the biggest if only, in Diana’s case, was within her own control.
“If only she had been wearing a seat belt. Had she been restrained, she would probably have appeared in public two days later with a black eye, perhaps a bit breathless from the fractured ribs and with a broken arm in a sling.” READ THIS LIST"
John Oliver Breaks Down Why Trump Nominating ‘Alleged Sexual Harasser’ Herman Cain to the Fed Is Dangerous,www.thedailybeast.com,marlow.stern@thedailybeast.com (Marlow Stern),04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-oliver-breaks-down-why-trump-nominating-alleged-sexual-harasser-herman-cain-to-the-federal-reserve-is-so-dangerous,"‘Alleged Sexual Harasser’ John Oliver Breaks Down Why Trump Nominating ‘Alleged Sexual Harasser’ Herman Cain to the Fed Is Dangerous “These two guys are just goofs—they’re a pair of dangerously goofy goofs—and this isn’t actually a job where that’s OK,” explained the ‘Last Week Tonight’ host. 04.08.19 2:45 AM ET HBO
On Sunday night, John Oliver didn’t address the recent news of DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s resignation —his show tapes earlier in the day, as it were—but instead dedicated the opening portion of Last Week Tonight to Trump’s recently announced plan to nominate Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve Board.
“In between claiming his father was born in Germany when he was born in New York, mispronouncing the word ‘origins’ as ‘oranges’ repeatedly, and trolling Joe Biden for touching women inappropriately, which seems, you know, a bit fucking rich, Trump made a major and shocking decision on Thursday regarding the Federal Reserve,” Oliver said.
Yes, he nominated Herman Cain—the former Godfather’s Pizza CEO, Pokemon -movie quoter , Anita Hill joke-maker , ex-Fox News contributor, and man who was forced to drop out of the 2012 presidential race after five women accused him of sexual misconduct.
“You think the résumé of a pizza maker, talk-show host and alleged sexual harasser would be pretty unusual for the Fed? Well, why don’t you tell that to the rest of the board: six Mario Batalis,” joked Oliver. “But it is true: picking Herman Cain for the Federal Reserve is bonkers , and it comes just two weeks after Trump also said he’d nominate Stephen Moore, a TV commentator and fellow at a conservative think tank.”
Oliver then threw to a clip of Sarah Bloom Raskin, the former U.S. deputy secretary of the Treasury and Federal Reserve Board member, who said of Trump’s nominations: “It’s one thing to be putting your political friends and cronies within the agencies, but to put them on the board of the central bank is something that has to be done very, very cautiously, because the moment the Fed loses credibility it’s almost game over.”
Yikes . “You don’t fuck around with the Fed—and that is because a lot of America’s economic power depends in people’s trust in the stability of the dollar. It is the world’s reserve currency in part because the Fed is seen as a reliable, independent institution,” Oliver explained. “Trump has actually already filled four of the Fed’s seven seats, including the chairman Jerome Powell, but those appointments didn’t get much press because all of these people are fundamentally qualified. Cain and Moore, however, are not . Cain has argued for a return to the gold standard—a virtually unheard-of opinion among respected economists—while Moore is a tireless advocate of supply-side economics, he helped design the tax cuts that blew a hole in Kansas’ budget, and he once asked if the country even really ‘needs a Fed.’”
“These two guys are just goofs—they’re a pair of dangerously goofy goofs—and this isn’t actually a job where that’s OK,” he added. “Fed Board members are famously careful with anything they say in public because markets can react violently. Just two words from the Fed chair sent markets soaring last November… And these two are not known for thinking before they speak.”"

The United Kingdom has revealed a landmark plan for holding tech companies responsible for spreading violent content, The Washington Post reports Sunday. The plan, which has the backing of Prime Minister Theresa May, would allow the British government to fine or otherwise penalize tech companies like Facebook and Google if they don’t immediately act to remove violent content like child exploitation, terrorism and graphic violence. The plan also targets what the Post describes as “false news.” Officials say the move would constitute “world leading laws to make the U.K. the safest place in the world to be online.” It also raises a series of questions that would be even more unprecedented, asking lawmakers to weigh if tech CEO’s should be held directly liable or if regulators should have the power to restrict access to particularly egregious content. “The era of self-regulation for online companies is over,” the nation’s digital secretary said in a Sunday statement."

"In Venezuelas Thug State, Even the Morgues Dont Work",www.thedailybeast.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/in-venezuelas-thug-state-even-the-morgues-dont-work,"In Venezuela’s Thug State, Even the Morgues Don’t Work Courtesy Roman Camacho Every actor who should have your back is either on the take or on the make, and all the basic features of society have been torn to shreds. 04.08.19 4:40 AM ET
C ARACAS, Venezuela—“Manuel’s mother died last night.”
This is what my friend texted me this morning, telling me about our colleague’s loss.
I’m just about to text my condolences when the phone pings again, and I see something I’ll never be able to unsee.
The body of a woman, covered by a thin white sheet, spread out on an old maroon couch. Next to her are plastic bottles that once contained some sort of off-brand soda, now filled with frozen water and used to keep the body of my friend’s mother from rotting in the heat.
I have spent almost two months in Venezuela and seen more atrocities than I expected in a lifetime, but this, this complete loss of human dignity, may be the worst yet.
A few weeks ago I visited a public hospital here in Caracas and next to it I saw the barred-up doors of the central morgue, closed for weeks because they lacked both refrigeration and personnel. At the time I was wondering what happened to a society with no means to care for the dead and now I have the answer, staring back at me from the screen of my phone.
The debate over Venezuela, especially in international media, has been a referendum on socialism and a way to reflect one’s own views off the surface of a broken country. As with everything else in this time of angry discourse and heightened rhetoric, Venezuela has become a partisan issue and a faraway place that can serve as a blunt ideological instrument with which one can bludgeon one’s enemies. And I’m guilty of that, along with the rest of them, or at least I was a few weeks ago. I came here to see the end of Socialism but what I found was something much more complicated and heartbreaking. “ Her son is cooling her dead body with ice-filled plastic bottles as he cries tears of anger, impotence and loss. ”
Venezuela is more than poverty, starvation and hyperinflation, much more than a dictatorship or political policies gone awry. This country suffers under a thug-state, where every actor that should have your back is either on the take or on the make and all the basic features of society have been torn to shreds. The result is a humanitarian disaster that has its people in a state of arrested development, unable to predict the next day or even the next couple of hours, while those who claim to know better debate their fate in forums that the Manuels of this world will never have access to.
Manuel can’t afford the cost of the cremation and funeral, a total of almost US$300, so his friends have pooled all their belongings to help him lay his last remaining relative to rest. In a country where 85 percent of the population lives beneath the poverty line of $6 a month, that amount of money is usually impossible to come by, and most end up burying their relatives where they can, as anonymously as most of them have lived.
The woman beneath the sheet is tiny, more like a teenage girl than an old woman, the only giveaway being a strand of gray hair just at the edge of the cloth’s yellowing embroidery. She spent her last 20 years watching the country she loved decay and her life along with it, and now her son is cooling her dead body with ice-filled plastic bottles as he cries tears of anger, impotence and loss.
It has been said that a society is judged by how it cares for those who cannot care for themselves, and by this measure Venezuela is truly a failed state. During my weeks here I have seen how the oldest and the youngest die in the streets from starvation and treatable diseases and now I am witnessing the most vulnerable of all–the lifeless body of a mother–meeting her maker with neither mercy nor grace.
These are the stories that go untold, as their actors are trapped in quiet anonymity. We journalists like to focus on the geopolitical implications, the rival leaders and the impending civil war but here, on an old couch in Caracas, lie the final consequences of this crisis. Manuel lost his mother and that should be enough for one young man to carry, but now in a country without even the most basic of resources, he carries the entire world.
It took two decades to get here: from the richest country in the region to a post-apocalyptic state. Two decades to get to a place where the living lack hope and the dead have no names. The people of Venezuela are prisoners of a political war, constantly being used as either tools or bad examples, and what they are owed now is to be helped without partisanship or prejudice.
I came here thinking I was witnessing a trial over political territory but now, two months later, I think it may be a test for humanity. The test is to learn how to see beyond individual leaders and old alliances and go back to the core belief that every human being deserves freedom and self-determination; shifting focus from what it would cost parties and politicians to support this people’s fight for freedom to what it costs these people if they don’t. And it seems as if the world may be failing that test now, right when it matters the most, by making Venezuela a symbol and allowing the faces of each person behind this tragedy to blur and become irrelevant.
Before I get the chance to reach out to Manuel, the electricity goes out again, for the fifth time in as many days. This national blackout along with a chronic water shortage is bringing an already crippled country to its knees. For Manuel, it means he will sit with his mother through the night in darkness, until she is taken away to a burial that he cannot afford.
The signal is out now, so I can’t reach my friend but even if I could I wouldn’t know how to console him. What are the words for what he is going through? What phrase can I utter to take away the pain of what is still to come? There is nothing to say and no way to say it, only silence and darkness as Manuel sits in wait by his mother’s side."
Federal Watchdog Probes Trump Administration Push for Saudi Arabia Nuclear Deal,www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/federal-watchdog-probes-trump-administration-push-for-saudi-arabia-nuclear-deal,"RADIOACTIVE Federal Watchdog Probes Trump Admin Push for Saudi Nuke Deal In 2017 Team Trump worked to clinch a nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia—and an independent investigative agency wants to know what happened behind closed doors. 04.08.19 4:39 AM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Getty
One of the government’s top investigative agencies has looked at allegations of potential wrongdoing by individuals in the Trump administration about their planning of a nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia, according to two individuals with knowledge of the probe.
The line of inquiry is part of a broader investigation in the Office of the Special Counsel —an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency—into alleged politically motivated personnel decisions at government offices.
The OSC, which can seek corrective and disciplinary action, is looking at whether officials were retaliated againstfor raising concerns about the administration’s work related to a Saudi nuclear deal. As part of that investigation, OSC has also reviewed allegations about potentially improper dealings by senior members of the Trump administration in their attempt to map out a nuclear deal with Riyadh, according to two sources with knowledge of OSC’s work.
The details of the OSC probe, previously unreported, are the first indication that a government body other than Congress is investigating matters related to a potential nuclear deal between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. OSC declined to comment on the record for this story.
Meanwhile, there is a growing concern among lawmakers on Capitol Hill about U.S.-Saudi relations, especially following the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Those concerns were heightened by a report issued by Rep. Elijah Cummings in February that outlined allegations about efforts inside the White House to rush the transfer of highly sensitive U.S. nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia—a potential violation of the Atomic Energy Act and without review by Congress.
The Cummings report said IP3—a firm that includes former top military officers, diplomats, and energy experts—had developed a proposal for Saudi Arabia that was simply “a scheme for these generals to make some money.” That report said former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had ties to the firm during his time working in the Trump administration.
Sources with direct knowledge of the IP3 plans today say the firm is focused on providing security for nuclear-related projects and in finding ways to compete with Russia and China to secure those projects throughout the Middle East.
In the wake of the Cummings announcement, The Daily Beast reported that U.S. companies and officials in the administration were moving forward in their conversations with Riyadh about a nuclear deal and the transfer of nuclear technology.
The Department of Energy then approved seven U.S. companies to conduct nuclear-related work in Saudi Arabia. (Federal law stipulates that companies obtain clearance from the U.S. government for exporting nuclear technology to or engaging in the production or development of special nuclear material in the kingdom.)
That news has prompted intense questioning by lawmakers in hearings with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.
“One thing that is in our interest is to prevent Saudi Arabia from getting a nuclear weapon,” Rep. Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, said. “What I’ve seen in this administration recently... is an effort to evade Congress and to some extent evade your department and provide substantial nuclear technology and aid to Saudi Arabia while [the country] refuses to abide by any of the controls we would like to see regarding reprocessing, enrichment.”
A cohort of lawmakers is ready to reveal next week a new piece of legislation that would stop the Trump administration from bypassing Congress on the transfer of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.
Congress is also increasingly concerned about Jared Kushner’s relationship with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and his recent trip to Riyadh, especially because of the news that his security clearance was denied last year in part because of concerns about foreign influence. Engel is demanding a briefing from Pompeo on Kushner’s trip to Saudi Arabia last month that included a senior State Department official but otherwise left American diplomats in the dark."
Elisabeth Moss Opens Up About Scientology and Resisting Trump: ‘The Only Place I Can Speak From Is My Own’,www.thedailybeast.com,marlow.stern@thedailybeast.com (Marlow Stern),04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/elisabeth-moss-opens-up-about-scientology-and-resisting-trump-the-only-place-i-can-speak-from-is-my-own,"Travel IN CONVERSATION Elisabeth Moss Opens Up About Scientology and Resisting Trump: ‘The Only Place I Can Speak From Is My Own’ Matt Sayles/AP The acclaimed actress talks to Marlow Stern about her award-worthy turn as a punk rocker in ‘Her Smell,’ her controversial faith, and why ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ is so resonant. Marlow Stern 04.08.19 5:01 AM ET
S he’s been branded “The Queen of Peak TV,” with treasured roles in the series The West Wing , Mad Men and The Handmaid’s Tale (not to mention her Golden Globe-winning performance in Top of the Lake ), and this year Elisabeth Moss is poised to conquer the big screen as well.
First came her face-carving, rosé-swilling turn in Us , Jordan Peele’s stylish satire of Reagan-era negligence , which has grossed over $200 million worldwide and counting; and later this year she’ll join Melissa McCarthy and Tiffany Haddish in the ‘70s-set crime drama The Kitchen , and portray celebrated mystery author Shirley Jackson in Shirley , Josephine Decker’s anticipated follow-up to Madeline’s Madeline .
But it will be hard for any of those roles to top Her Smell .
Her Becky Something, lead singer of the world-renowned all-female punk-rock group Something She, is a hair-trigger-tempered hellraiser whose drug-induced mood swings petrify those around her, from her bandmates (Agyness Deyn, Gayle Rankin) to her estranged husband (Dan Stevens) to her doting mother (Virginia Madsen). She is an undeniable musical talent, yes, but one whose mind is unraveling, causing her to push away or even endanger those she loves most—including her baby girl. And Moss is an absolute force of nature, throwing herself fully into the role of a thrashing, eyeliner-bleeding, devil-may-care rock goddess.
Her Smell marks the third collaboration between Moss and filmmaker Alex Ross Perry, following Listen Up Philip and Queen of Earth , and is far and away their best—a madcap monument to Moss’ singular acting ability.
I sat down with Moss during SXSW in Austin, Texas, where we discussed her long, winding road to movie stardom—and much more.
How did you and Alex come up with the idea of capturing this rocker in the Courtney Love or Kathleen Hanna mold spiraling out of control?
[Alex] had come up with this very basic idea a couple of years ago about a female rock star at the height of her career but had a baby and was an addict. He was fascinated by the image of a woman being an addict, high on drugs, holding a baby. That’s where it came from, and he said, “I’m going to write this movie and it’s mainly going to be you in a hotel room.” It was going to be really small and intimate, a lot of locked-off shots. We had this idea of putting a camera there and just letting it run.
Similar to Queen of Earth .
Exactly. Very Queen of Earth -ish. And I got the script months later and it was this five-act structure with two bands spanning many years with a gigantic cast, and I was like, “This is very different. I love it. Let’s do it.”
Speaking of the baby, those early scenes where Becky snatches the baby and disappears backstage are incredibly nerve-racking.
That baby is actually Adam’s [Piotrowicz]—our producer’s—son Clive, and he is the most intelligent, coolest child I’ve ever met in my life. The kid is a champion and absolutely adorable, so shout-out to Clive! But that was the germ of the idea that sparked the movie: this idea of a woman who loves her child so much but is in no condition to handle it, in no condition to take care of a child but has had a child anyway, and who hasn’t stopped using. Loving something and being able to take care of it are two very different things. Becky loves her child so much but because of her addiction is not able to be the mother that she needs to be for her.
Did you listen to any punk music growing up—any Hole or Bikini Kill?
Not at all . I grew up listening to classical, jazz, blues, country. I remember hearing about Nirvana but not really understanding what it was, not really listening to it. It was on the radio but not really getting it and it just wasn’t my thing at all. And so with this movie, it was a real deep dive into Bikini Kill, the Riot Grrrl movement, Kathleen Hanna, and all that.
Did you watch The Punk Singer ?
Of course! Several times.
There’s an interesting six-degrees here, since Kathleen’s husband Adam Horovitz —or Ad-Rock—starred in Alex’s Golden Exits .
Oh! Well, there you go. For me, understanding where that music came from was very important, and I actually had a conversation with my friend Beck who was extremely helpful to me in telling me where that music came from. That was really helpful, because I wanted to understand where the music came from, why these kids were so depressed, and why they were so unhappy and angry, and he talked to me a lot about that and how that generation felt—that they felt abandoned by their parents and teachers, everyone hated them, and they were mad and didn’t have anyone to talk to about it. They didn’t have this culture we have now of talking about your feelings, so they put it into music.
I understand you were into ballet, which is a very regimented lifestyle, but did you ever have a period of teenage rebellion?
I was already acting, so for me, I stopped dancing when I was 15 or 16—you had to go either way at that point, and if I went with ballet I knew I wouldn’t be able to act, and if I acted I could still possibly dance—so I went with the acting. I could imagine not dancing but I couldn’t imagine not acting. And being in a musical is my dream. But no, I didn’t really have a rebellious period because I moved to New York when I was 18, and I started West Wing when I was 17.
So did you go to Kim’s Video while Alex was working there?
Yes! But I don’t remember him. We talk about how he probably recommended some things for me, because I was there all the time and lived in the East Village for 13 years. Although I was the girl they probably hated for going in there and renting Bridget Jones’s Diary or something … but I also rented my share of foreign films!
Her Smell ’s five-act structure is interesting because each act mirrors Becky’s state of mind.
The acts almost reflect the different drugs that she’s on, and the different highs that she’s experiencing. In Act I she’s probably on the basics, and then Act II is getting into meth, Act III is everything … so they do mirror her experience, and they go as slowly or as quickly as she’s feeling. I know people always say “this was a challenge,” but this actually was pretty hard. We shot this in a month and a week after we’d wrapped The Handmaid’s Tale —because we pushed The Handmaid’s Tale back—so it was challenging. And with every act being one scene, you’re shooting 10 pages of it at a time and then moving on to the next 10. Plus I didn’t want to feel like I’d left anything on the dance floor. I wanted to feel like I’d gone all the way , so I pushed myself as far as I could go.
You and Alex have become such a formidable director-star pair. Why do you think you gel so well?
We’re very different in a lot of ways but we both want to make the same thing: films that are referential and have been inspired by previous work but that aren’t like anything else out there right now. And these are not lovable characters necessarily—characters that are extremely flawed. Alex reminds me a lot of a foreign filmmaker. I feel there are very few of them in America that are auteurs, that are making movies that are what they want to say artistically and aren’t about making money or breaking box-office records. We love pushing the envelope and have a very high threshold for that. And we have no desire to make people like us, or make them like the character. We don’t care . In fact, the more disgusted you are with the character, the more we feel we’ve done our job.
And then in the final acts of Her Smell you pull it back, and make us feel empathy for Becky.
He likes to push and I like to push but it’s my job to, regardless of how abhorrent this character is, regardless of how much you want to judge her, make you like her and understand her. That’s why this combination of the two of us works really well.
You’ve been branded “The Queen of Peak TV” but I’m curious why you think you’ve been able to be on three iconic shows—in The West Wing , Mad Men, and The Handmaid’s Tale —and still managed to avoid being typecast. When people play just one memorable TV character, audiences can have a hard time seeing them as anything but.
I take that as such a huge compliment, because to me that is just so important. I look back on actors of yesteryear, and we live in a world now that’s so different—with social media, how you have to do press for a movie because the market is so flooded—and I think that an actor should not be identified as themself; I think that an actor should be able to melt into any role. So me having autonomy is very valuable to me, because I want people to be able to see me as the character I’m playing, and I don’t want them to see me as myself. I’ve approached everything from such a character standpoint that it’s so boring to me to do the same thing. I don’t even like to do the same thing from take-to-take. I’ve done takes and had the director come up to me and say, “Oh, you did something the last time that I really liked … can you do it again?” and my response invariably is, “Well, didn’t you get it? We have that one then. I’m going to do something else now.” It’s only interesting for me to find something different. And I’ve been so lucky to be able to do that.
Being on Mad Men and The Handmaid’s Tale and playing these fiercely feminist characters, people have criticized you for being a Scientologist, which some see as being at odds with the themes of those shows—particularly Handmaid’s . I’m sure you’ve heard those criticisms before, but what do you say to those criticisms?
Listen, it’s a complicated thing because the things that I believe in, I can only speak to my personal experience and my personal beliefs. One of the things I believe in is freedom of speech. I believe we as humans should be able to critique things. I believe in freedom of the press. I believe in people being able to speak their own opinions. I don’t ever want to take that away from anybody, because that actually is very important to me. At the same time, I should hope that people educate themselves for themselves and form their own opinion, as I have. The things that I believe in personally, for me, The Handmaid’s Tale , and the ability to do something that is artistically fulfilling but is also personally fulfilling, I’ve never had that. The Handmaid’s Tale lines up so perfectly parallel with my own beliefs in freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the things that this country was actually built on. “ Whatever happens, I’m never going to take away your right to talk about something or believe something, and you can’t take away mine. ” — Elisabeth Moss
I once spoke with Neil deGrasse Tyson about Scientology and he argued that much of the criticism it receives is because it’s newer and weirder. But I’m sure you’ve heard the criticisms of Scientology—from “disconnection” to the sums of money some adherents have been forced to fork over to it. Is the argument, then, that what it’s doing is not worse than, say, what the Catholic Church has done with its systematic abuse of children? I’m curious where you stand.
Right. It’s funny, there’s two things you’re never supposed to talk about at a dinner—politics or religion—and of course I’m doing The Handmaid’s Tale , which is politics and religion, so it’s a strange situation where you’re going to be asked about these topics. I choose to express myself in my work and my art. I don’t choose to express myself about it in interviews. I don’t choose to talk about not just religion, but my personal life—who I’m dating and that kind of thing. So for me, it’s so hard to unpack in a sound bite or an interview, but I will say that the things that I truly believe in are the things that I’ve mentioned, and I think that they’re very important. I think people should be allowed to talk about what they want to talk about and believe what they want to believe and you can’t take that away—and when you start to take that away, when you start to say “you can’t think that,” “you can’t believe that,” “you can’t say that,” then you get into trouble. Then you get into Gilead. So whatever happens, I’m never going to take away your right to talk about something or believe something, and you can’t take away mine.
Scientology—especially in L. Ron Hubbard’s writings—has a history of being quite anti-LGBT.
Which is not where I stand. It’s like, it’s a lot to get into and unpack that I can’t do. But that is not my bag. I am obviously a huge feminist and huge supporter of the LGBTQ community and believe so strongly—I can’t even tell you—in people being able to do what they want to do, to love who they want to love, to be the person that they want to be—whoever that is. To me, it’s a huge reason why I love doing the show. That’s all I can say. I can’t speak to what other people believe, I can’t speak to what other people’s experiences have been. That’s where I stand and the only place I can speak from is my own.
The Handmaid’s Tale does seem remarkably in tune with the times. Just last week there was the case of an Alabama man suing an abortion clinic on behalf of an aborted fetus, as well as Georgia’s controversial “heartbeat bill.” And that powerful Super Bowl ad really brought home how much the show is seen by many as an act of resistance against this administration, and the assault on reproductive rights.
It’s an honor. We went to D.C. and shot at the Lincoln Memorial, and I find it incredibly moving what Lincoln stood for, what’s written on the walls, what those monuments stand for. The principles that this country was built on are important and we’re losing them—and perhaps we’ve already lost them. You feel a sense of responsibility and you feel honored telling this story at this time. When you’re kneeling on the steps in front of the Lincoln Memorial, you’re looking at where MLK gave his ‘I Have a Dream’ speech, you’re in the outfit of complete lack of freedom, and your president is a few blocks away arguing about putting up a wall, you can’t help but feel that you have the responsibility to tell this story, and I feel honored to be able to express what I think, what I feel, and what a lot of other people feel through what I love doing. For me, it’s an unfortunate thing. I wish this was crazy, and I wish Handmaid’s Tale was insane Game of Thrones shit and pure fantasy. I wish that were true. But it’s not.
And you’re the face of the show, which in and of itself is a tremendous responsibility.
I’m not a politician—I’m just a person, and a woman. I believe that June stands for any person—man, woman, whatever you want to identify as, whoever you want to love, whoever you want to believe—who’s had their human rights taken away, who’s been abused, or who’s felt like they didn’t have a choice, or felt like they couldn’t live the life they wanted to live. You can take the personal and make it political very quickly, and that’s my job: to put a face to the people who don’t have that, and to give a voice to the people who don’t have a voice. What’s really gratifying to me is when someone in another country—that’s far closer to Gilead than we are—who’s gay comes up to me and says, “I feel like I’ve watched the show and it’s given me hope; I feel like I’m not alone.” That, to me, is what I value. That’s important to me.
You were brilliant on Mad Men . Have you thought about how the show’s aged, amid #MeToo, Time’s Up and our current cultural climate?
It wouldn’t be so cute now, would it?
It seemed there were different camps of Mad Men viewers. There were people like myself who watched the show and respected these courageous women pushing back against this patriarchal system, and there were people who watched it as some sort of cultural wish-fulfillment fantasy, and wished America could return to those times where men behaved badly with impunity.
Totally—except I think the thing that Mad Men did is we actually did show the consequences of that behavior. We did show the consequences of drinking, smoking, infidelity, and harassing women. I think Mad Men lines up perfectly with the #MeToo movement and Time’s Up because it’s a feminist show, and if you watch the entire thing, Don starts out as the hero, the sex symbol, the guy on top, the guy you want to be, and near the end, he’s broken, he’s alone and he’s miserable. And it’s Peggy who has it all. So for me, there was a way to go with that show which is what you just said, which was like, “Oh god, that’s not very feminist!” but I think the way that Matt [Weiner] did it was brilliant because he told the story accurately and he gave the women the power.
I need to re-watch it now and see how it’s aged, but I agree.
Same with Joan, too—Christina Hendricks’ character. It’s one of the most powerful female characters ever written and one of the most harassed. That’s something that will make that show timeless, and I’m so glad it went that way. And that’s the truth: women fought back, women started to demand equal pay, women started to say “you can’t do that anymore.” Women did that. So we just followed history. "
Drinking Bacon: In Defense of Smoking Beer Slow & Low,www.thedailybeast.com,Lew Bryson,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/drinking-bacon-in-defense-of-smoking-beer-slow-and-low,"Drinking Bacon: In Defense of Smoking Beer Slow & Low Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty Our columnist explores the unheralded world of smoky brews whose history goes back hundreds of years. 04.08.19 4:42 AM ET
M y name is Lew, and I am a smoker.
I smoke salmon, nuts, ribs, pork butts, eggs (amazing!), beef tips, onions...all kinds of things. I’m not alone. Smoking has become a popular hobby and cooking method among professional and amateur pitmasters alike. It adds a rich depth and complexity that can be mild and sweet if you use cherry wood, or screaming with spice if you use mesquite and hickory.
But what about smoked beer?
Even though people enjoy all kinds of crazy beers today—pastry beers, sour beers, juicy beers, salty beers, flower beers, glitter beers—the humble smoked beer gets little love or attention.
Rauchbier, as the Germans call it in their determinedly straightforward manner—it literally translates to “smoke beer” —is a classic. Indeed, at some point in the past, almost all beers would have been somewhat smoky because of the need for wood fires to dry the malt before brewing. I talked to four brewers about why smoked beer survives, and about why they make it.
The classic smoked beer is Schlenkerla (“Shh’LENK-err-luh”), brewed in Bamberg, Germany, since 1405. The brewery is owned and run by the Trum family. Matthias Trum explains how smoked beer came from the malting process.
“Drying the malt with open fire was the common technology, prior to the invention of indirect heating systems for kilns in circa mid-17th century in England,” he said. “Indirect (i.e. non-smoky) kilns are more efficient and can be built in larger sizes. By the mid-20th century, all but two breweries had stopped making malt the old-fashioned smoky way. Only Schlenkerla and Spezial of Bamberg kept the fires burning.”
It’s a literal fire, too. I’ve been to Schlenkerla and thrown a couple beechwood logs into the kiln. The bacony barbecue smell of that small room is simply incredible, a smell that follows you all through the brewery. You realize how deeply that smoke is ingrained in the brewery when you have a sip of their light, golden Helles, and taste its delicate yet definite smoky tinge. And then Matthias tells you the secret to this beer.
“The Helles Lager does not use smoked malt directly at all,” he said, with a broad smile, “but gets its smoky notes from being brewed in the same system and from being fermented with yeast that before had fermented classic Märzen smokebeer.” It’s just that smoky in there.
That delicate tinge is enough for some folks. That’s what Colin Presby has learned in his dream job as the brewmaster for Carnival Cruise Line. Presby, who is an old friend of mine, has been brewing beer on-board a couple of specially-outfitted cruise ships for the past two years, and one of his regular brews is ParchedPig Porter.
Presby brews the porter with German beechwood-smoked malt and some malt smoked right there on board the ship in Old Hickory smokers. Yes, smokers on board a cruise ship, because the brewery is part of a Guy Fieri -themed Guy’s Pig & Anchor Smokehouse Brewhouse.
“I designed the beers to go with that great food,” said Presby. “The smoky, bacony flavor and aroma complements the similar smokiness in the meat. Smoke is a great flavor for sense memory and comparisons. I get tasting notes from guests that might mention bacon, or brisket, or a campfire. But at the same time, it’s an easy flavor to overdo. Different people have very different thresholds for smoked flavor tolerance. I aim for the smoke flavor to be present, noticeable, but not overpowering.”
Unfortunately, sometimes just knowing a beer is “smoked” can be enough to scare people off. Jack’s Abby, a rare lager specialist craft brewer in New England, calls its Smoke & Dagger a “black lager.” The only indication that it’s smoked is in the name but, of course, a craft beer’s name can be any damned thing. While it has only 10 percent smoked malt, it has still been a bit of a challenge to sell it.
“We, at one point, really thought there was an opportunity to brew a decent amount of smoked beer,” said brewery co-founder Jack Hendler, “and we were very much wrong about that assumption. The key difference between Smoke & Dagger and our other smoked beers, like Fire in the Ham, is that the smoke flavor is quite subtle. Smoke & Dagger is definitely a balanced approach to a smoked beer, where there is as much roasted, chocolatey notes as there are smoked notes.”
That brought to mind something Matthias Trum mentioned. “There is an old proverb in Bamberg: only the third Seidla (half liter) will make you appreciate classic Rauchbier. In your first Seidla, your senses are overwhelmed with the smoky flavor, and therefore have a hard time noticing the other aroma components. With the second pint this effect is wearing off a bit, and with the third pint usually one is adapted to the smoky flavors, and only then the full character of the beer presents itself.”
I’ve had the full-throated Schlenkerla Urbock, and he’s right, the beer’s real character comes through as you adapt to the smoke. I’ve also had Smoke & Dagger, and it’s easy to love, with a restrained smoke flavor that comes through more as depth, and added richness.
What I haven’t had is Hammerheart, and after talking to brewmaster Austin Lunn, I want to get to Lino Lakes, Minnesota, and remedy that. Hammerheart may make more smoky beers than any other brewer in America. There were six different ones available when I checked the tap list today.
“Smoked beers are made by a few methods,” he said, “the first being smoked malt; the second, an ingredient that imparts smoke (smoked peppers, fruits or vegetables). Even cold-smoking hops is an interesting way to add a subtle smoke aroma and flavor to beers. I have done all of these methods and they are a lot of fun. After you adjust to the initial shock of ‘Hey, this beer tastes like smoked meat,’ you can find that there is a level of complexity and character hardly found in any other type of beer. Unfortunately, a lot of folks aren’t willing to get past that initial shock, or simply find the flavor of a smoked fizzy liquid offensive.”
Lunn’s pretty philosophical about the number of smoked beers he does. “In a beer scene where fruity and juicy hop profiles are currently king, smoke seems like a bad word,” he said. “Perhaps one day, a larger majority of people will come around and show interest in smoked beer...perhaps not. I will love smoked beer just the same, and always produce it, even if it’s in my kitchen for my own enjoyment.”
If you’re not drinking smoked beer, that’s the kind of devotion you’re missing. I hear Lunn’s passion, and I think of Trum’s heritage and single-mindedness, and Hendley’s determination, and Presby’s joy, and all I can think of is how long it’s been since I last tipped up a glass of liquid smoke, a darkly rich beaker full of bacon. I could jump on Presby’s ship, run up to Massachusetts, or make a pilgrimage to the wilds of Minnesota (just kidding, Hammerheart is only half an hour from downtown Minneapolis).
But instead I think I’ll fire up the smoker, throw in a pound of Brazil nuts and a couple racks of ribs over oak and hickory, turn on some cowboy tunes, and enjoy a pint of Matthias’s Schlenkerla. Nothing like it to ease the wait needed for properly smoking food slow and low."
"‘The Best of Enemies,’ a KKK-Rehab Drama, Is This Year’s ‘Green Book’—Minus the Oscars",www.thedailybeast.com,Nick Schager,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-best-of-enemies-a-kkk-rehab-drama-is-this-years-green-book-minus-the-oscars,"UGH NOT AGAIN ‘The Best of Enemies,’ a KKK-Rehab Drama, Is This Year’s ‘Green Book’—Minus the Oscars Though “based on a true story,” this tale of a KKK president seeing the error of his ways—and bonding with a civil-right activist—feels all kinds of wrong. 04.08.19 4:41 AM ET STX Films
Less than two months after Green Book won Best Picture at the Academy Awards, Hollywood delivers yet another period piece of heartwarming racial reconciliation with The Best of Enemies . Moreover, this tale about an unlikely friendship is another clear-cut white savior narrative—the twist being that, this time around, the savior is a president of the Ku Klux Klan !
As if that didn’t complicate matters enough, The Best of Enemies is also based on a true story. Adapted from Osha Gray Davidson’s 1996’s book The Best of Enemies: Race and Redemption in the New South , writer/director Robin Bissell’s film concerns the legitimate miracle that took place in Durham, North Carolina, in 1971, when ( inevitable spoiler alert ) “Exalted Cyclops” C.P. Ellis ( Sam Rockwell ) tore up his KKK membership card and voted in favor of school integration. His act stunned his white-power brethren, as well as his adversaries—chief among them civil rights activist Ann Atwater ( Taraji P. Henson ), who served alongside Ellis as co-chair of a 10-day official community summit known as a “charrette” designed to reach a resolution on the integration issue. It was an honest-to-goodness come-to-Jesus moment for Ellis, and cemented a lifelong bond with Atwater, who spent the ensuing decades touring the country giving speeches with Ellis, and who eulogized the man at his 2015 funeral.
Veracity is certainly the best thing The Best of Enemies has going for it, since its action would seem wholly contrived were it not true. As it stands, it only seems partially contrived, thanks to the collection of cornball speeches, perfunctory montages and underlined soundtrack songs it employs to dramatize everything in dully standard terms. More troublesome than its formulaic corniness, however, is its fundamental focus, which should be evenly split between its two protagonists, and yet is heavily weighted in favor of Ellis. It’s a redemption saga in which the individual who guarantees school integration—thereby becoming a civil rights hero in the process—isn’t the woman who fought tooth-and-nail against evil white racists, but the reasonable KKK bigwig who finally found it within himself to grant African-Americans the rights they deserved.
This isn’t to claim that The Best of Enemies gets the particulars wrong; on the contrary, its primary plot points seem to approximate the historical record. Rather, it’s a question of storytelling emphasis—something not uncommon for a movie featuring Rockwell as a likable, and soon-to-see-the-light, racist. I’m referring, of course, to Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri , which netted Rockwell an Oscar. Like that film, Bissell’s work has the actor spew lots of ugly verbal venom while sanding his character’s roughest edges so he remains palatable, and capable of being redeemed in the eyes of both his compatriots and audience members. Though he’s the president of his KKK chapter, the worst Rockwell’s Ellis does is shoot up the house of a white woman who’s apparently dating a black man. And even then, he makes sure she’s upstairs before he and his cronies (including Wes Bentley) blast away at her first floor, thus ensuring no one gets hurt.
Otherwise, Ellis is presented as your average working-class family man, trying to provide for his KKK-disapproving wife (Anne Heche) and his kids, who just like Atwater’s daughters, aren’t getting a great education. That’s the primary means by which The Best of Enemies parallels the duo, although the film also makes sure to underline that they’re both poor and fiercely committed to their convictions (Atwater is known as “Roughhouse Annie”). Those details may be accurate, but they’re designed to equate the two—to put them on the same level—which is disingenuous at best, and bullshit at worst, since one of them is a virulent hatemonger and the other is a brave crusader.
The Best of Enemies aims to portray Ellis and Atwater as alike because that’s precisely what Ellis needs to learn through his contentious time participating in the charrette. And to be sure, there’s validity to the notion that tolerance is bred from people of different backgrounds conversing and commingling, whether in public or private. The problem is the lengths to which Bissell, who is white, goes to make one root for Ellis—which, however unavoidable that might be given the story at hand, winds up feeling wrong for a pro-civil rights film.
That’s most evident in a subplot about Ellis caring for an institutionalized Down syndrome-afflicted son. The Best of Enemies strives to garner sympathy via the sight of Ellis singing “Happy Birthday” to the developmentally disabled boy over a candlelit cake. The film then goes further by depicting a temporary crisis born from the kid’s panic over being forced to share his space with a strange new roommate whom he believes to be a monster. It’s a groan-worthy metaphorical scenario that speaks to Ellis’ own plight (later, Ellis even says that others think of him as a “monster”). Though Bissell somehow manages to botch this thread’s resolution in a thematically consistent and logical manner—ultimately, the solution turns out to be segregating the boy in his own quarters (?!?)—it nonetheless resounds as an egregiously manipulative device.
Rockwell underplays Ellis’ ugliness at every opportunity; he doesn’t come across as a cartoon, mercifully, but he also doesn’t resonate as a persuasive KKK leader either. Atwater, on the other hand, is relegated to second-fiddle status, which squanders Henson’s pleasurable scowl-heavy turn. The rest of the cast, including Babou Ceesay as charrette organizer Bill Riddick, and Bruce McGill as a villainous city council leader, hit their rote beats. Still, Bissell’s script grants them only one personality trait apiece and, like Atwater herself, they aren’t afforded any room to develop, or change.
Transformation, and consequently center stage, is reserved solely for Rockwell’s Ellis. After being forced to eat with Atwater, and chatting with a Vietnam Vet who hires African-Americans to run his hardware store, Ellis realizes the error of his ethos, and promptly does a dramatic about-face. His final moment of triumph pulls at the heartstrings, as do the ensuing end-credit clips of the real-life Ellis and Atwater talking about their enduring relationship. Yet in light of the fact that the preceding two hours have neutered Ellis of his truly rancid nature—the better to render him a civil rights emancipator in a white hood—such manufactured uplift leaves a sour taste in one’s mouth.

Can Airbnb Train Hosts Not to Be Racists?,www.thedailybeast.com,Jennifer Eberhardt,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/can-airbnb-train-hosts-not-to-be-racists,"EXCERPT Can Airbnb Train Hosts Not to Be Racists? A rigorous field experiment found that blacks were 16 percent less likely to be accepted as guests than whites. 04.08.19 4:41 AM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty
When you subscribe to Airbnb, you are welcomed “to a community that connects global travelers with local hosts across the world.” As an alternative to a hotel, Airbnb allows a less expensive and more intimate experience for travelers and a chance for hosts to make money by opening their homes to strangers. In essence, it’s a public marketplace for private accommodations. And its core mission is to open the world to people, to let users know that “every community is a place where you can belong.”
The idea for the company originated with Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, who met at the Rhode Island School of Design. They both wound up in San Francisco in 2007, worrying about how to pay the rent on the small apartment they shared. One weekend, they rented out space in their apartment to techies in town for a conference when the city’s hotels were booked, and a new idea was born. It took a while to turn that weekend success into a viable business model. But once they worked out the kinks, the company’s growth was astronomical. Today, Airbnb is used by over 150 million people in 81,000 cities across 200 countries. There are over 5 million homes to choose from—660,000 in the United States alone. By 2018, the once-struggling start-up was worth $31 billion.
Subscribers post a photograph and profile, scroll through home-like places that are available to rent, then book and pay for their lodging online. But unlike booking a room at a hotel, the travelers aren’t the only ones doing the choosing. The host can pass on a booking request. So savvy subscribers take pains to sell themselves, with photographs and chatty testimonials that portray them in the best light.
But even a stellar résumé wasn’t always enough to secure a booking. Over time, complaints began trickling in from minorities who felt they’d been discriminated against by hosts who declined to accept booking requests from them. By 2016, that trickle had turned into a tsunami as black users took to Twitter, Facebook, and other social media sites to share their stories. Their experiences requesting accommodations—whether in small-town Idaho or cosmopolitan Philadelphia—were remarkably similar: They’d tried to book a place and were told by the owner that it wasn’t available. Some had white friends try to book the same place for the same time period, and it suddenly became available. Some users even tried posing as white, changing their photograph and name, and, when they did, found that they could easily book places that were unavailable to them as black.
Researchers at Harvard Business School began digging into the problem and demonstrated how pervasive it was. A rigorous field experiment found that blacks were 16 percent less likely to be accepted as guests than whites, and no manner of adjusting variables beyond race could explain that.
The researchers developed guest profiles by systematically varying the name of the guest so that it sounded either stereotypically white or black. Using those profiles, they contacted the hosts of approximately 6,400 Airbnb listings across five American cities. Racial disparities in bookings were present in every city, with every type of property (whether high-end or low) and every category of host (whether they rented often or occasionally; whether they were offering a room or an entire home). It didn’t matter if the neighborhood was racially diverse. It didn’t even matter if the host was a from minority; black hosts discriminated against black people too.
When Airbnb launched its own in-depth investigation, their researchers found evidence that of all the people making booking requests on the platform, requests from blacks were the least likely to be accepted. The company clearly had a race problem. After a sluggish initial response, Airbnb, under the direction of Brian Chesky, began taking aggressive action to curb it. He identified racial discrimination as “the greatest challenge we face as a company... It cuts to the core of who we are and the values that we stand for.” “Some users even tried posing as white, changing their photograph and name, and, when they did, found that they could easily book places that were unavailable to them as black.”
Airbnb brought in Laura Murphy to help them address the challenge. Laura is an African-American civil rights attorney who has worked tirelessly to address racial inequality, including in the tourism industry. She spent three months meeting with dozens of stakeholder groups: employees, hosts, elected officials, regulatory agencies, tourism groups, civil rights organizations, and Airbnb users who’d been victims of discrimination.
As a lawyer, she first looked for a legal remedy. That meant figuring out how laws governing public accommodations might apply to this new hybrid situation. Hotels clearly could not deny someone a room based on race; current public accommodations laws forbid it. However, Airbnb is facilitating the advertisement of private accommodations—but on a public platform. How much control should people have in deciding who comes into their home once they have publicly advertised it to make money?
Laura suggested that Airbnb officials go beyond the federal legal requirement and determine for themselves what the rules of conduct should be on the site. She advised the company to strengthen its own nondiscrimination policy and require every user to sign a “community commitment” pact, spelled out in the sign-up process:
I agree to treat everyone in the Airbnb community— regardless of their race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, dis- ability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or age—with respect, and without judgment or bias... Discrimination prevents hosts, guests, and their families from feeling included and welcomed, and we have no tolerance for it.
Users who aren’t willing to sign the commitment can no longer use the platform. And those who violate the anti-discrimination promise can be banned by Airbnb. The commitment provides the company with leverage to uphold core values and dictates terms of use in a manner that is consistent with a traditional civil rights mission. Just as old problems can migrate to new spaces, old agendas can be adapted to support new solutions.
But while policy remedies are a start, getting people to adhere to Airbnb’s value statement will only go so far. Even people whose values are appropriately aligned can fail to act in accordance with those values in ambiguous situations. They may not even be aware that they’re breaking the rules in those cases. After all, there are non-racial ways to explain away the rejection of a black applicant: They have young kids, and my home has too many breakable items. They’re on spring break, and I don’t want people partying all week long. It’s easy to tell yourself that you don’t see color, come up with a host of other justifications, and relieve yourself of any self-recrimination for your bias. Laura’s job was to focus the company’s managers on how these psychological maneuvers worked subconsciously.
The primary problem is not that “people on the platform say, ‘Look, I don’t want any African Americans,’” Laura said. “The biggest problem to me is the unconscious bias.” And it’s more difficult to police and remedy that than it is to root out blatant bigotry.
Given that the natural inclination in the tech industry is to remove friction, Airbnb moved toward solutions with this principle in mind. They decided to encourage people to use their “instant book” option, where listings could be arranged without the prior approval of the host. This option is similar to the process that hotels use in the public accommodations arena: if the space is available and the guest can pay, a room is booked without a need for a guest photograph, a profile, or any discussions about hobbies or the reason for their visit. And indeed, Airbnb’s analysis showed that when “instant book” was used, racial differences in guest acceptance rates evaporated.
But those results didn’t exactly warrant celebration. It turns out that only a tiny fraction of travelers—about 3 percent—opted for the “instant book” process. And blacks were more reluctant to use the option than other groups—perhaps because they wanted to avoid any ugly encounters that might arise from their hosts’ surprise. If discrimination has become the expectation—lurking in the shadows of every encounter—then it might be better for the host to know their race ahead of time. So an option designed to disguise race in pursuit of equality also came to signal just how deep the fear of rejection runs.
Another alternative was to add more friction rather than take it away. When hosts are provided with the previous reviews of guests by other hosts, for example, they are more likely to accept them into their homes, and the racial differences in acceptance rate begin to disappear. That’s likely because the practice allows hosts to replace vague racial stereotypes of how those guests might behave in their homes with concrete, relevant, factual information about how they have previously behaved. Indeed, decades of research on stereotyping highlight the power of individuating information to mitigate bias. “The biggest problem to me is the unconscious bias.” — Laura Murphy, civil rights attorney, Airbnb
It’s too early in the process to tell whether these tweaks will be enough to wipe out the kind of overt discrimination that prompted complaints. But the company has created a team of engineers, researchers, data scientists, and designers whose sole purpose is to root out bias. They’ve also begun to route complaints of discrimination to investigative specialists and created an Open Doors program that promises to find a comfortable place to stay for anyone who is not able to book a listing because of discrimination.
Laura Murphy is gratified by the changes because she understands “the pain that race discrimination on that platform caused.” She knows the stakes are high. And while the platform and the tactics may be new, the problem is as old as America.
She grew up in Baltimore in the 1960s, the daughter of political activists who enlisted their children in civil rights campaigns. Yet her parents feared traveling the country without their Negro Motorist Green Book , a legendary travel guide that mapped out safe places for black travelers in almost every state, in an era when businesses—hotels, restaurants, taverns, gas stations, auto repair shops—barred their entry. The Green Book promised to provide the information blacks needed to “travel without embarrassment.”
In some respects, the Green Book served as a mid-20th century version of Airbnb for blacks who were shut out of conventional commercial lodging. It was a cultural response to a structural problem. Yet the problem of the 21st century involves managing integration, not segregation. Now that the laws have changed and spaces are being transformed, how do we all find, accommodate, and see one another?"

To ancient Greeks, Sparta was synonymous with military might.
To today’s transgender soldiers, SPART*A is a source of strength.
SPART*A, which stands for Service Members, Partners, Allies, for Respect and Tolerance For All, is an advocacy group founded in 2013 that supports transgender people in the military. A mere eight people sit on its board. The staffers, all volunteer, sometimes have to take personal leave time from their day jobs for meetings.
But as the implementation of the transgender troop ban approaches on April 12, SPART*A has proved itself to be as mighty as it is tiny.
It would not be an overstatement to say that it will probably save lives.
Once the Trump administration’s policy goes into effect next month, any transgender service member who has not yet come out and received a gender dysphoria diagnosis will have to hide or suppress their gender identity if they don’t want to risk discharge.
As mental health experts previously told The Daily Beast, transgender service members working under such conditions could suffer from increased depression and anxiety.
That’s precisely why they will need SPART*A’s confidential online discussion group.
“SPART*A will fill a small part of the void by providing affirming peer support to those transgender service members being denied the opportunity to receive medically necessary care,” Lieutenant Commander Blake Dremann, an active-duty member of the Navy who serves as president of SPART*A, told The Daily Beast.
One of those service members is a closeted transgender woman—currently a lieutenant colonel pilot in the Air Force approaching retirement—who agreed to speak with The Daily Beast on condition of anonymity because she could risk discharge if named.
Before this Air Force pilot found the SPART*A discussion group earlier this year, she felt alone. She had come to the realization that she needed to transition years ago, after suppressing her gender identity while she and her wife raised their children together.
“Finally,” she told The Daily Beast, “I got to the point where I just decided there’s no use fighting it anymore.”
But when the Obama administration announced in 2016 that transgender military service would be permitted, she still wasn’t ready to transition because she worried that doing so would break up her family.
That fear was warranted. After telling her wife that she needed to transition, as the pilot told The Daily Beast, the couple “kind of got to a point where we were considering divorce and weren’t sure what we were going to do.”
Then came President Trump’s July 2017 Twitter thread announcing that he intended to put an end to transgender military service .
“The infamous tweet came out,” said the pilot, “and so at that point I was potentially glad I didn’t [come out earlier.]”
Marriage counseling has helped the pilot and her wife turn a corner over the last six months. But at the same time, of course, the Trump administration has been in court, fighting to implement the transgender troop ban as quickly as possible. In January, the Supreme Court decided to allow the ban to go into effect.
The pilot has felt distraught and isolated.
“My wife knew [I was transgender], but there wasn’t really anyone I could talk to and I didn’t know any people who were trans,” she told The Daily Beast.
Then she happened upon SPART*A through a chance connection. Her electrologist—a hair removal specialist—connected her with a nearby transgender service member, who in turn introduced her to SPART*A’s closed online forum. What the pilot found there was “amazing,” she told The Daily Beast, and “opened up a whole world of resources.”
“All of a sudden, I went from not having anyone to talk to—and no one that I felt safe sharing things with—to having this resource of all these people,” she said.
SPART*A branched off from the LGBT military organization OutServe-SLDN in 2013, Dremann told The Daily Beast, and became more focused on transgender issues over the following two years, pushing for open service while supporting its handful of members.
The peer support function of SPART*A, said Dremann, “has been our main focus since the beginning, since even when we were officially under OutServe.”
The discussion group was created as a “place for people to be able to go whether there were others that were like them, no matter where in the world,” as Dremann noted. It functions in part as an educational forum where transgender service members can stay on top of policy changes. But it is also a social space, says Dremann, where transgender troops can “make friends”—where they can “socialize” and “vent their frustrations or celebrate their victories as they work through their transition.”
For the anonymous Air Force pilot, the group has provided both information and support.
Although several transgender service members are currently scrambling to get a gender dysphoria diagnosis before the April 12 deadline so that they can be protected under the troop ban’s grandfather clause, the pilot doesn’t want to get a diagnosis, even though she needs one.
“I definitely think that had I wanted to or had I decided to, I could have,” she said.
But through the private SPART*A group she learned about a little-known Air Force regulation that would bar her from flying if she received a gender dysphoria diagnosis. “That career field provides me the stability and the money I need to be able to take care of myself and transition—and to take care of my family, which is a high priority”
With retirement approaching, the pilot can’t afford to be grounded. Because she plans to pursue a career in commercial aviation after leaving the armed forces, she feels pressure to keep flying until the end to make her résumé more appealing to airliners.
“Continuing to fly until I retire will significantly increase the chance of getting hired,” she said. “That career field provides me the stability and the money I need to be able to take care of myself and transition—and to take care of my family, which is a high priority.”
The pilot had “absolutely no idea” that this regulation even existed until she connected with SPART*A—and asking Air Force medical staff about it would have been unwise.
“It’s not like I can just go to the [Air Force] flight surgeon and say, ‘Hey, by the way, if a friend of mine who’s a pilot had gender dysphoria would there be any issues with that?’” she explained, with a laugh. “You can’t really ask that question without outing yourself.”
Delaying transition to ensure that she can support her family won’t be easy for the pilot. She will have to deal with months of gender dysphoria, compounded by the distress of being unable to receive transition-related medical care. It’s only because retirement is so close that she can even consider putting off the process.
“Feeling the way I feel, there’s no way that I would go 20 years not being able to transition if I were to start over again today and was at the point I am,” she said.
The pilot is honest about the emotional toll that the policy takes.
“Do I like it? Absolutely not,” she said. “Does it impact my work? I would say yes.”
The pilot isn’t affected “to the point of being dangerous or anything like that,” she clarified, but she readily admits that she can’t exactly bring enthusiasm to certain aspects of her job while being denied medically-necessary health care .
“I’m maybe not quite as effective if I’m writing reports or doing some of the administrative stuff as quick as I could be,” she said. “I get a little bit distracted.”
The consequences of being unable to transition aren’t limited to her workplace, either.
“At home as well, it definitely takes a toll there, because when I’m focusing on transitioning and thinking about that, that’s time that’s taken away from being with my family,” she said. “So I definitely see that it’s affecting my quality of life.”
The support provided by the SPART*A group is no substitute for gender transition. Major medical associations agree that hormone therapy and surgeries are often not optional for transgender people who suffer from gender dysphoria. But SPART*A can help blunt some of the pain while the pilot endures the needless waiting.
“For the long-term success of my transition and for the good of our family, this is kind of what we’ve been relegated to go through,” she said. “Even though there’s really no reason why I shouldn’t be able to start on hormones right now and make that transition.”
Recently, the pilot was able to spend an entire weekend away from work presenting female—and she posted about it on SPART*A to cheers from her peers.
“Everyone is just super supportive of each other and encouraging along the way,” she said. “It’s a safe space where you can be happy about the little victories.”
Maintaining the safety of the SPART*A group is a tough assignment.
The first rule of the SPART*A group is that no one discusses details outside the group.
“We have very strict code of conduct rules that we follow to make sure that interactions and conversations with people in the group remain there,” said Dremann.
With the threat of the transgender troop ban looming large, it’s also important to ensure that no bad actors infiltrate the private group, which is why SPART*A has instituted a strict vetting process in which individual chapter leaders must vouch for applicants.
As the April 12 deadline approaches, Dremann reports, the group has seen “an uptick in numbers”—especially after Dremann and four other transgender service members testified before Congress in February . He estimates that over 100 members have joined in the last year, with about 40 of those members joining “in the last couple weeks.” Before that, the group primarily accrued new members through word of mouth.
“So our vetting process has had to be a little bit more robust just because we don’t have anybody who knows some of the folks who were referred to us,” he told The Daily Beast.
For many transgender service members, SPART*A’s discussion group is the only place where they can comfortably seek peer support. Even though there are many transgender support websites and online discussion groups, “a lot of them are also public,” as the pilot explained, “so for a lot of us in the military that doesn’t really work.” “I didn’t know anyone who was transgender and I didn’t know how to track people down because by going out on social media and saying, ‘Hey, are there any other transgender people around? Do you want to hang out?’—then you’re outing yourself”
Before her electrologist happened to introduce her to another transgender service member, for example, the pilot had no idea how to meet others in her community without jeopardizing her career.
“I didn’t know anyone who was transgender and I didn’t know how to track people down because by going out on social media and saying, ‘Hey, are there any other transgender people around? Do you want to hang out?’—then you’re outing yourself,” she said.
Although SPART*A’s peer support group resembles other transgender discussion forums in some key ways, says Dremann, its specific focus makes it irreplaceable.
“The military is a different beast with different struggles and different ways of working through transition,” he said. “Our transition process within the military is very linear and very strict.”
With rules and regulations come confusion—and panicked queries from new members.
“On SPART*A, as the new people come on and they’re asking questions, it’s fantastic how people are always willing to jump in and share their experiences,” the pilot said.
For the Air Force pilot, who by now is a seasoned veteran of the group, SPART*A will continue to function as a “support lifeline,” as she told The Daily Beast.
“I regret that it took me until this long in my life, at the very end [of my career], to be able to find it, But I definitely consider it a blessing that just through happenstance and chance I was able to find my way into it.”
Through the group, she has already connected with transgender flight attendants and pilots in the civilian aerospace industry who will become her new support network when she retires. As a commercial airline pilot, she will be allowed to get a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and transition without losing her job. “It’s just a shame that a policy is going to come in for a short time that can totally wreck people’s lives that we pretty much all know is going to be reversed hopefully not too far down the road”
Although her own happy future is drawing closer, the pilot sympathizes with those younger transgender service members who will have to serve under the ban until it is rescinded, which she believes will happen as soon as the Trump administration ends.
“It’s just a shame that a policy is going to come in for a short time that can totally wreck people’s lives that we pretty much all know is going to be reversed hopefully not too far down the road,” she said.
Dremann, too, is confident the ban will be short-lived: “Oh, we’ll get it changed back.”
In the meantime, SPART*A will be there, providing a lot of support with limited resources.
“We are definitely punching above our weight,” said Dremann. “We’ve got a bunch of active-duty service members trying to move big rocks. But that’s what makes us resilient.”"
Kirstjen Nielsen’s Ouster Strengthens Stephen Miller’s Grip on Trump’s Immigration Policy,www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kirstjen-nielsens-ouster-strengthens-stephen-millers-grip-on-president-trumps-immigration-policy,"SURVIVOR Kirstjen Nielsen’s Ouster Strengthens Stephen Miller’s Grip on President Trump’s Immigration Policy Stephen Miller had long thought Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen wasn’t up to the job. On Sunday night, he got his wish. 04.08.19 2:55 PM ET Photo Illustration by Kelly Caminero/The Daily Beast/Getty
Over the past year and a half, President Trump’s policy adviser and speechwriter Stephen Miller and Kirstjen Nielsen , the now ousted homeland security secretary, were locked in a bitter cold war of backbiting and paranoia.
By Sunday night, it was clear who had won.
Trump’s decision to dismiss Nielsen signaled not only that Miller had emerged victorious but also further solidified him as the premier anti-immigration hardliner and survivor in an administration notorious for prolific, rapid turnover at the highest levels.
Before everything came to a head early this week, the president had walked up to the line of sacking Nielsen several times, sometimes cooling off but inevitably getting re-energized by his own resentments, cable-news coverage of the border, and aides and advisers who re-enforced his instincts. Nielsen’s job was temporarily saved last year in part by her willingness to publicly and vociferously defend Trump’s controversial actions, such as deploying U.S. troops to the border late last year.
This was around the same time that Trump had told Fox News that he wanted Nielsen “to be much tougher on the border,” and suggested personnel changes were on the horizon.
But in recent weeks, the president asked Nielsen to bar all migrants, including those legally seeking asylum, from crossing into the United States via the southern border. When Nielsen reminded Trump that doing so would violate federal law, her reasoning only spiked the president’s rage further, according to The New York Times .
A senior White House official characterized this latest disagreement to The Daily Beast as a “last straw.”
By the weekend, the situation had reached a point where virtually all power centers in Trumpworld, in and out of the White House, had decided to elevate Nielsen as the scapegoat for internal frustrations regarding the influx of asylum seekers and continued attempts by migrants to cross into the U.S. without legal authorization.
Among many former Trump administration officials, her departure is a welcome shake-up. During most of her time in the administration, Nielsen and Miller were at odds. In fact, their working relationship became so tense that the two could barely be in the same room without making other top officials uncomfortable, two knowledgeable sources told The Daily Beast.
“Miller thought Nielsen was a soft-on-the-border Bushy, and she thought he was an egomaniacal lunatic who hated brown people. Needless to say, that made for awkward moments in the Oval [Office] and Cabinet Room,” said a former senior Trump administration official who has been in the room with both numerous times. The ex-official also described their professional relationship as one of clear “mutual disgust.” “Miller thought Nielsen was a soft-on-the-border Bushy and she thought he was an egomaniacal lunatic who hated brown people.” — A former senior Trump administration official
A current administration official confirmed that Nielsen had a vanishingly low opinion of Miller and openly wondered if Trump’s senior policy adviser had often leaked against her to the press, or if he trash-talked her behind her back to the president.
Her instincts were right on the latter concern, as Miller made no secret of his feelings about Nielsen to Trump, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations.
Since the dawn of the Trump era, Miller has been a skilled but generally quiet knife fighter and operator behind the scenes, outlasting or outmaneuvering other senior officials, keeping on the president’s good side, and, as a result, expanding his reach of influence.
By mid-2017, Miller had elbowed his way deep into national security and foreign affairs deliberations , and used his clout to advocate dropping the cap on refugee admissions last year to a record low.
In an interview with The Washington Post , Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-IA) said he was “very, very concerned” about the rapid-fire dismissals within the Department of Homeland Security and those who are rumored to be next on the chopping block. Grassley also took a jab at Miller, saying it would be “hard for him to demonstrate he’s accomplished anything for the president.”
“It’s pretty hard to elaborate on it when there hasn’t been any accomplishments,” Grassley added.
Those who know and have worked with Miller say he is shrewd in not infuriating Trump, knowing that too much of the limelight in Trumpworld can be fatal. He watched with a careful eye as Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist, rose within Trump’s ranks only to be sidelined after “President Bannon” storylines hyped his power and sway over the presidency.
Sensing Bannon’s demise was near, Miller turned on his former ally and trashed him to Trump, hastening Bannon’s exit from the West Wing.
With Nielsen, there’s even less love lost. But the internal antipathy aimed at Nielsen certainly didn’t end with Miller and the president. The sources noted how other senior aides, including Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, didn’t have Nielsen’s back, either.
She had also run afoul of one of Trump’s principal outside counselors, Fox Business host and immigration hardliner Lou Dobbs, who had repeatedly counseled Trump to ditch Nielsen in recent months, according to a person with knowledge of their private discussions.
Late last month, the Fox Business star dedicated part of his show to calling for the riddance of the “flailing” and “overwhelmed” DHS secretary.
It was the same mix of public and private pressure Dobbs used to urge Trump to can Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general who the president routinely denigrated as a failure, personally annoying, and mentally “retarded. ”
A Fox Business spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on this story. DHS and White House spokespeople didn’t immediately respond, either. But as The Daily Beast previously reported , Trump values Dobbs so much as a confidant and adviser that he has even had the TV host patched in on speakerphone during high-level Oval Office meetings.
Trump himself had on-and-off flirted with axing Nielsen, who he would often denounce as an ineffective softie on immigration and the southern border, despite Nielsen becoming a public face for Trump’s catastrophic family-separation policy, and her own fervent defenses of the administration’s more draconian measures. The president would make annoyed, screaming phone calls to Nielsen to thrash her for her perceived weakness, and he didn’t hesitate to berate her in front of colleagues during senior-level meetings, either. “She’s probably partially relieved and partially extremely frustrated. She was made a scapegoat, I think. She tried to do everything they wanted, but you cannot legally do everything they want.” — A DHS official
“She’s probably partially relieved and partially extremely frustrated. She was made a scapegoat, I think. She tried to do everything they wanted, but you cannot legally do everything they want,” a DHS official told The Daily Beast. “To fix the issues that need to be fixed, you have to be able to come to a good-faith partnership with people across the aisle and put your heads together to actually work with Congress, and that’s completely impossible in this environment.”
Now that she’s out of a job, Nielsen reportedly has zero illusions about her diminished career prospects. During her time on Team Trump, she became a particular target, including for public confrontation, for liberal and left-wing activists who were determined to offer her no quarter for her prominent role in Trump’s family separations. In a letter this month signed by multiple advocacy organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and Moms Rising, the groups implored Fortune 500 companies to blacklist Trump administration officials including Miller, Nielsen, and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
“We call on you to make it clear that you will not hire for employment, contract for consulting, or seat on your boards, anyone involved in the development or implementation of the Trump administration’s family separation immigration policy,” the letter reads .
Speaking to reporters outside her home on Monday, Nielsen said she thanks Trump for the “tremendous opportunity to serve the country,” and that the two have a common goal in cracking down on the U.S.-Mexico border. Still, as she plots her next move, Nielsen should expect little, if any, support from her former boss.
“Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service,” Trump had posted to Twitter on Sunday. A White House official told The Daily Beast that the president and White House’s lukewarm goodbye to her was fully “intentional.”

A New York couple has mysteriously vanished during a Caribbean vacation, with family members saying they've not heard from them in nearly two weeks. Orlando Moore and Portia Ravenelle set off on vacation to the Dominican Republic at the end of last month and were supposed to return home 11 days ago. Police say the couple checked out of their hotel in the town of Samana but haven't been seen since, and their car is still sitting in a parking lot at Newark airport. “He was supposed to return Wednesday morning, the 27th of March,” said Lashay Turner, Moore’s sister. “We haven’t seen him return so we started to call authorities.” The last picture of the couple posted to social media before they disappeared shows them riding horses. The families have reportedly been told they didn't make their flight home. There is also no sign of a car they rented on the Dominican Republic. “When these things happen, you always think of the worst, but we are hoping for the best,” said Edith Walters, Moore's grandmother.

NYC Threatens to Close Yeshivas That Don’t Ban Unvaccinated Kids,www.thedailybeast.com,Tracy.Connor@thedailybeast.com (Tracy Connor),04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/measles-crisis-nyc-threatens-to-close-yeshivas-that-dont-ban-unvaccinated-kids,"LAST CHANCE NYC Threatens to Close Yeshivas That Don’t Ban Unvaccinated Kids The city Health Department has expanded an order and threatened sanctions for Jewish schools that don’t comply. 04.08.19 6:45 PM ET Mareen Fischinger, Photographer
New York City health officials announced a new crackdown Monday on yeshivas in a Brooklyn neighborhood that are letting unvaccinated students attend school in the midst of a major measles crisis.
The Health Department had already ordered Jewish academies in certain zip codes to send home children who are not fully immunized, but some of the schools flouted the rules.
Now, the agency has extended the ban to all yeshivas in the Williamsburg neighborhood, warning that those who don’t could be “subject to fines or possible school closure.”
Since the city outbreak began in October, 285 people—most of them children—have contracted the highly contagious but preventable virus. Forty of the cases were from a single yeshiva that did not comply with city orders, say officials.
Twenty-one patients had to be hospitalized—contradicting the anti-vaxxer argument that measles is not a serious disease.
Officials have said vaccination rates in some Orthodox Jewish communities are lower due to religious exemptions from the shots—even though many religious leaders are urging their followers to get inoculated.
The outbreak in Brooklyn is the largest—but there is also a large outbreak in the Jewish community in Rockland County , New York, where a judge recently struck down an order banning unvaccinated kids from all public places. In addition, Michigan health authorities are trying to stem an outbreak in Oakland County , another Orthodox community, where the number of cases hit 41 this week.
Another outbreak in Washington State, centered in the Slavic community, stands at 74 cases with no new infections reported in several weeks.
Some of the outbreaks have been sparked by travel to and from Israel, where the disease has spread to thousands of people .
But health officials say a growing anti-vaxxer movement, fueled by debunked conspiracy theories, is also to blame for the comeback of a disease that was essentially eradicated in 2002.
The virus can live in the air for two hours after a single sneeze or cough, making it easy to spread in communities with lower vaccination rates or to babies who have not yet gotten the MMR shot.
New York health officials are particularly concerned that the Brooklyn outbreak is continuing to grow as Passover approaches and families plan gatherings. READ THIS LIST"
Scouted: A Runner’s Guide to Running Shoes: Road Vs. Trail and Everything In Between,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.grudo@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Grudo),04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/guide-to-running-shoes-road-trail-and-hybrid-shoes-from-asics-adidas-and-salomon,"Scouted By The Beast
From the highest bird’s eye I can think of, there are three types of running shoes that cover most of anyone’s needs. Generally speaking to their extremes… The sturdier trail running shoe gives you support and structure The flexible hybrid shoe gives you a mix of the two and leans toward
Away from the lists of their features and closer to the real world, each shoe type sits somewhere on a spectrum that really best adheres to your style, your feet , and your goals. Some trail running shoes work best on city streets while some road runners will find solace in trail running shoes (especially when navigating broken sidewalks). Personally, I’ve always relied on the heavier and sturdier shoes both because I’m heavier and less-sturdy than I’d like to be and because I split my time between running on roads and paths and lifting weights at the gym. Those sessions mean I’m pushing down hard with my weight — and the weight of whatever I’m lifting — down on the sole of my shoes, wearing them down faster than normal.
Like I’ve already shared , I’ve had a great experience with the ASICS Gel-Venture 6 , which dances on the line between the trail and the road in terms of the support it provides against the lightness it allows. And after ASICS sent me a pair of its new GEL-Nimbus 21 shoes, I found more of the same. They corrected my form, cushioned my impact, and felt very comfortable. Designed with a litany of features — from nanofibers that cushion and bounce back rapidly to a lightweight and responsive midsole — the shoes remain light enough to help me bounce down the road and achieve my cardio goals.
You know best what shoes feel right, both when you first slip it on and when you run around with it a bit, but it’s smart to approach your search with a slight filter on what you’re looking for. Here are some of the best selling and top-rated pairs of shoes in each category so you know how to align your search.
Road Running Shoes | adidas Running UltraBOOST: The UltraBOOSTs feel light just by the looks of them — which says a lot about the design road running shoes aim for. Knit and adaptive upper wraps keep your feet snug in these but let you rotate and pivot as you need to navigate the road. The heel is structured so that you can get a natural fit that envelops your heel but again allows you to hinge on it as you please. The cushioning and insole will both err on the lighter end but adidas aimed to give you as much as support as it could without overbearing the weight.
Trail Running Shoes | Salomon Speedcross 4: The Salomons are water resistant and fit your feet snugly and securely for the tricky terrain of the trail. You can keep laces out of the way with special pockets to tuck them into and the midsole is designed for additional and long-lasting cushioning. The lug pattern on the shoe’s bottoms enhances your traction even when wet. Finally, these shoes are really very attractive and will shine during a hike or run or walk around your glamping site — no judgment here.
Hybrid Shoes | ASICS GEL-Quantum 360 Knit: The Quantums offer a lot of cushion in a knit design, combining the lightweight ideal of the road and the supportive ideal of the trail. The lack of seams in the forefoot aim to ensure less irritation on your feet and the tongue and collar of the shoe is padded for additional support. The mesh top stretches in multiple direction to reinforce its grip and concurrently allow you to move freely. This shoe is a bit more serious, a bit more loose, and a bit more specialized for the runner who wants to live as close to the trail/road middle as possible.

The Moment Kirstjen Nielsen Doomed Her Future With Trump,www.thedailybeast.com,Ruben Navarrette Jr.,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-moment-kirstjen-nielsen-doomed-her-future-with-trump,"SYCOPHANTS PREFERRED The Moment Kirstjen Nielsen Doomed Her Future With Trump The split was never about toughness, but about what can and what can’t be done to stop something as old as human civilization: the movement of people across borders. opinion Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photos by Getty
San Diego – Kirstjen Nielsen and Donald Trump were a bad fit from the start.The only question was who was going to leave whom.
The story released for public consumption is that, following a White House meeting with Trump on Sunday, Nielsen decided to resign. By all accounts, however, she wasn’t ready to call it quits. She was fired as head of the gargantuan Department of Homeland Security, which employs a staggering 240,000 people.
Late Sunday, Nielsen tweeted that she would stay on until Wednesday to help with the transition – and, no doubt, attempt to save a smidgen of face. On Monday, she met briefly with a gaggle of reporters outside her home in Alexandria, Virginia. Before brushing them off and hustling back inside, Nielsen insisted that she and Trump still had the same goal: stronger border security.
That doesn’t mean anything. Trump and Nielsen had radically different opinions of what the U.S. government – and specifically, DHS – could do to secure the border to the point where people don’t cross it without an invitation.
The media never understood the relationship between Trump and Nielsen. When it wasn’t portraying her as loyal to a fault in carrying out Trump’s policy of separating immigrant families, it was playing up the friction between the two and attributing it to the assumption that Nielsen – who seems plenty tough to most of us — wasn’t tough enough for Trump’s taste.
That’s wrong. The split between the two was never about toughness, but about what can and what can’t be done to stop something that has been occurring for as long as human civilization: the movement of people across borders in search of something better.
You can build a moat, a wall, or a blockade, but human nature doesn’t succumb to physical barriers.
For years, scores of Border Patrol agents have told me – on my own trips to the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas, Arizona and California – that there is no wall high enough, deep enough, or long enough to stop someone who has to feed his or her family. The experts understand this fact.
The split between Trump and Nielsen was about the difference between politicians who win over voters by promising the impossible, and the Cabinet officials who have the misfortune of being tasked with making the impossible happen.
In her public comments over the last few months, Nielsen dropped hints that – even if she wanted to shut off all illegal immigration -- her hands were tied by the law and the Constitution, as well as by what Congress had already authorized, and could be expected to authorize going forward.
But, in truth, Nielsen was also limited by something bigger. She was constrained by her attempt to do her job in a way that was – to use words that probably seem foreign to anti-immigrant crusader and White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller, who reportedly had a hand in her firing – honest, practical, and realistic.
We still don’t know the specifics of exactly what occurred at Nielsen’s meeting with Trump. Did the president call her to the White House with the intention of making good on his threat to fire her, which he has been toying with since last Spring when John Kelly, then-White House Chief of Staff, reportedly intervened to save the job of his protégé? Or did matters come to a head at the meeting, over the question of whether DHS can actually stop illegal immigration?
What we know is that Nielsen’s dismissal came just a few days after she accompanied Trump on a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border to talk about immigration – a visit that, in hindsight, might have been designed to show the world how little Trump understands about either the border or immigration. Trump – who used the visit to hang a No Vacancy sign and announce that “the country is full”— seems to really believe that it’s possible to “shut down” a 2,000-mile border and stop illegal immigrants from entering the United States.
Consider what happened when Trump — during a recent White House meeting — ordered Nielsen to close down the very busy port of El Paso and to do it the very next day. Nielsen was the voice of sanity. According to CNN , she told Trump that would be a bad and even dangerous idea.
According to two people in the room, Trump said: ""I don't care.""
Who thinks this way? I’ll tell you who. People who don’t live near the border and who only visit now and then for a few hours at a time. Also, people who don’t work for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol or DHS, which oversees them both. In other words, the further you are from the problem, the more likely you are to think you have the solution.
Which brings me to how Trump and Nielsen got off to such a bad start in the first place, and why the relationship was always doomed to fail.
I’m tempted to say that trouble began in December 2017, during Nielsen’s confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. At one point, the nominee was asked if she agreed with the statement that DHS was “not going to build a wall from sea to shining sea” along the U.S.-Mexico border. She responded with a simple, one-word answer: ""yes.""
That response could not have set well with Trump who, in courting his supporters, oversold the idea of a “big, beautiful” border wall, 12 to 15 feet high and 2,000 miles long – and one that Mexico was going to pay for no less.
But, it’s more accurate to say that the seeds of what would grow into this dysfunctional relationship were planted a year earlier, way back in December 2016 when Trump chose Kelly – a retired Marine general – to head DHS. Nielsen was his deputy. No Kelly, no Nielsen.
It was Kelly who made the statement Nielsen agreed to at her confirmation, about how DHS was “not going to build a wall from sea to shining sea” on the U.S.-Mexico border. Now, to be fair, Kelly also told the senators that he agreed that “physical barriers work” in combating illegal activity, but he emphasized that these barriers should be placed strategically where they will do the most good.
An answer like that makes sense. It’s honest, practical, and realistic. Which explains why Trump, and Miller, wanted nothing to do with it. They prefer an immigration policy that is simplistic, showy, and demagogic.
All of this helps makes clear what sort of candidate should toss their hat into the ring to replace Nielsen. Sycophants preferred. No grownups need apply. Grasp of reality, optional. READ THIS LIST"

‘I Am Ashamed’: Felicity Huffman to Plead Guilty in College Admissions Scandal,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/felicity-huffman-to-plead-guilty-in-college-admissions-scam-i-am-ashamed,"‘DEEP REGRET’ ‘I Am Ashamed’: Felicity Huffman to Plead Guilty in College Admissions Scandal Huffman was among 13 parents to agree to plead guilty on Monday. Fellow star actress Lori Loughlin is not one of them. 04.08.19 3:21 PM ET Brian Snyder/Reuters
Actress Felicity Huffman and a dozen other parents involved in the massive college admissions cheating scandal will plead guilty to bribery and fraud, authorities announced Monday.
The 13 parents are among nearly 50 people charged last month in the scheme authorities have called the “largest college admissions scam prosecuted by the Justice Department.”
Prosecutors alleged these parents paid admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer, 58, more than $25 million total to rig test scores, cheat on SAT exams, and bribe college coaches, all with the goal of getting their children into elite universities, including the University of Southern California, Georgetown, Stanford, and Yale. Singer pleaded guilty in Boston court last month to charges including racketeering, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice.
The scheme occurred unbeknownst to many of the parents’ children and sent shock waves through the higher-education world.
“I am in full acceptance of my guilt and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions,” Huffman said in a Monday statement . “I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community.I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college.”
Huffman, a 56-year-old Emmy Award-winning actress, “agreed to pay Singer at least $15,000 to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme for her oldest daughter,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said Monday.
The payment—which was made out to Key Worldwide Foundation, a non-profit organization run by Singer—ultimately enabled the actress’ daughter to end up with a SAT score of 1420, a 400-point bump from her previous score. Huffman's husband, fellow Emmy-winning actor William H. Macy, was not named in the complaint. She will plead guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.
“My daughter knew absolutely nothing about my actions, and in my misguided and profoundly wrong way I have betrayed her,” Huffman said on Monday , less than a week after she appeared in Boston federal court. “This transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life. My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty.”
According to Huffman’s plea agreement , prosecutors will seek a four to 10-month prison sentence. Her defense is pushing for a maximum sentence of six months.
Top lawyer Gordon Caplan , who allegedly paid $75,000 to fake his daughter’s learning disability to help her get a better score on a college entrance exam, was also named among the parents who plan to plead guilty.
“I take full and sole responsibility for my conduct and I am deeply ashamed of my behavior and my actions,” the former lawyer said in a Friday statement obtained by The Daily Beast. “I apologize not only to my family, friends, colleagues, and the legal Bar, but also to students everywhere who have been accepted to college through their own hard work.”
In addition to the TV star and dozen other parents who are prepared to plead guilty, the U.S. Attorney’s Office on Monday announced charges against two additional parents: Bruce and Davina Isackson.
The California couple “have both agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud,” after allegedly paying $600,000 in Facebook stock to get one daughter into UCLA and another into USC, the affidavit states.
“Thanks for the follow up call regarding the attacked Key Worldwide Foundation involve. Per our discussion can you please send me an email confirming that if [our daughter] is not admitted to UCLA as a freshman for the Fall 2016 class that The Key Worldwide Foundation will refund our $250,000 gift,” Bruce e-mailed Singer on July 11, 2016, according to the affidavit . “Again, both Davina and I are greatly appreciative of all your efforts on [our daughter]’s behalf!”
The 61-year-old father, who also allegedly conspired with Singer to get his younger daughter into USC as a rowing recruit, will also plead guilty to money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the IRS. His daughter, who was not named in the affidavit, was not competitive in rowing, “but instead an avid equestrian.”
“No words can express how profoundly sorry we are for what we have done,” the Isacksons said in a statement obtained by The Daily Beast on Monday. “Our duty as parents was to set a good example for our children and instead we have harmed and embarrassed them by our misguided decisions. We have also let down our family, friends, colleagues and our entire community. We have worked cooperatively with the prosecutors and will continue to do so as we take full responsibility for our bad judgment.”"
YouTube Prank Star Arrested for Impersonating Cop to Ticket a Mom,www.thedailybeast.com,kelly.weill@thedailybeast.com (Kelly Weill),04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtube-star-charles-ross-arrested-for-impersonating-cop,"PAUSED YouTube Prank Star Arrested for Impersonating Cop to Ticket a Mom Charles Ross has annoyed his hometown to no end with years of stunts to gain millions of followers. He finally may have gone too far. 04.08.19 2:23 PM ET via Youtube
If being a nuisance were a crime, Charles Ross would be a serial offender. Instead, Ross, who goes by “RossCreations” on YouTube, is facing the latest in a series of charges he racked up while filming “prank” videos.
Ross, 25, has more than 2 million followers across his two channels, RossCreations and Vlog Creations. There he uploads prank videos ranging from the innocuous (trying to sell lemonade on the highway) to those that verge on assault ( giving strangers wedgies or unexpectedly kissing them). But YouTube’s prank scene is competitive, with creators pulling more outlandish stunts in a bid for coveted clicks. And police weren’t laughing when Ross allegedly impersonated an officer and pretended to write a ticket for a woman walking with her two young children.
On April Fool’s Day, the Sarasota, Florida Youtuber allegedly dressed as a police officer and approached a woman who was carrying her two children from the parking lot of a local restaurant.
According to a police affidavit, Ross threatened to write the woman a parking ticket. When the woman realized her car was legally parked, she allegedly questioned his credentials and feared for her safety, she told police. The woman said Ross became verbally aggressive with her. When she threatened to call the real police, Ross drove off. (People threaten to call police on Ross regularly. He sells a T-shirt that reads “I’m gonna call the cops” on his website.)
“Your adolescent behavior is becoming old. It’s tying up our resources. It’s costing money. It’s costing the criminal justice system money to take care of these things,” Sarasota County Sheriff Tom Knight said in a press conference last week.
Police charged him with a felony count of impersonating a police officer, which is punishable by up to five years in prison. He was arrested and jailed before being released on a $10,000 bond, the Miami Herald reported .
And after years of ill-conceived pranks in his Florida hometown, law enforcement is getting sick of his schtick . In a 2017 interview with Tosh.0, Ross described himself as having “I think like five or six” arrests stemming from stunts he filmed.
At the time, those bookings included a battery case for giving wedgies (he served three months’ probation), disorderly conduct for jumping over cops at a picnic table (he paid a fine and did community service), and stealing stop signs (the charges were dismissed after he completed community service).
For some YouTubers, however, an arrest can be a viewership blessing. An entire genre of video-makers called “ First Amendment Auditors ” film themselves in verbal confrontations with police, which often lead to their arrest and, if they’re lucky, a viral video.
Like Ross’s videos, the auditor scene thrives on a competitive YouTube culture, where only the most audacious creators make it big, and obnoxious pranks sometimes have the biggest payoff. Some of those stunts, like a YouTuber who faked an active shooter situation at Disney World , and a YouTube livestreamer who faked a bomb threat on air , aren’t funny by any stretch of the imagination.
In his 2017 Tosh.0 interview, Ross tried to define the line between good-natured trolling and outright harassment.
""Prank is something absurd, and there needs to be a victim, but it can't too absurd where when you reveal the prank, they're still angry at you,” he said.
Some on his past “pranks” like kissing a stranger on the lips while she slept on a beach, or stepping on a stranger’s stomach while dressed as Lego, might leave the subjects angry even after the “reveal.” And after Ross allegedly impersonated a police officer, cops aren’t having his punchline.
“It’s one thing to make a scene in an attempt to become famous on YouTube but it’s another to put people on edge by pretending to be an officer of the law,” Sheriff Knight said. READ THIS LIST"
Whoopi Goldberg Intervenes in Off-the-Rails Meghan McCain-Joy Behar Battle Over Immigration,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/whoopi-goldberg-intervenes-in-off-the-rails-meghan-mccain-joy-behar-battle-over-immigration,"NOT TODAY Whoopi Goldberg Intervenes in Off-the-Rails Meghan McCain-Joy Behar Battle Over Immigration ‘We’re not gonna do this,’ Whoopi exclaimed while trying to get between her two co-hosts whose infamously hostile on-air relationship boiled over once again. 04.08.19 2:04 PM ET The View/ABC
Just as things were about to yet again go off the rails between The View co-hosts and frequent sparring partners Joy Behar and Meghan McCain Monday morning, host Whoopi Goldberg stepped in and told the two combatants, “We’re not going to do this.”
During the show’s opening discussion on Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s Sunday evening resignation , McCain spoke at length about immigration being a winning issue for President Trump in 2020 if “we sit here and act like there isn’t a crisis,” adding that it’s not only “crazy people living in border states” who are worried about it.
When Behar noted that Nielsen’s replacement, acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan , wants to send aid to Central American countries and that would be “the way to solve the problem,” McCain spoke over her: “Give a Nicaraguan a house? We’ve had a bunch of liberal guests who don’t want to send in aid at all.”
“I’ve listened to you, let me finish,” Behar shot back.
“It’s part of your job to listen to me,” McCain huffed.
Behar, who was reportedly close to walking off the show during a spat with McCain late last year, shot her co-host a hostile stare as the audience sensed the two were about to once again throw down.
Goldberg, who recently returned to the air following a near-death battle with pneumonia , wasn’t having it and prevented the show from devolving into a Joy-Meghan brawl.
“Here’s what’s not gonna happen today—we’re not gonna do this,” she exclaimed. “Everybody gets a conversation piece, everybody gets to say their piece, and we don’t need to comment if we don’t like what we’re hearing. Just let folks talk.”
Turning to Behar, Goldberg told her to “finish what you’re saying,” prompting a stunned Behar to reply that she “forgot what it was now” as the crowd cheered Goldberg.
This latest McCain-Behar kerfuffle comes days after the two battled over the meaning of “democratic socialism ,” leading McCain to complain that Behar didn’t think she was smart and grousing about how an absent Goldberg wasn’t there to referee the segment."

Scouted By The Beast
Post-high school, I never thought I’d wear a backpack again. And yet, my new overnight bag is a backpack. Well, sort of. The Caraa Studio is a shape-shifting bag that’s a backpack one second, crossbody the next, and then finally a two-handled satchel to cover any kind of transport you could need.
It’s sleek and minimal but has some secrets too. The back panel and shoulder straps are padded and covered in moisture-wicking mesh for comfort and breathability. The large interior compartment has pockets for everything from your shoes (in their own waterproof pouch), to your Kindle, to your gym pass. The exterior pocket has a vertical zip for easy-access of things like your phone, external battery, passport, and more.
As someone that tends to do overnights on weekends at friends’ or visiting my parents, the Caraa Studio has been a game changer for me. On nights where I’m not trekking with my laptop, I can stash a change of clothes and shoes, makeup and toiletries, and my Kindle to read on my commute easily in this low-profile bag. I can toss it over my shoulder if I’m packing lightly or easily attached the backpack straps to free up my hands for whatever else I need to carry. Other Convertible Backpacks To Consider:
The Maestro Bag , $895 from Senreve: It may not be an overnight bag, but this powerhouse 3-in-1 is crafted from Italian leather and is scratch and water-resistant.
Abera Convertible Backpack , $198 from ABLE: If you’re leaning more towards the tote bag option, this gives you the structure of a tote with the ease of a backpack or crossbody with a couple of simple steps.
côte&ciel Garonne Ballistic Backpack , $325 from Zappos: Made from water and abrasion-resistant ballistic nylon, this bag can swap from a crossbody duffle to a backpack in one fell swoop.

Scouted: The Corkcicle Canteen Holds an Entire Bottle of Wine at the Ideal Temperature for Perfect Transport,www.thedailybeast.com,jillian.lucas@thedailybeast.com (Jillian Lucas),04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/review-the-corkcicle-canteen-is-the-only-way-you-should-store-wine,"Scouted By The Beast
When it comes to enjoying a glass of wine after work, I seldom remember that I most likely have a bottle of wine I had opened the last time I wanted to imbibe. It’s a complete waste of money and I’m working on it, okay? In the meantime, the Corkcicle Canteen helps me be a more responsible casual drinker.
The Canteen is technically a large water bottle, but it just so happens to perfectly fit an entire bottle of wine. Coincidence? I think not, my friend. After I open a bottle of wine and pour myself a glass, I dump the remainder of it into the Canteen, screw the top on, and pop it back in the fridge. It stays cold and fresh until I want to enjoy another glass (usually the following night, but sometimes longer).
It comes in a multitude of colors (mine is Gloss Turquoise ) like a classic bar-style Brushed Steel , a color-blocked option called Modern Rose , and a marble-like Wood Snowdrift . It has completely changed how I drink and store wine, and it’s perfect for transporting said wine to an outdoor gathering where glass may not be welcomed (I took it white water rafting and camping and it was a hit). It’s lightweight but triple-insulated, so it’ll keep your wine chilled for up to 25 hours. The non-slip silicone bottom means you can put it down on plastic patio furniture by the pool without worrying about knocking it over. You can even get a cap for it that has a straw to sip easily with no judgment.
So, when it comes to keeping your wine at the perfect temp, skip the pretense and dump it into the Corkcicle Canteen and call it a day. Other Insulated Bottles Perfect For Your Wine:
S'well Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle , $38.45 on Amazon: S'well makes some really great water bottles, and their 25 oz version is no different, with the brand's classic bubble-bottom shape and triple-walled construction.
MIRA 25 oz Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Water Bottle , $16.96 on Amazon: Want insulation on a budget? This under-$20 option from MIRA gives you multiple color options and a double-walled, vacuum-sealed insulation.
Thermo Tank Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle , $23.97 on Amazon: If you're all about utility, this double-walled bottle from Thermo Tank features a hidden layer of copper to protect your liquid even more.

The State Department publicly designated 16 people for their roles in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul's Saudi Arabian consulate late last year, according to the Associated Press. The designation reportedly makes the 16 people and their family members ineligible for entry into the U.S. The list reportedly includes Saud al-Qahtani—a former aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—and Maher Mutreb, who was part of the crown prince’s foreign travel “entourage.” After the Saudi government denied having anything to do with Khashoggi’s disappearance, officials eventually confirmed that he had died. The CIA reportedly concluded that it was the crown prince himself who ordered Khashoggi's killing after he had written a number of columns critical to the Saudi government and the crown prince in the Post .

"Secret Service Agent Infects Own Computer With Mar-a-Lago Malware, and Tech Community Snickers - The Daily Beast",www.thedailybeast.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/secret-service-agent-infects-own-computer-with-mar-a-lago-malware-and-tech-community-snickers,"AMATEUR HOUR Techies Snicker at Secret Service Agent’s Mar-a-Lago Malware An agent stuck one of the USB drives from an unannounced Chinese national’s electronics stash into his agency computer, infecting it—and prompting widespread derision. 04.08.19 8:16 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty/Reuters/Kevin Lamarque
A Secret Service agent investigating Yujing Zhang’s visit to Mar-a-Lago infected one of the agency’s own computers with the malware carried in by the unannounced Chinese national, a move that provoked wide derision Monday from computer security professionals.
“You don’t put an unknown USB into your computer,” said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer at Veracode. “That’s in all the training everyone gets, even in your dumb corporate training. You even tell your mom that.”
Wysopal’s tweet highlighting the apparent gaffe earned more than 3,000 retweets Monday, as the computer security community executed a collective face-palm . “Whoa! Never seen that USB execution thing before!” quipped Kaspersky researcher Kurt Baumgartner. “Sounds like an agent trying to crack the case before the cyber team got there,” opined Eric O’Neill, a former FBI surveillance specialist.
In a sworn affidavit filed at Zhang’s arrest , the agency said it discovered the “malicious malware” during a “preliminary forensic examination” of the thumb drive. The new details that emerged at a hearing in West Palm Beach sound a lot more like the Secret Service just plugged the USB drive into one of its computers.
The biggest giveaway is that the review was cut short when the examining agent noticed “a file” installing itself on the agent’s machine. “He stated that he had to immediately stop the analysis and shut off his computer to halt the corruption,” testified the Secret Service’s Samuel Ivanovich, according to The New York Times . The thumb drive’s behavior was “very out of the ordinary,” Ivanovich added.
Forensics examiners don’t usually interrupt malware when it’s in the middle of giving itself away, security experts point out. “For all you know, if the thing is doing something, and you pull it out, it might detect that it’s been seen,” said Wysopal. “Forensically it makes no sense.”
“Let it run,” said Michael Borohovski, co-founder of Tinfoil Security and an intelligence-community veteran. Borohovski notes that a professional forensic environment runs within a virtual machine where there’s no concern of infection. “Watch it run. Attach a debugger. Then restore your safe snapshot and do it all over again to your heart’s content.”
The Secret Service didn’t respond to inquiries for this story.
Government agencies have been rightfully leery of USB drives since a Russian virus used them to infiltrate U.S. military networks on a massive scale in 2008. The same technique was also used against Iran in a partially successfully cyberattack on a uranium enrichment facility that was reportedly engineered by the U.S. and Israel.
“USB drives have been involved in many cases involving the loss of sensitive information,” reads a 2010 advisory from the Secret Service’s parent organisation, the Department of Homeland Security. “Their small size and increasingly high storage capacity has been instrumental in the loss of or theft of sensitive information from enterprise networks.”
A former Secret Service cybercrime agent told The Daily Beast that the agents were more likely screening the device to see if it was a fake USB drive concealing something nefarious, the way TSA screeners once made travelers switch on their laptops. When the thumb drive proved real, then turned and attacked, they’d have realized they were in over their heads.
“Most of the basic training that agents get is just around how the internet works and the basics on digital media,” said Levi Gundert, vice president of intelligence and risk at Recorded Future. “Typically the advice is, ‘Look, if you’re in a situation and it’s anything even remotely complex, you need to get an agent who’s trained in digital forensics.’ The agents who do digital forensics, that’s all that they do.”
Yujing Zhang is being held on charges of making false statements to federal agents and entering a restricted area. Reached by the The Daily Beast, the Secret Service had no immediate comment on the malware incident. The agency is still reeling after Trump fired Secret Service Director Randolph “Tex” Alles on Monday as part of a purge of DHS leadership."

Disgraced TV star Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli could face a minimum of two years in the slammer over the bribes they allegedly channeled to a crew coach to get their daughters into USC, even if they plead out a deal with the feds.
While her fellow accused Felicity Huffman could spend as little as four months inside, Loughlin is likely to face a much heftier jail sentence due to the amount of money she is alleged to have forked out to get her daughters into the elite school.
TMZ reports that her alleged payment of $550,000 lifts her alleged crime into a different sentencing bracket, where the recommended minimum jail time is between 24 and 30 months.
Quoting sources connected to the case, TMZ says all of the parents in the college cheating scandal have been offered plea deals, but prosecutors will only accept pleas with prison time attached. So far, 13 have accepted the deals offered while another 37 have yet to proceed.
Huffman reached a deal on Monday and issued a statement saying: “I am in full acceptance of my guilt and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions. I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college.”
Prosecutors alleged that parents involved in what authorities have called the “largest college admissions scam prosecuted by the Justice Department” paid admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer, 58, more than $25 million total to rig test scores, cheat on SAT exams, and bribe college coaches.
In some cases, the complaint noted, the students didn’t even play the sports for which they were “recruited.”
Singer has pleaded guilty to charges including racketeering, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice. READ THIS LIST"

In the end, though, you kind of wish it was just about her. Kevin Fallon 04.09.19 4:46 AM ET
A good, show-stopping production number builds to its climax. No one knows that better than famed choreographer Bob Fosse and Broadway triple-threat phenom Gwen Verdon . “You don’t want to give anything away. Let them come to you,” Bob tells Gwen in their first meeting during the latter’s audition for Damn Yankees in a pivotal early scene in the new FX series Fosse/Verdon .
The question with the splashy new drama, which premieres Tuesday night, then becomes whether viewers—not the captive audience in a Broadway theater, and in fact with more than 500 options of other TV shows to watch—will be willing to wait for the good stuff.
Fosse/Verdon is a seduction, to be sure. How could it not be? But it’s a slow dance at first, one with a few stumbles in the choreography—and one with a misunderstanding of who should be taking the lead. NEWSLETTERS The Daily Beast’s Obsessed Everything we can’t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture. Subscribe By Clicking ""Subscribe"" you agree to have read the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
There’s a lot of meaning packed into that brisk title. Fosse/Verdon is about a partnership, one that, over the course of three decades completely reinvented musical theatre and film, all the while taking a great toll on the conflicted lovers and performers at the center.
He choreographed and directed, and his work on Damn Yankees , Cabaret , Sweet Charity , Pippin , The Pajama Game , and Chicago is indelible. She was a performer and muse, winning four Tony Awards in five years, and creating some of the theater’s greatest roles: Charity in Sweet Charity , Lola in Damn Yankees , and Roxie Hart in Chicago.
The slash mark in the title, though, suggests something more, both a blurring of and a tension between the two icons, played by Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams . Fosse/Verdon spotlights just how much of Fosse’s creative output is owed to Verdon’s input.
When she shows up to the troubled Cabaret film shoot to offer her eye and her ideas, she rescues a doomed production, in turn minting a cinema classic. “I just know how to speak Bob,” she shrugs. “It’s my native tongue.”
When he is in a rut while choreographing a Damn Yankees number, an all-night rehearsal emerges at sunrise with Verdon dancing a Broadway triumph—moves that are indelibly hers, but the credit for which are given to him. “That’s what Bobby does,” Verdon, his wife at the time, says. “He takes what’s special about a girl and he makes it his own.”
The life and times of the tortured artist is a story that’s been done. In fact, it’s been done about Bob Fosse, with his 1979 semi-autobiographical film All That Jazz . So when Fosse/Verdon hits those beats—the affairs, the drugs, the insomnia, the crushing pressure of creating, the demons threatening brilliance—the series starts to feel rudimentary and stale. What’s fresh, and timely, is the reminder that he was no independent genius.
He was brilliant, but it was Verdon’s brilliance right beside and in tandem with his that made the work transformative, and caused the seismic shift in dance, performance, and cinematic style that he is exalted for. Celebrating that partnership certainly resonates in a #MeToo era .
The show indicts Fosse as a philanderer, training a near-constant empathetic lens on Verdon’s plight: one of the most talented performers and creative minds in Broadway history, who steps out of the spotlight to raise her daughter and feels the constant pull back to the stage. She channels that desire through willingly collaborating with her husband, with her vital contributions a veritable open secret in the business.
Negotiating the pleasure derived from her work and the indignities of Fosse’s reputation for mistreating her, we learn, became maybe her life’s most impressive dance.
But this, the series’ most captivating narrative and the reason to watch, ironically exposes its biggest shortcoming. If we’re properly exasperated with hearing about the talented woman behind the male savant, isn’t time we just made the story about the woman already? The thing I walked away with after watching the batch of critics’ screeners for Fosse/Verdon is that, in the end, I’d rather just be watching Verdon. “ ‘I just know how to speak Bob,’ she shrugs. ‘It’s my native tongue.’ ”
To that end, Williams gives my favorite performance of her career in this.
Williams is an obvious talent—four Oscar nominations certainly attest to that—but for many, she’s an acquired, if not polarizing one. Her performances, especially memorable recent ones in My Week With Marilyn and All the Money in the World , tend to be mannered and theatrical in a way that can be jarring. But what better venue for a skilled theatrical actress than playing one of the greatest Broadway performers of all time?
Williams charms with her singing and dancing here. (This is a bit of meta casting. She recently played Sally Bowles in the Broadway revival of Cabaret .) But it’s a scene in the third episode that represents the high point of the series—at least as much as we have seen, and which we can’t imagine being topped.
It’s during a flashback to Gwen’s breakout role in Can-Can . On opening night, she exits the stage after a dance to quick-change for her next scene, but the applause is so rapturous she must come back out, covered with a towel, to acknowledge it.
Williams cycles through the emotions of a person transformed with moving precision. This is a dancer who left her then-husband and baby son to pursue a dream. At first, she’s shell-shocked by the response, then acknowledges it, understands it, and, finally, relishes it. It’s the moment that she realizes the stage is where she belongs—and understands the negotiations with her personal life she would have to make to stay there.
For a theater lover, these scenes are a dream.
Fosse/Verdon in part plays like a game of “I Spy” of cameos of Broadway legends, many played by current Broadway stars. It’s Shirley MacLaine (played by Laura Osnes)! Neil Simon (Nate Corddry)! Joel Grey (Ethan Slater)! Chita Rivera (Bianca Marroquin)! Ann Reinking (Margaret Qually)! “Uncle Paddy” who babysits Bob and Gwen’s daughter? Ha, it’s Paddy Chayefsky, played by Norbert Leo Butz! And Kelli Barrett, performing a full-throated “Mein Herr,” is a phenomenal Liza Minnelli.
The making of these classic pieces is an integral aspect of the series, and it’s a blast to watch the creation of “Whatever Lola Wants,” or the staging of “Big Spender,” or the corrections of the shoulder from here-to-there on a Kit Kat Club dancer during the filming of scenes from Cabaret.
Fosse and Verdon’s work is synonymous with smoke, sex, sweat, and style. Sometimes these scenes remind you how much you wish there was more of it in the show.
The more surreal, stylistic elements come when the series jumps back and forth, often dizzyingly, in time. In one episode, we’re chronicling the Cabaret film shoot in 1972. In the next, it’s 1955 and we’re watching rehearsals for Damn Yankees and the beginnings of the couple’s affair. We flash forward to their old age, flashback to the respective performers as children, and stop over in telling moments through their professional careers and personal lives.
But a sense of smoky darkness is absent in the series’ more polished production aesthetics. You miss some of the sex that Fosse’s choreography intrinsically telegraphs. You want the sweat that drips with the raw pheromones of these inextricable personalities, or from the grueling precision of their work. You want more style. More razzle-dazzle, if you will.
To that end, there’s a specter haunting Fosse/Verdon , and that’s the ghost of Ryan Murphy.
Most people assume, based on the subject matter and the fact that this is a FX series, that it is a Ryan Murphy series . It’s actually from the creative team behind Hamilton . Lin-Manuel Miranda , Thomas Kail, and Andy Blankenbuehler all have roles behind the scenes. The series is certainly competent, one collaboration that changed the face of American theater telling the story of another.
But you’re looking for more of a Fosse shoulder roll, the extra tap in the time step, the unexpected contortion in the jazz number—the kinds of quirks that made Fosse and Verdon singular and unique. Their relationship was anything but by the book, and you wish this dramatization wasn’t afraid to go a little more off-script."
Chris Evans’ ‘Both Sides’ Political News Site Is Thanos-Level Dumb,www.thedailybeast.com,Danielle Tcholakian,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/chris-evans-both-sides-political-news-site-is-thanos-level-dumb,"GALAXY BRAIN Chris Evans’ ‘Both Sides’ Political News Site Is Thanos-Level Dumb Captain America is set to launch a ‘non-partisan civic engagement’ project where politicians from both sides of the aisle answer the questions they like. What a terrible idea. opinion Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/Getty
Chris Evans, heretofore known as America’s Hottest Chris , is getting into politics. Or at least, that’s how the reveal of his new “secret, non-partisan civic engagement” venture has been framed.
Here is what we know about “A Starting Point,” Evans’ “secret” (?) “civic engagement” (?) project: It will be a website It will feature interviews with politicians from both parties
The project became public when a video Evans sent out to Congress members got leaked (or “leaked”) to CNN . Apparently Evans was inspired to create this platform when he wanted to “get both sides of an issue in a succinct way that he can trust.”
And for some reason, instead of asking policy researchers, or academics, or librarians, or journalists, or anyone else who might actually be a “non-partisan” expert on various issues, he chose to ask: partisan politicians.
This whole thing appears to have been teased back when Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) —who infamously was an administrator on a Facebook group that circulated conspiracy theories and white nationalist memes—showed off his Captain America glass eye to Evans. Just so we’re clear on the state of our nation: an American 2-year-old with a genetic condition can’t get a wheelchair covered by his insurance company , but a congressman can have a Captain America glass eye for fun. Sure, Chris Evans, the problem with America is definitely that politicians don’t get enough of a chance to talk about whatever they want.
Here’s the thing: If you can hear the phrase “both sides” in contemporary American discourse and not immediately see red flags, you are in deep trouble, pal.
First of all, there are more than two positions on any given political issue. Democrats do not all agree, nor do Republicans. There are liberals and moderates and conservatives—a whole spectrum of ideology. And the idea that framing every issue as something in which you choose between two parties’ positions will somehow reduce partisanship seems very flawed.
Secondly, not all political issues in contemporary America have more than one “side.”
Here are some issues on which you might benefit from understanding different positions: Medicare for All/Universal Healthcare/Single Payer Open borders
Here are some issues that do not fall under that category: White nationalism Tracking the menstrual cycles of imprisoned immigrant girls to prevent them from obtaining abortions Putting immigrant children in cages Separating immigrant children from their parents and then losing track of their origins so that they can’t be reunited
In fact, most issues would benefit more from fact-checking than from a view of “both sides.” Are claims about the costs incurred by undocumented immigrants accurate? How many children have been lost by the federal government? Would universal healthcare really be prohibitively expensive?
Evans’ video doesn’t give any indication of the “policy issues” or “common questions” to which he is going to get politicians to provide clear information. The only question we do see politicians answer is “what inspired you to get into politics in the first place,” and shockingly, no one says “my massive, ravenous ego” or “an insatiable thirst for power.” Weird.
In the video, Evans tells the politicians, “This is a chance for you to talk about issues that matter to you,” because apparently the many campaign stops, televised appearances, and Sunday morning talk shows are not enough. He tells them he’d like to keep their answers to a minute long and they all laugh about how hard that will be, though anyone who’s watched a political debate knows that politicians can very easily spend a full minute not answering a clear and direct question.
And then, while promoting his website that is supposed to be “no spin,” he tells the politicians he’s offering them “a chance not only to galvanize your base, but you might change some minds.”
How is this “no spin?”
Evans’ fundamental question—“Why isn’t there a place that I can go to hear both sides of an issue in a succinct way that I can trust?”—is truly baffling to me. Why on earth would you trust politicians more than journalists?
There’s a couple telling moments in the video. Evans says, “Right now, a lot of people don’t buy the things they read and hear,” and a politician responds, “there’s a lot of mistrust.” The clip conveniently cuts off before specifying where there’s mistrust, but anyone who has been paying attention over the last couple of years knows where that sentence was going.
“In the media.”
Journalists work very hard every day to hold politicians accountable to the people who pay their salaries. They work really hard to get politicians to answer questions—something that should be considered a politician’s responsibility, part of their job. And very few journalists have celebrity power they can use to persuade politicians to talk to them.
And now here we have Chris Evans telling politicians he’s got a bunch of questions for them, but “if you don’t like any of ‘em, we’ll skip ‘em” and “if you don’t like any of your answers, we can do ‘em over.”
This isn’t accountability. This is simply giving politicians a new platform to push their agendas. And the idea that a website like this is where you’ll get news without “spin” feeds into the misconception that has weakened journalism to a truly frightening degree.
Journalists do not “spin.” They report. Political spokespersons “spin.” Politicians “spin.” Pundits “spin.” It feels like this was something we used to understand, and I’m not sure why we don’t anymore.
When I was a news reporter, I didn’t care about changing people’s minds. Changing them from what? To what? Why? I had no stake in that. I cared about informing people, helping people feel less unsure and more savvy, shining a light on the way their government, or their city, worked. I cared about holding power to account. And politicians have power.
So do celebrities. And I’d love to see one of them use their power to do something about the national mistrust that has been sown, pitting Americans against each other. Journalists are no different than anyone else. They have bills to pay. They worry about their rights, about gas prices, about their safety. Wouldn’t dismantling this myth of the nefarious journalist, hell-bent on manipulating the people despite having nothing to gain from doing so, go a lot further in “promoting respectful discourse?”
We have a president who repeatedly calls journalists the enemy of the people. You know who benefits from mistrust in journalism? Politicians. When you doubt the accountability journalists provide, it gives powerful people cover to get away with abusing their power. READ THIS LIST"
Why Comedian Ron Funches Turned Down Netflix: You ‘Don’t Tell Me What Comedy Is’,www.thedailybeast.com,matt.wilstein@thedailybeast.com (Matt Wilstein),04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/ron-funches-turned-down-netflix-for-comedy-central-you-dont-tell-me-what-comedy-is,"Subscribe to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts
Earlier this year, comedian Ron Funches posted a semi-cryptic ( and since-deleted ) tweet responding to fans who wanted to know why his first hour-long stand-up special Giggle Fit was on Comedy Central instead of Netflix.
Beside the word Netflix, he put one money bag emoji. Comedy Central got three. But as Funches reveals to me on this week’s episode of The Last Laugh podcast , it was a bit more complicated than that.
“They didn’t offer me an hour,” Funches says of Netflix, which pitched him on the idea of appearing as part of The Standups , a collection of half-hour specials from comedians like Nikki Glaser, Kyle Kinane, Aparna Nancherla and others. “They said they didn’t see me as an hour comedian at that time,” he added. “And I firmly disagreed.”
Funches says Netflix tried to “convince” him by saying they “get more engagement” on half-hours due to viewers’ shorter attention spans. “What I didn’t enjoy was them trying to sell me on a half-hour—that they are trying to tell me what comedy is, that people don’t watch hours anymore,” he says. “And I was like, then why are you making them? Then why are the big contracts you’re giving going out to the people with hours?”
He’s right. The biggest comedians on Netflix are still producing hour-long specials. Just this past month, Amy Schumer and Kevin Hart both put out new hours. Two years ago, the streaming service made headlines by offering contracts worth tens of millions of dollars to comics like Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle and Louis C.K.—another comedian we discuss during the episode—to make hour-long specials.
“To me, if you just were honest and said, ‘Hey, maybe in a couple of years,’ but they were never honest with me,” Funches says. “They just tried to sell me and tell me what comedy is. And I’m the comedian. I tell you what comedy is! Executives don’t tell me what comedy is. I tell you .”
So that’s the real reason he ended up going to Comedy Central. Funches also confirms the network offered him “substantially more money” to make his first hour, Giggle Fit , which got higher ratings than the average special on that network by a wide margin.
That makes him a hotter commodity heading into his next special, whereas if he had gone with Netflix, he says he would have been under contract to work with them again—but only if they wanted him. And since Netflix notoriously doesn’t share streaming numbers with talent, he wouldn’t have had the same leverage when it came time to renegotiate.
Still, Funches knows that many more people would have seen his half-hour on Netflix than will see his hour on Comedy Central.
“Oh, absolutely,” he says. “But for me, that’s no different than anytime any promoter has come at me in that way, that’s always been a red flag: ‘Do it for exposure,’” he says. “To me it was a no-brainer. My son does not eat exposure.”

"Trump’s Transgender Troop Ban Marks the Dark Return of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’",www.thedailybeast.com,samantha.allen@thedailybeast.com (Samantha Allen),04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-transgender-troop-ban-marks-the-dark-return-of-dont-ask-dont-tell,"HAPPENING AGAIN Trump’s Transgender Troop Ban Marks the Dark Return of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ There’s only one guaranteed way for transgender people to remain in the military after April 12: Pretend you aren’t transgender. Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast
Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell is coming back.
That’s the only way to convey the urgency of what’s going to happen on April 12, when the Trump administration’s transgender troop ban goes into effect.
Gay , lesbian , and bisexual members of the military served for years in secrecy, because coming out meant discharge until Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell was repealed in 2011.
Now, transgender service members will have to suffer in silence, too, just three years after the Obama administration told them they would be allowed to serve openly.
The Trump administration has gone to great lengths to claim that the transgender troop ban is not a ban. The written policy itself is byzantine, laden with enough jargon to give the Defense Department plausible deniability on that point. But it is definitely a ban. Once you understand how it works, there is no other conclusion you can make.
So forget the jargon and the legal battles and picture this:
You are in the military and you have a health condition recognized as valid by virtually every major medical association . It doesn’t affect your ability to serve in the long term and there’s a proven treatment that costs the military next to nothing . But if you get diagnosed with that health condition, you lose your job.
If we were talking about knee conditions, this policy would be patently ridiculous. Plenty of service members receive some form of knee surgery and go back to active duty [ PDF ].
But because the condition is gender dysphoria, nearly a third of Americans —and more importantly, the current presidential administration —believe that you are unfit to serve. And that small but powerful group of people is going to sideline your career at all costs.
After April 12, a diagnosis of gender dysphoria will almost certainly mean discharge for those who are already in the military—and it will keep out potential recruits.
By making gender dysphoria a disqualifying condition, the Trump administration can ban transgender troops without admitting that they are banning transgender troops ; rather, they can argue that they are simply pushing out people with gender dysphoria. “After the Trump administration’s new policy goes into effect on April 12, it will be virtually impossible for a transgender service member to join or remain in the armed forces without severely compromising their identity.”
That’s disingenuous because the Venn diagram of transgender people and people who experience gender dysphoria, while not a perfect circle, is pretty damn close to one.
After the Trump administration’s new policy goes into effect on April 12, it will be virtually impossible for a transgender service member to join or remain in the armed forces without severely compromising their identity.
(In fact, the only transgender people who will be allowed to serve openly are those who have already received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria by April 12 .)
A memo on the impact of the policy provided to The Daily Beast by The Palm Center, a think tank that studies LGBT issues in the military, makes it clear that there’s only one guaranteed way for transgender people to remain in the military after April 12: Pretend you aren’t transgender.
If that sounds familiar, it should. That’s exactly what gay, lesbian, and bisexual soldiers had to do under Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, which the Palm Center calls a “perfect parallel” for the transgender troop ban.
“It is ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ all over again,” the Palm Center notes.
In fact, there are a dizzying number of ways in which the Trump administration’s new policy encourages transgender people to remain in the closet.
If you’re transgender and you’re hoping to join the military after April 12, you are out of luck. If you’ve had any sort of hormonal or surgical treatment for gender dysphoria, the Palm Center memo notes, the door will be completely closed.
If you have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria but haven’t yet received any medical care for it, you can only serve if you”have lived in [your] birth gender for three years immediately prior,” according to the Palm Center breakdown. In other words, the military will allow you to join—but only if you suppress your transgender identity for years at a time, potentially incurring serious psychological damage in the process .
But let’s say you are already in the military when the policy goes into effect and have yet to come out. If you need to keep your job to support yourself or your family—or simply because it’s the career path you’ve chosen and you don’t want to give the president the satisfaction of tweeting you into a different one—you will be incentivized to stay in the closet at all costs. “A transgender service member’s only reasonable approach to career preservation would be to avoid medical or mental-health contacts that could lead to a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.”
Maybe you’re suffering from depression as a result of untreated gender dysphoria. Do you see a mental health care provider and risk letting slip the root cause of your distress—or do you avoid medical treatment altogether?
The Palm Center believes many will choose the latter option: “A transgender service member’s only reasonable approach to career preservation would be to avoid medical or mental-health contacts that could lead to a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.”
If you do end up getting diagnosed with gender dysphoria, whether intentionally or unintentionally, you will be “subject to administrative separation,” as the Palm Center notes, with only one extremely unlikely path that ends in you keeping your job: a doctor has to say that you don’t need transition-related medical care and you have to be “willing and able to serve in [your] birth gender.”
But as Palm Center Director Aaron Belkin pointed out to The Daily Beast, the military gets to decide who is “willing and able, not the service member, so “once that information is out of the bag, the service member has no control over where that leads.”
In effect, you have to be willing to perform a sort of makeshift conversion therapy on yourself, convincing yourself that you don’t need to transition, in order to even have a chance of staying inside. Even then, the decision is out of your hands.
But the cruelty doesn’t stop there. If you can’t pretend to be your birth gender, you will not be discharged right away but will instead—in the words of the policy itself—be “formally counseled on [your] failure to adhere to such standards” and be “given an opportunity to correct those deficiencies.”
In effect, the Palm Center notes, this warning system essentially blames transgender service members for not being able to go without medically-necessary health care. It also encourages transgender people to try to suppress their gender identity even longer. “The only way to get any transgender health care while still in the military would be to sacrifice your job—and even then, you would get kicked out in such short order that you wouldn’t make more than a dent in your transition.”
Imagine, though, that you have been living with gender dysphoria for so long that you can no longer delay transition—but the military, in addition to being your employer, is also your health care provider.
The only way to get any transgender health care while still in the military would be to sacrifice your job—and even then, you would get kicked out in such short order that you wouldn’t make more than a dent in your transition.
As the Palm Center notes, the policy may allow transgender service members to receive treatment while they’re waiting to be separated depending on how it gets interpreted—but because “administrative separations are designed to be processed quickly,” any transition-related medical care you get on your way out “is likely to be short term.”
Adding insult to injury is the fact that transgender service members who are forced into hiding will also be serving alongside the “very small number” of transgender people, according to the Palm Center, who are allowed to be out because they received a diagnosis in time and were grandfathered in.
In fact, the Palm Center believes that the policy will even allow “grandfathered enlisted persons to commission in the future,” which means they could become officers.
Picture, then, being told that gender dysphoria makes you unfit to serve, while your handful of openly transgender colleagues get to further their careers, all because they met an arbitrary deadline that you couldn’t reach. (That would be roughly equivalent to the Department of Defense announcing during the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell era that gay men born before 1980 could be out, loud, and proud but gay men born after 1980 couldn’t tell anyone or else they will get kicked out.)
This will be the reality for transgender troops come April 12, and much like Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, it will be a psychological minefield for anyone who tries to navigate it.
But ultimately, history is going to repeat itself: After April 12, we will begin seeing discharges from the military, perhaps slowly at first. We will learn— based on the level of public outrage over those tragic stories—the success of the Trump administration’s tactic of hiding the ban beneath layers of bureaucracy. “Whether through the pressure of public opinion or a change in presidential administration, transgender people will serve openly again, just as cisgender lesbian, gay, and bisexual troops are serving now.”
We will see whether or not the rollback of LGBT rights in the military manages to break through an intense news cycle, because so far the imminent implementation of the ban hasn’t seemed to garner as much media attention as it should have.
Then one day, whether through the pressure of public opinion or a change in presidential administration, transgender people will serve openly again, just as cisgender lesbian, gay, and bisexual troops are serving now.
But in the meantime, transgender troops will be forced to live under the equivalent to an unethical policy that the country scrapped eight years ago.
Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell will be back; the only difference is the target."
"This Is Your Legacy, Kirstjen Nielsen",www.thedailybeast.com,Kate Chaltain,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kirstjen-nielsen-this-is-your-legacy-as-dhs-secretary,"Chris Kleponis/AP
Dear Secretary Nielsen,
When I was a child I read every book I could find about the Holocaust. I am not Jewish, so the stories I read were not my family’s story, but they nevertheless consumed me as I tried to make sense of what made some ordinary people choose to hurt their neighbors, while others chose to risk their lives to save strangers. I hoped that I was the kind of person that would have made the right choice.
Eventually, I grew up, and became an immigration lawyer. Over the past ten years, I have represented hundreds of asylum seekers in immigration court and before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. I also worked for eleven months as an asylum officer for the Department of Homeland Security adjudicating asylum applications on behalf of our government. I still have friends who work in various immigration capacities for the government, including for ICE, and I know decent and intelligent men and women who still work there.
I am not “dirty,” as the President and former Attorney General have called immigration lawyers in their speeches, and the asylum process, overall, is not “a scam.” I do not tell my clients to lie and I don’t help people if I have reason to believe that they are lying. I have seen enough photographs of people’s murdered loved ones, seen their scars from beatings, electrocutions and cigarette burns, read forensic psychiatric reports detailing the PTSD, depression, and anxiety that rape survivors experience, to know that humans can be brutally evil to one another and that our asylum laws provide human beings crucial, life-saving protection.
So, last summer I traveled to southeast Texas to help parents and children who had been separated at the border and detained at the Karnes Detention Center under your agency’s family separation policy. E and her ten-year-old son M were the first family to seek legal help. They had been separated for thirty days—during which time E did not know where her son had been. They had been reunited at Karnes just 48 hours earlier.
M would not look at me and could barely maintain eye contact with his mother. E explained that her son was both clingy and angry with her since they had been reunified; he rejected her attempts to hug and touch him but he insisted on sharing her single bed at night. E was extremely worried about what had happened to him during the separation and what effect it was going to have on him long-term.
E told us about how she had been raped and beaten at gunpoint for nine months in Honduras by a man who worked as an assassin for the police. He had threatened to kill her son if E did anything to stop the abuse. When E had tried to get away from him, he found them and renewed his threats to harm her son.
As you must know, E’s story is not unique; men can do whatever they want to women in Honduras with impunity. The police, government, mafia and gangs are all connected, and conditions for women and children have only gotten worse since the U.S.-backed coup in 2009. After enduring three more months of brutal rapes, E decided that her only hope for safety was to seek asylum with her son in the United States.
E and her son crossed the Rio Grande on a raft and sought out the border patrol to request asylum. They were transported to a Customs and Border Patrol facility and immediately separated; E placed in a cold room; her son taken elsewhere in the facility with the other children in a large cage-like enclosure inside a warehouse that resembled a dog kennel. Women and children were kept on separate sides of the enclosure and were told not even to look at each other. Your officers threw cookies and partly-frozen, partly-rotten sandwiches at the women. E heard officers telling other women to drink from the toilets if they were thirsty.
The women were then shackled and transported to criminal court to be prosecuted for misdemeanor illegal border crossing where they were all sentenced to time-served. When they returned, their children were gone. When E asked for information about her son’s whereabouts, your officers told her that he had been given to Donald Trump and sent off to war. They told her that this was her fault for bringing him to the United States and that she should not ask any more questions about where he was.
Over the next thirty days E did not know what had happened to her son. She witnessed your officers literally ripping small children out of the arms of their screaming mothers. She watched as one mother desperately chased a bus full of children, screaming and crying for her child who was on board.
At some point during the separation E was able to speak to M on the phone. M did not know where he was and spent the call crying and yelling at his mother to come and get him, but E was powerless to help him. She had brought him to the United States to keep him safe, but instead of finding a safe haven she found your family separation policy, and the America that you believe was made safer because of it.
After I first met E and M, they were transported to a different detention facility where they were held for four-and-a-half more months as your agency attempted to deport them. Thanks to the efforts of the ACLU and many volunteer lawyers, including myself, M, who celebrated his 11th birthday in prison, is now living safely with his mother in Brooklyn. E reports that her son is moody, sensitive, and full of anger at her, yet hyper-vigilant about her whereabouts – E says he is not the same child that he was before they left Honduras. Nor has she been told where he was or what happened to him during their separation.
These are the consequences of the choice that you made when you did not resign in honorable protest of the family separation policy. Instead, you defended this cruel, immoral, and useless policy before Congress, despite knowing about its abuses. You may try to distance yourself from the choice you made, or perhaps say that it was a choice to follow someone else’s orders, but the fact remains that you made the wrong choice.
E, M and the countless thousands of children your choice damaged — some still separated from their families — cannot forget. I cannot forget either.
Sincerely, Kate Chaltain"
‘Italy’s Trump’ Launches a Nationalist Campaign to Destroy Europe,www.thedailybeast.com,Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau),04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/matteo-salvini-italys-trump-launches-his-alt-right-european-parliamentary-election-campaign-to-destroy-europe,"MEGA ‘Italy’s Trump’ Launches a Nationalist Campaign to Destroy Europe Italy’s Trump-loving hardline far-right leader, Matteo Salvini, wants to use European Parliament elections in May to tear Europe apart from the inside. 04.09.19 4:45 AM ET Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters
MILAN–Anyone who has followed Matteo Salvini’ s unlikely political trajectory from far-right bad boy to far-right statesman knows the man loves an audience. Whether he is posting selfies eating Nutella or posing with zealots, he knows how to work a crowd.
And so it was on Monday morning in Milan, when the leader of the far-right League–a watered down version of the former Northern League separatist party–officially launched his European Parliamentary campaign with a promise to “shake up the European Union.”
“For many Europeans, the E.U. is a nightmare,” Salvini said by way of introduction to the launch. “We hope to change that.”
Salvini hopes to spread the hardline approach that has won him favor in Italy across Europe. In less than a year, Salvini has drastically cut illegal immigration into the country by closing all ports to migrant boats, relaxed gun laws and introduced “shoot first” legislation for self defense. He has brought back a Mussolini-era “baby bonus” for Italians who have more than one child to help reverse Italy’s negative birth rate, tried to limit foreign music on Italian radios, and littered the path to citizenship with obstacles that few can overcome.
He would like to do the same across Europe, making national identity a priority. At his launch on Monday, he was flanked on either side by like-minded leaders of far-right European parties.
“There are no extremists or nostalgics among us,” Salvini said, as he described those who were worried the group represents a return to fascism or Nazism as “snobs from the radical chic Left.”
“There is no bad company at this table,” he said. “The tired debate over Fascists does not interest us. We are looking ahead to the future.”
Jörg Meuthen of Germany’s Alternative for Germany, some of whose members have been called Holocaust deniers, talked about how the rise of the far-right does not mean a return to the country’s dark past. “The Holocaust must never be forgotten,” he said when asked as much, but then added that Germany should no longer dwell on it. He called for a “180-degree turn” when it comes to Germany's continuing atonement for the crimes of Hitler’s Nazi Germany. On the sidelines of the event, he told The Daily Beast he agreed with party member Alexander Gauland who said that the Nazis “are just bird shit in more than 1,000 years of successful German history.”
Like Salvini, Meuthen believes that by taking over the European parliament, the far-right parties can decentralize European decision making and promote nationalism. Never mind that so-called ‘identitarian’ groups that focus on nationalism and shun integration of immigrants have been linked to race baiting and attacks. The attacker in Christchurch, New Zealand, had even donated to an Austrian identitarian party before shooting 50 people in two mosque attacks in March.
Despite the debacle that Brexit negotiations have become, many of the parties in Salvini’s new dream team are also eurosceptics. “Radical changes are needed – more power to our countries and less bureaucracy from Brussels,” Meuthen said, adding when asked if he would push for a Brexit style vote for Germany. “If there are moves towards building a United States of Europe, then we would want to leave.” In Italy, a poll by La Stampa newspaper over the weekend revealed that nearly 50 percent of Italians now favor a referendum vote on whether Italy should stay in the E.U.
Olli Kotro of the Finnish nationalist Finns Party and Anders Vistisen from the Danish People’s Party gushed over Salvini, and in a Trumpesque moment, each one took turns, along with Meuthen, pledging allegiance to the leader who had called them to share his stage. “I can see no finer leader among the candidates for president of the European parliament,” Kotro said when asked if he saw Salvini as the European Parliament’s future president.
Salvini’s far-right bloc is called the Europe of Nations and Freedom, or ENF, and it includes the likes of Austria’s Freedom Party and the Netherlands Party for Freedom. It also includes Marine Le Pen, who was notably absent. Salvini had just seen his soul sister in Paris last week and, when asked why she couldn’t make it to Milan for such an important launch, he said, quite characteristically, “Cazzo!” which is Italian slang for “dick” but is often used when one might say “fuck” on occasions like this.
“ Cazzo ,” he said, and then repeated it three times. “As I’ve said for the 16th time in a week, I represent all of the members. I speak for the French, the Austrians, the Dutch members, even when they aren’t here.”
Salvini’s dream is to merge his ENF bloc with the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) which includes the Danish People’s Party and the Finns party and the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD), of which the Alternative for Germany party and the newly formed Brexit Party of the UK which is comprised of hardline Brexiteers who are former UKIP Brexit campaigners. Such an alliance between these members would, as Salvini promised, shake the E.U. to its core, especially if they were able to win even a slight majority in the May elections.
The group, which, now that it has launched, will be signing up candidates from across the European Union, hopes to lure Tories if Brexit has not been finalized by May 26 when elections are held. They are also courting fringe far-right parties in Greece and Spain where issues like immigration and austerity are most troubling.
All of the leaders present share the common goal of turning the dream of the United States of Europe into something more of a loosely bound coalition of countries that share the common goals of national identity, national security and border protection.
“We do not want a Europe that redistributes clandestine migrants,” Salvini said. “We want a Europe that does not let them in.” His plan includes bolstering the E.U.’s border control arm called Frontex with 10,000 armed men ready to protect Europe's borders at any cost. Currently, Frontex only conducts air surveillance activities after discontinuing the Sophia program that served as search and rescue. Under the new program, Frontex would act as a defense army on the sea to stop migrants from crossing into Italy, Greece and Spain.
Like Trump in the United States, Salvini constantly refers to migrants trying to enter as terrorists and rapists. When migrants are rescued at sea, he often offers to take the women and children to Italy and then chides them for not accepting if it means leaving their adolescent sons or husbands on board.
He also wants to end definitively any chance of Turkey, which is in the initial stages of E.U. membership vetting, entering the bloc. “Turkey is not in Europe and it never will be,” he said, underscoring that the stance is a non-negotiable tenet of the far-right program. “The accession process should be cancelled. It should be definitively stopped.”
The far-right group also thrives on national identity, a term used several times during the launch. “We will defend ‘made in Europe’,” Salvini said. “But we want to celebrate ‘made in Italy,’ ‘made in Deutschland,’ and ‘made in Austria’ more.” The definition goes on to embrace national heritage, language and cultures. The E.U. is not a melting pot in the eyes of these leaders. It is a very separate union of diverse people.
“The only way to do is through embracing the national state and staying focused,” said Vistisen. “If we let our opposition divide us, we will see more of Europe and more Brussels in all we do.”
Salvini was even more precise. “We are not aiming to lose or just participate in these elections,” he said. “Our goal is to win and change the rules of Europe.”"
"Fresh Off the 2016 Debacle, Facebook Backs Away From the 2020 Election Debates",www.thedailybeast.com,Maxwell.Tani@thedailybeast.com (Maxwell Tani),04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/facebook-and-the-2020-election-the-tech-giant-backs-away-from-democratic-debates,"STRATEGIC RESTRAINT Fresh Off the 2016 Debacle, Facebook Backs Away From the 2020 Election Debates The tech giant has had a politically difficult year and a half—and the current inclination is to lay a bit low. 04.09.19 4:45 AM ET Chip Somodevilla/Getty
Facebook once wanted Americans to associate its platform with presidential elections. Now the company doesn’t seem so sure.
The social networking giant has been notably absent from the first big events of the 2020 presidential primary, a significant contrast from the strategy it employed just four years ago.
The distance appears deliberate, at least for now. According to several people involved with the planning debates for the Democratic primary, Facebook will not be a major participant in the first several events. Neither CNN or MSNBC are currently working with the company for the first debates, and sources at both networks said there are no current plans for a significant role for the platform either.
The DNC itself hasn’t written off digital media partnerships. Indeed, one Democratic source familiar with DNC planning told The Daily Beast the committee has been interested in working with YouTube for at least one debate. Another person familiar with the debate planning process said the DNC has received pitches to host debates from several digital media organizations, including NowThis. A BuzzFeed News source also confirmed to The Daily Beast that the news organization was exploring partnering with Twitter on a Democratic primary debate.
But Facebook has not been a major part of those pitches. And the committee is facing pressure to keep the tech giant at a distance in light of the experience of the last election and growing interest within the party to crack down on Silicon Valley.
“If Facebook is trying to keep a lower profile around the Democratic debates that's probably smart since they've a new data breach every other week and an FTC investigation looming over them,” Eddie Vale, a partner at New Paradigm Strategy Group told The Daily Beast. “But no matter what [Mark] Zuckerberg decides to do, Democrats should be steering clear of their sponsorship entirely while they're continuing to allow foreign interference, misogyny, & hate to spread on their platform.”
Facebook and the DNC declined to discuss matters on the record. But another Democratic operative familiar with the DNC’s thinking said that partnering with Facebook was not a top priority for the committee as it approaches tech companies with much more caution this cycle.
“Generally, the DNC is super-suspicious of the big tech companies this time around, especially with Facebook,” the source said.
The more restrained approach that Facebook is taking to the debates, and the caution exhibited by the DNC, is the latest indication of how the relationship between the tech giant and the major political parties has grown complicated after the 2016 election.
Four years ago, Facebook was enthusiastic in its participation in the debates and major planned political events. The company was a co-sponsor of the first Fox News Republican debates, plastering the blue and white logo prominently on screen next to some of the candidates while they made their arguments. The hosts for the Facebook co-sponsored debates took questions viewers submitted to them over the social network, and during commercial breaks, a correspondent took Facebook Live viewers onto the stage to discuss the debate with the moderators.
Facebook partnered with CNN on another Republican debate as well as an election-themed road-trip leading up to the first Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Nevada. It also allowed CNN access to some of its user data during the 2016 election in order to allow the cable news network to pose more relevant questions during debates.
But its role in the 2016 election ultimately became defined not by its involvement in the debates but, rather, by its platform being hijacked by Russian actors to spread disinformation and by the harvesting of personal information by political entities, including a Trump-allied analytics group.
Though Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg initially dismissed criticism of the company’s conduct during the 2016 election, he has since acknowledged the need to take more proactive steps so that the platform isn’t used to undermine future elections.
That’s not been sufficient for many Democrats, who have grown critical of Facebook after Russia successfully pushed anti-Clinton memes, disinformation, and embarrassing hacked internal DNC emails on the platform during the 2016 election.
Though Facebook remains extremely valuable for digital outreach, and Democratic candidates continue to invest heavily in advertising over the medium in hopes of reaching voters and building their email lists, several Democratic 2020 presidential candidates have made criticizing tech platforms like Facebook a part of their pitch to primary voters. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has called for breaking up tech companies including Facebook. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) carved out a section of her 2020 presidential announcement speech to admonish the big tech companies.
“We need to put some digital rules into law when it comes to people’s privacy,” she said . “For too long the big tech companies have been telling you ‘Don’t worry, we’ve got your back’ while your identities are being stolen and your data is mined.”"
The Fur Industry Is Ready to Fight New York City’s Proposed Ban ‘Tooth and Nail’,www.thedailybeast.com,alaina.demopoulos@thedailybeast.com (Alaina Demopoulos),04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-fur-industry-is-ready-to-fight-new-york-citys-proposed-ban-tooth-and-nail,"The Fur Industry Is Ready to Fight New York City’s Proposed Ban ‘Tooth and Nail’ Photo Illustration by Kelly Caminero/The Daily Beast/Getty/Shutterstock NYC lawmakers have proposed a ban on the sale of fur, following the lead of Los Angeles and San Francisco. It could cost the city over 1,000 jobs and $3 million. Alaina Demopoulos 04.09.19 4:43 AM ET
T he fur coat, a symbol of unabashed glamour and wealth, is at the center of a rather ugly battle in New York City.
In March, Council Speaker Corey Johnson proposed a ban on the sale of fur in New York. This follows the lead of San Francisco and Los Angeles, where similar laws have been passed.
In a statement sent to The Daily Beast, Speaker Johnson wrote, “There is a growing movement in the fashion industry that believes that the use of fur is no longer ethical, and I agree with that assertion.”
“Some world famous designers are refraining from using fur in their collections, and I am sure some local designers are opting for the same choice. It is just cruel to kill an animal for the sole purpose of wearing a fur coat. Banning the sale of fur is the right thing to do.”
Indeed, many large fashion houses are ditching fur. Donatella Versace , head of the Italian label once well-known for its brightly-dyed pelts, told The Economist last year, “I don’t want to kill animals to make fashion. It doesn’t feel right.”
Lines like Donna Karan, Diane von Furstenberg, Gucci, Kate Spade, Maison Margiela, and Michael Kors have all pledged to go synthetic in the past year.
Marc Jacobs went conspicuously faux in 2018, after animal rights protesters gathered outside his fall fashion show. (Jacobs swore to WWD the move “wasn’t a political statement.”)
Even the obviously named accessories brand Furla has pivoted to alternative fabrics.
Since launching her line in 2001, Stella McCartney has never used fur in any collection. On April 4th, the British designer won an appeal to trademark the term “Fur-Free Fur,” a phrase used on the tags of her imitation styles, which are made from acrylic, polyester, wool, or mohair.
PETA’s senior vice president Dan Mathews, who met with Speaker Johnson to discuss the fur ban, told The Daily Beast that the animal rights organization will hold training in New York later this month to teach members how to lobby their council members.
PETA representatives will also take leghold traps to City Hall to show council members “the real violence that animals endure in the fur industry.” “ This is New York, one of the cradles of civilization, and there is nothing civilized about electrocuting and skinning animals just for a frivolous fashion item that has already fallen from favor. ”
Though New York has long been known for its mink-clad socialites (many of whom still proudly parade their Dennis Basso coats around the Upper East Side), Mathews believes it is time the East Coast follows California’s lead.
“This is New York, one of the cradles of civilization, and there is nothing civilized about electrocuting and skinning animals just for a frivolous fashion item that has already fallen from favor,” he said.
Fallen from favor for PETA’s target demographic, maybe, but definitely not for all buyers. Industry studies suggest that demand is rising in recent years.
While millennials may not be running to cop a full-length rabbit coat, there is no denying the popularity of fur trim. Google Trends reports that searches for “Canada Goose jacket” and “Women’s coat with fur hood” are up more than 80 percent. New York, Washington, DC, and New Jersey lead the states that search such terms the most.
In the New York neighborhood of Chelsea, where the fur industry is based, an average one bedroom rents for $3,700 and a cup of pour over coffee costs $4 with tax. The always-rising cost of living has displaced family-run fur shops, some of which have existed for four or five generations.
Furriers see the proposed ban as yet another attack on their livelihoods. “How do you take a business that has been around for hundreds of years and decide you want to end it?” said Marc Kaufman, a fifth-generation shop owner. “It’s beyond the fur business. Next is cashmere, goose down, suede shoes, leather shoes. Once they’re done with us, they’re going to go to the next prize.”
Larry Cowit, vice president of Madison Avenue Furs, also asked “What’s next?”
“Do we close Peter Luger’s [Steakhouse]? It’s been there 100 years. Do we close every Canada Goose store in the city? There has to be a line, or we’re all going to eat tofu and walk around in plastic sandals. Where does it end?” “ Fur is just a luxury adornment of a bygone era—it’s not something people need to keep warm. ”
When asked why ban fur as opposed to leather or suede, Mathews said, “You have got to start somewhere. Fur is just a luxury adornment of a bygone era—it’s not something people need to keep warm.”
Miguel Inclan runs Dimitrios Furs, which was founded by Greek immigrants in 1937. Like many of the stores on 30th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenue, multiple posters that read “Save NY Jobs!” line the front window.
“A fur ban would kill us,” Inclan said. “We make our living through this, put our kids through college. This is the only thing we have been doing forever.”
All of the furriers who spoke with The Daily Beast believe that the ban is rooted in more than just ethics. “Everything is political,” Inclan said. “This could be about real estate. The rent in the area is so high, you have no idea.” “ We went through this in the ’80s and late ’90s, and now we’re going through it again. The public has to realize that you’re talking about taking away people’s rights. ”
During a furrier protest on City Hall last month, WLNY reported that more than 1,100 people work in the industry, so a ban would cost New York $3.3 billion in revenue over the next decade.
“We are fighting tooth and nail,” Cowit said. “We went through this in the ’80s and late ’90s, and now we’re going through it again. The public has to realize that you’re talking about taking away people’s rights.”
Representatives for Speaker Johnson, whose constituency includes the fur district, declined The Daily Beast’s request for an interview. The Speaker told WLNY, “I never want to see jobs lost or businesses close, but this is the right thing to do.”
Mathews, the PETA vice president, put it more bluntly: “Smart furriers have diversified,” he said. “If you go into a lot of shops that sell furs, they sell other things, too.” He also noted that, “People who made cigarettes said the same thing [about losing jobs], despite the fact that smoking is such a leading cause of death in this country.”
Though Mathews claimed that PETA reps have met with “loads of furriers over the years,” the organization has no plans to speak to those impacted by the ban. As he put it, “I don’t see the point of PETA having those conversations.”
Of course, a ban on the sale of fur in just one city will not crush the entire international industry. In fact, during a recent afternoon at Madison Avenue Furs, one shopper was a woman who lives in L.A.
Since the sale of mink is prohibited in her hometown, she made a point of stopping by New York's fur district to pick something up where it's legal—for now."
Mayor Pete & Chasten Buttigieg Are Courting LGBT Voters Like No Other 2020 Candidates Can,www.thedailybeast.com,Scott.Bixby@thedailybeast.com (Scott Bixby),04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/mayor-pete-and-chasten-buttigieg-are-courting-lgbt-voters-like-no-other-2020-candidates-can,"POWER COUPLE How Mayor Pete and Chasten Buttigieg Are Working to Lock up the LGBT Vote Alongside husband Chasten, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is working to lock up LGBT votes in a way no other Democratic candidate is able to. 04.09.19 4:43 AM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photo by Getty
WASHINGTON, D.C.—One week before he is expected to formally announce his not-so-long-shot candidacy for the White House, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is leaning into his personal connection to a devoted Democratic constituency for whom politics has always been a fight against the odds: LGBT voters.
As a voting bloc with strong ties to the Democratic Party and with a vast network of well-funded political organizations battle-tested in the nationwide war over same-sex marriage, LGBT voters are a prize target for any Democrat seeking the party’s nomination. But Buttigieg’s historic status as the first out Democratic presidential candidate gives added power to his campaign’s pursuit of LGBT votes and donor dollars. Alongside husband Chasten, the most public-facing political spouse in the field, Buttigieg is courting those supporters in a way no other Democratic candidate can.
“Everybody’s on their own journey—your journey belongs to you,” Buttigieg told reporters after a keynote address at the LGBTQ Victory Fund’s national brunch on Sunday afternoon. “But hopefully my journey is an indication that however much you’re struggling, somebody who’s been through a certain kind of that struggle myself has been able to step forward as a credible candidate for the highest office in the land.”
Buttigieg is often the first to point out that as a Harvard graduate, Rhodes scholar and Afghanistan veteran, his life experience as a gay man is far from representative, but he still hopes that queer kids can still see a part of themselves in his story, and in his family.
“I hope in seeing that representation, they take strength and comfort and courage,” Buttigieg said.
As Buttigieg focuses on his broader message of generational justice—reliable stump speech staples about climate change and economic equality made appearances in the address as well—the campaign has found an effective stand-in for LGBT supporters: Chasten, who told reporters that he’s much more comfortable discussing “dogs, ice cream, and the weather” than discussing politics or policy.
Chasten, a junior high school teacher and one of the last people having a good time on Twitter , was swamped by well-wishers, admirers and selfie-seekers at the Victory Fund’s pre-brunch VIP cocktail hour. For a political spouse to feature so prominently so early in a presidential campaign is practically unheard of, and Chasten’s rising profile is evidence that Buttigieg’s team sees him as a potent surrogate—particularly with LGBT voters, who have never seen a potential presidential family that looked like their own.
On Saturday night, Chasten (pronounced CHASS-ten) told a packed house at a Human Rights Campaign dinner in Houston about moving out of his family home after coming out to his parents as a teenager—an issue that hits close to home for many LGBT Americans.
“We have a great relationship now, but back then, things weren’t easy,” Chasten said. “Eventually, I thought, ‘I can’t be here anymore,’ and so I moved out without a plan. I was scared, living between my car and friends’ couches.”
Speaking to reporters before the brunch on Sunday, Chasten said that, as a former theater kid, speaking about such a personal story in such a public forum comes naturally to him, and is, in fact, easier than the policy his wonkish husband prefers.
“I’m just really happy to go out there and spread our message,” Chasten said. “I think it’s a really good message, and it means a lot to me that people are moved by the message, so “if all it takes is showing up and taking a selfie to make people feel seen and feel good about who they are and how they fit into the world, then I’ll fly to Houston and do that, you know?” he said.
Sharing the story of his marriage to Buttigieg has often meant that actual marriage has taken a new shape, Chasten said.
“At the end of the day, we barely talk to one another, so, it’s like, we just follow it on social media. ‘Oh, it looked like you had a busy day,’” Chasten said, accidentally describing the essence of a lot of modern relationships. Even the mayor didn’t get a chance to see his husband’s inaugural solo speech until the next day, when Chasten sent him the video.
“He said he was really moved—he got a little emotional,” Chasten said. “I really wanted to be authentic in my own skin, you know, tell my own story. Obviously I wasn’t going to go in there swinging policy, because I’m not a politician. I just wanted to be my authentic self and tell my story.”
For voters like those who gathered to celebrate a record “rainbow wave” of LGBT political candidates—less than five years removed from victory in the fight for same-sex marriage, and fighting the Trump administration’s policies on transgender rights to this day —witnessing a same-sex couple run for president as a team was a powerful sight, a magic that no other presidential campaign can replicate.
Speaking before a ballroom full of donors to the nation’s largest political action committee dedicated to electing LGBT candidates to office, however, the openly gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana drew standing ovations and quiet tears from the audience with a deeply personal speech about his journey towards self-acceptance. Although Buttigieg, a veteran of Afghanistan , has often likened struggling with his sexuality to waging a war within himself, his Victory Fund address framed that war in even more brutally personal terms.
“There were times in my life when if you had shown me exactly what it was inside me that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife,” Buttigieg said. But if he had, as “so many young people struggling to come to terms with the sexuality or their gender identity do,” figuratively or literally, he said, he never would have met his husband.
Framing his personal journey as integral to becoming a better public servant, as well as a better person—as well as the occasional callout of Vice President Mike Pence —resonated with the audience to a rare degree. When Buttigieg noted that if he had been able to “cure” himself of his sexuality, “the best thing in my life, my marriage, might not have happened at all,” numerous same-sex couples in the room wordlessly reached out to their significant others.
“Thank God there was no pill,” Buttigieg said. “Thank God there was no knife.”
Like President Barack Obama’s outreach to black voters in 2008 and Hillary Clinton’s appeals to women in 2016, Buttigieg’s campaign will seek to balance his ability inspire a powerful group of potential supporters as a gay candidate with the risk of being seen as the gay candidate . But Buttigieg told reporters that embracing a group identity and embracing broader policy issues doesn’t have to be an either/or proposition
“I really believe Americans today—most Americans today—will evaluate you based on what you have to offer, what kind of results you bring, what kind of experience that you bring,” Buttigieg told reporters, after being asked how his status as the first out gay man to win a spot on a presidential debate stage could expand, or limit, his appeal to voters. “I believe that positions us very well, and I’m looking forward to giving Americans a chance to take me seriously.”"
Kris Kobach Auditions for DHS Job on Fox: Detain Children ‘As Long As Necessary’,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kris-kobach-auditions-for-dhs-job-on-fox-detain-children-as-long-as-necessary,"‘IMMIGRATION CZAR’ Kris Kobach Auditions for DHS Job on Fox: Detain Children ‘As Long As Necessary’ As part of a three-part plan, he stated he would create a regulation making it legal to detain children “as long as necessary.” Justin Baragona 04.08.19 11:13 PM ET
A day after Kirstjen Nielsen’s abrupt departure as Homeland Security secretary, former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach essentially auditioned for her old job by showing up on one of President Trump’s favorite cable news programs for an interview.
During Monday night’s appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Kobach—who previously vice-chaired Trump’s now-shuttered voter fraud commission —began the interview by telling host Tucker Carlson that the Department of Homeland Security has been the “biggest impediment” to enacting the president’s immigration policies.
“Leadership for the past two years has been unwilling to execute many of the president’s plans,” Kobach declared. “From direct personal experience, I have been in the room when the president has given express orders to leadership at DHS and been assured those orders will be carried out. Then a year later nothing has happened.”
After Kobach was done throwing Nielsen under the bus, Carlson asked the one-time Kansas gubernatorial candidate what he would do first if he were “running DHS tomorrow.”
Kobach detailed a three-part plan he unveiled last week during an appearance on Fox Business Network’s Lou Dobbs Tonight , another of Trump’s favorite programs . Stating that he would create a regulation making it legal to detain children “as long as necessary,” Kobach moved on to the second part of his proposal—placing entire migrant families in camps for processing.
“I would deploy the thousands of FEMA trailers, either to border cities or to military bases in Texas and Arizona and set up processing centers,” the Republican politician asserted. “Instead of just turning loose these bogus asylum applicants on to the American streets never to be seen again.”
“Let's put them in mobile homes, lets process their claims, ship the immigration judges in, have the claims processed right there, and as soon as their claim is denied, put them on a passenger plane and fly them right back home. Word will get out it in the villages back home, ‘Hey it doesn't work to get in these caravans anymore, you're not going to be released into the United States.’”
Kobach went on to explain the third portion of his plan would consist of threatening Mexico with a regulation that would prevent immigrants from sending wire remittances from the United States to Mexico.
“That regulation is going to take effect and become final unless you sign the third country, safe third country agreement like we have with Canada so that any asylum applicant, the first safe country they step foot in, namely Mexico, they have to apply there for asylum,” Kobach added.
The right-wing news site Breitbart, meanwhile, has recently begun selling Kobach as a possible “immigration czar” for the Trump administration. Kobach just so happens to write for Breitbart. READ THIS LIST"
Forget Kirstjen Nielsen—Her Replacement Actually Separated Families,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Glawe,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/forget-kirstjen-nielsen-new-dhs-secretary-kevin-mcaleenan-actually-separated-families,"SOME ‘MODERATE’ New DHS Boss Is the Guy Who Led Family Separations Trump wanted someone ‘tough’ to handle the border. Kevin McAleenan’s agents were the ones who took kids from parents. He even helped come up with the idea. 04.08.19 11:10 PM ET Sergio Flores/The Washington Post via Getty
Kirstjen Nielsen will go down in infamy for claiming the Trump administration did not “create a policy of separating families at the border,” but the man taking her job as homeland security secretary actually implemented the policy and it was his agents who did the separating.
Kevin McAleenan was the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection until Monday, when he was named acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security after President Trump sacked Nielsen because he reportedly thought she wasn’t tough enough on the southern border. But McAleenan has been plenty tough on the border, with his agents apprehending thousands of migrants for criminal prosecution and turning away thousands more asylum seekers.
Yet he is being portrayed by some as a relative moderate , with many noting his service as deputy CBP commissioner during the Obama administration, which increased deportations and hardened immigration policy. McAleenan served admirably enough for President Obama to grant him an award because he achieved “ extraordinary results ” in his position.
“The fact that you served under Obama certainly doesn’t absolve you from any possibility of being a hard-right immigration enforcer,” said Matthew Kolken, an immigration attorney and frequent critic of both the Obama and Trump administrations’ immigration policies.
In April 2018, McAleenan co-authored a memo to Nielsen stating that DHS could “direct the separation of parents or legal guardians and minors held in immigration detention so that the parent or legal guardian can be prosecuted... ” The memo laid out several options for Nielsen to choose so DHS could help prosecute every unauthorized border crossing under the abandoned “zero tolerance” policy. Nielsen evidently chose the option that included widespread separation and signed her name to the memo.
Soon afterward, CBP was separating migrant parents from their children. More than 2,500 families were separated before the program was halted a year ago—and not all have been reunited.
In McAllen, Texas, CBP agents prevented parents from being reunited with their children, according to the DHS Office of Inspector General.
“CBP may have been able to avoid separating some families,” a 2018 OIG report states . “However, CBP officials later arranged to have adults transferred directly from court to ICE custody, rather than readmitting them where they might be reunited with their children. According to a senior official who was involved with this decision, CBP made this change in order to avoid doing the additional paperwork required to readmit the adults.”
Around the same time, CBP began turning away asylum seekers.
Agents stood at the dividing line between the U.S. and Mexico, preventing migrants from entering American territory where they are legally allowed to claim asylum, according to the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin’s Strauss Center . Agents allegedly told them there was “no room” or that the U.S. wasn’t currently accepting asylum claims at that time (a blatant lie), according to UT-Austin.
More recently,McAleenan’s agents have been implementing the administration’s policy of sending asylum seekers back to Mexico to await their day in court, a policy known as “Remain in Mexico.” On Monday, a federal judge in San Francisco put a temporary stop to the policy , noting that the practice directly contradicts the “government’s acknowledged obligation to ensure aliens are not returned to unduly dangerous circumstances.”
It has been McAleenan’s CBP agents who have been sending migrants back to those “dangerous circumstances,” either in violent Mexican border towns like Tijuana and Juarez via Remain in Mexico.
It’s unclear whether Trump will nominate McAleenan to serve as permanent Homeland Security secretary as the White House “purges” the department. Meanwhile, immigrant advocates and attorneys are waiting to see what happens next.

Ever since reports surfaced that DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was canned by President Trump, there’s been a spate of reputation-smoothing articles (probable source: Nielsen’s camp) alleging that the woman who presided over the separation of families and caging of children at the border was canned because she’d prevented the president and his xenophobic consigliere, Stephen Miller, from instituting even harsher immigration policies.
Stephen Colbert, like many who’ve actually listened to Nielsen over the course of her tenure, wasn’t buying the lame stab at image rehab. “Last night, Nielsen resigned as Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary,” the Late Show host announced to loud cheers from his New York audience. “I believe she’s leaving to spend more time separating her family.”
“Now, even though Nielsen officially wasn’t ‘fired,’ reportedly she ‘did not resign willingly.’ Not fired, but not… that sounds like splitting hairs. No, Sarah did not dump me , she begged me to dump her !’” joked Colbert. “Nielsen’s departure is not a total shock. Reportedly for weeks, Nielsen has felt ‘in limbo’—‘limbo’ is the right word here, because we’ve all been watching just how low she can go.”
The late-night comedian then went over news reports claiming that Trump told aides he wanted to fire Nielsen last fall because she wasn’t tough enough on “the caravan.”
“Sure, she puts kids in cages, but Trump was upset because Nielsen hasn’t enacted stricter immigration rules,” Colbert explained. “So, he just needs someone who can be crueler to children then Kirstjen Nielsen. Get ready for Secretary of Homeland Security Pennywise—and of course, she will be taking his place”—he added, before throwing to an image of Nielsen beckoning children from the sewer.
If that weren’t enough, Colbert aired a parody commercial for Hallmark’s new “Kirstjen Nielsen Farewell Card Collectjion” where you can look “for the perfect way to say goodbye to Kirstjen Nielsen” with greeting cards that read, “I’m Not Crying Because You’re Leaving… I’m Crying Because You Shot Tear Gas At Me As I Was Seeking Asylum” and “Don’t Think Of This As ‘Goodbye,’ Think Of It As See You Later… At The War Crimes Tribunal.”"

Dem Groups Want to Make Kirstjen Nielsen a Post-Trump Pariah,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kirstjen-nielsen-progressive-groups-promise-to-haunt-trumps-dhs-secretary-even-after-she-leaves-the-administration,"WE'RE NOT FINISHED Dem Groups Want to Make Kirstjen Nielsen a Post-Trump Pariah A coalition of groups have made clear that her hiring at major corporations or media networks would be unacceptable. 04.08.19 8:31 PM ET Alex Wong
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen may have been pushed out of her job by the president over the weekend. But a coalition of progressive groups now want to ensure that she finds no comfy landing in her career after Trump.
The groups are readying a plan to shame any major news networks or large corporation that hires the soon-to-be former DHS Secretary, contending that her involvement in the Trump administration’s family separation policy inherently disqualifies her from a plum gig in the private sector.
“If a corporation or university or speaking agency is going to bring her on board, there will be a significant reputational risk associated with that decision,” Karl Frisch, a spokesperson for the liberal advocacy group Restore Public Trust told The Daily Beast. “Ultimately her great moral failing irreparably harmed and traumatized thousands of families seeking help in the United States. She facilitated that, she helped plan it, she helped execute it and she defended it.”
The decision to go after Nielsen—as well as other administration officials—even after her tenure has ended shows not only how detested a figure she became among progressives, but also the degree to which political advocacy now includes campaigns to influence private sector behavior. Nielsen knows this all too well. In June 2018, she was jeered by protesters as she ate at a Washington, D.C.-based Mexican restaurant.
Prior to Nielsen’s resignation, Restore Public Trust and nearly 40 immigration and progressive advocacy groups had formed a coalition to implore corporate leaders to avoid hiring a slew of Trump officials involved in implementing the family separation policy including Nielsen, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. Over the weekend, the group sent a letter to Fortune 500 CEOs listing all the names of the individuals they hoped would be blacklisted from hiring. That was followed by an ad bearing a similar message in The New York Times on Sunday, featuring a red Make America Great Again hat with the words “Put Kids In Cages.”
“Any senior administration official who leaves and thinks that they can cash in after being a part of this horrific policy has another thing coming in,” Frisch said. “We are sounding the alarm now.”
The coalition hopes that by drawing continued attention to the family separation policy and those who helped implement it, they can mobilize employees of corporations and potentially major news networks to refuse to hire those individuals most closely associated with the policy.
It’s a strategy born from the realization that even those government officials associated with deeply controversial policies often get plum gigs once they enter the private sector. It’s also an idea that is built on some past successes. Last summer, employees of Salesforce wrote a letter to the company’s CEO Marc Benioff urging him to reconsider company ties with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He declined to do so but said that their technology was not being used for family separation.
There was a similar outcry when Sarah Isgur , the former top communications aide for Sessions, was hired as a politics editor at CNN. That led to assurances from the network that she would have no involvement in actual politics coverage, town halls with Democratic presidential candidates, or the debate CNN is hosting this summer. Isgur ultimately said that she would be taking a role as political analyst instead.
Media monitors like Sleeping Giants, who led campaigns against advertisers on Tucker Carlson’s primetime Fox News show, are also keeping a close watch on Nielsen’s possible media bookings or potential signings as a contributor. The organization told The Daily Beast that they will observe the unfolding situation and develop an official plan should more news develop. And American Oversight, a progressive investigative organization, said it would continue its research into Nielsen’s role in the president’s family separation policy even though she was no longer part of the administration.
While some groups will remain focused on Nielsen even as she leaves the public sector, other organizations said their efforts will shift to the remainder of DHS and the nominee to replace her. An official with CREDO, a mobile advocacy group, said it was poised to launch an aggressive pushback on the person chosen to fill Nielsen’s role, should the president choose someone from the list of names he’s rumored to be considering.
“The names being floated so far are troubling -- the next person to take this job needs to unequivocally denounce Trump's family separation policy,” Josh Nelson, co-director of CREDO told The Daily Beast.
That has also been an early stipulation of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, many of whom had called for Nielsen’s resignation before this weekend.
“I will not support a nominee who does not forcefully and unequivocally denounce this administration’s policy of separating families at the border,” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) said on Monday. “The next Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security must be committed to reuniting families and protecting the human rights of those seeking asylum. Cruelty is not a substitute for a smart, lawful, and humane immigration policy. The American people deserve better.” READ THIS LIST"

Bill Barr: I’m Not Giving Congress Unredacted Mueller Report,www.thedailybeast.com,Erin.Banco@thedailybeast.com (Erin Banco),04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/attorney-general-bill-barr-im-not-giving-congress-unredacted-mueller-report,"GO TIME Bill Barr: I’m Not Giving Congress Full Mueller Report The AG said a redacted version could come within a week. But he’s not giving in to congressional demands for the whole copy. 04.09.19 10:43 AM ET Saul Loeb/Getty
Attorney General Bill Barr said Tuesday that he would be in position to release the special counsel’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election within the week but that portions of it would be redacted in order to protect ongoing investigations and the privacy and reputation of individuals who have not been charged.
Setting up a potentially contentious showdown with lawmakers, Barr added that he had no plans to release a full, unredacted report to Congress, despite their demands for one.
“I don’t intend at this stage to send the full unredacted report to the [judiciary] committee,” Barr said. He also said that he would not seek a court order to release grand jury information despite demands by judiciary chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) for such information to be provided.
The attorney general answered questions about the Mueller report in a hearing in front of the House Appropriations Committee on the Department of Justice’s 2020 budget. Barr said that his team, along with members of the special counsel’s office, was still in the midst of redacting the report, including material related to grand jury testimonies. When released, the report will be color coded to show why each redacted section was being withheld from public viewing, Barr said.
Members of the committee, including the chair, Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY), pressed Barr on the process he used to write his four-page summary of the report. Barr said that the attorney general’s office consulted with members of the special counsel’s office in the weeks leading up to its submission of the report. He also said that he had offered Mueller a chance to review his summary of Mueller’s findings but that Mueller declined the offer. Since Barr released his four-page memo, it has been reported that investigators in the special counsel’s office felt that the report was more damaging to President Trump than Barr reflected in his summary.
Barr’s summary said that the special counsel’s office “did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.” It went on to say that the special counsel’s office stated in its report that “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”
Should Barr follow through on his timeline of releasing the redacted version, the report could very well be released next week, when Congress is out on recess.
President Donald Trump had initially said that he would welcome the full release of the Mueller report. But in recent days he has taken to Twitter to insist that Democrats would not be satisfied even were a full release of the report to happen, and hinting at his own reservations about some of the report’s details being made public.
Lowey asked Barr if he had consulted with the White House before releasing his summary. Barr declined to answer.
“I’ve said what I’m going to say about the report today,” he said, adding that he was prepared to testify in front of Congress about the report in May.
Rep. Charlie Crist (D-FL) asked Barr if he let anyone outside of the Department of Justice read his March 24 letter to Congress summarizing Mueller’s work.
“The answer, I am pretty sure, is no,” Barr said.
“You’re not sure?” Crist asked.
“I am sure,” Barr said.
Later, Barr clarified that before the letter went out to Congress, the attorney general’s office told the White House counsel that the summary was sent out.
“I think it may have been read to them,” Barr said, adding that he did not think that the White House actually saw the letter or that saying he doesn’t believe they saw the letter and didn’t get chance to change it."
"Israeli President Rebukes Bibi, Signs Controversial ‘Nation-State' Law in Arabic",www.thedailybeast.com,Noga Tarnopolsky,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/netanyahu-denigrates-arabs-to-try-to-win-re-election-but-israeli-president-rivlin-signs-the-controversial-nation-state-law-in-arabic,"exclusive Photo Illustration by Kelly Caminero/The Daily Beast/Getty
JERUSALEM–There it is, in perfect Arabic calligraphy: “Reuven Rivlin,” name of the President of the State of Israel, and beneath that, as is Rivlin’s habit, also in handwriting, the Hebrew word “Jerusalem.”
For months, Israel has been rife with rumors about Rivlin’s intention to sign the Nation-State Law, a controversial measure derogating the official status of the Arabic language in Israel and elevating the status of Jewish-only communities.
Dr. Thabet Abu Rass, an old friend of the president, told The Daily Beast that in a meeting last July, less than two weeks after the measure passed Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, he asked Rivlin,
“Will you sign a law like that?”
Rivlin had been so perturbed about the possibility of the law’s passage that on July 10 he had taken the unprecedented step of sending a letter to the Knesset’s Law and Constitution Committee, warning that the bill could “support discrimination and exclusion of men and women based on their ethnic origin.”
The Israeli presidency is a largely symbolic post. Presidents almost never speak out on matters under parliamentary debate.
But after a close election, the president becomes, if only for a day, the most important man in Israel.
Last month, as Israel approached the end of a campaign full of incitement and hurled smears, in which Netanyahu continually warned Israelis that his opponent, former army chief of staff Benny Gantz, will ally with “the Arabs,” Rivlin appeared to lose patience.
Without uttering Netanyahu’s name, Rivlin denounced “entirely unacceptable remarks about the Arab citizens of Israel.”
“There are no, and there will be no, second-class citizens, and there are no second-class voters,” Rivlin said at a Jerusalem conference marking 40 years since the signing of Israeli-Egyptian peace. “We are all equal in the voting booth. Jews and Arabs, citizens of the State of Israel.”
The president is tasked with choosing who will form Israel's next government.
“You know the meaning of the president not signing a law?” Rivlin answered Abu Rass.
“I’d have to resign. But I promise you that when the law comes to my desk and I have to sign it, I’ll sign it in Arabic, and that says everything.”
The president’s historic act is being reported here for the first time.
Rivlin's signature is not a small, local story. His deed, as president of Israel, is arguably as significant as New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinta Ardern's decision to wear a head scarf when she comforted Muslim mourners after the mosque attacks.
Rivlin, the scion of one of Jerusalem’s most renowned families, is no left-winger.
In fact, years before Netanyahu’s Hail Mary promise of annexation of the West Bank to Israel, Rivlin was championing a one-state vision of the Greater Land of Israel.
But in ways large and small, he has made equality and the defense of Arabs and Islamic culture his signature issue.
When Rivlin, a veteran legislator, was elected Speaker of the Knesset in March 1999, he chose to make his first official visit to the Arab-Israeli town of Umm al-Fahm, in the southern Galilee.
In January 2015, when addressing the United Nations General Assembly ceremony marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day, Rivlin said that “neither the West, nor the Christians nor the Jews are at war with Islam.”
“Right now,” he said, “Islam encompasses, under its enormous wings, victims of persecution and of terrorism, while at the same time it also serves as the banner of the attackers.”
When George Amira, an 11-year-old Tel Aviv schoolboy, posted a video about the ways he was being bullied in school, Rivlin invited him to the Presidential Residence in Jerusalem to film a response clip showing up his tormentors.
It was no surprise that Rivlin opposed the Nation-State law, but it is a remarkable coincidence that Netanyahu and Rivlin, Israel’s Trump and McCain, find themselves serving as prime minister and president today.
The two grew up as university brats in the same cauldron of Jerusalem's revisionist Likud youth, Netanyahu, 69, the son of a man who viewed Arabs as uncultured natives and Rivlin, 79, the son of one of the Middle East's greatest scholars of Islamic culture.
Rivlin’s father, Professor Yosef Yoel Rivlin, a devoted Arabist, taught several generations of scholars at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem’s Department of Oriental Studies, and translated the Quran and a 32-volume edition of One Thousand and One Nights from Arabic to Hebrew.
Though members of the same Likud party, the two men rarely see eye-to-eye, and represent opposing visions of Israel.
Brig. Gen. (ret) Amal Asad , who has led the massive social protests that erupted after passage of the Nation-State Law, said that, “From day one, President Rivlin has symbolized the real Israeli, the ultimate Israeli for whom love of the country and its people--all its people--are his lodestar. I’ve known him for years. He is a man who unified people, without regard to color, fath, or orientation.”
And whereas few Israelis have affection for Netanyahu--even his supporters view him with a certain prideful dread--Rivlin is a deeply beloved figure across the board.
Informed of Rivlin’s signature, Moshe Shahal, a former minister of police and great man of the rival Labor Party, who served for decades alongside Rivlin, said, “He stands out as a man who represents respect among citizens and the rule of law. I am not surprised.”
The Likud is flooding Israelis with election-day warnings that, “President Rivlin will ask the party with the most votes to form the next government and Israel needs that to be Likud and Netanyahu--don’t be fooled by the media into thinking Likud and Netanyahu don’t need your help!”
Dan Meridor, a former minister of justice who grew up in the same Jerusalem environment as Netanyahu and Rivlin and has known the president for most of his 71 years, refused to speak of his old friend except to say, “He will perform his duties to the absolute letter of the law. Of that I have no doubt.”
Today’s election turns on a question of two very different conceptions of the character of the State of Israel."

Actress Lori Loughlin and more than a dozen other parents have been indicted on fraud and money laundering charges by a federal grand jury for their alleged roles in the massive college admission scandal, federal prosecutors said on Tuesday.
The 16 parents were charged in a second superseding indictment on Tuesday with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, honest services mail and wire fraud, and a new count of conspiracy to commit money laundering in what authorities have called the “largest college admissions scam prosecuted by the Justice Department.”
The new charges alleged that the parents knowingly laundered the bribes through “Singer’s purported charity and his for-profit corporation as well as by transferring money into the United States, from outside the United States, for the purpose of promoting the fraud scheme.”
The additional charges come just one day after Loughlin’s fellow actress Felicity Huffman and a dozen other parents agreed to plead guilty to bribery and fraud related to the scandal.
“I am in full acceptance of my guilt and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions,” Huffman said in a Monday statement , admitting she paid $15,000 for have her daughter’s SAT scores doctored. “I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college.”
Nearly 50 parents were charged last month after allegedly paying admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer, 58, more than $25 million total to rig test scores, cheat on SAT exams, and bribe college coaches, with the goal of getting their children into elite universities, including the University of Southern California, Georgetown, Stanford, and Yale.
Singer, the alleged mastermind, pleaded guilty in Boston court last month to charges including racketeering, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice.
Loughlin, the 54-year-old actress best known for playing Aunt Becky on Full House , and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, allegedly paid Singer nearly $500,000 to get their two daughters admitted to USC as crew recruits, even though neither teen had previously rowed crew. The payment was made out to Key Worldwide Foundation, a non-profit organization run by Singer.
“I have some concerns and want to fully understand that game plan to make sure we have a roadmap for success as it relates to [our older daughter] and getting her into a school other than ASU!” Giannulli allegedly wrote in an email to Singer, according to Tuesday’s indictment that added a money-laundering charge.
Prosecutors alleged that, in November 2018, Singer called Loughlin to warn her and her husband that his non-profit was being audited by the IRS, and that their two payments were being questioned.
“So I just want to make sure that you know that, one, that you’re probably going to get a call and that I have not told them anything about the girls going through the side door, through crew, even though they didn’t do crew to get into USC,” Singer told Loughlin, according to the indictment . “So I—that is—all I told them was that you guys made a donation to our foundation to help underserved kids.”
“Um-hmm,” Loughlin allegedly replied .
Both daughters, YouTube star Olivia Jade and Bella, have left the school since the scandal erupted, and several beauty brands have dropped the elder daughter from advertisement deals. The Hallmark Channel also cut ties with Loughlin .
In addition to the TV star, other parents hit with additional charges on Tuesday included Homayoun Zadeh, a former associate professor of dentistry at USC, who allegedly claimed his daughter was an elite lacrosse player; and Manuel Henriquez , who recently stepped down as head of a Bay Area hedge fund after being accused of hiring a proctor to sit with his daughter as she took the SAT test. Henriquez’s daughter, Isabelle, is one of the only students who willingly participated in the scheme that got her into Georgetown, according to the complaint."
Prison Is the Key to Felicity Huffman’s Future. Just Ask Martha Stewart.,www.thedailybeast.com,michael.daly@thedailybeast.com (Michael Daly),04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/college-admissions-scandal-felicity-huffmans-only-hope-is-prison-just-ask-martha-stewart,"opinion Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photos by Getty
Unless Felicity Huffman accepts the 4- to 10-month prison term recommended by the prosecutors, she faces a life sentence of scorn.
Wherever she goes, she will be a person of putrid privilege. She will have escaped punishment after paying $15,000 to give her daughter a dishonest edge at getting into college. And she will have done so at the expense of students who, in the words of the apology that accompanied her decision to plead guilty, “ work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly .”
Honest students and parents far, far outnumber the cheaters and she will be sure to encounter them at every turn. If she manages to stay out of prison, her apology will seem to have been just part of a successful effort to avoid consequences for her actions.
But if she does the four months, she will be somebody who did the time for her crime, however short that time may have been.
And everybody from People Magazine to CNN will no doubt be clamoring to interview her about the big lessons she learned in the big house. Just imagine her telling a talk show host about the moment she first found herself actually in a prison cell.
Witness what happened with Martha Stewart .
Back when Stewart was indicted for insider trading in 2003, she fell into instant disgrace, becoming a paragon not of taste, but of greed. Viacom dropped her show. Shares in her company fell. She was forced to step down as CEO.
Stewart was acquitted for insider trading, but found guilty of lying to federal investigators. She then went off to prison for five months and rehabbed herself.
Upon her release, Stewart was suddenly bigger than ever . She was interviewed by Matt Lauer and by Barbara Walters. Vanity Fair gushed, “Even before her first sip of coffee, Stewart is full of energy and shockingly forthright.” She appeared on the cover of Fortune with the headline:
Martha Stewart: From Prison to Prime Time: ‘I cannot be destroyed’
Stewart even lost 10 pounds behind bars with an exercise regimen that included doing crunches with a cellmate from Boston known as “Little Italy.”
The crafty ex-con now has a new deal with Aerosoles and a show with Snoop Dogg that prompted The New Yorker to suggest she is a “comedy genius.”
One person who understands the benefits that can come even with significant prison time for a celebrity is is radio shock jock Craig Carton, who was hit with 40 months last week for a scheme to pay off gambling debts with a multimillion-dollar scam involving concert tickets. He nonetheless reasoned aloud that he will come out and resume being “number one.”
“Going to prison, acknowledging what I’ve done wrong, taking full ownership of it… And being real about that, I think will have great credibility, especially with a male-dominated audience in New York,” he said on ESPN.
He went on, “I think we believe as a society in second chances. Things I’ll do publicly and privately I think you’ll buy into my changed ways.”
Huffman could accomplish much the same with as few as four months. She might not make the cover of Fortune , but she could get a big splash in People .
But if Huffman’s lawyers prevail and she gets off with no time, all that awaits her is scorn without parole. READ THIS LIST"

Racist and anti-Semitic YouTube users overwhelmed the official YouTube livestream of a House Judiciary Committee hearing on white nationalism on Tuesday, forcing YouTube to disable the ability to comment on the stream.
The posts, which attacked black and Jewish members of the committee and the hearing audience, were made even as a Google representative at the hearing claimed that “hate speech and violent extremism have no place on YouTube.”
Meanwhile, a white nationalist YouTube channel called “Red Ice TV” actually made money from the hearing. In exchange for getting their comments highlighted on the Red Ice stream of the House hearing, Red Ice commenters paid more than $100 to the channel through YouTube’s “Super Chat” function. Eventually, that comment feed was disabled as well.
A Google spokesperson confirmed that the company had disabled the comment stream on the House Judiciary hearing, although the spokesperson didn’t comment on whether Google had ended the Red Ice stream as well.
“Hate speech has no place on YouTube,” the spokesperson said in a statement.”We’ve invested heavily in teams and technology dedicated to removing hateful comments and videos and we take action on them when flagged by our users. Due to the presence of hateful comments, we disabled comments on the livestream of today’s House Judiciary Committee hearing.”
Anti-extremism activists have repeatedly criticized YouTube over how its recommendation algorithm pushes viewers towards extremist videos. On Tuesday, the company said it had changed the algorithm to prevent the promotion of “borderline” content that didn’t meet the guidelines for being deleted from YouTube.
Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), apparently told of the issue the company was having with its comment stream, acknowledged the deleted comment stream later in the hearing.
“This just illustrates the problem we’re dealing with,” Nadler said.
Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) cut in, asking Nadler whether the racist YouTube comments could be “another hate hoax.” READ THIS LIST"
"Israel Elections a Cliffhanger for Netanyahu, New Hope for His Opposition",www.thedailybeast.com,Noga Tarnopolsky,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/israel-elections-a-cliffhanger-for-netanyahu-new-hope-for-his-opposition,"NAIL BITER Israel Elections a Cliffhanger for Netanyahu, New Hope for His Opposition On Tuesday night the results were too close to call, with the possibility President Reuven Rivlin will have to choose between two equal blocs in the Knesset. Noga Tarnopolsky 04.09.19 4:55 PM ET
JERUSALEM–It will be a long night in Israel, where initial exit polls Tuesday evening indicated a close electoral victory for opposition head Benny Gantz, a former army chief of staff. But the prognosis for his chances to form a winning coalition block against right-wing parties led by the Likud Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has held office for 10 years, and dominated Israeli politics for a generation.
Both candidates declared immediate victory, though Gantz’s declaration, issued jointly with his deputy, former finance minister Yair Lapid, had a more exuberant tone.
“We won! The Israeli public has had their say!” the pair exulted in a statement. “Thank you to the thousands of activists and over a million voters. These elections have a clear winner and a clear loser. Netanyahu promised 40 seats and lost. The President [Reuven Rivlin] can see the picture and should call on the winner to form the next government. There is no other option!”
A few minutes later, in a Hebrew-language tweet, Netanyahu declared victory on behalf of his political wing, not himself or his party:
“The right-wing bloc led by the Likud won a clear victory. I thank the citizens of Israel for their trust. I will begin forming a right-wing government with our natural partners tonight.”
Netanyahu’s position was weakened by news that he faces indictments for corruption, and, to all appearances, by a brutal campaign in which he attacked Gantz, without basis, for allying with Arabs, for supposedly celebrating the “martyrdom” of Islamist militants killed in fighting with Israel and allegedly concealing an a sex-tape putatively hacked by Iran.
While Netanyahu ran a mudslinging blitzkrieg against his Israeli opponents he basked in the extraordinary support of both Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump.
Putin helped to return a long-lost Israeli casualty of the 1982 Lebanon War in a public ceremony with Netanyahu in Moscow just days before the vote. And Trump over the last year has gone far to meet Netanyahu’s most hardline diplomatic demands: moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, closing the consulate there which handled Palestinian affairs, then announcing in recent days his support for Israel’s claim to sovereignty over the Golan Heights, while declaring the entire Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps is a terrorist organization.
In truth, virtually all of Trump’s Middle East policy has been oriented toward, if not directed by, Netanyahu’s vision of the region, which often is coordinated with that of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (the suspected murderer of journalist Jamal Khashoggi).
In Israel on Tuesday night, the exit polls brought surprise figures showing a virtual dead heat between the two main political blocks in the raucous political arena. But figures are expected to shift as definitive results stream in overnight.Historically low turnout of under 70 percent appeared to be the one clear result of the bruising, incitement-filled campaign which was low on content or policy debates.
The mixed results–and potential loss for Netanyahu–was relayed in televised exit polls and at a massive rally planned for Tel Aviv, where Likud activists faced the unimaginable: the possible scenario of President Rivlin having to choose between two more or less equal voting blocks of 60 and 60.
In addition, a disengaged and disaffected Arab public, the brunt of constant attacks by Prime Minister Netanyahu, appeared reluctant to take part in the electoral process. Haaretz senior pollster Camil Fuchs, of Tel Aviv University, said that if the figures being reported from the Arab sector hold steady, historically low participation rates such could “completely change the Knesset map.”
Whichever man is chosen, the interim results indicate the Israeli populace may be thirsty for a change, and the country seems headed for a period of political instability.
Even if Netanyahu is called upon to form the next government, he is likely to face stiff opposition from within his own political camp when indicted late this summer. Netanyahu
If Gantz is chosen, the quiet general with no political experience may go down in history as a dragon-slayer.
While widely criticized for remaining a political cypher, the soft-spoken Gantz ran on two clear positions. He insisted that Netanyahu himself, with accusations of corruption trailing him, was the greatest danger facing Israel. This was the argument he used to explain the seemingly contradictory inclusion of right-wingers such as former Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon and left-leaning candidates such as Lapid. Gantz said it was a response to an “emergency”: Netanyahu.
Gantz also launched his campaign with the promise he’d change the controversial Nation-State Law, a measure Netanyahu claimed as his principal legislative achievement demoting Arabic from its status as an official language of the state and granting a special, elevated status to Jewish communities.
The law’s passage provoked the largest public protests Israel has seen in decades and prompted Rivlin to sign the measure in Arabic, an unprecedented act of protest by a sitting Israeli president.
Netanyahu, an experienced master of Israel’s parliamentary maneuvering, cannot be dismissed and may yet form Israel’s next government, but he will be a chastened giant, unlikely to escape the clutches of indictment and confronted by a robust, invigorated opposition in the Knesset.
Whatever results Israelis wake up to in the morning, King Bibi is no more.
At a Tel Aviv rally, Gantz, the old commander, thanked Netanyahu for his service and declared the dawning of a new day in Israel."

Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan: Fund Space Force As a Separate Military Branch or Risk Economic Apocalypse,www.thedailybeast.com,David Axe,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/secretary-of-defense-patrick-shanahan-fund-space-force-as-a-separate-military-branch-or-risk-war-and-economic-apocalypse,"SCARE TACTIC Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan: Fund Space Force as a Separate Military Branch or Risk Economic Apocalypse The Democratic-controlled Congress disagrees. 04.09.19 4:07 PM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/Getty
Trump administration officials trekked to a space-industry conference in Colorado Springs on Tuesday to deliver a thinly veiled message to Democrats in Congress: Fund the President’s Space Force or risk a $3 trillion hit to the economy.
But Democrats have been clear: The space force is expensive and dumb, and Congress won’t pay for it.
That hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from pushing for it.
“Space is fundamental to our modern way of life,” Patrick Shanahan, acting secretary of defense, said at the annual Space Symposium in Colorado Springs.
Shanahan, a former Boeing executive who is under investigation for allegedly favoring to his former employer for military contracts, described the many ways in which the U.S. economy relies on space: GPS, satellite imagery, phone, television, even the internet. “Space is fundamental to our modern way of life.” — Patrick Shanahan, acting defense secretary
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, speaking at the same conference, went so far as to put a price tag on all those satellites and the industry on the ground that builds, launches, and monitors them: $400 billion in 2019, a figure that he projected could rise to $3 trillion by 2040 as space-based manufacturing and moon-mining potentially get underway.
But access to all those riches depends on American control of space, Shanahan said. And control of space depends on the United States standing up a separate military branch for orbital operations: “We need a military organization to ensure the free navigation of the stars—a sixth military branch,” Shanahan clarified.
The Trump officials’ demand represents a rhetorical escalation of a political battle that began in February 2018, when Trump first proposed “space force.”
“We're doing a tremendous amount of work in space, and I said, ‘Maybe we need a new force. We’ll call it the space force,” Trump said at a campaign rally in San Diego. “I was not really serious, and then I said, ‘What a great idea. Maybe we'll have to do that.’”
Space force caught on fast with Trump's base. Alongside “build the wall,” “space force” became a popular chant at Trump's many rallies. The Trump campaign peddled hats and t-shirts with fantastical space-force logos, including one that was a clear rip-off of NASA's own logo.
American Media, Inc., the New York City-based publisher of The National Enquirer , slapped together a glossy, space-force magazine special that was chock full of errors, misrepresentations, and outright lies.
While many Americans laughed , most of Trump’s cabinet and many senior military officials and space-industry executives, led by Vice President Mike Pence in his capacity as the head of the U.S. Space Council, dutifully laid out plans for the new military branch.
It started small-ish. In February, Trump signed a directive calling for the branch's establishment first as a new command within the Air Force.
The new command, with two four-star generals and a new civilian undersecretary at the head, would be “a step toward a future separate military department for space,” an administration official told Defense News , a trade publication.
Never mind that space force, even in its inside-the-Air-Force interim form, is just a new bureaucracy. Never mind that senior military leaders—including James Mattis, Trump’s defense secretary until he resigned in January—have opposed adding more bureaucracy to the already top-heavy military.
Even Air Force general John Hyten, the head of U.S. Strategic Command and Trump's nominee to become the new vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, questioned the standalone space force. “I had some concerns,” Hyten in March told the House Armed Services Committee.
But the Trump administration is determined to turn the campaign slogan into an actual, sixth military branch.
There's a catch. Congress, not the White House, establishes new branches of the armed services. Even setting up a new command inside the Air Force requires Congress's approval.
And in November 2018, Democrats took control of the House of Representatives. Suddenly Trump couldn't count on Republican lawmakers to rubber-stamp the first new military branch since the Air Force in 1947 split from the Army. “We ought to be asking ourselves, are we just dazzled by this notion of a space force? Is this going to make us safer?” — Sen. Dick Durbin
Key Democrats in the House and Senate made it clear that Trump would not get his separate space force, perhaps not even in the interim form the administration proposed in February.
“We’re told that the bureaucracy that we would create will cost $2 billion over the next five years,” Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, said in March.
“But we ought to be asking ourselves, are we just dazzled by this notion of a space force?” Durbin asked. “Is this going to make us safer? Would $2 billion spent on new equipment, better equipment, more training for those who operate the equipment be a better investment in national defense than a space force?”
Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington State Democrat and chair of the House Armed Services Committee, in March called Trump's interim space-force proposal “highly problematic.”
Smith said he objected to the space force's cost and top-heavy command structure and the loose and easy-to-abuse spending rules the administration proposed in order to transfer as many as 16,000 people from existing military space organizations into the interim space force.
As long as Democrats control the House of Representatives, Trump is unlikely to get his standalone space force—and might not even get a new, temporary space command inside the Air Force.
The obstacles explain the administration's red-faced rhetoric in Colorado Springs. It's classic Trumpism. When you run into opposition, scream and yell about some terrible threat to the American people. Some terrible threat only Trump can defeat.
“President Trump cast a bold vision,” Shanahan said. “We need to establish space force to protect our future.”
Too bad for Trump that Democrats disagree."
Fox News’ Shep Smith and John Roberts Tag-Team to Fact-Check Trump Lies on Family Separation,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-shep-smith-and-john-roberts-tag-team-to-fact-check-trump-lies-on-family-separation,"NOT SO FAST Fox News’ Shep Smith and John Roberts Tag-Team to Fact-Check Trump Lies on Family Separation Two of the cable channel’s news-side reporters dismantled the president’s attempts to gaslight about his own border policies. 04.09.19 4:07 PM ET Fox News
Hours after President Trump falsely claimed his predecessor was the one responsible for separating migrant children from their families, Fox News anchor Shepard Smith and chief White House correspondent John Roberts tag-teamed to deliver a comprehensive fact-check of the president’s lies.
During a press spray at the White House on Tuesday, Trump repeated the falsehood that President Obama’s administration instituted the specific policy of separating families at the border, wildly claiming he was “the one that stopped it” while insisting that he isn’t looking at reinstating his zero-tolerance policy to stem the flow of migrants at the southern border.
“President Obama separated the children,” Trump exclaimed. “Those cages that were shown, I think they were very inappropriate. They were built by President Obama's administration. Not by Trump. President Obama had child separation. Take a look. The press knows it, you know it, we all know it.”
Noting that Trump has made similarly false claims in the past when it comes to the separation of migrant families, Smith went on to highlight how both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations had operations to arrest, imprison, and deport those here illegally, but they gave children a pass and tended to keep families together.
“There were exceptions, but it was not the policy to separate,” Smith said of the Obama administration. “After President Trump issued the zero tolerance order, officials did separate children from their parents. Some families have not yet been reunited.”
As for the use of cages, Smith pointed out that “it is true” that the Obama administration kept some children in “chain-linked enclosures” during a 2014 surge in border crossings, adding that the administration “started jailing families together as family units.” The Fox anchor also said reporting shows that “Obama administration officials considered separating families, but opted not to do so.""
“The Trump administration did separate families,” Smith declared. “The Trump Department of Homeland Security estimates more than 2,300 children had been separated from their families by last spring. And the Trump administration did detain children in cages. An unknown number of those children is still not back with their families.”
Later in the segment, while reporting on Trump insisting that he’s not looking to reinstate family separations, Roberts addressed the president’s claims that “President Obama had the law” and “we changed” it.
“The accurate reporting is that the zero-tolerance policy about prosecuting head of household was enacted under the Trump administration,” Roberts stated."
"They Were Hired to Murder a Man’s Ex-Wife, But Accidentally Killed Her Sister: Sheriff",www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/they-were-hired-to-murder-amanda-canales-but-accidentally-killed-her-sister-instead-sheriff,"CHARGED They Were Hired to Murder a Man’s Ex-Wife, But Accidentally Killed Her Sister: Sheriff In 2017, a man allegedly paid two Washington teens $2,400 to kill his ex-wife. In a case of mistaken identity, they killed her sister instead, authorities said. 04.09.19 2:53 PM ET REUTERS
Just four hours after allegedly killing 24-year-old Alisha Canales-McGuire, a Washington teen filmed a video of himself fanning out over $2,000 in cash at his Spokane home.
You’ll “never guess what I did 4 this check,” the boy wrote in a caption on the Sep. 2017 video, according to a 22-page probable cause affidavit filed by the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office Monday evening.
Authorities allege the then-19-year-old, along with a 16-year-old girl, were hired by a man to murder his ex-wife, Amanda Canales. But in a tragic case of mistaken identity, the teens instead gunned down Canales-McGuire, the intended victim’s little sister, according to the affidavit.
“She had been staying at her sister’s home and it is believed her sister, who was out of town at the time, was the intended target of the murder-for-hire by her ex-husband,” a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office said Tuesday.
The ex-husband, 31-year-old Kevin Lewis, and the hired killers, now 20 and 17, were arrested Monday night on charges of aggravated first-degree murder with a firearm and first-degree criminal conspiracy to commit murder, authorities said. Lewis, who is already in jail on 2018 assault charges, was also charged with solicitation to commit murder.
The 20-year-old and 17-year-old have not been publicly identified.
“It’s a relief to have the world know what my family and I have known the whole time,” Amanda Canales, who had three children with Lewis during their eight-year marriage, told The Daily Beast on Tuesday. “Now the world knows what kind of man Kevin Lewis is, finally.”
On Sept. 20, 2017, Canales-McGuire was babysitting her nephew and two nieces for her sister, who was on a business trip in New York, when the doorbell rang at around 1:55 a.m.
Trying not to wake up the children and their nanny, she opened the door quickly, the affidavit says. Canales-McGuire had little time to react: The young man came around the corner and began firing as soon as she opened the door, authorities said.
“The two drove from Spokane, where they were both living at the time of the murder, to Snohomish County,” authorities said . “Cell phone records put the phones of both suspects at locations consistent with traveling together and with the timing of the murder.”
Both teens repeatedly shot Canales-McGuire, never questioning whether she was their intended target, according to the affidavit.
“Patrol arrived on scene and found Alisha basically dead in the doorway of the home,” a spokesperson for the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office told KING-TV . “We believed at the time even, that the intended victim was going to be the victim’s sister who had had a very difficult break up and rocky relationship with her ex-husband.”
Detectives believe the teens were initially approached by Lewis a few months before the slaying, at which point he allegedly offered them $2,400 to get his ex-wife “out of the way.”
During their 2017 divorce, Canales was granted full custody of their three children, and Lewis was required to pay the 31-year-old $800 per month in child support. The outcome enraged Lewis—who had recently been charged with assault for a November 2016 incident that landed his wife in the hospital—and he threatened to murder her if he didn’t get his children back, Canales said.
“He said, ‘Come back home or else I’m going to take you to court, and I’m going to get full custody, child support and alimony, and if I don’t get it I’m going to kill you,’” she told the Beast.
On the night of the murder, Lewis told investigators “he was home all night,” according to the court documents.
Investigators finally got a break in the murder case in 2018, when they received a tip that a girl had admitted at a party that she was hired to kill someone in Snohomish County.
“The female suspect allegedly bragged to several acquaintances that she’d been hired to kill someone,” the affidavit states .
The girl, who was just 16 at the time of the murder and had once dated Lewis’ cousin, allegedly claimed she and her accomplice were originally offered $10,000 by a “baby daddy” to kill a woman. According to the affidavit, the pair actually “negotiated the price from Kevin Lewis’ first offer of $1,500 to the final agreement of $2,400.”
The 20-year-old is currently being held in the Snohomish County jail on $5 million bail and the teen girl is being held in the Denney Juvenile Justice Center. It was not immediately clear whether they have attorneys."

Israelis are tired of Benjamin Netanyahu, their scandal-scarred prime minister, but apparently not so tired that they are prepared to turn the reins of power to a center-left coalition.
Netanyahu’s Likud Party finished second in Israel’s parliamentary elections Wednesday, but the parties of Israel’s right emerged as the apparent winners, according to exit polls. Both Netanyahu and his opponent, Benny Gantz, a former general, claimed victory .
For Netanyahu and Israel, it looks like 2009 all over again. Back then, Likud and Netanyahu took the silver but ultimately claimed the prize after the winning centrist party failed to establish a governing coalition. Still, it is also clear that Netanyahu no longer holds the hearts of his countrymen, if he ever did.
With a Netanyahu-led government emerging the likely outcome, Israel’s status as another point of conflagration in America’s cold civil war—along with Trump, immigration, and abortion—will be assured.
Appearing before the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas last Saturday , Trump left no doubt about his love for his Israeli counterpart. His affection was reciprocated. Netanyahu-Trump billboards plastered Israel’s intersections. As for the Democrats, the story could not have been any more different.
This past Sunday, Beto O’Rourke c alled Bibi a racist , no sugar coating there. On Monday, Bernie Sanders expressed his hope that Netanyahu lost, and somewhere in between Pete Buttigieg voiced his displeasure with Netanyahu’s plans for annexation of parts of the West Bank. All this is a long way from President Harry Truman recognizing Israel or President Bill Clinton embracing the memory of Yitzhak Rabin, Israel’s slain prime minister.
Practically, Sanders & Co. are a lot closer to the world views held by President Jimmy Carter, a one-term president, and the late Sen. George McGovern, the Democrats’ failed 1972 presidential nominee. They are also nearer to where the Democratic rank-and-file now stands. As the Republicans learned during the 2016 presidential primaries, the wishes of the donor base are not necessarily in sync with those of the voters.
To be clear, this did not happen overnight. Rather, it is a product of changing realities and demographics in both countries.
When Israelis went to the polls in 2015, Netanyahu was busy warning Israel’s Jews that the country’s Arabs—who are Israeli citizens—were voting “in droves.” To many Democrats, including President Obama, Netanyahu’s campaign pitch sounded flatly racist: “How dare they vote?” This time, reports have emerged of Netanyahu’s Likud Party planted cameras at Arab polling stations to intimidate Arab Israelis. The lyrics are new; the tune remains the same.
Even as a minority- and youth-driven upstairs-downstairs coalition is occupying a larger space within the Democratic Party in the United States, Israel’s blood-and-soil roots are becoming more visible. Bluest America doesn’t cotton all that well to an increasingly ethnically and religiously driven Jewish state, much as Israeli Jews are not feeling warm and fuzzy over relaxed immigration policies and diversity as ends in themselves. By the numbers, nearly three-quarters of Israelis want fewer or no new immigrants, according to Pew.
Like Trump, Netanyahu could care less about the Democrats’ coalition of the ascendant, a pastiche of millennials, minorities, and women. Despite howls from the American Jewish Committee and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Netanyahu made his peace and a pact with Israel’s version of the KKK—“Otzma Yehudit,” the Jewish Power Party—much as Trump received the backing of white nationalists and David Duke in his bid against Hillary Clinton.
Said differently, unadulterated ethno-nationalism is in full bloom in the Land of Milk and Honey. Yair Netanyahu, the prime minister’s combative son, had previously posted to his Facebook page memes of Pepe the Frog and George Soros , and actually won plaudits from Duke . At the time, Ehud Barak, who had unseated Yair’s father in 1999 for the prime minister’s job, had this to tweet: “Is this what the boy hears at home? Is it genetics or his very own mental illness?”
Although most Americans remain pro-Israel, the same cannot be said for liberal Democrats. According to Gallup , nearly as many liberal Democrats sympathize more with the Palestinians (38 percent) as with the Israelis (41 percent), a virtual tie that hints at what’s in store during the 2020 primary season and at the Democratic convention slated for Milwaukee.
In case anyone forgot, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), then a congressman, was booed at the 1988 Democratic Convention over the party’s stance toward Israel and the Palestinians. At the 2016 convention, the Democrats again embraced a pro-Israel platform despite audibly voiced dissatisfaction by the convention delegates.
This time out, don’t expect differences to be readily papered over. Netanyahu’s Israel is a political flashpoint, and one that our president will pounce on with glee.
Even before the election results, Trump was pushing for American Jews to abandon the Democratic Party aka Jexodous, a gambit that has received a ton of attention. Although the chances of wholesale rejection are unlikely, recent polls show Trump barely underwater , 45-52, among New York’s Jewish voters.
Anxiety among Jewish voters caused by the emergence of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib is real and palpable. Expect the president to magnify those concerns in the months ahead, and Prime Minister Netanyahu to go all-in for his very best friend, an outcome that is great for the GOP, but for Israel and the Democrats not so much.

Trump Posts Bizarre 2020 Video Set to ‘Dark Knight Rises’ Soundtrack,www.thedailybeast.com,Audrey.McNamara@thedailybeast.com (Audrey McNamara),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-posts-bizarre-2020-video-set-to-dark-knight-rises-soundtrack,"Trump Posts Bizarre 2020 Video Set to ‘Dark Knight Rises’ Soundtrack Of course, it goes after Hillary Clinton, Obama, and Rosie O’Donnell. Audrey McNamara 04.09.19 5:44 PM ET
President Trump on Tuesday posted a bizarre video that features no voiceover or distinguishable narrative, but is partly aimed at his sworn enemies: Hillary Clinton, President Obama, CNN, and Hollywood.
The two-minute ad uses Hans Zimmer’s score for The Dark Knight Rises as a dramatic soundtrack to video footage—connected together by shoddily edited jump cuts—of Hillary and Bill Clinton, President Obama, hundred-dollar bills, the CNN logo, a slow-zoom on a Fox News.com headline, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) at the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, and Trump himself speaking at rallies and walking through the corridors of the White House.
“First they ignore you / Then they laugh at you / Then they call you racist,” reads a series of title cards interspersed between this seemingly random collection of images. At one point, without any context, footage of celebrities like Rosie O’Donnell (whom the president has repeatedly called a “pig” ), Amy Schumer, and Bryan Cranston appear on-screen.
During other moments, Trump is seen touching a grave at a memorial visit, shaking hands with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un during their failed Hanoi summit , welcoming Brazil’s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro , and touring a factory warehouse.
“Your Vote / Proved them all wrong / 2020,” the ad concludes, along with a campaign logo featuring the slogan “The Great Victory.”
A campaign official told The New York Times later Tuesday that the video was not created by the campaign. “We like to share content from diehard supporters, and this is just another example of how hard Trump supporters fight for us,” a campaign official told the newspaper. The president has previously publicized other multimedia from his fans, including Twitter user @CarpeDonktum and anonymous Reddit users .
Warner Brothers, for its part, wants the music from The Dark Knight Rises removed from the video.
“The use of Warner Bros.’ score from The Dark Knight Rises in the campaign video was unauthorized,” Paul McGuire, senior vice president of corporate communications at Warner Brothers, told The Daily Beast in a statement. “We are working through the appropriate legal channels to have it removed.” READ THIS LIST"
"Anti-Semitic Slurs Surged on Gab, 4chan After Trump’s Election, ADL Finds",www.thedailybeast.com,kelly.weill@thedailybeast.com (Kelly Weill),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/anti-semitic-slurs-surged-on-gab-4chan-after-trumps-election-anti-defamation-league,"HASHTAGGED HATE Anti-Semitic Slurs Surged on Gab, 4chan After Trump’s Election, ADL Finds Levels haven’t returned to pre-Trump days, spiking again after the president’s inauguration and the deadly right-wing march in Charlottesville. 04.09.19 5:21 PM ET REUTERS
Racist slurs, and anti-Semitic slurs in particular, have steadily increased on two forums popular with the far right after President Trump’s election, a new study finds.
The Anti-Defamation League analyzed Gab and 4chan’s /pol/ board , digital hubs for white supremacists, and found racist attacks also spiked after Trump’s inauguration and the right-wing 2017 Charlottesville march. The overall trend is a near-continuous rise in racist slurs, with anti-Semitic slurs rising at an especially notable rate.
Anti-black and anti-Semitic posts were declining on 4chan’s /pol/ before Trump’s election, according to the ADL. On November 1, 2016, the words “Jew,” “black” “k*ke” or “n***er” each appeared in approximately 2 percent of all /pol/ posts. At that time on Gab, results for “k*ke” and “n***er” were negligible, with results for “Jew” and “black” hovering just under and just over the one-percent mark, respectively.
Trump’s election changed that. Use of the terms rose dramatically in the run-up to Trump’s January 20, 2017 inauguration. That day, nearly 4 percent of /pol/ posts contained the word “Jew,” more than 3 percent contained “n***er,” and more than 1 percent contained “black” or “k*ke.”
Gab, where posters are less anonymous, saw a similar rise in racist sentiment, although use of explicit terms still remained relatively low. Gab posts referencing “Jew” or “black” approached 2 and 3 percent, respectively.
But the inauguration-fueled hatred never really ended. Although use of the terms fell slightly after Trump’s swearing-in festivities ended, they crept up to the same levels in the first months of his term.
Then a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia sent them soaring again. The August rally, Unite the Right, drove a spike in Gab and /pol/ activity for the word “white,” the study shows. The word, which was slowly increasing in use on /pol/ suddenly appeared in more than 6 percent of /pol/ posts after Unite the Right. Gab saw nearly identical numbers.
Since then, use of “Jew” has trended up on both sites. (“Black” saw a slight dip on Gab, but “k*ke” and “n***er” rose.) By January, “Jew” appeared in more than 3 percent of all Gab posts, more than double its use at the beginning of the study in August 2016. READ THIS LIST"

Before there was Donald Trump calling for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” or Ben Carson declaring that Islam is not consistent with the U.S. Constitution, there was Herman Cain. Yep, Cain was truly the godfather of utilizing anti-Muslim hate at the national level for political gain when he shot to the top of the Republican field in 2012. Somehow , that not-so-ancient history has hardly been mentioned as Cain has emerged as Trump’s reported pick for seat on the Federal Reserve.
Over the last few days we’ve been reminded frequently that Cain dropped out of the presidential race after four women bravely came forward to share how Cain had sexually harassed them. (Back then, Trump defended Cain as the victim of a “witch hunt,"" while smearing the female victims as liars who only wanted fame.
Before that “witch hunt,” Cain had shot to the top of the polls amidst a crusade of bigotry that began in March of 2011, when he told a reporter that there would be no place for a Muslim American in his administration. Why? In Cain’s view the goal of every Muslim is to impose Islamic law in our nation : ""There is this creeping attempt to gradually ease Sharia law and the Muslim faith into our government.” Cain then baselessly added that there are Muslims in America who “try to force their Sharia law on the rest of us.""
Days later Cain doubled down, telling Fox News’s Neil Cavuto that “many of the Muslims, they’re not totally dedicated to this country.""
The dual-loyalty smear is one of the vilest tropes out there. To give you a sense of how stunning Cain’s remarks were, the national communications director for CAIR, Ibrahim Hooper to them at the time by stating, ""Even post 9/11 you didn't have this level of mainstreaming of anti-Muslim hate.”
And it got worse from there. In June 2015, Cain told Glenn Beck he would only be open to having a Muslim in government if they first took a loyalty oath . A stunned Beck asked in response, “Are you saying that Muslims have to prove their…that there has to be some loyalty proof?” to which Cain responded, “Yes, to the Constitution of the United States of America.” Cain then rejected asking Mormons or Catholics to take such an oath because, he said, Islam inherently has a “greater dangerous part.”
A month later, Cain ratcheted up his anti-Muslim fearmongering by travelling down to Murfreesboro, Tennessee to meet with people opposed to a proposed mosque there in he midst of what was known as the Ground Zero mosque controversy that had spurred opposition to new mosques nationwide.
Cain, his poll numbers rising, went on Fox News after his visit to Murfreesboro to declare that he agreed with those opposing the mosque because in his view Islam was not akin to “our other traditional religions where it's just about religious purposes.” He hinted that the true goal of the mosque was something much more nefarious: ""I happen to also know that it's not just about a religious mosque… There are other things going on based upon talking to the people closest to the problem.”
Of course, there was zero proof that the mosque was anything other than a place of worship. In fact, the mosque was built several years later and the only problems since have been from anti-Muslim bigots who have tried to vandalize and destroy it.
And then in November 2011, with Cain topping many of the polls for the GOP nomination, he proclaimed during an interview with GQ that “a majority of Muslims share the extremist views.” When pressed by the reporter if the GOP candidate meant Muslims worldwide or in our country, Cain responded, “America.”
There was a leading Republican candidate for President telling America that a majority of American Muslims were potential terrorists. Who knows where Cain would’ve taken his anti-Muslim crusade if he didn’t drop out a few weeks later? Perhaps he would’ve have beaten Trump to the call for a total Muslim ban.
Clearly Cain’s history doesn’t trouble Trump, who last week said about Cain, “I’ve told my folks that’s the man.” Of course he’s Trump’s “man”—after all Cain and Trump are cut from the same cloth with their common history of anti-Muslim bigotry and misconduct with women.
I wish I could say that Cain’s history of anti-Muslim hate would result in enough GOP Senators to reject him. But that’s not reality. After all, nearly two-thirds of 2016 GOP primary voters supported Trump’s proposed total ban on Muslims. READ THIS LIST"
"Investigators: Trans Woman Was Not Beaten In ICE Custody, Despite Independent Autopsy",www.thedailybeast.com,Scott.Bixby@thedailybeast.com (Scott Bixby),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trans-woman-was-not-beaten-in-ice-custody-despite-independent-autopsy-investigators,"On the Border Investigators: Trans Woman Was Not Beaten In ICE Custody, Despite Independent Autopsy After nearly a year of investigation, New Mexico’s chief medical investigator classified Roxsana Hernández Rodriguez’s cause of death as natural. 04.09.19 6:47 PM ET Trangender Law Center
A transgender woman who died in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, after being detained in a privately operated detention center, was not physically abused while in custody, according to a report from the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator—despite an independent autopsy that found she had been beaten.
Roxsana Hernández Rodriguez, a 33-year-old transgender woman from Honduras, died on May 25, 2018, after being transferred to an Albuquerque hospital from a private detention center run by CoreCivic. An independent autopsy conducted after her death claimed to find evidence of physical abuse, with “deep bruising” and evidence of blunt-force trauma “indicative of blows, and/or kicks, and possible strikes with blunt object.” Some injuries on her wrist, that autopsy found, were “typical of handcuff injuries.”
But after nearly a year of investigation, Dr. Kurt Nolte, the state’s chief medical investigator, classified Hernandez’s cause of death as natural , due to complications from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
According to the death investigation summary, Hernandez had a five- to six-month history of untreated infection with HIV, leading to septic shock, dehydration, and emaciation in the months before her detention. A biopsy of one of Hernandez’s lymph nodes demonstrated “multicentric Castleman disease,” a disease of the lymph nodes that behaves much like lymphoma, with an overgrowth of cells in lymphatic tissues throughout the body. Multicentric Castleman disease is not uncommon in people with untreated HIV infection.
According to the findings, Castleman disease eventually lead to Hernandez’s death.
“While a preliminary report from a second autopsy identified soft tissue bleeding over the sides and back of the chest thought to be secondary to physical abuse, we do not share that conclusion,” the office of the medical investigator stated in a release accompanying the death investigation summary. “Ms. Hernandez had extensive fractures of the ribs and sternum (breastbone) consistent with a series of at least 10 cardiac arrests with successful rounds of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by medical personnel working to save her life.”
“This case has taken almost a year to close because the autopsy was complex and required additional testing and consultation. We wanted to ensure we answered all the questions we could about Ms. Hernandez’s death,” Dr. Nolte said in a statement accompanying the findings. “Our thoughts are with her family and loved ones. We know that releasing her autopsy report will bring a flood of emotions for them. We have done our best to ensure her cause and manner of death were fully investigated to hopefully provide some level of closure.”
Hernández, known as “Roxy” to her friends, traveled more than 2,000 miles alongside 1,300 other migrants seeking asylum in the United States. After arriving at the U.S. border and asking for asylum at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in May, she was taken into custody. After being held for five days, she was transferred to the CoreCivic facility, which houses a dedicated “pod” for transgender women. Less than three weeks after arriving in the U.S., she was dead.
In a statement, the Transgender Law Center, which had advocated on behalf of Hernandez’s family, called the findings “incomplete”
“The NM OMI dragged their feet in releasing Roxsana’s autopsy report only to let ICE run the show and use the report to do their dirty work of shirking responsibility for her care. It’s absolutely appalling that they presented their findings to ICE prior to offering those findings to Roxsana’s family’s legal representatives,” said Lynly Egyes, director of litigation for Transgender Law Center (TLC), about the report.
A CoreCivic spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of the findings, coting healthcare privacy laws. An ICE spokesperson told The Daily Beast that “the report speaks for itself.”
Following the results of Hernandez’s secondary autopsy in November, the agency disputed the findings.
“ICE takes very seriously the health, safety and welfare of those in our care, including those who come into ICE custody with prior medical conditions or who have never before received appropriate medical care,” the spokesperson said at the time. “Any death that happens in ICE custody is a cause for concern, and the agency will continue its full review of this case according to standard protocols.”"
‘Norma Jeane Baker of Troy’ Loses Marilyn Monroe—and Its Bored Hudson Yards Audience,www.thedailybeast.com,tim.teeman@thedailybeast.com (Tim Teeman),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/norma-jeane-of-troy-starring-ben-whishaw-and-renee-fleming-loses-marilyn-monroeand-its-bored-audience,"PAST IMPERFECT ‘Norma Jeane Baker of Troy’ Loses Marilyn Monroe—and Its Bored Hudson Yards Audience ‘Norma Jeane Baker of Troy’ is the first production at NYC’s new cultural center. But this play about Marilyn Monroe and Helen of Troy is so poor, audiences are walking out. 04.09.19 9:08 PM ET Courtesy Stuart Kellsy
They left, singles and couples, and at least one group of three or four, softly plodding to the exits.
However ambitious, or (dread word) challenging you want your opening production to be, the overseers of theater at The Shed, New York’s bright, shiny, new artistic leviathan at Hudson Yards, could not have welcomed the sight of so many people walking out of their debut production, Norma Jeane Baker of Troy (to May 19) , on Saturday night.
This wasn’t a long performance either, but rather an intermissionless 90 minutes. This critic estimates he saw about 10-15 people leaving; a conservative estimate which doesn’t take into account any who snuck out before my eyes drifted over to the escapees heading to the exit.
That this “spoken and sung performance piece,” which officially opens tonight, isn’t so much better is surprising as it features big stars ( Ben Whishaw and Renée Fleming ), and it was written by poet, essayist and scholar Anne Carson and directed by the celebrated Katie Mitchell.
Yet despite all this blue-chipness, Norma Jeane Baker of Troy is a strange, lifeless, opaque mess, possessing a kind of theatrical pretension that gets ridiculed in plays or films about theatrical pretension.
It is a play formed, we learn in the program, through Euripedes' Helen , which recast the story of “legendarily the harlot of Troy and destroyer of two civilizations” from her point of view, and her sorrow. In the program, #MeToo and that exhaustingly overused phrase “fake news” are both invoked, as well as Carson's intention to “let dark realities materialize dimly” in particular sections of the play.
Well, Norma Jeane Baker of Troy can claim success on that score at least. The set, far too far away from the audience, feels like a retreating photograph. On it, you had two otherwise-wonderful performers, Whishaw and Fleming, playing within what first looks like the office of a gumshoe.
It’s New Year’s Eve, turning to New Year’s Day, 1963, with fireworks booming outside like bombs. Whishaw’s character has a mood board of sorts, and—it turns out—is not a detective, but a screenwriter working on a film project that is a meditation on both Marilyn Monroe (who died the previous year) and Helen of Troy.
The script drifts, utterly unmoored, between the two, their lives, ambitions, beliefs, and the men, dramas, and in Helen’s case war. Misogyny, ambition, and marriage pulse as themes.
As the play progresses, Whishaw, darting here and there, gradually changes into Monroe —via breast and buttock padding, make up and a wig—until finally putting on a dress that recalls the famous flowing white dress Monroe wore in The Seven Year Itch . As Monroe, we hear of the actress’ private pain; there are pills, a champagne bottle that stubbornly refused to pop open (how symbolic that seemed on Saturday night), and then death.
Alongside Whishaw, Fleming sings beautifully, sometimes echoes of the text, sometimes not. It’s not entirely clear who she is (a co-writer? a secretary?). There is also mention of Menelaus, Helen of Troy’s husband and Hermione, her daughter (although in the haze of the play, you may be forgiven for thinking the play is speaking of a Monroe daughter called Hermione, when she didn’t have one).
The result is an impressionistic Pandora’s Box, known only to itself. Whishaw and Fleming do not perform badly; what on earth they are performing is the issue, and it is baffling that nobody at some point in the rehearsal process put a hand in the air and said, “Excuse me, what the hell is this about? And shouldn’t we at least make it wholly audible?” “If only somebody had asked in creating this play: who are these characters, where are they, what are they doing, what is this about, how can we make it clearer to the audience? Why all the pauses?”
When Whishaw’s character asks, “Do we leave now?” it may take great collective inner strength for an audience not to respond, “Excellent question, can we?”
If only somebody had asked in creating this play: who are these characters, where are they, what are they doing, what is this about, how can we make it clearer to the audience?
It shouldn't be philistinish to expect some degree of clarity from even the most experimental theatrical piece. The people who walked out on Saturday night didn’t want to when they took their seats. They didn’t expect to. 90 minutes isn’t that long to sit and watch some theatre, but—as the audience exodus reveals—what should have been a triumphant heralding of a major new Manhattan theatre space turned out to be the absolute, thudding opposite.
Mrs. Murray’s Menagerie
Everything is so understated in Ars Nova's Mrs Murray’s Menagerie (Ars Nova at Greenwich House, 27 Barrow Street, to April 27) directed by Lila Neugebauer, that you don’t realize how brilliant You Sin-Chen and Laura Jellinek’s set is. It really does feel like a drab meeting room where a focus group are meeting to discuss their feelings about a popular children’s television show.
The unseen producers of the show want to create a spin-off from it: Candace’s Closet or Teddy’s Treehouse . This focus group—made up of the all-excellent Philip James Brannon, Joe Curnutte. Michael Dalto, Carmen M. Herlihy, January LaVoy, and Stephanie Wright Thompson—will help change that.
This Mad Ones' production is just as subtle and direct in its wonderful writing and characterization. Focus group questioner Dale (a drily unreadable Brad Heberlee) has an assistant Jim (an earnest and nervy Marc Bovino) who must write comically quickly on a blackboard all the group’s responses to questions (he is so fast he earns our applause).
There are no big emotional speeches by any members of this group, but instead we watch a steady accumulation of life detail and tensions around sexism and racism that simmer while questions about the show are asked and answered. It's both very funny and extremely excruciating.
Just why is Mrs. Murray so benign? Who is their favorite character? In answering what is asked of the group, Roger will reveal himself to be a creepy mansplainer; Gloria someone who wants to be listened to; Celeste as an assertive mother; Wayne a gruff, slightly menacing dad; Ernest, watchful and direct; and June, who wants to believe the best in people. We never see the characters fully, but we see a tantalizing approximation of who they may be, and what they would show of themselves in a focus group setting.
There are unseen problems in marriages and a growing sense of anger towards Roger. But nothing erupts in this focus group; the focus is on a flowing, then tightening, set of group dynamics. Our eyes flick to the minute shifts of expressions and reactions. Mrs. Murray's Menagerie is both plain and intriguing—and no walkouts."
Measles Crisis: NYC Outbreak Pits Parents Against Mayor,www.thedailybeast.com,Jaclyn Jeffrey-Wilensky,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/measles-crisis-nyc-outbreak-pits-parents-against-mayor,"'$1,000 FINES ARE A JOKE' Measles Crisis: NYC Outbreak Pits Parents Against Mayor “When the outbreak started a few months ago, they should have literally shut down every noncompliant yeshiva,” one dad said. 04.09.19 9:06 PM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Getty
For many observant Jews, the weeks leading up to the Passover holiday are spent in a cleaning frenzy: The house is scrubbed from top to bottom in compliance with Jewish law, which dictates that Jews avoid leavened bread for the duration of the holiday.
This year, some members of Williamsburg’s Hasidic Jewish community will have one more task on their to-do list: get their kids vaccinated, or pay up. That was the choice presented to them Tuesday, when Mayor Bill de Blasio declared the enclave’s ongoing measles outbreak a public health emergency.
“The goal here is to send a message that people need to act immediately to get vaccinated, and that vaccination is available readily here in the neighborhood and throughout the city,” Mayor de Blasio said.
Along with the emergency declaration came an order: all parents in the affected zip codes must give their children the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Parents who don’t comply risk violations and fines of up to $1,000.
That message is being heard loud and clear in Williamsburg. But some say it’s too little, too late.
“$1,000 fines are a joke,” said one Hasidic father, who asked that his name not be shared in order to protect his privacy. “Lives are at risk.”
The father, whose son attends yeshiva in Williamsburg, was also skeptical of the city’s ability to enforce Monday’s Commissioner’s Orders forbidding area yeshivas from admitting unvaccinated students .
“When the outbreak started a few months ago, they should have literally shut down every noncompliant yeshiva,” he said. The father added that some of his neighbors in the community felt distrustful of the city government and secular doctors, complicating the outreach efforts mounted by the city and community leaders.
Other community members felt that the order was overly restrictive.
“It’s like abuse,” said Baila, a Hasidic mother who said she was unsure about whether vaccination was the right choice but respected those who did choose to vaccinate. “Why can’t we make our own decision?”
She added that she had vaccinated her oldest child, but was unsure about whether to vaccinate her younger children after her sister-in-law told her that vaccines could have negative health effects for young children.
Since September, at least 285 cases of measles have been reported to the Department of Health, most from the Williamsburg and Borough Park neighborhoods. The figure, accurate as of April 8, was more than double the number reported in February of this year.
According to the Centers for Disease Control , the MMR vaccine is very safe. Common side effects are minor, and more serious side effects, like seizures, low platelet count, and allergic reactions, are extremely rare.
Still other community members fell somewhere in the middle when it came to mandatory vaccines.
“Maybe it’s a little too harsh, but I think it’s a good thing to get vaccinated,” said one mother, who declined to give her name, as she pushed a stroller across Lee Avenue in Williamsburg.
Jay Begun, founder of Kindercare Pediatrics in Williamsburg and an instructor in the Department of Pediatrics at Mount Sinai, is cautiously optimistic about the new order, especially in conjunction with the increased pressure on yeshivas to keep unvaccinated students at home. “Maybe it’s a little too harsh, but I think it’s a good thing to get vaccinated.” — Anonymous mother
“I think those who are anti-vaxxers in any community will try and resist some of these measures, but I believe the vast majority of people will comply with the health department’s recommendation,” he said. He added that he hoped that the health department wouldn’t have to resort to the punitive measures described in the emergency declaration.
“No one wants fines,” he said.
The announcement was well-timed: the upcoming Passover holiday could possibly cause a spike in measles cases. Family dinners and well-attended religious services could put many unvaccinated people in contact with one another.
“[Passover] in the Hasidic community happens to be an extremely sanitary holiday,” said Naftuli Moster, executive director of Yaffed, a group advocating for improved secular education of yeshiva students. “On the other hand, there are many opportunities for kids to get together and spread germs and disease.”
Health department commissioner Oxiris Barbot said that the department would be using contact tracing, a public health technique in which people who come into contact with an sick person are monitored for signs of infection, to target their efforts. If people get vaccinated within three days of exposure, they’ll be protected from the disease, Barbot explained.
“The point here is not fine people, but to make it easier for them to get vaccinated,” she said. “$1,000 fines are a joke. Lives are at risk.” — Anonymous father
In the meantime, Mayor de Blasio said, the health department would continue its efforts to reach out to the community through local organizations. The Daily Beast previously reported that the city was working with the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg and North Brooklyn to educate parents on the importance of MMR vaccination, and to help bring yeshivas into compliance with the health department’s rules.
“They’ve been supportive of the pediatricians and they’re encouraging,” Begun said of the health department. “Aside from going to home to home with lists and forcibly immunizing children, I don’t know what the answer is.” READ THIS LIST"
CNN Employees Revolt: Don’t Take Away Our Equinox Discount,www.thedailybeast.com,Maxwell.Tani@thedailybeast.com (Maxwell Tani),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnn-employees-revolt-dont-take-away-our-equinox-discount,"SWOLE ON NEWS CNN Employees Revolt: Don’t Take Away Our Equinox Discount Staffers at both CNN and HBO are hopping mad about new parent company WarnerMedia’s lackluster markdown on luxury gym memberships. 04.09.19 8:00 PM ET Dave M. Benett/Getty
There’s a revolt brewing among CNN and HBO employees over an urgent internal matter: Equinox membership fees.
Over the past several weeks, staffers have raised concerns about the end of a large discount on memberships at the luxury gym chain for employees at WarnerMedia, CNN and HBO’s parent company.
CNN employees currently pay $110 per month for an Equinox membership that allows them access to all clubs, according to a petition circulated among employees at the network. Per an internal email, however, that discount is set to end on June 30 when WarnerMedia employees switch to the Equinox discount provided to employees of AT&T, which recently acquired WarnerMedia.
Now, according to the CNN petition, network employees in New York will be forced to fork over $238 per month if they want access to the Hudson Yards Equinox branch, near the cable channel’s newly relocated New York City headquarters.
In response, more than 100 CNN and HBO employees have signed multiple petitions that have circulated around both companies calling for WarnerMedia to allow staffers to keep their original Equinox discount.
“Help us let the parties involved know that we can’t afford this $128/month hike,” reads one petition. “A $1500 annual employee benefit has been stripped away without a comparable replacement,” reads another.
Some CNN employees mocked the petition, of course.
“It’s the most white people first-world problems I’ve ever heard,” one source remarked.
AT&T isn’t leaving the employees without an affordable gym option, however.
According to multiple sources, there is a gym available for WarnerMedia employees at the new New York City Hudson Yards HQ, with a $50 fitness plan available. But the major drawback of the gym is that it is closed on weekends, and according to a petition circulated among HBO staff, fitness classes are not included with basic membership.
WarnerMedia’s current Equinox discount is also better than the one provided by many large New York-based media companies.
It is more generous than the discount provided to some NBCUniversal employees who spoke with The Daily Beast. Employees at both BuzzFeed and IAC, which owns The Daily Beast, are welcome to an Equinox membership rate of $250 per month for locations near their New York City offices.

Late last month, out of the blue, Vice President Mike Pence announced that the United States would land an American on the moon by 2024—four years ahead of schedule.
Now we know why the Trump administration is in such a hurry to get back to the lunar surface: The administration wants to mine the moon, staking a claim on these supposed lunar riches before any other country (most likely China) can—and before the end of Pres. Donald Trump’s possible second term.
At the annual Space Symposium conference in Colorado Springs on Tuesday, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross suggested that there’s so much money to be made on the moon that America better get there first, risk and uncertainty be damned.
“As more countries land on the moon, we risk a Wild West situation without clarification of ownership rights,” Ross said.
But this proverbial lunar gold rush is risky. Congress might not fund it: some critics were already saying a previous NASA effort to land a man on the moon was half-baked and not worth the cost.
Even with a Congressional appropriation, NASA expects it will have to cut other space programs to make way for moon work. Government officials admitted at the conference that some of the technology it needs doesn’t yet exist.
Also, no one really knows how much cobalt, gold, helium, iron, palladium, platinum and tungsten lies under the lunar dust . Even more murky is exactly what it would take to dig it up and process it on the moon or send it back to some factory on Earth.
By Ross’s accounting, the world’s space industry is currently worth $400 billion; by 2040, that could expand nearly tenfold to $3 trillion as governments and corporations establish factories and mining operations in orbit and on the moon. “We must make sure the United States captures the lion’s share of burgeoning space markets,” Ross urged.
A wealthy former investment banker who has been accused of flouting government ethics rules , Ross seemed particularly interested in the financing side of possible off-world industry. “Finance is key,” Ross said at the Colorado conference. “We must make sure the United States captures the lion’s share of burgeoning space markets.” — Wilbur Ross, Commerce Secretary
The last time anyone stepped foot on the moon was in 1972, when NASA’s Apollo 17 mission landed astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt on the lunar surface. Mission pilot Ronald Evans remained in the command module in orbit over the moon.
For several years, NASA has hoped to return to the moon—eventually. Besides being scientifically interesting in its own right, Earth’s dusty satellite might make a good launching pad for a Mars mission, the space agency reasoned. Astronauts in theory could mine lunar ice and process it into rocket fuel for an onward trip to the Red Planet.
But until Pence’s surprise March announcement, the new moon mission was scheduled to take place no earlier than 2028. There were good reasons for NASA to wait until then. The agency planned to build a new, $3-billion, moon-orbiting space station it calls the Lunar Gateway that could function as a staging base for lunar landings. Experts have pointed out that it might be easier to rocket straight from Earth to the moon, like the Apollo missions did. But NASA imagined it eventually would shift the gateway station’s orbit in order also to support a Mars mission.
So NASA needed time to build the Lunar Gateway station’s modules, launch and assemble the modules then develop new vehicles for transferring astronauts from the station to the lunar surface and back.
NASA’s various international partnerships in part drove the Lunar Gateway’s schedule. The Canadian, Japanese, European, and Russian space agencies build critical pieces of hardware that NASA never bothered to master. Canada makes the crane-like robotic arms for spacecraft and space stations. Russia builds many of the airlocks.
In light of all the complications, a 2028 manned moon mission seemed fast; a 2024 mission seems crazy. Speaking alongside Ross at the Colorado conference, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine acknowledged the risks.
Yes, NASA would potentially need billions of dollars on top of the agency’s normal budget from Congress. “We’re working on that,” Bridenstine said. “Politically, we're going to have some challenges ahead.""
Yes, the agency would need to speed up construction of the lunar station. “The first elements of Gateway are focused exclusively on getting humans to the surface of the moon,"" Bridenstine assured the crowd.
Yes, NASA would need someone in government or private industry to quickly invent a three-part lander for transporting people from the station to the moon then back. ""We need to focus like a laser on the descent module, the transfer vehicle and the ascent module,"" Bridenstine added, sweat glistening on his forehead.
Yes, NASA would have to suspend other exploration and science programs in order to focus on landing on the moon within four years. “Anything that’s a distraction to making that happen, we're getting rid of it,” he said.
Yes, the space agency would need help from foreign governments. “None of us can do what we want to do, alone,"" he added.
But all those minerals are worth the trouble for the administration. “We're going to utilize the resources of the moon,” Bridenstine stated, vowing that it would happen before Trump left office after potentially winning a second term.
“The president said he wants 2024,” Bridenstine said. “NASA is up to achieving it.” READ THIS LIST"
Tucker Carlson Guest: ‘We Need Martial Law on the Border’,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/tucker-carlson-guest-we-need-martial-law-on-the-border,"‘IT’S PERFECTLY OBVIOUS’ Tucker Carlson Guest: ‘We Need Martial Law on the Border’ A retired colonel responded to Tucker Carlson’s call for the military to mobilize at the border in response to immigration. 04.09.19 10:16 PM ET Fox News
Insisting that the United States’ sovereignty is under attack by asylum-seeking migrants from Central America, a Fox News guest demanded Tuesday night that the U.S. military declare “martial law” at the southern border.
Opening his primetime Fox News show by calling for the military to mobilize at the border because large-scale migration “is how countries collapse,” Tucker Carlson griped that America’s military force was spread too far around the world, supposedly leaving this country vulnerable.
Bringing on retired Col. Douglas MacGregor to bolster his case, Carlson wondered why “is it so repugnant to the leadership” that troops would “protect us” at the border before asking MacGregor if the purpose of the military is to protect against a “threat to the territorial sovereignty” of the country.
“The U.S. Army belongs on the border right now,” the retired officer said while citing Title 10 of the United States Code. “It’s perfectly obvious to everyone on the border.”
“You can add more patrolmen. You can add more customs officers. It’s not just a function of the wall. They can’t cope with hundreds of thousands of people marching over the borders, especially when they are told if you reach the border, you have to be admitted. We need martial law on the border.”
MacGregor went on to claim that he has spoken to various people in border states and they “all said the same thing—please send troops.”
Border state leaders, however, aren’t all keen on the military at the border. In February, the governors of New Mexico and California announced they were pulling their National Guard troops from the border, calling Trump’s claims of a security crisis “political theater.” Officials in an Arizona border town also passed a resolution to have troop-installed razor wire removed from their border wall.
Trump’s long-sought border wall, meanwhile, is moving along, even if many border-area lawmakers aren’t overly thrilled with it. The Department of Defense just announced it has awarded nearly a billion dollars in contracts to build the wall.
Carlson, who has repeatedly called Mexico a “hostile country” that is “seeking to undermine” the United States by allowing migrants to travel to the border, asked why “would it be offensive to protect this country,” prompting MacGregor to claim it’s because Democrats “see voters moving across the border.”
“No one on the left will advocate for the defense of the border,” he added. “They see in the future a foundation, a human foundation for a permanent dictatorship of the left.”
This is far from the first time that Carlson has advocated for military mobilization at the border. While interviewing then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen last week , Carlson pressed her on whether the administration would commit to sending troops to the border since “it’s really a crisis” the magnitude of a Category Five hurricane.
