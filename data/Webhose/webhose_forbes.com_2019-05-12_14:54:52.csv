"Council Post: Lead With Your Values During A Merger, Revenue Will Follow",www.forbes.com,Matthew Hawkins,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2019/04/11/lead-with-your-values-during-a-merger-revenue-will-follow/,"Getty Merging large and well-established companies isn’t for the faint of heart. But with the right strategy and clear priorities, you can seamlessly combine operations and teams to create a new company that is greater than the sum of its parts. Take it from me — my company just went through it.
This past year, I was fortunate to lead the formation of my company through the merger of three leaders in revenue cycle management. It logically follows that in any big merger, but especially one of companies solely focused on revenue, managing revenue is of course top of mind. But you can’t obsess over revenue goals. Rather, your energy is best spent focusing on your clients and your people through the lens of your core values. For anyone going through a similar transition, here’s some advice — and a few lessons learned along the way.
Listen To Your Clients
Put yourself in your clients’ shoes. Their experience should be one of seamless improvement. If you suspect (or know) that a client is experiencing hiccups or decreases in service, that’s a clear indicator that something needs to change.
One thing that helped my team to prepare for the merger was to set up continuous feedback loops with clients to ensure that new product features and enhancements were implemented seamlessly. Throughout the transition, the company dedicated a concierge-like client service team for any complex issue that arose and checked in with clients weekly in the lead-up to its new platform launch. Proactive monitoring teams were then assigned to every client for the 30 days following the upgrade.
Take Care Of Your Team And Live Your Values
Supporting your internal team is the other side of the client-focus coin. Your people are the soul of your organization, and they are your ambassadors in the world. If you are transparent and respectful with your team, they will care for your clients and be loyal to your business, even during times of change. It’s up to your leadership team to let employees know you have their back.
Interactions with clients and team members should be guided by your corporate mission and values. As you begin the merger process, be intentional about the values you chose to steer your new, combined company. These should be more than talking points — values need to be infused into meetings and day-to-day operations.
Talk with your team as often as you can, and be open. You will find that teams respect candor and appreciate the difficulty of that openness. Finding the right balance of vulnerability and transparency while guiding an organization through difficult decisions is no easy feat, but it is an important step in laying the foundation for long-term success and value creation — which is ultimately what you are striving for with an integration or merger.
Work Toward True Unity
If you’re going to merge companies, you have to keep the goal of a truly unified new company at the forefront of every decision — before the merger even begins. It’s crucial to evaluate the compatibility of your companies not only in terms of business and operational goals, but culturally as well. That’s not to say they should be identical (no two companies are), but there should be a reasonable expectation of eventual unity and a roadmap to get there.
In my company’s case, part of this involved figuring out how to pick the best technology platforms to build one unified platform, get clients onto that platform and put a plan in place that would allow legacy teams to work together effectively. Many companies take the easier route of “bolting on” technology in a mergers and acquisitions situation without fully developing a technology integration plan. But doing the work up-front results in a better product for every client.
In addition to merging operations and products, it’s important to prioritize building one unified culture across your distributed offices. Establishing a performance culture and ensuring that every single person, no matter where they are, experiences the company the same way is worth getting right. Challenge yourself to build a company that is a single culture, even if it is in multiple locations.
Technology can be a great tool in connecting people across geography, but it can also be a distraction. For example, when it’s not possible for team members to be in the same location for a meeting, video conferencing helps to ensure as much interaction as possible. On the other hand, in my experience, encouraging team members to “be present” by limiting phones and laptops during meetings improves productivity and further helps to break down geographic silos.
By really committing to the new, unified company, you build upon the strengths of each legacy company and ultimately create a better product and a more robust corporate culture than any of the individual entities could have achieved alone.
The Bottom Line
It’s easy to get caught up in short-term revenue as a key indicator of success, and in doing so neglect to truly listen to client feedback or take your employees for granted. Those lapses in judgment and strategy account for much of why so many mergers fail.
If you stay in frequent, open communication with clients through a transition — including information about the added value you’ll be bringing them as a result — they will be more likely to stick with you. It worked for my company. Not only did it retain customers, but it deepened and grew relationships with them.
Likewise, if you are as transparent with your internal teams as possible, sharing the potential benefits as well as challenges they might encounter along the way, they’ll continue to be motivated to do their best work. And, by doing your research up front about the compatibility of culture and values, you’ll avoid insurmountable obstacles down the line.
Mergers are huge undertakings. By staying focused on these three strategies and the common set of fully lived company values, you can help make sure your company emerges even stronger.

Trail Blazers Playoff Preview: Keys For Series Against Thunder,www.forbes.com,Mike Tokito,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/miketokito/2019/04/13/trail-blazers-playoff-preview-keys-for-series-against-thunder/,"The Portland Trail Blazers start their latest run in the NBA playoffs Sunday when they begin their seven-game first-round series against the Oklahoma City Thunder at 12:30 p.m. at the Moda Center. The Blazers have homecourt advantage as the No. 3 seed, but they will play an opponent that swept them in four games during regular season.
Portland also has to overcome whatever psychological hurdles exist over its recent playoff struggles. The Blazers were also the No. 3 seed last season, but were swept in shocking fashion in the first round by New Orleans. The Blazers haven’t won a playoff series since 2016, and indeed haven’t even won a playoff game since that year, with an active 10-game playoff losing streak.
The headline matchup of the series is undoubtedly at point guard, where Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook have had some remarkable performances against each other this season, with Lillard scoring 51 points in one game, and Westbrook getting two triple-doubles.
“He’s one of the top point guards in the league and so am I,” Lillard said. “When you get out there and you know that your team is going to go as you go, he has to outplay me and I have to outplay him if I want my team to win, so that’s just what it turns into.”
Both point guards are so good, their matchup might well be a wash. For the Blazers to win, other factors will have to come into play.
Here are some of the keys for the Blazers in the series
Limiting turnovers: The Thunder averaged 120.8 points in their four wins against Portland, 6.3 more than their overall season average, and 10.3 points more than the Blazers season average in points against.
Although the Blazers certainly have to tighten up defensively, one their biggest issues in limiting OKC’s points is their own offense – in particular, limiting turnovers. The Blazers committed 59 turnovers in the four losses, and more crucially, 41 of those turnovers were by Thunder steals. OKC led the NBA in steals at 9.3 per game.
Live-ball turnovers against OKC are especially costly. The Thunder scored 85 points on fastbreaks against the Blazers, with 75 points coming off turnovers.
Big D on PG: No player dominated the Blazers this season more than Thunder forward Paul George, whose efforts against Portland included a triple-double of 47 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. George averaged 38 points in the four games against the Blazers.
""It’s tough,” said Blazers forward Maurice Harkless, who figures to guard George much of the time. “You’ve got to try to just contain him, make it hard for him. He’s a great player, he uses the pick and roll really well, he’s been shooting the 3 ball really well this year.”
The Blazers played the Thunder three times before the All-Star break, and in the lone game after that – when Harkless has been much healthier, and the Blazers added another prominent wing, Rodney Hood – George had his least effective against Portland this season. George still scored 32 points, but shot 7 for 23 from the field and 1 for 9 on 3-pointers in an OKC overtime win.
Whoever guards George will have to do so without fouling him – or at least not fouling him as much as Portland did this season. George shot 60 free throws against the Blazers in the four games, an average of 15 per game, and made 51. That means George is averaging 12.7 points per game against the Blazers on free throws alone.
Sharpen up behind arc: The Blazers need to make 3-pointers to win the series, something they just did not do well in their four games against OKC. Portland was 28.5 percent behind the arc in those losses, and in three of those games the Blazers were under 30 percent.
Portland made 39 of 137 attempts on 3’s, compare to 43 makes by OKC on 27 fewer attempts, 110. That sort of efficiency difference is hard to overcome.
Portland especially needs to find ways to get their guards cleaner looks on 3-pointers. Their main 3-point threats – Lillard, CJ McCollum and Seth Curry – had just one good individual 3-point shooting game against the Thunder, McCollum’s 7-for-12 effort in the Jan. 22 matchup.
Remove that performance, and Lillard, McCollum and Curry are a combined 17 for 71 on 3’s against OKC, a paltry 23.9 percent.
The hole in the middle: The Blazers, of course, enter the series missing their starting center, Jusuf Nurkic, who was lost for the season when he suffered a gruesome compound leg break against Brooklyn on March 25.
The saving grace has been Enes Kanter, whom the Blazers signed off the buyout wire. Originally brought in to back up Nurkic, Kanter has started eight games in Nurkic’s place and averaged 18.1 points and 11.4 rebounds and shot 61.5 percent from the field, with Portland going 6-2 in those games.
The matchup against OKC is particularly intriguing for Kanter, who played 2 ½ seasons for the Thunder, most of it coming off the bench behind the player he will be matched up against in the series, Steven Adams.
""He’s definitely one of the post defenders I’ve seen,” Kanter said of Adams. “I remember me and him used to go against each other a lot in practice. It wasn’t basketball, it was like wrestling. You could almost here the bones cracking.”
Even with Kanter, the Blazers will certainly miss Nurkic, who averaged 16.5 points and 13 rebounds and shot 52.2 percent from the field against the Thunder this season.
A secret weapon? Playoff wins often require a performance by a player who goes well beyond his norm and has a huge game.
One player who seems overdue to have an impact game against OKC is Curry, who scored three, four and three points in the first three matchups against the Thunder before getting eight points in the final game on March 7. Right after that game, Curry hit a stride with a 22-point effort against Phoenix. That started a run of 15 games in which he scored in double figures 12 times and averaged 14 points while shooting 45.2 percent on 3-pointers.
An even more tantalizing possibility is rookie Anfernee Simons, who did not appear in any of the OKC games and has only played in 20 games all season. But his last appearance, Wednesday in the regular season finale against Sacramento, produced a memorable performance as he had 37 points and nine assists and shot 7 for 11 on 3-pointers in a game in which coach Terry Stotts sat most of his rotation. With a makeshift lineup, the Blazers rallied from a 28-point deficit and won, earning the No. 3 seed.
It seems unlikely that a coach would stick a little-used 19-year-old into his rotation for the playoffs, but it would be an intriguing gamble and at the very least would produce an uplifting fan response when Simons checks in.
Beating the tide of history: For the Blazers to win the series against the Thunder, they would have to accomplish something no Portland team has ever accomplished in the franchise’s 49 seasons: win a playoff series against a team they did not beat during the regular season.
The Blazers have played 53 playoff series in their history, and have won 20. Of those 20 wins, six have come against teams they had losing records against during the regular season, with four coming against teams they beat once.
But the Blazers’ recent history suggests that lack of regular season success against an opponent doesn’t mean they can’t win a series against that team. In Portland’s two most recent playoff series wins, in 2014 against Houston and 2016 against the Los Angeles Clippers, the Blazers beat a team that won three of four against them during the regular season."

"'Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order' Gets A Fantastic New Trailer, Release Date Announced",www.forbes.com,Erik Kain,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/04/13/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-gets-a-fantastic-new-trailer-release-date/,"During today's panel at the 2019 Star Wars Celebration , Respawn Entertainment unveiled the studio's new game, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. We have the first CGI story trailer and a release date now. We already knew the game would be single-player only with no microtransactions. We also knew that it was being built using Unreal Engine 4 instead of EA's Frostbite engine. So all of that was great news.
Now we have a release date: November 15th, 2019. That's just over a month before Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker hits theaters, and smack-dab in the middle of the busy holiday season.
And we have this story trailer , which is terrific. Check it out:
The game's protagonist is Cal Kestis played by Cameron Monaghan who you may recognize from both Shameless and Gotham, two very different—and very entertaining—TV shows. Monaghan is a little crazy in both of them, though in entirely different ways, and he's a great casting choice here as well.
Fallen Order takes place after Episode III Revenge of the Sith, after the fall of the Jedi Order and during the Empire's secretive Order 66 in which it planned for the extermination of all remaining Jedi, sending Yoda and Obi-Wan and many others into hiding. We've seen a bit of this time period during Star Wars: Rebels which also takes place between the prequel films and the original trilogy.
From the press release:
""Players will meet Cal on Bracca, a brand-new Star Wars planet and one of several new locations introduced in the game. Cal is hiding from the Empire in plain sight but is forced to go on the run when he exposes his Force powers. Along the way, Cal will make new friends, like his mysterious companion Cere, as well as run into some familiar faces, all while being accompanied by his faithful droid BD-1. Cal’s flight from the Empire is made even more dangerous as he is being pursued by the Second Sister, one of the Empire’s elite Inquisitors, who seeks to hunt Cal down and extinguish this surviving Jedi. Assisting the Second Sister are the terrifying Purge Troopers, special Imperial forces trained to seek out Jedi and aid the Inquisitors in their dastardly work.
""Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is designed with gameplay as a top priority in order to deliver the kind of intense Star Wars lightsaber battles that are seen in the films. Brought to life by Respawn, a studio known for high-quality games that are both visually beautiful and technically masterful, players will use their Jedi training to create different melee combinations with an innovative lightsaber combat system and Force abilities. Players will also use traversal and other platforming abilities to strategically overcome opponents and solve puzzles in their path across this galaxy-spanning adventure. Star Wars fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear, and enemies, while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, locations, creatures, droids and adversaries new to Star Wars.""
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
Credit: Respawn So expect to see some lightsaber combat, some wall-running (which Respawn mastered in Titanfall and Titanfall 2 ) and what looks to be a really interesting, somewhat darker Star Wars story. That's great news. I know I'm not the only Star Wars fan whose been waiting for a single-player Star Wars game to finally come out. It's been ages since we've gotten one. In the meantime, we've seen game after game cancelled.
Star Wars 1313 was supposed to be a gritty action-adventure game set in the Star Wars universe. It was cancelled when Disney bought Lucasfilm and closed LucasArts. Visceral's Star Wars game, spearheaded by Uncharted alum Amy Hennig, was cancelled not long ago. Then EA Vancouver's open-world Star Wars game was also cancelled.
That means we've only had two Battlefront games (that were remarkably lackluster) and a mobile game to tide us over. It's almost a miracle that Respawn's game has gotten this far to begin with.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
Credit: Respawn I can't wait to see some actual gameplay and eventually get my hands on this thing. It's definitely looking like everything I wanted from a Star Wars game, and hopefully it convinces Disney and EA that more single-player games set in this universe are what fans are after. Maybe even a game set during the events of the new trilogy? A new Knights of the Old Republic game built with modern tech (not Frostbite, though) would be fantastic also.
There are so many great ways to bring this franchise to video games, it's just unbelievable to me that this is all we have while movie after movie and multiple TV shows are made.
Even Disney and Lucasfilm seem to agree that this is what fans actually want (as opposed to an endless stream of live-service titles.) “When Respawn approached us with the idea for this game, we were immediately supportive. A single player, story-driven title in the Star Wars universe was exactly what we were looking for, and we know the fans have been eager for one, as well,” said Steve Blank, Director, Franchise Content & Strategy, Lucasfilm Story Group in the PR release.
Yes, yes we have been eager for just exactly this. Maybe it's time to stop cancelling these games and actually complete them, release them and watch the money come flowing in.

Who Are Apple's iPhone Contract Manufacturers?,www.forbes.com,Patrick Moorhead,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2019/04/13/who-are-apples-iphone-contract-manufacturers/,"This coming Monday, a highly anticipated trial between Qualcomm and Apple will start in San Diego. The legal showdown is the next, important chapter of a two-year conflict between the two technology powerhouses and now, in this trial, Apple’s contract manufacturers. You can get caught up to speed on the prior two years here . Next week’s festivities are complex, as it is the amalgamation of four lawsuits brought together. Here is suing whom:
Apple is suing Qualcomm for the alleged lack of payments for volume discounts as part of its BCPA (Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement), violating FRAND pricing for its wireless IP, and using its monopolistic position to charge too much for its IP. Apple’s contract manufacturers are suing Qualcomm similarly, for charging too much for its IP. Qualcomm is suing Apple’s contract manufacturers for withholding payments for the use of its IP Qualcomm is suing Apple for alleged tortious interference between Qualcomm and the contract manufacturers. Fun, right? There has been and will continue to be much press about this conflict, but today I wanted to shed light on Apple’s relatively unknown contract manufacturers (CMs) or Original Device Manufacturers (ODMs) who are at the center of this conflict. ODMs, for the uninitiated, work on behalf of companies like Apple to manufacture their smartphones. Apple doesn’t manufacture its own devices and doesn’t actually have an IP agreement with Qualcomm; Qualcomm’s agreements are with the ODMs. I had a few decades of experience with ODMs when I was a hardware OEM and chip guy, and ODMs are an interesting bunch. Let’s take a closer look at who these ODMs are.
Foxconn, $152B revenue
Apple’s biggest ODM is Taiwan-based Foxconn (officially known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., LTD). Foxconn is the world’s biggest provider of electronics manufacturing, employing 250,000 worldwide (as of 2018), with manufacturing sites in Taipei, Suzhou, Mexico City, Madrid, Cleveland, and more. Most of its manufacturing is done in China.
Foxconn was founded by CEO Terry Gou back in 1974, with the stated goal of “providing low cost mechanical and electrical parts to drive down the overall cost of electronics worldwide.” I had met Terry Gou many times one on one when I worked in product management at Compaq Computer and did billions in business with him. Back then, Foxconn made cheap power supply PCBs (printed circuit boards) and connectors.
Foxconn Technology Group Chairman Terry Gou speaks during the groundbreaking ceremony for the company's headquarters in Shanghai, China, Thursday, May 10, 2012. Foxconn Technology Group, the world's biggest assembler of consumer electronics, began work Thursday on the headquarters that it says will help spearhead its efforts to sell more in the China market. (AP Photo)
ASSOCIATED PRESS Today it’s a powerhouse, a public company with revenue of over $152B in 2018. Foxconn specializes in the manufacturing of smartphones, PCs, servers, power supplies, and connectors. In addition to Apple, its top 5 customers include Dell, HP Inc., Samsung, and LG. You’ve likely used a Foxconn-manufactured product—its repertoire includes iPhones, iPods, iPads, and the Apple Watch.
The company has to be applauded for providing so much economic opportunity for 250,000 of its workers, but it’s not without controversy. It has suffered from allegations of poor working conditions, with long working hours. In 2010, 14 Foxconn employees committed suicide, a spate that was attributed to at the company’s high-pressure, exploitative work environment (read an excerpt from Brian Merchant’s The One Device: The Secret History of the iPhone , published by The Guardian here ). Apple vowed to investigate the manufacturer, with Tim Cook reportedly meeting with suicide-prevention experts and top Foxconn management in 2011. Ultimately Apple decided to maintain the working relationship.
The company also recently drew headlines (many negative) over its plans to build a manufacturing hub in Wisconsin, incentivized by the largest public subsidy package ever granted to a foreign company by the U.S—approximately $4.5B worth of incentives. Foxconn initially promised to provide as many as 13,000 well-paid jobs by 2022, an economic impact that was thrown into doubt by reports that Foxconn was considering cutting manufacturing and utilizing the Wisconsin facility solely for R&D (Bloomberg recently published a scathing report on the deal here , if interested in reading more). Recently, according to CNN , Foxconn walked back earlier reports and said that it would, in fact, utilize the Wisconsin facility for manufacturing, though it remains unclear how many jobs would fit under that umbrella versus R&D and knowledge worker roles.
Foxconn is the giant in the industry, and I feel it’s safe to say was built, in part, by Apple. I worked at Compaq with Dan Riccio, a Compaq mechanical engineer at the time, now Apple’s head of Hardware, who I know knew Gou and worked with Foxconn.
Wistron, $29B revenue
Next is Wistron, another Taiwan-based manufacturer of computer and consumer electronics products. Wistron got its start as the manufacturing branch of Acer, spinning off of the PC maker back in 2000. Its lines of business include notebook and desktop PCs, server and storage systems, handheld devices, and various networking and communication products, but it’s best known as one of the world’s largest manufacturer of notebook computers. Its big-name partnerships include Apple, Microsoft, Dell, Hewlett Packard, and, of course, Acer.

BLOOMBERG NEWS Wistron is a publicly traded company that, as of 2018, employs 83,000 people worldwide, in manufacturing and support centers across China, Malaysia, Mexico, the Czech Republic, and the United States. In 2018, Wistron raked in revenue of $28.9B with gross profits near $1.21B.
Wistron was in the news Friday in Patently Apple regarding the Indian government suspending Apple’s import permit asking the question, “Did Wistron or another Apple supplier try to hide their non-compliance with e-waste rules?” Being a global smartphone/PC ODM is tough.
Pegatron, $44B
This brings us to Pegatron, also headquartered in Taiwan. Pegatron began its journey as the production arm of ASUSTek Computer (also known as ASUS), spinning off in 2008. ASUS, for that matter, still holds roughly 17% of the company’s shares. Pegatron specializes in the manufacturing of desktop and notebook PCs, wireless systems, motherboards, game consoles, smartphones, and TVs, and boasts both Apple and HP as its biggest customers. The iPhone 4 and iPhone 5c were both manufactured by Pegatron.

© 2016 Bloomberg Finance LP As of 2018, Pegatron employs roughly 90,000 people worldwide, in Taiwan, the Czech Republic, China, Mexico, Japan, and the United States. In 2018, it pulled in a revenue of $44.43B with profits of $1.29B. Like Foxconn, Pegatron has also come under scrutiny in the past for worker conditions at its factories near Shanghai, which manufacture Apple products (see the BBC’s undercover report here ). In 2016, Bloomberg got a tour of the factory and reported that “Pegatron and Apple adopted new procedures to keep iPhone assemblers from amassing excessive overtime.”
Pegatron recently signed onto Apple’s “commitment to run their Apple production on 100 percent clean energy.”
Compal, $32B revenue
Lastly, let’s talk about Compal. The smallest of these 4 ODMs, Compal is also located in Taiwan and employs roughly 64,000 people. It was founded in 1984 and is known primarily for manufacturing notebooks, mobile devices, connected devices, liquid crystal displays, and health care products. Compal is purportedly in the midst of trying to expand beyond its primary PC business, dipping its toes into the mobile device and industrial computer sectors, according to Nikkei Asian Review.
The exterior of the Compal electronics, Inc.â€™s headquarters is seen in Taipei, Taiwan on Monday, October 23, 2006. Compal Electronics Inc., the world's second-largest maker of notebook computers, reported a 2 percent drop in third-quarter profit on price declines and losses at its flat-screen and telecommunications investments. Photographer: Maurice Tsai/Bloomberg News
BLOOMBERG NEWS Compal is responsible for the manufacturing of many products you may have used at some point—Amazon Alexa, Dell and Lenovo PCs, Apple iPads, HTC, and Sony smartphones. Compal brought in $32.09B in revenue in 2018, with profits of $987.67M. The company’s main manufacturing plant is in China, and, in addition to its headquarters in Taipei, it has offices across South Korea, the UK, the United States, and China.
Wrapping up
Hopefully, these Apple iPhone ODM profiles will serve as useful background information on some of the lesser-known players in the larger Apple-Qualcomm feud, which is set to reach a crescendo in the coming weeks. The net-net, Apple’s top 4 iPhone smartphone ODMs are very large and sophisticated companies, driving $260B in revenue, are based in Taiwan, do most of their manufacturing in China, employing half a million people. Keep that in mind as you follow along with the trial the next six weeks. I will be following the trial with interest—stay tuned for further coverage.

Blackpink Joins BTS In Accomplishing This Chart Feat,www.forbes.com,Hugh McIntyre,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/04/13/x-blackpink-joins-bts-in-accomplishing-this-chart-feat/,"It’s been less than two years since K-pop group Blackpink released their first proper collection of tunes, a self-titled EP that featured a number of songs that quickly made them stars in the genre, and in that time, they have worked incredibly hard. The all-female quartet has released a trio of EPs and a full-length album throughout their career, and now, with their latest short project, they’ve made history in one of the largest music markets in the world. Upon the arrival of their new EP Kill This Love , the girl group has become just the second K-pop act in U.K. history to land inside the top 40 on the all-genre albums chart, according to the Official Charts Company . The five-track collection sold and streamed well enough to debut at No. 40 on the listing, giving the group their first appearance inside the region, which typically signifies titles that have been commercially successful.
Blackpink join fellow K-pop superstars BTS as the only K-pop musicians to shoot an album into the U.K.'s top 40. BTS not only made history as the first musicians working in that field to rise into the U.K.’s top 40, but they are the only one to have done so on more than one occasion. The all-male vocal group has thus far scored a top 10 with their album Love Yourself: Tear , while two other collections, Love Yourself: Answer and Love Yourself: Her , both peaked at No. 14 in the country.
Just as Blackpink joins BTS as the only K-pop acts with a top 40 album, the band they follow seem poised to score another huge success. BTS just released its new album Map of the Soul: Persona , and it is already headed toward the top of important charts all around the world.

Getty With UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker recovering from surgery, Kelvin Gastelum and Israel Adesanya face off in the co-main event of Saturday’s UFC 236 fight card. The winner of the bout will leave State Farm Arena in Atlanta with the interim middleweight title wrapped around his waist.
For Gastelum, the matchup against Adesanya might feel like a bit of a consolation prize. He was initially scheduled to face Whittaker in the main event of February’s UFC 234 fight card, but hours before that event was to take place at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, Australia, Whittaker was forced to undergo emergency surgery for an abdominal hernia and a collapsed bowel. With that, Gastelum’s first chance to become a UFC champion vanished.
Gastelum has been a member of the UFC since he won season 17 of “The Ultimate Fighter” in April 2013. He dropped to welterweight after that contest but had a difficult time making the 170-pound limit. In 2016 he made a move back to the 185-pound division and has since gone 3-1-0-1. Gastelum is currently riding a two-fight winning streak. He knocked out ex-middleweight champion Michael Bisping in November 2017 and followed that with a May 2018 split-decision win over Ronaldo “Jacare” Souza.
Adesanya has enjoyed a meteoric rise through the middleweight rankings. He joined the promotion in February 2018 with a record of 11-0. After five wins in one year, Adesanya’s record stands at a perfect 16-0. His most recent victory was a decision win over former middleweight champion Anderson Silva at UFC 234. That fight was elevated to the main event of the card after the Whittaker vs. Gastelum fight was scratched from the event. Adesanya has collected four fight-night performance bonuses during his five-fight run with the promotion.
If Adesanya triumphs at UFC 236 he will become the 10th fighter in the history of the UFC to claim a title with an unbeaten record.
The winner of this contest is expected to face Whittaker in a title unification bout sometime later this year. Whittaker has indicated that he is shooting for a return date of August.
The main event of UFC 236 is an interim lightweight title bout between featherweight champion Max Holloway and Dustin Poirier.
UFC 236 marks a significant change in how American fans can purchase pay-per-view cards. The UFC has moved all of its PPV events to ESPN+ in the States. Potential viewers are now required to have an ESPN+ subscription to purchase the event. Cable and satellite services will no longer carry the UFC OOV events. This change is something to keep in mind when looking to buy UFC 236 and future PPV cards. ESPN+ is $4.99 per month and the UFC PPV price is $59.99. Previous PPV events carried a $64.99 price tag. ESPN+ offers a one week free trial.

How P&G Ventures is Dispelling the 'Big Company' Myth,www.forbes.com,Kimberly A. Whitler,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2019/04/13/how-pg-ventures-is-dispelling-the-big-company-myth/,"Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin
P&G Ventures
Procter & Gamble Last year, I conducted an interview with CEO, Dave Morgan , who essentially suggested that the large CPG companies would struggle in a non-distribution constrained environment (i.e., Direct to Consumer). He had a provocative view. In response, I recently talked to Leigh Radford, Vice President and General Manager who heads a newer division at Procter and Gamble called P&G Ventures. Below is insight into how P&G is blending the best of big and small firms to create new, innovative business models, products and solutions for consumers.
Kimberly Whitler: What is P&G Ventures?
Leigh Radford : P&G Ventures is a startup studio designed to fuel P&G growth by creating brands and businesses to solve consumer problems in categories where P&G does not currently exist. Working internally and externally, with experts, innovators and entrepreneurs from around the world, we identify and develop technologies and business models in a fast-learning, startup-like, lean environment. We are developing a portfolio of startups focused on creating new brands and businesses in new categories to the company or to the world.
Whitler: P&G has been creating new products for over a century. At one point, I saw that the company had created 23 $1 billion brands, more than any other company in the world. First, is this true? And second, if so, why did you create P&G Ventures?
Radford : Yes, P&G has had a 180-year plus track record of being able to innovate and develop brands that become global successes. The story behind P&G Ventures shows not just how the company thinks about business management, but also about development of its people. About 3.5 years ago, P&G’s CEO at that time, A.G. Lafley, developed the idea after coming back for his second stint as CEO. Over the years, he would mentor me and talk to me about his vision for my career. One day, he came up and said “I want you to look at a couple of businesses. What would you do with them? How would you think about them?” After I reviewed the new businesses and had a discussion with him, he said that he wanted me to do “this” full-time—to essentially review and develop smaller businesses that might not meet our hurdle rates yet. Essentially to begin to incubate promising new businesses and new categories for the company. At the time, I wasn’t sure that it was what I wanted to do. When you typically think about corporate innovation centers, they are the “go to” places in the company. The challenge at P&G is that that hasn’t been the case. Most people come to P&G to run big businesses, billion-dollar businesses. Historically at P&G, the major innovation sat in the current business units. So if you develop a new brand or innovation outside of the business units, there becomes all sorts of challenges. P&G’s leadership really believed in the idea and A.G. said, “the company needs this, and this is good for you.” In true P&G leadership fashion, A.G. put me on the hot seat by asking “what needed to be true” for this to work.
I thought about it and indicated I had four key requirements that would be important to get the business going: 1) needed to recruit top talent (I needed to be able to pick and retain top talent for at least a 3.5 year period before they rotated off the business), 2) the position needed to report into the CEO and have full-line of sight to the board (sometimes corporate innovation is fleeting and this often happens if it doesn’t have appropriate sponsorship), 3) it needed to be highly visible so that it showed the company that we were committed, so I asked for a GO-based (headquarter) innovation center (now located on the 11th floor next to the executive suite), and 4) we needed the flexibility to stay out of the cross hairs of the businesses.
A.G. agreed that this made sense and so the P&G Ventures group was born. I have my own budget and a different mandate. The disruption of DTC was biting on our heels. How consumers are discovering new brands is different than how we grew up. This gives us a more nimble, agile way to get closer to the consumer. We are building a studio within P&G that is initially launching brands in DTC.
P&G Ventures
Procter & Gamble Whitler: People assume that big companies like P&G are slow. How do you create a startup-like, lean environment within a large company?
Radford : First, we have a flat organization. Our group is very senior and very lean. I needed people who had enough business experience to be able to make decisions with little oversight. I also needed a senior group who would have the confidence and skills to take smart risks. I don’t have any Assistant Brand Managers in the group—all more senior. On top of it, the team is outside facing, doing deals, and needed to be independent.
Second, we augmented our internal experience with needed skills from outside. Everything we are working on is DTC – digitally, native brands. The people with these skills are not necessarily senior folks from P&G, or frankly, senior folks from any company. We use a lot of external expertise to supplement our internal group. Also, we are now able to find Brand Managers within P&G who ran DTC businesses before coming to P&G.
Third, because we are lean, we tend to make much faster decisions than you’d think for a large company. We do the appropriate level of due diligence, but the experience of the team enables faster assessment and decision making.
Whitler : How big is your portfolio right now?
Radford : We have between 13-20 projects in our portfolio, and a lot more seedlings. The exact number is in constant flux. Every day we get data that supports passing on businesses we are evaluating, and we are in constant conversations with partners creating new businesses to be tested.
Whitler : What products and projects are you working on that you are excited about now?
Radford : As one example, Opté Precision Skincare which we debuted at CES in January. We have talked a lot about how we are partnering externally, but when we started P&G Ventures we shopped internally too to look for businesses and technologies that just didn’t fit within the business unit where they were developed. Opté is one of these finds. It’s an internally created technology that was developed over 10 years and has filed already over 40 patents. It is truly a technology breakthrough. Opté combines the best of optics, proprietary algorithms, printing technology and skincare in one device. It scans, detects and instantly visibly corrects skin tone. What we found is that women and men want to look as good as they feel, and skin tone is one of the primary factors on how we judge age, health, youthfulness and attractiveness. But current solutions to cover skin spots have trade-offs and really don’t solve the need. Opté precisely only covers the visibility of spots so the natural radiance of your skin can be revealed. Opté delivers true transformation.
Whitler : How are you marketing it?
Radford : This is an example of how differently we are approaching the business. We wanted to establish Opté as high tech and get into the conversation so we shared the technology at CES a full year before it will be available for sale. We are currently are exploring several go-to-market models and pricing options all which will have a direct-to-consumer element. It’s about learning early and learning fast. That means not having everything buttoned up.
So this provides an example of one of our new launch models. We are going small, pivoting, learning, reapplying. It’s a very different journey. Traditionally, you’d have a call center managing customer comments. Not on this business. We have all levels of leaders and functions doing the early phase of customer care. The team in charge of the startup business actually take turns taking the customer calls. This is about hearing and learning from consumers. Additionally, most of the product design and brand creative is done in-house. This is about being hands on, fast, nimble, and fluid.
Whitler : You suggested earlier that P&G isn’t good at the DTC model. How are you learning and growing in a way that benefits P&G?
Radford : This is important. One thing we are really clear about is what we are good at and what we aren’t. We are good at creating and scaling brands. We aren’t as good at building a DTC business. We just don’t have a lot of experience in DTC. Until that skill grows, I’m actively out looking externally for CEOs to spin those companies out. We haven’t finalized what the exact business relationships would be, but we believe it is a unique way to continue to grow the businesses we are developing and learn.
To help us learn in this startup-like ecosystem I created an advisory board. I brought onto the board really smart and experienced people like the CEO of Madison Reed and the former CEO of Match and current CEO of ShopRunner, among others, who are Silicon Valley founders and entrepreneurs. We also invested heavily in capability training. We brought in General Assembly, a training company that teaches practical technology skills like data analytics and SEO training so that we could continue to learn and have the skills to be more hands on. We also did an assessment of P&G Ventures' leadership team and identified ways to upskill their talents and took seven people to the Executive Digital Marketing class at Wharton. Lastly, I have been really surprised to find the generosity that exists in the startup world. It’s a lonely world because it’s hard. They all help each other. I will set up a meeting with one person and then they introduce me to four more people. It is exponential. That is the new business ecosystem. The generosity is crazy.
While Dave Morgan indicated that P&G was being challenged by DTC brands, P&G Ventures appears to be addressing this by creating a division designed to both drive innovation and thrive in the DTC space. Perhaps this nearly 200-year-old company is more agile than some think.

Getty Max Holloway looks to join the small group of two-division UFC champions on Saturday when he faces Dustin Poirier in the main event of UFC 236.
Holloway, who currently holds the UFC featherweight title, moves up to lightweight for the first time in his UFC career to face Poirier. The winner will leave State Farm Arena in Atlanta with the interim lightweight title strap.
The bout marks the second meeting between these two. Their first fight took place on the preliminary card of UFC 143 in 2012. Poirier scored a first-round submission win over Holloway in that matchup. Holloway, who was 20 years old at the time, accepted the fight, his first with the UFC, as a late injury replacement for Ricardo Lamas. Poirier, who was 23 at the time the two first faced off, extended his winning streak to five straight with his win over Holloway.
Since that first meeting, the two men have steadily climbed the UFC rankings by always looking to test themselves against top-level competition. Neither fighter has taken a shortcut or relied on anything but their abilities inside the octagon to get them to where they are today.
Holloway is currently 16-4 with the UFC and riding a 13-fight winning streak. During his seven-year run with the promotion, Holloway has established himself as one of the most offensively-minded fighters in the UFC. His resume is an impressive one. Holloway has the most wins in UFC featherweight history with 15. His ten stoppage wins (eight knockouts) are the most in the history of the UFC’s 145-pound division. No UFC fighter has landed as many significant strikes as Holloway has with 1,627. And those are just some of the statistical highlights from Holloway’s time with the UFC. Holloway’s four most recent bouts have all been title fights, he’s won each of those outings by knockout.
Poirier’s resume might not be as flashy as Holloway’s, but he is on an impressive run. Since moving to lightweight in 2015, Poirier has gone 8-1-0-1. He is currently on a three-fight winning streak. Each of those victories, which all came by way of stoppage, were against former lightweight champions. Two of those men, Eddie Alvarez and Anthony Pettis, held UFC gold, while the third, Justin Gaethje, was a World Series of Fighting kingpin.
The UFC elected to reward an interim 155-pound title because UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov is serving a suspension tied to the brawl that broke out after his UFC 229 submission victory over Conor McGregor.
UFC 236 marks a significant change in how American fans can purchase pay-per-view cards. The UFC has moved all of its PPV events to ESPN+ in the States. Potential viewers are now required to have an ESPN+ subscription to purchase the event. Cable and satellite services will no longer carry the UFC OOV events.

How Social Media Over-Sharing About Your Child Can Cause Irrevocable Harm,www.forbes.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2019/04/12/how-social-media-over-sharing-about-your-child-can-cause-irrevocable-harm/,"Part of the series “Parenting for Success” Social media posts from parents can hurt their children
Photo: iStock If you’re on social media, you’re most likely bombarded every single day with an onslaught of social media updates about people’s daily lives. Many of these are from parents who may be potentially well-meaning but are engaged in extreme over-sharing about their children’s every move. It’s clear that many parents don’t have an effective filter regarding what is appropriate, healthy and beneficial to share, versus information that will be harmful to the child now and in later life.
Thousands of parents have not been trained properly about appropriate and healthy boundaries or the potential danger of chronic over-sharing of private material regarding their children. And often, parents who engage in this behavior are doing so to soothe their own fears, insecurities and anxieties, and don’t see how damaging it will be to their children over time.
One of the most helpful principles I learned as a marriage and family therapist was that there are certain types of personal information that are beneficial to share with our clients to help them grow, but there are other types of information that should never be shared.
A key principle that parents can learn from the therapist’s code of conduct is this:
If the information you’re sharing is all about you and how you feel (to make yourself feel better or alleviate your own stress and anxiety) rather than about helping your client (or in this case, your child) grow and thrive, then you need to seriously rethink (or stop) your personal sharing.
To learn more about how parents are unwittingly hurting their children with their social media shares, I caught up this week with Andrew Wittman , author of the new book Seven Secrets of Resilience for Parents: Navigating the Stress of Parenthood . As a former marine, police officer and special agent, Wittman is the Founder and CEO of the Mental Toughness Training Center , an organization that teaches everyone from Fortune 500 Executives to parents and even teens how to resolve conflict, deal with pressure, foster healthy team dynamics, and increase mental stamina to help them achieve their biggest goals in life. Wittman has been interviewed by Business Insider, MarketWatch, Men’s Journal, Men’s Health, Hallmark’s Home & Family, The Wall Street Journal and more about developing mental strength and parenting considerations regarding their over-exposure of their children’s lives and activities on social media and how to stop it.
Here’s what Wittman shares:
Kathy Caprino: Andrew, what can you tell us more about how certain public posts about our children negatively impact their self-esteem?
Andrew Wittman: As parents, we owe it to our children to be critical thinkers concerning what we’re about to post, not just a post directly about the child but also take into account how what is being posted reflects on the entire family.
Embarrassing or spotlighting your child can cause them to be more self-conscious, or worse, become recipients of cyberbullying. A Pew Research Center survey finds that 59% U.S. teens have been on the receiving end of abusive behavior online. The top two categories of cyberbullying come in the form of name-calling and spreading rumors. Painting your child or your family in a light that spawns ridicule is obviously something to be avoided.
But equally destructive is the pressure for your kids to constantly perform and be perfect. This problem is amplified when social media is added to the mix. Are your relentless parental pride posts detrimental to your child? Research suggests this is so , as these posts are adding to your child’s anxiety to be perfect and measure up. The bottom line is that you need to assess whether you are posting to help your child’s self-esteem or your own. If it’s about you, don’t post it. If it truly is about increasing your child’s self-esteem, they will like that it was posted too.
Caprino: Are you seeing that parents are generally too liberal with what they share?
Wittman: Many parents seem to have a default mode of posting in-detail about everything from their baby’s delivery to the child’s latest bought with a gastrointestinal virus. This is backward. The default mode should be this:
Everything should remain private until we go through the process of vetting what should be posted.
Further, some things should be more exclusive and selective–for sharing with the grandparents, for example. This goes beyond the realm of data breaches by broadcasting you or your child’s personal data. That should be obvious to parents in this era. We tend not think as much about the con artist, predators and even the unscrupulous authority figures. Unfortunately, even our most trusted advisors can be bad actors. We forget what we posted, but the master manipulator has not and will weaponize your posts.
During the Korean War, Chinese intelligence officers would clip and file thousands of hometown newspaper announcements for weddings, obituaries, graduations, etc. called open-source intelligence . These were essentially old school social media posts. They saved the articles in case they ever captured an American serviceman and could use the personal information to manipulate and psychologically torture the POWs. Now, it’s so much easier to catalogue that personal information when parents are serving it up like an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Caprino: Should parents always ask their teenager first, before they post about them?
Wittman: This is simple courtesy and serves as a conduit for open communication with your teenager. Even more vital to understand the connection between teenage suicide rates and social media usage. Not only is cyberbullying an issue, but so is the pressure to look perfect all the time across all social media platforms.
Teenagers aren’t just connecting and communicating with their friends—they are playing a role in the reality show that is their online life. I’m not saying it’s right or it’s wrong. It just is. While research is still in the early stages , let’s not wait until we irrefutable proof before we take preventative action. That’s how the tobacco industry spun the early research and way too many people died before the data was irrefutable. As parents, we must realize smartphones and social media platforms aren’t simply the new version of rock ‘n’ roll. These two things can be weaponized instantly and on a large scale and things can go viral at any time.
Caprino: What if the child is just a toddler? Are there any good ground rules here?
Wittman: Yes. Even if it’s 100% cute, ask yourself, “what are the long-term consequences for my child if this goes viral?” Decide whether the post has the possibility of branding your child in a way that they might resent ten years down the road.
I like to remind myself that, as a public figure, I chose to put myself out there, but my kids didn’t make that choice and I’m not going to force it on them. It may not cross your mind, while you’re posting that picture of little Suzie naked in the bathtub but soon enough, she’ll have to deal with you making that picture public.
Taking the picture and putting it in a scrap book in the closet is not the same thing as posting it online. There is almost no upside to posting pictures of your child openly on social media. Interestingly, when I say that, I get massive pushback from parents about how stupid that statement is. However, when I ask them what the upside reasons are for posting, I get a lot of stammering, huffing, puffing and folks stomp off. If you don’t have solid upside reasons for posting, chances are that your post is more about you than the child.
Caprino: What questions should parents ask themselves before posting about their kids?
Wittman: A productive questioning process around this starts with questions framed with words like “What is ___?” or “How can I____?"" These questions start the genius problem-solving part of our brains into action. Remember that once something enters the social media ether it’s there forever, so parents would greatly benefit by taking a few seconds before posting about their kids and ask themselves a series of good and better questions to determine if a public post should be made.
Start with these:
What are my real reasons for posting this? What is it that I’m trying to achieve or get by sharing this? What’s my target? Does posting this help me or hurt me in accomplishing my target? How would sharing this affect my child now and in the future? How can I better share this and be more selective, sharing with only the relevant people in my child’s life?
Caprino: Why do you think that parents are so driven to share all this private information so publicly? What are they trying to achieve or get out of it?
Wittman: Finally, we get to the underlying and root cause of the social media issue. We have all seen the “sideline” mom or dad at the little league sporting events. You know the crazy, out-of-control parent screaming at their kid on the field, screaming at the coaches, screaming at the refs and then when the game is over, and belittle their child’s performance in front of everyone if they didn’t measure up or over-celebrate if their little dumpling is the star. The parents, who were not stars, are living vicariously through their children and pressuring them to succeed.
Many parents are bragging to show the world how awesome a parent they must be because their child is so successful. Left unchecked, this mindset metastasizes into the college entrance bribery scandal. Parents bribing and cheating for their kids so the parents can brag about the great school the child got accepted into. This is the biggest insult to your child possible. It screams out to them that you don’t believe in them and that their own accomplishments are not enough. That they don’t measure up to your social media branding standard.
Don’t doubt for a second that those parents posted all over the social media realms how their little angel was going to one of the most prestigious schools in the country. It’s more about the parents feeling good about themselves than the achievements of the children.

3 Value Stocks In The Insurance Sector Now Hitting 2019 Highs,www.forbes.com,John Navin,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnavin/2019/04/13/3-value-stocks-in-the-insurance-sector-now-hitting-2019-highs/,"Share to linkedin Getty Insurance value stocks making new highs for 2019: all 3 of these can be called ""value"" because of their low price/earnings ratios and because they trade below book. That's the beginning of the classic approach to identifying value as described by Warren Buffett's mentor at Columbia University, Benjamin Graham.
You can read about this type of approach in his book, Security Analysis , or in the much more direct version, The Intelligent Investor . My screen for these only includes those with a steady stream of earnings, which are paying regular dividends and where debt does not reasonably constitute a threat to long-term viability.
Here's what came up after markets closed for the week:
AXA Equitable Holdings, Inc. trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EQH. The insurance broker, based in New York City, was established in 1859. AXA Equitable Holdings, Inc. daily price chart. stockcharts.com
The stock's price/earnings ratio sits at 6.9 -- this, at a time when the current p/e of the S&P 500 has reached 21.7. AXA Equitable Holdings now trades at a 13% discount to its book value.
Earnings over the last year have been excellent and the 5-year record of earnings is positive as well. Right now, long-term debt slightly exceeds shareholder equity, a concern. The company pays a 2.33% dividend.
AXA Equitable has moved from 15 at the Christmas Eve, 2018 low to its present price of 22. That's about a 50% gain in a very short period of time, not the kind of move you might typically expect in a low p/e stock in the insurance business.
Lincoln National Corporation is Radnor, Pennsylvania headquartered and trades on the New York Stock Exchange. According to the company's website , they've been around since 1905. Lincoln National Corporation daily price chart. stockcharts.com
You can buy a share of the company today at a 4% discount to book value. The price/earnings ratio is down there at 8.77. Lincoln's long-term debt is exceeded by shareholder equity. The dividend yield comes to 2.28%. This last year's earnings have been quite good and the record on the 5-year time frame is positive as well.
In late December of last year, Lincoln traded as low as 48 and at the close on Friday had rocketed up to just under 65. This is an extraordinary upward move in a very short time for a staid, old insurance stock.
MetLife, Inc. is New York Stock Exchange listed and based in New York City. This is another insurance company which has been around for awhile -- their website says 145 years. MetLife daily price chart. stockcharts.com
This well-known insurance company can be purchased for 85% of its book value. The price/earnings ratio is a meager 9.29. The earnings record is positive for this last year and also looks good on the 5-year view. MetLife pays a 3.66% dividend. Shareholder equity is greater than long-term debt. The stock hit as low as 39 late last year and now trades at about 46.
It's peculiar to see these old school value stocks in this typically sleepy sector moving up so quickly. It's almost as if something unusual is up.
I do not hold positions in these investments. No recommendations are made one way or the other. If you're an investor, you'd want to look much deeper into each of these situations. You can lose money trading or investing in stocks and other instruments. Always do your own independent research, due diligence and seek professional advice from a licensed investment advisor.

Twitter Versus Facebook: Why Selling Access Is Better Than Selling Data,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/04/13/twitter-versus-facebook-why-selling-access-is-better-than-selling-data/,"Facebook has gone to great lengths over the past year attempting to convince a skeptical public and increasingly antagonistic policymakers that it does not sell its users’ data. Instead, the company notes that it merely sells access to its users through ads and acts as a conduit through which others harvest data, but that it itself does not receive a check in return for handing over ZIP files of data. In contrast, Twitter quite literally does sell its users’ data in the form of a series of commercial data feeds that have become the basis of modern social media data mining. The differences in these approaches remind us why Facebook’s model of selling access is far more lucrative than Twitter’s model of selling data. Facebook and Twitter represent the opposite extremes of the social media revolution.
Facebook focused on connecting friends, neighbors and family together through privacy-controlled communications and sharing. Its platform was designed to connect individuals and small groups. Revenue was generated through advertising. Data could be mass harvested in ways that reinforced Facebook’s centrality to the global communications network.
In contrast, Twitter focused on being a broadcast platform akin to a realtime news outlet, with posts being world-readable by default. Its platform was designed to connect individuals to the planet itself. Revenue was generated through both advertising and selling packaged streams of the totality of all public posts in realtime to companies all across the world. Data could be purchased en masse or downloaded for free via a 1% sample stream.
Facebook’s decision to hoard its data rather than box it up and sell live access like Twitter has meant that it alone holds the keys to its vast data treasury. In fact, most of its privacy woes like Cambridge Analytica revolve around its decision to look the other way as third parties harvested data from its servers for their own use.
Twitter’s decision to sell its data means that companies all across the globe have mirrors of Twitter’s archives and researchers and companies all across the world buy, barter and share a large fraction of its trillion tweets every day.
Facebook saw itself early on as a service provider, building up a vast archive of intimate user data that it could charge for access to through advertisements. Twitter saw itself in the role of China’s early manufacturing persona: the low-cost plumbing of the internet for others to build products around and sell high-margin services on top of. While China eventually began a transition towards the services industry, Twitter seems stuck, mired in its utilities legacy.
By restricting access to its data, Facebook was able to enforce a monopoly on access to its user data, ensuring it alone could offer lucrative services on top of those riches.
In contrast, by selling its data directly, Twitter relegated itself to the low-profit business of data vendor, allowing other companies to reap the vast service industry profits.
Imagine if instead of selling its data, Twitter had built its own social media analytics platform from the very beginning. Instead of customers purchasing services from the tens of thousands of companies that offer various forms of social analytics today, Twitter would be the one with millions of customers all purchasing access to its global social analytics service at whatever cost it wished to charge.
Facebook’s refusal to sell its data also means we have precious few insights into just how big or small its platform really is. Only through its recent academic research collaboration are we gaining our first insights into the size of its data archives and Facebook is turning out to be vastly smaller than we’ve been led to believe.
In contrast, Twitter’s downloadable firehose means we can actually analyze its entire platform at scale to precisely chart its entire evolution over its existence.
Putting this all together, Facebook’s decision to sell access rather than data means it not only has a monopoly over offering high-value services around its user data, but it can prevent outsiders from actually verifying its claims about the size of its data archives or their limitations. Twitter, on the other hand, has been relegated to simple utilities provider, leaving the high-margin services business to others, while its open book archives mean its collapsing user numbers, aging user base, skyrocketing retweet rate, cessation of large-scale precision geotagging and other ailments are all on display.
In the end, the Facebook versus Twitter battle reminds us that it is far better financially to sell access through ads than to sell data."

Leaders: For Staff Appreciation Don't Forget The Little Things,www.forbes.com,Joyce E. A. Russell,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joyceearussell/2019/04/13/leaders-for-staff-appreciation-dont-forget-the-little-things/,"It’s amazing how much the little things can matter to our employees. Taking the time to say hi to them by name, asking about their children, listening when they tell you about a project they are working on, among other things. As leaders, we can be so busy accomplishing things or running to meetings, that we may rush right by our staff without taking the time to stop and spend those few minutes touching base. But those few minutes can mean a lot to our staff and to our relationships. Staff are the backbone of our organizations. They often are the ones who come in early, stay late and help to train others even when it’s not part of their job. They are the organizational citizens who do all those extra things that aren’t part of their job description but we all know need to be done. What are we doing as leaders to let them know they are valued? Are we waiting until review time to thank them or are we using those brief moments each day to share a kind word or spending some time getting to know them?
When coaching hundreds of executives over the years, I have often told them that just because recognition is not important to them personally, it does not mean it is not important to others. To be a successful leader, we have to discover what is valued by our employees. Is it more money, better offices, flex time, casual dress, recognition, etc? What is most important to them (not us)? And, then we need to follow up and give them the things that they value if possible. But let’s not forget the little things. In addition to merit increases and promotions and exciting new opportunities, let’s take those moments each day to build meaningful relationships with our staff.
The month of April has Administrative Professionals Day (formerly National Secretaries Day) on the last Wednesday of the month. Let’s not forget that day or that week. Use it as one opportunity to thank the staff that do so much to make our lives easier. Some ideas that might be valued by them include:
Flowers Lunch or breakfast Handwritten notes (these carry more weight than emails since staff often save them and display them on their desks) Professional development opportunities (providing reimbursements, travel stipends, etc) Spot bonuses Time off (even a few hours to be able to leave early can make a difference) Gift cards for them and/or their family (to thank their family for all the time the staff member puts in at the office and is away from home) Bring in services they might enjoy (mindfulness seminars, neck massages, etc) There are countless ways to let your staff know they are personally valued by you. If you're not sure what your staff would appreciate, then it’s probably time to get to know them better and ask them. While it's important to do the big things like promotions, raises, more vacation, etc. for our staff, it's also valuable to remember the little things that can make everyone feel valued and included as part of the team."
Four Questions You Should Immediately Stop Asking Yourself,www.forbes.com,Entrepreneurs Organization,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/entrepreneursorganization/2019/04/13/four-questions-you-should-immediately-stop-asking-yourself/,"Post written by Ryan Avery Ryan Avery is one of the most profound keynote speakers on strategic communication, negotiation and leadership. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin Big dreams. Solid goals. A vision for the future. Many of us hit the first few months of the year with high hopes and big ideas for breakthrough results. The one piece that historically sabotages our forward trajectory, however, is the conversations we have with ourselves.
I’m a man of big dreams with a solid “can-do” attitude. Yet, despite having every reason in the world to feel on top of the world, there are times when I struggle with self-doubt and that nagging “imposter” feeling that plagues so many people. I can get overwhelmed when confronted by a wide spectrum of options and can find myself sometimes shutting down rather than powering up to meet the challenge.
So, how do we interrupt the struggle? How do we get to the place of feeling more genuine and authentic in our purpose and actions and less plagued by self-defeating thoughts of “not good enough?”
Start by being kinder to yourself. Speak to yourself at least as kindly as you would a friend or co-worker. Imagine saying some of the things you’ve said to yourself to another human being. You wouldn’t, right? So, stop saying them to yourself! Secondly, be more strategic with the questions you ask yourself. Unsplash Questions are gateways to answers – whether they are positive or negative. It is important to think about how we pose those questions.
Over the last several years, I’ve been on the journey of personal development that began by removing the four questions below from my daily conversation. The impact has been immense. I’d like to share them with you. How much money do I make?
Who cares? The more important question is, “How much money do I keep?” The world is filled with “poor” millionaires; those people who make a lot of money but don’t have a lot of money. “How much do I keep?” is the question we should be proud to answer on our path to success. If you are making $90,000 a year and spending every dime of it, that’s not growth.
Ask yourself, “What can I do to keep more and spend less?” Strategists tell us to keep and invest 10-20% of our annual income. When you’re ready to move your life in a more successful direction, stop asking the short-term questions like, “How much do I make?” Start asking yourself how much more you can keep, then start taking action on your answers. How many books do I read?
Again, who cares? I know people who read 50+ a year. In fact, I used to be one of them. Instead of focusing on a tally number you can brag about at a dinner party, ask yourself, “How much do I retain and implement?” I now focus on the three or four extraordinary books each year that I can read and pull incredible strategies from to transform my life, my business, or amplify the lessons that I teach to my audiences. The more empowering question would be, “What three books can I read this year that will be transformational for me personally, professionally, or both?” Find that answer, and you’re on your way! How much do I weigh?
I can hear some people saying, “Ryan, how is this question related to business?” and it is one of my strongest beliefs that self-image determines your personal and professional outcomes. If you are riddled with self-doubt and loathing when you look in the mirror, how can you possibly bring your best self to your business and relationships?
Stop obsessing over the daily scale number, change the conversation in your head, and start tapping into how you physically feel. Start making shifts to your diet. When you eat a meal, does it make you feel better or worse? Does it give you energy or make you feel lethargic? When you increase your water intake and decrease your sugar consumption, do you feel better or worse? Pay attention to what your body is telling you as you move more and sit less. Our worth and contribution to the world around us is not anchored in any number on any scale. Stop giving your weight the keys to the kingdom and start focusing on the daily proactive measures you can take to feel at your best. How can I stop procrastinating?
Guilty. This is one I’ve struggled with – hard. I used to consider myself the king of procrastination – and because of that I felt weighed down with the guilt that came with that crown. The game-changer for me was when I shifted my question to, “What ONE thing can I do right now?” For me, it eliminates the pressure and compels me to act. Even if it is one small step, it is still a step in the right direction.
This is how you go from this year being “a” year to THE year to grow personally and professionally and live more abundantly and joyfully. The place to start is with the person in the mirror and the questions we are asking ourselves.
Make the change from…
How much do I make to… How much will I keep?
How many books I’ve read to… How many books can I put into action this year?
How much do I weigh to… How do I feel today?
Why am I always procrastinating to… What is the one thing I can do right now?
Shift the daily dialogue you have with yourself. Make your questions way less damning and way more strategic and mindful. When you do, the results may surprise you. Then they’ll delight you. Then, you’ll begin to have fun asking questions again, because you will know they are in direct correlation with the direction of your dreams.

"Why 8,000 Is The Most Important Number For Your Retirement Plan",www.forbes.com,Joseph Coughlin,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephcoughlin/2019/04/13/why-8000-is-the-most-important-number-for-your-retirement-plan/,"My Uber driver and I struck up a conversation about the Orlando traffic and weather. The chatter soon drifted into stories about his experiences living and driving in Florida. I soon learned my driver’s name was Bob. Raising his voice, and turning to get a look at my face in his rearview mirror, Bob asked me, “How old do you think I am?”
I am always nervous to make such a guess — uttering a number either too old or too young can chill the air.
But, before I could make a guess, Bob volunteered his age with a wry smile, “I am 81 years old and still working! Heck of a thing, don’t you think? 81, and still working.”
Bob’s voice trailed off, as he gently turned the wheel steering his Camry off the highway into the driveway of my hotel. At a volume almost too low to be heard, he muttered, “I had no idea it would be so long.”
“What’s that?” I asked.
Bob’s eyes darted to the rearview mirror again staring back at me. He replied flatly. “Retirement.”
Bob and millions of others are experiencing the new retirement. Yes, there have always been older people, and millions have retired before us, but retirement today is different.
There are many factors that can describe how life in retirement has changed. But perhaps the biggest difference is time.
Social Security was enacted in 1935. More than an entitlement program, Social Security culturally framed how we think about retirement — particularly when to retire. While the ""when"" of retirement, 65 years old, was simply a product of legislative negotiation, the number is now engraved into our social consciousness with nearly the same indisputable truth as Newton’s law of gravity. In the 1930s retirement was a story about a brief period of life that offered much-needed rest from a life of work. As I observe in my book, The Longevity Economy , shortly after World War II, with the advent of pensions, social security, and modestly longer life, the retirement story framed older age as a short time filled with well earned relaxation, leisure, and family.
But, as my 81-year old driver keenly observed, retirement is very likely to be longer than planned and include more than simply play and rest. According to the Social Security Administration , an American male at 65 years old is likely to live an average of another 20 years. Likewise, an American woman, on average, is likely to live approximately another nearly 22 years.
Numbers alone, such as the cold clarity of 20 years, rarely provide insight. Instead, stories that explain what the numbers may mean can give context and inspiration to comprehensive retirement planning. So how might the 20-plus years in retirement be imagined?
Translating years to days, two-plus decades of retirement is about 8,000 days. 8,000 days is also roughly the same amount of time from birth to legal drinking age – 21 years old. Put another way, life between 21 years old and what many might call midlife in their later 40s, is another 8,000 days. And, from midlife, to the seemingly preordained retirement age of 65 years old, is – you guessed it – about another 8,000 days.
The point is retirement is not a brief period of life after full-time work. Rather, retirement is equal to one-third of your adult life.
Moreover, life in retirement is equal to other major life stages that benefitted from countless people, institutions, media, advertising, social norms, and more that guided how you lived in, and moved from, one phase of life to another. And during each of those 8,000-day periods there were many transitions as well as planned and unplanned events that punctuated life.
Unlike other life stages, there are far fewer guideposts to help navigate the later one third of adult life. Images of golf courses, bike trails, cafés, beaches and other trite imagery often found in retirement brochures may provide dreams and inspiration to some, but 8,000 days sitting at a café is not realistic for most. And not even desirable for many. Why should we assume that retirement, another 8,000 days of adult life, should be somehow more predictable, or any less filled with transitions, celebrations, and revelations, than any other life stage?
Viewing retirement as a full, long 8,000 days stimulates the imagination and raises many questions about later life.
There is the seemingly singular retirement planning question that becomes even more critical when realizing that there is the real possibility that our lifespan could outlive our wealth span. How much money will be needed, not for a brief time, but for a much longer time than most of us imagine?
Then there are the less obvious considerations that are not typically part of our retirement planning story. Here are just a few.
What will we do with all that time – work part-time, play, travel, learn something new, remarry, volunteer, provide care? Have we made the plans, and established the connections, and formed the relationships necessary to engage in those activities before punching-the-clock one last time and entering into retirement?
Where will we live? In the previous 8,000-day periods of life we may have moved at least one or more times. Why shouldn’t we assume that we might move once, twice or more in older age as our preferences, health, and perhaps finances demand?
Retirement planning for most has been about numbers – savings and the amount of money necessary to ensure financial security through the years – certainly not incorrect, but woefully incomplete. Reframing retirement for what it is, one third of adult life forces us to realize that there are far more opportunities, and challenges, than our current story of retirement planning includes.
8,000 days of retirement. As my 81-year-old driver Bob might say, “heck of a thing.”"
"Is The ""Saving For The Future Act"" Real, Or A Mirage?",www.forbes.com,Elizabeth Bauer,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ebauer/2019/04/13/is-the-saving-for-the-future-act-real-or-a-mirage/,"Going on two weeks ago by now, on April 4th , Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) introduced new legislation, the Saving for the Future Act, which proposes to take the experiments in auto-enroll IRAs undertaken at the state level in Oregon, Illinois and California, and roll it out nationally. I read through the fact sheet made available at the time as well as additional reporting by CNBC , identified a number of questions the answers to which would make a significant difference in evaluating the legislation, and waited for the text to come out. I'm still waiting . So while I'm waiting, here, at least, is the information its sponsors have provided, and the reasons why it's especially true here that the devil's in the details.
Under the proposal, all employers with more than 10 employees would be obliged to contribute a minimum amount to an employee savings/retirement plan; this would be set at 50 cents per hour worked upon implementation, then would increase to 60 cents in two years, and increase with wage growth thereafter. For businesses with fewer than 100 workers, this would take the form of contributing via payroll deduction to""UP accounts"" established on their behalf and run by the federal government. (""UP"", according to the Third Way description but not, so far as I can tell, the fact sheet itself, stands for Universal Personal.) For larger businesses, the fact sheet doesn't specify the form any such savings/retirement account would take. Employees working at the smallest firms would have the option to enroll in such accounts on their own. Also, part-time workers would be included in the program but independent contractors would participate on an individual basis only.
To partially offset the cost, employers would receive a tax credit equivalent to the cost of 50% of the minimum contribution for the first 15 workers, and 25% for the next 15. Workers participating as individuals, whether because their employers are too small to be mandated to participate, or because they are self-employed/independent contractors, would also receive this credit, up to a maximum of $1,000. To pay for these credits, the corporate tax rate would be increased from 21% to 23% and the top marginal individual income tax rate would be increased from 37% to 39.6%.
The first $2,500 in savings would be directed to a savings account; as soon as the balance exceeds this amount, additional contributions are directed to a retirement account.
Even though the employer contribution is fixed at a minimum dollar amount, workers themselves would be autoenrolled as a percent of pay, starting at 4% and increasing to 10%, with the option to opt-out or select an alternate contribution level.
Government-run ""UP Accounts"" would have maximum employee contribution levels set at half that of 401(k) plans. The accounts' administration would be contracted out to a financial services company with target date funds.
Upon retirement, participants would be able to annuitize their benefits into a lifetime benefit or an annuity-certain (say, until the Social Security Late Retirement Age), or take ""automatic, regular withdrawals equal to a certain percentage of their account balance.""
So, yes, I have questions:
The fact sheet says that employers with fewer than 100 employees would participate in the federal ""UP Account"" program. Does this mean that all employers with greater than 100 employees will be required to offer a retirement account from among the ""menu"" of retirement accounts now on offer, which means, by and large, a 401(k) account? Would this legislation simultaneously amend 401(k)-related laws to permit the structure of directing the first $2,500 to a savings account (known in the expert jargon as a ""sidecar"" account and only in existence now in a sort of jury-rigged format until legislation formalizes their structure )? Would self-employed workers be able to collect the $500 credit without participating in the ""UP Account"" system, but retaining an IRA instead?
In either the fed-administered or the employer-run version, what would the tax treatment be of this emergency fund? Would the overall retirement savings fund function like a traditional or a Roth IRA, or would participants be able to choose?
Would there be requirements for demonstrating hardship in order to withdraw from the savings account or are the reasons specified (car accident, family leave) merely examples? How quickly could they withdraw the cash? Would the savings account portion of the program be invested in a risk-free manner?
What would the administrative costs of such a plan be, and who would pay for them? Would the government provide start-up funding or expect the administrative services provider to swallow the initial costs? Would there be an expense load applied to the savings account that, at today's low interest rates, might be greater than the interest earned? How expensive is it to manage the accounts of people working few hours or entering and leaving the workforce often? How would the management company's expense charges be monitored?
Would participants receive any guidance on how to decide how much to save, especially those who are low-income and struggling simply to stay out of debt? How easy would it be for them to opt out or change their contribution rates?
Would the annuities for plan draw-down be private-sector or underwritten by the federal government? If the latter, how would the amounts be determined? Would participants be locked into these restricted account-withdrawal formats rather than taking larger lump-sums? Would this be true only of ""UP Accounts"" or would restrictions apply to the new retirement savings that larger employers will be mandated to provide?
What does the overall system cost look like in dollar amounts? How much is due to the tax credits to employers (which strike me as a bit peculiar when the system functions as, essentially, a mandated wage hike, and yet proponents of actual minimum wage hikes show no similar interest in the effect on employers) and how much due to the $500 credits to individual contractors/the self-employed?
This all seems like nit-picking but it's not.
The bottom line is this: the hope of making it easier for Americans to save for emergencies and for retirement is a worthy one. But there are so many ways it can go sideways that it's really just not enough to say ""we have good and worthy intentions and the details will all sort themselves out one way or another."" The details actually make a significant impact and have to be cared about sooner rather than later.

10 Years In The Game: Tips From A Beauty Entrepreneur Who Pioneered A Movement And Created An Empire,www.forbes.com,Danielle Hughes,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellehughes/2019/04/13/10-years-in-the-game-tips-from-a-beauty-entrepreneur-who-pioneered-a-movement-and-created-an-empire/,"As a 22-year-old struggling college student, Rochelle Graham-Campbell, now founder of million dollar beauty brand, Alikay Naturals, says she had one secret weapon: YouTube. Rochelle paved the way as one of the first natural hair vloggers. After launching her channel back in 2008 – she would go on to amass an enormous following – currently over 100,000. At that point, she decided that it was time to turn her followers into dollars. Her brand, Alikay Naturals, is now one of the most sought after natural hair care brands with recent launches in Target, Walmart and CVS stores nationwide. In addition, the brand is sold in several independent retail locations across the globe including Jamaica, France and the United Kingdom.
Holding a firm passion to molding more self made multi-million dollar beauty brands in untapped markets, she is using her platform to educate 100 women through her newest venture.
I got a chance to chat with Rochelle as she provided tips for current and emerging entrepreneurs commemorating her 10 years in business; ranging from self-financing, effective branding, scaling and motherhood.
From blogger to brand: I was heading to law school and that was my plan after college. My life just happened to shift. One of the things that I look back on is how God has ordered my steps. I enjoy teaching people things that I know to help them avoid making the mistakes that I’ve made. My first 400 videos on YouTube, I did for free. This was way before YouTube was paying people for videos. I did it because I loved it. It was a passion of mine and I enjoyed it. It developed from me being a blogger to now creating solutions for my followers with products. I did it to help and to serve others. My life is living in service and that is how that transition happened for me. I still get to serve but now it’s on a different scale.
On building and managing your investment: You have to make sure that you’re very clear with what your goals are so that you know exactly what you’re trying to accomplish. Also, making sure that you’re doing the proper research no matter what you’re investing in. Keep in mind that there are going to be risks and everything isn’t for everyone. You want to learn to manage your expectations as well – specifically as it relates to financial investments – those things take time.
Finding your niche and expertise: Start with what you’re passionate about. It all starts with what you actually enjoy doing, what you’re good at and realizing that you won’t be able to service everyone. Sometimes when people hear the word ‘niche’ they think that it’s a bad thing, but, having a niche can really help you grow, especially if you’re in a space that a lot of people are not catering to. Start with what your passionate about. When you’re growing a brand or building a business you will find times where you are not always profitable especially in the beginning, so, when you genuinely love and enjoy what you do it makes it easier to push through.
Launching and scaling: One of the things I’m working on is launching my brand, Mogul University, because I want to teach people how to build the foundation for strong businesses. I think back in the day everyone focused on the hard work and building brick by brick, which isn’t always the fun stuff. Nowadays, people only like focusing on branding their business and the pretty aesthetics when in reality they haven’t done the behind the scenes work first. As far as scaling – understand that it is part of your growth. If you are not scaling then you’re suffocating . My business is currently in one of the biggest scaling phases that we’ve ever experienced especially coming up on 10 years. As a business owner, you have to clearly identify when you’re at that point and work quickly to make sure that you break through that ceiling or your business will suffocate and die.
Branding to your tribe of consumers: Your consumers will always be able to show you what they want. Once you are figuring out what your brand is and what your brand is going to incorporate – throw things out there that you think they may like and pay very close attention to what your tribe is reacting to. They will tell you by their reactions what they want to see more of! As business owners, it is our job is to pay attention to our tribe of consumers and react accordingly. If there is something that you really enjoy doing and your audience isn’t really into it then you may need to scale that back and focus on things that are actually giving you movement for your brand to propel forward.
Bootstrapping your business: My company is coming up on our ten-year anniversary in July and we are still a bootstrapped business! We started with a $100 investment and we have used that to continuously feed our company. To this day, we don’t have any investors, loans or credit cards. We are simply growing and running our business based on the revenue that we are generating. Now, when you are bootstrapping your business, I am not going to say that it’s going to be easy. You must be extremely cautious and you have to be more calculated than your competitors. As a bootstrapped business, from a financial standpoint, you may not be able to afford the same types of mistakes that they’ve made because they have an abundance of funding. You have to think more strategically. You have to make sure that every step and every dollar that you spend makes sense and has a return. The good part about bootstrapping – especially in the beginning – is that it proves to you that you have a business model that works. Therefore, whenever you do receive some sort of infusion of capital you know what to do with it. My company is coming up to the point that we’re now looking for financial investors because it will help us scale and get to the next level. It just has to be the right investment. That’s important.
The Balancing Act: Motherhood + Relationships I don’t like to refer to it as a “balance.” I like to call it an organized juggle. I think that balance gives the idea that it’s going to be perfect and level all of the time. Not all areas of your life are going to be level at all times. I try to always focus on giving at least two things my undivided attention and I just keep rotating. You keep everything flowing and everything gets attention – just in rotation. As a woman entrepreneur, one of the biggest lessons I had to learn was making up time with my children after being away. Whether it was a big launch, an event or if I was working a lot of hours – I always make sure to make up the time with my family. Just like I make up missed time with my kids, I try to do the same thing with myself and my husband. You have to be intentional with date nights, with getting the kids in bed on time, with taking trips together. It’s important to note that while we’re growing successful brands and businesses, the love from another human being that loves you just for who you are is priceless.
Curating branded experiences: It’s really easy to curate a brand via social media. It’s a lot harder to curate an experience. I’m really good at curating experiences in real life. Whether your customers are coming in contact with your products in a store or at an event or trade show, you should always want their interactions with your brand to be memorable. I want my brand to have a positive impact on people. So, now the next time they encounter my brand they’ll remember that positive feeling. It takes thought, planning and strategy. I think that this is something that a lot of brands miss because they don’t think about their brand presence offline."

How Ground Beef Is The Suspected Cause Of The E. Coli Outbreak,www.forbes.com,Bruce Y. Lee,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/04/13/how-ground-beef-is-the-suspected-cause-of-the-e-coli-outbreak/?ss=healthcare,"If you like ground beef, you may have a beef with this announcement. Or maybe you don't want to have a beef, depending on what you prefer. On Friday, the Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC) announced that ground beef is now the suspected cause of the Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) O103 outbreak. This is the ongoing outbreak that I wrote about for Forbes last week . Since then, the number of reported cases has gone up to 109 (from 72). The number of states affected has increased from 5 to 6 with Indiana being added to the mix. And the number of hospitalizations has more than doubled from 8 to 17. Fortunately, no deaths have occurred to date.
The CDC didn't just hit the ground running with suspecting ground beef. Instead, investigators interviewed people who have gotten ill, asking them about what they had come into contact with and eaten the week before symptoms had begun. They then compared the answers with results from previous surveys of the general population, trying to determine what may have been different about the people who had gotten Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC ) O103 infections. One thing stood out: of the 75 interviewed, 63 (84%) had reported eating ground beef in the week prior. That's unusually high. Compare the 84% to the 39.8% of the population sample for the 2006-2007 FoodNet Population Survey who reported eating ground beef in the previous seven days .
Investigators are also conducting traceback investigations. This involves walking backwards to see where suspected food items may have come from to determine if there is a common source. Thus, the investigators are asking the people who got sick where they had eaten or purchased their ground beef. Then they are asking these restaurants and stores about who supplied their ground beef. And so forth. Basically, the investigators are traveling backwards through the supply chain that got the beef from the farms all the way to the plates of people, testing samples where relevant along the way. So far, these traceback investigations have not yielded a common source. But such investigations take time, especially when personnel and resources are limited.
So far, the CDC has not told anyone to completely avoid ground beef. For now, just be careful with ground beef, wherever you got it from, and use standard precautions. Wash thy hands thoroughly and frequently whenever you touch raw ground beef. The same applies to anything else that touches raw ground beef. If you don't normally do these things at all times, please do not throw any dinner parties ever.
Of course, this is not the time to try ground beef sushi or sashimi. Make sure that you thoroughly cook any ground beef before eating it, heating it to at least 160°F, the temperature needed to kill E. coli . Use a thermometer, because unless you are a thermometer, you can't tell whether the inside of the beef has reached that temperature. You've heard of the saying that you can't judge a book by its cover? Well, you can't really tell a beef temperature by its color. Beef turning brown alone does not mean that the temperature to kill E. coli has been achieved. Moreover, move the thermometer around while cooking, since all parts of the ground beef need to reach that temperature to ensure that no living STEC remains.

Getty Also, if you don't store raw beef properly, you will be in store for a lot more bacteria. When you buy raw ground beef, make sure that you refrigerate or freeze it within two hours. Don't go watch Captain Marvel in the movie theater first. If you aren't going to use the ground beef for a while, freeze it. Don't keep raw ground beef in the refrigerator for longer than 2 days. Until you are ready to cook the raw ground beef, keep it in either refrigerator or freezer at all times. There should be no reason to leave raw ground beef at room temperature for any length of time. If you need to thaw frozen raw ground beef, do it in the refrigerator.
When you eat at a restaurant, it is a little harder to stick your thermometer into the beef while it is cooking. The chef may tell you to go stick your thermometer somewhere else, and doing so may not be very pleasant. An alternative is to ask whomever is taking your order to confirm that all ground beef will be cooked to internal temperatures of at least 160°F. Don't be bashful about making such inquiries. Be suspicious of any food establishment that makes light of any food safety concerns. Run away from any place that pushes back on your request, otherwise you may get the runs or worse. (OK, maybe you should walk away rather than run away.)
The CDC and other public health officials remain on the ground, so to speak, to further investigate this outbreak. Beef on the lookout for any updates."
Why More Kids Are Going To The ER For Swallowing Objects,www.forbes.com,Bruce Y. Lee,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/04/12/why-more-kids-are-going-to-the-er-for-swallowing-objects/?ss=healthcare,"Gulp. A study published in Pediatrics showed that the rate of young kids going to emergency departments for swallowing non-food items more than doubled from 1995 to 2015. And most of these non-food items weren't good things to swallow, like pride. These findings came from an analysis performed by a research team from Nationwide Children's Hospital (Danielle Orsagh-Yentis, Rebecca J. McAdams, Kristin J. Roberts, and Lara B. McKenzie). It was a NEISS (pronounced ""nice"") study. NEISS stands for National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, a database that tracks people who suffer product- or activity-related injuries and then go to one of approximately 100 hospital emergency departments in U.S. For this study, the research team searched NEISS for kids less than six years of age who went to emergency departments for swallowing foreign bodies during the time period spanning from 1995 to 2015. This search found 759, 074 such cases during this time period. In 1995, there were 9.5 such visits per 10, 000 children. In 2015, this rate had jumped by 91.5% to 18 per 10,000 children.
Here were the most common objects swallowed:
Coins (61.7%) Toys (10.3%) Jewelry (7.0%) Batteries (6.8%)
The top-swallowed item adds new meaning to wanting your kids to change. Most ( 65.9%) of the ingested coins were pennies.
Over the two decades of the study period, there was an over 150-fold increase in the rate of batteries ingested. This was probably driven by the increasing use of button batteries, which are quite small and comprised 85.9% of the batteries swallowed. If the researchers had found an increase in the number of car batteries swallowed by kids then that would have had other implications.
If a swallowed object is something small enough, smooth, non-magnetic, and without harmful chemicals, it will probably eventually pass via poop. In a Lego swallowing study that I wrote about previously for Forbes , the FART ( Found and Retrieved Time) score for five Lego-swallowing adults volunteers ranged from a little over one day to about three days. Problems arise when the swallowed object is shaped in a way that may damage or get caught up in the kid's gastrointestinal tract or contain dangerous substances like batteries do.
This Children's Hospital of Philadelphia video shows additional dangers of button batteries including carrying an electrical charge:
If your kid swallows a button battery, call Poison Control and your doctor as soon as possible.
Then there are magnets, which can be an attractive situation. But not in a good way. If you swallow one magnet, the last thing you want to do is swallow another one. Because magnets are like Ted Mosby and Robin Schabowski from the television series How I Met Your Mother. They keep trying to get back together again, even if it means twisting, turning, and even tearing through your intestines. This can severely damage or block your intestines, which may be require emergency surgery.
This CNN segment shows a case of a kid swallowing 37 magnets:
Therefore, if your kid swallowed a magnet, call your doctor.
The study's numbers probably underestimate the rate of kids swallowing non-food items. Not all such ingestions may result in visits to emergency departments. A parent may just wait for the object to pass or take the kid to a clinic instead. In fact, the parent may not even realize that the kid has swallowed an item. Sometimes missing coins may go unmissed or at most result in ""Hmm, I thought I had a 77 cents in change but looks like I only have 20.""
What's been driving this increase in swallowed non-food items? Well, the increased availability of smaller and smaller household items such as button batteries may be factor. After all, many mobile devices that have smaller parts such as smartphones didn't really exist back in 1995. But that wouldn't explain the increase in coins swallowed. Coins have decreased in value but not in size. Are parents just leaving more stuff around their homes? Perhaps. Another question is whether parents are more distracted and paying less attention their kids, allowing their kids to roam around more unattended. After all, while you are busy arguing with others on Facebook, your toddler may vacuuming up coins like his Ponzi scheme has just been discovered.
Regardless of the reasons, it is important to remember that little kids put things in their mouths. That's how they figure things out and explore the world. Of course, eventually, most kids grow out of this habit, otherwise they'd be fired from their real estate and marketing jobs. At least, they should be. But as long as you have kids less than six years old roaming around in your home, make sure that you take proper precautions. Don't leave out in the open things that you wouldn't want swallowed. This includes items that may be removed from other objects, such as button batteries. Make sure that all swallow-able items are properly stored and secured. Beware of toys and household items that may be separable or detachable. Unless you are Magneto, keep your kids away from magnets. Avoid purchasing small items that you can't manage properly.
And, of course, pay attention to your kids and what they are doing. Time passes faster than you may anticipate and so might 57 cents in change."
Are Home Offices Fueling a Mental Health Crisis?,www.forbes.com,Laurel Farrer,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurelfarrer/2019/04/12/are-home-offices-fueling-a-mental-health-crisis/?ss=healthcare,"Since the inception of assembly lines, a single work model has not had as much impact on global socioeconomics as the rise of telecommuting. From workforce equality , to environmental sustainability , to economic development , remote work has unprecedented opportunities to solve global crises… but it is also fueling a new one.
Working from home puts professionals at higher risk for mental health concerns.
Getty In the 2019 State of Remote Work report produced by Buffer, the thousands of remote workers surveyed rave about the work-life balance, schedule flexibility, and work performance, that being able to work offsite lends in their lives. However, when asked about the downsides of location flexibility, 49% of remote workers note that their biggest struggle is wellness-related. More specifically, 22% can’t unplug after work, 19% feel lonely and 8% can’t stay motivated.
These statistics could have a number of subjective influencers, such as the management style of their boss, their local connection speed, their personality or even which organization tools are used. However, there is one dominant common thread that can’t be ignored: 84% of all remote workers are working from a home office.
The ability to work from anywhere has recently sparked the digital nomad movement in which professionals are able to travel the world, packing nothing but a laptop to keep them active in a part-time or full-time job. As glamorous as this might look on social media, the reality is that most remote workers are anxious to leave the time and distance of traveling during their commuting days, and instead just clock in from where they are already at.
Any remote worker will tell you that replacing suits with slippers is a liberating transition. However, it seems as though the confining corporate cubicles that we are so anxious to escape may actually be boosting our behavioral health. Dr. Amy Cirbus, PhD, LMHC, LPC, and Manager of Clinical Quality a t Talkspace , reports, “ Remote workers often experience symptoms of anxiety and depression at a higher rate than people commuting into traditional office spaces. Specifically, they report feelings of isolation and loneliness and high rates of worry about job performance and stability. Insomnia and sleep disturbance are common, along with increased fatigue, irritation, sadness and feelings of disconnection. Remote workers report a lack of concentration and focus that can compound and exacerbate these mental health challenges. It can lead to a loss of self-worth and a questioning of one’s abilities. Combined together, these symptoms can have a significant impact on job performance, job satisfaction and the efficiency of productive work.”
But why? If virtual professionals are claiming that work-life balance and lower stress convinced them to go remote, then where are these negative effects coming from? Hidden among the dream of flexibility and independence are these subtle dangers:
The freedom of higher autonomy also results in a heavier operational load of self-management responsibilities including IT troubleshooting, time management and task prioritization. A lack of environmental markers in career development (such as moving from a small cubicle into a large corner office) can prevent workers from recognizing progress and achievements. Over time, this can lead to concerns like career stagnancy or imposter syndrome. Freelancers (over 36% of the U.S. workforce) have the unique pressure of both finding work and producing it. This constant state of being in “the hustle” can contribute to sustained stress. Because the success of distributed teams is often measured by results, workers can be tempted (or pressured) to overwork to inflate their output. This can result in unpaid hours, lack of sleep, poor engagement in personal relationships or mental burnout. The idyllic serenity of an uninterrupted home office environment easily translates into deeply focused work sessions, which is great for productivity, but terrible for ergonomic health. The distractions of coworkers and bustling office activity subconsciously prompt us to take break from our sedentary work often enough to maintain visual, auditory, mental and chiropractic health. Speaking of chiropractic health, without significant intention and investment, most home offices are not equipped with ergonomic seating options. Over time, a worker’s chin, shoulders, and back being in a compromised position can contribute to feelings of stress and depression. When workers are geographically isolated, they can easily be informationally isolated as well, which prevents access to the resources they need to complete tasks. Compromised efficiency can cause increased worry about job performance, team trust, feelings of safety in job security and a lack of confidence. Poorly defined physical boundaries between a worker’s personal life and professional life (such as working from bed) can lead to poorly defined boundaries in time and mental thought processes, causing a difficulty in “unplugging.” Does this mean that the Remote Work Revolution is doomed to fail ? Should we all return to our offices for the sake of our mental wellness? Like the natural selection of all permanent species, the key to success isn’t to revert, it’s to adapt. Instead of racing back to headquarters to cure your office FOMO , try these strategies to keep your mind and emotions sharp:
1. Invest in a Home Office - If you are going to spend almost 24 hours a day in a single environment, it should certainly be a place that inspires and supports you. Mentally trigger schedule boundaries between your personal and professional time by defining a dedicated space to work. Then, deck it out with ergonomic features like supportive seating, lifted screens and over-ear headphones.
2. Diversify Interests - To strengthen confidence that isn’t defined by your work output, develop a sense of fulfillment outside of work. Stick to strict working hours, then contrast it with some exclusively personal and/or social time, such as participating in a group hobby, exploring local attractions as a family, or volunteering at a local organization.
3. Communicate Transparently - Anyone who maintains a long-distance relationship with a loved one can testify that a connection is only as strong as your communication. No matter how introverted you may or may not be, avoid feeling isolated by building a variety of channels of support to discuss your life (both personal and professional) with. Virtual coworker meetups , starting a video chat thread with a coworker, or chatting with a mental health professional for advice are great places to start.
4. Increase Movement - It’s dangerously easy to fall into a sedentary lifestyle when you live and work in the same few hundred square feet. To improve your mental, cardiovascular, visual and emotional health take breaks often during your work day, but not just a quick rabbit hole watching YouTube videos. For maximum benefit, step away from the screen and really get the blood moving with a short walk or workout.
5. Build a Support Network - Let’s face it, life isn’t always sunshine and rainbows, so design some umbrellas to use on the chance that a rain cloud shows up. Whether it be friends or fencing, figure out strategies that engage your soul and stimulate your brain, then integrate them into your life so they are easily accessible in times of need.
The short version is this: the government enforces thousands of occupational policies to keep you happy and healthy at work. When you create your own office, the importance of these regulations is not voided. But they are now your responsibility to design and enforce. Invest in your work by investing in your self-care, which can be as easy as plugging a few jumping jacks and personal phone calls into your daily routine. “ Research indicates that both exercise and connecting with others, even in short bursts, produces endorphins that boost mood, increase creativity and esteem, and decrease anxiety,” Dr. Cirbus encourages. “The key is the consistency. One afternoon walk or one lunch break with a colleague or friend won’t eliminate these mental health challenges. Making a daily commitment to healthy injections of well being on a regular basis is where the positive, lasting change occurs.”
Do you have strategies that strengthen your behavioral health while working remotely? Is there something in your office that keeps you feeling sharp and engaged? Share your tips with other virtual professionals around the world using the hashtag #happyhomeoffice, because apparently 49% of us need some advice."

ASSOCIATED PRESS This coming Monday, a highly anticipated trial between Qualcomm and Apple will start in San Diego. The legal showdown is the next, important chapter of a two-year conflict between the two technology powerhouses and now, in this trial, Apple’s contract manufacturers. You can get caught up to speed on the prior two years here .
Next week’s festivities are complex, as it is the amalgamation of four lawsuits brought together. Here is suing whom: Apple is suing Qualcomm for the alleged lack of payments for volume discounts as part of its BCPA (Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement), violating FRAND pricing for its wireless IP, and using its monopolistic position to charge too much for its IP. Apple’s contract manufacturers are suing Qualcomm similarly, for charging too much for its IP. Qualcomm is suing Apple’s contract manufacturers for withholding payments for the use of its IP Qualcomm is suing Apple for alleged tortious interference between Qualcomm and the contract manufacturers.
Fun, right? There has been and will continue to be much press about this conflict, but today I wanted to shed light on Apple’s relatively unknown contract manufacturers (CMs) or Original Device Manufacturers (ODMs) who are at the center of this conflict. ODMs, for the uninitiated, work on behalf of companies like Apple to manufacture their smartphones. Apple doesn’t manufacture its own devices and doesn’t actually have an IP agreement with Qualcomm; Qualcomm’s agreements are with the ODMs. I had a few decades of experience with ODMs when I was a hardware OEM and chip guy, and ODMs are an interesting bunch. Let’s take a closer look at who these ODMs are.
Foxconn, $152B revenue
Apple’s biggest ODM is Taiwan-based Foxconn (officially known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., LTD). Foxconn is the world’s biggest provider of electronics manufacturing, employing 250,000 worldwide (as of 2018), with manufacturing sites in Taipei, Suzhou, Mexico City, Madrid, Cleveland, and more. Most of its manufacturing is done in China.
Foxconn was founded by CEO Terry Gou back in 1974, with the stated goal of “providing low cost mechanical and electrical parts to drive down the overall cost of electronics worldwide.” I had met Terry Gou many times one on one when I worked in product management at Compaq Computer and did billions in business with him. Back then, Foxconn made cheap power supply PCBs (printed circuit boards) and connectors. Foxconn Technology Group Chairman Terry Gou speaks during the groundbreaking ceremony for the company’s headquarters in Shanghai, China, Thursday, May 10, 2012. Foxconn Technology Group, the world’s biggest assembler of consumer electronics, began work Thursday on the headquarters that it says will help spearhead its efforts to sell more in the China market.

ASSOCIATED PRESS
Today it’s a powerhouse, a public company with revenue of over $152B in 2018. Foxconn specializes in the manufacturing of smartphones, PCs, servers, power supplies, and connectors. In addition to Apple, its top 5 customers include Dell, HP Inc., Samsung, and LG. You’ve likely used a Foxconn-manufactured product—its repertoire includes iPhones, iPods, iPads, and the Apple Watch.
The company has to be applauded for providing so much economic opportunity for 250,000 of its workers, but it’s not without controversy. It has suffered from allegations of poor working conditions, with long working hours. In 2010, 14 Foxconn employees committed suicide, a spate that was attributed to at the company’s high-pressure, exploitative work environment (read an excerpt from Brian Merchant’s The One Device: The Secret History of the iPhone , published by The Guardian here ). Apple vowed to investigate the manufacturer, with Tim Cook reportedly meeting with suicide-prevention experts and top Foxconn management in 2011. Ultimately Apple decided to maintain the working relationship.
The company also recently drew headlines (many negative) over its plans to build a manufacturing hub in Wisconsin, incentivized by the largest public subsidy package ever granted to a foreign company by the U.S—approximately $4.5B worth of incentives. Foxconn initially promised to provide as many as 13,000 well-paid jobs by 2022, an economic impact that was thrown into doubt by reports that Foxconn was considering cutting manufacturing and utilizing the Wisconsin facility solely for R&D (Bloomberg recently published a scathing report on the deal here , if interested in reading more). Recently, according to CNN , Foxconn walked back earlier reports and said that it would, in fact, utilize the Wisconsin facility for manufacturing, though it remains unclear how many jobs would fit under that umbrella versus R&D and knowledge worker roles.
Foxconn is the giant in the industry, and I feel it’s safe to say was built, in part, by Apple. I worked at Compaq with Dan Riccio, a Compaq mechanical engineer at the time, now Apple’s head of Hardware, who I know knew Gou and worked with Foxconn.
Wistron, $29B revenue
Next is Wistron, another Taiwan-based manufacturer of computer and consumer electronics products. Wistron got its start as the manufacturing branch of Acer, spinning off of the PC maker back in 2000. Its lines of business include notebook and desktop PCs, server and storage systems, handheld devices, and various networking and communication products, but it’s best known as one of the world’s largest manufacturer of notebook computers. Its big-name partnerships include Apple, Microsoft, Dell, Hewlett Packard, and, of course, Acer. Simon Lin, chairman and chief executive officer of Wistron Corp., arrives at an Intel Corp. news conference in Taipei, Taiwan, on Thursday, Oct. 28, 2010.

Wistron is a publicly traded company that, as of 2018, employs 83,000 people worldwide, in manufacturing and support centers across China, Malaysia, Mexico, the Czech Republic, and the United States. In 2018, Wistron raked in revenue of $28.9B with gross profits near $1.21B.
Wistron was in the news Friday in Patently Apple regarding the Indian government suspending Apple’s import permit asking the question, “Did Wistron or another Apple supplier try to hide their non-compliance with e-waste rules?” Being a global smartphone/PC ODM is tough.
Pegatron, $44B
This brings us to Pegatron, also headquartered in Taiwan. Pegatron began its journey as the production arm of ASUSTek Computer (also known as ASUS), spinning off in 2008. ASUS, for that matter, still holds roughly 17% of the company’s shares. Pegatron specializes in the manufacturing of desktop and notebook PCs, wireless systems, motherboards, game consoles, smartphones, and TVs, and boasts both Apple and HP as its biggest customers. The iPhone 4 and iPhone 5c were both manufactured by Pegatron. Employees line up for roll call at a Pegatron Corp. factory in Shanghai, China, on Friday, April 15, 2016.

As of 2018, Pegatron employs roughly 90,000 people worldwide, in Taiwan, the Czech Republic, China, Mexico, Japan, and the United States. In 2018, it pulled in a revenue of $44.43B with profits of $1.29B. Like Foxconn, Pegatron has also come under scrutiny in the past for worker conditions at its factories near Shanghai, which manufacture Apple products (see the BBC’s undercover report here ). In 2016, Bloomberg got a tour of the factory and reported that “Pegatron and Apple adopted new procedures to keep iPhone assemblers from amassing excessive overtime.”
Pegatron recently signed onto Apple’s “commitment to run their Apple production on 100 percent clean energy.”
Compal, $32B revenue
Lastly, let’s talk about Compal. The smallest of these 4 ODMs, Compal is also located in Taiwan and employs roughly 64,000 people. It was founded in 1984 and is known primarily for manufacturing notebooks, mobile devices, connected devices, liquid crystal displays, and health care products. Compal is purportedly in the midst of trying to expand beyond its primary PC business, dipping its toes into the mobile device and industrial computer sectors, according to Nikkei Asian Review. The exterior of the Compal electronics, Inc.â€™s headquarters is seen in Taipei, Taiwan on Monday, October 23, 2006. Compal Electronics Inc., the world’s second-largest maker of notebook computers, reported a 2 percent drop in third-quarter profit on price declines and losses at its flat-screen and telecommunications investments.

Compal is responsible for the manufacturing of many products you may have used at some point—Amazon Alexa, Dell and Lenovo PCs, Apple iPads, HTC, and Sony smartphones. Compal brought in $32.09B in revenue in 2018, with profits of $987.67M. The company’s main manufacturing plant is in China, and, in addition to its headquarters in Taipei, it has offices across South Korea, the UK, the United States, and China.
Wrapping up
Hopefully, these Apple iPhone ODM profiles will serve as useful background information on some of the lesser-known players in the larger Apple-Qualcomm feud, which is set to reach a crescendo in the coming weeks. The net-net, Apple’s top 4 iPhone smartphone ODMs are very large and sophisticated companies, driving $260B in revenue, are based in Taiwan, do most of their manufacturing in China, employing half a million people. Keep that in mind as you follow along with the trial the next six weeks. I will be following the trial with interest—stay tuned for further coverage.

Healthcare In The Age Of Personalization Part 6: People Experts - We Need You,www.forbes.com,Glenn Llopis,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/glennllopis/2019/04/14/healthcare-in-the-age-of-personalization-part-6-people-experts-we-need-you/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin This is Part 6, the final part of this series on Healthcare in the Age of Personalization. Part 5 is here . Healthcare in the Age of Personalization Glenn Llopis Group, LLC
This entire series has been about this new age of personalization – the need for organizations to elevate and activate individuals. And who in an organization is responsible for the people of the organization? Human Resources.
But most HR leaders have been trained in standardization. They report to CEOs and boards steeped in standardization. They manage clinical and non-clinical leaders who are used to standardization.
Even when HR leaders agree 100% with the need for inclusion that honors this age of personalization, and even when the people they lead and report to agree as well – we are all up against massive systems designed for the opposite.
In the opening article of this series, I introduced the age of personalization , how it’s connected to inclusion, why it is significant for healthcare, and why healthcare in particular can help point the way for all industries to lead in the age of personalization. In the articles that followed, I discussed the real metrics of inclusion , how business models must evolve , how personalization intersects with population health and the clinical implications .
This time I’ll explore the role and opportunity for HR to move this transformation forward.
As I’ve said before – the way an organization functions, and the way its leaders function, depends on the systems and methods and processes that are in place. We can have all the high-minded goals we want, but we will not reach them if the system is designed for something else.
We have to change the system. HR can either be the biggest advocate for creating a system designed for personalization, or its biggest hurdle.
Individuals are in control now – of your workplace, of your brand, of how they want to experience your services and care.
HR needs to play a much greater role in influencing the decisions that are made not only among patients, but also among employees and the role that the entire enterprise plays in shifting the mindset of the healthcare industry from services to individuals.
The way we work is changing.
One of the reasons this is so urgent is the world of work itself is changing drastically. I spoke with Anton Andrews, director of Office Envisioning at Microsoft .
Andrews described the emergence of what he called the “discoverer’s mindset” within an organization: “In an age of uncertainty, in order to stay relevant, people are having to constantly redefine themselves. Whether it's a government, whether it's a large company, whether it's a hospital. So the ability for people to learn and grow is becoming increasingly critical. And that doesn't happen if you have a static job description and a static job function.”
No matter our place in the organization, we have to adopt this mindset of being entrepreneurial with our own careers. And HR needs to build the system that enables people to do that. As you’ll see throughout this article, healthcare needs to boost its ability to attract top talent and keep people included and engaged in meaningful work.
As Andrews put it: “The idea of fluidizing internally is not a fancy idea. It's an idea that really accelerates learning and growth of individuals, and by doing that accelerates the ability of the organization to fully tap in to the power and the energy of the people in it.”
There is so much overlapping change happening in healthcare (for all the reasons I’ve addressed throughout this series). It’s critical that HR use its influence to tap into the power and energy of people.
This brings everything together – this age of personalization, the corresponding need for inclusion, and the strategic role that HR can and should be playing to help organizations make these transitions.
Uprooting ourselves from standardization.
I spoke about this topic with CEOs and chief HR officers for major U.S. healthcare organizations. They share my emphasis on inclusion and were open about the challenges of evolving an organization and an industry.
Teri Fontenot is CEO Emeritus of Woman’s Hospital in Baton Rouge, Louisiana – the only independent, nonprofit women’s hospital in the country. In February 2019 Fontenot announced her plans to retire.
She offered some insight into why evolving out of standardization can be so difficult within healthcare in particular.
In this industry, “people are used to working under policies, procedures and protocols, and are accustomed to and comfortable with working in routines that are known and proven to them,” she said. “Because we are talking about healthcare, and so there's not a lot of experimenting that ought to go on in healthcare, except in the most controlled circumstances. Patients want what they want, but they don't always know what is going to be safest or best for them. On the other hand, providers cannot act like they know what's best for a patient either.”
But adherence to standards is a practice that has been instilled and reinforced throughout entire careers, from early training through to leadership positions.
“Physicians who entered practice 30 years ago were taught: ‘you are the captain of the ship, you are completely responsible for this patient,’ – that's why they call it ‘writing orders,’” said Fontenot.
But she said that’s changing.
“I think it's really moving more into a team and multidisciplinary approach,” she said. “I'm really pleased and proud of our business sector. The healthcare field has worked very, very hard. The medical schools are training physicians differently. The disruptors are the clients, the customers, the patients. We think a lot in healthcare about disruption coming from other competitors doing things that are progressive or innovative. But it's really the patients as consumers who see new ways of accessing services that better meet their needs than the traditional way.”
She also mentioned the challenge of trying to change an industry when the regulations hold you back.
“Another reason why there's been a drag on transformation is all the governmental regulations just don't keep up with what we're trying to do,” said Fontenot. “So it's also having to navigate around those other kinds of limitations.”
She sets a great example of leadership based on the future.
“My job is to aspire and inspire,” she said. “My job is to be thinking about where we're trying to be five or 10 years from now, not what we're doing today, and try to think strategically about how we're going to get there.”
HR needs to be part of corporate strategy.
Margie Vargas is senior vice president and chief human resources officer for Memorial Healthcare System in South Florida.
She agrees that the role of HR needs to evolve to be consultative.
“We have to evolve the practice of human resources to truly be consultative,” she said. “I think HR professionals have developed that skill over time – to be a consultant that impacts all areas of the industry, not just human resources.”
But she also sees the challenges embedded within a function that has been born and bred to be compliance-driven.
“Back in the day, when you became an HR professional you really honed your skills on the HR-specific competencies that were necessary to be compliant,” she explained. “Just be compliant, that was all that was needed, right? Tell the organization what it needs to do to be compliant.”
She said that’s changing.
“I had a conversation with a group of HR business partners that we're mentoring right now, where none of their mentoring learning objectives have anything to do with HR,” she said. “[The objectives now] have to do with how involved are you in understanding what drives your business? What is your business acumen? Where is your contribution to the critical evaluation of program development? What drives the organization, and how are you connected to the mission?”
She gave an example of one way HR is contributing to the larger business goals. She said they’re looking to see if there’s a correlation with employee turnover and patient satisfaction.
“We correlated the turnover to the employee engagement survey to the patient satisfaction scores over the last 12 months and to leadership performance,” she said. “That's the type of people analytics that tells a story, so we can then create strategies on how to improve the patient experience, elevate caregiver contribution, and also identify gaps in leadership and create strategies to mitigate some of those gaps.”
The usual starting point – unconscious bias training.
Whenever the subject is inclusion, especially related to HR and compliance, the common starting point is unconscious bias training. I usually view that as a PR-motivated move as a way for a company to manage its reputation, often after a race-related scandal.
I always have a similar thought: I don’t want to hear about your unconscious bias training – I want to hear about what comes AFTER your unconscious bias training. How are you using that as a starting point? How are you pivoting from that training to then start to create the structure that will embed awareness about our individuality into every project, every team, every department, every interaction with peers and patients?
Pamela Abner is doing just that. She is vice president and chief administrative officer of diversity and inclusion for Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. She’s laying a foundation for inclusion by developing education and training, by creating best practices for things like how they collect patient information, and she and some people on her team are even getting certified as patient experience professionals. All so they help embed inclusive thinking throughout the organization.
She uses unconscious bias training as a starting point. But that’s just the beginning.
“We want to embrace or recognize that we have varying backgrounds,” she said. “I want us not talking about one particular thing – whether it’s race, sexual identity, sexual orientation, gender identity, state of ability, disability or religion. Those are all things that fall into that bucket. All that means is that we're thinking about everyone. Then, what do we do when we're aware and we're thinking about everyone? If we can even assume that everybody is aware that people are different, it's how do we then provide the appropriate care and bring people what they need that's right for them. That's the hardest part, for sure.”
The training can be valuable and can have a direct impact on patient care. Because bias is not just about stereotypes – it’s about how our brains use shortcuts to help us understand the vast array of stimuli the brain processes every minute. Those shortcuts can be helpful, but they can also limit our ability to understand each other. Abner shared an example with me.
She said the head of their trauma unit was doing rounds. Before he walked into a room, someone gave him the summary of the patient. He was told the patient was an elderly white woman who they said had dementia.
Abner said this doctor happens to be black and Jamaican. He went into the room and started asking the screening questions you ask when you hear someone has dementia.
“The person seemed to respond fine,” said Abner. “She did not seem to present at all as someone with dementia. However, she had an incredibly thick and authentic Jamaican accent. The doctor turned to his team and he said, ‘this patient doesn't have dementia. She's Jamaican.’”
This is where the shortcuts our brains take can actually slow us down.
According to Abner: “This is a bias thing, because they see the woman as being white, and people sometimes don't realize that in the Caribbean you have island people who are white, or otherwise Caucasian-looking, but they speak just like the island folks. When we teach about unconscious bias we say ‘hear with your eyes.’ They saw something their brains could not connect as a Jamaican accent. They just thought: there's something wrong with this woman. She must not have all her faculties. Now, if that attending physician had not been a person from a background different from the rest of the team, that woman would have been treated and handled as though she had dementia when she did not.”
That’s such an important lesson about bias – it goes well beyond the stereotyping we usually associate with it, to include general misunderstandings among people. In healthcare, misunderstandings can lead to the wrong kind of treatment. Worst case, it can be a matter of life and death.
“When we teach we say don't be fooled by what you hear and what you see because your mind plays tricks on you,” said Abner.
Her approach beyond the unconscious bias training is intentional and specific.
“Those are my two favorite words, by the way – intention and specific – because you don't get anywhere without some intention and being specific,” she said. “Once we identify what [inclusion] problem we’re trying to solve, and what have we identified as our key issues, then let's start to measure something. We have to come out of this endeavor with a measurement.”
If people are so mission-driven these days, why does healthcare have a talent shortage?
In a survey of healthcare leaders released in January 2019, J.P. Morgan found that the talent shortage is top of mind, with 92 percent of respondents saying they were at least somewhat concerned with finding candidates with the right skill set. For 35 percent of respondents, the talent shortage is one of their top three challenges. While the physicians and nurses topped the list of most challenging positions to fill, nearly a third (29%) of respondents said it’s hard to fill mid-level management, 21% have trouble filling administrative positions, and 18% said senior management positions are most challenging to fill.
In an age when more and more people say they want their careers to be meaningful, they want to do something with purpose – why isn’t healthcare able to overcome its talent shortage? Of all possible career fields, if your goal is to make a difference in the world, healthcare should be at the top of your mind as a place to anchor your career, whether you’re a caregiver or an accountant.
But it’s not. Why? At least partly, it’s because healthcare struggles with this transition to personalization.
I talked with Joe Moscola, senior vice president and chief people officer for Northwell Health in New York, about how to prepare for the age of personalization. He agreed that there is a lot of innovation needed in healthcare today.
“The consumer is looking for [individuality], because it exists in the rest of our lives – that ability to have that individual approach that is unique to them, their own thumbprint,” said Moscola. “To be able to get my own medical records in a way that is useful for me, that I can understand, in the language that I speak, and the ability to communicate with someone who communicates the way I need to communicate.”
Those are big challenges that require many different types of expertise to meet those challenges. Now if we can just help people see the opportunity to make their own impact.
Moscola talked about the role of HR in the context of all that: “How are we able to build a pipeline, build enthusiasm around the work that we're doing, grow diverse skill sets, with people who understand all those complexities and those challenges that exist in each individual community, each individual culture and gender? And how do we begin to really advance that strategy through the talent that we bring in? That's a big part of how we're beginning to look at it.”
As it so often does in this age of personalization, it comes down to the experience that each individual feels like he or she can get as an employee. He said when people leave an organization, it’s often because they don’t feel like they can follow their mission there.
He described it like this: “To dig down a little bit deeper, [people are asking themselves] ‘am I able to go after my career mission? That passion I have to help people or to cure people – can I follow that mission here?’ And I think the way we begin to have really changed leadership, and how they think on it. This is just one person's opinion, but do I think it goes back to some basics about how to unlock someone's total, maximum potential through the mentorship, the coaching, and then sponsorship of that individual. And then, how many people can you realistically do that for? And what tools do you need to do that?”
Challenge of talent pool – people don’t think of healthcare careers beyond doctors and nurses.
The industry needs to be better at selling itself beyond the obvious medical careers.
Cathy Fraser is chief human resources officer of Mayo Clinic , and she shared some of those challenges with the talent shortages. She said she visits middle schools and high schools and asks the students why they’re interested in healthcare. They all say they want to be doctors and nurses. But there are so many other ways to help people live healthy lives.
“One of the best things we also can do is treat healthcare as a vertical, as an industry, it is not a function,” said Fraser. “Kids are taught early that you see yourself as a caregiver in some form because you helped your teddy bear when it got ripped, and you took it to your mommy to give it a band-aid. That’s caregiving. But there’s also the ability to be successful in healthcare as a finance person, as an IT person, as a mechanic, as a glassblower – you can do it because the vertical has every job in it. We have not done a good job as an industry to promote the concept that healthcare is all professions, not just clinical.”
Her own career path includes multiple industries before moving into healthcare. She values a diversity of experience, and has created a structure within the organization for people to move around and experiment with their careers.
“We hire good people and we give them the freedom to do a lot of different things in the organization,” said Fraser. “The guy who was my second person, my next level in HR, just took a job working as the vice chair of administration of research for Mayo Clinic's research organization. You don't typically get someone who's a high-level HR executive going over to run an administration job in research. But we see more and more of that here because we are looking at talented people, and we're rotating them through different roles, sometimes full-time, but sometimes they're only part-time.”
She said people can take a six-month agile staffing opportunity, experience something new, and then come back.
“This allows people to navigate their own careers, and with actually pretty robust programs for tuition reimbursement as well,” she said. “Humans want to learn, they want to expand, they want to grow, but most organizations make it really, really difficult to do something new.”
She said it’s difficult to be a successful CHRO if you've only come up through the HR discipline.
“People meet me, and they'll think, ‘you're in HR, that's odd,’ – I get that a lot,” she said. “It has to do with the fact that when I came out of grad school I was a finance person working for an airline. Then I actually worked at McKinsey & Company and worked on retail and consumer goods. It's that variety of experience that makes it easy for me to see things clearly that are not traditional HR. So the best thing I would ever advise someone who's coming up through HR is to get out of HR, go spend some time somewhere else, enhance your ability to see things from a different view.”
A systematic approach to inclusion.
In the last article I mentioned my conversation with two leaders from the University of Pennsylvania: Jaya Aysola, MD, MPH, assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine and executive director for Penn Medicine Health Equity Initiative; and Eve Higginbotham, SM, MD, is a professor of ophthalmology and vice dean for inclusion and diversity of the Perelman School of Medicine.
They work together to take the concepts of inclusion and equity and translate them into action items that can be operationalized within the health system – focusing on culture to enhance patient care delivery, scientific innovation and retention efforts.
They conducted a qualitative narrative analysis to better understand what can be done to improve inclusion within healthcare organizations.
They said something I agree with wholeheartedly: Some of the first ways in which to operationalize inclusion is to measure it. They looked into identifying the key factors that organizations can look at when they're thinking about inclusion.
Through their study, they found six factors were consistent regardless of subgroup. The study (see link above) offers the details, but I’ll rely on how Dr. Aysola described the results to me.
Overwhelmingly, minorities and women said they feel like there isn’t a level playing field, that standards in general within an organization aren’t applied equally. Many reported micro-affirmations and nepotism at play in favor of white males.
There was also a significant narrative around the silent bystander: “Often, discriminatory remarks or bigoted remarks happen in an environment with many witnesses, who remain silent,” said Dr. Aysola.
She believes empowering those silent witnesses is a key first step in changing an organization’s culture: “It can be as simple as when, in a committee meeting, a female might raise a really wonderful point, then that point is repeated directly by someone else and presented as their own point. That’s an opportunity for the chair to say, ‘Oh, that's really great, Dan, that you highlighted Mary's point.’”
That’s such a concrete way that leaders can operationalize inclusion in the moment and begin to move the culture toward personalization one interaction at a time.
Build trust by building relationships.
How do you take people who are not engaged and are unwilling to show their true individuality if they don't trust leaders? How do you tackle that?
Nikki Sumpter is senior vice president and chief HR officer for Atlantic Health System in New Jersey. I asked her about building trust and her first response was to say: “This is my favorite part of what I do.”
From previous jobs, she shared examples of taking care of employees, addressing issues of living wage, increasing the training that’s available for development. When she joined Atlantic Health she saw that the organization already had a strong foundation of trust. That came in handy as she helped navigate what she described as a tremendous amount of transformation: a new CEO, other new executives, the rollout of a new Electronic Health Record (EHR) system.
“We have to listen,” said Sumpter. “I can focus HR and get a whole bunch of stuff done, but it may not be what the organization needs today. If we can't be inclusive in our thoughts, if we can't get any of that right, you will have silos. How do you break through those barriers? By meeting people where they are, literally. Literally. It's taking things in one bite at a time in building trust. Culture doesn't happen overnight.”
She brought it back to relationships and to making sure HR plays a role in organizational strategy.
“I think relationships are important,” she said. “Start with everyone on the executive team and find out what the priorities are. But it's not enough to just know what their goals are. What role does HR play in every one of the goals? Because all of the work occurs through people. I mean there's nothing that is happening that a person isn't touching. How is HR supporting everyone's goal? If you could figure that out, that's the start.”
To be ready for personalization, you need your people.
It all comes back to people. To individuals.
To return to Anton Andrews from Microsoft: “New challenges are going to be arising constantly in real time. Is your organization making use of the people in it? Is your network making use of the people in it and allowing them to actually cluster around those challenges as they arise, and bring their expertise to those challenges?”
This is the role HR must play in the age of personalization.
At a time when we are personalizing healthcare, HR should be one of the most sophisticated departments in the organization. You’re the ones who can see what needs to be solved at every level throughout the organization, help individuals know what they are uniquely suited to solve for, then connect people so they can cluster around those challenges and work together to overcome them.
You’re the ones who connect all the dots (take this assessment to measure your effectiveness).
In this age of personalization, the role of chief people officer is the most important role in any organization. It’s PEOPLE who will deliver the innovation needed to take advantage of opportunities for growth. It’s PEOPLE who will revolutionize the way you serve patients, employees and your community. It’s PEOPLE who will transform healthcare for this age of personalization.

As I’ve said before – the way an organization functions, and the way its leaders function, depends on the systems and methods and processes that are in place. We can have all the high-minded goals we want, but we will not reach them if the system is designed for something else.
We have to change the system. HR can either be the biggest advocate for creating a system designed for personalization, or its biggest hurdle.
Individuals are in control now – of your workplace, of your brand, of how they want to experience your services and care.
HR needs to play a much greater role in influencing the decisions that are made not only among patients, but also among employees and the role that the entire enterprise plays in shifting the mindset of the healthcare industry from services to individuals.
The way we work is changing.
One of the reasons this is so urgent is the world of work itself is changing drastically. I spoke with Anton Andrews, director of Office Envisioning at Microsoft .
Andrews described the emergence of what he called the “discoverer’s mindset” within an organization: “In an age of uncertainty, in order to stay relevant, people are having to constantly redefine themselves. Whether it's a government, whether it's a large company, whether it's a hospital. So the ability for people to learn and grow is becoming increasingly critical. And that doesn't happen if you have a static job description and a static job function.”
No matter our place in the organization, we have to adopt this mindset of being entrepreneurial with our own careers. And HR needs to build the system that enables people to do that. As you’ll see throughout this article, healthcare needs to boost its ability to attract top talent and keep people included and engaged in meaningful work.
As Andrews put it: “The idea of fluidizing internally is not a fancy idea. It's an idea that really accelerates learning and growth of individuals, and by doing that accelerates the ability of the organization to fully tap in to the power and the energy of the people in it.”
There is so much overlapping change happening in healthcare (for all the reasons I’ve addressed throughout this series). It’s critical that HR use its influence to tap into the power and energy of people.
This brings everything together – this age of personalization, the corresponding need for inclusion, and the strategic role that HR can and should be playing to help organizations make these transitions.
Uprooting ourselves from standardization.
I spoke about this topic with CEOs and chief HR officers for major U.S. healthcare organizations. They share my emphasis on inclusion and were open about the challenges of evolving an organization and an industry.
Teri Fontenot is CEO Emeritus of Woman’s Hospital in Baton Rouge, Louisiana – the only independent, nonprofit women’s hospital in the country. In February 2019 Fontenot announced her plans to retire.
She offered some insight into why evolving out of standardization can be so difficult within healthcare in particular.
In this industry, “people are used to working under policies, procedures and protocols, and are accustomed to and comfortable with working in routines that are known and proven to them,” she said. “Because we are talking about healthcare, and so there's not a lot of experimenting that ought to go on in healthcare, except in the most controlled circumstances. Patients want what they want, but they don't always know what is going to be safest or best for them. On the other hand, providers cannot act like they know what's best for a patient either.”
But adherence to standards is a practice that has been instilled and reinforced throughout entire careers, from early training through to leadership positions.
“Physicians who entered practice 30 years ago were taught: ‘you are the captain of the ship, you are completely responsible for this patient,’ – that's why they call it ‘writing orders,’” said Fontenot.
But she said that’s changing.
“I think it's really moving more into a team and multidisciplinary approach,” she said. “I'm really pleased and proud of our business sector. The healthcare field has worked very, very hard. The medical schools are training physicians differently. The disruptors are the clients, the customers, the patients. We think a lot in healthcare about disruption coming from other competitors doing things that are progressive or innovative. But it's really the patients as consumers who see new ways of accessing services that better meet their needs than the traditional way.”
She also mentioned the challenge of trying to change an industry when the regulations hold you back.
“Another reason why there's been a drag on transformation is all the governmental regulations just don't keep up with what we're trying to do,” said Fontenot. “So it's also having to navigate around those other kinds of limitations.”
She sets a great example of leadership based on the future.
“My job is to aspire and inspire,” she said. “My job is to be thinking about where we're trying to be five or 10 years from now, not what we're doing today, and try to think strategically about how we're going to get there.”
HR needs to be part of corporate strategy.
Margie Vargas is senior vice president and chief human resources officer for Memorial Healthcare System in South Florida.
She agrees that the role of HR needs to evolve to be consultative.
“We have to evolve the practice of human resources to truly be consultative,” she said. “I think HR professionals have developed that skill over time – to be a consultant that impacts all areas of the industry, not just human resources.”
But she also sees the challenges embedded within a function that has been born and bred to be compliance-driven.
“Back in the day, when you became an HR professional you really honed your skills on the HR-specific competencies that were necessary to be compliant,” she explained. “Just be compliant, that was all that was needed, right? Tell the organization what it needs to do to be compliant.”
She said that’s changing.
“I had a conversation with a group of HR business partners that we're mentoring right now, where none of their mentoring learning objectives have anything to do with HR,” she said. “[The objectives now] have to do with how involved are you in understanding what drives your business? What is your business acumen? Where is your contribution to the critical evaluation of program development? What drives the organization, and how are you connected to the mission?”
She gave an example of one way HR is contributing to the larger business goals. She said they’re looking to see if there’s a correlation with employee turnover and patient satisfaction.
“We correlated the turnover to the employee engagement survey to the patient satisfaction scores over the last 12 months and to leadership performance,” she said. “That's the type of people analytics that tells a story, so we can then create strategies on how to improve the patient experience, elevate caregiver contribution, and also identify gaps in leadership and create strategies to mitigate some of those gaps.”
The usual starting point – unconscious bias training.
Whenever the subject is inclusion, especially related to HR and compliance, the common starting point is unconscious bias training. I usually view that as a PR-motivated move as a way for a company to manage its reputation, often after a race-related scandal.
I always have a similar thought: I don’t want to hear about your unconscious bias training – I want to hear about what comes AFTER your unconscious bias training. How are you using that as a starting point? How are you pivoting from that training to then start to create the structure that will embed awareness about our individuality into every project, every team, every department, every interaction with peers and patients?
Pamela Abner is doing just that. She is vice president and chief administrative officer of diversity and inclusion for Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. She’s laying a foundation for inclusion by developing education and training, by creating best practices for things like how they collect patient information, and she and some people on her team are even getting certified as patient experience professionals. All so they help embed inclusive thinking throughout the organization.
She uses unconscious bias training as a starting point. But that’s just the beginning.
“We want to embrace or recognize that we have varying backgrounds,” she said. “I want us not talking about one particular thing – whether it’s race, sexual identity, sexual orientation, gender identity, state of ability, disability or religion. Those are all things that fall into that bucket. All that means is that we're thinking about everyone. Then, what do we do when we're aware and we're thinking about everyone? If we can even assume that everybody is aware that people are different, it's how do we then provide the appropriate care and bring people what they need that's right for them. That's the hardest part, for sure.”
The training can be valuable and can have a direct impact on patient care. Because bias is not just about stereotypes – it’s about how our brains use shortcuts to help us understand the vast array of stimuli the brain processes every minute. Those shortcuts can be helpful, but they can also limit our ability to understand each other. Abner shared an example with me.
She said the head of their trauma unit was doing rounds. Before he walked into a room, someone gave him the summary of the patient. He was told the patient was an elderly white woman who they said had dementia.
Abner said this doctor happens to be black and Jamaican. He went into the room and started asking the screening questions you ask when you hear someone has dementia.
“The person seemed to respond fine,” said Abner. “She did not seem to present at all as someone with dementia. However, she had an incredibly thick and authentic Jamaican accent. The doctor turned to his team and he said, ‘this patient doesn't have dementia. She's Jamaican.’”
This is where the shortcuts our brains take can actually slow us down.
According to Abner: “This is a bias thing, because they see the woman as being white, and people sometimes don't realize that in the Caribbean you have island people who are white, or otherwise Caucasian-looking, but they speak just like the island folks. When we teach about unconscious bias we say ‘hear with your eyes.’ They saw something their brains could not connect as a Jamaican accent. They just thought: there's something wrong with this woman. She must not have all her faculties. Now, if that attending physician had not been a person from a background different from the rest of the team, that woman would have been treated and handled as though she had dementia when she did not.”
That’s such an important lesson about bias – it goes well beyond the stereotyping we usually associate with it, to include general misunderstandings among people. In healthcare, misunderstandings can lead to the wrong kind of treatment. Worst case, it can be a matter of life and death.
“When we teach we say don't be fooled by what you hear and what you see because your mind plays tricks on you,” said Abner.
Her approach beyond the unconscious bias training is intentional and specific.
“Those are my two favorite words, by the way – intention and specific – because you don't get anywhere without some intention and being specific,” she said. “Once we identify what [inclusion] problem we’re trying to solve, and what have we identified as our key issues, then let's start to measure something. We have to come out of this endeavor with a measurement.”
If people are so mission-driven these days, why does healthcare have a talent shortage?
In a survey of healthcare leaders released in January 2019, J.P. Morgan found that the talent shortage is top of mind, with 92 percent of respondents saying they were at least somewhat concerned with finding candidates with the right skill set. For 35 percent of respondents, the talent shortage is one of their top three challenges. While the physicians and nurses topped the list of most challenging positions to fill, nearly a third (29%) of respondents said it’s hard to fill mid-level management, 21% have trouble filling administrative positions, and 18% said senior management positions are most challenging to fill.
In an age when more and more people say they want their careers to be meaningful, they want to do something with purpose – why isn’t healthcare able to overcome its talent shortage? Of all possible career fields, if your goal is to make a difference in the world, healthcare should be at the top of your mind as a place to anchor your career, whether you’re a caregiver or an accountant.
But it’s not. Why? At least partly, it’s because healthcare struggles with this transition to personalization.
I talked with Joe Moscola, senior vice president and chief people officer for Northwell Health in New York, about how to prepare for the age of personalization. He agreed that there is a lot of innovation needed in healthcare today.
“The consumer is looking for [individuality], because it exists in the rest of our lives – that ability to have that individual approach that is unique to them, their own thumbprint,” said Moscola. “To be able to get my own medical records in a way that is useful for me, that I can understand, in the language that I speak, and the ability to communicate with someone who communicates the way I need to communicate.”
Those are big challenges that require many different types of expertise to meet those challenges. Now if we can just help people see the opportunity to make their own impact.
Moscola talked about the role of HR in the context of all that: “How are we able to build a pipeline, build enthusiasm around the work that we're doing, grow diverse skill sets, with people who understand all those complexities and those challenges that exist in each individual community, each individual culture and gender? And how do we begin to really advance that strategy through the talent that we bring in? That's a big part of how we're beginning to look at it.”
As it so often does in this age of personalization, it comes down to the experience that each individual feels like he or she can get as an employee. He said when people leave an organization, it’s often because they don’t feel like they can follow their mission there.
He described it like this: “To dig down a little bit deeper, [people are asking themselves] ‘am I able to go after my career mission? That passion I have to help people or to cure people – can I follow that mission here?’ And I think the way we begin to have really changed leadership, and how they think on it. This is just one person's opinion, but do I think it goes back to some basics about how to unlock someone's total, maximum potential through the mentorship, the coaching, and then sponsorship of that individual. And then, how many people can you realistically do that for? And what tools do you need to do that?”
Challenge of talent pool – people don’t think of healthcare careers beyond doctors and nurses.
The industry needs to be better at selling itself beyond the obvious medical careers.
Cathy Fraser is chief human resources officer of Mayo Clinic , and she shared some of those challenges with the talent shortages. She said she visits middle schools and high schools and asks the students why they’re interested in healthcare. They all say they want to be doctors and nurses. But there are so many other ways to help people live healthy lives.
“One of the best things we also can do is treat healthcare as a vertical, as an industry, it is not a function,” said Fraser. “Kids are taught early that you see yourself as a caregiver in some form because you helped your teddy bear when it got ripped, and you took it to your mommy to give it a band-aid. That’s caregiving. But there’s also the ability to be successful in healthcare as a finance person, as an IT person, as a mechanic, as a glassblower – you can do it because the vertical has every job in it. We have not done a good job as an industry to promote the concept that healthcare is all professions, not just clinical.”
Her own career path includes multiple industries before moving into healthcare. She values a diversity of experience, and has created a structure within the organization for people to move around and experiment with their careers.
“We hire good people and we give them the freedom to do a lot of different things in the organization,” said Fraser. “The guy who was my second person, my next level in HR, just took a job working as the vice chair of administration of research for Mayo Clinic's research organization. You don't typically get someone who's a high-level HR executive going over to run an administration job in research. But we see more and more of that here because we are looking at talented people, and we're rotating them through different roles, sometimes full-time, but sometimes they're only part-time.”
She said people can take a six-month agile staffing opportunity, experience something new, and then come back.
“This allows people to navigate their own careers, and with actually pretty robust programs for tuition reimbursement as well,” she said. “Humans want to learn, they want to expand, they want to grow, but most organizations make it really, really difficult to do something new.”
She said it’s difficult to be a successful CHRO if you've only come up through the HR discipline.
“People meet me, and they'll think, ‘you're in HR, that's odd,’ – I get that a lot,” she said. “It has to do with the fact that when I came out of grad school I was a finance person working for an airline. Then I actually worked at McKinsey & Company and worked on retail and consumer goods. It's that variety of experience that makes it easy for me to see things clearly that are not traditional HR. So the best thing I would ever advise someone who's coming up through HR is to get out of HR, go spend some time somewhere else, enhance your ability to see things from a different view.”
A systematic approach to inclusion.
In the last article I mentioned my conversation with two leaders from the University of Pennsylvania: Jaya Aysola, MD, MPH, assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine and executive director for Penn Medicine Health Equity Initiative; and Eve Higginbotham, SM, MD, is a professor of ophthalmology and vice dean for inclusion and diversity of the Perelman School of Medicine.
They work together to take the concepts of inclusion and equity and translate them into action items that can be operationalized within the health system – focusing on culture to enhance patient care delivery, scientific innovation and retention efforts.
They conducted a qualitative narrative analysis to better understand what can be done to improve inclusion within healthcare organizations.
They said something I agree with wholeheartedly: Some of the first ways in which to operationalize inclusion is to measure it. They looked into identifying the key factors that organizations can look at when they're thinking about inclusion.
Through their study, they found six factors were consistent regardless of subgroup. The study (see link above) offers the details, but I’ll rely on how Dr. Aysola described the results to me.
Overwhelmingly, minorities and women said they feel like there isn’t a level playing field, that standards in general within an organization aren’t applied equally. Many reported micro-affirmations and nepotism at play in favor of white males.
There was also a significant narrative around the silent bystander: “Often, discriminatory remarks or bigoted remarks happen in an environment with many witnesses, who remain silent,” said Dr. Aysola.
She believes empowering those silent witnesses is a key first step in changing an organization’s culture: “It can be as simple as when, in a committee meeting, a female might raise a really wonderful point, then that point is repeated directly by someone else and presented as their own point. That’s an opportunity for the chair to say, ‘Oh, that's really great, Dan, that you highlighted Mary's point.’”
That’s such a concrete way that leaders can operationalize inclusion in the moment and begin to move the culture toward personalization one interaction at a time.
Build trust by building relationships.
How do you take people who are not engaged and are unwilling to show their true individuality if they don't trust leaders? How do you tackle that?
Nikki Sumpter is senior vice president and chief HR officer for Atlantic Health System in New Jersey. I asked her about building trust and her first response was to say: “This is my favorite part of what I do.”
From previous jobs, she shared examples of taking care of employees, addressing issues of living wage, increasing the training that’s available for development. When she joined Atlantic Health she saw that the organization already had a strong foundation of trust. That came in handy as she helped navigate what she described as a tremendous amount of transformation: a new CEO, other new executives, the rollout of a new Electronic Health Record (EHR) system.
“We have to listen,” said Sumpter. “I can focus HR and get a whole bunch of stuff done, but it may not be what the organization needs today. If we can't be inclusive in our thoughts, if we can't get any of that right, you will have silos. How do you break through those barriers? By meeting people where they are, literally. Literally. It's taking things in one bite at a time in building trust. Culture doesn't happen overnight.”
She brought it back to relationships and to making sure HR plays a role in organizational strategy.
“I think relationships are important,” she said. “Start with everyone on the executive team and find out what the priorities are. But it's not enough to just know what their goals are. What role does HR play in every one of the goals? Because all of the work occurs through people. I mean there's nothing that is happening that a person isn't touching. How is HR supporting everyone's goal? If you could figure that out, that's the start.”
To be ready for personalization, you need your people.
It all comes back to people. To individuals.
To return to Anton Andrews from Microsoft: “New challenges are going to be arising constantly in real time. Is your organization making use of the people in it? Is your network making use of the people in it and allowing them to actually cluster around those challenges as they arise, and bring their expertise to those challenges?”
This is the role HR must play in the age of personalization.
At a time when we are personalizing healthcare, HR should be one of the most sophisticated departments in the organization. You’re the ones who can see what needs to be solved at every level throughout the organization, help individuals know what they are uniquely suited to solve for, then connect people so they can cluster around those challenges and work together to overcome them.
You’re the ones who connect all the dots (take this assessment to measure your effectiveness).
In this age of personalization, the role of chief people officer is the most important role in any organization. It’s PEOPLE who will deliver the innovation needed to take advantage of opportunities for growth. It’s PEOPLE who will revolutionize the way you serve patients, employees and your community. It’s PEOPLE who will transform healthcare for this age of personalization."
Are India's Political Parties Ignoring Climate Change?,www.forbes.com,Nives Dolsak and Aseem Prakash,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/prakashdolsak/2019/04/13/are-indias-political-parties-ignoring-climate-change/,"India is the 4 th largest emitter of greenhouse gases behind China, the US , and the EU . In 2018, carbon emissions rose worldwide , primarily due to increased coal consumption in China and India. Although both countries signed the 2015 Paris Agreement, they continue to rely on coal as an important source of energy. This poses a problem for climate change. After all, as the global salience of Asian economies increases, any solution to climate problems must include a massive switch over to renewables in these countries. But India also needs to think about climate change given its extreme vulnerability . Some of these effects are already visible in changed monsoon patterns, higher incidents of heat waves, drought, migration, and so on. However, it is less clear if the Indian electorate has registered the climate threat.
India is a well-functioning democracy with competitive elections and regime change. It is holding parliamentary elections this year from April 11 until May 19. This is the largest exercise of democracy ever, involving about 900 million voters. And citizens are actively engaging in the electoral process, with about 70 percent expected to cast their votes.
How important are climate issues in the Indian elections? Some newspapers report that citizens are demanding climate action . If this is true, we should expect to see political parties talking prominently about their climate policies. We closely examined the election manifestos of the two leading national parties: the Indian National Congress and the BJP .
The good news is that both parties talk about climate issues: by some accounts , this is the first time that major political parties have done so. But what is revealing is how little they talk, and how even this modest climate talk does not feature prominently in their platforms.
Congress’ 55-page manifesto, “ Congress will Deliver ,” lists 52 action items, grouped in six sections: Employment and Growth (6 items), An Economy that Works for All (7 items), Pride in our Hard and Soft power (10 items), Good Governance through Independent and Accountable Institutions, (11 items), Self-esteem for the Deprived (9 items), and A Life of Dignity for All (9 items).
The last section includes item #49, “Environment and Climate Change” and item #50, “ Climate Resilience and Disaster Management.” There is no mention of the Paris Agreement. In the section on Employment and Growth, item #3 (Infrastructure) talks about renewable energy. In this 22,997-word manifesto, only 1,043 words (4.5%) pertain to climate change.
The BJP’s 45-page manifesto, “ Determined India, Empowered India ,” lists 220 action items, grouped in 12 sections: Nation First (14 items), Agriculture and Farmer Welfare – Doubling Farmers Income (29 items), India as the World’s 3rd Largest Economy (22 items), Infrastructure - Foundation of a New India (34 items), Healthy India - Determined India (8 items), Good Governance (29 items), Tomorrow's India (10 items), Education for All (15 items), Women’s Empowerment (14 items), Inclusive Development (27 items), Cultural Heritage (11 items), and Foreign Policy (7 items).
Here as well, there is no mention of the Paris Agreement. Climate change is noted in the section on Infrastructure (item #33 in the list of 34 items in this section), in the context of renewable energy capacity and the International Solar Alliance. Thus, in the BJP's 18,327-word manifesto, only 116 words (0.6%) pertain to climate issues.
In America, the 2018 exit polls reveal that climate change does not figure among the top issues that motivated voting. The Indian story seems no different: climate policy is not dominating the political discourse, especially when it is placed alongside other issues such as jobs and national security. If election manifestos are a glimpse of voters' policy preferences and a preview of the priorities of the next government, this is bad news for India and for the world."
Renewable Energy Could Save $160 Trillion In Climate Change Costs by 2050,www.forbes.com,James Ellsmoor,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/04/14/renewable-energy-could-save-160-trillion-in-climate-change-costs-by-2050/,"In the face of rising global emissions, intensified electrification and an increase in renewable energy could make the difference that ensures we reach future climate goals . With development and energy demands soaring worldwide, there is an opportunity for clean, renewable energy to supplant fossil fuels and take over as the main form of electricity generation. New findings published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) have emphasized the need to scale up efforts to transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy.
A demonstrator is detained for sitting in the road at Oxford Circus in London, Friday, April 12, 2019. Young protestors took to the streets after a government report has revealed that the nation is set to miss its emissions targets.

The Global Energy Transformation: A Roadmap to 2050 outlines how the world can successfully implement large-scale renewable programs that will not only help reduce carbon emissions but improve global socioeconomic development. The analysis provided by IRENA shows that global energy demands are expected to double by 2050, and that 86% of global electrical needs could be met by renewable energy within that same timeframe. A large scale up from current levels, the extra energy load would be carried mostly by wind and solar installations.
Barriers To Change
Despite the optimistic outlook, IRENA warns that more needs to be done in order to reach the goal they anticipated. IRENA’s Director-General Francesco La Camera explains that, “The energy transformation is gaining momentum, but it must accelerate even faster, The UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the review of national climate pledges under the Paris Agreement are milestones for raising the level of ambition. Urgent action on the ground at all levels is vital, in particular unlocking the investments needed to further strengthen the momentum of this energy transformation. Speed and forward-looking leadership will be critical – the world in 2050 depends on the energy decisions we take today.”
Donald Trump says he is imposing new tariffs to ""protect American jobs and American workers."" Trump acted to impose new tariffs on imported solar-energy components and large washing machines in a bid to help U.S. manufacturers.
ASSOCIATED PRESS Whilst the push for renewable energy certainly has its benefits, there remains a wide range of obstacles in the way of their large-scale development and implementation. For example, the past two years have seen the United States’ solar industry lose momentum over President Donald Trump’s tariffs , whilst lawmakers in Australia are failing to adhere to the nation’s COP21 emissions reduction goals and have continued on with their plans to open the world’s largest open-air coal mine despite widespread public condemnation . These political setbacks are relatively widespread and have been reducing the ability of the renewable energy sector to efficiently evolve and develop, and could have a lasting impact on global emissions.
A Time For Action
IRENA’s report has noted that transitions have been slow and that current rates of emission reduction are not in line with global climate goals. The report recommends that nations take more aggressive actions to ensure a quick and effective transition away from fossil fuels that will help reach the previously agreed-upon goals and ensure that mitigation of climate change remains a priority. In order to do so, IRENA advocates for stronger national policy focusing on long-term zero-carbon strategies as well as promoting innovation in the fields of renewable energy, technology and smart-grids.

Commenting on the report’s findings, La Camera said that “The race to secure a climate safe future has entered a decisive phase. Renewable energy is the most effective and readily-available solution for reversing the trend of rising CO2 emissions. A combination of renewable energy with deeper electrification can achieve 75% of the energy-related emission reduction needed.” What La Camera is describing has already happened in many places worldwide - many islands have been leading the charge in renewable energy transitions, and are becoming incubators for energy innovation.
Race Against The Clock
The benefits stemming from embracing clean, renewable energy go a lot farther than just reducing pollution and carbon emissions. IRENA has illustrated the risks of a slow transition, and every year that carbon emissions increase is another year that negatively affects the environment, social welfare, and the wider economy. Likewise, IRENA has also been quick to point out the knock-on effects of a renewable energy transition in its report, outlining how a rapid transition could save the global economy US$160 trillion in costs associated with climate change.

A chinstrap penguin walks past the Quito Glacier near Ecuador's Pedro Vicente Maldonado Research Station on Greenwich Island, Antarctica, which conducts research, develop sscientific exploration and to documents the environmental impacts on glaciers, flora and fauna in the region.
“The shift towards renewables makes economic sense,” emphasizes La Camera, “By mid-century, the global economy would be larger, and jobs created in the energy sector would boost global employment by 0.2%. Policies to promote a just, fair and inclusive transition could maximize the benefits for different countries, regions and communities. This would also accelerate the achievement of affordable and universal energy access. The global energy transformation goes beyond a transformation of the energy sector. It is a transformation of our economies and societies.”
With time of the essence as nations grapple to reduce the current and future effects of climate change, IRENA’s report punctuates the emergency of the situation - but also how beneficial an efficient transition away from fossil fuels will be for the economy."
UFC 236 Results: Dustin Poirier Survives A Thrilling Brawl With Max Holloway To Win Interim Title,www.forbes.com,Brian Mazique,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2019/04/14/ufc-236-results-dustin-poirier-survives-a-thrilling-brawl-with-max-holloway-to-win-interim-title/,"UFC 236's main and co-main events were pretty special on Saturday night in Atlanta. After Israel Adesanya outlasted Kelvin Gastelum to win the UFC interim middleweight title in a thriller, Dustin Poirier dug deep to best Max Holloway for the interim strap in the main event. With the victory, Poirier has assured himself a shot at current UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov in September when he is eligible to return from suspension.
Holloway, who is the reigning UFC Featherweight Champion, came up from 145 pounds to fight Poirier. This was their second meeting as Poirier won the initial bout seven years ago via submission. On Saturday night, he controlled the action with powerful strikes through the first two rounds.

It looked as if he might stop Holloway on a number of occasions, but the rugged Hawaiian weathered the early storms. In the third round, Poirier's pace slowed and Holloway took advantage. While he was bruised and swollen, Holloway still found the mark with some stinging combinations.
Poirier retreated to the cage and after the fight, he admitted he felt things slipping away. In the fourth round, Holloway seemed to have more momentum, but a jumping knee halted him. The strike opened a nasty cut on his forehead and created a visual that likely swayed the judges' perspective of the round.
The final round could have gone either way, but based on the scorecards (49-46x3), it appears all of the judges scored it for Poirier.

Thankfully, the pre-fight hype isn't likely to venture into territories of racism and religion bashing because Poirier is way too classy to initiate that sort of senseless banter. After the bout with Holloway, both he and Poirier showed nothing but respect for their opponent. It was actually a refreshing scene considering what we've dealt with in the lightweight division.
Holloway will likely go back down to featherweight to continue his reign, but it remains to be seen if this loss and the physical toll it will take on him will affect his performance moving forward. Many champions struggle to return to their weight class after moving up–especially when they appear so comfortable in the heavier division.
Nonetheless, there will be a line of contenders at 145 pounds looking to challenge Holloway when he returns to defend his title.
Poirier will have approximately five months to prepare for Nurmagomedov's relentless grappling. It wouldn't be a shock to see him in a main event with Nurmagomedov and McGregor facing Tony Ferguson on the same card. The UFC could also elect to divide the 155-pound puzzle into two separate cards.
Stay tuned, the never boring 155-pound division figures to be entertaining for the remainder of the year."

"UFC 236 Results: Winners, Bonuses And Highlights",www.forbes.com,Brian Mazique,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2019/04/14/ufc-236-results-winners-bonuses-and-highlights/,"What a night of fights. The UFC 236 main card on Saturday at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta–specifically the main and co-main events–were spectacular. ESPN and the UFC probably couldn't have had a better event to kick off the new PPV exclusive deal. In the main event, Dustin Poirier used a strong first two rounds, and gutsy fifth frame to push past Max Holloway via unanimous decision. Poirier captured the UFC interim lightweight title with the win and he is expected to face recognized champion Khabib Nurmagomedov for the undisputed title in September.
Holloway is the current UFC featherweight champion, and he came up to lightweight for this opportunity. He showed great heart and skill, but in the end, it appeared he was too small for Poirier at 155 pounds. This was the second meeting between the two men with Poirier winning the initial battle seven years ago.
As good as the main event was, the co-main event was even better. Israel Adesanya defeated Kelvin Gastelum to become the UFC interim champion. He will now face recognized 185-pound champion Robert Whittaker once he is healthy enough to return to the Octagon.

Getty Adesanya and Gastelum floored each other and landed big shots throughout. However, it was Adesanya who closed the show definitively in the fifth round, just barely missing the stoppage victory as he had Gastelum badly hurt in the closing moments of the round.
As was the case with Poirier in his unanimous-decision win over Holloway, the performance in the final round was more than enough to secure the victory.
UFC President Dana White said the Adesanya-Gastelum fight was one of the best he's ever seen, and I must concur. It was a no-brainer pick for the Fight of the Night, but the UFC didn't want to leave the extraordinary main event in the cold, so Poirier and Holloway shared the honor. All four men were awarded an additional $50,000 for their efforts.

Hackers Are Using Instagram 'Nasty List' To Steal Passwords -- Here's What You Need To Know,www.forbes.com,Davey Winder,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/04/14/hackers-are-using-instagram-nasty-list-to-steal-passwords-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"There is always something going viral on Instagram, that's the beauty of this particular social sharing platform. Unfortunately, the latest Instagram craze is more viral than is healthy. The Nasty List is actually a login credential stealer. What is the Nasty List?
The Nasty List phenomenon seems to have started earlier this week. It first came to my attention when a Reddit user asked if anyone else was having a problem with the Instagram Nasty List. ""I logged onto Instagram yesterday and I had a dm from my sister. It said I was in some kind of Nasty List"" the Reddit user by the name of molecularwolf explained , continuing ""Well I had just woken up and I was kind of out of it so I clicked on it because I was curious. I then realized that it was probably a virus, but too late, I had already clicked.""
The scam works by using compromised accounts to send messages to followers that express shock at them being on the Instagram Nasty List. You can find examples of Nasty List message formats at Bleeping Computer , but these usually start with something like ""OMG your (sic) actually on here at number 38"" or ""WOW. Your (sic) on here!!! ranked 100."" The messages all include a link to the full Nasty List and provide an explanation of why the user is on it. This lands at a convincing looking, but fake, Instagram login page.
What happens next?
If you fail to spot that the URL for the login page is incorrect, as is highly likely as you just want to see why you are on this list, then your login credentials will be scraped. Armed with your now compromised Instagram username and password, the hackers will use this account access to continue distributing the Nasty List messages. They will also, of course, have control of your Instagram account and all that brings with it! What the people behind the Nasty List plan to do with all these compromised Instagram accounts remains to be seen. However, I would be surprised if there isn't a botnet of some kind waiting to make good use of them by way of spamming campaigns or malware distribution.
What to do if you've already clicked on the Nasty List link
Your course of action to recover control of your account will depend on whether the hacker has already changed the email address and phone number associated with it. If they have not, then go to Settings > Privacy and Security > Password and follow the procedure to change your password. If the hackers have already changed your details then you will need to follow the Instagram process for regaining control of a hacked account. You can find full instructions for this here.
What else should you do?
If you are not already using two-factor authentication (2FA) then I recommend you do this immediately. This is a very simple process that will work with apps such as Google Authenticator. Sure, it will add a few seconds to your login time when you use a different device to usual, but it will also prevent scams such as the Nasty List from being able to get control of your account. Full instructions for enabling Instagram 2FA can be found here ."
UFC 236: A Look At The Post-Fight Stats From The Max Holloway Vs. Dustin Poirier Fight,www.forbes.com,Trent Reinsmith,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2019/04/14/ufc-236-a-look-at-the-post-fight-stats-from-the-max-holloway-vs-dustin-poirier-fight/,"Max Holloway and Dustin Poirier had a lot to live up to after the “Fight of the Year” candidate between Israel Adesanya and Kelvin Gastelum that preceded their UFC 236 main event scrap. And while their interim lightweight fight might not have provided the ups and downs of interim middleweight title bout that was won by Adesanya after 25 hard-fought minutes, it didn’t miss that mark by much. UFC 236 took place at State Farm Arena in Atlanta.
The two started cautiously with Poirier leading with leg kicks, but less than two minutes into the round things opened up in a big way as Poirier rushed in with a flurry of strikes. Holloway followed Poirier’s onslaught with some counters, but the advantage remained on Poirier’s side thanks to his boxing skills. Poirier hurt Holloway with powerful punches and looked to have his opponent in danger, but Holloway, who entered the bout as the reigning featherweight champion did his best to stand in the pocket and return fire.

— UFC (@ufc) April 14, 2019
After five minutes, It was Poirier’s power that carried the round. The first round stats favored Poirier, who threw 115 significant strikes and landed 54 of those attempts. Meanwhile, Holloway attempted 72 significant strikes and connected on 30 of those.
At the start of Round 2, Holloway smiled at his foe as the referee started the stanza. He seemed to have fully recovered from the barrage of heavy strikes that he had absorbed during the first five minutes of the contest. Poirier’s pace understandably slowed a bit in the second round while Holloway’s pressure and volume increased. In the last minute of the round, Holloway was rocked by Poirier’s power, but his response was to bounce off the cage and wave his opponent forward.
The second-round stats favored Holloway, but not by much. Holloway landed 32 of 89 significant strikes in the second five minute period, while Poirier connected on 31 of his 74 significant strike attempts.
Poirier’s power and accuracy were the story of the early portion of the third round. Holloway did his best to up his volume, but Poirier’s defensive game was on point as he kept his guard high to avoid Holloway’s punches. Then, in the last minute, Holloway stepped on the gas and upped his volume, which forced Poirier to attempt a takedown. Poirier was unable to put Holloway to the mat and as he leaned into his opponent against the cage, he absorbed several elbows to his head.

The third round featured Holloway’s highest output. He threw 111 significant strikes and landed 53 of those blows. Meanwhile, Poirier attempted 68 significant strikes and landed 33.
Poirier opened the fourth round with a successful takedown, but he was unable to do much more than hold Holloway against the cage before he was able to regain his feet. Once back on the feet, Holloway upped his volume with a good mixture of strikes to the head and body. As the round wore on Poirier looked to be tiring, but his power remained in the blows that he did throw, and he opened a massive cut on the face of Holloway with just over a minute to go in the round.
Holloway talking trash while wearing the crimson mask! Wow! #UFC236 pic.twitter.com/uEtQEjzzn7

Holloway again led the way in volume, throwing 89 significant strikes in the fourth round while landing 42 of those strikes. For his part, Poirier attempted 64 significant strikes and landed 34 of those attempts.
Holloway’s face was swollen and bloody at the start of the fifth and final round, but he was hardly discouraged. The same could be said of Poirier. Holloway’s volume slowed a bit in the fifth, while Poirier continued to look to land his power strikes. With less than a minute to go, Poirier shot for a takedown against the fence and while he didn’t land that takedown, he ate precious time off the clock and prevented Holloway from landing any additional strikes until the two separated in the final ten seconds of the bout and exchanged blows in the open.
The final :10!!

When the final horn sounded, Holloway had landed 24 of the 85 significant strikes he attempted in the fifth stanza, while Poirier connected on 26 of his 60 thrown significant strikes.
As expected, Holloway threw more volume throughout the 25-minute fight, but it was Poirier who was awarded the unanimous decision victory thanks to his power and accuracy. Each of the judges scored the memorable bout 49-46 in favor of Poirier, who after 22 fights in the UFC, claimed a title.
The final stats for the “Fight of the Night” bonus winning affair showed that Holloway connected on 181 of his 446 attempted significant strikes, while Poirier landed 178 of the 381 significant strikes he threw. Holloway did not try any takedowns, but he attempted one submission. For his part, Poirier did not attempt a single submission, but he went one for eight on takedowns attempts. Neither fighter scored a knockdown over the course of the contest.
The loss ended Holloway’s 13-fight winning streak, while at the same time put Poirier’s run of fights without a loss at six."
"Heads Up Tesla And GM: China's Geely Plays The Electric Angle With 'Geometry' Line, New EV",www.forbes.com,Bill Roberson,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billroberson/2019/04/14/heads-up-tesla-and-gm-chinas-geely-plays-the-electric-angle-with-geometry-line-and-a-new-ev/,"Ascendant Chinese carmaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, better known as Geely, has announced a new range of vehicles under the new ""Geometry"" brand and the new lineup includes an all-electric model, the Geometry A, that's close to production. Geely announced that the ""A"" model will be joined by ten more electric vehicles by 2025, and there's little reason to doubt it will happen. Geely says they already have 27,000 preorders for the new EV, a sleek sedan that bears a passing resemblance to the Tesla Model 3.
While Geely isn't a household name in the U.S., it could be soon. The brand has been busily buying up and investing in numerous nameplates and owns both Lotus and Volvo, along with former Volvo performance arm Polestar , which is now a higher-end EV incubator.
The company also has a 50% percent stake in tinycar/EV maker Smart , with the Daimler group holding the other half. In 2018, Geely leadership said their intent was to convert to producing only ""New Energy"" vehicles in the near future . In China, EVs and hybrids are often referred to as ""New Energy"" cars instead of EVs or ""electric cars.""
Geely says cars like the Geometry A are the future as it plans to eventually only produce electric vehicles.
Geely Ltd. The Geometry A, despite the somewhat wonky name that clearly echos Tesla's naming convention, first broke cover as the GE11 and is a sleek four-door saloon focused more on getting people around comfortably than setting low 0 to 60 times (which should be around mid-8 seconds). Geely says the car will be available in six total variants across two range trims, all powered by a single motor setup making just over 160 horsepower.
Battery options include 52kWh and 62 kWh packs, providing claimed ranges of 254 and 310 miles on the NEDC cycle, which should cleave closely to the EPA's range estimator and the eventual EU-wide WLTP range gauge .
Photos of the GE11/Geometry A indicate the car will have a prominent center screen like the Tesla Model 3, but also a small second screen in the area where a traditional speedo usually sits. A head-up display is also on the menu. Other features include a wide range of tech helpers including pedestrian detection with automatic braking, collision warning systems and more. High-res cameras and radars that tie into a moving object detection system are said to give Level 2 autonomous features including lane keeping and lane change assist.
The Head Up Display on the Geely Geometry A.
Geely Ltd. At Chinese market prices of $31,250 and $37,200 respectively for the two range options, the car is clearly targeting the popular Tesla Model 3, which is a hot seller in China. Indeed, Tesla announced its most basic ( and least expensive ) version of the Model 3 will go on sale in China the same day Geely announced the Geometry line. Telsa is also building a factory in China to produce the Model 3 domestically and avoid tariffs. Currently, all Tesla models are imported.
The announcement from Geely should give automakers pause worldwide. Despite the fact that auto markets are currently in decline in China , Geely is clearly taking a long view of the ""New Energy"" EV market. Their success in turning around Volvo's fortunes indicates they are looking well outside their borders, and U.S carmakers would do well to recall the sudden rise of carmakers from another Asian country, Japan, who were initially dismissed as making substandard and unappealing cars.
Like the Tesla Model 3, the Geometry A features a large central touchscreen but also includes a second small screen behind the steering column.
Geely Ltd. How and if the Geely EVs will ever come to the U.S. is unknown, considering the current administration's protective stance and penchant for tariffs, but Geely clearly has global ambitions and says that the majority of the Geometry A preorders have come from outside China, including from EU countries. Outside of Tesla, GM seems to be the only legacy American carmaker with a viable EV at this time, the Chevy Bolt, with other players expected to join the EV party in the near future.
Geely's sub-$40,000 Geometry A should provide even more impetus to get American EV efforts into high gear as more and more drivers worldwide begin to better understand the benefits (and general fun) of driving cars that don't require gasoline."
Three Jewelry Veterans See Lab-Grown Diamonds Sold Online The Future And Launch Clean Origin,www.forbes.com,Pamela N. Danziger,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2019/04/14/clean-origin-is-three-jewelry-veterans-answer-to-the-industrys-future-lab-grown-diamonds-online/,"Clean Origin is what happens when three deeply-embedded jewelry industry executives put their heads together to create a business aimed at the future of the jewelry market—Millennials and GenZ customers. Clean Origin sells the jewelry Millennials and GenZs want–lab-grown diamonds—the way they want to buy them—online—and at lower prices—more bling for the buck.
Clean Origin is the brainchild of Alexander Weindling, third-generation diamond merchant and former global managing director for Georg Jensen; Ryan Bonifacino, former chief marketing officer and digital vice president of Alex and Ani, one of the fastest-growing jewelry brands in the U.S.; and Terry Burman, who served as CEO for Signet Jewelers, Sterling Jewelers and chairman Zale Corporation, and is now chairman of the board for Abercrombie and Fitch and Tuesday Morning,
Starting first with bridal jewelry, Weindling tells me it is only the beginning for Clean Origin. “With Terry as chairman of our board of advisors, we are only in our infancy. You can read a lot into that.”
Weindling affectionately refers to Burman as his company’s Obi-Wan Kenobi.
The origin of Clean Origin
All three company principals took a hiatus from the jewelry industry, giving them a unique outsiders’-insiders’ perspective of the industry. “We were done with the trade,” Weindling shared with me.
I went on to be a private equity hack, but people keep calling me with the lab-grown diamond transition. Once I saw that you can make real gemstone-quality diamonds with no visible difference – Understand, I was trained in diamonds since I was in diapers and I couldn’t see the difference – I got to thinking about the customer and the problems they had and how to make it better.
Alex Weindling, co-founder Clean Origin
Courtesy of Clean Origin A business plan was hatched which Weindling took to the best person he knew to shoot holes in it.
“I called Terry and said I have this mad idea to run by you, ” Weindling says . “ I talked for an hour and he didn’t say anything. I had been there before with Terry and he ripped me apart. I expected the same. But when I stopped talking about this new idea, all he said was ‘Flawless.’”
Not only did Burman give his stamp of approval, but he became a seed investor in the company that was to become Clean Origin. He wanted in because, “We are at the infancy of a market share shift,” Burman explains.
“It is partly the result of technology that allows gem-quality diamonds to be produced. But consumers now accept that these lab-produced diamonds are chemically and visually the same as mined diamonds and serve the same purpose,” he continues, but with the added benefit that lab-grown diamonds are more affordable.
“These young couples are just starting out and their budgets are pressed. They can make a choice for a bigger diamond or a better color or better quality without overrunning their budgets,” Burman says. “It is a great opportunity for them to get the diamond ring they really want.”
The Clean Origin difference
The seed idea for Clean Origin started with a focus on the consumer, specifically the next-generation Millennials and GenZ customers who are either in or getting ready to enter the bridal jewelry market. “The younger generation have a very principled approach to the environment,” Weindling observes.
Therefore the company sells only lab-grown stones. “We don’t touch a mined diamond. We are very pure about that,” he says.
“We set out to do something very simple: win on price, win on product selection and have the best possible customer experience with a team of experts that don’t win unless the customer wins,” Bonifacino adds.
Clean Origin lab-grown diamond jewelry selections
Courtesy of Clean Origin Plenty of venture capital dollars are backing other direct-to-consumer “disrupter” jewelry brands because of the market share shift that Burman refers to. So far Clean Origin has resisted that temptation, relying instead on the team’s years of experience in the jewelry business.
“ What we are building is the ultimate fusion of modern DTC expertise and generations of supply-chain mastery led by actual jewelry-industry veterans , unlike others that only bring one side of the equation,” Bonifacino says. “Digitally-native brands without jewelry expertise lack value creation, while legacy brands are tone deaf to the evolving needs and expectations of the new consumer.”
“We are jewelers and that is a huge difference,” Weindling adds. “We are looking to win through truth and transparency.”
As Burman sees it, the company’s expertise in all that goes into creating a beautiful piece of diamond jewelry is a huge advantage for Clean Origin.
“Alex [Weindling] spent a lifetime not just in diamonds but in the jewelry business. He knows how to source the best-quality rings with the best materials and mountings. Our offering is well rounded, high quality and we offer great service along with the purchase of a diamond,” he says.
In addition to selling set lab-grown diamond rings which are custom-crafted and delivered in nine days, Clean Origin also offers larger CVD (carbon vapor deposition) stones with overnight delivery. But like mined diamonds, these higher-quality CVD gemstones are in short supply.
“This is complex materials science. There aren’t that many people who have the secret sauce,” Weindling shares.
Lab-grown diamond market feels growing pains
As we closed our discussion, I asked about the push back against lab-grown diamonds from the traditional mined-diamond industry. “Any new technology is going to face resistance,” Burman says and predicts, “ As the market shifts, eventually most if not all companies are going to want to get into this product. ”
Weindling gets more philosophical. “This is existential for them. If they can kill lab-growns, then they will. But I am not here to say anything bad about anyone else, so why are they?”
Clean Origin’s answer, according to Weindling, is to give people a choice with truth and transparency.
At the same time, some lab-grown companies are testing the limits of last year’s Federal Trade Commission’s new guidelines. Under those guidelines, the FTC allowed companies that sell lab-growns to call their products “diamonds” as long as that word “is immediately preceded with equal conspicuousness by the word ‘laboratory-grown,’ ‘ laboratory-created,’ ‘[ manufacturer name ]-created,’ or some other word or phrase of like meaning, so as to disclose clearly the nature of the product and the fact it is not a mined gemstone.”
Late last month the FTC sent letters to eight lab-grown diamond companies, including Diamond Foundry and seven others not identified , claiming some of their website, Instagram and Twitter ads may not comply with its ruling or that their claims of environmental responsibility may not be backed up by reliable data.
Weindling reports that Clean Origin did not receive one of those letters and “ will not receive one as we have, from inception, been ahead of the FTC and in full compliance.” He further said that after hearing about the FTC letters, they had the company attorney, who was formerly the lead counsel for the FTC, confirm their status.
“The FTC’s job is to protect consumers,” responds Weindling. “The FTC is trying to be the arbiter for the truth to the consumer and I applaud it. Truth is our friend.”
On the other hand, he takes issue with the “mining interests that are seriously trying to denigrate the value and perception of lab-grown diamonds.”
That effort will undoubtedly continue as the consumer market continues to shift as they learn more about this less expensive man-made alternative to mined diamonds with the same composition and visually identical without special equipment.
As for the environmental claims, Weindling says, “I am not a scientist, but when open-pit mines are visible from space, I am confident other non-scientists will prefer lab-grown diamonds.”
“Our ambition in bringing lab-grown diamonds to a new generation of consumers is centered around the fundamental belief that a new standard has to be set which starts with sharing generations of expertise through the digital conversation,” Bonifacino says.
Burman gets back to the fundamentals. “In any retail business, you always must think of putting the customer in the center of it. In this case, it is a product they want and that they can buy at a better price.”"
"5G Vs. 5GE Vs. 4G LTE Spring 2019: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint -- Quick Compare",www.forbes.com,Brooke Crothers,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookecrothers/2019/04/14/5g-vs-5ge-vs-4g-lte-spring-2019-att-verizon-t-mobile-sprint-quick-compare/,"The next generation of mobile wireless broadband is here. Well, actually, not yet. First things first: one of the most important things to remember is that you will need a new 5G-capable device (with new chips) to tap into the speed of 5G.
5G: think 2020
Verizon has limited 5G service in select cities now . Sprint will very soon (May). AT&T has begun offering 5G+ (a steppingstone to real 5G via its Nighthawk ""Mobile 5G device "" ) and AT&T and T-Mobile and others are offering advanced 4G LTE (what AT&T calls 5GE).
When widely available, full-bore 5G is expected to offer peak speeds that are 10 to to 20 times faster* than 4G. And with very low latency, lag times will be ""nearly impossible to detect,"" according to Verizon.
With gigabit speeds and extremely low latency, 5G has the potential to radically change the experience on your phone, mobile device or car. For example, 5G could bring a quantum leap in AI and augmented reality, a new level of telemedicine , better gaming on mobile devices, and true self-driving cars , to mention a few.
It should also allow some consumers to switch to 5G in the home from standard TV cable service.
Verizon 5g moto mod.
Credit: Verizon 5G Price:
Excluding the steep cost of a new 5G-capable device or necessary add-ons (like the 5G Moto Mod or AT&T Nighthawk), pricing plans range from no added cost (T-mobile) to $10/month for customers who have Verizon's unlimited data plan. But expect pricing updates from carriers later this year as 5G service ramps up.
5G Evolution** (5GE):
This is what AT&T calls its ""first step on the road to 5G."" In the real world, it's actually similar to advanced 4G LTE ( see this study from Opensignal ). That said, AT&T's goal is to provide 2X faster speeds than existing the LTE network.
AT&T explains here how it's trying to make 5GE faster, including carrier aggregation, which combines two or more carriers into one data channel. But note that other carriers offer these technologies too. Here's an explanation from Sprint , which also offers advanced 4G LTE tech such as carrier aggregation, 4X4 MIMO, and 256-QAM .
4G LTE: this is what most users in the U.S. connect to and will continue to use through much of 2019. Upgraded/advanced 4G LTE is more or less what AT&T calls 5GE.
----
NOTES:
*Verizon told me that in Minneapolis and Chicago, early 5G mobility speeds are an average of 450 megabits per second with peak speeds around 1 gigabit per second (gbps). Peak (theoretical) speeds for 5G in the future range from 10gbps to 20gbps.
**If you upgrade to iOS 12.2 and you are an AT&T user, you may see a ""5GE"" icon in place of the usual ""LTE"" for the phone's cellular connection."

And once potential customers are made aware of all the good things you have to offer, the orders will begin to flood in.
But according to new research carried out by digital product developer, Studio Graphene, many of Britain’s early stage businesses are being held back by marketing and communications strategies that fail to ignite the interest of target customers. Or to be more precise, the marketing collateral deployed by young companies often confuses potential buyers, rather than telling them anything useful about the products and services on offer.
As founder and director, Ritam Gandhi explains, Studio Graphene creates “blank canvas” digital products for startups and corporate businesses. If a company requires, say, an app to help it execute its business plan, Studio Graphene will carry out all the necessary development and testing work. From that perspective, the company was keen to find out more about the reaction of customers - mainly in the consumer space - to the branding and marketing of new digital products.
What’s In A Name
So, Studio Graphene asked around 2,000 people from across the U.K. to look at ten company names and logos. Respondents were then asked to match the names and visual identities to descriptions of each company’s business model. All the businesses had recently secured Series A funding.
With one exception - the brand names chosen were not sector or product specific, and the research suggests that this could create a marketing problem. On average only 21 percent of respondents were able to connect either the name or logo to the sector or the nature of the business. The best performer was healthcare analytics company, Medopad, with 41 percent of those taking part, connecting it to the ""healthtech"" sector. Providing a clue clearly helps.
Should anyone be particularly worried about this? After all, the world’s biggest brands go to market with names that say little or nothing about the products they sell. For instance, Nike only says sportswear to consumers because it spends a lot of marketing cash establishing the connection.
But arguably young companies - or indeed any business that doesn’t have infinitely deep pockets - should at least think about the first impression made by their name or logo. More than half of those surveyed (55 percent) complained that too many businesses had obscure names. Perhaps more importantly, 62 percent said they would avoid contact with businesses that did not have a clear proposition.
The Trouble With Advertising
Perhaps none of this is surprising. As Gandhi acknowledges: “Businesses tend to start out by thinking about the product. They only start to think about the logo when it’s got to the stage where something has to go up on screen.” As he sees it, this misses an opportunity to create the visual identity - along with the brand name - at an earlier point in the development process.
You could argue, of course, the real heavy lifting is done by advertising and other forms of information-rich communication. But advertising, it seems, is not always effective when it comes to getting a message across. For instance, 51 percent of respondents said they regularly saw advertisements across a range of media that failed to properly explain the products or services that were being advertised.
“That means that about half of all advertising is wasted,” says Gandhi.
That’s probably an overstatement, but there is often a communications problem when tech-driven businesses begin to sell themselves to the public. As a business writer, I spend a lot of time looking at company websites as part of my background research ahead of interviews. Very often, the information provided fails to really explain the business and its product offering.
Gandhi’s advice is to communicate clearly. “Feel confident about your brand and the way you present it,” he says. “And it’s important to make sure that your message is always very, very clear. You should always make sure that people know what you are doing.”
Of course, a great many online businesses make their positioning clear from the outset. Read the name Deliveroo or WeBuyAnyCar and you instantly have a pretty good idea of what those companies do to earn their daily corn. But if the branding is less obvious, the research suggests that businesses will need to ensure that the rest of their messaging is razor sharp, if they are to engage their target audience.

Masters Leader Molinari Continues A Remarkable Transformation,www.forbes.com,Matthew Cooper,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewjcooper/2019/04/14/masters-leader-molinari-continues-a-remarkable-transformation/,"What a difference a year makes. Twelve months ago Francesco Molinari posted rounds of 72-74-70-70 to claim a tie for 20th at Augusta National, a performance that was typical of the golfer he was.
This week the Italian has completed laps of 70, 67 and 66 to lead the Masters by two strokes with 18 holes to play – a demonstration of the golfer he has become.
The transformation of Molinari, from Fiat to Ferrari, is a lesson to all about the capacity to implement change.
Back in late 2016 he sat down with his team and determined that the status quo was earning him a handsome living, but was failing to reap the very greatest rewards that were within his scope.
He redoubled efforts with his long-term swing instructor Denis Pugh and also began working with putting expert Phil Kenyon and performance coach Dave Alred. He wanted them to ask difficult questions of him, never stinting in his desire to become the best he could be.
And yet, as if often the case for golfers, all that graft still required a mental trigger.
It came in May last year when he arrived at TPC Sawgrass for the Players Championship: Pugh spotted something awry in his charge’s swing, Molinari felt fine, waved away the concerns … and then missed the cut at a venue where he had finished top seven in his previous three visits.
The 36-year-old was furious at his own carelessness and yet it would bear remarkable fruit because throughout the season that followed he and Pugh would recall it every single time he left the range, as if that one moment of complacency had crystallized the fear which had driven the original desire to refute a good career and seek a great one.
Ever since Molinari has shed the cloaks that smothered him in the past, like a member of the chorus who has stepped center stage at La Scala .
His very next start was the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth, a flagship event on the European Tour and one in which he had led at the end of a round three times in the previous five years. It represented his career in microcosm: a superb ball-striker on a course that demanded it; a nearly man who didn’t win as often as he should.
However, this time he shot 66-68 at the weekend to claim the title, going head-to-head with Rory McIlroy and leaving the Northern Irishman gasping: “He’s like a robot, he never hit anything offline.”
Five weeks later he led the Quicken Loans National on the PGA Tour with 18 holes to play. Victory in the States had always eluded him, but not now – he carded a 62 to destroy the field by eight shots.
At the end of July he traveled to Carnoustie, a course he had never played well on, for the Open Championship, a tournament he had only briefly excelled in. Moreover, he had collected just one top-five finish from 35 major championships starts.
In that week he was supreme, defeating the course, the course demons, a stacked leaderboard, his final round playing partner Tiger Woods and the rowdy Tiger gallery to lift the Claret Jug.

ASSOCIATED PRESS In September he didn’t so much star for Europe in the Ryder Cup as lead the continent’s charge for victory. A man who just six months earlier had suggested he lacked something in the “cut-throat” atmosphere of match play won all five of his matches.
Just last month he rubber-stamped that metamorphosis by finishing third in the WGC World Match Play, three weeks after a stellar 64 saw him gatecrash victory in the Arnold Palmer Invitational.
This week at Augusta National was set for another test of this compelling shift in class.
Molinari had broken 70 just once in 24 rounds of the famous course before his arrival this year. That top 20 last year was his second in seven starts, his best was just T19th and he had only once found himself in the top ten at the end of any round.
On Saturday he had not yet teed off in the final two-ball when his share of the halfway lead was being assaulted by those out on the course. The scoring was low and the pressure to maintain the pace was intense.
On Friday he had acknowledged the knife-edge reality of playing golf at Augusta. “I feel a massive difference when I’m on and around the greens compared to my previous times here,” he said. “But it’s still pretty uncomfortable when you’re standing over some putts or chips because the margins are so small.”
His response was a bogey-free 66, finding 13 greens in regulation and saving par every time he missed the putting surface: he was negotiating those fine lines.
“I was mentally very good,” he said afterward. “I played the back nine probably as good as I’ve ever played here. My plan for tomorrow is to go out and do the same, but I think there’s going to be a few guys trying to mess up with my plan.”
Victory would elevate his standing in the game, but he is right to be cautious. The course has yielded birdies this week, the wind promises to be a capricious final day element, and threats loom on the leaderboard, none more so than Tiger Woods, two back and one of his final round playing partners.
Whether he leaves Georgia with or without a green jacket Molinari will recognize this is a long game. He has once again reiterated that change is possible and that often it is provoked not by perfection, but by mistakes."
Imitation IS The Sincerest Form Of Flattery: How The Chicken Franchise Called Out Its Copycats,www.forbes.com,Fiona Simpson,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/fionasimpson1/2019/04/14/imitation-is-the-sincerest-form-of-flattery-how-the-chicken-franchise-called-out-its-copycats/,"KFC and the Colonel with his “top secret recipe” – they’ve been around since the 1930's and franchising successfully since 1950. KFC is now the world’s second biggest fast food chain – with over 22000 locations worldwide , and with around 900 outlets here in the UK alone, of which 95% are franchisees. The KFC branding is of course also instantly recognizeable – the Colonel’s face and the bold 3 letter intials together with their trademark color red. As a franchisor, I share two things in common with the Colonel and his crew. Firstly, our main brand color is also a very bright red. But secondly, we’ve also recently come across (yet again) the age old issue of copycats.
Copycats are incredibly frustrating for any business owner or entrepreneur, whether in the world of franchising or not. You spend so much time (and money!) developing your product, service and brand. And then someone simply copies it and tries to hang onto your coat tails. Grrr!
If you've got a great product or service, it's inevitable that this will happen at some point in your business journey - no sector will be immune - and at the end of the day, people won't copy rubbish ideas, only great ones! It happens endlessly in the franchise industry – people see franchise networks growing successfully, seem to think that franchising is a licence to print money and that it’s an easy route to go down. However generally speaking, those copycats have taken a quick overview, underestimated the challenges of franchising, don’t fully appreciate the systems and processes that are needed behind the scenes and that are the backbone to the success of the franchise brand, and don’t last the course.
When I first started out in business, copycats would give me sleepless nights. I would cry out of frustration and worry endlessly. However, as time went on and I developed more experience, more confidence and importantly resilience, I relatively quickly realized that fretting about copycats is a complete waste of time and energy. Anyone who is unable to come up with their own creative ideas is always going to be several steps behind us. The key is to continue to focus on what we do, do it brilliantly and remember that whilst someone can try to emulate us, they will never BE us. As a franchisor, I do still have to provide reassurance to our franchisees who come across copycats in their individual territory areas and remind them of this fact whilst supporting them through that emotional rollercoaster – one of the big benefits of being part of a wider team!
It’s always reassuring to see that the big franchise brands aren’t immune from copycats either – and it was amusing to see how KFC recently turned things around and called their copycats out, using them to their own marketing advantage! KFC is already known as a brand for their savvy marketing – turning a disaster into a triumph in 2018 when their new logistics partner in the UK failed them and restaurants across the UK ran out of chicken! Using a cheeky anagram of their 3 letter name, their marketing response went viral.
And this month, KFC released a new marketing campaign in the UK , taking a humorous swipe at the thousands of imitator chicken fast food outlets across the country with the simple line “Guys, we’re flattered”. It’s also paired with a TV ad showing the Colonel cruising down the streets in a limo past the various imitator restaurants before reminding us that the original chicken recipe is only available at KFC.
This article isn’t about protecting your franchise brand – all franchisors will know the importance of getting your IP rights in order before heading down the route of franchising. Of course, as a brand leader and franchisor you should always take appropriate steps to protect your brand and challenge direct copycats if they are legally infringing your protected rights – that’s part of your duty to your franchise network.
However, what KFC have shown us is that the key to dealing with the annoyance of imitators is to remain confident in your brand. Don’t let copycats get inside of your head and detract you from your own business. Instead, turn their actions and your responding emotions into a positive you can use – whether that be in humorous marketing as KFC have done, or using the energy to spur you on and drive your own business to the next level. Make sure you keep your face and personality at the forefront of your business – as I said earlier, no one can copy that. Continue to innovate within your brand.
As you continue to stride forward in your own business journey (whether that be in franchising or otherwise), copycats will be chasing along behind you, always several steps behind. But remember - just like the Colonel, those pretenders will never be able to steal your own brand ""top secret recipe"" for success."
China's Philanthropic Growth Drives World's Next Big Impact Powerhouse,www.forbes.com,Deepali Khanna,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/deepalikhanna/2019/04/14/chinas-philanthropic-growth-drives-worlds-next-big-impact-powerhouse/,"This article was co-authored with Naina Batra, CEO of the Asian Venture Philanthropy Network. Philanthropy in China has grown exponentially, with charitable giving growing 20% year-on-year , compared to GDP growth of between 6% and 7% annually. Despite being a new joiner to global philanthropy (interest in charitable giving surged in 2008 following the Sichuan earthquake and has been growing ever since), Chinese philanthropy is evolving from reactive or cause-driven giving to designing interventions for long-term, transformative change.
According to a report released this month by AVPN (Asian Venture Philanthropy Network ) , supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, the total amount of charitable giving in China had quadrupled between 2009 and last year, reaching $23.4 billion. Meanwhile, the number of social enterprises registered in the country increased by 17% between 2017 and 2018. This increase has not only nurtured an ecosystem that enables investors to make impact-conscious decisions, but also fosters talent and trust within the sector to develop the next generation of changemakers.
AVPN
China is undoubtedly beginning to flex its muscles as a catalyst and driver for achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Historically, philanthropic activity in the country sought to secure the fundamentals of well-being, with most Chinese philanthropists focusing their giving in education, poverty alleviation, social welfare, healthcare and disaster relief at home. But as China’s economic power rises on the global stage, so do its ambitions to make an impact elsewhere. Chinese philanthropists are beginning to look further afield, and they are leveraging their strengths in technology to drive new models of giving.
Built from innovation
At the center of what modern philanthropy looks like in China sits cutting-edge technology that's harnessing the country’s thriving digital services sector to spark greater impact. Tencent matches mobile donations made via WeChat to their own charitable donations, while Alipay and Ant Financial leverage user-recorded low-carbon footprint data to reverse desertification in real life. Yidu Cloud has shown the same dynamism working alongside top medical establishments in China with the aim of providing better healthcare to patients by curating quality data to researchers through its cloud platform, advanced machine learning and AI technology. These ongoing contributions by Chinese tech Goliaths–and the rising Davids–illustrate how digital innovation empowers out-of-the-box approaches to solve the SDGs.
We’re also seeing innovation in the way lines are blurring between business and impact. According to the report, about 65% of philanthropic giving in China is driven by corporate foundations, a space historically dominated by non-profits. Businesses large and small also no longer see social value as an add-on but a fundamental part of their value proposition. Solutions like Shuidi Chou –an insurance platform that crowdfunds health payments for those who cannot afford it–is worth 710 million yuan ($105.8 million), and impact investment pioneer E-Hong Capital tells us they’re seeing returns at market rate. CASVI’s SV99 , an index that tracks the top 300 companies in China on the basis of Environmental and Social Governance (ESG), has been outperforming benchmark indices in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. China also boasts the largest number of millionaires engaged in ESG-related investments and corporate donations in the country. Overall, China now ranks as one of the top three countries in the world for cumulative green bond issuance.
Bracing the momentum
China’s philanthropic sector is developing in an exciting, accelerated and some might say frenzied pace. With this dynamism comes the challenge of securing these foundations. Indeed, while the total amount of philanthropic giving and the mechanisms by which capital is aggregated and deployed are mushrooming, we must pay attention to nurturing a well-developed philanthropic ecosystem.
In 2017, roughly 6,322 domestic foundations operated in China, with fewer than 2,000 registered in 2009. Yet, less than 1% of these foundations are making grants, preferring to run their own programs independently. The global philanthropic community should view this gap as an opportunity to carve new pathways that will not only elevate China’s philanthropic ecosystem, but also enhance our collective ability to solve the global goals. Through partnerships, international organizations and Chinese philanthropists can break new grounds in addressing the world’s most pressing issues. They can facilitate unfettered access to trustworthy networks that share resources and propel co-investment across international development issues, and scale them up for greater impact. The importance of intermediaries in this process cannot be understated; facilitators, connectors and capacity builders are key to bridging the gap and improving accountability between funders and organizations with a social purpose, ultimately accelerating the quantum of capital deployed to uplift people and communities in the most effective and sustainable ways possible.
Financial and technological innovation, and a pathway for strategic and reinforcing collaboration, are the building blocks of a thriving philanthropic community. Only with a diverse and inclusive set of players can the philanthropic community ensure that resources are utilized effectively to achieve greater social impact. Building a vibrant, robust philanthropic ecosystem is not an easy endeavour; it will require patience, a long-term outlook, and a strong disposition for open collaboration. China is a philanthropic powerhouse, and if we get this right, China’s givers and change-makers have the potential not only to shape the well-being of millions of vulnerable people domestically, but can unleash a force for good at a scale yet unseen around the world."
Montegrappa's Game Of Thrones Tells The Story,www.forbes.com,Nancy Olson,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nancyolson/2019/04/14/montegrappas-game-of-thrones-tells-the-story/,"It’s probably safe to assume that Game of Thrones fans will be glued to their seats Sunday night for the premiere of the eighth—and final—season of the blockbuster show on HBO. The large ensemble cast has captivated audiences since the award-winning series premiered in April of 2011, and the worldwide viewership has broken records. Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, the series is an adaptation of the fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, A Song of Ice and Fire , the first of which is A Game of Thrones . This final season comprises just six episodes, and it includes original content not found in Martin’s series but rather it adapts material he will purportedly include in upcoming novels in the series, The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring .
Game of Thrones Pen
Montegrappa’s newest Cult series limited edition pen, Winter Is Here, is crafted in conjunction with HBO, and it is the latest design from the Italian pen brand with the “Game of Thrones” imprint. “An orgy of precious metals and ice-blue apatite,” according to Montegrappa, the precious metal pens pay homage to the mysterious forces from north of The Wall.
Lost wax casting, an ancient art form often used in art and jewelry making, brings the inhabitants of Always Winter, the name given to the lands that lie in the furthest north of the continent of Westeros, to life in Montegrappa style. Three-dimensional effigies of the Night King and White Walker, seemingly back-to-back, form a “superstructure” that encases the pen’s pearlescent celluloid barrel, and the pen’s cap features the figure of Viserion, with the dragon’s tongue of ice protruding from its head and ingeniously forming the pen’s clip. Crystal blue enamel creates the flames encircling the base of the celluloid cap, while blue apatite gems conjure the cold eyes of the beings of the North on the barrel.
The pens are available in very limited numbers —300 fountain pens (with 18-karat gold nib available in six sizes) and 300 rollerball pens in silver and just seven fountain pens and seven rollerball pens in 18-karat gold. But some great-looking regular edition pens are also available, in larger quantities.
This collection follows an earlier limited edition Game of Thrones -themed collection, The Iron Throne , which was also produced in conjunction with HBO and also part of the company’s Cult series. This collection comprises 300 fountain pens and 300 rollerball pens in sterling silver and seven fountain pens and seven rollerball pens in 18-karat gold. The imagery includes the swords of the seven kingdoms, one embellished with a fiery red ruby, surrounding the cap, while the body of the celluloid pen is decorated with a sterling and gold lost wax-cast Game of Thrones décor.
Winter is Here is another example of Montegrappa’s expertise in creating truly fanciful writing instruments that delight both pen and art lovers. Check out the Bassano del Grappa-based company’s other sculptural pens, such as the Samurai , with fully movable parts, released last year. Another favorite of mine, the recently released Moon Landing Limited Edition pays homage to this year’s 50 th anniversary of the epic event for which it is named, with a rocket thruster-inspired blindcap that simulates the Saturn V’s second and third stage separation when turned.
But first, enjoy Game of Thrones , airing tonight. We’ve been waiting."

Burger King Serves Up Subscription Coffee,www.forbes.com,Shep Hyken,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2019/04/14/burger-king-serves-up-subscription-coffee/,"Last month Burger King announced that it would start a coffee subscription program . The short version of this story is that for just $5 each month, you can come in every day for a cup of coffee. That comes out to about 17 cents per cup. This promotion supports Burger King’s launch of the new BK Café lineup of fresh brewed and premium coffee drinks. One of the Burger King ads included the tagline, “Enjoy BK Café for a month for the price of a large cappuccino from Starbucks.” The subscription works through the Burger King app that can be downloaded onto a customer’s smartphone. It’s a good move for Burger King, as it not only potentially gets customers into its restaurants more often, it also promotes the use of the app. Anytime you can get a customer to engage with your app on a regular basis, you’re building up some level of loyalty.
This is more than a clever way to get people into the restaurant. It’s a full-on attack against the competition, which leads to the big question: is it enough to get new customers to come in – and get more customers to come back?
This is not about selling a cup of coffee. The true goal is to get more customers to come into the restaurant and order something else off the menu. Burger King is capitalizing on an opportune moment, as reports indicate that breakfast is today’s fastest growing and most profitable opportunity in the QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) industry. McDonald’s, Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks have promoted breakfast specials for years. For example, McDonald’s offers some items for “a limited time,” such as McCafé Donut Sticks and McCafé Bagels with Nutella.
What intrigues me more than anything is that a restaurant has come up with a way to compete using a subscription model. This model is becoming a normal and accepted way of doing business in many areas beyond the traditional newspapers and magazines. Subscriptions have expanded to software, known as SaaS (Subscription as a Service). This has been working well for the past few years. Now you can subscribe to just about anything, from dog food to razor blades to cars and much more. Companies that offer subscription models recognize the added value to their bottom lines with recurring revenue. They also recognize the value to their customers in the form of convenience.
For this to work, the customer must first buy the subscription, which I don’t think will be an issue. Price isn’t an issue either; it’s so low that it won’t be a barrier to entry. The key is for the customer to use it. A subscription that doesn’t offer value means that the customer won’t subscribe or, even worse, that they might be left with a negative feeling about ever subscribing, to begin with. By using an app, Burger King can track a customer’s usage. So, if they see the customer hasn’t been in for a while, they can push out a personalized message through the app directly to the customer.
Burger King’s $5 subscription for a cup of coffee is a brilliant strategy. It’s “CaaS” … Coffee as a Service. At worst, it’s a loss leader. At best, it’s a brilliant marketing strategy. So, what’s next? A hamburger and french fries subscription? If so, sign me up!"
"Why ""Doing Your Best"" Is A Better Bet than ""Being The Best""",www.forbes.com,Remy Blumenfeld,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/remyblumenfeld/2019/04/14/why-doing-your-best-is-a-better-bet-than-being-the-best/,"If you're reading Forbes, you may already have embraced your own ambitious streak. No matter what you're trying to accomplish, with thousands of other people trying to do the same thing, it surely helps to be driven. After all, most of the greatest entrepreneurs, politicians, scientists, and artists were perpetually striving to beat their personal best or challenge the status quo. Yet being driven to succeed should not be confused with the kind of competitive ambition that can consume you. So, do you need to be competitive with others, and what is the essential difference between ""being the best"" and ""doing your best""? Let's start by finding out where you are on the spectrum of ambition. Are you someone with a driving need to:
A.
Win arguments Exceed other people's standards and expectations Out-perform others Innovate for the sake of being ahead Be the best B.
Beat your own personal bests Push yourself to master new skills Do the very best at what you do Rely on your own drive to be better If you answered mostly A, you're more competitive with others, put yourself first and are therefore less suited to collaboration. You're in the zone of being the best. Because you're often distracted by who's in front and who's behind and because let's face it, it's hard to know whether you ever really are ""the best,"" it's likely you feel disappointed and stressed out.
Whenever my competitiveness surfaces, I feel tense and anxious in the pit of my stomach. My heart beat accelerates and my breathing becomes faster and shallower.
If you answered mostly B, your ambition is of the kind favored by corporations. You may be driven, but you're still able to collaborate usefuly. You're more about doing your best . Because, instead of competing with other people you are setting your own benchmarks for success, it's likely that you feel more relaxed and in control.
When I'm simply doing my best, I feel excited rather than anxious. There is no tension in my body and I feel present and at ease. My heartbeat and breathing are normal, because I'm not in a race.
Ambition can be all about achieving success on your own terms, whereas competitiveness means striving to be more successful than others.
The key, says psychiatrist and author Dr. Neel Burton, is to pursue healthy ambition - not looking over your shoulder at how others are faring, but simply doing your best: “People with a high degree of healthy ambition are those with the insight and strength to control the blind forces of ambition, shaping [it] so that it matches their interests and ideals. They harness it so that it fires them without also burning them or those around them.""
The main difference between my British and American clients is their attitude towards the whole spectrum of ambitious behavior. In the USA, ""taking care of Number One"" is not only accepted but encouraged, whereas in Britain all personal ambition has long been considered to be vulgar. In Britain, you can make your way right to the very top of the corporate or social ladder, just so long as no one sees you climbing.
A British executive interviewed by Sam Friedman and Daniel Laurison, in their devastating new book The Class Ceiling: Why it Pays to be Privileged , describes the accepted code at work: “ It was instantly recognizable to me, exactly like the common rooms at school and at Oxford. The rules are: it’s good to be right, but it’s better to be funny!”
However, whereas naked ambition is often encouraged in the USA, corporations on both sides of the Atlantic tend to avoid hiring people with a competitive streak. That's because being the best means putting yourself first. It is the opposite of being collaborative.
Here are six questions to help you with the distinction of doing your best:
Do you Accept Your Own Ambition?
You may judge all ambition in yourself and others as being ugly. However, if you find yourself feeling irritated or even jealous when other people display signs of being driven, this could be a signal that you haven't yet accepted your own ambitious streak.
Are you choosing what you want to be driven towards?
It's tiring to have ambitions in every arena. Pick what you care about most and focus on that.
Do you compete with others all the time or only when it serves you?
Comparing yourself with others can support you to distinguish your skills and the unique value you can add. But, your biggest competitor should always be yourself .
Have you got enough ambitious people around you?
Befriending and learning from role models and mentors who are smarter and more successful than you will help expand your sense of possibility. Even if you aren't competing with them, their energy will rub off on you. “Talk with and learn from people different from you,” suggests strategy adviser Jason Ma, who refers to what he calls the Power of Proximity. “Be open to dialogue with acquaintances and even select strangers, as you may uncover interesting opportunities.”
Are you willing to take risks?
Ambition takes a willingness to step into fear and anxiety, says psychiatrist Dr. Neel Burton, “ Some people are better able to tolerate this fear, perhaps because they are more courageous, committed, or driven, and can minimize the fear,” he says . “Ambitious people act with purpose, but allow themselves room to explore, experiment and discover.”
Whenever you're next in doubt about whether you're being competitive or ambitious, ask yourself this: ""A m I really trying to do my best or is this about my need to be the best?"" Chances are, you'll be able to tell which state you're in just by how you feel in your body."

lalalexa.com Felicity Carter: What’s your first fashionable memory?
Alexa Mateen: My first fashion memory dates back to when I was about 9, I would make T-shirts. I remember borrowing my mother’s iron and teaching myself how to personalize them with some heat transfer vinyl and a fabric appliqué There were tables full of markers, fabrics, and scissors. I think I still have a few of those shirts!
I can’t tell you how many times I turned a maxi skirt into a dress, a scarf into a headband, jean shorts into a notebook cover (yes, still have that), when I was younger. I always loved fashion, but it was only until recently where it manifested itself into something that would change my life and bring me so much joy.

lalalexa.com FC: Tell us about your background...
AM: My entry into the fashion world really snuck up on me. I’ve always had a passion for fashion, but I have absolutely no training in it. Prior to Lala Léxa, I was a founding member at Tinder, throughout my senior year and a few years after college, focusing on the US expansion of the company. As far as any fashion experience — I had one fashion PR internship when I was 16, and I didn’t like my experience there.
I really do love fashion though. Fashion is one's identity and can be an outlet of full expression. I get dressed in 10 minutes, but I rarely leave the house in an outfit I don’t like... I enjoy experimenting with fashion by mixing and matching different textures and patterns.
About a year ago, my brother bought a house in LA, and there was an estate sale there. I decided to stop by with my older (less fashionably experimental) cousin. I found a bag, or what I thought was as a bag, in the room that I loved and she looked at me like I was crazy for wanting to buy it... she didn’t think it looked like a purse and was rolling her eyes at me for trying to be “different” again. We were invited to an event that night, and I told her “I’m buying it and wearing it out, and if I get 5 compliments or more, I’d make a bag line.”
I got 7! We still joke about it. The vintage find looks nothing like my first design, but that moment was what really pushed me to create designs of my own... And 6 months later, my first bag was sold. To a stranger! Best feeling in the world.

AM: Accessories are what make an outfit unique...shoes, bags, and jewelry can completely change the mood and tone of what you’re wearing. I love bags. And, I have too many of them. But I enjoy wearing them all. I hope to make more accessories, and I’m excited for the journey ahead.
FC: Who is your customer?
AM: My customer is confident and sophisticated, yet fun and playful at the same time. Doesn’t matter if she’s age 21 or age 65...age is just a number after all.

lalalexa.com FC: What role does art play in your brand?
AM: I love to create and wear items that look like art pieces when standing alone. If it doesn’t look good on a bookshelf next to my candles and coffee table books, I don’t want to create it! I don’t have a particular artist or place for inspiration. Inspiration comes from everything and everywhere. I’m a pretty curious person, and I ask questions wherever I go. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve taken a picture of a random household object or an old photo that stood out to me when I was younger...not knowing what to do with it but knowing that I loved it. Today, they inspire a lot of my current designs and what I envision for the future of Lala Léxa. A few days ago I was at a restaurant and loved the color and texture of their menu, so I asked the waitress if I could keep it. It’s on my desk now! We’ll see what comes of that...

lalalexa.com FC: What do you love most about your job?
AM: Two reasons: I love the fact that I get to create things that are an extension of myself and that I can share it with the world. And second, I love seeing a complete stranger carrying my creation. It makes me want to design more. I love doing this on my own, it’s my DNA. I’m born and raised in Los Angeles, Lala is my nickname. My brand is like my baby. I have more energy because of Lala Léxa and I’m not afraid to color outsides the lines, I have nothing to lose!

The Billion-Dollar Indian Premier League Has Americanized Cricket,www.forbes.com,Tristan Lavalette,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tristanlavalette/2019/04/14/the-billion-dollar-indian-premier-league-has-americanized-cricket/,"The Indian Premier League has a huge following. (Photo by Vishal Bhatnagar/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Getty Nonstop action lasting just three hours. A cacophony of pop tunes. Cheerleaders. A blur of color. Film stars in the house. Glitz. Glamour.
It all feels very much like being at a sports game in the U.S, where a continual whirlwind of entertainment is at the core of the fan experience. A gaudy player auction , one of its headlining staples, has a twist on drafts and trades that are intrinsic in U.S. sports.
Welcome, to the Indian Premier League (IPL).
The world’s premier Twenty20 competition stops the cricket-crazy nation for seven weeks annually. Since starting in 2008, the lucrative IPL has turned the staid sport on its head. Being innately British – conjuring stereotypical connotations of spectators picnicking in lush greenery – cricket long pushed back against the type of manufactured entertainment that underpins sports in the U.S.
In a throwback to a bygone era, being at longform matches - which can last a duration of a work week but are often poorly attended – is a tranquil experience. The diehards soak in the action, which Australian comedian Wil Anderson aptly summed up as “on-field chess”.
When the play meanders, spectators will sometimes read a book. Or even doze off. It’s a sporting event where you can socialize – conversations can be had while casually watching. Some indulge in drinking too much alcohol – for a section of fans, that’s their primary reason for attending the cricket.
The sleeker IPL is different. And much louder. Crowds skew younger. It is frenzied entertainment both on-and-off the field. It might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but Twenty20 leagues are seen as instrumental in developing cricket beyond the heartland and the IPL has been mimicked by nearly every major cricket nation.

Even though there have been notable successes, the Big Bash League (BBL) in Australia being a prime example, the IPL remains the gold standard. And its overwhelming success has recalibrated how the sport is followed.
Traditionally, cricket has been most popular at its international level – country vs country - but the IPL created fanatic fandom through domestic franchises much like sports in the U.S. and most other parts of the world.
After initial skepticism, it has been accepted as a genuine sporting league and now become an integral fixture of the cricket calendar. With fans seemingly having genuine loyalties to teams – a major stumbling block in any newly created league – the IPL has undoubtedly been a marketing triumph.
There is unbridled hype over the IPL in India and it has endured much more than a fad which cynics initially thought destined. Even corruption scandals have failed to curb the enthusiasm.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), ever protective of its gold mine, does not fixture any international matches during the IPL – unlike what happens in Australia, for example, where the country’s top stars essentially can’t play in the BBL due to scheduling clashes with the national team.
In another nod to the BCCI’s heft, it does not allow its players to play in other Twenty20 franchise leagues around the world.
Top players are lured by enormous pay packets with a slew of stars earning over $1 million. Virat Kohli, the Indian captain and world’s best batsman, is the highest earner in the current edition with a salary of $2.4 million.

Attendances have been astounding and in 2014 ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues globally.
Star outbid Sony, the previous rights holders with a 10-year contract worth $1 billion, and 12 other bidders to grab the TV and digital rights from 2018-2022.
Even though it had a mammoth television rights deal, the IPL pales in comparison to the NFL, the world's most lucrative league.
Still, IPL chiefs believe it can challenge the global sports giants. But to do that, the IPL needs to summon enthusiasm and interest beyond India. Even in cricket countries, the IPL has struggled to resonate and create much attachment unlike the NBA and English Premier League which transcend borders.
""It can match any league,"" a bullish IPL chairman Rajeev Shukla told AFP. ""In (Indian) cities where we don't host matches, we organize fan parks where we invite people to watch the match on the big screen. So 20,000-30,000 people are coming to the fan parks.
""Now we are planning to take it overseas, to places like Dubai, the U.K. and also America."" There is constant entertainment in the IPL. (Photo By Vishal Bhatnagar/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Getty
Still in its infancy, obviously, there is room for major growth. The IPL only has eight teams, which seems lean for a country with over a billion people. The teams play each other twice before the playoffs and the format is locked in for the duration of the current television rights.
Perhaps some IPL games can be held abroad. In 2009 and 2014, the IPL was held overseas due to national elections, but creating more of a global brand could be harnessed by playing games in key markets.
Maybe, just maybe, one such destination could be the U.S. – a coveted market that has long been mouth-watering for cricket administrators.
Which would be fitting considering the IPL’s innate American characteristics. Tristan Lavalette Contributor I am an accredited cricket journalist in Australia and have covered the sport around the world. Most notably, I reported on the 2017-18 Ashes – cricket’s greatest series... Read More"
The Erstwhile Culture Of Travel,www.forbes.com,Julian Vigo,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianvigo/2019/04/14/the-erstwhile-culture-of-travel/,"As with most every cultural tradition since the rise of the internet and social media, travel culture has vastly changed from how it is conceived, planned and structured today. From the browser to the airport to the vacation spot and since the turn of the millennium, the way we think about travel has been as impacted by new media and technology as much as travel has affected new technology.
For instance, with the rising costs of healthcare in some countries and the limited coverage of public systems in others, people are taking their vacations in parts of the world where they are killing two birds with one stone as medical tourism is not only having a huge spike, but it is actually being advocated by some national health systems . The demand for medical interventions in certain nations like Hong Kong outnumbers the country’s ability to return these professional services. With the increasing popularity of healthcare apps over the past two years that hook into medical tourism, getting rid of your glasses has never been so easy or so cheap.
And it’s no longer westerners traveling to any number of India’s hundreds of specialized eye hospitals which treat everything from diabetic retinopathy to Lasik surgery at a fraction of the price of similar treatments in the west. India’s top clinics like Sankara Eye Foundation and Chaudhary Eye Centre are just two of the nation’s approximately 1,300 eye hospitals which offer both critical and esthetic services, the latter of which heavily serves medical tourists. We are also witnessing the expansion of the Indian model of medical tou rism across the globe as Brazil, Thailand, Malaysia, Costa Rica and, more recently, Iran are just some of the countries offering specialized treatments while also serving as a travel hotspot for vacationers. And just this week, the Yucatan announced plans to expand its footprint into medical and wellness tourism which makes Mexico the number one medical tourist destination in the Americas.
But what about the relaxation part of the vacation?
While traditional travel agencies have shifted their services to what is today called “ transformative travel ” in order to remain viable, these services are somewhat elite and costly. Generally speaking, online travel services are still how most people book their travel. So, when people travel today, their first stop is often to scan flight comparison sites and their next step is usually to seek out accommodation. This can involve anything from booking a hotel or Airbnb rental (which outearned Hilton last year in revenue) and will often take up much time searching its accessibility to certain areas, means of transport, restaurants, and if there is even wifi on the premises. Locating suitable housing can also involve an in-depth search for the best rates with online hotel engines such as Booking.com. Even Google is getting into this market as it has recently announced its expansion of accommodations search . Again, remind me why we aren’t using travel agents?
Travel for pleasure, in the absence of specialist agents, means that our culture of vacation today involves much more planning, research, online comparisons and for many, the hopes of finding keeping to their budget. In essence, there is a lot of stress and planning surrounding travel with little to no time left to read up on destinations and the local activities one will actually do and see when there . This is where travel apps have taken over the “experiential” part of travel.
If in doubt as to what to do, there is now the perfectly commodified solution with Airbnb’s “ Experiences ” which allow you to connect with locals for a tour of Holland’s tulip fields or even to “ play mermaid for a day .” Not only is landing at your destination and hoping for the best and cheapest hostel near the train station a thing of the past, but you can forget about walking through town to just wander and think. Gone are the days of chance and haphazard experiences or, for that matter, of actually speaking to anyone you haven’t previously organized to take a guitar lesson from since today you can organize everything with random strangers who up-sell their wares online. Travel is shifting from directing money to the site of the hotel, museums, river cruises and evening theatre, nowadays vacation travel means diverting this money over to home-owners (who are usually on vacation elsewhere) and local yoga instructors.
Sure, you are still traveling and “vacationing” in a different way, but this new modality of traveling seems to involve an overwhelming demand for interactions, lessons, wellness and “self-discovery” at the end of economic exchange. In the past, the largest chunk of vacation travel was diverted to hotels and meals with little to no pressure to get on the Hop On Hop Off buses. Today vacation travel necessitates another raison d’être for traveling—be it medical, wellness or finding one’s inner truth with apps taking the place of common sense and memory. If you forgot your bathing suit in the past, you would just buy a second one. Today, apps like Packing Pro help the traveler pack and are depressingly more common as we are making replicants of ourselves. Everything about travel today is so tightly regimented and controlled that it is no wonder that people are getting exhausted and anxious from vacations. The expectations are set so high that travel now reminds me of parents planning their children get into an elite university from the day they are born. Why all the pressure?
Just hit travel and fly."
What's The Deal With Women In PropTech?,www.forbes.com,Angelica Krystle Donati,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelicakrystledonati/2019/04/14/whats-the-deal-with-women-in-proptech/,"A couple of months ago, I kicked off the #StartupLife series for this column. In order to gather responses for it, I reached out to my LinkedIn contacts asking all PropTech founders that saw my post to answer a few questions that then fed into the series. When I was compiling the answers for the first article, I noticed something shocking.
Out of nearly 70 respondents to the survey, only 4 were women. I was curious to see if this reflected reality, and went back to the LinkedIn community to ask another question: how many female founders are there in the PropTech and ConTech space?
Can it be true?
Turns out, there are many successful women making waves in the space globally, in areas as diverse as advanced construction robotics, data analytics, investments, smart buildings and more. In future articles, I will run features on some of these women and their game-changing startups, but first I want to address something else. Can it be true that only 10% of PropTech founders are women? And if this is the case, should we be worried?
There is no readily available statistical data on the percentage of female founders in PropTech. I did some digging and found anecdotal information placing the female founder share of the industry somewhere between five and 20%, which makes the number that I got in my accidental survey about right. The share of women in real estate is around 15%, so the figures seem to add up. It is worth noting, however, that the data on real estate encompasses the entire industry, and that in the younger age groups the split is closer to even.
For example, YEP Global , a networking group for young leaders across real estate whose board I sit on, has a 50/50 split in its membership. Perhaps women are just more sociable and feel they need to do more networking to secure their place in the real estate ecosystem, but I also believe the gender gap is slowly starting to close.
Proptech, on the other hand, is predominately made up of people in their twenties and thirties, so why aren't there more women in this category? Most likely because it sits at the intersection of real estate, which ""boasts"" the statistics we discussed above, and tech, a sector that has a notoriously tiny female population.
The darker side
However, there are darker factors at play as well. A couple of months ago, a report by the British Business Bank revealed that female founders get 157 times less funding than men. Behind this alarming headline sits an entire culture.
T his is not just down to there simply being less female-run businesses out there. In fact, the research also showed that start-ups with even one woman on the founding team are less likely to get funding than those run by men. Further, all-female teams are less likely to receive a ""warm"" introduction to a VC (an introduction from someone in their network) and therefore have a lower probability of receiving funding.
It is clear that we have a problem. I've always said that I'm not the biggest fan of affirmative action to solve such issues, as this is likely to foster other kinds of discrimination, and the goal should instead be to eliminate discrimination altogether. Though there may be a variety of reasons for women not to engage with a particular industry, there aren't enough female founders out there (in PropTech or otherwise) because they aren't getting the money they need to launch their businesses.
I reached out to members of the newly minted Women in PropTech group ( WiPT ), which launched in New York in late 2018 and will kick off its London chapter this May, to hear their thoughts on the matter. This is what some of them had to say.
Heather Staff, Director at AgentSoftware told me that she used to work in consultancy prior to moving into PropTech, and felt the lack of diversity more acutely there than in this industry. Staff said, ""I feel PropTech as an industry is more 'embryonic' and so there are fewer preconceived ideas, stereotypes, and expectations of women as a category of people within it, which has been quite refreshing."" Her main gripe is the dearth of female developers, which she believes to be an educational issue: she thinks the problem starts at school and more needs to be done to change the image of what a programmer looks likes and does across the UK.
Claire Owen, Founder at Loop Software, seconds her. Owen, a former estate agent, struggled to find female developers for her PropTech startup. She told me, ""I found this remarkably disheartening as my perception of the tech industry was a much more balanced one, so I do think we have a lot of work to do to remedy this. For a start, young girls should be encouraged to code and to create. It’s an incredibly creative industry which requires logic and imagination, and I think we can do a better job of showing the variety of roles needed within PropTech.""
PropTech consultant Jo Tasker has strong views and is not afraid to share them. She thinks that though the traditional property industry is more consciously sexist than the tech industry, as it is deeply rooted in a male dominant system with 'old school' traditional ways of working.
Though the tech sector may be better, it's not by much, as she told me that, ""I have clearly witnessed similar issues underpinning the sector - evidenced by the gender pay gap, the terrible stats on female founders and investment they receive, the bias-driven recruitment challenges and the low percentage figures of women in sector, and women on boards remaining almost stagnant for the past 20 years at 30%, and more."" Though things have improved in the last decade, we still have a long way to go.
Sammy Pahal, Managing Director of the UK Proptech Association, believes that:
""The reason for the imbalance stems from stereotyping job roles for men and women. Society is starting to encourage more women to have a career in tech but there still needs to be more done to break down stereotypes. Also, most people hear about PropTech only once they have graduated and are starting a career in property. Therefore if the majority of people entering the property industry are men then the majority of people applying for PropTech businesses will be men. We need to promote career opportunities to students or professionals early in the career and highlighting successful women in PropTech to encourage other women to enter the industry or make the move from the property industry. We also raise more awareness of the different types of roles and experience needed within PropTech.""
Weronika Holt, EMEA Client Solutions Director at CBRE, is disappointed that PropTech, despite being a new sector, has inherited the gender bias and inequality that are inherent in real estate and in tech. She would like to see women supporting each other more, telling me that her wish is for women to "" Empower each other. Empower girls, younger women, and fellow professionals to get the right education, get involved, challenge themselves, be confident, know their self-worth and get up when they fail and try again.""
It is not all doom and gloom, however. Lucy Sharp, co-Founder at Dot Residential, has had very positive experiences in her career so far. Prior to PropTech, she worked in FinTech PR and never felt any bias against her even when she decided to start a family.
Sharp told me that:
“Being a woman in Proptech is 100% something my co-founders and team have seen as a huge positive. There has been no stigma. Over lunch with the FT last week, the journalist looked me for answers as much my (male) co-founder. I’m excited to get in front of investors in the coming months now I’m back from maternity leave – I see my gender as a huge asset. Ultimately people buy into a person, not your sex. I won’t hear otherwise.”
It is clear that any industry with a strong gender imbalance is missing out on the huge potential that the category it is not tapping into can bring. Real estate and PropTech have a dearth of women, especially of female founders, and a long road ahead towards an even playing field. This undoubtedly needs to start in schools, as several of the women we heard from today pointed out. But, also, let's not forget the huge funding gap that female founders have to face. They need more money, above everything else!"
Mercedes-Benz Delivers Masters VIP Experience As One Of Three Global Partners,www.forbes.com,Erik Matuszewski,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikmatuszewski/2019/04/14/mercedes-benz-delivers-masters-vip-experience-as-one-of-three-global-partners/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin There are many ways to take in the Masters Tournament. Global partners like Mercedes use the season's first major championship as a way to share special access and experiences with its customers and business sponsors. Erik Matuszewski For years, I covered the Masters Tournament by spending the majority of my time in the media center, skipping out a few times a day for idyllic walks around Augusta National Golf Club.
It was always my favorite sporting event to cover: soaking in the history and traditions of a phenomenal venue and tournament, experiencing the passion (from players and patrons) that the first major championship of the year elicits, and seeing how an entire town and community is galvanized by a single week. I relished the way Augusta National was constantly evolving, improving and looking to the future, yet at the same time was a throwback to simpler times – it’s no-phone policy and lack of on-course corporate branding are virtually unheard of in modern sports.
At Augusta National – and in all of Augusta, Georgia, really -- the Masters is the brand. One estimate put the branding value of the omnipresent Masters logo (on course signage, hole pin flags, caddy hats and bibs, television graphics, and so on) at $83 million last year. Seeing the way that brand-building results in non-stop merchandise sales and feverish ticket demand, and there’s no reason to think Augusta National would want to dilute that with a corporate presence on the course.
That’s not to say that the Masters doesn’t have corporate partnerships. It does, but they’re limited. The tournament’s three global sponsors are Mercedes-Benz, AT&T and IBM. And while they may not have visible branding on the course, they’re featured prominently on the broadcast and take full advantage in other ways – including sharing special access and experiences with their business partners and top customers.
For many sports fans or golf fans, a trip to the Masters is a dream come true – an in-person opportunity to hear the legendary roars, traipse the elevation changes, or spend a few hours in Amen Corner. It always was for me. And this year I got to experience it in a completely new way, as a special guest of Mercedes-Benz.
There are a lot of different ways to do the Masters. All are highly recommended. But for me, this year’s visit might be as good as it gets. Like the fleet of Mercedes courtesy cars proffered to players in the field, I was loaned one of the automaker’s newest luxury vehicles for the week. I drove the sporty AMG E-Class Coupe from Atlanta to Augusta, where Mercedes rented out more than 30 well-appointed homes in a neighborhood about 20 minutes from the club. Mercedes vehicles lined up outside the clubhouse of the community reserved for the company's VIPs. Erik Matuszewski
Homeowners leave town for the week, turning the neighborhood into a pseudo-community for VIP guests, who have been flown in by Mercedes-Benz from all over the country. The new Mercedes sits in the driveway as we take golf carts back and forth from the house to the main clubhouse, where private events are held each night and we indulge in all the complimentary food and drink we could possibly desire.
One night, as guests enjoyed dessert, Rickie Fowler – a global brand ambassador -- stopped by to talk about his expectations and favorite traditions at the Masters, no longer being single, life on the PGA TOUR and the experience at Augusta National. “There’s nowhere that really compares,” Fowler said during an informal and entertaining Q&A with ESPN personality Scott Van Pelt. Afterward, Fowler took photos with every guest in attendance. Rickie Fowler stopped in after dinner one night to chat with Mercedes-Benz VIPs. Mercedes-Benz USA
There was an intimate feel to the event and there was more to come. Jon Rahm, another Mercedes ambassador, stopped by another night, while country singer Kane Brown performed a private concert in which he shared stories and songs after dinner following Thursday night’s opening round.
At the course, the set-up is even more impressive. VIPs are shuttled to the course – in Mercedes Sprinter vans, of course – driving through the main entrance and down Magnolia Lane, then winding through the club’s grounds before stopping at Firethorn Cabin. One day, we cruised past the practice area and the par-3 course, while another we weaved through a huge bamboo grove and past a compound for TV trucks. It was a fascinating behind-the-scenes look that most patrons don’t get to experience. Most also won’t get the kind of pampering that’s present at Firethorn, which is one of the VIP cabins tucked out of sight behind towering magnolia trees off the 10 th fairway. The three private cabins alongside the 10th fairway at Augusta National. Erik Matuszewski
Private chefs prepare meals for guests, from classic Southern fare to an afternoon spread that includes a bounty of stone crab claws, lobster, shrimp and crab legs. There’s an inside dining area with a fully-stocked bar at one end of the main room, where soft couches and chairs offer a respite, while multiple big screen TVs allow for viewing the action while off the course. An outside deck, elevated from a lower patio with a grill, offers additional eating space and more couches on which to watch golf in a tranquil, private setting while fans slowly spin overhead. There's something special about watching a great shot on the TV overhead -- a tee shot close to the pin on the par-3 12th hole, for example -- and simultaneously hearing the crowd reaction from Amen Corner a short distance away.
Despite the abundance of food and drink, guests can also get the on-course staples. Simply ask and a staff will bring you one of the famous pimento cheese sandwiches or the scrumptious Georgia Peach ice cream sandwiches – the kind of grub that’s unique to the Masters. The Georgia Peach ice cream sandwich is sold only at the Masters Tournament. Erik Matuszewski
After walking much of the course one morning, including following Tiger Woods and his group on the first nine, I came back to Firethorn Cabin for lunch, then grabbed an ice cream sandwich and headed out for a little more action. This time, I went out the front door and to the private putting green for the VIP cabins – a lightning-fast green that’s built to the same specifications as the one found on Augusta National’s 18 th hole.
Club professionals from around the country are stationed at the green (I talked with guys from Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina and Georgia), and lead guests through a putting course laid out differently each day. At least one of the putts included a gentle touch from the upper tier to the lower, or a tough uphill run from the lower to the upper. There is also a regular-size Augusta National flag in a hole cut about one step from the edge of the green, near a slope as well as the fall line between the two tiers.
One of the pros mentioned to me that they had an alternate-shot contest among themselves where they putted from the far side of the green – top shelf – to this particular pin about 30 feet away. He smiled and queried: “Guess what the best score was?” I saw the slope and where the hole was located. It seemed like an easy three-putt. Since he was asking, I went higher. “Five?” I asked. “Nope,” he responded. “13. One guy made a 35-footer for 13.” The private putting green outside Firethorn Cabin is modeled after the 18th hole at Augusta National. The tall flag on the far side of the green is in one of the most challenging spots on the green, as a ball won't stop anywhere near the hole. Erik Matuszewski
Naturally, I tried my hand at this unofficial putt. It had a good line, starting bending about six feet, approached the flag (and the pitched slope at the edge of the green) and then banked hard to the right, breaking about a foot in the final two feet. It picked up speed as it slung along the slope and carried down the hill to the lower tier, stopping about 40 feet away. My next putt up the hill was pushed to the left by the hill, curled around and came back down the slope to my feet. The results repeated themselves, sometimes running out a little further depending on how hard you hit it up the slope. I finally knocked one of the uphill putts in – pinning it against the flagstick – to score a satisfying 11.
I’d get out on the main course each day, of course, but also made sure to get out multiple times on a putting green that’s as close to the true Augusta National experience as most golfers will get to experience.
I started my VIP week at the Masters with a true player experience – with the courtesy car from Mercedes-Benz – and finished it with a similar experience on the green.
While you really won’t see anything from the Masters’ corporate partners on the course at Augusta National, they’re taking full advantage, both off and on. It’s an extravagance that’s out of reach for most, but should you ever get the invitation or opportunity, it’s not to be missed. While there are a lot of ways to enjoy the Masters, there aren’t much better than this.

That’s been the Green Bay Packers’ calling card when it comes to the first round of the NFL Draft.
The Packers have selected a defensive player with their first pick for seven straight years. Unfortunately for Green Bay, it still ranked just 22 nd in points allowed (25.0) and 18 th in total defense (354.4) last season.
The Packers have two first round picks and 10 selections overall in this year’s draft, and could once again invest heavily in their defense early on.
We recently outlined five defensive players that make sense for the Packers at No. 12. Here are five more defensive players Green Bay could select at No. 30.
Byron Murphy, CB, Washington
Despite using their first pick on a cornerback two straight years and three of the last four, the Packers still have issues at the position.
Murphy (5-11, 190) surprised many by coming out after his redshirt sophomore year. But Murphy is a gritty, ball-hawking corner who had 20 pass breakups and seven interceptions in 87 career targets.
Murphy’s size will scare some teams away. Others will be concerned that he played in just 20 career games at Washington. But his instincts and quickness are impressive and likely to land him a spot in the later part of Round 1.
“Good little player,” one scout told Bobmcginnfootball.com. “He’s just little, though. I don’t know why he came out. That shocked me. He can cover and he’s quick. This guy can run. His hips, feet and change of direction … bam, bam, bam.”
Jerry Tillery, DL, Notre Dame
Tillery (6-6, 295) has first round talent, but lacked consistency with the Fighting Irish. Tillery is long, muscular and extremely powerful, ideally suited for defensive end in a 3-4 scheme.
Tillery was suspended for breaking team rules as a freshman and stepped on players from USC during a loss to the Trojans his sophomore season. He also underwent surgery in March for a torn labrum and will be likely sidelined until training camp.
But if a team can get past the red flags, Tillery’s upside is certainly appealing.
“I think I’m quick off the ball,” Tillery said. “I have great technique and when I approach the linemen, I have a big arsenal of tools that I use to my advantage and I am successful with. Also the work that I put in. I work so hard at perfecting these different techniques and perfecting them. That’s what I do for a living.”
Nasir Adderley, S, Delaware
Cousin of Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Herb Adderley, who was a star for Green Bay in the 1960s. Green Bay’s most glaring weakness might be safety, and Adderley would give them someone to pair with recent free agent pick-up Adrian Amos.
Adderley has good size (6-0, 206) and enough athleticism where some teams are discussing moving him to corner. Adderley suffered a hamstring injury at his pro day workout, but that shouldn't prevent him from being perhaps the first small school player drafted.
“I feel like my performance at the Senior Bowl alleviated some of the questions,” Adderley said of playing at a small school. “So, more so, we're focusing on just going forward and I am confident in my ability. The small school thing, that's never been an issue for me at all. And then I'm realizing a lot of these teams are seeing that as well.”
DeAndre Baker, CB, Georgia
Baker, the top senior corner in the draft, is an extremely competitive, pesky press corner. In the last two seasons, Baker had five interceptions and didn’t allow a touchdown while playing in the ultra-competitive SEC.
Baker’s size (5-11, 193) and speed (4.52) aren’t great. But Baker plays bigger than he is and has been a terrific tackler.
“I want to face the best receiver every week end,” Baker said. “When I get up that’s the first thing on my mind, facing the best receiver. I want to show my talent. He wants to show his talent. It’s man on man, that’s what I like to do.”
Taylor Rapp, S, Washington
Rapp (6-0, 208), a three-year starter at Washington, has a high football IQ and projects to a combo-type safety.
Rapp doles out plenty of punishment and his run support is better than his coverage skills. If the Packers liked Rapp, they could likely trade back from No. 30 and get him in the second round.
“I think I can do everything on the back end,” Rapp said. “I think my biggest asset is my versatility, and I think I can do everything. I can cover a deep third, I can cover a deep half, I can roll down to the box, I can go the alley and tackle. I can blitz, I can cover receivers, I can cover the slot, I can cover a tight end. I think I'm the complete package.”"
How A Day Trader Turned Non-Profit Founder Changed The World With A Dream,www.forbes.com,John Schneider and David Auten,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/debtfreeguys/2019/04/14/how-a-day-trader-turned-non-profit-founder-changed-the-world-with-a-dream/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Personal Finance Cashing in on fabulous with queer money. Tweet This Share to twitter Share to linkedin Steve Bolinger was a day trader in Denver, Colorado and saw his future taking him to New York City, making lots of money in finance. But in contrast to the infamous fictional character, Gordon Gekko, life took Bolinger in a different direction. Steve Bolinger of Development in Gardening Stefan Hauswald
An inspiring trek through Australia, Asia and Europe gave Bolinger a different purpose on the other side of the world. His success in helping others has created small businesses for those who need it most. On this episode of Queer Money ® , Bolinger shares his inspiration and experience to go from a day trader to the founder of a successful non-profit.
Hear how a day trader turned non-profit founder changed the world:
How to lose a job and become happier
Bolinger grew up in Kansas and after college he started working for a private investor as a day trader in Wichita, trading in and out of thousand-block shares within seconds and minutes. The investor, for whom Bolinger was trading, opened franchises in a couple of states where investors could trade their own money.
Bolinger was transferred to Denver to help open an office there. It was in Denver where he found a sense of community and could be out and open as a gay man. Moving from conservative Kansas to more liberal Denver, Bolinger found his people, found his scene and could be his true self. He says, “ ”
Eventually, his investor closed shop and, what might’ve seemed like the end of the world, opened up a world of opportunities for Bolinger.
Soon after losing his job, Bolinger spent nine months traveling the world, experiencing other worlds and gaining perspective on what his world was all about. He started in Australia, went to the Philippines, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, India and finally a couple stops in Europe.
Bolinger’s time in Cambodia had a profound effect on him. He tells the story of his motorbike driver. The two became friends, and one day Bolinger bought his new friend a coat. It was the first new item the Cambodian man ever owned.
His new friend was so happy, he wore the coat every day and slept in it at night. Seeing the pure joy this man exuded transformed Bolinger. It was then that he started to realize that he couldn’t return to corporate America. He felt drawn to help people in a different way.
How to change careers
Upon returning from his trip abroad, Bolinger researched international development jobs for hire. He ran into challenges when he learned that most international development jobs require two years of experience living abroad inclusive of knowing the local language.
But Bolinger didn’t want to waste time and assume debt by returning to school. So, he joined the Peace Corps, as he learned it was the easiest route in pursuit of his new goal.
Due to his experience with agricultural and ability to speak French, the Peace Corps sent Bolinger to Senegal. He was appointed as an urban agriculture specialist whose job it was to help the local women build sustainable, urban gardens.
One day, Bolinger’s boss asked him to do a project for the HIV/AIDS hospital. Many hospitals in these urban regions weren’t equipped to provide food for their patients. Thus, patients had to rely on family to feed them, and sadly many were ignored and left starving because of the stigma with HIV/AIDS. Thus, the Peace Corps, through Bolinger’s efforts, provided food to the hospital’s kitchens to then feed their patients.
The garden was successful, and its success inspired Bolinger. Although he loved the fast-paced life of trading, Bolinger knew there was more to life than earning money and living the “fabulous gay life” he previously wanted.
Bolinger says, “I felt if I left the Peace Corps, returned to the U.S. and got a job, I’d be doing humanity a disservice because I had this gift, an idea in my head, and I could give it to people .” Upon making this decision, Bolinger continues, “ ”
He searched for organizations solely dedicated to creating sustainable gardens for local communities. After much digging, Bolinger couldn’t find a single organization solely doing this kind of work. Of the organizations he found, most taught and supported gardening education in tandem with nutrition education, HIV/AIDS counseling and support and childcare services.
Bolinger knew this wouldn’t be his whole life, but he knew it was what he wanted next. So, he started recruiting other Peace Corps volunteers to support his new efforts. During his remaining time in Senegal, Bolinger connected with other organizations for sponsorships, and for his organization, Development in Gardening (DIG), to complement other existing services.
Upon returning to the U.S., Bolinger completed the paperwork for his 501(c)3 and found seed money mostly through friends, family and former colleagues to kickstart his non-profit. Of the queer community, Bolinger says, “If it wasn’t for the ‘gay community,’ DIG wouldn’t exist.”
Upon DIG’s return to Africa with $40,000 of seed money, the work just came his way. Hospitals and good Samaritans alike wanted to replicate Bolinger’s initial success. He adds, “It just seemed like the universe was working in our favor.”
Bolinger attributes much of DIG’s success to its workers being embedded in the communities, and not necessarily working in the capital cities directing the non-profits miles away from the communities it serves.
Because, for Bolinger, DIG has always been about serving people.
If you build it, they will come
“Most people want to be a part of something larger than themselves, and we’re giving them that chance,” says Bolinger. DIG’s in over ten countries and in its 13th year. “It now has a life of its own, and I couldn’t stop it if I wanted because of so many supportive people and how many thousands of people it’s affecting.”
Now grandmothers in countries across Africa are teaching their children how to grow sustainable gardens. Children are learning sustainable gardening in school and teaching their parents. For non-profits that teach HIV education, for example, it can take years to prove the education paid off. “With DIG, you know people ‘get it’ when they show you a tomato or they show you a basket of green beans they’re taking to the market to sell,” Bolinger says.
Not only does Bolinger’s dream teach communities sustainable, organic farming, it now teaches them how to turn their efforts into small businesses. The lives of HIV patients who were once shunned from their communities are forever changed. Because of their abilities to both feed and financially support their families with their work, they’re now leaders in their families and business leaders in their communities.
Bolinger gives much credit to those who followed him at DIG for making it what it is today. But it can’t be ignored that the dream of this one-time day trader is giving developing communities nutrition, education and opportunity to thrive physically and financially.

Hands-On With The Garmin MARQ Athlete,www.forbes.com,Anthony Karcz,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykarcz/2019/04/14/hands-on-with-the-garmin-marq-athlete/,"A good indicator of whether or not a watch like the Garmin MARQ Athlete is an effective daily driver is if you miss it when you're wearing something else. After a week wearing the MARQ Athlete and switching back to my Apple Watch Series 4, I can say that I undoubtedly do, but maybe not for the reasons you'd think.
What is It?
The Athlete is the highest-end fitness watch Garmin has ever produced. Part of the MARQ line, it's meant to be the pinnacle of everything Garmin has done in the GPS-guided, fitness-focused, activity-tracking market. It's their most advanced fitness watch ever, with every sensor and smart trick they have packed in to a stylish titanium casing.
It's also an eye-wateringly steep $1,500. Over $400 more than Garmin's previous top end watch, the fenix 5 Plus.
What Can It Do?
What can't it do? The MARQ Athlete is at its core, a fitness watch. It can track and map your runs, rows, cardio classes, weightlifting sessions, bike rides, swims, golf games, hikes, yoga sessions, triathalons...if you can do it and you want to track it, the MARQ has a setting for it.
Beyond simply tracking, the MARQ also keeps an eye on training effectiveness with a Pulse Ox sensor. Using that, it can tell if your extra Saturday run is doing you any good, or if you're just beating yourself up. Dedicated markers on the default virtual watch face let you see at a glance what your VO2 Max score is (higher numbers mean your body is more effective at oxygenating your system) and how long you should wait to recover before your next workout.
It's also a smartwatch with notifications (though you can't really interact with them), support for music services like Spotify, on-board music storage, Bluetooth connectivity, NFC payments with Garmin Pay (ala Apple Pay), its own app store, and more.
With around a week to 10 days of battery life with mixed activity, you don't need to pop it on the charger every night, making it a very effective sleep tracker as well.
First Impressions
A watch this pretty doesn't need a flashy container.
Anthony Karcz Pick it up and you'll know, this is no plasticky track timer. The titanium case is solid, yet light. The buttons satisfyingly tactile. At 46mm, it's just a hair smaller than the mid-sized fenix 5 Plus but it has a much more substantial presence on your wrist. This isn't some bland square or understated matt black run watch, this is a watch that's meant to be seen. The silicone rubber watch band complements the case well, but may not be for everyone (it utilizes quick release latches so that you can switch it out easily). The domed sapphire crystal face resists scratches and is wonderfully clear. But then there's that screen...
Always know exactly how hard you can go with a glance.
Garmin Take a look at this press shot, with its crisp, clear, gorgeous screen. It only exists to break your heart. Since the screen of the MARQ Athlete is based on Garmin's existing device tech, instead of a bright, crystal clear interface available whenever you glance at your wrist, most of the time when you glance down, you're going to see this:
Lights on, lights off, lights on again.
Anthony Karcz Turning on the backlight does improve things a bit, but if you're used to the clarity of the Apple Watch, there's no doubt that it's a compromise.
Hit the Road
All that is forgotten when you step into the bright sunlight, pop in some earbuds, load up some tunes and head out for a run.
The MARQ Athlete performs its function as a fitness tracker with aplomb. The screen is easy to use, even in full sun, while wearing polarized sunglasses. The multiple GPS and satellite sensors ensure that not only is your run tracked properly, it's pinpoint accurate.
More data than you need.
Anthony Karcz After the run you can pore over an obscene amount of data. Heart rate, cadence, training effect, elevation and more are available on the best-in-class Garmin Connect app.
Indoors, the treadmill and rowing machine activity trackers are good enough to keep you honest (though not nearly as accurate as the outdoor activity trackers). The free weight exercise tracker is hit-or-miss and highly dependent on what kind of exercises you're doing. I'd love to see a generic HIIT tracker like the Apple Watch has for when you're doing a routine that transitions between cardio machines, body weight exercises, and weights. It's way too easy to miss a transition to a different activity and end up tracking the wrong thing.
Does It Beat the Apple Watch?
It doesn't. But then that's because it doesn't need to.
When it comes to smart notifications, what you get from the MARQ Athlete is the same as you get from every other Garmin smart device, which is a dismissable pop-up. There's zero interaction. There's no ""Hey Siri."" There's no quick response to texts. Opening and navigating apps like Spotify is frustratingly slow compared to the Apple Watch Series 4.
But if you're buying the MARQ Athlete looking for a smartwatch, you're buying it for the wrong reason.
The MARQ Athlete is a fitness tool with extra smartwatch features, not the other way around. The data that I get on a daily basis from the Athlete is useful, satisfying, and comprehensive in a way that Apple can't give me.
Garmin's Secret Weapon
A lot of fitness wearables collect health data - steps, activity, heart rate, pulse ox. But what they do with it is either present it all to you and let you sort it out, or hide it behind simplified interfaces.
When connected to the MARQ Athlete, Garmin Connect is like having a dashboard readout for my health and fitness. More than just serving up raw metrics (which are still easily accessible), it takes those data points and analyzes them, extrapolating things like overall fitness, future race performance, and more.
Wondering if you got a good night's sleep? It's more important than you think.
Anthony Karcz I mentioned sleep earlier and I continue to be impressed with how Garmin considers sleep to be a vital component of your ability to perform, not be some throwaway statistic. How well you sleep, how hard you train, your stress levels, your blood oxygen levels, all are reflected in your Body Battery score. As that changes, you'll see helpful tips on how to plan your day.
Feeling good? Feeling bad? Check your battery levels.
Anthony Karcz Is It Worth It?
While it's never bothered me before, at the $1,500 price point, I have to wonder if a battery-powered, 240-pixel screen is offering the best return on investment. Garmin watches are expensive, but highly effective, tools for pro (and pro-aspiring) athletes. But the MARQ line is squarely aimed at those who consider watches to be heirloom-quality items.
Personally, I've never gotten more than four years out of a Garmin with regular use before the battery reached a point where it was no longer effective. That's annoying when it's a $300 Forerunner. It's pearl-clutchingly shocking for a watch in this price range.
Yes. The MARQ Athlete is going to look better than everyone else's watch at the starting line, but your grandkids won't be singing its praises.
Should I Buy It Anyway?
Like I said at the beginning, what's telling about a piece of tech for me isn't necessarily what I think of it while I'm using it, but if I'm thinking about it when I'm not. The MARQ Athlete hits that sweet spot.
As I do things throughout the day, I wonder about how they're affecting my numbers in the Garmin Connect app. Instead of generic rings that are tracking, who knows what (if I had $1 for every time Apple's Stand ring congratulated me for closing it while I was sitting down…), I feel like I can make an actionable difference.
When I wake up, I feel better prepared to make smart choices about my training. I have a better sense of how hard I can go on my runs, if I need to ease off the gas a bit, or, more likely, if I need to work a little harder to ensure that I'm reaching my goals. The MARQ Athlete will keep you honest, offering up projected race finish times for various distances. It's a nice motivator.
Wearing the Garmin MARQ Athlete is a bit like having a personal coach with you all the time, analyzing how your actions throughout the day make you a better runner, biker, swimmer, pogo jumper...whatever you are.
Garmin wanted to produce a special watch for their 30th anniversary, and they've done it with the MARQ Athlete. It is, simply, the most advanced fitness device they've ever created, in the most attractive form they've ever made. If you're looking for a run watch that looks and feels like a high-end timepiece, and you're looking to be the best athlete you can be, your search is over.
The MARQ Athlete (and all the other watches in the MARQ line) can be found on the Garmin website .
Thanks to Garmin for providing a device for review. Opinions are my own."

There's A Titanfall Reference In The 'Jedi: Fallen Order' Trailer You Might Have Missed,www.forbes.com,Dave Thier,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2019/04/14/wall-running-theres-a-titanfall-reference-in-the-jedi-fallen-order-trailer-you-might-have-missed/,"There's pressure on Jedi: Fallen Order . Respawn Entertainment's new game is now carrying the entire single-player load of the Star Wars video game universe after a few high-profile cancellations, and fans are beginning to get their hopes up. There's a reason to: the trailer we saw today showed off a compelling concept for a new story within a familiar universe, and it's been a little while since we've had a true Jedi fantasy. For many gamers, however, a lot of those hopes hinge on the developer handling it. Respawn Entertainment is a critical darling, and you can see a bit of its previous work in the new trailer. Protagonist Cal Kestis is doing all sorts of Jedi stuff in the 2 minute cinematic we've seen: swinging that lightsaber around, moving stuff with the force, all that good stuff. At one point, however, he pulls off a particularly impressive-looking navigation maneuver that lets him cross a gap by running across a wall. You can see it at around 1:15 in the trailer below:
Now, this isn't the first time Jedi have used a little wall running: it's a popular video game navigation technique, and we've seen it in other Jedi-themed games. And yet when you see it in the trailer above, pulled off in that particular way and coming from this particular developer, there's really no mistaking its pedigree in this situation.
Wall running is sort of the signature pilot move in the Titanfall games, and comes to symbolize the hypermobility that defines non-Titan combat. It was used to good effect in Titanfall , but it was in Titanfall 2 that it came to define the rollercoaster-style constant movement of both the campaign and multiplayer to incredible effect. We've seen it make its way into other games since, but when Titanfall came out it was a giant shift from the relatively on-the-ground combat we were seeing at the time.
It makes me more excited for the game, assuming that putting this in there was intentional and that we'll see it in the main game. It tells me that we're going to see more of the movement that Respawn did so well in the Titanfall games and that feels totally essential to a Jedi fantasy. Making a character move like a Jedi without totally losing control will be a tough challenge, but I feel like Respawn is up to it."
Who Will Die In The 'Game Of Thrones' Season 8 Premiere? You Can Win Prizes From Your Predictions,www.forbes.com,Dave Thier,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2019/04/14/pool-who-will-die-in-the-game-of-thrones-season-8-premiere-you-can-win-prizes-from-your-predictions/,"It's been a long, bloody eight years. We are now only hours away from the Game of Thrones Season 8 premiere, as we begin to put a cap on a story so impossibly sprawling it seems absurd to imagine that it could ever end. You know the rules: there are no rules. Game of Thrones is the show where anyone can die at any moment, whether they're at the height of their triumph or the depth of their despair. It's part of what makes the show fun, but also incredibly stressful. If you're looking to lower the tension a bit, you can always try betting on it. The idea of a Game of Thrones death pool has become a thing since someone posted about the one they were having at work on Reddi t, and retailer GameStop is getting in on the action as well. Every week, it's going to be hosting ""pool"", or, at least, a pool-style competition, where it's asking people to predict who's going to die in each episode, as well as who is going to sit on the Iron Throne when the whole thing is said and done. It will also be selecting some random winners to receive some Game of Thrones merchandise.
 You'll be able to make your predictions here at this link once it goes live at 8:00 AM Central Time, and you'll have until 30 minutes before the episode airs to get your guesses in.
The death pool operates on a similar principle as a March Madness pool: you can make educated guesses on what's going to happen, but there's always going to be a wild card that throws everything for a loop.
Guesses for this week are broad, but I'd guess that Tormund Giantsbane or Beric Dondarrion would be likely targets, both of them in danger from the Night King's army and both of them sitting in a nice little sweet spot as far as characters on this show go: we're attached enough that we'd be sad to see them go, but they're not necessarily integral to the plot.
A friend of mine also thinks that while Theon might be up for a redemption arc, he'd also be a pretty good target just for not having a whole lot else to do right now. His sister, Yara, is on the chopping block for pretty similar reasons: she's both in peril and if we're being honest, disposable.
It's unlikely, but not impossible, that we'll lose a major character in the premiere: names that end in Lannister or Stark probably won't go down until a little later. Still, you never know. We'll see tonight."
Debunking A Dangerous Myth About Tornado Sirens - They Shouldn't Warn You Inside,www.forbes.com,Marshall Shepherd,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2019/04/14/debunking-a-dangerous-myth-about-tornado-sirens-they-shouldnt-warn-you-inside/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin Over the past 36 hours or so, I have watched tornadic storms ravaged parts of the southern United States. The Storm Prediction Center of the National Weather Service has been warning for days that a potent storm system would produce this type of activity. Even as I write this essay, parts of Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas should keep a weather eye out this Palm Sunday. As I write this, my area of Georgia is under a tornado watch until 2 pm. Unfortunately, Palm Sunday has seen its share of tornado outbreaks over the years, and some churches even decided to cancel services today. I had no intentions of writing anything today until I saw the following Tweet:
No tornado siren could be heard in highland lakes! Large oak and pine trees on houses. Could have been very bad with children’s bedrooms mostly upstairs. Thanks for the heads up @spann Any idea why they didn’t go off?
The person tweeting this had nothing but the best intentions so there is no intent to ridicule him. In fact, the Tweet is useful because it provides an opportunity to remind the public facing tornado danger why you cannot rely on tornado sirens indoors. Meteorologists tracking severe storms. NOAA
My good friend and colleague James Spann is one of the best broadcast meteorologists in the business. He is certified by the American Meteorological Society and hosts the outstanding WeatherBrains podcast. Spann is the Chief Meteorologist at WBMA ABC 33/40 in Birmingham , which had tornado risks all night. His response to that tweet sums it up: ""This is why we say NEVER rely on a siren! Every Alabama home must have a NOAA Weather Radio…""
In fact, the NOAA, the parent agency of the National Weather Service has clear guidance on outdoor warning sirens on its website. However, before I mention those, it is important to note that they are called ""outdoor"" warning sirens. Here is what the NOAA says on its Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ website about what it means when you hear an outdoor warning siren:
In short, it means that something life-threatening is happening and you should go indoors and get more information. The specific guidelines (tornado, hail ,wind, etc.) for sounding sirens varies by jurisdiction, so check with your local community to find out the specifics if you are interested.... Sirens are an outdoor warning system designed only to alert those who are outside that something dangerous is approaching.
For alerts indoors at home or in the workplace, the website recommends a NOAA Weather Radio All-Hazards. As the website points out, ""NOAA Weather Radio is like a smoke detector for severe weather, and it can wake you up when a warning is issued for your area so you can take appropriate action."" In the more modern era, I would also recommend certain alert Apps like Red Cross Tornado or the FEMA App . Here in Georgia, I rely on the ReadyGA App. Even with Apps, you must remember that a fully-charged phone is a requirement. Anna Lawrence is a teacher in Georgia and our daughters are in the same Girl Scout troop. She messaged me this morning and said, ""Weather radio already went off this morning and my county alert system called, will stay informed and aware!"" Her county has sirens, but Mrs. Lawrence clearly has the right approach to risk messaging for our ongoing tornado watch.
Spann's response to the aforementioned Tweet is not a flash in the pan moment. He has been a strong advocate on educating the public about tornado safety and sirens. He wrote the following in a 2016 blog:
THE SIREN MENTALITY: Why in the world do people think they will hear a magical air raid siren inside their home to let them know a tornado is coming? Sure, you might hear a siren on nice days with blue sky and sunshine when they are being tested, but you have no hope in the middle of the night during a severe thunderstorm. They have never been designed to warn people inside homes, businesses, schools, churches, or any other structure. They reach a limited number of people outside, and that is it.
I often write Forbe s articles to increase science literacy, and this one is no different. However, I also hope it serves a greater purpose for someone out there. Stay safe. Meteorologist James Spann speaking about tornado safety. James Spann/Medium Blog

Your mileage may vary, but the bottom line is that the sites are either inaccessible or broken.
A live heatmap of reported Facebook outages
DownDetector As you'd expect, Facebook-owned services like Instagram and Whatsapp are affected, with reports pouring in quickly from around the world. Not every user is affected, but the live heatmap is only getting hotter as the west coast wakes up this morning.
At time of publication, Facebook has not addressed the issue on Twitter, which it ironically relies upon to reach out to its users when the social media network experiences problems -- like it did just last month . One has to chuckle when seeing Facebook's Twitter banner, proclaiming it's ""Bringing the world closer together.""
The last Facebook network outage was a windfall for rival messaging service Telegram, which boasted it had attracted 3 million new users in less than 24 hours.
I've reached out to Facebook for a comment, and will keep tabs on this unexplained social media outage. Updates will be posted below."

McVegan In The USA? Celebrity-Backed Petition Calls For Exactly That,www.forbes.com,Michael Pellman Rowland,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelpellmanrowland/2019/04/14/mcvegan-celebrity-petition/,"Burger King’s recent announcement of an Impossible Burger roll-out has reignited calls for McDonald’s to add a meatless patty to its menu. A Change.org petition asking the fast food icon to add a meatless option has garnered over 160,000 signatures, including an endorsement from Ellen DeGeneres . Petition starter Kathy Freston , a New York Times best selling author and healthy living advocate, started the campaign for McDonald’s to introduce a meatless alternative over five years ago. After her initial meeting with McDonald's and their top chef, the conversation lost steam as McDonald's appeared disinterested.
""Plant-based and animal-based burgers have become nearly indistinguishable in taste. The consumer wants options, and so far, McDonald’s has not heard us. As the battle for the best meatless burger ramps up, McDonald's is being left behind by its biggest rival. A full third of us identify as flexitarians – people who are moving away from too much meat – so why not have something for everyone? It’s time to move away from old-school food and into a cleaner future!"" - Kathy Freston
McDonald's veggie burger, which they rolled out with much success in Finland
McDonald's I mean, it's not like McDonald's hasn't ventured into the plant-based space before. McDonald's introduced the Le Grand Veggie burger in France. A first of its kind for McDonald’s in France, it features a patty made with carrots and root vegetables. McDonald’s seems to be aware of the growing trend in France to eat less meat and didn’t want to miss the boat.
In fact, McDonald’s has unveiled a number of meatless burgers, including the McVeggie in locations across Norway. In 2017 it released the McVegan in Finland . At the time many called it the ‘best vegetarian burger’ they’ve ever had. The McVegan burger is now part of the permanent menu in outlets across Finland and Sweden after selling 150,000 vegan burgers in the first month.
As recently as two weeks ago, McDonald's even hinted at launching a vegetarian burger this year in Australia.
For McDonald's competitors, they must be quite happy that the fast-food behemoth is taking its sweet time in the US.
White Castle and Impossible Foods just celebrated the one-year anniversary of their partnership to bring the Impossible Slider to its customers. Initially it was added to 140 White Castle menus in New York, New Jersey and Chicago. After exceeding projections and inciting a social media frenzy, the Impossible Slider was rolled out to all restaurants in September 2018.
White Castle and Impossible Foods then teamed up with one of the most influential hip-hop groups of all time, the Wu-Tang Clan, to produce a four-part web series entitled, “Wu Tang in Space Eating Impossible Sliders.” The series, available on Impossible Foods’ website, features RZA, GZA and Ghostface Killah enjoying Impossible Sliders while answering fan-generated questions. The series was recently selected as a finalist for the Tribeca Film Festival’s Tribeca X Award, and will be screened along with the other finalists at the upcoming film festival in New York City.
Don Thompson, former president and chief executive officer of McDonald's Corp, is in a great position to influence his former boss on making its menu more sustainable.
BLOOMBERG NEWS You'd think McDonald's would be champing at the bit given the frenzy around plant-based foods. This is made all the more confusing since McDonald's former CEO, Don Thompson , sits on the board of Beyond Meat , one of the most popular plant-based burger companies in the world. It's a real head-scratcher at this point, but maybe McDonald's has something in the works for the USA and will be announcing it soon. One can only hope."
'Ramy' Review: A Seemingly Authentic Sitcom With A Muslim POV,www.forbes.com,Merrill Barr,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/merrillbarr/2019/04/14/ramy-review-hulu-ramy-youssef-ari-katcher-ryan-welch-jerrod-carmichael/,"Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin
Ramy on Hulu
Hulu Without being a member of a particular culture, it’s always difficult to determine how authentic a particular story is when it rests so heavily on the tropes and dynamics of said culture. But, even without a basis to judge authenticness, every great story of this type always carries a detectable level of authority that says “I know what I’m talking about.” Mr. Robot had it, One Day at a Time had it, and now it can be said Hulu’s latest half-hour, Ramy , has it too.
Co-created by and starring Ramy Youssef, Ramy follows the life of a young Muslim man living in New York City as he attempts to navigate dating life for the first time with a desire to date a Muslim woman.
There’s a lot of love about Ramy. It’s lead is highly entertaining, and the show does follow the cardinal rule of sitcoms which is funny first and funny always. But, while maintaining the funny, it does not fall into the trap many other of its type do. The show manages to keep up the representation throughout no matter what. It has its cake and eats it too. Never opting to pick between the two.
Something about the POV of Ramy feels like it’s coming from a real place many are not privy to. A place of how things are done and why and how many of those ways are outdated in relation to modern culture for the young ones is predominately present and appreciated throughout the series.
Even more so worth nothing is how relatable Ramy feels while still being unique in the aforementioned POV. The problems Ramy deals with, particularly in the terms of being an ever-present disappointment to his supremely religious parents so long as he remains single, are not unique to the main character’s culture. In fact, by going so specific, what has emerged is a wholly relatable experience that really delivers on the soul of what it’s trying to achieve.
Overall, Ramy is a worthy addition to the television landscape and is one audiences should be supremely excited for. In time, it could grow into one of those cultural mainstays viewers can’t stop talking about. If Hulu does its job and gets the show in front of the right eyeballs, we could be looking at the next One Day at a Time in terms of beloved representation. And who can’t be interested in that?
Ramy premieres Friday, April 19th on Hulu

Road Warrior: Lifechanging Gmail Hacks You Need On Your Next Business Trip,www.forbes.com,Suzanne Rowan Kelleher,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2019/04/14/road-warrior-the-gmail-hacks-you-need-on-your-next-business-trip/,"You can’t outrun them. There’s no escape. Try as you might to delete, reply and forward your way to “inbox zero,” the relentless onslaught of email messages just keeps coming. Many would argue that taming an inbox is even harder for business travelers, who often find themselves on a plane or in a rental car without a way to easily stay connected.
Productivity guru David Allen, author of the bestseller Getting Things Done , asks himself the following questions when deciding how to manage email when he's traveling:
How much can I clean/clear/organize before I leave for the airport, so I don't have to think about it during the trip? How long can I go without having to respond to emails? (Have I structured my communication agreements for others to handle vs. me?) How much can I leave for dealing with in the airport lounge for the hour I'm likely to have there before boarding? How much time am I capable or interested in dealing with email once I'm located in the new place? How accessible to email response and cleanup can I be on a plane or train? On the last point, Allen says, “ Sometimes that's my most productive place, given Wi-Fi access or no need for that. ”
Tim Ferriss, who wrote the bestseller The 4-Hour Workweek , is all for embracing limited access to email. Ferriss has called email “ the single largest interruption in modern life .” He swears by a less-is-more practice he calls “batching,” which entails limiting how often you tackle emails to just two or three times a day. The strategy is designed to give yourself the necessary head space to be productive while ensuring you never miss anything important.
Ferriss is one of the 1.5 billion people worldwide who use Gmail, Google’s free email, which celebrated its 15 th birthday earlier this month. But despite Gmail’s enormous popularity, relatively few users tap into its full potential, oblivious to the ever-growing number of smart features and over 100 extensions designed to make their lives easier.
Do you have 15 minutes? That’s all it takes to set up a few simple Gmail hacks that will boost your productivity away from home.
Create a label for your next trip.
You can KonMari your inbox with Gmail labels.
Gmail There’s nothing worse than an important email getting lost in the black hole of your inbox – especially when you’re standing in line at an airport or hotel front desk. Gmail’s labeling system helps you organize emails — and if you really want to geek out, you can even color code them so they really pop.
Labels are the Marie Kondo of Gmail; they allow every message to have its place. You can label an email as you’re composing it. You can label a received email directly from the inbox or from inside an open email, and you can use filters to automatically label incoming emails from specific addresses or domains.
Travelers can make the most of Gmail by creating temporary labels for what's needed in the moment. Let’s say you have an upcoming trip to Chicago. Create a label called “Chicago Trip” and tag relevant emails containing your itinerary, confirmation numbers, meeting times and places, agendas and so on. If you like, you can even create sublabels, such as “Chicago Trip/Travel,” “Chicago Trip/Meeting” or “Chicago Trip/Sales Deck.” Now you’ve got everything you need for your trip at your fingertips.
How to create Gmail labels .
Declutter with Priority Inbox.
Too many emails to handle? Gmail will help you set priorities.
Screenshot/Suzanne Kelleher If you’re overwhelmed with the sheer volume of incoming emails, Gmail will help you sort them. Choosing the ""Priority Inbox"" setting tells Google how to display your emails in order of importance.
Gmail will automatically funnel your emails into the four sections of your choosing; for example: important and unread, unread, starred, and everything else. But for travelers, the true power of Priority Inbox lies in its flexibility, since you can change the order of how your inbox is displayed on the fly.
Before your business trip, for example, you might designate your “Chicago Trip” label as one of the four Priority Inbox sections, as in: unread, Chicago Trip, starred, everything else. Now when you look at your inbox, unread messages are still up top, followed by everything you need for your trip.
How to set up Priority Inbox .
Dismiss low-priority emails until later with Snooze.
Too many low-priority emails in your inbox? Snooze them until you're ready to deal with them.
Screenshot/Suzanne Kelleher Ever wish you could tell an email to go away and come back later? Gmail’s Snooze button makes any email leave your inbox until you are ready for it. You decide exactly when the email returns.
Snoozing an email that doesn't need my attention immediately lets me focus on other imminent things on hand,” says Sireesha Narumanchi, founder of Crowd Work News , an online resource for finding work-at-home jobs. Narumanchi finds Snooze particularly helpful when she’s traveling. “This feature saves me from getting lost in email-checking in the most productive times of the day. I can always check the snoozed emails later when I have more time to tackle them. ”
How to use Snooze .
Send emails later with Boomerang.
Working into the wee hours? Tell Boomerang to send your email arrive at 9 am.
Screenshot/Suzanne Kelleher The Gmail add-on that Tim Ferriss can't live without is a nifty email scheduler that's been around since 2010 and just keeps getting better.
With Boomerang installed, you'll see Gmail's regular send button and also a Send Later button, which lets you optimize an email’s delivery time to suit your situation. Emailing someone in a different time zone? Type your contact’s time zone right into the calendar window, and it will compute the right time so you don't have to do the calculation yourself. (Boomerang's basic plan starts at about $84 per year. See pricing .)
Boomerang’s founder, Alex Moore, was an early adopter of Gmail. “I had a friend in college who interviewed at Google and got a Gmail invite before almost anybody else,” he says.
One of Moore’s favorite Boomerang hacks is to automate a follow-up when you email someone and get an out-of-office bounce. If your contact is getting back to the office on Monday, you can schedule your message to send on, say, Tuesday morning. But here’s the trick: Be sure to check the box next to the Send Later button that says “if no reply.”
“Now you've got your follow-up completely automated if they don't get back to you,” says Moore. “And if they do, it never sends.”
I personally love this plugin because I have clients all over the world in different times zones,” says Marie Flounoy, a multimedia consultant at Bitter NYC , a creative agency. Even if she is working at 3 a.m., “Boomerang allows me to send emails at what looks like an appropriate time or during normal business hours. ”
Tip: Use Boomerang to send yourself reminders for important tasks. For example, send yourself an email called “Check into flight” and use Send Later to bring it back to you exactly 24 hours before your departure time.
Take a breather with Inbox Pause.
Need to take a break from Gmail? Hit the pause button.
Screenshot/Suzanne Kelleher If the constant siren call of your inbox is preventing you from getting stuff done, one of Boomerang’s coolest features lets you temporarily pause Gmail for as long as you like. You can also program this feature to deliver emails in batches, at certain times of the day instead of constantly.
Inbox Pause is useful when you're traveling because you can let your contacts know that you're unavailable for pockets of time. You can set a customized outgoing autoresponder message to let people know when your inbox is paused and when you'll be back.
Need to make an exception for your boss or an important client? Simply white-list the senders you want to allow past the gatekeeper.
How to use Boomerang’s Inbox Pause .
Send disappearing emails in Confidential Mode.
Program your most sensitive emails to self destruct on cue.
Screenshot/Suzanne Kelleher Nervous about sending an email with sensitive information? You can put an expiration date on an email and schedule it to expire at a certain time, just like in “Mission: Impossible” but without the puff of smoke. You can even add an additional safeguard by requiring a passcode that Google will send to the recipient via text message.
Learn how to use Confidential Mode .
Save oodles of time with Canned Responses.
Sick of typing the same email for the 27th time? Use a templated shortcut.
Screenshot/Suzanne Kelleher For many of us, it’s always Groundhog Day, as we find ourselves composing what is essentially the same email over and over. Forget cutting and pasting and say hello to Canned Responses, which lets you store templates for emails that you send all the time. With a few clicks you can populate your email with your pre-written message, tweak if necessary, and hit send.
Every minute of my day is valuable,” says Ian McClarty, CEO of PhoenixNAP , a global IT services provider, who has more than 10 templated responses set up in Gmail. “The thought of sending out a premade email sounds terrible at first. But 99 percent of the time, I use the response template as a starting point and make sure to personalize the email reply. ”
To get started composing a Canned Response, click on the three vertical dots next to the garbage-can icon at the bottom right corner of the email.
Fast forward with Smart Compose.
Save yourself time and precious keystrokes with Smart Compose.
Screenshot/Suzanne Kelleher Another major time saver, Smart Compose is like an assistant editor uses AI to auto-complete your sentences for you. Even if you’re a speedy typist, this feature can save you a surprising amount of time.
For example, if you type, “Do you have an update for me?” and then hit the space bar and the letter P, Smart Compose might extend it to “Please let me know.” To accept the suggestion, hit the tab key; to override it, just keep typing.
How to set up Smart Compose .
Tip: Want your grammar checked, too? Add the Grammarly extender to your toolbox.
Get alerted when your email is opened with MailTrack.
Stop wondering if your email was opened.
Mailtrack If you waste a lot of energy wondering if people have seen your emails, MailTrack belongs in your toolkit. This add-on tracks your message and sends you an alert when it is opened — super handy if you’re dithering about whether you should follow up or sit back. (The basic version of Mailtrack is free. If you don’t want your recipient to know you’re tracking correspondence, you can upgrade to the pro version for $59 per year.)
This is the ‘Fight Club’ of Gmail plugins,” says Ashley Huffman, who works in operations at Nano Magnetics , a product innovation company specializing in magnets. “When you know someone opened your email, you can rest assured they have the info or update. It's great for emergency messages! ”
(Mailtrack is a standout because it's free, but if you subscribe to Boomerang, note that it offers its own includes a tracking feature called Read Receipts .)
Integrate your favorite productivity tools into Gmail.
Does your team communicate via Slack? Are you a Trello disciple? Whatever tool you use to work efficiently, there’s likely a plugin that dovetails seamlessly into Gmail. Some of the most popular add-ons are:
Trello Slack Asana Evernote Zapier Dropbox Zoom HubSpot Todoist Try just one or two of these hacks, and you’ll almost certainly notice a boost in efficiency. Try them all and you might even start to love your email."
"For Venezuela, Producing Onions More Important Than Producing Oil",www.forbes.com,Kenneth Rapoza,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2019/04/14/for-venezuela-producing-onions-more-important-than-producing-oil/,"On April 10, Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro took to Twitter to do what he does best: praise the Bolivar Revolution's struggle and blame the Western world for all of his country's problems. Indeed, Maduro's entire Twitter feed is this type of commentary. But on that particular day, the president took to praising his country's productive capacity. It was all focused on Venezuela's agribusiness, with one tweet praising Venezuela's onion harvest. Yes, onions. Some 3,000 acres of it, planted by peace-loving small family farmers, not those big commercial operations selling to Cargill. That would be bad. They are doing it for the revolution.
Of all things: onions; a non-commodity mostly used to add taste to rice and salads and maybe a steak, an animal protein that most Venezuelans can no longer afford. Irrelevant. For Maduro, the country's rural production is growing like gangbusters.

— Nicolás Maduro (@NicolasMaduro) April 11, 2019
While most developing countries are busy investing in things like roads, bridges, airports, capital goods, artificial intelligence, the blockchain, generic pharmaceuticals, e-commerce platforms, and telecommunications systems, Venezuela is stuck in its romantic pre-Colombia times, where living off the land is sacrosanct. Everything else is akin to ""working for the man.""
Meanwhile, the one commodity that Venezuela depends on to keep its lights on, fund its public school system (perhaps to educate farmers on water and land management) and its state-owned hospitals, is failing. That's oil, of course.
It's not the low oil price that's hurt Venezuela. It's terrible management, the near destruction of the private sector in the oil industry, and a kleptocracy at the top of the Venezuelan government's food chain that's hobbled its flagship enterprise, PdVSA.

Getty In March, Venezuela’s oil production fell to 870,000 barrels per day according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The average daily production for the month decreased by 270,000 barrels, or 24% lower than the month before. Looked at over a 12 month period, PdVSA is producing around 41% less than a year ago, according to IEA.
Rolling blackouts have played a big role in the shortfall. Over the last four weeks, the entire country has been plagued with electrical problems, problems Maduro blames on the U.S. and opposition parties in Caracas for sabotage.
Also worth noting, U.S. sanctions on PdVSA crude oil means no more exports starting April 28. Many PdVSA clients have already been winding down purchases. Sanctions require that all existing sales of Venezuelan crude oil be kept in a locked bank account owned by the company in the U.S. and cannot be repatriated until sanctions are lifted.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano) photo credit: ASSOCIATED PRESS
Venezuela told OPEC that national crude oil production in March would hit 960,000 barrels. OPEC estimates that the country extracted only 732,000 barrels a day in March and 1.02 million barrels in February. For comparison, Venezuela produced 2.4 million barrels per day in 2015, a year before its economic crisis began.
OPEC has asked member states to reduce production, so this also has to be considered. But PdVSA oil output has been slipping for years due to lackluster investment. Even with lower output from OPEC members, $70 barrel of oil has barely kept Venezuela afloat. The country has been dependent on China and Russia loans for the past three years and is now open to humanitarian aid from Red Cross International. This is not a country firing on all four cylinders. Even if its onion farmers are planting like never before."
Here Are Eight Predictions For Season 8 Of 'Game Of Thrones',www.forbes.com,Erik Kain,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/04/14/here-are-eight-predictions-for-season-8-of-game-of-thrones/,"Game of Thrones is almost upon us. Season 8 will be the show's last, wrapping up all the myriad storylines and conflicts and settling the war over the Iron Throne, and for the fate of humanity itself, once and for all. So what will happen? How will this whole thing end? Who will win and who will lose in this final game of thrones? Let's make some predictions.
1 - Nobody will sit on the Iron Throne in the end. I get a lot of Game of Thrones pitches from various PR agencies. One of the most common has to do with betting. I guess Game of Thrones inspires a lot of that. Who will die? What are the odds? This season I see a lot of ""Such-and-such's odds of ruling Westeros"" and the like. Will it be Gendry? Will it be Sam? Will it be Arya?
It will be nobody. That's my guess. At one point during a conversation between Dany and Tyrion in the Season 6 finale, Daenerys says something that I think we should all pay heed to leading into Season 8.
Daenerys Targaryen: Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell they're all just spokes on a wheel. This ones on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins crushing those on the ground.
Tyrion Lannister: It's a beautiful dream, stopping the wheel. You're not the first person who's ever dreamt it.
Daenerys Targaryen: I'm not going to stop the wheel, I'm going to break the wheel.
This leads me to think, whoever comes out on top in the end, that the Iron Throne will no longer be the seat of power in Westeros, and that somehow Dany (or her followers if she doesn't make it) will bring real social change to the Seven Kingdoms. My second guess would be Daenerys on the throne, or her and Jon Snow ruling together.
2 - All the dragons will die. Dragons gotta go.
Credit: HBO Sorry if this bums you out, but I don't think the dragons are going to make it. We've already seen one turn into an ice dragon, the Night King's fancy new ride. In the end, I think the dragons will die in battle, fighting their lost brother.
Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion will fall, as the age of high magic and dragons is long gone in this world. These dragons were a small blip, intended to help end this final clash between good and evil.
3 - The White Walkers will be stopped at great cost. The White Walkers will leave their mark.
Credit: HBO I don't think that Game of Thrones will have a really dark ending, and I don't think it will have a really happy ending. I think it will be ""bittersweet"" as author George R.R. Martin has indicated (for his books, at least).
The Night King and the White Walkers will be stopped, through some combination of heroism, dragons, magic and Bran (though it's still possible Bran is the Night King vis-a-vis time travel and twisted magic gone awry).
Cersei and her forces will also be stopped, and much blood will be shed all around. I'm not sure who will die, but I think the bulging cast will be whittled down quite a bit. It's just impossible to say who dies and who lives, but if I had to guess on survivors it would be Sam and Gilly, Sansa, Davos and
4 - We will finally get CleganeBowl. Fight!!!
Credit: HBO Yep, it's finally going to happen. Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane will fight and kill his brother Gregor 'The Mountain Zombie' Clegane. The Mountain has killed plenty, and done horrible things for his Lannister masters. He killed the Viper in one of the show's best fight scenes ever. And he gave his little brother all those burns when they were kids.
Now, in the final season, we'll get the fan service we so badly desire, and the revenge that the Hound has so desperately needed for so long now. The fight will come, it will be brutal, and the Hound will win. He may actually die in the fight—honestly, I think it's quite likely that he will—but he'll die knowing that his monstrous brother has finally died, and for good this time.
5 - Jon Snow and Daenerys won't live happily ever after. I just can't do this anymore, aunt Dany.
Credit: HBO It's entirely possible that Dany won't care that she and Jon Snow are related. The Targaryen's never really did mind the whole incest thing. But I do think she'll be upset when she discovers that Jon is actually next in line for the Iron Throne (even if she does, ultimately, want to ""break the wheel."")
Jon, on the other hand, is more Stark than Targaryen and much, much more concerned with traditions and doing the right thing. That generally does not include sleeping with one's aunt, no matter how attractive she may be. I don't think he'll be at all okay to learn that the woman he's just begun sleeping with is a close blood relative. And he will learn it because the truth of his parentage will come out this season.
6 - Jaime will kill Cersei. I just can't do this anymore, sis.
Credit: HBO Jaime left King's Landing and his sister's court at the end of Season 7. He rode north, and we've seen images of him dressed in Northern armor. There's no doubt in my mind that the Lannister heir has gone over to the other side, refusing to stand by while his sister continues to plot and conspire.
I think it's only fitting that he's the one to finally kill her—or at least be there when she dies. It's entirely possible that she'll die of suicide or in some other way, but no matter what happens, Jaime will be there. I think he might be the one to kill her for a few reasons. He's already ""Kingslayer"" for one thing. That's a nickname he got for killing the man he was sworn to protect as a King's Guard. Then again, the Mad King Aerys had it coming. And so does the Mad Queen Cersei.
""The things I do for love,"" Jaime once said. Indeed.
7 - The season will feel too short and too rushed. Who are you calling too short?
Credit: HBO I love Game of Thrones, but I was sorely disappointed by Season 7. I worry—a lot—that I'll be just as disappointed by Season 8.
Season 7 was so rushed, with so many convoluted plots and so many instances of characters acting like idiots, that it felt like the whole thing was just glued together as fast as possible and then pushed out with fancy special effects.
The story of political drama, carefully constructed characters, and choice and consequences, was abandoned in favor of big set-pieces and fast travel.
I have no reason to suspect that Season 8 will be any different, though I really hope I'm wrong on this point. I want this to be a great season with an ending that shakes us to our cores. I worry it's going to be more like when Sansa and Arya ""trick"" Littlefinger and kill him on the spot. That was like the showrunners trying to be as clever and exciting as Martin is but missing just about everything that Martin does to weave a good story.
8 - The ending will inspire George R.R. Martin to write. Write like the winds of winter, George, you beautiful bastard.
Credit: HBO I happily and freely admit this is just wishful thinking on my part. But if I were Martin, and I saw the TV show lap my books, I'd be inspired to write more and write faster. If I saw my greatest work finished before I finished it, with an ending that wasn't really the ending I planned, I'd want to set the record straight.
If I were George R.R. Martin I would want the true story to be told, not this adaptation, not the fanfic this show has become. This is especially true ever since showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss decided that they wanted to hurry up and finish the show as fast as possible so that they could move on to other projects (like Star Wars ).
I still don't understand why HBO didn't just hand the show over to new showrunners so that they could get at least one more season out of this. Or two season of 10 episodes instead of two seasons with 7 and 6 episodes respectively. Even Martin thinks the show is wrapping up too soon.
Well, he's the only one who can fix this mess and the only way he can do it is to release The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring before, well, before it's too late.
That's all folks.
I'm trying not to be too hyper-specific with these predictions because Game of Thrones is at its best when it defies expectations and throws some curveballs at us. For all I know, Cersei will remain on the Iron Throne. And Jon will remain King in the North. And Daenerys will sacrifice herself to stop the Night King, leaving all of Westeros in a massive, bloody stalemate.
But that feels too inconclusive. I honestly don't know how this should all end, and I don't envy HBO's team or Martin the impossible task of doing it in a way that will satisfy everybody. I guess we'll know at least a little bit more this evening when Game of Thrones returns for its Season 8 premiere.
Look for my review right here after the episode.
I made seven predictions for Season 7 of 'Game Of Thrones.' I got a few right, a few wrong. Not bad."
Even Student Council Elections Are Being Hacked Now,www.forbes.com,Lee Mathews,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2019/04/14/even-student-council-elections-are-being-hacked-now/,"If you want to hold a legitimate election in 2019, you need to make absolutely certain that the voting systems can't be hacked. If recent history has taught us anything, it's that insecure systems will almost certainly fall victim to hackers.

Getty It's an extremely serious concern for federal, state, and municipal elections. Believe it or not, election hacking is a very real threat even in student council elections.
Berkeley High School in California recently held its first-ever student council election where votes could be submitted electronically. The school didn't use sophisticated e-voting software, and understandably so. Instead, students submitted their votes via email.
Around 2400 students were eligible to vote. As the weeklong voting period wrapped up, staff and students noticed something strange going on. A torrent of votes was streaming in, cast only for two of the candidates. The votes ""were coming in in mass quantities at all times of day and night,"" said director of student activities John Villavicencio told Westport News .
The school took a closer look at the votes. They had been cast by students in alphabetical order and sent from a single computer.
Coincidence? Not a chance.
The two candidates had gained access to a database that contained their fellow students' school-supplied Gmail addresses and student IDs -- which featured prominently in default passwords.
Most people don't feel compelled to change a default password for an account that they won't be using regularly or won't use for anything they feel is all that important. At Berkeley, at least 500 students left their default passwords unchanged.
The information they accessed -- and a generous helping of spare time -- was all the two candidates needed to launch their offensive. Once the school discovered what was going on, both were immediately disqualified.
What happens to them now remains to be seen. Lexie Tesch, Berkeley's new student body president and vice president Daijah Conerly don't think disqualification is enough. Conerly told a reporter that she feels ""he should at least be suspended because he betrayed his school and his classmates."""
Council Post: How To Create Truly Effective Development Plans,www.forbes.com,Dr. Joel M. Rothaizer,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2019/04/11/how-to-create-truly-effective-development-plans/,"Leaders spend a great deal of time on development plans for themselves and their direct reports. But despite this planning, my business partner and I observed that many development plans do not always lead to real changes in how people think and act. In our opinion, you do not change from reading books, attending courses or hearing powerful speakers. I also believe you do not change your employees by solely providing generic training sessions, such as how to create respectful workplaces, hold difficult conversations or engage others. At best, these activities generate awareness. My partner frequently says that awareness does not equal change, and I agree. To create development plans that have a lasting impact, you have to commit to the changes you want to make and take a deep look at yourself in the process.
Let’s say you heard something meaningful in a podcast, learned a valuable lesson in a training, recognized a bad habit you'd like to quit or discovered something from a 360-degree review that deserves attention. How can you implement these new ideas, and how can you make them a reality?
When developing a process for creating effective development plans, my business partner and I have determined the following steps to be critical:
1. Start small with a daily reflection.
In the morning, think about the changes you’d like to make. For example, you might say, “Rather than always giving advice, I’d like to ask more open-ended and curious questions.” Think about the opportunities that might arise during the day to apply this skill, and find ways to remind yourself of your goal.
Then, at the end of the day, reflect on how it went. Celebrate what went well and the positive impact it had. Also pay attention to any missed opportunities with compassion and curiosity, rather than self-criticism. Change is hard, but my partner and I have found that if you consistently pay attention over time, you’ll be surprised to eventually discover new positive habits have developed.
2. Implement quick bursts of reflection throughout your day.
Take your reflection one step further by adding quick bursts of reflection throughout your day to help you move even closer to your ultimate goal. For instance, before going to a meeting, ask yourself about the desired outcome, not only for you but also for those attending. If you’re meeting with a direct report, what do you want their experience to have been?
Think both about ""task"" results (i.e., clarity on next steps or how to handle a difficult situation) and ""people"" results (i.e., increased confidence, deepened trust between you, higher engagement). Then, ask yourself what you can do to optimize that result. After the meeting, reflect on what happened. Celebrate what worked, including the impact, and consider what you might do differently next time to be even more effective. These cycles can be 30 seconds before and after meetings. Throughout my time as a coach, my clients have described how powerful these mini bursts of reflection are and how little time it takes to be exponentially more effective.
Why is change so hard? Humans are habitual creatures. My partner and I have learned it truly takes practice — these ongoing cycles of action and reflection — to slowly develop new habits of thinking and acting. I believe it more than pays off if it means developing new and more productive habits.
In my opinion, this type of reflection is no different than what it takes to get better at a sport. What does your favorite team do right after a game? They likely watch a game film to look carefully at what they did well and what they could do better. From my perspective, increasing your leadership capacity is no different.
3. Share your goals with others.
Examining what (or who) in your current context supports your goals is also an important step in creating an effective development plan. What could get in your way? How can you use this analysis to add specific strategies to your development plan? This answer varies for everyone. For example, do you have colleagues who would encourage and support you, if asked?
Throughout our time developing these steps, my partner and I observed that for many leaders, the single biggest factor in making real change is sharing with others what you want to accomplish, as well as asking others for their support. They can hold you accountable by pointing out where they see change and where they see old behaviors. Publicly declaring your goals also invites ongoing feedback and support. Ensure your team knows it's safe to offer their constructive criticism by thanking them for their feedback and showing them how important their advice is to you.
Start with two or three items you'd like to improve on so that you don't become overwhelmed, and ask your direct reports to do the same. What are the highest-leverage things all of you could focus on? What changes would have the greatest impact? Then, develop a daily practice of action and reflection. I believe your lives will change for the better.

Cannabis Sellers Prepare As '4/20 Holiday' Appeal Broadens,www.forbes.com,Julie Weed,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/julieweed/2019/04/14/cannabis-sellers-prepare-as-the-420-holiday-appeal-broadens/,"Getting high on April 20th has transformed over the past five years from a “stoner holiday” to a more broadly accepted occasion, so retailers are getting prepared for long lines, crowds, and less experienced consumers who need more help. April 20th is consistently the single biggest day in cannabis sales and because this year the date lands on a Saturday, marijuana retailers should expect double their typical sales on April 20 as well as significant increases on Friday April 19 th . That’s according to the cannabis software and analytics company Headset based in Seattle, which has collected sales data around the 4/20 timeframe for the last four years from its partner-stores in Washington State, California, Nevada, and Colorado. The company has a catalog of over 330,000 products and has recorded $4.5 billion of transactions.
Flowhub a point of sale and inventory management company based in Colorado predicts that the most popular categories on 4/20 will be items that are easily shareable and more approachable to newer consumers like dried smokable flower, cannabis-infused edibles, and pre-rolls (joints).
Despite growth in the day’s overall sales this April 20 th however, individual stores will notice increased competition and decreasing price points in mature cannabis states like Colorado and Oregon according to Flowhub .
While baby boomers returning to cannabis or trying it for the first time may have the most time and money, there are other important customer segments. The oldest members of Generation Z, now 21 and 22 years old, will be the newest 4/20 customers and retailers should focus on “capturing their attention and wallets” as they enter the market, advised Headset.
4/20 began as the chance for people to let their support for legalization be known, said Tim Moxey founder of Mr. Moxey’s Mints . Now with legalization spreading it’s become more of a celebration of cannabis he said, “but it’s important to reflect on the past and remind ourselves that it’s still illegal federally and the journey isn’t yet over.” Moxey encourages people to make their voice heard and use the day to show that cannabis “can really be a part of anyone’s life.”
And while 4/20 is still the original cannabis holiday, stay tuned later this year to see how a new holiday shapes up. Green Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving, is gaining traction as a time when people stock up for the long weekend with relatives.

The Courage To Wait For A Balanced Wine,www.forbes.com,Cathrine Todd,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathrinetodd/2019/04/14/the-courage-to-wait-for-a-balanced-wine/,"The 2017 vintage was a tough one for the famous Côte-d'Or region of Burgundy, France. According to Frédéric Weber, cellar master for Bouchard Père & Fils , it was the first time that they had received frost in their vineyards “since 2011” and near the time of harvest they had “hot temperatures around 35-36C [95-97F].” Due to this heat wave, it was tempting for Frédéric to harvest early, yet from experience he knew he needed patience as the pips and skins of the grapes were not yet ripe. Luckily, he was rewarded with rain and significantly cooler weather at the end of August that refreshed the vines as well as the longer hang time that brought a balanced maturity to the grapes that made the wines “pleasurable” to taste, even immediately after vinification. It was a great lesson in finding the courage to wait for balance, not only in regards to making wine but also in a person’s life. Bouchard Père & Fils
Bouchard Père & Fils was founded in 1731 and is not only one of Burgundy’s oldest wine houses but it is one of the largest landowners in the Côte-d'Or with 30 Grand Cru and 183 Premier Cru vineyards. Their Beaune Grèves Premier Cru ‘Vigne de L'Enfant Jésus’, nicknamed Baby Jesus, is sought out by Burgundy wine connoisseurs as a wine that gives depth of expression as well as a capacity for long aging. Their cellar master, Frédéric, knows each of the plots like they were his own children because to be the cellar master for some of the most prized vineyards in the world, anything less would not be acceptable.

2017 Vintage
The 2017 vintage in the Côte-d'Or was a tough and extremely stressful one. Frédéric noted that the extremes of frost, heat waves and storms were peppered throughout the year – basically Bouchard Père & Fils faced most of the toughest climatic challenges from years past, all in one vintage. Frédéric said it was the type of vintage that tortured winemakers like him with crushing stress but that eventually gave joy in the winery with “soft tannins, lots of fruit and a high definition of terroir.” But, to the credit of Bouchard Père & Fils, to combat the weather they put tons of work into the vineyards creating shade for the grapes by using the leaves of the vines to shield the fruit yet making sure there was plenty of aeration to avoid disease.
What’s the Hurry?
It is interesting when a person hits mid-life and reflects on her youth and wonders, “What was the hurry?” In every generation, many young people feel that if they haven’t accomplished certain things by a particular age then they are a failure. But that sense of urgency during a time of life when no one really knows who they are or the realities of the outside world does not lead to a balanced life, just like it does not lead to a balanced wine.
Empire State Building Through a Glass of 2017 Bouchard Père & Fils
Cathrine Todd Expression of Place
One of Frédéric’s favorite aspects about the 2017 vintage is its unobstructed expression of place, a.k.a. terroir. As he was out with his team everyday in August tasting the grapes from a multitude of plots, he knew that, yes, the sugar was there for a balanced alcohol level, but if he didn’t give the skins, pips and stalks of the grape bunches a chance to mature, then each site would not be able to completely express itself. Frédéric likes to use a small percentage of whole cluster fermentation (when the grape bunches are kept whole rather than removing the grapes from the stem) but it is not possible in some vintages because of the risk of extracting green tannins. In 2017 he increased his whole cluster percentage by 15% in the Côte de Beaune and 30-50% in the Côte de Nuits.
Sometimes a young person is told to wear blinders to achieve ‘sugar’ in life – those things that immediately and obviously spell success to the outside world – but it is at the detriment of maturing his structure; later he may be incapable of not only expressing himself but even knowing himself. In the long run, it is worth it to allow the rest of the world to blast past him in the fast lane so he can find a true sense of self and his place in the world. And even if one gets it wrong during the first half of his life, there are always many more vintages to follow to find the courage to wait for balance.
Lineup of Bouchard Père & Fils 2017 Bottles
Cathrine Todd Any wine that notes “Domaine” on the label comes from Bouchard’s own vineyards, and when that word is omitted from the title then the grapes were bought; these purchased grapes come from growers that have had a long relationship with Bouchard Père & Fils. For the purchased grapes, note that Bouchard is extremely involved in the way the vineyards are maintained as well as harvested. Also, it is the Bouchard tradition to taste reds before whites, hence the order of the tasting notes below.
Reds
2017 Bouchard Père & Fils, Santenay, Côte de Beaune: Pretty nose, flowers, soft tannins, juicy body and fresh strawberries.
2017 Bouchard Père & Fils, Savigny-Lès-Beaune, Côte de Beaune: Beautiful nose with lots of perfume, intense with ripe red fruit, red cherry, riper than Santenay.
2017 Bouchard Père & Fils, Nuits-Saint-Georges, Côte de Nuits: Lush blackberry flavors with an underlying note of earth that had broad yet rounded tannins. Frédéric said, “classically, people think of Nuits-Saint-Georges as being masculine but I do not feel this way.” He pointed out that it was a matter of unlocking what is in the terroir by reaching a good maturity with the grapes as well as using whole clusters of grapes when one can, 30% of which was used in 2017.
2017 Bouchard Père & Fils, Gevrey-Chambertin, Côte de Nuits: Vivid black cherry, not tight like many Gevrey-Chambertin would be at such a youthful stage, with big shoulder structure.
2017 Bouchard Père & Fils, Beaune Clos de la Mousse Premier Cru, Côte de Beaune (Monople/Domaine): This is a monopole Premier Cru - a vineyard wholly controlled by a single winery – that has been owned by Bouchard Père & Fils since 1872 and the vineyard dates back to 1220. Sweet fruit that caressed the palate with a long, complex finish – a great wine.
2017 Bouchard Père & Fils, Beaune Grèves Premier Cru, ‘Vigne de L'Enfant Jésus’, Côte de Beaune (Exclusivity/Domaine): This ‘Vigne de L'Enfant Jésus,’ nicknamed the Baby Jesus wine, is a legendary wine that has been considered the best plot in the Beaune Grèves (mid-slope, sunny place) that Bouchard exclusively owns. Soft, delicate tannins, a refreshing minty note with a background of wild flowers and a great depth of concentration and character.
2017 Bouchard Père & Fils, Volnay Les Caillerets Premier Cru, Côte de Beaune (Domaine): Les Caillerets is the old french word for ‘limestone’. The old saying is if you don’t know Caillerets than you don’t know Volnay. A pretty nose with good energy and the palate was laced with limestone notes and finesse on the finish.
2017 Bouchard Père & Fils, Le Corton Grand Cru, Côte de Beaune (Domaine): Lots of limestone from this estate owned Grand Cru. Delicate, violets, roses, fine tannins, a long elegant wine with hints of chalky notes on the finish.
2017 Bouchard Père & Fils, Échezeaux Grand Cru, Côte de Nuits: Ripe, intense nose with round, generous texture that had hints of tarragon and raspberries and was shocking in its generosity and sense of place, as Échezeaux usually takes a while to show itself.
2017 Bouchard Père & Fils, Chambertin-Clos de Bèze Grand Cru, Côte de Nuits: Strong textured tannins with chalky minerality and smoky espresso notes that was balanced by dark chocolate and red cherries.
Whites
2017 Bouchard Père & Fils, Meursault ‘Les Clous’, Côte de Beaune (Domaine): Delicious with marzipan and golden apple with plenty of flesh, yet for a Meursault, it has an unexpectedly nice citrus zing.
2017 Bouchard Père & Fils, Beaune Clos Saint-Landry Premier Cru, Côte de Beaune (Monopole/Domaine): This is a monopole Premier Cru that has been owned by the Bouchard Père & Fils since 1791. Quince paste with peach skin and white stony minerality.
2017 Bouchard Père & Fils, Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru, Côte de Beaune (Domaine): Complex aromatics with exotically enticing notes of lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves that had fierce vitality and a breathtaking long, pure and expressive finish.
2017 Bouchard Père & Fils, Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru, Côte de Beaune (Domaine): The Grand Cru Chevalier-Montrachet is broken up into four different terraces with Bouchard Père & Fils being the only producer that own vineyards in each terrace. This wine impressed with saline minerality and blood orange flavors that had an intense focus from its elegant, linear shape and had toe-tingling electricity on the finish."
"A Secret Side Of Tuscany Beyond Art, Food And Wine",www.forbes.com,Anja Mutic,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/anjamutic/2019/04/14/a-secret-side-of-tuscany-beyond-art-food-and-wine/,"A hike to the summit of Abetone mountain in Tuscany Rupert Shanks The vineyard-strewn hills, ancient farms and hilltop towns of Tuscany have been luring visitors for centuries. But there's more to this Italian region than Renaissance art, pastoral landscapes and la dolce vita (read: divine food and wine). In fact, a secret side of Tuscany has come into the spotlight: the region is on the rise as one of Europe’s hottest adventure hubs.
While I have “done” typical Tuscany in the past – winery tours and farmhouse hotel stays included – last fall I experienced this striking slice of Italy in a fresh new way. On a two-day trek from the towns of Lucca to Pisa by Montepisano In Toscana , a local tour operator, I followed the Nottolini and the Medici aqueducts which supplied these towns with water for centuries. Along the way our small group learned about this ancient system, hiked through scenic forests and savored farm-to-table fare at rural restaurants. Refreshingly so, for two days while crossing the verdant Monte Pisano mountain range, we saw no other tourists. Of course, all that changed when we reached Pisa and its Leaning Tower that swarmed with crowds, as it only befits such a globally iconic site.
On the same fall trip, I tackled a thrilling via ferrata (“iron way”) on Mount Procinto, a half-day experience offered by That’s Tuscany - Active & Adventure Travel . This climbing route equipped with cables and ladders provided a unique way of seeing the Apuan Alps, a region at the northwestern edge of Tuscany that’s been declared a UNESCO Global Geopark for its outstanding geodiversity; its karst underground is known for marbles, abysses and caves. Of 120 UNESCO Global Geoparks in 33 countries in the world, two are located in Tuscany. Sunrise over Montecatini Alto in Tuscany Rupert Shanks
“Tuscany is one of the least populated regions of Italy with a high number of protected areas,” explained Irene Lariccia, director of Montepisano In Toscana. “It offers a range of outdoor activities: anything from trekking, cycling and canyoneering in untouched mountain gorges to caving, climbing, paragliding, canoeing, rafting, sailing, diving and snorkeling.”
While foodies and art aficionados are in for a treat in Tuscany, its wild and varied natural environment has been drawing in adventurers with its blueberry-studded moorland, glacial lakes, ancient beech woods, imposing karst mountains and pine-forested sea shores. There are no less than 9 natural parks in Tuscany, 81 nature reserves and 59 protected areas; they cover about 10% of the region. Activities range from trekking on the Via Francigena, a network of ancient routes that in medieval times used to link Canterbury (UK) to Rome and today attracts modern-day wayfarers; kayaking to secluded beaches in the Tuscan Archipelago National Park and paragliding from San Giuliano Terme hills (on a clear day you can actually see the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Archipelago islands from here).
Many of Tuscany’s active pursuits are still unexplored – or rarely so. One of those is ""Caving in the Heart of Monte Pisano,"" an activity only recently introduced by Montepisano In Toscana. This tour involves a roam through a cave with no artificial lighting, handrails or walkways, affording a close-up look at the subterranean beauty of stalactites, stalagmites and casting-covered walls. Montepisano In Toscana is also rolling out a new eight-day trek along the Tuscan coast: from the high mountains of the Apuan Alps in the Versilia area, crossing the Monte Pisano between Pisa and Lucca, hiking the rolling hills of the Etruscan coast with its vineyards and finishing with the wild Maremma and Argentario areas. Spectacular vistas of Abetone mountains in Tuscany Rupert Shanks
Options for adventure abound in Tuscany, ranging from soft to more serious. You can go free-riding and bouldering on Monte Amiata , a dormant volcano in the southern part, with its fairy-tale chestnut forests, a spiritual backstory ever since the Etruscan period and exceptional vistas of the cities of Siena and Arezzo, as well as the islands of the Tuscan archipelago. You can set sail around the island of Elba, dropping anchor near Napoleon Bonaparte’s former residence (he stayed on the island during his exile between 1814 and 1815). Diving and snorkeling around Elba are also stellar, showcasing scenic seagrasses, anemones and coral.
So next time you consider Tuscany, don’t stick with just food, wine and art. Think outside the box. Think adventure. Head outdoors.

"Non-Musical 'Les Mis,' With Lily Collins, David Oyelowo, Dominic West, Debuts On Masterpiece Tonight",www.forbes.com,Jane Levere,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/janelevere/2019/04/14/non-musical-les-mis-with-lily-collins-david-oyelowo-dominic-west-debuts-on-masterpiece-tonight/,"PBS’ Masterpiece tonight will bring Victor Hugo’s epic novel, Les Miserables , to life in a new, non-musical, six-episode mini-series . Dominic West ( The Affair, The Wire ) stars as Jean Valjean, the most famous fugitive in literature, with David Oyelowo (Selma, Small Island ) as his relentless pursuer, Javert. Lily Collins ( Rules Don’t Apply; Love, Rosie ) appears as the tragic seamstress, Fantine; Ellie Bamber ( Nocturnal Animals ) plays her adolescent daughter, Cosette; Olivia Colman ( The Favourite ) and Adeel Akhtar ( Unforgotten ) are Cosette’s cruel overseers, the Thénardiers; and Josh O'Connor ( The Durrells in Corfu ) is the student and reluctant revolutionary Marius, who falls in love with Cosette at first sight. West and Oyelowo also serve as executive producers.
Screenwriter Andrew Davies (Masterpiece’s Pride & Prejudice and Bleak House; House of Cards) preserves Hugo’s intricate plotting, striking historical vignettes, powerful themes and evocative characterizations.
Les Misérables opens after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, which saw Napoleon’s final defeat by the English and their allies, a quarter of a century after the French Revolution. With Napoleon’s downfall, the French monarchy is restored and the thwarted ideals of the republic go underground. For most of that quarter century, Valjean has been serving a sentence of hard labor for stealing a loaf of bread. On his release the same year as Waterloo, he immediately resorts to petty crime, risking re-arrest and a life sentence, a fate deemed a virtual certainty by his former jailer, Javert.
After this unpromising start, Valjean begins his difficult journey to redemption. But always lurking in the background is Javert, determined to bring him to justice for breaking parole and robbing a child. Establishing himself under a new name in a provincial town, Valjean seems safe at last. He prospers as a businessman and is eventually appointed mayor. One day, he gives work to a needy young woman, Fantine, who hides the fact that she is the unwed mother of a child named Cosette. As the plot unfolds, the stories of mother and daughter become inextricably entwined with that of Valjean.
Also enmeshed in the plot are Monsieur and Madame Thénardier, an abusive innkeeping couple who become Cosette’s guardians. Two of the Thénardiers’ children, Éponine and Gavroche, go on to play heroic roles in the Paris Uprising of 1832, which is led by the romantic idealist Enjolras. The story reaches its climax during the uprising, and features an iconic escape scene through the sewers of Paris, which made the underground tunnels one of the most famous engineering marvels in the world.
At a panel discussion with the series’ lead actors in New York last week, West called Valjean “the greatest hero in literature, a proto-superhero. What’s so moving is that an animal who’s been brutalized is touched by compassion.
“Most drama happens now on the phone. The great thing about period shows is that you get to ride horses, wear period clothes. It’s wonderful,” he added.
On a more serious note, Oyelowo suggested that “Western society is built on the back of indentured servitude. What’s kept it going are disproportionate sentences given to people of color or people who are deprived—they keep the prison industrial complex going. This is something we want the show to be, to speak to now—that’s why it’s as edgy, gritty and smelly as it is. It’s not a chocolate box that looks frilly and pretty.”"
Two Great Dividend Stocks You Should Buy Before May (Like This FTSE 100 Giant),www.forbes.com,Royston Wild,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/roystonwild/2019/04/14/three-great-dividend-stocks-you-should-buy-before-may-like-this-ftse-100-giant/,"Harry Potter publisher Bloomsbury is scheduled to release next results in late May. Getty These companies have plenty of chance to deliver strong share price growth next month. Now’s a great time to go shopping, then.
Bloomsbury Publishing
Full-year numbers for Bloomsbury Publishing are scheduled for Tuesday, May 21, and if March’s trading update is anything to go by I’m expecting another cheery market reception.
The House of Harry (Potter) can still rely on the escapades of the boy wizard to keep earnings rising year after year and for cash flows to continue impressing. But Bloomsbury isn’t a one-trick pony and it has a broad range of global bestsellers to drive the top line across its fiction and non-fiction titles.
What really gets me excited, though, is the vast investment the small cap is devoting to its Academic and Professional division, an area which is ripe with potential and which the company declared put in another “strong performance” in the 12 months to February 2019.
It’s not a shock to find that City analysts are expecting profits growth at Bloomsbury to rev from low-single-digit percentages in fiscal 2019 to 14% in this year, then, and for dividends to keep rising through this period. Thus an 8.3p per share annual dividend is forecast for the present period, resulting in a chubby 3.7% yield.
The publishing colossus looks in great condition to make good on these forecasts as well. Not only are predicted rewards covered by anticipated profits by two times, bang on the widely-regarded security benchmark, but Bloomsbury’s position as a terrific cash creator -- net cash leapt to £27m as of February from £16.9m six months earlier -- also sets it in good stead to keep hiking shareholder payouts.
Reckitt Benckiser
Another great income share to buy today is Reckitt Benckiser Group as I believe a set of strong trading first-quarter figures will be forthcoming on Thursday, May 2.
The household goods company saw its share price fall below £60 per share last week following news that charges of illegal marketing were being brought against its Indivior by the US, raising speculation that the Footsie firm could be facing hefty legal bills related to the heroin-treatment manufacturer which it spun off five years ago.
I would consider this to be a decent dip-buying opportunity for long-term investors, though, and particularly as those forthcoming trading details could well remind the market of its brilliant defensive qualities and the subsequent likelihood of solid and sustained earnings and dividend growth. It certainly did this when full-year results were unveiled back in February,
Now City analysts aren’t expecting earnings at Reckitt Benckiser to blow anyone away in the immediate future at least, a bottom-line increase of only 2% being predicted. What the calculator bashers do believe, though, is that provides the base for dividends to keep on improving as well -- a total annual reward of 176.6p per share is estimates, a target which yields a decent-ish 3%. An added bonus: this projection is covered two times over by predicted earnings.
Clearly larger yields can be found, but the ubiquity of its beloved products means that Reckitt Benckiser can be relied on to keep increasing profits and thus bumping dividends higher year after year, too. And this makes it a great selection for income investors, in my opinion.

The couple bought the land in 2002. Built around an expansive courtyard, their 13,574-square-foot home sits on an acre and includes five bedrooms, five full bathrooms and four partial bathrooms.
Nature takes the spotlight in The Reserve, where houses are spaced well apart. On a leisurely drive through the circular driveway with a porte-cochere, one can appreciate the enviable views of the sprawling landscape framed by the San Jacinto mountains.
“The entrance driveway is fascinating because you turn off of the main city street, and then you’re suddenly in a desert landscape,” says Philip. “It’s meant to feel like a place where your blood pressure comes down because you’re in a natural landscape. That’s the ambience.”
Outside the courtyard, desert plants abound, but within the confines of the courtyard, Geda says “you can plant pretty much what you want.” The couple's landscape includes lush citrus trees and other plants.

In the expansive courtyard, a charming fountain depicts a boy and girl pouring water. Wander in the backyard, and you’ll find a dancing fountain and a mesmerizing infinity-edged swimming pool. The edge of the pool is raised about 18 inches above the landscaped area.
“The only part that is not an infinity edge is where the hot tub is, which has a waterfall that flows down into the pool,” explains Philip. “On a quiet morning, the reflection in that pool is absolutely amazing. There’s no edge, so as you look out the window, the world is sort of reflected in the pool.” A fire pit adds style and comfort. James Butchart for Pacific Sotheby’s International Realty
The outdoor heaters and a fire pit are perfect for extending outdoor entertaining long after the sun goes down.
Large urns flanking the stately front entryway lend curb appeal. The home’s floor plan blurs the lines between indoors and out, thanks to pocket doors that slide into the walls. From every vantage point, one is guaranteed a splendid view.
“Everything is open, and for the events that we have done here, that worked extraordinarily well,” says Philip. The couple has held numerous events at this home, primarily fundraisers supporting not-for-profit organizations. The kitchen features a mosaic created by a Jordanian master.

James Butchart for Pacific Sotheby’s International Realty
The homeowners created an abode that’s a harmonious blend of Western and Middle Eastern influences, due in no small part to imported finishes from Geda’s homeland, Jordan. Along with limestone flooring that the Condits bought in Jordan, Dead Sea travertine is on display in the ceiling of the eat-in kitchen. Jordanian mosaics and stones create dramatic focal points throughout. For example, an impressive mosaic inspired by a winery in Italy is without a doubt the primary focal point of the kitchen.
The gourmet kitchen also features granite countertops, top-of-the-line appliances as well as a spacious butler’s pantry and a separate pass-through bar. A Jacuzzi is in a small garden area off the master bedroom. The home has a 1,500-bottle wine cellar. James Butchart for Pacific Sotheby’s International Realty The 26-seat movie theater has real theater chairs and a stage.

The lower level, which is accessible by elevator, includes a 1,500-bottle wine cellar and a game room that transports guests to yesteryear. The area is set up like a town square with an ice-cream parlor, English-style pub, apothecary, store, train station and movie theater with a stage.
The couple acquired 26 movie seats that lend an air of authenticity to the home cinema. “I think our peak was something like over 30 people in that room,” says Philip. “We had kids down on the floor in front, and a stage for kids to do what they wanted to do.”
A vintage street lamp post salvaged from the home of the late movie star Ginger Rogers melds perfectly with the town square theme. A Dale Chihuly chandelier lights up this space. James Butchart for Pacific Sotheby’s International Realty
The couple’s curated collection of furnishings includes a chandelier designed by world-renowned glass artist Dale Chihuly.
Rather than dividing their time between two homes, the Condits look forward to spending more time with family and friends at their primary residence in Frisco, Texas, where they put down roots in 2004.
“This home in The Reserve has a lot of our personality in it,” admits Philip. “It’s a place we love dearly, but there comes a time when you don’t need a great big house and it’s time to downsize.”

Conor McGregor Comments On Amazing UFC 236 Fight Between Max Holloway And Dustin Poirier,www.forbes.com,Trent Reinsmith,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2019/04/14/conor-mcgregor-comments-on-amazing-ufc-236-fight-between-max-holloway-and-dustin-poirier/,"Heading into last night's UFC 236, former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor seemed very interested in the headlining fight between two of his old adversaries, Max Holloway and Dustin Poirier. McGregor predicted that the fight would be a thriller and that Poirier would triumph by stoppage. He was correct on the former, but not on the latter.
In an exciting five-round contest, Poirier walked away from the unanimous decision winner. He might not have landed as many strikes as Holloway during the spirited scrap, but the blows he did land during the bout were more impactful. By the end of the fight, Holloway had a substantial cut between his bruised and swollen eyes.
After the bout, which took place at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, McGregor tweeted out his approval of not just the main event bout, but the equally exciting co-main event, where Israel Adesanya captured the interim middleweight title with a unanimous decision win over Kelvin Gastelum.
Amazing main event fights. How fighting should be!
Max you are insanely tough!
Please rest up now young Uce, you are a warrior head to toe!
A champion FOREVER.
Congratulations Dustin on a much deserved UFC title to your career.
It is Nate next for you like previously scheduled.

Holloway, moved up to lightweight in the first time in his UFC career to face Poirier at UFC 236. He is the current featherweight champion."
More Stores Have Closed So Far in 2019 Than In All Of 2018. So What.,www.forbes.com,Richard Kestenbaum,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2019/04/14/more-stores-have-closed-so-far-in-2019-than-in-all-of-2018-so-what/,"(Photographer: Justin Chin/Bloomberg) © 2018 Bloomberg Finance LP Last week, Coresight Research reported that U.S. store closings in 2019 to date have exceeded store closings in all of 2018. That’s major news—the growth or shrinkage of square feet available to sell consumer products has always had a direct correlation to the trajectory of retail sales. That’s always been a strong indicator of where the economy is going. The New York Times put the Coresight story on the front page of its business section.
I don’t care. The way that retail has changed in the last few years makes the number of square feet available to sell products less relevant than ever. While it’s true that the shrinkage in the number of stores means stores will sell less stuff, it isn’t necessarily a comment on the condition of the retail industry the way it used to be. In fact, retail sales have risen all through the demise of tens of thousands of retail stores in the last several years.
Stores have a different purpose now. Before the internet and mobile shopping, a store existed to hold stuff, and if you wanted to buy that stuff, you went to the store. But now that consumers can buy almost anything at any time or place, growth in store counts is an old metric that matters less.
The future of stores now depends on what you do with them. Aside from holding and selling products, stores now need to do more things: stimulate online sales, handle pickups and returns from online sales and even serve as warehouses or distribution points for products ordered online to facilitate fast delivery or pickup. They’re also a billboard, reminding people in a community of a brand’s existence and what’s new at the brand as they go by so consumers will keep the brand top of mind when they shop online. So many brands now see greater activity online in areas around their stores’ locations. In a process called “showrooming,” consumers also use the store not just to purchase but to research the products they buy online.
In the future, stores need to be less about just what happens in their own four walls. Instead of asking consumers to come in to buy something, stores need to show their products at events, in hotel lobbies, even in private homes. Wherever consumers go and are in a spending mood is where products need to be offered for sale. Stores need to move outside their own environments and engage consumers where they are; they can’t always insist on making consumers come to them. Retail now is more complicated and risky. It takes more skills and more capital, both human and financial, to succeed. Running stores isn’t as much about real estate as it used to be.
One group that is heavily impacted by the store closings, of course, is landlords. The hard fact is that a square foot of retail space is worth less now than it was 36 months ago almost everywhere in America. It has taken landlords some time to adapt to this, and their reluctance to lower the lease price per square foot is a reason there are still so many gap-toothed retail spaces all over the country.
As they eventually begin to loosen up by lowering the price per square foot, the question arises: What other functions can a store serve? If the price per square foot is lower, should stores be taking additional space that they can use for programs, speakers, demonstrations, classes and other events? If they do that, won’t that be a reason for consumers to come in and buy products, especially if the events are related to the products in the store? The possibilities are endless if retailers get creative about more than just their products. It is even possible that event spaces in retail stores can generate an additional revenue stream.
These are different skills than retailers have traditionally needed. For the last 25 years, retailers have focused on reducing risk in their business by slashing inventories, focusing on improving sales per square foot and taking on less risky merchandise. But now the business calls on them to change their state of mind and experiment to find the right solutions, even knowing that everything they try won’t work out. Retail is not set up to reward failure, but changing the reward system to acknowledge the development of new thinking is important for such a fast-changing business.
Because fewer sales are done in store and because what stores do is changing, the number of stores matters less than ever before. We need new metrics to measure the effectiveness of stores; just watching the number of stores go up or down no longer describes the health of the retail business. Brands that don’t adapt their stores to this environment will not just see their stores close; they will see their businesses diminish. But stores that adapt to the way the world works now can simultaneously have fewer stores and greater sales and profits because their stores can move into consumers’ minds. Creating new ways to measure performance will help stores think about how to have success in ways that works for how consumers live now.

Can A $1.5 Billion Bet On Fuel Cell Big Rigs Be A Game Changer For Hydrogen?,www.forbes.com,Alan Ohnsman,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2019/04/14/can-a-15-billion-bet-on-fuel-cell-big-rigs-be-a-game-changer-for-hydrogen/,"Hydrogen has been a promising but elusive vehicle fuel for half a century , powering a range of fuel cell cars and SUVs but never quite solving cost and efficiency snags and lack of fuel stations that make it less attractive than batteries for zero-emission vehicles. The problem isn’t the technology, argues the founder of Arizona startup Nikola Motor , but that big trucks are a much better choice for hydrogen. The 4-year-old maker of hydrogen tractor trailers is extolling a vision as brash as the one Tesla’s founders unveiled 13 years ago with its pricey all-electric cars: Nikola will act as a catalyst to bring hydrogen to the mainstream, building tens of thousands of hydrogen-powered big rigs and a coast-to-coast hydrogen station network to fuel them. It also wants carmakers like Toyota , General Motors, Honda , Hyundai and Daimler to use those stations to expand their hydrogen fuel cell vehicle sales beyond California.
It won’t be cheap: Nikola is seeking $1.25 billion to fund it, on top of $300 million raised so far, CEO Trevor Milton tells Forbes . He’ll make a big push this week with a Nikola-led hydrogen tech conference in Scottsdale, Arizona, convening suppliers, partners, potential investors, future customers and carmakers, to gin up excitement and win powerful allies.
Nikola CEO Trevor Milton at the unveiling of the company's Nikola One truck.
Nikola Motor “You can’t do this alone. Toyota and the others can’t do it on their own and neither could we,” he said. “The thing that Nikola brings to the table is we actually provide the entire network, we’re building 700 hydrogen stations around America. It will be the largest in the world.”
Milton is pushing trucks because it's easier to package the bulky tanks that hold compressed hydrogen gas on big trucks than cars, the technology's costs are easier to recoup on heavily used commercial vehicles than cars and refueling time and driving range are comparable to diesel trucks. He'll be competing with several companies readying battery trucks including Tesla–which has signed up Pepsi, Anheuser Busch, FedEx, Walmart as customers–as well as Daimler, BYD and startup Thor . But he sees a big advantage for Nikola's hydrogen fuel-cell system for long-distance highway runs of 500 miles or more: It's much lighter than Elon Musk's battery-powered Tesla Semi.
“Hydrogen works way better on heavy-duty (trucks), and we’re 5,000 pounds lighter than Tesla,” he said. “Look at Anheuser Busch. They ordered 40 or 50 trucks from them and 800 from us.” In fact, he claims Nikola has lined up $14 billion in truck leases from big shippers including Anheuser Busch and U.S. Express, each of which is a seven-year lease is worth about $1 million.
“We’re sold out for eight years of production,” said Milton, who worked for steel and metals powerhouse Worthington Industries and sold low-emission fuel systems for heavy-duty vehicles for German engineering firm DHybrid before founding Nikola.
But none of those orders turn into revenue until Nikola completes its fundraising push and gets into production, targeted for late 2022. Its fueling network, with stand-alone stations dispensing hydrogen extracted from water, using electricity produced by wind, solar and other renewable sources, will take much of the 2020s to set up. The next three years will be tough and require nonstop spending by the unproven startup. But its success would benefit companies that have been plugging away in hydrogen for years, improving the odds of getting industry support Milton seeks.
Nikola intends to build 700 fuel stations across the U.S. over the next decade, making zero-emission hydrogen from water using electricity from renewable energy.
Nikola Motor Sales of electric cars are growing worldwide as batteries and component costs improve, led by Tesla, and increasing numbers of medium- and heavy-duty electric trucks and buses can be found on the streets of big cities and at ports. But the physics of long-range semis, hauling up to 80,000 pounds including the cab and trailer, mean the winning technology is still a wildcard.
“If you want to electrify heavy-duty trucks, a Class-8 truck needs seven tons or 700-kilowatt hours of battery in there, that makes four to five packs to store in the truck. By comparison, you get the same range from a few hundred kilograms of hydrogen,” said Bernd Heid, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company, who researches trucking industry trends and technology.
Similarly, batteries require vastly more recharge time than either hydrogen or for conventional diesel fuel. With diesel, every minute of fueling provides 20 miles of range for a big truck, while with hydrogen, a minute of fueling provides 12 miles of range, Heid calculates. For a battery-powered truck, each minute of charging only provides 3 miles, he said. So for a truck to go 500 miles, it takes about 25 minutes for a diesel, 42 minutes for hydrogen and potentially more than two and a half hours for a battery truck. (Musk has said Tesla will have a network of “Megachargers” that provide 400 miles range in 30 minutes for its futuristic Semi , with its battery packs plugged into individual chargers to simultaneously repower them.)
“Trucking is a business that is ideally operating 24-seven,” Heid said. “Every minute or hour that you have downtime not operating, it doesn't make money. The filling or charging time is a huge business impact.”
Fuel-cell and battery-powered vehicles are both electric, sharing the same motors and many other components. The key difference is that batteries store electricity and fuel cells produce it onboard as needed, in an electrochemical process that extracts electrons from hydrogen forced through fuel-cell membranes. Aside from the electricity, the only byproduct is water vapor, rather than harmful diesel exhaust. Beyond cars and trucks, they’ve been used by NASA for decades , they work as stationary electricity generators and are being developed to power trains and even ships and ferries .
For battery cars, it’s relatively simple to create public charging infrastructure to allow drivers to power up when parked, but even a fast charge can take 30 minutes or more. Fuel-cell cars can be refueled in about the same amount of time as those using gasoline, though the number of public stations dispensing compressed hydrogen gas in California, which has the most, is just 37 currently, clustered in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Orange County and down to San Diego . Dozens more are planned, but like the extensive Supercharger network Musk has built up for Tesla owners, Nikola’s 700-station goal would be a game-changer for cross-country travel.
“If there’s suddenly this expansion of hydrogen infrastructure across the U.S., it’s a big deal,” said Craig Scott, national manager for Toyota’s U.S. advanced technologies group. “It would be a very good thing to have more hydrogen stations opening up–more is more.”
Toyota has sold Mirai hydrogen sedans in California and Japan for the past few years, and operates two fuel-cell trucks at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, with more on the way . It’s even building a hydrogen plant at the ports, making the fuel from waste material, to power its fleet.
The Nikola Tre will be offered with a choice of either a hydrogen system or batteries for shorter-range hauling.
Nikola Motor Milton will elaborate this week on a strategy that will take the better part of a decade to realize. It includes prepping a 500-acre site for its plant outside of Phoenix, with plans to break ground early next year. It’s designed to eventually crank out up to 50,000 semi-trucks a year, a massive amount of production capacity in the world of big rigs. Nikola has also unveiled three different models, including the long-range Nikola One, with a sleeper cab, the Nikola Two for shorter uses, and the Nikola Tre, which will be offered with a choice of hydrogen system or batteries for shorter-range hauling.
“About 90% of all the orders that come in are coming in hydrogen, the other 10% are for electric,” Milton said. “The nice thing about Nikola is we're the only company that can say, yeah, we offer both and we’ll shoot it to you straight–based on your needs.”
Separately, Nikola filed suit against Tesla in federal court in Arizona last year claiming the design for its Semi unveiled in November 2017 was far too close to the Nikola One, which had its public debut more than a year earlier. Tesla tried to have the suit dismissed, but the litigation continues and may not be resolved until 2020.
There’s no question that Nikola’s aspirations may exceed its abilities, but it will take years to know for sure.
In 2006, when Musk and Tesla’s original management team laid out a quixotic vision to transform the auto industry with a new generation of electric cars, few at the company’s public debut in Santa Monica, California, thought success was in the cards. Thirteen years later Musk’s mission isn’t complete, but Tesla has achieved far more than expected and pushed auto rivals to go electric.
If Milton achieves half as much for hydrogen, while automakers keep building up their fuel-cell offerings as hydrogen finds its way into new applications, the impact would be dramatic.

A Geological Study Of The Titanic Shipwreck Site,www.forbes.com,David Bressan,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbressan/2019/04/14/a-geological-study-of-the-titanic-shipwreck-site/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Science I deal with the rocky road to our modern understanding of earth Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin During its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York, just before midnight on April 14, 1912, the Titanic struck an iceberg, sinking three hours later with still 1,500 passengers on board. Photo credit: Getty Getty After the R.M.S. Titanic struck an iceberg on Sunday, 14 April 1912, its further fate remained a mystery for over seventy years. At the time survivor testimonies claiming that the ship broke in half were dismissed as inaccurate. When the wreck was discovered in September 1985 almost 370 miles south-southeast off the coast of Newfoundland, it was indeed confirmed that the ship broke into two large pieces and into many smaller pieces creating a debris field approximately 15 square miles in size. The ship's bow is still mostly intact, even if most structures on deck collapsed when the sinking Titanic hit the seafloor. The ship's stern was crushed by the impact and water pressure. A large debris field, with hundreds of thousands of items, from machinery to personal items of the passengers, is scattered between the two parts of the ship.
The remains of Titanic rest at the end of Cameron Canyon (named not after the famous filmmaker James, but after Canadian scientific researcher Harky Cameron) descending from the Newfoundland Ridge to an abyssal plain about 2.5 miles below the ocean surface. The canyon floor is covered by sediment debris and slumps transitioning into the Titanic Sediment Wave Field, a large muddy plain, characterized by dunes, sand ribbons and sheets, formed by strong underwater currents moving through the area. These currents are probably also the reason why the debris from the sinking ship is scattered over such a large area.
Five years in the making, Titanic sank in less than three hours and will probably not last until the end of this century. Apart from the damage done by the sinking, also time is consuming the Titanic. According to some research, the wreckage will eventually be buried in about fifty years by sediments. Also, microorganisms living in the deep sea contribute to the wreck's decay. During the first visit of the wreck with a submarine in 1986, researchers discovered that various bacteria and fungi colonized the wreck . One type of bacteria was even an unknown species, appropriately named Halomonos titanicae in 2010. The microorganisms produce energy to sustain their metabolism by oxidizing the iron parts of the ship. The microbial metabolism forms a thick layer of rust covering the entire wreck, forming even stalactites (called rusticles ) on windows and fissures of the hull. Every day the microorganisms consume almost 100 pounds of iron. The upper ship's decks are made from thin steel plates and will probably last for another ten to fifteen years. The ship's hull is made of thick plates, and even if not strong enough to resist the iceberg that fateful night, the steel will resist for some decades on the bottom of the ocean. However, in the end, the weakened hull will collapse completely and be buried by sediments, transported by the currents.
During an expedition in 2004, Robert Ballard, one of the oceanographers who found the wreck , noted some signs of our modern civilization scattered around the wreck. In the debris field, he found plastic cups from passing ships and iron chains or ballast bags of submarines visiting the site. The visitors also damaged the wreck, especially the area around the famous staircase . By landing on the ship's decks, the heavy vehicles used to visit the wreck damage the still intact steel, the fissures are quickly colonized by the corrosive microorganisms. Yellow stains of decomposing iron document this process on the upper decks and the bow. Also, human activity on the sea surface has impacts on the Titanic. Unsustainable fishing along the Grand Banks of Newfoundland has significantly reduced the local fish population in the last decades. A smaller population consumes less plankton in the upper layers of the ocean and more organic matter sinks to the bottom of the sea. Here, the surplus of nutrients causes a bloom in the microbial deep-sea community covering the wreck. As the microbes multiply and feed on the wreck, it will accelerate the slow, but incessant, decay of the Titanic.
Even if the wreck will eventually completely disappear, some traces of the disaster will still be there on the bottom of the sea. In 1991 Cameron Canyon was formally renamed to Titanic Canyon. Also, a number of nearby seamounts were named after the vessels involved in the disaster. For example, Carpathia honors the first ship to arrive at the site of the disaster in 1912 and saving 743 surviving passengers.

Send Job Stress Packing And Reboot Your Work Health,www.forbes.com,Bryan Robinson,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2019/04/14/send-job-stress-packing-and-reboot-your-work-health/,"Job stress has become a worldwide problem. A Gallup Poll reported that 80% of American workers suffer some type of stress on the job. And half say they need help learning how to manage it. Some work stress is normal, but extreme or chronic pressures can leave you with a whiplash, harming your health and interfering with your ability to function. Studies show that chronic work stress can be just as bad for your mental and physical well-being as smoking or lack of exercise. Prolonged job stress keeps defenses on high alert and raises your risk of high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, chronic pain and a lowered immune system. Identify Your Job Stressors
It’s usually not your entire job that causes stress but one or two aspects of it. A CareerBuilder survey reported that 45% of American workers complain that their workload is too heavy. A Korn Ferry survey revealed that two-thirds of 2,000 professionals said their job stress levels are higher today than five years ago. The largest source of that stress? Bosses. A global survey by World Business showed that nearly one-half (49%) of workers said their company encourages overwork. Another study found that highly effective managers work fewer hours (an average of 52 hours a week), compared to less productive managers who work longer hours (an average 70 hours a week). Managers who work the longer hours suffer greater anxiety, depression, burnout and twice the number of health-related problems than managers putting in fewer hours.
According to British researchers, long workweeks in high-pressured jobs contribute to risk of heart attack. Employees who put in more than eleven hours a day were 67% more likely to have a heart attack, compared to those who put in fewer hours. Employees working double or triple duty to offset budget cuts were the most likely to be plagued by stress-induced headaches, muscle pain, metabolic disorders and fatigue outside the workplace. Studies also show that a noisy workplace causes stress hormones to rise to unhealthy levels—a condition that constricts coronary arteries and reduces blood supply to the heart. People exposed to chronic loud noise on the job are twice as likely to have heart disease and heart attacks as those who toil in quieter places. Work style also can contribute to job stress. If you’re attracted to a high-stress career, you’re more likely to pressure yourself with unrealistic job demands, fail to monitor work habits, skip lunch breaks or eat your desk and allow your career to trump other aspects of your life.
Devise A Work Health Plan
What about you? What is your biggest job stressor and what can you do about it? Chances are you’re not aware that your stress response is on high alert when you’re working. Perhaps you get swept up in your commitments and don’t realize the toll—both mental and physical—job stress can take on you. You can’t fire your boss or take over the company and restructure it, but you can be a better stress manager. Here are some tips to reboot your health when you feel like job pressures are crashing down upon you:
1. Be proactive with self-care. Make sure you realize you’ve hit your breaking point long before stress-warning signs set in. Instead of pushing past them, cushion your workday to soften stress blows. Avoid putting yourself under unrealistic deadlines. Replace “deadlines” with “lifelines.” Take “health days” in addition to “sick days.” Spread job tasks over reasonable time frames. Build time cushions between meetings. Try leaving for work 10 or 15 minutes earlier so you won’t start your day in a hurry. Ease into your workday instead of catapulting into it. Unplug at the end of the day and set boundaries to protect your personal and private time.
2. Avoid multitasking. Studies show that multitasking isn’t what it’s cracked up to be and in fact that it takes longer to go from one task to the next because of the added time to refresh your memory of each task. Workers who focus on one task at a time are more efficient, productive and effective at work/life harmony.
3. Stay grounded and come up for air. Be mindful of your surroundings. Pay attention to what’s around you and bring your attention into the present moment to reduce stress and generate more performance energy in a demanding job. Take off your socks and shoes and feel your toes against the floor. Pay close attention to how the floor feels against your feet. If you have an opened window, focus your senses on nature: sounds of chirping birds, fragrance of blooming flowers, or sight of squirrels in the trees. Take 60 seconds to identify the sounds around you (traffic in the background, voices off in the distance, the gurgling of your stomach) then notice your heart rate slow, your muscles loosen and your mind clear.
4. Change your scenery. Getting outside even if it’s only for 10 or 15 minutes, not only gives your fatigued mind a break, it also boosts your mood. Dine away from your desk or take a walk around the block or in a park before returning to work.
5. Give your workstation a makeover. A disorganized or sloppy work area can raise stress. Does your desk look like a tsunami struck? If so a tidy work space can reduce stress and establish feelings of calm and control.
6. Dial back on overtime. To cut your health risks, reduce overtime work when possible. Toil by the adage of working smarter, not longer.
7. Meditate. Meditating or contemplating at your desk for just five minutes is restorative. It helps you unwind, clear your head, and refresh your mind, body and spirit.
8. Stay fit outside the office. Think of your work site as the Olympics. Your physical and mental endurance at work hinges on being in good shape.

Why Jane Jacobs Still Leads In Urbanism,www.forbes.com,Deborah Talbot,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahtalbot/2019/04/14/why-jane-jacobs-still-leads-in-urbanism/,"There is no shortage of books and articles written about Jane Jacobs, author of the seminal book The Death and Life of Great American Cities . There is no shortage of critics either. The centennial of her birth–4 th May 2016–saw another re-examination (and criticism) of her contribution to urbanism. But as Peter Laurence, author of Becoming Jane Jacobs pointed out , many discussions about Jacobs present her ideas as a static model–theories set in aspic. “There are many good ways to celebrate and criticize Jane Jacobs,” he said. “Cartoons and slogans aren’t the best ways—unless perhaps these include ‘More Jacobs, fewer slogans’ or ‘Fewer slogans, more questions.’”
Laurence rightly argued that, if one wanted to respect her contribution to the field of urbanism, we would take her ideas and ask more questions for the society in which we live today. These questions might include how to manage gentrification or alleviate racial and economic segregation, issues which Jacobs touched on but which get to the core of how we can create a just and democratic city. And as we know, justice and democracy were at the heart of what she stood for.
Yet for all that has been written, and for all that our society is very different to the one she analyzed and wrote about, it sometimes feels as though we are still at the starting line–working around the same issues and having to fight the same battles that she fought.
In March 2019, I published a book on Jane Jacobs , part of a series on great thinkers being planned by the independent publishing house Bowden and Brazil. Writing the book, it struck me how little of Jacobs’ work had actually been digested and applied–regardless of her status-and how much of what she wrote is relevant to our current dilemmas.
I want to offer two examples of her ideas and how they shed light on some of the most pressing global issues we face.
The economic geography of growth and innovation
Jacobs’ writings on economics were somewhat derided compared to Death and Life . But I'd argue that her economics and urbanism were intrinsically related and that her ideas and concepts have enormous relevance for today.
Take the idea of diversity. Diversity for Jacobs meant the importance of mixed-use neighborhoods–places where living, working, entertainment and consumption coexisted. She was very much against zoning the different aspects of our lives. Diversity also meant social diversity–the social mixing of genders, ethnicities, classes and nationalities.
Diversity not only produces lively neighborhoods, it is also essential for economic innovation and growth. Mixed-use neighborhoods provide a steady stream of customers for businesses. Neighborhoods with lots of places to go and different access and exit points has the maximum possibilities for social encounters. And in those social encounters, people exchange ideas-essential for new business and new initiatives.
Social diversity means that people with different ideas and innovations set up businesses, often in neglected areas.
“Right now,” she said in a lecture in 2000, “newcomers are enlivening dull and dreary shops with tiny grocery and clothing stores, second-hand shops, little importing and craft enterprises, skimpy offices and modest but exotic restaurants.”
Or take her concept of density-the idea that human settlements should build homes close together, permitting more people to live per square mile. Density-more people in one place-means more chance for productive social encounters and, should you set up a shop or café, more customers to sustain you over the long-term.
Cities-particularly places like London and New York-are where we see these vital ingredients for economic success. And in recent years, understanding why cities are outperforming the suburbs and rural areas is also central to understand the attacks on our Polis. Sixty per cent of Gross Added Value (GAV) in the UK is generated by cities. In the US, some have assessed that 85% of GDP is created by cities.
The governmental neglect of places on the margins has fueled enormous resentment against the more prosperous cities. Yet if we could understand and popularize why cities do better, we could also help the geographical margins.
Democracy, trust and countering klepto-populism
The democratic deficit has a strong relationship to economic fortune. Jane Jacobs was a fierce democrat, arguing that planning should be bottom-up, not top-down. Rather than planners and politicians making decisions about our neighborhoods for us, Jacobs argued that people know best what works in the areas in which they live.
The democratic deficit can mean many things. It is embedded in the suspicion of cities engendered by the culture wars pervading the US and now the UK. It shows in the continuing construction of large corporate skyscrapers against the wishes of residents and the psychogeographical feel of an area.
It is demonstrated in the imposition of new towns and garden cities in the UK and the corresponding weakening of the power of residents to object. It reveals itself in the gentrification of neighborhoods, displacing middle-income residents.
The democratic deficit is also felt the absence of diversity in decision-making, something of which Jacobs was all too aware. ‘Urban planning has a sexism problem,’ said Katrina Johnston Zimmerman in Next City.
Recent statistics show that, in the UK, the number of women in architecture fell from 28% to 21% between 2009 and 2011. And more anecdotally, men dominate urbanist writing in the UK and elsewhere, their voices amplified in social media.
A survey of Planetizen readers asked them to identify who were the 100 most influential urbanists. Only 10% of these were women, and none were outside the US. Diversity is all too absent from the way our cities are designed.
Jacobs makes a compelling case for trust–that, given enough say, people will make responsible choices. As more people feel disenfranchised, leading them to take down their flawed democratic leaders in protest votes that favour autocratic TV personalities, her ideas have never been more prescient.
Finding ways to renew civil society and connect the people to the Polis, beginning with the neighborhoods they inhabit, and finding ways to express the positive impact of diversity for everyone, could be a vital way forward.
The sociology of the city is economic development
The point I want to end with is that, what Jane Jacobs showed us was that to understand the social structures of the city is to understand the economy. She was writing at a time of top-down national plans that shaped economic planning, so it is not surprising that her ideas were taken as a sociological commentary of the city rather than a new economic theory.
As nation-states have become weakened and the gap between cities and the rest become stark, it is worth taking another look at the more splintered, localized form of economics she theorized. It might just help us to think about some of our big questions of marginalization and inequality driving us to the cliff edge."

Sony Is Reportedly Reason 'Destiny 2' Can't Have Character Transfer Or Cross-Save,www.forbes.com,Paul Tassi,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/04/14/sony-is-reportedly-the-reason-destiny-2-cant-have-character-transfer-or-cross-save/,"Destiny players are already not terribly huge fans of Sony’s, thanks in part to a five-year-running exclusivity deal that restricts content for Xbox and PC players and makes that restricted content worse for even its own players (no Xur sales, no Nightfalls, etc. for exclusives). But now there’s fresh information that Sony might be standing in the way of the one thing Destiny players have been asking for the last few years. Destiny oracle Jason Schreier mentioned this on the Kotaku Splitscreen podcast this week , that in his conversations with Bungie employees, they indicated that yes, they wanted to do character transfers across PC, Xbox and PlayStation versions of the game, but Sony was the one to step in and veto the notion.
It stands to reason that this is also why we cannot get cross-save and cross-progression, as in your PS4 progress carries over to PC and vice-versa, given that it’s an extremely similar concept and Sony would no doubt object to that as well.
Sony has previously been fingered as the culprit for why many other Switch/Xbox/PC games couldn’t have full cross-play/cross-save with PS4, and it took an entire army of Fortnite fans and direct pressure from Epic to finally get Sony to bend on PS4 cross-play for that game.
Destiny 2
Bungie Players are now wondering why Bungie doesn’t just do the same to Sony, allow character transfer and cross-progression between Xbox and PC, and let the pressure build on Sony from the community.
Of course, as I’ve mentioned, Bungie’s relationship with Sony is complicated. This ongoing deal exists, which means PlayStation has paid Activision and/or Bungie a bunch of money for these exclusive items, and it also means that Sony is the one doing a lot of promotion for Destiny in ads, stage time at E3, or console bundles. They can’t exactly just start throwing sand in their face.
It is currently unclear whether the Sony relationship with Bungie will continue in the wake of the split from Activision, but Bungie needs more promotion and money than ever, now that they don’t have corporate backing, so it may very well be the case that Bungie continues this deal for as long as Sony wants it. The fact that the deal exists at all is itself an impediment to cross-play or cross-save, given that you run into awkward situations like say, Sony exclusive weapons or armor in your loadout being disabled when you boot up your PS4 character on PC.
Sony’s forward-facing rationale for being a stick in the mud on the issue is that they don’t “trust” other platforms to give PS players the experience they’ve come to know from Sony and PSN. In reality, it is now doubt because Sony has a massive platform sales advantage this console generation, and they have the power of the snowball effect where if all your friends have Destiny on PlayStation, when you’re thinking about getting a new console, you will pick up a PlayStation to play with them. Nintendo, being Nintendo, doesn’t care about this at all, and Microsoft, perhaps somewhat more cynically, is taking the “everybody should just be friends approach” largely because it has to since it massively lost this generation in terms of sales and they can only gain from this arrangement. Roles could easily be reversed in this situation, but they are not, and so Sony remains the bad guy. As they should be.
Destiny 2
Bungie I have been dying to play Destiny on PC ever since Destiny 2 arrived there, and while I did one playthrough of vanilla with one character, it is literally impossible to split time between the platforms. I can barely manage three characters on console, no way can I add a fourth, fifth or sixth on PC, keeping up with new content, which is why I simply don’t play there even though I’d love to jump on it from time to time, or even switch it to my main. But without character transfer or cross-save, no way in hell can I give up 800 hours on console.
Like everything with the Sony/Bungie relationship, this sucks. Given that Sony has been known to break with enough pressure, I don’t want to say it’s impossible for this to happen someday, but Bungie is not Epic and the Destiny fanbase is not 200 million Fortnite players, so it’s a bit of a different situation. Still, yuck.

China's Second-Richest Man Wades Into Controversy Over Tech Sector's Work Culture,www.forbes.com,Tracy Qu,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracyqu/2019/04/14/chinas-second-richest-man-wades-into-controversy-over-tech-sectors-work-culture/,"Alibaba’s billionaire founder Jack Ma has expressed his support for working long hours to achieve success in China’s tech industry, but his comments sparked a backlash from many users on the country’s social media platforms. Ma brought up the industry’s controversial 996 schedule, which refers to working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week, during a speech to Alibaba’s employees.
“I think it is a huge blessing that we can work 996,” Ma said, according to a post on Alibaba’s WeChat account .
Ma told Alibaba’s employees that they should be willing to pay the price for choosing to join ""China’s top-ranked"" company. “If you want to work for Alibaba, you should be prepared to work 12 hours per day,” he said, while pointing out that he and other early employees of the e-commerce company also had to work long hours.
A former English teacher who cofounded Alibaba in 1999, Ma is currently China’s second-wealthiest person with a net worth estimated at $40.1 billion. The country's richest person, Ma Huateng , also happens to have built his success in the tech sector as the cofounder of Tencent. ""Pony Ma,"" as he's known, has a fortune estimated at $43.8 billion.
""Any company should not, and cannot, force employees to keep a 996 work schedule,"" Jack Ma wrote in a follow-up post on his own personal Weibo account on Friday. ""Alibaba has always advocated, living your life with gusto and being happy at work. But young people, themselves, must understand that happiness is a struggle! Not defending 996, but do pay tribute to the fighters!""
Alibaba was unable to reply to a request for comment on Ma’s remarks. The speech has been widely shared in China’s microblogging platform Weibo, where Ma received over 36,000 comments on his 996 post .
“It’s okay that we work 996, even ‘9107’ is acceptable. But you should pay more for employees to do so. Salary is the problem,” wrote one commenter to Alibaba's Weibo post . “Don’t discuss dreams with your employees who have just barely enough to eat and wear.”
On China’s popular Quora-like website Zhihu, one of the most prominent answers stated that Ma’s speech is “shifting the meaning” by making overwork about personal growth even though it is inconsistent with the labor law.
At the end of March, some tech workers launched an online project on Microsoft’s code-sharing site Github to protest against China’s overwork culture and seek a better work-life balance. The project has been dubbed “996.ICU,” in reference to the fact the workers following the 996 work schedule are at risk of ending up in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)."

Amazon now owns energy drink under the Solimo brand but that's not the only thing buzzing this week from your favourite cardboard abuser, Amazon admitted executives listen to customers Alexa calls to improve the service. Privacy advocates were annoyed, consumers were less so based on a review of the coverage and Twitter. Bloomberg has the story;
Sometimes they hear recordings they find upsetting, or possibly criminal. Two of the workers said they picked up what they believe was a sexual assault. When something like that happens, they may share the experience in the internal chat room as a way of relieving stress. Amazon says it has procedures in place for workers to follow when they hear something distressing, but two Romania-based employees said that, after requesting guidance for such cases, they were told it wasn’t Amazon’s job to interfere.
“We take the security and privacy of our customers’ personal information seriously,” an Amazon spokesman said in an emailed statement. “We only annotate an extremely small sample of Alexa voice recordings in order [to] improve the customer experience. For example, this information helps us train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems, so Alexa can better understand your requests, and ensure the service works well for everyone.
Amazon Go stores will accept cash per Amazon's Worldwide Digital Media SVP, Steve Kessel, who is looking to avoid any finger-pointing and discrimination claims which will likely dent the speedy impact Amazon wants these stores to have. Previously Amazon was adamant about no other options which is an indication about how seriously the company is taking Amazon Go;
In an internal all-hands meeting last month, Steve Kessel, Amazon’s senior vice president of physical stores, told employees that the company plans “additional payment mechanisms” at its Go stores. Kessel was responding to a question about how Amazon plans to address “discrimination and elitism” at the cashierless stores, which charge purchases using an app connected to a bank or credit card.
Kessel highlighted some of the new payment methods Amazon has recently added to its site, including a pilot that accepts government subsidized SNAP benefits and a new program called Amazon Cash, which lets users add cash to their digital accounts by bringing money to a local store like 7-Eleven or CVS.
CNBC has the story.
Amidst Amazon Air strike threats and 'porch pirate' arrests , Amazon may have trouble on its hand with brand perceptions if The Grocer 's report on UK consumers thoughts and feelings towards their various brands is to be believed;
Although Amazon is a relatively new entrant to UK grocery, shopper perceptions of its grocery credentials are generally positive. In our research, 80% of shoppers mentioned the company’s delivery capabilities and 77% agreed that Amazon is trustworthy.
However, shoppers did signal some confusion about how Amazon delivers groceries. Comments like ‘I worry about how clean the vans will be’ or ‘Would my groceries be delivered in a car?’ were typical.
Shoppers also expressed negative sentiment about freshness (mentioned by 46%) and the company’s ethics (33%), with comments such as ’I object to how Amazon treats its workers’.
