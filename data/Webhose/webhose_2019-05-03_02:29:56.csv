Here are the fundraising numbers for each of the top Democratic candidates in the first quarter. For those who haven’t announced their totals, I’ve guessed—making the assumption that their numbers are probably a little disappointing if they’re holding back.
Obviously my guesses might be wrong, so don’t take them seriously.
And while we’re on the topic, can I remind everyone that Pete Buttigieg didn’t just pop up out of nowhere? He’s been getting loads of press as an up-and-comer for at least the past five years (for example: “The most interesting mayor you’ve never heard of” in the Washington Post in 2014, “The first gay president?” in the New York Times in 2016). In 2017 he ran for DNC chair. He’s been talked about as a presidential candidate and representative of Millennials ever since.
In other words, it’s not a huge surprise that he’s gotten good press and raised a fair sum of money. He’s been courting the media for a long time, and he’s hardly an unknown in Democratic circles. FACT:

U.S. Sanctions on Russia: Congress Should Go Back to Fundamentals,carnegieendowment.org,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/03/u.s.-sanctions-on-russia-congress-should-go-back-to-fundamentals-pub-78755,"@AndrewSWeiss
Economic conditions stabilized rather quickly in 2016 amid a recovery in oil prices, and Russia returned to modest growth in 2017–2018. The economy benefited from a textbook policy response that stressed exchange rate flexibility, generous support for the banking system including the provision of emergency liquidity, and the selective use of fiscal stimulus. Ruble weakness, which was routinely touted by Western observers as a sign of the effectiveness of Western sanctions, turned out to be one of the Russian regime’s most effective tools.
Most of the pain of the adjustment, by design, was borne by Russian consumers, not the key pillars of the regime targeted by Western sanctions. Even though Western officials have been at pains to suggest that the program was not designed to hurt average citizens, they were hit hard by the devaluation of the ruble and the Kremlin’s counter-sanctions against Western food imports. The Kremlin cynically exploited the latter move and created confusion among the general public. (Opinion polls suggest that most Russians believe that the food sanctions were imposed by the West, not their own government.) Either way, the sanctions regime gave the Kremlin a ready-made explanation for poor economic performance as well as a rationale for import substitution policies, whose benefits accrued disproportionately to regime insiders.
To be sure, Western sanctions have caused lasting negative damage to Russia’s attractiveness to foreign investors and significantly constrained access to foreign capital for Russian firms. Persistent uncertainty about the outlook for Western sanctions and expanded state control over the economy throttled most sources of foreign investment. State-backed funding mechanisms and financial institutions have been able to take up some of the slack, increasing the dependence of well-connected business figures on the Kremlin and the state budget. The long-term effects on the lack of Western investment in unconventional oil exploration are yet to play out. The Russian private sector largely was forced to deleverage from Western sources of funding, which, somewhat paradoxically, led to substantial improvements in their balance sheets .
In the meantime, the Russian government has focused intently on rebuilding its defenses and limiting vulnerabilities to future shocks and sanctions. Russian oil production reached back-to-back record highs in 2017 and 2018, enabling the government to replenish its currency reserves, which now total roughly a half-trillion dollars and are back at pre–Ukraine crisis levels. The government is also successfully implementing a fiscal belt-tightening rule that earmarks a significant share of oil export earnings to national wealth funds.
The weak ruble provided a sizable boost to the Russian export sector as well as government efforts to eliminate its budget deficit. The 2018 Russian state budget ran a healthy surplus (2 percent) for the first time since 2011, thanks in part to a government-led austerity campaign. The profitability of Russian corporates, especially commodity exporters, soared, owing to the drop in ruble-denominated costs of production and operations. Ties to China, now the top foreign purchaser of Russian oil, expanded steadily in multiple realms.
The 2014 sanctions were based in part on a Western belief that, by putting pressure on the Russian economy and certain elites, important figures in the regime would then turn to Putin and ask for a change in course. Unfortunately, Russian elites are not equal in terms of access and influence. The most important ones are often the hardest to target with sanctions (in part because they have the fewest personal and financial connections to the West) and the ones Putin is best positioned to shield.
This state of affairs contains critical lessons for the future application of sanctions or other coercive tools of economic statecraft: it is not enough to create sanctions policy based on a theory about the macroeconomic effect of the proposed measure; it must also be based on a clear theory of the measure’s political economy effect.
The impact of the sanctions program on the Ukraine crisis is perhaps easier to identify. The threat of additional Western sanctions may have helped, at least on the margins, to deter further Russian aggression, ushering in a stalemate that has given the post-Maidan government in Kyiv valuable breathing room. As former U.S. sanctions coordinator Daniel Fried put it, “Had we done nothing, Russia might well have attempted to do still worse, such as trying to seize the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, pushing further west to create a land-bridge to Crimea, or opening new fronts in Ukraine.” Still, provocative Russian moves in the Sea of Azov in late 2018 have demonstrated that Moscow remains prepared to use hard-edged military tactics to throw the Ukrainians off-balance and test Western resolve.
Unfortunately, there is little evidence that the sanctions program has significantly altered the Kremlin’s risk appetite for activity beyond Ukraine. Indeed, since 2015 the Kremlin has mounted a broad-ranging global campaign of malign activities. These efforts include election meddling and cyber and information operations aimed at democratic processes in the United States, France, and other Western countries; an abortive coup attempt in Montenegro led by Russia’s military intelligence service, the GRU; offensive cyber activities, including the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack and thwarted operations against the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the World Anti-Doping Agency; a deadly confrontation near a U.S. special forces outpost in Syria in February 2018 involving Russian military contractors; a March 2018 attack on a former Soviet intelligence officer in the United Kingdom using a military-grade nerve agent; and covert attempts to interfere with the resolution of the long-running Greece-Macedonia name dispute. All the while, the Kremlin has also backed populist nationalist groups in several Western countries and pumped out vast quantities of disinformation via its sprawling propaganda apparatus. Challenges to U.S.-EU Unity
Since 2014, U.S.-EU unity on sanctions has generally exceeded expectations. While some critics complain that Obama’s focus on preserving unity with the Europeans limited the depth and breadth of the sanctions regime, U.S. and EU officials wisely understood that more could be gained by coordinating efforts than by pursuing independent policy preferences. U.S.-EU cooperation withstood traditional Kremlin efforts to drive wedges, thwarted sanctions evasion on a major scale, and reinforced efforts on the diplomatic track to de-escalate the Ukraine crisis. From the very beginning of the crisis, Washington was sensitive to the realities imposed by the EU’s geographical proximity and sizable trade and financial links with Russia. (At its peak in 2012, EU-Russia trade amounted to €339 billion, more than ten times the trade between Russia and the United States .)
Nevertheless, technical gaps persist between the U.S. and EU approaches to sanctions. As Harrell has recounted, EU officials have been, for example, wary of legal challenges to freezes on the assets of companies and individuals. To avoid damaging legal reversals, the EU, by necessity, focused on targeting companies and individuals based on unclassified evidence that could be mustered in court or by virtue of targeted entities’ legal status, such as being state-owned. Likewise, U.S. and EU sanctions experts have tried to manage significant differences between U.S. and EU standards on issues such as ownership and control, which might be exploited in legal challenges. Given worries at the time about possible financial contagion amid brewing crises in Greece and elsewhere in the eurozone, officials have also opted not to impose blocking sanctions on large Russian financial institutions and various types of financial instruments and derivatives.
Every six months, usually with little fanfare or drama, EU leaders have routinely renewed the sanctions program. These decisions—and the consensus they require—have been helped by Moscow’s continued failure to implement the Minsk accords and by poorly timed Russian misdeeds, such as the November 2018 naval confrontation in the Kerch Strait. Germany has played a central role in stiffening European resolve, reminding Italy, Hungary, Greece, and Cyprus that blocking consensus on sanctions renewal would have major negative repercussions in other areas of their cooperation with Brussels. At the same time, EU member states and Asian governments have not been shy about protecting commercially lucrative cooperation with Russia. For example, U.S. energy firms are understandably frustrated that they were forced to abandon unconventional energy projects in Russia, while similar or nearly identical efforts involving European firms were grandfathered by EU member states. Similar protections were instituted for European financial institutions for certain types of transactions.
To some extent, these gaps are the inevitable result of different regulatory structures in Washington and Brussels and the gap between member state- and EU-level policymaking authorities. These issues have proven manageable but cannot be closed in full. They can be widened, though, and are likely to become more challenging as the U.S. sanctions regime becomes increasingly unilateral in nature. The situation is further complicated by the schizophrenic nature of U.S. sanctions policy in the first years of the Trump administration, as Congress and the president wrestle for control.
With CAATSA, the U.S. Congress has widened the gap between the United States and Europe on how to manage Russia’s malign activities and has doubled down on the theory that costs imposed on regime insiders and Kremlin-linked wealthy individuals will result in pressure from within to prompt the Kremlin to change its policy. The Trump administration has appeared to be, at best, of two minds on this theory. It met the CAATSA requirement to issue a report listing senior government officials and wealthy oligarchs by January 2018 with a comically ill-informed and unclassified list that was cut and pasted from the 2017 Forbes ranking of Russia’s 200 wealthiest businessmen. In general, the EU does not share this approach, preferring to focus on sanctions against people or entities involved in undermining Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence, or other malign Russian activities.
Despite the hastily published list of oligarchs, the administration did eventually target specific Kremlin-linked individuals and firms with severe sanctions. Of these, the most important was Deripaska and his vast empire that includes aluminum giant Rusal and its parent company, En+. These designations were significant and were made without meaningful prior consultation with European partners and, apparently, without a strong grasp of how sanctioning one of the world’s largest aluminum producers might impact global markets. Sanctioning En+ and Rusal immediately created significant disruption for European economies and supply chains. Beyond the immediate fallout, such as spikes in aluminum and alumina prices, it became apparent that high-end European manufacturers , such as in the auto industry, depend a great deal on Rusal, and these inputs cannot be replaced before validating alternative suppliers, a process that generally takes at least a year.
Faced with the reality that European partners could not be forced into accepting U.S. secondary sanctions that threatened key manufacturing sectors and workers’ livelihoods in a variety of countries, the administration quickly backed down. It issued a string of licenses to postpone implementation of the sanctions and eventually negotiated what looks to be a fairly toothless divestment agreement reducing Deripaska’s stake in and control of the firms in exchange for lifting the sanctions. (Various knowledgeable figures suggest that the agreement has granted the Treasury Department unprecedented transparency over these firms and will prevent Deripaska from running the show. This seems unlikely.) Early and frank communication with European counterparts could have prevented this embarrassing reversal.
Under CAATSA’s terms, Congress can vote to prevent sanctions relief, and a strong effort was made to block the administration’s plan to delist En+ and Rusal. European governments pushed hard to persuade Congress to go along with the divestment deal, providing detailed information that outlined the economic risks to Europe of the sanctions. Europeans may be forgiven for hoping that such arguments would carry weight with newly empowered congressional Democrats, who had previously argued against the administration’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal by pointing to the necessity of staying aligned with Europe to improve the efficacy of sanctions. In this case, however, pervasive distrust of the administration on Russia—and poor outings from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin explaining the proposal in the face of more pointed questioning than most Trump administration officials have been subjected to—led to a congressional rebuke. Almost 70 percent of House Republicans joined with Democrats to oppose sanctions relief, and eleven Republicans voted against the administration in a 57–42 Senate vote. Because sixty votes were necessary under Senate rules, the administration was still able to proceed with sanctions relief, but not before further worry about U.S. unilateralism had been sown among European allies and partners.
Although additional Russian bad behavior can provide a boost to U.S.-EU unity and joint action, much as it did in the wake of the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Soviet military officer and double agent for the UK’s intelligence services, and his daughter in the UK in March 2018, it would be a mistake to take continued EU support for the sanctions regime for granted. Two years of U.S.-EU-tensions over issues such as climate change, Iran, trade, and European defense expenditures have thoroughly roiled the transatlantic relationship. U.S. rhetoric and threats to impose sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project have gratuitously added insult to injury among German political leaders. (While few dispute Nord Stream 2’s negative implications for European energy security and Ukraine’s role as a transit country, the project is now at an advanced stage of construction; unilateral U.S. sanctions are not the appropriate tool to deal with it.)
The recent creation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for Iran to conduct trade without accessing the U.S. financial system illustrates the lengths to which Germany, France, and the UK are willing to go to support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and to challenge the Trump administration’s threats of secondary sanctions. As former Treasury Department official Elizabeth Rosenberg has warned , Germany’s increasingly defiant stance on Iran may be a taste of its likely response to increased U.S. pressure on Nord Stream 2 and other trade with Russia. SPV-intermediated trade with Iran is likely to remain modest, circumscribed by relatively modest commercial interest. SPV-like techniques could, though, be used to support larger trade flows if the United States and Europe disagree on a sanctions regime where there is not only policy divergence (as with Iran) but also macroeconomically relevant divergence (as with Russia). Such a breakdown between the United States and Europe would, of course, deeply damage the specific sanctions regime in question, but it would also damage transatlantic relations and erode the United States’ leading role in global finance. DASKA: A Grab Bag Proposal
DASKA and other legislation that are under discussion are part of a welcome effort to assert greater congressional control over Russia policy and to create a more comprehensive and powerful sanctions approach. A reintroduced version of the Defending Elections From Threats by Establishing Redlines (DETER) Act, co-sponsored by Senators Macro Rubio and Chris Van Hollen, would seek to prevent Russia and other governments from interfering in U.S. elections by imposing a series of mandatory sanctions. At the same time, DASKA looks like a grab bag of competing proposals, concepts, and reporting requirements. In that respect, it bears a close resemblance to the draft legislation that eventually formed the Russia-related sections of CAATSA.
The lack of focus reflects the competing priorities of DASKA’s six original co-sponsors and makes it far less likely that the bill will pass in anything like its current form. In theory, that could create an opening for adjustments and horse trading based on input from private sector players, foreign governments, and outside experts. At the same time, unforeseeable events could lead to a replay of the last-minute scramble in summer 2017 over CAATSA, which was pieced together in roughly two weeks. Either way, outside stakeholders may find it difficult to challenge more than a handful of DASKA’s controversial provisions.
The draft bill includes several unassailable provisions, including limitations on any attempt by the president to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization without the backing of two-thirds of the Senate. Likewise, DASKA calls for reestablishing the Office of the Coordinator for Sanctions Policy—closed in October 2017—at the State Department. The bill’s specific direction for the sanctions coordinator to boost cooperation with the EU is a step in the right direction. DASKA also includes discretionary measures intended to punish Russian banks that are used for subversive activities or cyber operations aimed at Western democracies. (These elements are watered down from the 2018 version, which called for mandatory sanctions on at least one Russian bank, and appear to be largely redundant with existing executive branch authorities.)
Considerable attention has focused on a provision that would limit the Russian government’s ability to borrow in dollars. But, as experts at the Treasury Department have pointed out previously , Russia’s sizable oil and gas revenue streams and current account surplus mean that it has little need for significant dollar-denominated foreign borrowing. Russia’s outstanding public debt (15.5 percent of GDP) is well below the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average (73 percent of GDP). Total foreign holdings of Russian eurobonds have declined significantly since early 2012, as foreign market participants have built up their positions in the ruble-denominated domestic market. As a result, sanctions on new sovereign debt are unlikely to place a significant constraint on either Russian economic growth or financial market conditions.
Other important provisions of DASKA include mandatory secondary sanctions aimed at the energy sector that will be concerning to U.S. and Western energy firms, as well as to foreign governments that have been key partners in the sanctions program. (Note: The language on monetary amounts was lifted directly from past Iran sanctions legislation without, apparently, analyzing whether it makes sense in the Russian context.) Specific targets include the provision of investments, financing, technology, goods, or services worth more than $1 million or $5 million over a twelve-month period in new crude oil development projects inside Russia; investments in energy projects outside Russia led by Russian state-owned and parastatal entities, which are valued at more than $250 million; and investments in new liquefied natural gas export projects outside Russia valued at more than $1 million or $5 million over a twelve-month period.
Other proposals—for example, a request for the State Department to make a determination on whether Russia is a state sponsor of terrorism—are unlikely to come to fruition. Such a move would “prohibit large classes of U.S. exports to Russia. It would also likely make most U.S. banks quite wary of engaging in ordinary financial transactions with even private companies in Russia, given regulatory requirements for banks that engage in commerce with designated State Sponsors of Terrorism,” according to Harrell and Rosenberg. Similarly, the bill includes sweeping sanctions on the entire Russian shipbuilding sector that would not be lifted unless the secretary of state certifies that Russia has “not interfered with the freedom of navigation of any vessels in the Kerch Strait or elsewhere in a manner inconsistent with international law during [a] three-year period.” The Missing Pieces of Western Strategy
It is not the purpose of this paper to provide an itemized set of recommendations on which tools to adopt or an evaluation of specific proposals already contained in DASKA or elsewhere. Highlighted below are several areas that require additional focus as well as several points on improving the process used to design coercive economic tools focused on Russia. A Recalibrated Focus on Elites
There is a rich body of opinion about whether sanctions against members of the Russian elite have had a significant impact on Putin’s risk calculus. The April 2018 Treasury Department designations of prominent figures such as Deripaska, Viktor Vekselberg, and Suleiman Kerimov, all of whom had long enjoyed the benefits of both high-level Kremlin connections and business relationships in Western countries, represented a significant change in this strategy. The same presumably goes for sanctions against family members (specifically, Putin’s now former son-in-law Kirill Shamalov) and the son of Putin’s longtime close associate Arkadiy Rotenberg, which were announced at the same time, although the precise motivations were not well communicated by the administration.
Still, it is worth recalling that the vast majority of Putin’s inner circle was designated via the so-called cronies list during the earliest stage of Russia’s war in Ukraine in March–April 2014. Such measures have, by all accounts, created anger and frustration inside the Kremlin and among the ranks of the well-to-do. But there is no indication that these moves have encouraged a significant softening in Moscow’s external behavior or fostered splits within ruling circles.
As Carnegie Moscow Center scholar Andrey Movchan has written, the feudalistic nature of the Russian political system means that “there is no true ownership of companies in Russia , only temporary management. Any oligarch who deviates from the regime’s wishes stands to lose everything the very next day. The hungry mouths around Putin are all too happy to help arrange a sale of their assets.” It is quite possible that the Deripaska/Rusal lesson as understood by most oligarchs is that to contend with U.S. pressure, Kremlin support is more necessary now than ever. With the help of other Kremlin-linked institutions, Deripaska emerges from his divestment deal with the United States still extremely wealthy. He would almost certainly be in far worse shape if he had sought to distance himself from the regime. At the same time, some Western experts such as Nigel Gould-Davies are more optimistic, arguing that recent high-level designations could “ disrupt Russia’s political economy —the balances of interest between state and business, and among elite factions that, while never wholly stable, has underpinned the Putin presidency until now.”
Western sanctions have created not only losers but also winners in Putin’s system over the past five years. Import substitution, a renewed focus on agriculture, and restrictions on foreign involvement in state procurement are creating new rents and revenue streams for some players. The sanctions therefore are creating new lobbies inside the regime that favor their continuation, even as they hurt others. Former agriculture minister Aleksandr Tkachev, for example, has said that he hopes Russian counter-sanctions would go on for another ten years. Is it possible to envision future sanctions that might begin to target some of the main beneficiaries of the post-2014 period? Stringent Designation Requirements
A related problem involves potential overuse of parts of the traditional U.S. sanctions tool kit. Consider, for example, the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN). This process tends to be bureaucratically cumbersome and reactive and is not scalable. Typically, only the worst of the worst are put on such lists, including congressionally mandated Magnitsky sanctions against human rights abusers. The vast majority of these figures often do not have significant assets or business activities in U.S. jurisdictions or active U.S. visas. Adding new names to the SDN list risks becoming the executive branch’s default response to new challenges when they arise. The March 2019 designations of individuals and defense/security-related entities more than three months after the Kerch Strait incident are a flagrant case of doing way too little, way too late. Countering Illicit Finance
Members of Congress and policymakers should also begin thinking more creatively about the benefits of transparency measures and other steps that will have applicability far beyond Russia. These efforts can harden the U.S. financial system and economy against flows of illicit funds, help law enforcement officials identify the spoils of high-level corruption, and dissuade undesirable players from seeing the United States as a welcoming jurisdiction. A close reading of the Treasury Department’s National Money Laundering Risk Assessment and National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing , both of which were released in December 2018 and mandated under CAATSA, is instructive in this regard. According to the risk assessment report, upward of $300 billion is laundered in the U.S. financial system annually. Treasury experts describe in stark terms how legal entities are easily misused for money laundering, the hiding of the proceeds of corruption, the disguising of beneficial ownership, and the transferring of funds between the United States and foreign destinations. Focus on Beneficial Ownership
A collective failure by Congress and several past U.S. administrations to deal with beneficial ownership issues is nothing less than a boon to figures connected to corrupt regimes and criminal groups. Even though many such figures have little or no impact on important national security policy issues such as Ukraine or election meddling, members of Congress and U.S. policymakers need to start asking pointed questions about why such wealth is still being parked in U.S. real estate, shell companies, and other investments, and what more can be done to target the techniques that these figures use to cover their tracks. In a 2016 assessment, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which is charged with setting international standards for combating money laundering, rated the United States as noncompliant on matters of transparency and beneficial ownership of legal entities, and it identified the lack of access to beneficial owner information as a “fundamental gap” in the U.S. anti-money-laundering regulatory framework.
Clearly, a much more systematic approach is in order. The draft version of DASKA is curiously silent on transparency issues, although it would make permanent and expand nationwide the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) reporting requirements for title insurance firms on the beneficial owners of domestic and foreign shell companies involved in cash purchases of high-end real estate in select U.S. markets. (FinCEN currently sets these requirements by issuing Geographic Targeting Orders that must be renewed every 180 days and have a defined geographic scope. The most recent GTO covers transactions exceeding $300,000 made at least in part with cash in metropolitan areas in nine states.)
The tide may be turning. For the past decade, Congress has made only halting steps to strengthen transparency for beneficial ownership and restrictions on illicit financial flows and money laundering. A lengthy Treasury-led process on customer due diligence by financial institutions was finally implemented in May 2018 after a two-year delay. While welcome, the new Treasury procedures do not cover the corporation formation process, real estate transactions, or the role of so-called gatekeepers and enablers (that is, the providers of professional services such as attorneys, accountants, and real estate agents). For its part, FATF has recommended applying customer due diligence requirements to designated nonfinancial business professionals.
The House is considering legislation that would require disclosing beneficial ownership during the corporate formation process, keeping such information up to date, and ensuring access to it by law enforcement and other official bodies. Such moves, while welcome, are unlikely to go far enough. For example, foreign companies are unlikely to be covered. Other types of investment vehicles (hedge funds, private equity funds, venture capital funds, partnerships, trusts, and the like) may also be exempted. Lessons Learned From Europe
Over the past few years, the EU has stepped up efforts to counter illicit finance. Successive versions of the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (MLD), which EU member states are required to transpose into their national laws, have arguably put it ahead of the United States in various respects. These directives have codified and strengthened customer due diligence requirements for financial and credit institutions, as well as gatekeepers and company service providers including accountants, tax advisers, legal professionals, and estate agents. The EU also has sought to standardize definitions of money laundering offenses and associated minimum criminal penalties, and to increase EU member-coordination on investigations and prosecutions.
As part of the EU’s risk-based approach, affected entities must also conduct enhanced due diligence on transactions in countries identified by the European Commission as deficient in countering illicit finance . By the end of 2020, EU members will be required to extend criminal liability to legal entities when individuals holding leading positions in those organizations commit any money laundering offenses, which includes “ failing to prevent ” such offenses due to a lack of supervision or control. The EU also has placed a strong emphasis on transparency measures. Member states were required to establish by June 2017 central beneficial ownership registers for companies and legal entities incorporated within their territories that are accessible to official authorities and those involved in customer due diligence. Citing the benefits of enhanced public scrutiny , EU regulators have ordered that these central registers become publicly accessible by January 2020, a move that is intended to strengthen the deterrent effects of reputational risk and preserve trust in the integrity of the financial system. (The regulations contain an exception for central registers of trusts, for which public access to beneficial ownership information will still require demonstrated legitimate interest.) EU regulations also mandate providing relevant authorities with access to central automated registries or electronic data retrieval systems for identifying the ownership of bank and payment accounts (that is, information on account holders, representatives, and beneficial owners)—effectively ending anonymous bank accounts —as well as real estate ownership by individuals and entities.
In the UK, government efforts to counter illicit finance have gained increased urgency since the Skripal attack, demonstrating that significant reforms can be implemented in fairly short time frames if there is political will. UK authorities are now working to extend the beneficial ownership public registry effort, which presently applies only to UK companies as stipulated by the MLD, to cover real estate transactions by overseas entities and companies registered in commonwealth offshore jurisdictions that have long been havens for suspicious activity.
In a similar vein, the UK in early 2018 introduced unexplained wealth orders, which allow UK law enforcement to investigate how “politically exposed persons” suspected of involvement in foreign corruption, as well as suspected criminals, have acquired significant real estate interests and assets that are disproportionate to their lawful incomes. Targets of unexplained wealth orders are required to prove the circumstances surrounding ownership of such property and assets, which can be seized by the authorities under a court order.
So far, UK officials have used these expanded powers on only three occasions, which has raised awkward questions about how far they plan to push things, given inescapable trade-offs between security and prosperity as well as negative impacts on the property market. The UK also has begun to apply greater scrutiny to high-profile foreign nationals applying for investor visas. In recent weeks, the UK National Crime Agency has started encouraging private schools and universities to be more aggressive about due diligence on tuition payments that may come from illicit sources. While significant differences exist between the U.S. and UK/EU systems and legal norms, there clearly is scope for more expansive efforts by U.S. authorities. Coordination With Allies
Congress will—and should—continue to seek to develop tools to create leverage over Moscow in an effort to persuade it to change policies that run counter to U.S. interests—not least to deter continued interference in U.S. and allied democracies. In doing so, it should also adopt as a guiding principle that tools of coercive economic statecraft be coordinated with key allies and partners, especially in Europe and East Asia. This imperative is rooted in three observations: first, that sanctions regimes are more effective and durable when they are multilateral, and especially when they include a larger percentage of the target state’s commercial and trading partners; second, that U.S. sanctions power is sharp but brittle—Europe’s Iran-facing SPV is a measure of the risk facing U.S. financial centrality if unilateralism remains the order of the day in sanctions policy; and third, that blatant disregard of allies’ and partners’ interests in the application of coercive economic tools undermines U.S. relationships beyond simply the damage it does to a specific sanctions regime or sanctions tools in general. Renewed Focus on Diplomacy
Using tools of economic statecraft in a more collaborative manner will require a renewed U.S. focus on diplomacy. The draft DASKA provision to reestablish a sanctions coordination office in the State Department is a good start. The office should be charged with matching sanctions policy objectives to implementation and with coordinating efforts with key partners. The office should also be designed to improve congressional oversight, including a Senate-confirmed chief and regular reporting requirements on sanctions objectives, effectiveness, and diplomatic coordination.
Under most administrations, this step might be adequate to substantially improve coordination with allies and partners. Given the current administration’s demonstrated unilateralism in sanctions policy and broader problems with both filling senior State Department positions and responding to congressional oversight requirements, Congress should take a more active role in coordinating with allies and partners by creating a consultative mechanism to interface with key partners prior to drafting and adopting legislation.
Of course, Congress regularly consults with allies and partners on legislation, but these conversations are usually late in the legislative process and reactive on the part of the partners. Embassies typically review draft sanctions legislation and provide comments to congressional offices. As such, the dialogue is almost always defensive: allies or partners identify a proposed sanction that conflicts with their interests and ask that it be changed or eliminated. This is not coordination. A Broader Dialogue
A dialogue should start much earlier in the process and encompass a broader range of topics, starting with an effort to identify common (and differentiated) interests and objectives and, from there, to build coercive tools that can be implemented in a coordinated manner. This should be an intensive and regular consultation, involving both members of Congress and senior policymakers.
Such a dialogue would certainly provide European and East Asian partners with a venue to underscore specific points of concern—say, on Nord Stream 2 or other major energy projects, for starters. The consultation would also demonstrate that allies and partners are not simply the “party of no,” objecting to proposed sanctions provisions—that is largely an artifact of the reactive way embassies respond to specific legislation. In fact, as outlined above, the United States lags behind allies and partners in a number of areas, starting with beneficial ownership provisions, where stronger U.S. coordination could substantially increase pressure on sanctions targets. Road Map for Sanctions Relief
This consultation can help Congress with one aspect of sanctions policy development that is receiving careful attention in Europe and that, regrettably, is no longer a central consideration for the Russia sanctions program in the United States: having a workable plan for sanctions relief once the policy objective of the sanction has been met, which would improve the negotiating leverage provided by the sanction by making clear that it can be effectively lifted. Such provisions that could provide more direction beyond broad language indicating that sanctions can be terminated if the sanctioned activity has ceased are missing from CAATSA—an error that should not be repeated.
This sort of dialogue is normally within the purview of the executive branch, so there will be challenges to establishing the appropriate channels. These challenges are worth accepting. First, it is Congress, not the executive branch, that is providing the energy behind new sanctions tools. As such, Congress needs to work directly with key partners to ensure that any new sanctions can be implemented in a coordinated and multilateral—which is to say, effective—manner. Second and more important, relations between Washington and its closest allies and partners are already strained. Congress should not run the risk of another Rusal-style disagreement, and Congress cannot depend on the administration to avoid it. End of document"
Democrats Attack The “Arrogance” of Bill Barr As The Attorney General Prepares A Public Report,jonathanturley.org,jonathanturley,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://jonathanturley.org/2019/04/03/democrats-attack-the-arrogance-of-bill-barr-as-the-attorney-general-prepares-a-public-report/,"Democrats Attack The “Arrogance” of Bill Barr As The Attorney General Prepares A Public Report
There was a time when deadlines had a real bite. The term originated from the Civil War when a line was laid out around the notorious Andersonville prison camp. If Union prisoners crossed the line, they were dead.
Thankfully, a deadline is not nearly as lethal or a literal as it once was. Particularly in politics. The Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives garnered a great deal of excitement – and press – over its deadline to Attorney General Bill Barr to turn over the unredacted Mueller report yesterday . . . or else. The House Judiciary Committee also demanded Barr’s immediate appearance as a witness. Barr’s response was a yawn that you would hear all the way down Constitution Avenue. That fact is that Congress can do little in forcing such a release and it knows it. Barr has promised to release a public report within a couple weeks – an impressive feat in redacting a report hundreds of pages in length for a variety of protected forms of information. Congress can certainly subpoena the report, as it has promised today, but such a fight can take months if not years to work its way through the courts.
The problem in such a challenge is the Democratic rhetoric has outstripped political reality. After Barr produced his summary of the conclusions of the Special Counsel, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denounced Attorney General Bill Barr’s actions on the Special Counsel Report as “condescending” and “arrogant.” Others called it all a “cover up.” The reason for this attack may a bit difficult for those outside of Washington to understand. Barr submitted a four-page summary of the conclusions of the Special Counsel to Congress and the public in a remarkably short time. Within a couple days of receiving the report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Barr publicly released a four-page summary of his conclusions. Pelosi was outraged by the sheer arrogance of the act and declared “it wasn’t the right thing to do.” The problem is that it is precisely what Barr is required to do under the Special Counsel regulations and, even though the Democrats are loathe to admit it, Barr has been faster and more open that most critics antificipated.
The Summary
Pelosi was objecting to the fact that Barr would presume to offer his summary of the conclusions rather than yield to the demand that the entire unredacted report be released immediately: “I have said, and I’ll say again, no thank you, Mr. Attorney General, we do not need your interpretation, show us the report and we can draw our own conclusions.”
The problem is that Barr is required to share those conclusions in a summary. The regulations controlling the investigation stipulate that, after the submission of a confidential Special Counsel report, the Attorney General will issue “ brief notifications, with an outline of the actions and the reasons for them.” In order words, Barr is being denounced for being “condescending” and “arrogant” because he is following the rules that Congress demanded that he follow.
On Friday, Barr himself tried to correct the widespread misleading statements about the summary. Noting that House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler referred to the notification as a “four-page summary of the Special Counsel’s review,” Barr stated the obvious that this was merely the “summary of its ‘principal conclusions’—that is, its bottom line.” Nevertheless, experts and hosts on CNN and MSNBC continued to fuel the false narrative that this was a summary of all of the investigative findings.
Some have even argued that those principal conclusions may be misrepresented by Barr since a couple days is simply not enough time to digest hundreds of pages of the report. These attacks are based on two flawed assumptions. First, they absurdly suggest that Mueller’s report did not have its own summary of its findings or conclusions. Second, they suggest that Mueller was not consulted and has remained silent in the face of a false summary. Neither seems plausible or likely. Mueller (who has a long friendship with Barr) is working with Barr on the redactions to the report and has remained active in this process. Thus, it is not only likely that the summary was an accurate account but that Mueller was fully briefed on that summary.
The Report
Various Democratic members have insisted that nothing will suffice unless Barr releases the full and unredacted Special Counsel report. Indeed, in his confirmation, various Democrats demanded that Barr promised to release the report even though it was not completed and Barr had not seen its content. If Barr had made such a promise to secure his confirmation, he would have been manifestly unqualified for the position. Various types of information are by law prohibited from public disclosure including Rule 6(e) information from grand juries – information that can only be disclosed by court order. There are also three areas noted correctly by Barr that require redactions: classified information, statutorily protected privacy information and information related to ongoing investigations.
There were two notable exceptions involving the release of investigative reports containing grand jury information but both cases involved findings of criminal conduct by a president. The Justice Department released such information as part of the Watergate investigation detailing criminal conduct by President Richard Nixon. Later, in 1998, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr’s report was made public with grand jury information with allegations of criminal conduct by Bill Clintoin, including lying under oath.
Barr has confirmed that the Mueller expressly concluded that there was not evidence establishing criminal conduct linked to collusion by Trump or his campaign. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded that there was not a basis for a criminal obstruction charge. Accordingly, Barr is proceeding with conventional redactions before making the report public. Of course, if Congress concludes that there is a basis for impeachment in the report, it can revisit the issue and seek a court order for the unsealing of the information.
The Process
Most importantly, Barr has announced that he does not intend to give President Trump a copy of the report before it is made public. Barr noted “Although the President would have the right to assert privilege over certain parts of the report, he has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me and, accordingly, there are no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review.”
In his letter, Barr cited the four areas of possible redaction but did not include executive privileged information, which would normally be included. He expressly declared that he had “no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review.” The waiver of all executive privilege claims in such a report is as commendable as it is unprecedented. Indeed, for all of his inappropriate comments on the investigation, Trump has far outstripped the Obama Administration which routinely refused core oversight material to Congress. In this case, Trump is waiving all privilege arguments and will not even been given an advance copy of the public report.
What is particularly impressive about this decision is that Trump’s legal team has been reserving privilege claims. Disclosures to Mueller did not constitute waivers since it was all within the Justice Department but there appears to be a complete waiver and Trump (and Barr) deserves credit for that decision.
On Friday, Barr again reaffirmed his intention release the report, stating “Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own. I do not believe it would be in the public’s interest for me to attempt to summarize the full report or to release it in serial or piecemeal fashion.”
So to recap. Barr already issued the required notification without even a reasonable delay. He has committed to releasing a public report in a matter of weeks – no small feat with hundreds of pages with statutorily protected information. He is making all redactions with the assistance of Mueller and has confirmed that executive privilege claims have been waived.
When I testified at the Barr’s confirmation hearing, Democratic senators asked what Trump expected in nominating Barr as Attorney General. I responded that I did not know what Trump thought he was getting in Bill Barr but I know what he got. Barr could be expected to do two things. First, he will do exactly what the law demands. Second, he will do exactly what he promised to do. He promised to get as much of the Special Counsel report to the public as possible. Thus far, he is doing exactly that – and in a fraction of the expected time. Share this:"
The Crucial Role of the Military in the Venezuelan Crisis,www.globalissues.org,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.globalissues.org/news/2019/04/03/25166,"The Crucial Role of the Military in the Venezuelan Crisis The Crucial Role of the Military in the Venezuelan Crisis by Dr Diego Lopes da Silva, Dr Nan Tian ( stockholm
STOCKHOLM, Apr 03 (IPS) - Dr Diego Lopes da Silva is a Researcher with the Arms and Military Expenditure Programme at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) .& Dr Nan Tian is a Researcher with the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure Programme.In January 2019 Venezuela's opposition-led National Assembly swore in congressman Juan Guaidó as the country's interim president. Guaidó's claim to power is a severe blow against the already weakened government of Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election as president in May 2018 was widely rejected by the international community and deemed illegitimate by over 50 foreign governments.
Since January 2019, about 65 countries—including the United States and countries in Western Europe and most of South America—have given their support to Guaidó. The USA has also imposed sanctions on the state oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), and several state-owned banks.
However, countries such as China, Cuba and Russia continue to back Maduro and recognize him as the legitimate president of Venezuela.
Although the support of foreign states is an important factor in the current political standoff between Maduro and Guaidó, it is the Venezuelan military that will determine whether there is any shift in power. Historically, the armed forces have played a decisive role in the country's politics: the military oversaw Venezuela's transition to democracy in 1958 and has had a strong influence on domestic politics ever since.
The 1958 Punto Fijo Pact—the political agreement aimed at preserving democracy in Venezuela in the post-authoritarian period—rested on a compromise with the military: in return for transferring power to civilian hands, the military would have its equipment modernized and its salaries revised.
The administration of President Hugo Chávez (1999–2013) further strengthened the position of the armed forces by populating the state bureaucracy with military officers and implementing large-scale arms modernization programmes, which took Venezuelan military spending to record levels.
This feature of Venezuelan politics has not gone unnoticed by Guaidó, who has attempted to garner support from the armed forces by offering amnesty to defectors. So far, the bulk of the military has remained loyal to Maduro: in the wake of the National Assembly's appointment of Guaidó as interim president, the defence minister, Vladimir Padrino, stated that Venezuela's armed forces disavow any president who is self-proclaimed.
Nevertheless, despite Padrino's assurances, cracks have formed in the military's support for the Maduro administration. Since February, about 560 soldiers, who recognized Guaidó as the country's interim president, have fled to Colombia.
Amid these developments, the military is on the cusp of an important choice: preserve the status quo or support a new leader. The final decision will largely depend on the offers made by Maduro and Guaidó.
Military incentives: power, money and arms
Since 1958, the Venezuelan armed forces have traded military support for the government in exchange for money, power and prestige. This bargaining process was reinforced under the Chávez administration, which offered the military political power, money and arms, and strengthened the development of a military–government symbiosis.
One of Chávez's first and major accomplishments was to approve a new constitution in 1999, creating the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, also known as the Fifth Republic. This served as the foundation for the military's rise to the higher echelons of political power.
Article 328 of the new constitution, for example, incorporated the armed forces into the maintenance of social order and the formulation of Venezuela's national development plans.
Perhaps more importantly, Article 236 granted Chávez the right to approve promotions of colonels and generals—an instrument he used regularly to purge dissidents and promote loyal officers.
As a result, military officers took on key positions in state-owned companies, ministries and funding agencies. According to Transparencia Venezuela, at least 60 of the 576 state-run companies are led by the military, including PDVSA.
The militarization of the government has continued under Chávez's successor, Maduro. As of January 2019, 9 of 32 government ministries were controlled by the military, including the ministries of agriculture and energy.
As a consequence, the military's influence on and within government has grown to a level not seen in Venezuela since the end of Marcos Pérez Jiménez's dictatorship in 1948.
Off-budget mechanisms Venezuelan military spending soared under the Chávez administration. In 2006 it surpassed that of Brazil—which at that time had an economy over five times larger than Venezuela's.
Chávez's spending was enabled by the unprecedented oil boom that started soon after he took office, which allowed him to strengthen his grip on power by distributing money to his supporters—a long-standing pattern in Venezuelan politics.
However, the total amount of funding allocated to the armed forces since the establishment of the Fifth Republic remains the subject of debate. The uncertain estimates are due to the existence of off-budget mechanisms in military funding.
Off-budget military funding is the allocation of funds for defence functions from outside the regular state budget. This can include revenues from mineral extraction or from military business activities.
Venezuela's main off-budget funding instrument is the National Development Fund (Fondo de Desarrollo Nacional, FONDEN), funded primarily by the Central Bank of Venezuela and PDVSA. Created in 2005, FONDEN was intended ostensibly to foster economic growth and sustainable development in Venezuela.
However, because the military has been constitutionally integrated into the Venezuelan development strategy since 1999 (Article 328 of the constitution), its activities are eligible for FONDEN's support. The office of the president has exclusive control over FONDEN, which exempts it from oversight by the National Assembly.
SIPRI's 2017 review of Venezuelan military spending concluded that since 2005 a substantial amount of the country's oil revenue and state resources had been diverted to the military using FONDEN. For example, between 2005 and 2015 FONDEN allocated around $6.9 billion to the military to finance 39 projects.
The largest of those was an allocation of $2.2 billion for the purchase of 24 Su-30 combat aircraft from Russia. On average, off-budget allocations from FONDEN increased Venezuela's annual military spending by 26 per cent for the period 2005–15.
As FONDEN is funded primarily by oil revenues, its level of contribution to Venezuelan military spending each year reflects the annual fluctuations in oil prices. Between 2005 and 2015 its contribution to military spending ranged from 42 per cent in 2015, which coincided with rising oil prices, to as little as 1 per cent in 2009 and 2014, when the price of oil fell sharply.
In comparison with its allocations to other funding recipients between 2005 and 2015, FONDEN's allocations to the military were substantial. The $6.9 billion given to the military dwarfed the $2.6 billion allocated to education and health, demonstrating a clear shift in the purpose of the fund towards militarization as opposed to development.
Through FONDEN, the armed forces have gained direct access to Venezuela's substantial oil revenues. These funds were used in a variety of ways: for instance, $5.1 million was paid to fund the education of 40 Venezuelan cadets in Belarus in 2010, while $106 million was allocated to the general category ‘Complementary Agreement on State Security and Defence' (Acuerdos Complementarios de Seguridad y Defensa de Estado).
However, the bulk of FONDEN's allocations to the military was used to boost Venezuela's ambitious military modernization programme. Chávez saw the build-up of arms as a fundamental step in sustaining his revolutionary regime: ""When I talk about armed revolution, I am not speaking metaphorically; armed means rifles, tanks, planes, and thousands of men ready to defend the revolution.""
Oil revenues became the chief contributor to Chávez increasing the power of the presidency and the military force of Venezuela. Venezuelan arms imports grew significantly in the 2000s and early 2010s. The vast majority of these imports came from Russia and China.
The military maintains its strength, despite the economic downturn
Maduro became president of Venezuela after Chavez's death in 2013 and inherited his carefully constructed militarized state apparatus. However, unlike his predecessor, Maduro came to power in a harsh economic environment. Oil prices plunged in 2014, which exacerbated the country's economic downturn.
Venezuela has found itself embroiled in the biggest economic and social crisis of its recent history. Salaries have been negatively impacted by hyperinflation, while basic goods have become extremely scarce.
Violence has also spiked. Severe living conditions have led more than three million Venezuelans to flee the country, while millions of those who remain are calling for change.
As a reaction to a rapidly shrinking economy and falling oil production and oil revenue, Maduro turned towards the country's food supply as a source of patronage, a commodity that went from subsidized to scarce. By exploiting a complex currency system, members of the military were able to import food at an advantageous rate of exchange and then sell it on the black market for hundreds of times the government set price.
While these privileges appear to have swayed the military to support the Maduro administration for the time being, they are mainly aimed at officers, and many lower-ranking soldiers face the same hardships as ordinary Venezuelan citizens.
In addition to its role in the exploitation of the food supply, the military occupies a position of privilege during the allocation of the state budget. Official military spending is prioritized over vital social needs such as education, housing and food.
In 2017, Maduro used his presidential prerogative to bypass the opposition-led National Assembly and approve a new budget that benefited his allies. As the rate of inflation soared into thousands of per cents in 2018, additional funding was needed for all government sectors.
Not only was the military one of the first to receive the additional resources, but it was also among the sectors that received the highest allocations of the new funding. This is not the first time the military's budget has been protected from significant cuts—far from it. In 1962, while total public spending was cut by 12 per cent, the military budget was reduced by only 4 per cent.
The discrepancy was even greater in 1979: despite a 15 per cent reduction in total public spending, the military budget was cut by only 0.4 per cent. Thus by giving the military control of the country's food supply and prioritizing the military in state budgets, Maduro has continued the long tradition in Venezuela of trading resources for political support in a bid to retain power.
The military's role in shaping Venezuela's future
The protected status of the military budget and the off-budget funding allocated to the armed forces from FONDEN are clear examples of the military's privileged position in Venezuela, granting the armed forces a key role in shaping the country's future.
By giving the military money, power and prestige, Maduro has—at least for the time being—‘bought' the political backing of the armed forces. The challenge faced by Guaidó is arduous: he must somehow win over the support of a military that owes its strength to the current regime.
So far, Guaidó has offered amnesty to defectors. He has also appealed to the military's sense of nationalism, arguing that his claim to the presidency is a people's demand to which the armed forces should heed.
Considering the set of benefits from the current patronage system, such as the billions of dollars on offer from off-budget sources and the positions of privilege in key government posts, Guaidó might need to offer the military the same, if not better, incentives than those it has received under Chávez and Maduro.
Yet, therein lies the conundrum: if Guaidó courts the military into backing his plea by offering material incentives, he will empower the military further and be complicit in replicating one of the main weaknesses of Venezuela's democracy.

Smart Cities hold Key to Sustainable Development,www.globalissues.org,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.globalissues.org/news/2019/04/03/25165,"Smart Cities hold Key to Sustainable Development Smart Cities hold Key to Sustainable Development by Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana ( bangkok, thailand
BANGKOK, Thailand, Apr 03 (IPS) - Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana is UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).Asia and the Pacific's phenomenal development has been a story of rapid urbanization. As centres of innovation, entrepreneurship and opportunity, cities have drawn talent from across our region and driven economic growth which has transformed our societies.
In southeast Asia alone, cities generate 65 percent of the region's GDP. Yet the ongoing scale of urbanization is a considerable challenge, one which puts huge pressure on essential public services, housing availability and the environment.
How we respond to this pressure, how we manage our urban centres and plan for their future expansion in Asia and the Pacific, is likely to decide whether recent development gains can be made sustainable.
It is of primordial importance to Malaysia as its economy powers towards high income status. In ASEAN countries, 90 million more persons are expected to move to cities by 2030.
Accommodating this influx sustainably will determine whether the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development can be achieved, and the climate targets of the Paris Climate Agreement can be met.
An effective response calls for integrated planning across all levels of government. Greater consideration needs to be given to demographic and land use trends to anticipate their impacts and minimize environmental damage. These trends should inform our investments in infrastructure but also in water, energy and transport services.
Closing the infrastructure gap in the region will alone require an additional $200 billion of investment a year until 2030. We know local government revenues are mostly insufficient and fiscal decentralization inadequate to respond to this need.
Intelligent fiscal reforms to improve local revenues are likely to be necessary and we will need to consider how we can capture land value and use Public-Private Partnerships.
In the most disaster-prone region in the world, it is incumbent on us to reduce the risk of natural disasters to which millions of urban dwellers are exposed. By 2030, vulnerable populations living in extreme risk areas - along river banks, canals and slopes - are expected to have grown by fifty percent since 2015 in many of region's major cities.
Some cities, including Melaka, are participating in initiatives such as the 100 Resilient Cities, focused on community-based disaster risk reduction. Yet this effort needs to be given even greater scale if we are to achieve risk resilient cities in our region. Accelerating our multilateral cooperation and best practice sharing could make a valuable contribution to doing so.
New technologies hold great promise for more effective urban solutions. From smart grids and district energy solutions, or real-time traffic management, to waste management and water systems, smart technologies will enable our future cities to operate more effectively.
They could also make them more inclusive and accessible for persons with disabilities. We have an opportunity to incorporate universal design standards and systems such as automated access to audio-based communications to improve accessibility to cities for persons with disabilities.
We must encourage smart city developers to use standards which would give persons with diverse disabilities full access to the physical infrastructure and information others enjoy.
As we look to overcome all these challenges, the ASEAN Smart Cities Network designed to mobilize smart solutions throughout southeast Asia, is a welcome development on which we must build.
The implementation of this network is something the organization I represent, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, has worked to support.
Combined with the ASEAN's broader Sustainable Urbanization Strategy, it is helping provide much needed resource in the region to manage urbanization better. Twenty-six cities, including Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru are developing visions for their cities to apply technologies for smart and sustainable urban development.
The expertise being acquired is invaluable to the broader region's effort. Malaysia has a leading role to play. At the 9th World Urban Forum Malaysia hosed last year, experts came from the world over to focus on cities for all and the New Urban Agenda.
In October 2019, the 7th Asia Pacific Urban Forum will be held in Penang. My hope is that this can focus minds and galvanize support for best practice to be shared and sustainable urban development to be prioritized in Asia and the Pacific.

She has served as vice chair of the European Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for five years, and has led the Social Democrats in the parliament for ten.
With the experiences from those years under her belt, she has gotten a lot of insight in how the far-right in Europe reasons on issues relating to the labour market.
At the moment, 7 out of 52 delegates in the committee belong to parties that are considered to be positioned on the far right. Among them are neo-Nazi Golden Dawn from Greece, right-wing populist National Rally and Lega Nord from France and Italy, and fascist Jobbik from Hungary.
Marita Ulvskog says that the far-right members in the committee often stick together when voting. They mostly support propositions from the established conservative parties, but sometimes they'll vote for left-wing propositions which align with trade union policies.
The far-right parties are often in favour of strong unemployment benefit policies and certain kinds of social welfare reforms.
In Poland, national-conservative government party Law and Justice recently increased child support. In Hungary, Victor Orbán's government wants to introduce a tax break for women with four or more children, in an effort to encourage women to give birth to more ""Hungarian"" children.
""They often want to appear to be progressive in matters regarding trade union rights. Meanwhile, they vote very differently to us when it comes to issues concerning women's rights in the labour market,"" says Marita Ulvskog.
In the last few years, several nationalist trade unions have emerged throughout Europe.
In the south of Germany, a few far-right trade unions came together under the name ""Patriotic Unions"", which has close ties to right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany.
Their foothold is strongest within the auto industry. IG Metall has actively tried to counter their organisation and so far, the right-wing unions have not been very successful.
Swedish author and commentator Lars Jederlund has been following European politics since the 1990's and recently released the book Ödesvalet(The Fateful Election), about right-wing parties in Europe.
He explains that it's a motley crew of parties, with many different outsets. Some are fascists, others religious right-wing fundamentalists or right-wing populists. He places the Swedish Democrats in the group ""Ethnocentric right-wing parties"", together with Poland's Law and Justice and the Danish People's Party.
Their differences aside, there are some unifying factors.
""They oppose immigration and the EU,"" says Lars Jederlund.
If the far right manages to strengthen its position after the election, the number of members of parliament with critical views on issues like free trade agreements will increase, which could affect the labour market.
These parties are also sceptical of the Union's initiatives to reduce social injustice.
The Swedish Democrats strongly oppose the European Pillar of Social Rights, because the party worry that it will lead to regulations that will affect the Swedish model.
Already today, seven EU member states are led by parties on the far right; Poland, Hungary, Austria, Italy, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria. Most polls indicate that the right-wing parties will increase their number of seats after the election, while the Social Democrats of Europe are predicted to make a weak election.
Marita Ulvskog explains that the reason for this development is that the European Social Democrats haven't been as good as these parties at storytelling.
""This, of course, is because we can't trick people. We have to stick to the truth and they don't.""
Franziska Schröter, from the German political think tank Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, which has close ties to the German Social Democrats, works with analysing the growing far-right movement. She says that these political parties put a lot of effort into spreading their message online.
""Here, Alternative for Germany has about 20 employees working with social media to spread the messages of its parliamentarians. The Social Democrats have two.""
""That's a massive gap. You could say that the established parties are focusing on doing their job and advancing politics while Alternative for Germany are focusing on communication.""
Theres another factor too. Followers of the far right are much more active on social media, and they attack their opponents on the internet.
""They are passionate and they hate,"" she says.
""Hate is a much easier feeling to foster than love. To affect others by spreading fear is very effective.""

UNITED NATIONS, Apr 03 (IPS) - Young Rohingya refugees are now facing new hardships as the Bangladeshi government cracks down on their education and future opportunities.

Since January, the Government of Bangladesh has ordered the expulsion of Rohingya refugee children from schools, prompting an outcry from human rights groups.
""The Bangladeshi government's policy of tracking down and expelling Rohingya refugee students instead of ensuring their right to education is misguided, tragic, and unlawful…education is a basic human right,"" said Human Rights Watch's (HRW) senior children's rights researcher Bill Van Esveld.
""If education is for all, education should be for Rohingya,"" an expelled Rohingya student told HRW.
The expelled students, who are among the 34,000 registered Rohingya refugees living in camps in the Teknaf and Ukhiya sub-districts in Cox's Bazar, were born in Bangladesh after their families fled Myanmar in the early 1990s.
However, the majority of Rohingya children, including those born in Bangladesh, are not formally recognised as refugees and are not allowed to enrol in Bangladeshi schools.
Without access to education, Rohingya families often paid for Bangladeshi birth certificates or other documents in order for their children to attend school.
One student said his family spent months saving to pay 3,500 taka or 42 dollars to buy a Bangladeshi brith certificate so that they can pass as Bangladeshi nationals.
Another student pretended his parents were dead to avoid listing their refugee camp address on his school application.
In January, officials sent a notice to the directors of seven secondary schools in Teknaf and a government official in Ukhiya which warned about the increase in Rohingya children's school attendance and the ""dishonest public representatives"" who have helped them acquire documents.
""We were informed by the intelligence agencies under the Prime Minister's Office that Rohingya children are attending different educational institutions in Teknaf sub-district. It is ordered … to take strict measures so that no Rohingya children can attend any Bangladeshi educational institutions outside of the camps,"" the notice said.
While it is unclear how many Rohingya were expelled, the notice listed the names and addresses of 44 Rohingya students and included orders to expel them as well as any others.
The founder of one secondary school said intelligence officials warned him that having Rohingya students was ""not safe for the country, not safe for our people.""
Van Esveld criticised the move, stating: ""The solution to children feeling compelled to falsify their identities to go to secondary school isn't to expel them but to let them get the education they deserve.""
Mohammed recounted the day he got expelled to HRW, stating: "" said that if there were any Rohingya, the Education Ministry will cancel the license of the school. When the notice was read out, the headmaster said, ‘I know who all the Rohingya are. Don't hesitate, leave your books and IDs here and go.' In the class, in front of the Bangladeshi students, they separated us out, and told us to leave.""
Rahim was in English class when a vice principal came and asked the Rohingya students to leave.
""I went to a secret place and I cried. My aim was to be a doctor. What should I do now?"" he said.
While there are some schools in refugee camps, they are not formally accredited and only run through to grade 8.
Refugee children at camp schools are also barred from taking national examinations or receiving official certifications indicating that they passed any level of education.
Without formal education, Rohingya children have no proof of their education and are unable to apply to universities.
HRW urged Bangladesh to stop the expulsion of Rohingya students and to ensure all children are able to receive a formal education.
In April 2018, the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights also expressed concern over the Rohingya's lack of access to education and recommended Bangladesh to fully incorporate the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (CESCR), of which Bangladesh is a party to, into domestic law.
CESCR includes the importance of children's rights to all levels of education regardless of immigration or refugee status.
""As long as Rohingya refugee children aren't able to obtain a formal education in the camps, Bangladesh should allow them to enrol in local schools,"" Van Esveld said.
""The government should stop thwarting Rohingya students' right to learn,"" he added.

China and Developing Countries: Managing Chinese Investments,www.globalissues.org,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.globalissues.org/news/2019/04/03/25162,"China and Developing Countries: Managing Chinese Investments China and Developing Countries: Managing Chinese Investments by Daud Khan ( rome
ROME, Apr 03 (IPS) - Fifty years ago China was a poor country with little influence in the international sphere and without even a seat at the United Nations. Since then rapid economic growth in China has made it an economic powerhouse that increasingly plays a leading role on the world stage as a trade partners as well as a source of investment. The harbour expansion in Colombo seeks to tap into the lucrative Indian shipping trade, with Chinese help. Credit: Amantha Perera/IPS
China's development trajectory has been much different from most other developing countries which have been often been buffeted by political and economic problems and have failed to grow at anywhere near their potential.
In the first of this two part article we would like to explore how best developing countries can benefit from the ongoing and planned flow of Chinese investments into the country. In the second part we will look at some of the key element of China's development experience and, see what lessons we can draw for policies and programmes.
The most iconic and discussed manifestation of China's increased economic and political clout is the Belt and Road Initiative that aims to link China with markets in Europe and Asia.
The Initiative is largely about improving trade and logistics. At the same time, major investments are also being made in mining, manufacturing, agriculture and services - both for export to the Chinese markets as well as for sale in domestic markets. These investments are being made in both developed and developing countries.
However, their impact is likely to be enormous and transformational in the latter, especially in those developing countries that have been stuck in a trap of slow growth and low investment. This is a huge opportunity but in order to maximise its benefits it is essential that these investments are well managed and regulated.
Most Chinese firms investing overseas tend to be middle to large enterprises. Many are state owned, or subsidiaries of state owned companies, and, as such, enjoy good government connections and backing.
These factors give them superior bargaining power vis-a-vis local counterparts and there is risk that the terms of agreement may be tilted in their favour. Such risks are particularly acute in countries where counterpart local enterprises tend to be small with limited financial and administrative skills.
There is an urgent need for laws, regulation and guidelines that ensure that contracts and agreements signed are fair and equitable. This is critical for all sectors, but especially so for activities such as mining, which require massive investment and long gestation periods, where agreements can be for decades.
A number of critical aspects require public oversight including royalty payments and financial parameters, such as interest rates, depreciation rates and insurance fees.
There is also a need to ensure that prices charged for the output of Chinese firms sold in local markets are fair and within reach of domestic consumers; that there is no ""transfer pricing"" in the case of exports – this is a practice where companies sell at low prices to parent companies overseas in order to reduce profits and tax liabilities, while at the same time reducing the inflow of foreign exchange into the host country; that taxes, duties and other levies are fully paid in time; that negative environment impacts are mitigated and, when necessary, remedial actions are put in place; that workers are paid fair wages and that essential services such as medical assistance and education are provided to them; and that current land owners, farmers and tenants are not displaced from their lands and houses.
It may appear that these conditions are harsh and risk alienating Chinese investors. However, Chinese investment should not be simply an opportunity to make a quick return but as a long-term partnership that is based on mutual benefits that are shared, also with workers.
These conditions, including on transfer pricing, are common for transnational investors in most developed countries and in these countries Chinese companies have no problem adhering to them. There is no reason that similar condition are not set in developing countries and that Chinese firms should comply with them.
Moreover, over the last couple of decades, under pressure from consumer lobbying, boycotts and law suits in their countries of origin, many US and European companies, including the large multinationals, are increasingly conforming to such laws and regulations.
Many of them now also have significant Corporate Social Responsibility programmes. Chinese companies, if they expect to complete in the medium to long-term with Western corporations, must be prepared to do the same.
It is Government's prerogative and duty to make laws, regulations and guidelines to manage overseas investment. However, such laws are notoriously difficult to implement in developing countries with limited governance capacities.
It will be more so in the case of Chinese investors which, as mentioned above, tend to be big and well connected.
Moreover, it is unlikely that NGOs, pressure groups and civil society groups in China will take it upon themselves to lobby against unfair trade or manufacturing operations of Chinese companies in other countries, as happened in the case of US and Europeans companies.
In this situation, much responsibility rests with the civil society, the press and the judicial system in developing countries. These institutions need to take up the challenge.
This will not be easy and help would be required from the international development community. At political level, the UN and other official agencies need to help governments to daft laws and regulations; and international NGOs, lobby groups and consumer associations will need to create and help counterpart organizations in developing countries.
However, the most difficult hurdle will be for Governments in developing countries to start seeing civil society organizations, the press and the judicial systems as key partners in the development process and not as impediments to trade and financial partnerships.

POHNPEI, Apr 03 (IPS) - Elizabeth Keller is one of the most senior health officials in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). She is the current acting chief of Public Health and also the head of the leprosy programme in the island nation's capital of Pohnpei.
While Pohnpei has the largest number of leprosy cases in the country—nearly 100 new cases are reported here every year—Keller says that more new cases doesn't necessarily present an alarming picture. She says that this should be viewed instead as a positive sign that the government's activities are effective as more people are coming forward to be diagnosed than ever before.
During a recent visit of the Sasakawa Health Foundation / Nippon Foundation team to Micronesia's Health Ministry, Keller talks about how her department is trying to protect the children of Pohnpei from leprosy, otherwise known as Hansen's disease. She also talks of the unique perspective and strength that a female leader like her can bring to public health.

Collusion Hiding in Plain Sight,www.counterpunch.org,Doug Noble,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/collusion-hiding-in-plain-sight/print/,"Donald Trump’s suspected “collusion” with Russia in the 2016 elections has been extensively investigated. But almost nothing has been said about his, and Congress members’, open collusion with another nation, Israel, whose pervasive impact on US elections and US policy takes place in plain sight. Despite courageous critiques by Rep Omar and others, few candidates for Congress or members of Congress, including its top leaders, are willing to risk challenging US policy toward Israel or the impact of its American lobbying arm, AIPAC.
Since taking office, Trump has openly colluded with Netanyahu’s Israel. Early in his term, Trump made a unilateral decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a holy site of both Jews and Muslims. This despite the city’s designation since 1948 as an international protectorate, only half controlled, through conquest, by Israel. Now Trump has unilaterally “recognized” Israeli sovereignty of Syria’s Golan Heights, occupied through conquest by Israel since 1967. Both of Trump’s actions support Israel in its ongoing violation of international law prohibiting any nation’s acquisition or annexation of land occupied throught conquest.
Trump also turns a blind eye to the murderous crimes against humanity that continue to be perpetrated by Israel against Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Instead he provides the money for Israel’s weapons, at $3.3 billion in foreign military financing, more than the United States provides to the rest of the world combined.
Now that’s real collusion. But who’s looking, let alone investigating?"
Stealing Democracy in an Age of Kleptocrats,www.counterpunch.org,Evaggelos Vallianatos,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/stealing-democracy-in-an-age-of-kleptocrats/print/,"There’s something in me that revolts against injustice and wrong. Like the genes that transmit our genetic inheritance, there are intellectual forces – call them Metis assets from the Greek goddess of intelligence Metis — that define us as human beings no less than the biological markers of skin color, height, etc.
Metis inheritance
I received my Metis inheritance from my parents and Greek culture in both Greece and the United States. I cannot say how this transmission took place. But I can say immersing oneself in Greek thought, as I did for decades, helps to see the world with the eyes of justice, the beautiful and the good.
That is the reason I did not become a “team player” at the US Environmental Protection Agency, a prospect of higher salary and advancement. I saw the wrong embedded in the laws, regulations, and the sleazy behavior of industry lobbyists and senior EPA officials.
Billionaires undermine society and democracy
Behind this unseemly politics was money, lots of money in the billions. In my college teaching, during the first class meeting, I would ask my students a simple question. How many of you like or dislike billionaires? Are they citizens like you or their tremendous wealth makes them different, perhaps, a threat to our democracy?
My students were equally divided. About 50 percent had no trouble with billionaires. The rest expressed uneasiness with people with so much power. After all, they said, we live in a democracy, don’t we?
Yes, indeed. Do we live in a democracy? But what is a democracy?
Even in ancient Athens credited with having invented and practiced a hands-on radical democracy, the process of democracy – rule by the people — was complicated and difficult. It demanded the active and perpetual participation of thousands of citizens for the administration of justice and deciding the policies of the polis.
The Athenians had their own billionaires whom they obliged to pay for national defense and public festivals.
What do we do with our billionaires? Practically nothing, save for allowing them not to pay taxes, and continue with their kleptocratic (thieving) practices and business.
The results are catastrophic.
Billionaires accumulate even more wealth and the power that goes with it. They separate themselves from the rest of us. They employ armies of servants to keep them safe and well fed, behind impregnable castles of technology, brick and mortar. Their lobbyists have been bribing Congress and the White House for decades.
What do the bribes buy for the billionaire class? No oversight of their business, giving them free hand in pollution, monopoly in the market, control of the prices they sell their products, even if that means death for people who cannot afford those products, as it happens with drugs of the pharmaceutical industry.
The bribes also gut democracy, even the long-distance, second-hand democracy we have in the United States. Those receiving the bribes are politicians “we elect” to Congress and state legislatures. But these bribed politicians have no dignity or honor, signing on the dotted line with their paymasters. They certainly don’t serve us or democracy.
As if these hostile acts are not enough, now, in 2019, the billionaire class is using the so-called media (large TV and radio networks, and newspapers) to either raise doubts about global warming or to bamboozle Americans that climate change is a hoax. The cheerleader of this insidious propaganda is none other than president Donald Trump. In fact, the billionaires “elected” Trump to boost the petroleum monopolies and the industrial-agricultural-military complex.
Trump and his buddies somehow have exorcised rising temperatures. Like dark-age landlords, they have convinced themselves they are invulnerable to the rising climate calamities. Their skyscrapers promise fake security. As for the rest of humanity, including their children and grandchildren, don’t seem to cross the megalomania and hubris engulfing their metal brains.
Stealing democracy
In fact, the billionaires are having such a great time in America, they are building a wall of permanently annulling the democracy-like practices still surviving, like electing, from time to time, whom we like. They see the rising majorities in non-white people with alarm. So, they are stealing millions of votes all over the country.
I don’t know how billionaire kleptocracy does this in the middle of the night. But Greg Palast does. This is an extraordinary investigative reporter that does not mince words. I met him recently. He speaks of thieves at the highest levels of America, among billionaires especially. He wrote an eye-opener book, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy: A Tale of Billionaires and Ballot Bandits (Seven Stories Press, 2016).
Ted Rall translates the tales of Palast into a small comic book, The Crypt of Democracy . Then this comic book finds itself into the heart of Palast’s book, enriching the overall purpose and impact of the stories Palast relates with so much originality, excitement, integrity and anger.
Read this book. It’s well-written. It is provocative. It tells stories that should anger any American with democratic values and patriotism. It is a riveting chronicle of kleptocracy, especially vote heist. It will probably shock you.
Corruption is so thick among the rulers of America (billionaires) that they threaten to make this country worse than a banana police state. They mix the selling of religion with stealing diamonds from Congo and the petroleum of Venezuela. They bribe dictators in Asia in order to buy their petroleum at a cheap price . They are in bed with Saudi Arabia, the worst religious theocracy on Earth, the very country funding Islamic fanatics all over the world.
All American presidents that I remember paid homage to the petroleum kings of Saudi Arabia. Palast calls them dictators in bathrobes.
“The Oval Office has been the residence of craven con men, sanctimonious scoundrels, psychopathic blood worshippers, vainglorious vulgarities, rich dicks and wannabe rich dicks, fraudsters, fakers, and worse: hollow suits, scarecrows, chattering death masks, and men without meaning even to themselves,” wrote Palast.
Palast, however, uses more than rhetorical flourish. He means what he says. For example, he does not simply recommend vote reform. He denounces the billionaires. But he goes further. He uses the surgical knife to cut out the cause of kleptocracy: “ put an end to billionaires… take away their billions, ” he says."

Same ol’ same ol’ battle: The more things change, the more they stay the same
On August 21, 2009, The Wall Street Journal reported that “…many scientists say deep emissions cuts are necessary … to prevent … dangerous consequences of global warming,” and also reported that, “Getting from here to there would require a massive economic shift.”
There’s likely been no better summary of the Green New Deal’s basic rationale.
In just a few words, the Journal succinctly stated a dangerous trend of rising emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, identified the scale of action necessary to putting a lid on the danger, and did that 10 years before the Sunrise Movement caught the attention of newly elected Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
The details on either the science or economic side of the responses to the Green New Deal can be dazzling, and we’ve seen a virtual explosion of debate across topics that will be discussed in the following pages.
But, then as now, the heart of the massive economic shift deemed necessary by the evidence from science is a shift away from financing fossil fuels, with an accompanying shift to financing of renewables. Any such shift of “massive” scale was always going to rock some politically influential boats, so an offensive aimed at defeating it was revved up full bore. At bottom, it has long been and still is a competitive scramble for money.
Before the Green New Deal: The Old Battle Informs the New
In fact, an attack against renewables was kicked into gear years ago, and the current anti-Green New Deal brouhaha is just a rehash of an old campaign to defend the capital and capitalists aligned around combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas.
For example, in 2013, a half dozen years before Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez signaled her support of the Sunrise Movement’s Green New Deal, David Robert’s excellent analysis for Grist spelled out that rooftop solar panels could compete against the coal-burning utilities, and that utility execs were openly admitting the risk to their profits, even to their industry .
With solar thus seen as a threat to the fossil fuel order, an offense against solar began at once, and the attacks spread to state legislatures all across the American landscape. By July 2017, the New York Times was reporting that “ Rooftop Solar Dims Under Pressure From Utility Lobbyists ”. The Time s described “a concerted and well-funded lobbying campaign by traditional utilities, which have been working in state capitals across the country to reverse incentives for homeowners to install solar panels.”
These attacks on solar soon extended to all renewable energy, predated the Green New Deal, were early warnings of the broader attacks we see now on the Green New Deal itself.
These same old attacks on renewables have continued for basically the same old reasons. As of February 19, 2019, the Energy and Policy Institute reported on direct attacks being led by the “coal and gas industries that fear competition from the booming renewable energy industry.”
So, in a way, nothing has changed. It’s still the same old big, energetic, even fierce campaign to defend fossil fuel capitalism from competition in the form of cleaner energy such as solar and wind. When this comes from politicians who typically pose as champions of competition, it’s a peculiar turn of events.
Since the Green New Deal: Same ol’ Battle soars to new levels
What’s new is that advocates of the Green New Deal take climate change more seriously than ever before, and this is rocking the coal, oil, gas capitalists’ boat like never before.
Concluding a lengthy discussion of what is actually some good news about the Green New Deal, The New Yorker’s staff writer John Cassidy says , “ The rollout of the Green New Deal may have been troubled, but it has started something.”
It’s certainly started fire under the long-complacent Democratic Party. The New York Times reported on March 4, 2019 that, Senate Democrats are preparing to “make combating climate change a central issue of their 2020 campaigns — a striking shift on an issue they have shied away from for the past decade.”
Capitalist v. Capitalist
Big Money is clearly at stake, as always. But now it comes with an added intrigue in the form of Big Money endangering lots of other Big Money, leaving the world of business increasingly sharply divided between fossil fuel capitalists and the rest of the capitalist world.
Big Fossil Fuel Money is fighting against necessity to keep fossil fuels in the ground, unsold, with potentially huge losses of income and profit for coal, oil, and natural gas. At the same time, other Big Money is at risk if fossil doesn’t stay sequestered where it is. The biggest risk here is in damage that storms, floods, and fires can do to tangible physical assets like dams, power lines, factories, resorts, homes — even to power plants dependent on fossil fuels.
A striking example of the potent new capitalist v. capitalist battle came on strong when the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change , a group of 415 investment firms managing combined assets worth more than twice the size of the entire Chinese economy, told governments to 1- back away from reliance on thermal coal, and 2- to give up subsidizing all fossil fuels, and 3- to get on with putting a price on carbon.
The net effect is that this vast mountain of capital is pushing in much the same general direction as the Green New Deal. Likewise, banks around the world are now backing away from financing the coal industry. Although definitely not a coordinated effort, this combined push is fundamental to the scale of action that scientists see as necessary to prevent dangerous changes forced on the atmosphere, oceans, land, living species and systems.
The jobs race: Labor’s big bungle
So, today’s attacks on the Green New Deal are grounded in the old rage against renewables — and their jobs. What we’re getting is not only a fight of capitalist v. capitalist, but a fight over jobs v. jobs.
This fight puts many Democrats between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
Democrats depend on the labor vote, but there’s a big problem here. As the Financial Times reported on March 10, 2019, “unions, which should support a plan that could put their members to work upgrading and retrofitting the nation’s housing stock and commercial buildings for the green era, are now complaining that the GND will be a job killer.”
This, Financial Times observed, “ highlights the fact that some in the US labour movement have been captured by the extractive industries. They are less focused on conversations about timing and transition to a lower carbon economy than in painting the proponents of GND as climate extremists.”
The Democrats’ dilemma is that the necessary economic shift requires a bust for fossil fuel jobs, and a corresponding boom for renewable industry jobs.
I’m always wary of booms, but a jobs boom in the realm of renewables is a boom we greatly need. As hasn’t always been true of other booms, this one has serious, important potential to leave the world a less-damaged, more comfortable, and safer place.
For sure, there’s a big and glaring need to protect fossil fuel capitalists’ rank and file employees as the necessary economic shift rolls on, but that needs emphasis on protecting people, not a specific set of jobs. Alas, when faced with the need to protect people, can’t-do politicians and can’t-do labor leaders alike line up to declare it can’t be done.
The name-calling game
The beginning of an actual shift from dirty to cleaner energy has the defenders of dirty energy scrambling. They’ve even stooped to name-calling, specifically blasting the Green New Deal as, shudder, a “socialist” scheme.
That tactic is more snark than substance, and it got a notable and important slapdown from Greg Ip, Capital Accounts columnist for The Wall Street Journal.
Ip criticized President Trump and others who’ve been hurling the socialism chant around as if it’s a weapon. As Ip sees it, “Taxing the rich, Medicare-for-all, and a Green New Deal that replaces fossil fuels with renewables are certainly liberal, probably radical, possibly unwise.
“But socialist? Hardly.” With that, Ip pulled a weapon straight out of Trump’s hands.
He goes on to argue that,“‘Socialism’ is, of course, a big tent, having at one point included Soviet communists and Scandinavian social democrats. Every country is a little bit socialist insofar as every government owns some productive assets.”
In a further reality check on the Green New Deal’s attackers, Ip adds that, ”If the federal government ends up financing significant expansion of renewable energy under a Green New Deal, it wouldn’t be unprecedented: it created the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1930s and the Interstate highway system in the 1950s because their social benefits didn’t lend themselves to private investment.”
The nationalistic right fires up its base by claiming that the Green New Deal is a direct threat to the American way because it is a government takeover — nationalization — of private industry. But Ip aptly points out that the Green New Deal is not about government takeover, a.k.a., nationalization of industry.
Alas, the irony of the capitalist media taking a weapon out of rightwing capitalists’ hands is likely to go unreported in the rightwing media, and Green New Deal advocates from the furthest reaches of the left are likely reluctant to credit anyone associated with the Wall Street Journal with getting anything right.
But there it is.
Who’s got realism?
Socialism snark aside, defenders of fossil fuel capitalism have said that Green New Deal advocates are simply “unrealistic.” Oh, really?
Again, it’s been capitalists stepping in to slap down that piece of nonsense.
Liam Denning, for example, has done stints as an investment banker, columnist for the Financial Times, and editor of one of The Wall Street Journal’s most closely-read columns — Heard on the Street.
Laying it on the line in writing for Bloomberg , Denning says, “The Green New Deal is unrealistic? Get real.” He concludes his slapdown with, “If the GND’s ambition is a testament to anything, it is that there are no easy solutions here. We have built our standard of living on forms of energy that we now know pose a threat to our very existence. That is a simple summation of a monumental challenge; one where time has eroded our margin for incremental action. No matter what you think of the specifics, or lack of them, this is a conversation that is long overdue – and necessarily begins with a shout, not a whisper.”
CO2 is actually good for you. How realistic is that?
Demonstrating the desperation of fossil fuel capitalists and their captive politicians in both parties, there’s lately even been a dusting off of an old argument of the now-defunct Greening Earth Society . The basic argument of this group was that carbon emissions, and therefore the coal, oil and gas industries are being falsely accused of harm. Actually, according to that old propaganda, because carbon taken from atmospheric CO2 is necessary to the growth of plants including trees and food crops, it’s a good thing, so hey, more of it is even better .
The claim that pushing CO2 levels to new heights was going to be a miracle for agriculture has been long-debunked, this time by scientists. For example, in 1992, Scientific American published “Plant Life in a CO2-rich World,” by Fahkri Bazaaz and Eric Fajer. One sentence from that article suggests a lot about what was known by then: “At first glance, elevated carbon diox­ide levels might seem an agricultural blessing.”
Bazaaz and Fajer go on to say, “According to the best scientific evidence, we see no reason to be sanguine,” and “Such an atmosphere will not help lessen the planet’s environ­mental and demographic woes.”
What it will do, they reported, is reduce nutrition of plant tissue, with implications for every animal that relies on plants for nutrition. Among other things, insects will have to devour more in order to stay even.
Bazaaz and Fajer concluded that, “It is clear that high COz levels will have wide-ranging consequences for the natural world. And it is clear that the COz fertilization effect does not guarantee a lush, green future of agri­cultural abundance.”
In its March 25, 2000 issue, eight years after the Scientific American article exposing the, ahem, unrealistic claims about CO2, Science News followed up with an excellent update on the stage of the science, “Greenhouse Gassed: carbon dioxide spells indigestion for food chains,” by Tina Hesman. Hesman interviewed researchers who found adverse effects on everything from caterpillars to domestic sheep. Her article closes with a researcher’s quip about who might be out chasing down wild ungulates with nutrient supplements.
On August 2, 2007, seven years after Hesman’s interviews with researchers, Nature ran another followup, “ The other greenhouse effect ”. Although scientists had by then concluded that there’s even more to the story than reduced protein, concern about “human health and the wider ecosystem” had persisted.
GND will destroy the economy — we can’t afford it!!!
What we can’t afford is the fossil fuel capitalism forcing the world into increasingly dangerous change. Without the massive economic shift to renewables, the economy is subject to becoming a shambles. Given that it also means risk of food crops in shambles, Depression era breadlines bereft of bread is a not-entirely-extreme scenario.
Two Federal Reserve analyses have joined a growing chorus of warnings about economic hard times if we keep dumping carbon to the atmosphere.
An August, 2018 analysis by a team with the Fed’s Richmond branch,” The Impact of Higher Temperatures on Economic Growth, ” cited reason to expect that economic growth, the Holy Grail of politicians, could dive by 30% as carbon emissions force the world into hotter times.That finding, however, is all hush-hush for politicians pimping promises of optimism. Some of these politicians, clearly, are just stone-cold ignorant. Others likely just don’t care, and yet others likely just sense that voters will shoot the messenger if they dare break the bad news.
Alas for politicians and lay public alike, the second Fed outlook on climate and the economy, “ Climate Change and the Federal Reserve ” has added weight to the bad news side of the climate-economy equation. Describing persistent failure to stop dumping carbon to the atmosphere as an “intergenerational and international market failure is so problematic that some economists doubt that a carbon tax alone would suffice. Instead, a comprehensive set of government policies may be required, including clean-energy and carbon-capture research and development incentives, energy efficiency standards, and low-carbon public investment.”
With these recommendations, the Fed begins to sound a lot like the Green New Deal.
But this second of two Fed reports doesn’t stop there. It lays out the risk that “climate-related financial risks could affect the economy through elevated credit spreads, greater precautionary saving, and, in the extreme, a financial crisis. There could also be direct effects in the form of larger and more frequent macroeconomic shocks associated with the infrastructure damage, agricultural losses, and commodity price spikes caused by the droughts, floods, and hurricanes amplified by climate change.”
Like the Green New Deal, this second Fed report is solidly based on evidence from the scientific record. As early as its first page, it reminds readers that, “ Indeed, as early as 1896, the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius showed that carbon emissions from human activities could cause global warming through a greenhouse effect. The underlying science is straightforward: Certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane, capture the sun’s heat that is reflected off the Earth’s surface, thus blocking that heat from escaping into space. These greenhouse gases act like a blanket around the earth holding in heat. As more fossil fuels are burned, the blanket gets thicker, and global average temperatures increase.”
Nothing is more basic to realism about climatonomics than that.
And then there’s that other big capital shift
On November 21, 1994, 15 years before The Wall Street Journal summarized the rationale for a Green New Deal, Business Week reported that, “The gap between high- and low-income families has widened steadily since about 1980, hitting a new high every year since 1985.”
This gap was another big capital shift, and it too was already in effect long before the Sunrise Movement the attention of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
It’s been a gap with some adverse consequences of its own, it’s been hiding in plain sight for the past two decades, and it’s long been too big to ignore.
In the early 1990s, the Wall Street Journal spun off a large, slick, color magazine, the since-discontinued Smart Money . Two of the Wall Street Journal’s senior writers, Alan Murray and Albert Hunt, co-authored a regular column there. In one column of that earlier era, Murray and Hunt wrote that if concentration of wealth/income inequality continued, it would one day trigger a reaction that would make the bloody French Revolution of the 1790s seem like a picnic outing.
Well, yes, and the anger behind this predicted reaction has likely played a role in both the popularity of Donald Trump and, at the same time, the popularity of the Green New Deal. As Freud phrased it decades ago, we’ve had a “common unhappiness” for a long time.
Long-simmering unhappiness over concentration of wealth is one of two major — and overlapping — factors behind the riots we’ve recently seen in France — and elsewhere. The other major force is the urban-rural divide, which is a function of governments’ policies that concentrate people and wealth in booming cities, leaving the countryside increasingly impoverished, including the shuttering of rural businesses as their customers move to the cities.
France’s Macron really blew it
For example, the carbon tax in France was the straw that broke the camel’s back in frustration over soaring inequality of wealth. The bottom line is that French President Macron blew it, and the Green New Deal doesn’t have to fear a carbon tax — unless it repeats his mistake.
First, following the example of America’s Trump, France’s Macron made the nation’s rich happy by slashing taxes for the well-off. That did not sit well across the rest of the nation. Then, having already created social tension, he imposed a carbon tax that rich could easily afford, but pinched the rest of France just hard enough to cause pain. At first, reports on the protests focused on the carbon tax, as if it was the sole cause. More recently, the media have begun to pick up on the major, overlapping factors, identifying yet another case history of socioeconomic warnings that have long been ignored.
In plain fact, if Macron had been paying attention, he could have avoided his lame mistake, because the warning had been issued — and the need of remedies identified. In his calm, careful March 27, 2017 “ How to make a carbon pricing system work ” Financial Times economics columnist Martin Wolf had spelled out just about everything Macron needed to know, and in time for Macron to learn it. For example, Wolf explicitly cited need to cushion a carbon price’s pinch on the poor who must drive to work.
WTF is MMT?
If anything has triggered more frothing at the mouth than the Green New Deal itself, it’s the uproar following Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’ comment that Modern Monetary Theory has a place in the conversation about it.
Prominent economists pounced at once. In its March 12, 2019 issue, The Economist told readers that “Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary now at Harvard University, recently called MMT the new ‘voodoo economics’, an insult formerly reserved for the notion that tax cuts pay for themselves”
Other economists quickly countered with a whoa, don’t be too quick to condemn. Giving some perspective to the debates, The Economist observed that, “These arguments are loud, sprawling and difficult to weigh up. They also speak volumes about macroeconomics.”
It turns out, according to The Economist’s perspective, that “MMT has its roots in deep doctrinal fissures” about macroeconomics dating back to the aftermath of the Great Depression, when “economists argued, sometimes bitterly, over how to build on the ideas of John Maynard Keynes, macroeconomics’ founding intellect.”
The Economist describes a long history of macroeconomic theory gaining influence, then waning only be replaced by a next new approach, and then that rendition pushed aside by a next version, which, in turn, disappoints. The Economist concludes that, “MMT is not obviously a step forward. But if it wins political support and influences policy only to flop, that is hardly voodoo. It is macroeconomics as usual.”
Where do we go from here?
Getting past the bitter old battle against renewables and now against the Green New Deal won’t be easy. Neither will the effort to right the wrongs of an economy rigged for the rich.
But something obviously has to happen, and the outlines of the shape it takes may not be clear for the next couple years. One thing is certain. The familiar old battle over fossil fuels is still with us, the push for some kind of Green New Deal isn’t going away, and the arguments are well worth having in a world at risk of growing hotter and hotter both physically and socially.
As I was polishing this article, I got the following email from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, publisher of Science:
The results are in.
+ Humans are causing—and have already caused—climate change.
+ We are running out of time to limit some of the worst effects.
+ Achieving these limits will require ‘rapid, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society,’ according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
So, what do we do now?
Broadly framed, we have two choices now. Either we get the rapid, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society that scientists and Green New Deal advocates are urging, or we get another, more costly, and decidedly unkinder kind of rapid, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society if we allow fossil fuel capitalism to defeat us."
Irritating Facts About Korea that Many in the West Would Rather Not Know,www.counterpunch.org,Joseph Essertier,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/irritating-facts-about-korea-that-many-in-the-west-would-rather-not-know/print/,"Photograph Source: Signal Corps Photo
A huge amount of work in the US as well as in Korea, north and south, went into laying the groundwork for a successful summit in Hanoi, Vietnam at the end of February, but Trump recklessly threw it all away, apparently following the advice of the unelected Chief Advisor and Peace-Wrecking-Ball John Bolton. Possible reasons for the collapse of the summit that have been suggested include that Trump did not prep because he is lazy, that there wasn’t enough time for Korean or American officials to prepare, that the aDemocrats got in the way, and that the meaning of the phrase “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” was not clear. In The Economist we read, “Mr Trump and his aides seem to have concluded that walking away will do less harm to America’s security than showering North Korea with concessions without gaining much in return.” Well, what they call “showering North Korea with concessions” is what peace-loving Americans would call “ending the War and laying the groundwork for reconciliation.”
There were various factors that contributed to the failure of the Summit, but there is one more major factor that deserves attention. That is that our country suffers from a certain kind of denialism—denialism in which people avoid the facts about our history on the Korean Peninsula. As schoolchildren and even as adults in the US we have been fed the “Disney version” of our nation’s history. (Paul Atwood explains this version of history and how it conflicts with reality in his War and Empire: The American Way of Life , 2010). In this version, there is a “collective hallucination that the US is the primary source of human progress.” We are taught about democracy and the ideal of self-determination but not about how whites and the US government systematically deprived Native Americans of their way of life. (Noam Chomsky gives shocking examples of how misinformed we are about the Native American genocide in his “ Genocide Denial with a Vengeance: Old and New Imperial Norms ,” 2010). The fact that freedom is treasured by Americans is emphasized, but we hear little about whites robbing freedom from people of African descent through slavery. We are told that people have the right to enjoy the fruits of their labor, but millions of wealth-generating American workers continue to live in dire poverty. Only by hiding gross injustices such as these, can the Disney version of US history maintain any credibility.
Without a full accounting of our past violence and an awareness of the reality that Our Country is addicted to war, it will be very difficult to build the kind of strong grassroots political will that would pressure Our Government to allow the ending of the Korean War .
“Denialism” is “when an entire segment of society, often struggling with the trauma of change, turns away from reality in favor of a more comfortable lie.” (I borrow this definition from Michael Specter, which is mentioned in the “ Firing Bullets of Data at Cozy Anti-Science ,” by Janet Maslin, New York Times , 4 November 2009). In the case of Korea, the trauma of change that Americans and others face is an end to the old Cold War in Northeast Asia and the possibility that Washington will no longer dominate the region in the future.
Breath-taking denialism surrounds US crimes against Koreans. During the Korean War, US government officials violated the principle of proportionality by ordering fire bombing raids, torture, and the destroying of dams and other civilian property in Korea. In the decades after the War, individual Americans perpetrated sexual violence in Korea. “Key leaders of Asian women’s movements,” including feminists from Okinawa, Japan, and the Philippines have documented how “U.S. military prostitution in Okinawa/Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines involve a complex ‘system’ of central and local government policies, political repression, economic inequalities and oppression of the underclass, police corruption, debt bondage of women by bar owners, in addition to pervasive sexist norms and attitudes in both the U.S. military and the respective Asian society.” (See Katharine H.S. Moon, “ Military Prostitution and the U.S. Military in Asia ,”). And sanctions sponsored by the government of the US and other countries have punished Korean civilians for the actions of their government—a violation of international law. If only people in the rich countries of the West (and Japan, too) could simply recognize and accept the facts of the wrongdoing committed against Koreans, perhaps someday we can reach a point where we, both our government and citizens, take some responsibility for the setback in peace talks in Hanoi, for the Korean War, for the separation of ten million people from their families, and for sex trafficking in Korea.
In the film “The Last Samurai,” US Army Captain Nathan Algren traumatically recalls his own participation in massacres of Native Americans and these massacres are compared to his violence against Japanese. The film is very inaccurate historically, but it is certainly productive and thought-provoking to draw such comparisons. Americans have massacred Japanese, Okinawans, and Koreans during the last century, and while the level of brutality may not reach the level of the genocide against Native American nations, there was a similar violent transgression of their rights to self-determination. Honest recognition of the wrongdoing on the part of the perpetrators is the first step towards reconciliation and peace.
Holding a Gun to the Head of Pyongyang
What a shock it must have been or will be for North Koreans when they hear that the head of state of their country was handed in Hanoi a piece of paper that called for “fully dismantling North Korea’s nuclear infrastructure, chemical and biological warfare program and related dual-use capabilities; and ballistic missiles, launchers, and associated facilities”! ( Japan Times , 31 March 2019, p. 4). Now we know that, in the end, Trump decided to go with Bolton’s “Libya model,” i.e., demanding full-on capitulation from the North Koreans.
Imagine: On the other side of the negotiating table sits the head of state of a country that has a population 13 times larger and a defense budget 150 times larger than yours, hundreds of military bases in your region from which they can strike you, portable military bases called “aircraft carriers,” one hundred times more numerous (and of course far more potent) nuclear missiles, tens of thousands of troops within a day’s drive of your southern border, and submarines equipped with thermonuclear warheads lurking at any moment who-knows-where along your long coastline. With a straight face, this man hands you a piece of paper with his ultimatum: You completely give up your nuclear deterrent as well as all your chemical and biological weapons programs—for Washington the term “denuclearization” now includes these other WMDs—while his country gets to keep all their nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and only they will have the right to continue to expand their stockpile of such weapons. You have to hand over your nukes with their fissile material, tell them where all your nukes are located, allow them to send inspectors into your country to study your facilities, dismantle all your nuclear facilities both old and new, and find new jobs for all your scientists and technicians who now work on nukes.
There is this assumption that North Korea must completely disarm first, even while Our leaders in Washington are in control of 6,800 nukes and have usurped the “power to dictate the odds of continued life on our planet,” in the words of Lee Butler, the former head of the US Strategic Command (STRATCOM), which controls nuclear weapons and strategy. Butler says they should be “trembling in the face of [their] folly.”
North Korea had been willing to bend over backwards for just a little sanctions relief—“relief” in the sense that prosperity will probably be short-lived and the economic suffering of North Korean workers will probably continue. Peace is to be on Washington’s terms. It is not hard to see the next step after Washington gets the peace it wants: Western (and Japanese) corporations walk in, snap up factories at bargain-basement prices, and start exploiting North Korean workers, not unlike what they did to working people in the southern part of the Peninsula after the 1997-98 Asian Financial Crisis when the IMF (International Monetary Fund) came in and “helped” South Koreans by organizing bailouts that benefited the private club of greedy multinational corporations.
Our Current Violence against Koreans
The US government is using our tax dollars to kill Koreans even now. The dominant narrative portrays Washington as a calm and gentle pussy cat, just sitting at the negotiating table waiting for North Korea to come back, while the barking wolves are Moscow, Beijing, and Pyongyang. Nothing could be further from the truth. Washington represents a pack of loud, barking wolves with fresh Korean blood dripping off their sharp fangs in anticipation of eating up the whole Korean Peninsula. On 4 September 2017 the Editorial Board of the Wall Street Journal actually openly recommended simply starving North Koreans to death in order to achieve regime change, in an article entitled “ Options for Removing Kim Jong Un ”.
Well, we may be starving them right now through our sanctions. The sanctions make it very difficult to get humanitarian aid into the country. Agencies must get special travel passports from the US State Department, as well as approvals from three other departments of the US government. Banks are loath to cooperate with the delivery of funds. There are delays in port clearances. According to Pierre Peron , a spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Bangkok, “With an estimated 11 million men, women and children lacking sufficient nutritious food, clean drinking water, or access to basic health and sanitation services,” North Korea received “less than half of the $111 million that international humanitarian agencies deemed necessary” . 190,000 of those people are kindergarten children who “did not receive food assistance last year due to the shortage of funds.”
Washington’s Constant Threats
A quick run-down of our many threats against North Korea would include Trump’s threat at the U.N. to “totally destroy” their country (again); our continued development of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons; and our mass production of other dangerous conventional weapons such as tiny robots invisible to the eye that can spy on and assassinate individuals through nanotechnology. When Our Country builds more nukes and tests them one after another at places such as Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, that threatens North Korea and their allies, such as Russia. There have been at least five ICBM test launches at Vandenberg just during the last year, when rapprochement between Washington and Pyongyang was achieved. They say this is routine, but the very fact that it is routine, that our government can do this without the slightest hint of criticism from our journalists, is worrisome to say the least, and downright shameful. Among scientists there is a consensus, forming or already formed, that a full nuclear exchange between two major nuclear powers such as the US and Russia would throw up so much ash into our atmosphere that a “nuclear winter” would result, causing the extinction of our species. In that sense, further nuclear weapons development threatens everyone, including North Koreans, as well as you and me. The US must jump on the disarmament bandwagon and sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons ( TPNW ).
In our names, without our approval, Washington has also sparked a new cold war, this time with China. (Michael T. Klare, “ War with China? It’s Already Under Way ,”). Klare argues that Washington and Beijing already have a kind of war going—one involving a trade war, a battle over technology, cyberwarfare, and diplomatic and military coercion (such as naval patrols and new “basing arrangements with local powers—all with the aim of confining the Chinese military to areas close to the mainland”). Since China is a traditional ally of Korea, North Korea’s security is also threatened.
Recently, Our Government has threatened a respected international judicial body, the International Criminal Court (ICC). Any judge who demands accountability among US government officials for Our War in Afghanistan will be subject to visa restrictions. The ICC is a “court of last resort,” and Washington wants to remove that last-chance ability of people to seek justice. This demonstrates once again that the US is a rogue state.
“The South and North today have agreed to remove every threat in all areas of the Korean Peninsula that can cause war,” President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has said. If only that were true! In fact, President Moon’s government has not taken steps to remove Our Bases that threaten people, both north and south, who live on the Korean Peninsula, not to mention the other threats above, such as South Korea’s nuclear “umbrella.” South Koreans will still feel the rogue’s “light hold on the jugular” of their necks and still smell the stench of his breath, even if President Moon’s immediate foreign policy goals vis-à-vis the North are accomplished. (The phrase “light hold on the jugular” comes from the American historian of Korea Bruce Cumings. This is the function of Our Bases in South Korea in his estimation. Not only do they intimidate countries in the north but also the government and people of South Korea).
Conclusion
This week in the United States, April 3rd will come and go with barely a comment by Our journalists. That date in 1948 is one which will live in infamy. John R. Hodge, the military governor of the occupying army called the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK) said in October 1947 that Jeju Island was “a truly communal area that is peacefully controlled by the People’s Committee without much Comintern influence.” Despite that dedication to democracy, or perhaps because of it, tens of thousands of the people on that island were murdered, soon after their uprising began on April 3rd. It was obvious that they would not vote the right way in the U.N.-“observed” elections—elections in which people in the north of the country were unable to participate. The USAMGIK began to ruthlessly crack down on people of a variety of political persuasions who did not approve of the concept of having two governments in Korea, one of them backed by a foreign government. The soldiers and police that were hired by Washington reminded many Koreans of the Empire of Japan that had brutally ruled them for a half century. In fact, Washington hired many of the same Korean police who had been hired by the previous empire—the same treacherous Koreans who had worked against the Korean resistance.
Our government’s responsibility is clear: “U.S. military leaders gave direct orders that initiated early Jeju 4.3 events [i.e., the massacre of agents of the “April 3 Uprising”]. This was followed by close U.S. oversight over the South Korean military and police suppression operations, including an order to kill anyone within five kilometers of the coastline. From August 1948, the U.S. military held continuous operational control over the South Korean police” and “supplied weapons, aircrafts and other resources.” (Chang Hoon Ko, “ Next Steps for 4.3 Reconciliation ”).
In those days, just after the US had emerged victorious in the Pacific War that had liberated many peoples in Northeast Asia from the Empire’s grip, and after Japanese government and laws had been liberalized by MacArthur, Washington still enjoyed a little moral legitimacy. Unlike then, nowadays Washington is Rogue State Number One, a menace to global peace and security. And contrary to what we have been indoctrinated to believe, Pyongyang has more than a little legitimacy. It is now a dynasty that has survived for seventy years. It was established by guerrillas who, especially in Manchuria, stood up against the Empire of Japan (in an era when the Empire had made non-violent resistance difficult to impossible). Pyongyang was defended by hundreds of thousands of Chinese during the next imperialist invasion, i.e., that of the United States. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was not a socialist paradise by any means, but in spite of constant harassment, a siege, and threats of another holocaust, it succeeded in some ways, especially in terms of social welfare programs that protected women, children, orphans, and workers. The South Koreans, for their part, have somehow managed to wrest away from Washington and Seoul a lot of democracy, perhaps today even more than we enjoy in the Land of the Free, in spite of the embrace with Washington that they are forced into. Washington dominates their military and manipulates their economy for the benefit of multinational corporations, whose stocks are held by parasitic, ridiculously wealthy people from the US and other countries.
Americans are in denial about the prospects of peace in Northeast Asia. We must recognize that the hard work has been done for us, by Koreans and other people of Northeast Asia. Everything is in place. All that is necessary now is for Washington to make some minor concessions to Pyongyang. Do we have the wherewithal to overcome Our Country’s denialism and push Washington to do the right thing?
The least we can do is reign in our government before we get ourselves caught up in more costly, senseless, wasteful violence. We have other, more important, things to do, than kill lots of innocent people and a few bad guys in faraway lands. How about working on slowing global warming and increasing the chance that our descendants will have a decent future on a livable planet? The fact that the military is far and away one of the greatest contributors to global warming should cause us to confront our self-inflicted blindness, i.e., our historical denialism. Listening to the voices of oppressed “others,” especially Koreans, will allow us to open our eyes to what we can and must do to build peace.

Social Media Regulation: Speak of the Devil and in Walks Zuck,www.counterpunch.org,Thomas Knapp,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/social-media-regulation-speak-of-the-devil-and-in-walks-zuck/print/,"In a recent column on the mating dance between Big Government and Big Tech, I noted that “Big Tech wants to be regulated by Big Governments because regulation makes it more difficult and expensive for new competitors to enter the market.”
Two days after I hit “publish” on that column, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called for government regulation of social media in a Washington Post op-ed.
Zuckerberg offers expansive arguments for regulating four areas of social media content, but those arguments are specious. My own claim as to his real reasons leers visibly over the shoulder of each argument he makes.
Zuckerberg’s first proposed regulatory area is “harmful content.” “Regulation,” he writes, “could set baselines for what’s prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum.”
Who’s best equipped to build such systems? Facebook, with assets of nearly $100 billion and annual revenues of $56 billion? Or a new site started by some middle class guy (or even an affluent Harvard student like Mark Zuckerberg 15 years ago) with a great idea and some spare time?
The second regulatory area is “protecting elections.” Zuckerberg: “Our systems would be more effective if regulation created common standards for verifying political actors. … We believe legislation should be updated to reflect the reality of the threats and set standards for the whole industry.”
Facebook, of course, has already invested billions in developing technology to identify users and advertisers and connect the two types of parties — all in-house. Most startups don’t have the money to develop their own such systems. They hook into a third party advertising service or a standardized ad sales plug-in. The effect — and the intent — of those “updates” would be to protect Facebook from those startups (and the American political establishment from its own would-be competitors).
“Third, effective privacy and data protection needs a globally harmonized framework. … it should establish a way to hold companies such as Facebook accountable by imposing sanctions when we make mistakes.”
Facebook can easily accommodate “sanctions” that would kill most potential competitors. It already has big bucks in the bank (unlike a new company that may be years away from turning a profit), and that “globally harmonized framework” will almost certainly be built around its own standards and practices.
Finally, “data portability. If you share data with one service, you should be able to move it to another.” What will the “standard data transfer format” Zuckerberg calls for look like? Existing formats for handling user data. Who handles the most user data now? You know who. New competitors will be forced to build systems like Facebook’s, and forbidden to try their own, possibly better, user data handling schemes.
The Internet’s potential is encapsulated in the expropriated Maoism “let a hundred flowers blossom.” Zuckerberg agrees, but only if each of those hundred flowers is cloned from a geranium grown in his proprietary nursery.
Regulation, not competition, is where monopolies come from. Facebook isn’t a monopoly yet, but Zuckerberg clearly wants to make it one."
Arctic Permafrost No Longer Freezes … Even in Winter,www.counterpunch.org,Robert Hunziker,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/arctic-permafrost-no-longer-freezes-even-in-winter/print/,"Photograph Source: Brocken Inaglory – CC BY-SA 3.0
Global warming is starting to hit hard like there’s no tomorrow, and at current rates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, there may not be a tomorrow, as emissions continue setting new records year-by-year, expected to hit a 62-year record in 2019. So much for the Paris 2015 climate agreement!
The most sensitive areas to global warming, (1) the Arctic (almost all of its multi-year ice, or old ice, is gone- already melted), and (2) East Antarctica, the coldest spot in the planet… strangely melting, and (3) Siberian ground that “no longer freezes in winter” are three occurrences that should keep world leaders up late into the night, blankly staring at the ceiling.
In fact, over the past couple of decades global warming has groomed ultra-dangerous climate upheavals that could destroy sizeable swaths of civilization. But how soon remains an open question?
Moreover, there are several ecosystem flashpoints with enough potential to massively destroy large segments of life right now, which, in fact, is already happening in real time, and scientifically documented, with nearly total loss of arthropods in the tropical rain forests of Mexico and Puerto Rico as a result of excessive global warming, which can destroy populations of arthropods by inhibiting reproduction and disorienting internal organ functionality ( Climate-Driven Declines in Arthropod Abundance Restructure a Rainforest Food Web , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences)
According to the scientists that conducted the 40-year rainforests studies in Mexico and Puerto Rico, rainforests temperatures exceeded the dreaded 2° C post-industrial guardrail (Maybe the IPCC is on to something by insisting the world must not allow temps to exceed 2° C, post-industrial).
Another ecosystem flash point of major concern is the failure of Arctic ground to freeze— even in the winter, in turn, exposing permafrost to thawing. This is unheard of, and it defies claims by many Republicans in Congress that say climate change/global warming is a hoax, or they often times fall back on the time-worn hackneyed statement: “The climate always changes.”
Albeit, failing to recognize the several ominous threats of global warming, especially now that the “ground cover protecting permafrost from thawing is not freezing in the Arctic wintertime” is comparable to applying for lifetime membership in the Flat Earth Society. After all, some things in life are so bloody obvious that denial is tantamount to imbecility or brainlessness, traits that are not DNA inclusive, rather symbolic of a deadness bordering on lunacy.
If not global warming, then what’s behind Arctic ground not freezing in the dead of winter, exposing permafrost to thaw, and East Antarctica, the world’s coldest spot, starting to melt?
In that regard, National Geographic ran a story a couple of months ago entitled: “Some Arctic Ground No Longer Freezing— Even in Winter” d/d August 20th, 2018.
Here’s a snippet: “Could a thaw of permafrost begin decades sooner than many people expect in some of the Arctic’s coldest, most carbon-rich regions, releasing trapped greenhouse gases (GHG) that could accelerate human-caused climate change?”
Ipso facto, signage needs to be posted in northern Siberia with big bold red lettering: “Caution… Area Subject to Massive Release of Greenhouse Gases and Runaway Global Warming!”
Still, smart-alecky people may query: Runaway Global Warming (RGW), so what? Answer: Check out Australia at year-end 2018 when all-time sustaining record temperatures brought the destruction of biblical proportions, melted highways, thousands of bats deathly falling in city streets, massive losses of fishes, and fruit that “cooked from the inside out.” Yes, believe it or not, cooked from the inside out! But, that’s only a sampler of what’s in store with full-scale planetary RGW. It’ll take one’s breath away… literally!
RGW is not outside the realm of possibility, according to National Geographic, there’s plenty of carbon trapped in permafrost: “Every winter across the Arctic, the top few inches or feet of soil and rich plant matter freezes up before thawing again in summer. Beneath this active layer of ground extending hundreds of feet deeper sits continuously frozen earth called permafrost, which, in places, has stayed frozen for millennia.”
But the ground cover for permafrost did not freeze-up in a region of the Arctic where temperatures typically dip to -40° F, and where permafrost has always remained frozen since time immemorial.
That same article goes on to describe some details about the discovery of ground cover for permafrost not freezing in winter: “The discovery has not been peer-reviewed or published and represents limited data from one spot in one year. But with measurements from another scientist nearby and one an ocean away appearing to support the Zimovs’ findings, some Arctic experts are weighing a troubling question: Could a thaw of permafrost begin decades sooner than many people expect in some of the Arctic’s coldest, most carbon-rich regions, releasing trapped greenhouse gases that could accelerate human-caused climate change?”
Is that how Runaway Global Warming starts? Probably!
Not only that, but throughout the Arctic, change is happening lightening fast in geological terms, e.g., 300 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Norway temperatures reached 90°F this past spring. In other words, the Arctic is cookin’.
Nearly a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere landmass sits on permafrost trapped in frozen soil that contains twice the amount of carbon that’s already in the atmosphere, which is a surefire deadly formula for trouble.
The jury is still out on the National Geographic article. Hopefully, it is not a major trend throughout the Arctic, but ominously, it’s popping up in other Arctic permafrost regions thousands of miles away.
To that point, thousands of miles from Siberia, Vladimir Romanovsky, a permafrost expert at the University of Alaska/Fairbanks found freeze-ups of permafrost shifting from mid-January to as late as March, happening since 2014.
Additionally, from National Geographic: “It’s worrisome,’ says Sue Natali, a permafrost expert, also with Woods Hole, who saw an active layer not re-freeze recently during a research trip to Alaska’s Yukon region. ‘When we see things happening that hasn’t happened in the lifetime of the scientists studying them, that should be a concern.”
The stakes in the Arctic are high. It’s common knowledge that if permafrost layers are consistently exposed to thawing, consequences can be hard, fast and not pleasant. Counter-intuitively, once it’s unfrozen, permafrost can potentially release GHG year-round, not only in summertime. And, that’s a huge problem without a solution, no solutions at all, unless well-beforehand Homo sapiens halt GHG emissions. No chance."
"If There's A Pee Tape, We Won't Get It From Jerry Nadler",crooksandliars.com,Frances Langum,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/if-theres-pee-tape-we-wont-get-it-jerry,"8 hours ago by Frances Langum Views:
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler was accused of being a hypocrite by the so-called president yesterday. Trump's claim is that Nadler didn't want the Clinton Starr Report released, but he does want the Mueller report released.
Ken Starr's report on Bill Clinton WAS released to Congress. And Robert Mueller's report must be released to Congress as well. This isn't about making anything public.
At this morning's committee hearing, Nadler corrected the record and proved that Trump is just muddying the waters again. Nadler didn't want Clinton sex acts released to the public. And he doesn't want TRUMP SEX ACTS released to the public, either, at least not from Congress.
So...no pee tapes, if they exist, will be released to the public by Jerry Nadler's committee.
This is some major shade delivered from the House Democrat. Transcript from the committee :
CHAIRMAN NADLER: Yesterday, the President presented me with the high honor of not one, but three separate mentions on Twitter. He also talked about our relationship, which goes back several years, in a press conference yesterday afternoon. President Trump seems to think, in 1998, I was opposed to the public release of the Starr report — and that he has caught me changing my mind on the subject. Let me set the record straight.
In 1998, the debate was not about Congress receiving evidence. Congress had already received the full, 445-page report and 17 boxes of additional documents, including grand jury material. We are owed that same opportunity today.
In 1998, the central debate was about the public release of some of the materials accompanying the Starr report — materials that Congress already had, and that described private sexual acts in lurid detail. Congress has no business broadcasting graphic accounts of the President’s sex life. It was inappropriate in 1998. It would be inappropriate today.
Our focus should be on the law. That is where our focus will remain so long as I am Chairman.
We are dealing now, not with the President’s private affairs, but with a sustained attack on the integrity of the republic by the President and his closest advisors. This Committee requires the full report and the underlying materials because it is our job, not the Attorney General’s, to determine whether or not President Trump has abused his office. ↓ Story continues below ↓
And we require the report because one day, one way or another, the country will move on from President Trump. We must make it harder for future presidents to behave this way. We need a full accounting of the President’s actions to do that work.
Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution. ""Congress has no business broadcasting graphic accounts of the President’s sex life. It was inappropriate in 1998. It would be inappropriate today."" pic.twitter.com/LPBMOMNF9W

The U.S.’ Refusal of Entry to Arnold August Is a Dangerous Precedent for All Activists,www.counterpunch.org,Alison Bodine,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/the-u-s-refusal-of-entry-to-arnold-august-is-a-dangerous-precedent-for-all-activists/print/,"On March 16, 2019, more than 1000 activists from across the U.S. gathered in Washington, DC for the “U.S Hands Off Venezuela!” demonstration. However, Canadian journalist Arnold August was not one of them – earlier in the day he was unjustly denied entry into the United States at U.S. Customs and Immigration in the Montreal Airport.
As August explained in a video posted on social media, after asking the U.S. border officials multiple times the reason for his denial of entry, he was told that he was denied entry due to previous arrests in Canada. This was in reference to his arrests at antiwar and labour protests in the 1970’s.
However, as August also stated, the U.S. border control authorities had been aware of these arrests during his other entries into the U.S.: “Previously they have delayed my departure into the U.S., where I missed a plane but finally left, and on other occasions let me go through, but never have they stopped me.”
So, the question is – why deny him entry now? What message is the U.S. government sending to independent journalists and activists by denying Arnold August’s democratic right to express his political views in support of the sovereignty of Venezuela at a peaceful demonstration?
Since the U.S./NATO invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the government of the U.S. has carried out continuous wars and occupations in parts of the Middle East and North Africa. In tandem with these wars abroad there has also been a concerning increase in the political targeting of journalists and activists in order to quell opposition to war and suppress voices of dissent. Subsequently, the U.S. border, where people crossing are already stripped of many fundamental human and democratic rights, has become an increasingly threatening and brutal place.
Today, the U.S. government is at war with Venezuela. In the last two months, they have escalated their illegal efforts to overthrow the democratically elected government of President Nicolás Maduro. This has included an attempted coup d’état led by U.S. sponsored Venezuelan legislator, Juan Guaidó. This coup attempt has been defeated in Venezuela by a committed network of community-based organizations, the armed forces, and hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who have been demonstrating in the streets against any illegal foreign intervention. Also, the dangerous provocations and news manipulations at Venezuela’s borders with Colombia and Brazil in the name of so-called humanitarian aid has not been successful. Together with the European Union, Canada, Switzerland, and Panama, the U.S. government has imposed crippling economic sanctions against the people of Venezuela.
It is no coincidence that August was refused entry into the United States while on his way to attend a protest demanding an end to U.S. war on Venezuela. The U.S. government is actively attempting to limit the reach of his dissenting voice, and send a signal to other like-minded people, that they too might be targeted. As August explained in an interview for this article, “I guess they didn’t like what I was doing with regards to Venezuela within the United States of America.”
Along with many other independent journalists, August has been advocating for an end to the U.S. war on Venezuela and exposing the misinformation and manipulations of the U.S. government and mainstream media pundits about Venezuela and President Maduro. His opposition to both the U.S. and Canadian policy of sanctions and aggression against this South American nation has been well publicized.
The red flag really goes up when you examine similar cases of U.S. and Canadian border officials politically targeting activists and journalists. There is a clear pattern of government attacks on fundamental human and democratic rights of people crossing borders to exercise their freedom of speech and assembly, as well as their right to dissent. These abuses have ranged from well-known political activists being harassed and “banned” at the border, to the denial of entry to groups of people to attend a peaceful protest or conference.
In fact, when I heard that Arnold August was stopped from entering the border, I immediately recalled my own two-year ban from Canada, which was imposed after I was politically targeted at the border in 2007 and questioned about my antiwar and social justice work.
Back in 2007, within a few months of my banning, Medea Benjamin and former United States Army Colonel Ann Wright, leading U.S. peace activists and organizers with Code Pink, were also targeted and denied entry into Canada. As Ann Wright explained in Common Dreams, “I had been denied entry to Canada twice in 2007 and Medea had been denied once in 2007. Canadian immigration told us that we were ineligible to enter Canada because of our arrests (not convictions, just arrests) for peaceful, non-violent protest Washington, DC in front of the White House and the US Congress; in New York at the US mission to the United Nations and the United Nations itself; in Crawford, Texas; and San Francisco, California.” Targeting them for exclusion set a dangerous precedent for the harassment of political activists, and people with dissenting views, on both sides of the U.S./Canada border.
Another notable case is that of Ilija Trojanow, a Bulgarian–German writer who was denied entry into the United States, without being given any reason. He is well-known for his writing in opposition to the National Security Administration (NSA). Trojanow was on his way to attend an academic conference. There is also recent precedent even for the targeting of people who are not well-known for their political views. For example, in 2017 there were multiple news stories about people being turned away from entering the United States from Canada while on route to the Women’s March for “planning to attend a ‘potentially violent rally’,” as reported in the Independent .
Since then, expanding cooperation between US and Canadian authorities at the US/Canada border has also been further exposed. As reported by the Guardian newspaper, in 2016, U.S. President Obama and Prime Minister Trudeau expanded an FBI “anti-terrorism” database called “Tuscan” that provides more than 680,000 names to every border guard. This is a database clothed in secrecy, and no doubt full of errors, akin to the “No Fly Lists” that the U.S. and Canada both continue to maintain.
There is also the recent case of harassment experienced by Code Pink activists Medea Benjamin and Ann Wright who were questioned at the airport by the FBI upon their return from a peace delegation to Iran. They were “greeted by FBI agents who had a whole dossier on us of what we did, which mostly they got from our own website, our blogs. But they also had a packet of information for us about the sanctions on Iran, the U.S. government policies towards Iran, the issue about registering as a foreign agent, indictment of Iranian groups to scare us away from talking to them,” as reported to Real News.
These exclusions constitute a slippery slope towards limiting our democratic rights to organize and express political views peacefully. In 2014, the New York Times reported that “A past arrest or conviction — even a public admission of illegal activity — can be grounds for inadmissibility. So can political activism or the impression that a traveler is visiting on business without obtaining a work visa.”
From the “Muslim ban” and the brutal crackdown on refugees and asylum seekers attempting to enter the United States, to continuous targeting of people at the borders due to their skin colour, religion or country of origin, both the U.S. and Canada’s borders are increasingly becoming zones free of respect for human and democratic rights or international law.
As the U.S. government ramps up its war against the people of Venezuela, our united actions across the U.S. and Canada border, such as rallies and conferences, are more important than ever before. When Arnold August was refused entry into the United States, it was an attack against the human and democratic right to express dissenting views, organize and gather in opposition to the United States sanctions and war against Venezuela, and to share reports on what is happening in Venezuela today.
When it comes to how to support Arnold August following his political targeting at the U.S. border – he had a clear response: “I would say that the most important thing is not to support me, but rather to support the Bolivarian revolution, support the cause of Venezuela’s right to self-determination.”
With regard to August’s commitment to continue supporting Venezuela against U.S. war, he said, “Of course, I will continue to write on Venezuela. In fact, I would say that I am even more determined to tell the truth about Venezuela, to support the Bolivarian revolution, to support Cuba.”
The practice by the US and Canadian governments of refusing entry of those who express dissent from official policy erodes our democratic rights both at and beyond the border. By reducing the parameters of acceptable debate, this practice of excluding other points of view poses a serious curtailment of free speech and assembly not just for activists, but for everyone engaged in debate on the most urgent issues of our day.

A Neoliberal “Wall of Values”,www.counterpunch.org,Serge Halimi,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/a-neoliberal-wall-of-values/print/,"The far right’s strong performance in elections was for decades an insurance policy for left- and right-wing neoliberals: any moderate, no matter how bland, could easily get elected provided he stood against a political party widely perceived as unacceptable and offensive. Jean-Marie Le Pen’s share of the vote in the 2002 French presidential election did not grow significantly between the first and second rounds (16.8% to 17.8%), but Jacques Chirac’s surged from 19.8% to 82.2%. Emmanuel Macron won in a similar, though less spectacular, fashion in 2017.
Neoliberals hope that what worked with the far right will work with the left. To block any progress it might make, they are trying to build a ‘wall of values’ that will make the left suspect. They hope this will force people who can no longer bear the government’s policies to put up with them, because they will deem those of its most powerful adversaries even worse.
As if by chance, the left has been accused of antisemitism simultaneously in France, the UK and the US. Once a target is selected, all one need do is find a clumsy, outrageous or contemptible opinion expressed, say on Facebook or Twitter, by a member of the political movement one intends to discredit (the UK Labour party has more than 500,000 members). Then the media take over. One can also destroy an opponent by pretending they have expressed antisemitic prejudices they do not hold — such as ‘democracy/journalism/the financial sector is controlled by Jews’ — as soon as they criticise the oligarchy, the media or a bank.
Philosopher Alain Finkielkraut recently claimed that ‘If [Jeremy] Corbyn was in Downing Street, you could say that, for the first time since Hitler, an antisemite was leader of a European country’ ( 1 ). According to President Donald Trump the situation is just as bad in the US because, with the election of a number of leftwing militants to Congress, ‘The Democrats have become an anti-Israel party. They’ve become an anti-Jewish party.’ (He later said, ‘The Democrats hate Jewish people.’) Bernard-Henri Lévy has even dared to compare French journalist and leftist National Assembly member François Ruffin to Lucien Rebatet, author of the antisemitic pamphlet Les Décombres ; to Xavier Vallat, commissioner-general for Jewish affairs in Vichy France; and to Robert Brasillach, a Nazi collaborator executed after the liberation of France. Lévy, a professional defamer, claimed to detect in Ruffin a ‘conscious or unconscious echo of the style of Gringoire ’ ( 2 ), a magazine dripping with antisemitic hatred; its most notorious smear campaign drove a minister of the interwar leftwing Front Populaire government to suicide.
Jews have been murdered by antisemites in France and the US. This tragedy is now turned into an ideological weapon used by Trump, the Israeli government and mendacious intellectuals. If we must build a cordon sanitaire, let it protect us against those who purposely accuse their adversaries of an infamy of which they know they are innocent.

A Rare Win for Water Quality,www.counterpunch.org,George Ochenski,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/a-rare-win-for-water-quality/print/,"Run-off pipe at a paper mill. Photo: Jeffrey St. Clair.
Montana’s environment isn’t getting much help from the legislature, but thanks to a lawsuit filed by the Upper Missouri Waterkeeper group, the state is going to have to re-do its 20 year variance on acceptable discharge levels for the nutrients/pollutants nitrogen and phosphorus. Make no mistake, this is a definite win for Montana’s water quality at a time when our rivers and lakes are showing clear signs of stress from too many nutrients.
The lawsuit stems from a 2015 decision by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and accepted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set “base” levels for nitrogen and phosphorus to comply with the federal Clean Water Act. The primary point source for the nutrients is from wastewater treatment plants that discharge to state waters.
The problem, according to DEQ, is that it will require significant investment to upgrade treatment technologies to meet the new standards. Consequently, citing the economic impact required to achieve sufficient pollutant reductions, DEQ decided to let dischargers have up to 20 years to meet the more stringent base levels.
The problem, according to Waterkeepers, is that equates to potentially no progress on controlling the pollutants until the deadline is reached. Moreover, as we have seen far too many times in a number of other pollution issues, the deadline would likely be extended.
Ironically, the ruling comes hard on the heels of a recent article on the problems being experienced on our rivers and lakes from algae blooms, some of which are so toxic they can be lethal for humans, pets and livestock. Certainly anyone who has fished the world famous stretch of the Missouri River from Wolf Creek on down can readily attest to the vast amounts of aquatic weeds floating in the river in summer. These weeds grow profusely when fertilized — which is exactly what nitrogen and phosphorus do when dumped in water bodies.
Likewise, blue-green algae warnings were posted at a number of lakes last summer warning swimmers, anglers and campers to stay out of the water and keep their pets from drinking it. That’s pretty serious when you consider Montana is a headwaters state with its river and lake water originating in the high peaks of the Northern Rockies — and thus starts with some of the cleanest water in the nation.
While DEQ contends that reverse osmosis is the only current technology capable of meeting the new standards, the agency might want to revisit a law that’s been on the books since Ben Cohen, a visionary legislator from Whitefish, passed the local phosphorus detergent ban in the mid-80s. Cohen’s bill allows any county to implement a ban on detergents containing phosphorus, which then keeps the pollutant from entering the waste stream. The measure was passed primarily to protect Flathead Lake’s crystalline waters and has been responsible for keeping tons of phosphorus out of the lake in the decades since its implementation.
There’s absolutely no reason Montana shouldn’t have a statewide phosphorus detergent ban since there are plenty of excellent phosphorus-free detergents on the market. Until that happens, however, any county in the state can use the existing law to implement its own phosphorus detergent ban.
When you consider the amount of phosphorus entering our waterways from wastewater treatment plants and septic systems, we have a choice. The state can continue to make excuses and issue variances. Or we can take this simple, low-cost step to keep phosphorus out of the wastewater and give our world-famous rivers and lakes the protection they — and future generations — deserve."
Unnecessary Expansions: the Australian War Memorial,www.counterpunch.org,Binoy Kampmark,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/unnecessary-expansions-the-australian-war-memorial/print/,"War is not merely a matter of sowing death, much of it needless; it entails preserving a rationale to perpetuate it. The mistake often made about reading, consulting and listening to the harrowing tales of those who have perished in battle or those who survived them is to presume that these should not happen again. Politicians, generals and strategists are all in the game: the dead are merely a reminder that more blood must be shed. Weak, imprecise terms are thrown about by way of justification: they died so that we could be free. Forget the bungling, the bad faith, the expediency.
One ample manifestation of this distasteful indulgence is the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. This particular entity can hardly be said to be short of cash but was promised $498 million that would have gone to other starved national institutions. Half a billion is hardly a pittance, and the war memorial complex has been preparing since the announcement was made last year.
The proposal is meant to address a few points, some structural, others specific to narrative. (Wars are about stories, often distorted ones, especially when massaged by the State.) Spatial issues have become significant; Australia remains busy fighting the wars of others, and so finds itself running out of commemorative room. Officials feel that more should be made for a modern generation of fighters.
There is also push towards trendy digitisation, a pneumatic substitute that does wonders to hide rather than illuminate conflict; every site where Australians have fallen will have a display, termed Places of Pride. A focus on Australia’s more recent involvements will also be a priority. In the words of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, “It means the Australian War Memorial will be able to display more of their collection and proudly tell the stories from recent years in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Solomon Islands and East Timor.”
For Australian War Memorial director, Brendan Nelson, Australian military deployments from the Boer War, the First and Second World Wars, the Korean conflict and Vietnam were “largely told” in crowded confines. “Yet the service of 70,000 young Australians in the Middle East Area of operations of the past two decades currently covers only two percent of available space.”
No opposition was registered by Bill Shorten’s Labour Party to this excessive splurge. Sniffing the prospects of a future government portfolio, Shadow Minister for Veterans’ Affairs Amanda Rishworth stated her party’s unconditional approval of the bloated funding proposal to the defence forces. “Whatever political arguments we have in the chambers on either side of this room, both parties are […] united in our respect for your service.”
To be sure, there have been various Australians irritated and outraged by the measure. Last month, they decided, via The Honest History website , to add their signatures to a letter signed by 83 or so, 24 of which, for what it’s worth, have received the Order of Australia. Thomas Keneally has been traditionally indignant at the proposed folly, as have other authors. But the opposition has not merely come from scribes and wordsmiths who might be accused of progressive tendencies. There is an air of protesting officialdom about many of them. Paul Barrett, former Department of Defence secretary, is a signatory, as is Brendon Kelson and Liam Hanna, former director and assistant directors of the AWM.
Nelson’s sins have been those of zeal wedded to money. He, the signatories accuse, tout “the Memorial as telling ‘our story’” yet show “excessive veneration of the Anzac story”. This denied “the richness of our history.” There was also an element of plain old vandalism about the whole matter. “His and his Council’s ambitions will destroy the Memorial’s character and entail the demolition of Anzac Hall, opened in 2001 and winner of the 2005 Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture.”
The voices generally tread the line of fine logic. ANU history academic Frank Bongiorno is unconvinced by the heralded role a ballooning war memorial is meant to have. “The AWM is already a very large institution, and I don’t buy into a lot of the discussion about the AWM having a therapeutic role in relation to healing returned service personnel as a justification for this. The notion you have to spend a half-a-billion to play that role appropriately and functionally just doesn’t seem plausible to me.”
Of the political parties, only the Greens have offered some measure of sense, though these do take aim at the more patriotic sensibilities of the war crazed. Arms manufacturer sponsorship, for instance, should end; the Frontier Wars and the Tent Embassy should be commemorated and recognised.
While valuing the War Memorial, Senator Richard Di Natale suggested that the expansion “to showcase military hardware is deeply inappropriate, especially when our other National Institutions don’t have the funds to repair their leaky roofs.” Australia’s National Institutions, reminded former Greens Senator and leader Christine Milne, spoke of the corrosion caused by the “efficiency dividends” principle to Australia’s National Institutions. The sacred will have an endless money pot.
Selling war and its merits has been the crass way states have done so for centuries and Australia’s inflated expenditure in the name of remembering the dead exceeds that of other states by some margin. Memorials should be a reminder of loss and warning; they have become, instead, the means by which the apologetics for conflicts past, present and future can be promoted. The redirection of funds to the AWM says much about the priorities of the Morrison government, supported, as it were, by the Labor opposition: the war complex needs feeding, even as the roof of the National Gallery of Australia leaks."
The Greatest Projects I Never Made,www.counterpunch.org,Ted Rall,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/the-greatest-projects-i-never-made/print/,"Two weeks ago I discussed some of the projects and jobs that, for whatever reason, I never got to do during my career as a cartoonist and writer. The stuff we don’t do, I wrote, defines as much as what we do. This week: my weird stuff that never came together.
Hugh Hefner died in 2017. I was un-sad.
Un-sad is not happiness. It’s feeling neutral when you’re supposed to be unhappy. Hef, who as a young man wanted to be a cartoonist , had bad taste in cartoons and architecture but superb taste in art directors. In the 1990s his charismatic cartoon editor Michelle Urry recruited me to help modernize Playboy ’s graphics, whose content and aesthetics were stuck in the 1960s the way The New Yorker looks like it’s still the 1920s. Under Urry’s tutelage I drew scores of sex-themed cartoons with a left-wing social and political bent. I think they were some of the funniest stuff I’ve ever done.
“I love them but Hef hates them,” Michelle told me. “He wants to leave everything the same.” So no commie sex comix. Sadly for real, Urry died prematurely .
One of my oddest aborted projects was a comic strip in which I partnered with another cartoonist to whom I will grant anonymity. Conceived over planter’s punches at a defunct Village bar called the Dew Drop Inn and marketed to alternative and underground newspapers under a pseudonym, “Lil’ Adolf and His Friend Eva” featured the antics of two kids in an American high school facing situations à la Archie and Jughead (drawn a bit like that) with a twist: neither knows they’re clones of a certain German Chancellor and his girlfriend Eva Braun. Faced with a dilemma—homework, bullying, getting picked last in gym class—the pair inevitably resorts to violence. I often decry newspaper editors as a band of boring middlebrow risk-averse Babbitts but in this case I applaud their discretion. Not one paper expressed interest in “Lil’ Adolf.” I am grateful.
My UPN fiasco left a few scars. In 1998 or 1999 Dean Valentine , head of the now-forgotten TV network that aired the “Dilbert” TV show, asked me to develop an animated series to follow “Dilbert” at 8:30 pm. Valentine had seen my cartoons in the Los Angeles Times . While the lawyers hashed out the deal I toiled over plots and character designs. The result would be a show called “Boomerang.”
Whereas “The Simpsons” is about a nuclear family in the suburbs, “Boomerang” would concern a postmodern extended tangled yarnball of relationships between half/stepsiblings and their LGBTQA partners and adopted children and pets living in a sprawling dilapidated Victorian hulk in Newark reflective of America’s splintering socioeconomic infrastructure. Very Gen X.
Six months or so into it, the deal was finalized. I signed a stack of contracts. My lawyer shoved them into a FedEx. And we never heard from UPN again. We called and called…no reply.
Ghosted by a corporation! Now it’s standard business practice. Twenty years ago, though, neither me nor my attorney had ever heard of such a thing. We could have sued for breach of (half-signed?) contract and perhaps won. But I wanted to do another show someday and didn’t want to get blackballed by Hollywood companies.
Two of my TV show pitches attracted high-level interest in Tinseltown, though not as close to those execution copies of contacts at UPN. Aside from the glory, I would have wanted to watch them. That’s my test for cartoons, books, podcasts, whatever I make. If I were a fan, would I want to consume it myself?
“Green”’s premise was simple: if the planet is in danger, if ecocidal maniacs are causing climate change, mass extinctions and possibly the end of the human race , isn’t the right thing to do to murder the bastards? “Green” the series would have been about a “deep green” terrorist organization—think Earth First! meets the Weather Underground if WU had had more members—and a FBI counterterrorist taskforce assigned to find and stop them. I saw it as a political, existential HBO-type show starring brilliant, troubled lead characters.
I scored repeat pitch meetings with Hollywood production companies and a few networks. But interest waned. Calls were no longer returned.
Shortly after the 2000 election I shopped a treatment for “The Bushies,” an animated series about the then-First Family in which all the characters were secretly different than their public personas. In “The Bushies” George W. Bush was a brilliant, soulful intellectual. Cheney was a mushy crybaby. The Bush twins were nefarious serial killers. Like many other L.A. dreams, “The Bushies” died in a major network’s “business affairs” department because some idiot lawyer worried about libel suits.
The Bushies were public figures, as public as could be. This was classic political satire, immune from litigation assuming a Bush was dumb enough to sue. Most countries (France, Germany, England, Russia) had similar comedies mocking their leaders. As usual, the in-house attorney won. Trey Parker and Matt Stone moved quickly with their “That’s My Bush!” for Comedy Central. It was not one of their finer resume entries.
Later in the decade I tried to jumpstart a political animation career with five-minute shorts. I drew and wrote; David Essman animated. We did 35 of them in all . Some still hold up, all are worth watching (the Tea Party one is great), but despite my aggressive marketing campaign I couldn’t sell them to anyone. It’s sad: static political cartooning is dead, Internet companies are obsessed with video but no one wants animated cartoons. My political cartoonist colleagues have had similar lousy results.
One of my most ambitious projects got killed by 9/11.
Less than an hour before the first plane hit the World Trade Center, my train left New York’s Penn Station for Philadelphia. By the time me and my business partner, now a magazine editor, arrived in Philly the Parks Police were shutting down the Liberty Bell. (My first post-9/11 joke: “don’t worry, it’s already broken.”)
We were in Philly to close a $1.5 million deal with a Pennsylvania media investor in Brooklyn Weekly , the alt weekly newspaper we wanted to launch in the borough. At the time Brooklyn still being hipsterized. The 19 hijackers messed it up. As we watched the events on TV the moneyman leaned back into his seat. “Deal’s off,” he announced as he wrote off the nation’s biggest city. “No one will ever do business in New York again.”
“With all due respect,” I replied with nothing-to-lose bravado, “that’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. They still do business in Hiroshima .”
Osama bin Laden may have done me a favor. Craigslist destroyed the classified ads business that were the basis of the alt-weekly profit model. The dot-com crash pushed the economy into a slump that lasted the rest of the decade . Brooklyn Weekly might been doomed.
Or maybe not. Brooklyn is different. I could easily see a weekly with a strong political and cultural point of view succeeding now."
Wagging the Dog in Rhode Island,www.counterpunch.org,Steven F. Forleo,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/wagging-the-dog-in-rhode-island/print/,"Another Raimondo Tale
Ever since Gina Raimondo, (a republican in any other state), became governor of Rhode Island, she has unabashedly launched a political coup on our lone community college. She continues to exclude faculty from her pie-in-the-sky Rhode Island Promise free tuition escapade while simultaneously allowing hand-picked business types on her “higher education” board to use CCRI as some kind of educational experiment.
Past As Prologue
I warned all Rhode Islanders back in 2016 that CCRI was about to undergo a political takeover by a highly ambitious governor.
In late 2018 I raised the issue of the dawning of the administrative aristocracy at CCRI, even informing the state that a political coup is in full swing due to inexperienced administrators, a CPSE consisting of hand-picked commerce types rubber-stamping edicts from on high, and a governor insistent on using the “people’s” college as her very own experimental laboratory to promote her political opportunism.
Down By Law
So, we now see the culmination of the coup d’etat brought to you with this overreaching, dictatorial Article 11 in H5151presented in the budget by an overbearing governor.
Before I address a few contentious proposals from Hedge Funder-in-Chief, please allow me to remind you of CCRI’s enabling statute:
16-33.1-3. Award of degrees – Curriculum and government.
The board of governors, with the approval of the president and a committee of the faculty of the community college, shall award associate degrees, certificates, and diplomas and confer honors in the same manner as is customary in American junior colleges and community colleges. It shall also be the duty of the president and a committee of the faculty, with the approval of the board of governors, to arrange courses of study, prescribe any qualifications for the admission of students and any rules of study, exercise, discipline, and government as the president and committee may deem proper.
With that in mind, Article 11 points to the utter contempt the de-facto CCRI president has for the faculty at CCRI and for that time-tested legislative mandate.
Servant Economy 2.0
Article 11 of H5151, with Rhode Island Promise in tow, looks to legislate unilateral actions, continue and increase a taxpayer funded adventure, and totally obliterates faculty shared governance.
A daring and glaring attempt to subvert shared governance would be the governor’s high-handed declaration that colleges align degrees and certificates to workforce demand, and seeks to undermine and retrofit the CCRI mission by tethering academics to workforce development, transforming both CCRI and Rhode Island College into vocational depots.
Must be the gentrification of the “New Vocationalism”, courtesy of the ruling class.
Boola Boola!
Count’em Up
Moreover, Article 11 seeks to expand the free tuition experiment.
Has CCRI provided any raw data detailing its efficacy? And what about a full monetary accounting from CCRI for the previous millions lassoed from all of us?
Did the governor once again conveniently forget a strict income cap? Did the state get any assurances? How about a student contract to cover losses if any recipient taking free tuition in RI decides to skip town?
Did she mandate the tuition gift turns into a loan?
Nope.
Without an income cap, would the students this governor purports to help basically subsidize the wealthier families because RIP is last dollar in?
Did legislators ever get an analysis from CCRI denoting the cost of each “successful” student?
It would certainly assist the state know what percentage of low income students actually benefit from this program, no?
Is it cost of tuition or cost of college?
Is it educational or political?
Short Winter Daze
Article 11, proposed by Raimondo , audaciously seeks to legislate learning with the contentious J Term, or winter intersession. (This abbreviated session places students in a course running 3 hours a day for 12 days).
So now the executive branch wants to play landlord over curriculum AND scheduling?
If the governor gets her way it’d be another flagrant thumbing of the nose to CCRI faculty and students.
The CCRI faculty, with literally hundreds, if not thousands of years of collective higher education experience, loudly proclaimed how detrimental condensing courses would be. More importantly, expert faculty stated all developmental courses compressed into a 12 day delivery clearly does not benefit student learning.
The faculty also appealed to the media, picketed the college, and placed on record that none of those courses unilaterally imposed by CCRI administration were ever brought before Curriculum Review Committee.
As the state is aware, the one-sided action taken with J-Term by CCRI administrators led to only the second faculty vote of no confidence in CCRI history.
But who’s counting, right?
Well, obviously Raimondo is counting on you to cave to her imperial wishes of ceding plenary power to a college president and her own coterie of specially chosen “higher education” board appointees.
The same group of acolytes who ignored the 56 faculty-signed statement about the current president, and arrogantly refused to meet with faculty about their concerns.
Workforce Be With You
Finally in Article 11, you’ll read where the governor wants to continue to drive faculty autonomy toward Ethel and Lucy in the chocolate factory.
It’s actually very telling of her to attempt to instruct the legislative branch that her appointed “higher education” board will approve program reviews at each postsecondary institution where each must prioritize programs and courses of study based on the state’s workforce needs?
The colleges must also identify program expansion, consolidation, and closures based on that analysis?
Buh-bye, liberal arts.
In addition, the governor wants her hand-picked “higher education”pals to set standards for making course offerings…predictable, structured, and more flexible to meet student scheduling needs.
That’s akin to a group of business folks setting standards for the American Bar Association.
See, in the governor’s ruling class factory, she prefers to disrespect the curricula knowledge and scheduling expertise of highly educated faculty, while implementing a corporate one-size-fits-all assembly line delivery.
Like Trump, she just knows more than anyone else.
And like Trump, it’s all about customer satisfaction.
Student learning? Fahgettaboudit.
It’s easier to push students out like widgets than it is to actually educate critical thinkers who will eventually question the motives of certain politicians like her for wanting to take away their intellectual curiosity.
Is it teaching a subject or selling Raimondo Inc.?
Community or Corporate College?
What’s next, Goldman Sachs controlling all things academic?
The Bottom Line
If the R.I. legislature does not significantly edit and strike down serious chunks of Article 11 then students will forever be arduously paving a road for a job search not riding the career path toward lifelong learning.
And by dismantling faculty autonomy, and excluding the primary stakeholders, this is what’s constructed and brought before you.
All Gina Raimondo ever provides is nothing more than a controlled manipulation of regurgitated pablum. It’s really neoliberalism run amok.
Rhode Island deserves much better.
So does CCRI.
Steven F. Forleo is a concerned R.I. citizen and tenured faculty member at CCRI."
Population Bomb or Bomb the Population?,www.counterpunch.org,John Steppling,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/04/03/population-bomb-or-bomb-the-population/print/,"There will be, in the next generation or so, a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude, and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies, so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them, but will rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods. And this seems to be the final revolution”.
– Aldous Huxley, The Ultimate Revolution
Ending Militarism. Militarism in all its forms, from the prison-industrial complex to wars of occupation, is one of the most powerful obstacles to the achievement of reproductive, environmental and climate justice. Ending militarism is a point where our struggles can and should converge, where there are multiple overlaps. The list is long: Military toxins damage the environment and harm reproductive health. Militarism increases violence against women, racism and anti-immigration activities. Militarism robs resources from other social and environmental needs. War destroys ecosystems, livelihoods, and health and sanitation infrastructure. It is the biggest threatof all to sustainable social reproduction.

Eugenics was an American specialty. It inspired Hitler, and it was much studied and admired in the UK as well with support from H.G. Wells, GB Shaw, and Churchill. White supremacism is what drove colonial logic and practice and its still with us in the capitalist societies of the West, and things like mass incarceration are evidence of that. But it has also bled into other areas of study, and into the culture at large really. And one of the most pronounced expressions of the new eugenics (that claims not to be) are in the so called Population Bombers (named after Paul Erlich’s book).
But before getting to the *new* scientific racism of the Population Bombers, lets take a stroll down memory lane and visit the old scientific racism.
Since this is going to be a very truncated version of a complex and sadly extensive history, a good place to start might be Charles Benedict Davenport, the head of the American Breeders Association (ABA) which was started in Boston in 1903. And originally concerned with sweet peas, and not people. But they expanded to include a eugenics division in 1906 to, as Davenport put it… “emphasize the value of superior blood and the menace to society of inferior blood.” Membership was very prestigious. Alexander Graham Bell, and dozen presidents of major Universities, as well as scientists like Frederick Adams Woods, and Roswell H. Johnson. The legacy of Puritanism looms large here. As it does it most histories of the U.S.
Eugenics was immensely popular straight away. And while many literary types and faddists glommed onto the idea, the primary force behind Eugenics were outright racists like Woods, Davenport and Johnson. And the almost immediate trend for this discipline was toward birth control, and in particular sterilization. Now, the history of eugenics is fascinating and terrifying and I suggest reading Allan Chase’s seminal book The Legacy of Malthus, The Social Cost of New Scientific Racism . But I can only skim over some of this to lay the foundation for looking at the current Population Bombers. One item stuck me, and that was the very perfunctory training of young ladies from wealthy backgrounds who became ‘field workers’ for the new eugenics programs. In other words these young ladies after a few weeks study at Cold Spring Harbor, and Vineland, New Jersey, Training School for Feeble-minded Girls and Boys , venture forth into the cities and towns of America looking to identify signs of “criminalism, fecklessness, and those of bad blood. I mean what could go wrong, right?
There are so many trenchant details in this story, but before too long wiser scientific voices began to challenge Eugenics, and this pseudo science waned…a bit anyway. But lets just jump cut here to the Nazi death camps. That Hitler modeled his sterilization programs on those of California and that Nazi doctors were ruthlessly experimenting on children to determine their suitability or not for entry into the Reich, was enough to finally shut down talk of Eugenics, at least publically (Churchill never stopped enthusiastically defending it and he was likely far from alone in private gentlemen’s clubs, or at dinner parties.)
“The New Scientific Racism was soon to rise, like the Phoenix, from the flames which consumed the Old Scientific Racism that had lasted from Malthus to Hitler. Ironically, it was not by some new magic touchstone that the new scientific racism found the secret of eternal life, but in the basic myth that had formed the trunk on which Gobineau and Galton, Retzius and Spencer, Davenport, and Yerkes and East had added deadly new limbs after 1798. The mechanism of regeneration was, of course, the original Malthus myth, the pseudonatural “Law” that man’s ability to produce babies would always and forever be greater than his “finite” capacity to grow food. Therefore, unless the exploding human birth rates were slashed, our species faced famine and extinction. This “Law of Population” was purely a figment of Malthus’ imagination. Some seven decades before Malthus was born in 1766, the European Agricultural Revolution, “the greatest move forward in agriculture since neolithic times,” had proven—and continues to prove, abundantly, in our own times—that Malthus’ famous “Law” was a totally false description of the realities of food production and human reproduction on this planet. “
– Allan Chase, The Legacy of Malthus
The new scientific racism added pollution to the narrative. And indeed pollution was already a serious health issue. But the new population narrative simplified everything down to *People Pollute*. Period.
“As in the 1920’s, when the nation’s decent people were betrayed by their own education into accepting, as a scientific truth, the crude eugenic myth—”proven” by the civilian and Army IQ test scores—of “the decline in American intelligence,” and therefore decided to throw their support behind the anti-Italian, anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic immigration restriction demands of the old scientific racists, the contemporary effects were tragic. Some of the best-educated and best-intentioned people in our society began to wear People Pollute buttons on their lapels, and to become true believers and vigorous fellow travelers in the pseudo-environmental crusades of the new scientific racism.”
– Allan Chase (ibid)
After WW2, the re-ascension of eugenics might be seen to start with Hugh Moore…the Dixie Cup tycoon of the early 20th century. He was to become the patron and supporter of Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood. And with Guy Irving Burch and Elmer Pendell, authors of a very influential Human Breeding and Survival .
The shift was from earlier Eugenics rhetoric about purity of native stock was changing to one in which sterilization was a tool of enduring peace and freedom.
America has never not felt affinity with pseudo scientific justifications for racism. But lets quickly trace the various iterations of the overpopulation theme. And another watershed in the new scientific racism was William Vogt’s The Road to Survival . Vogt was openly disdainful of non-white races and enthusiastically suggested policies of mass sterilization and that any aid given to developing countries should be contingent upon forced contraception. In fact he, like Mencken, advocated paying the poor and those with prison records to be sterilized. One of Vogt’s most admiring readers was Paul Ehrlich, then a student at the University of Pennsylvania. The new drive for sterilization, for population control, was funded in large measure by Hugh Moore. He also, outside of an organizational framework, ran ads in major papers advocating for reduced population. As Chase writes…
“Under such organizational banners as the Hugh Moore Fund and the Campaign to Check the Population Explosion, the Moore crusade for some years took one- and two-page advertisements in The New York Times, the Washington Post, the Washington Star, Fortune, the Wall Street Journal, Harper’s, Saturday Review, and Time. { } A true disciple of Vogt’s, Moore looked to sexual sterilization as the ultimate solution to population problems that could not be resolved by less traumatic methods. When Moore took over the presidency of the nation’s leading sterilization society in 1964, Lader writes, the salesman-showman of population control insisted that it change its name from the prissy Human Betterment Association (née Birthright, Inc.) to the more meaningful Association for Voluntary Sterilization, Inc. Things began to happen in a big way. Moore “raised money to move the office to a midtown New York suite just off Fifth Avenue, and employed an experienced executive director and staff.”
Moore blamed new babies, unchecked copulation, for the rise in pollution from the automobile, then undergoing a giant spike in use and ownership. He carefully chose not to blame policies that nixed mass transit for urban centers, or plans for any alternative to gasoline driven travel. The popularity of Moore’s campaigns made its way to the inner circle of the Kennedy presidency, and later that of Johnson. And most significantly this neo-Malthusian sensibility (by way of Burch and Vogt) made its way to University campuses. And Paul Ehrlich, then a professor at Stanford, wrote The Population Bomb (1968). And it seemed just scientific enough, but still accessible, and it boiled down very complicated and dense political analysis into one phrase, borrowed from the Pogo comic strip… We have met the enemy and he is us . And it became the catch phrase for a movement. The enemy is us, the people. Not corporations or class exploitation, or industry or war. No, just people.
Nixon even joined in, participating in Earth Day 1970, a mere few days before the invasion of Cambodia (and during his continued brutal bombing campaign of that same country). Nixon, who called anti war protesters “bums”, and this all only weeks before the murder of four students at Kent State by the National Guard. The new Malthusian environmentalists (along with the World Health Organization) were embracing a simple construct that argued *people pollute, nothing else*. Just people, nothing more and nothing less. They were careful in their marketing to avoid the taint of the older eugenics connections, however.
“Underlying the close working relationship between America and Germany was the extensive financial support of American foundations for the establishment of eugenic research in Germany. The main support was the Rockefeller Foundation in New York. It financed the research of German racial hygienist Agnes Bluhm on heredity and alcoholism as early as 1920. Following a European tour by a Rockefeller official in December 1926, the Foundation began supporting other German eugenicists, including Herman Poll, Alfred Gorjahn, and Hans Nachtsheim. The Rockefeller Foundation played the central role in establishing and sponsoring major eugenic institutes in Germany, including the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Psychiatry and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, eugenics, and Human Heredity.”
– Stefan Kuhl, The Nazi Connection
“Like the original Law of Population of Malthus, the Gobineau Cult of the Nordic, and the eugenic myth of the Decline of American Intelligence, the simplistic dogmas of the new People Pollute movement addressed themselves to chimeras rather than realities. They also helped hide the real causes and biosocial effects of environmental degradation from many educated but scientifically naïve Americans. Finally, in the classic traditions of scientific racism, the snappy slogans of Zero Population Growth and other wings of the People Pollute movement succeeded in pinning the blame for environmental degradation on the backs of its primary victims-—the poor…”
– Allan Chase (ibid)
From the beginning of this post Ehrlich iteration (the one that has surfaced somewhere in the 90s) of environmentalism by way of Malthus, the imagery and focus tended toward the pastoral. The lakes and rivers, the songbirds and national parks, and not on improving the conditions of the poor crammed into those urban slums that were growing across the country. The poor were blamed, essentially, for threatening the holiday locations of the affluent classes. The poor were blamed for being, well, poor (and dirty and eating badly).
It is worth tracing the evolution that arrived at Ehrlich and the post Ehrlich thinkers. The Tragedy of the Commons , by Garrett Hardin, a prof at UCSB, became a sort of companion piece to The Population Bomb . And this California professor was clear that the human population question required a retro fit of our morality. He advocated zero population growth. Following on this came a slew of new neo Malthusian visionaries, Robert Ardrey and Dr. Shelden Reed among others. The new population control advocates all firmly placed the blame on the poor and their excessive sexuality. America has alway been Puritan and there is no way to over-emphasize that fact. Paul and William Paddock were also staunch Malthusians whose desire, as they stated, was “to make America great”. Hmmmm. All of these voices are white voices. Every single one. The discourse for depopulating the third world reads a lot like Mandingo by way of Mein Kampf.
The eugenics movement biggest success, and one that had far reaching implications, came in the person of Margaret Sanger. The infamous founder of Planned Parenthood, would serve as one of the key leaders of group of new “scientific” racists that operated under institutional cover, and under cover of altruistic motive. So to back track just a moment…
“Thus, even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy of controlled human breeding will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much is unthinkable may at least become thinkable.”
– Sir Julian Huxley, UNESCO: Its Purpose and Philosophy . 1948
Think Soylent Green.
“The most serious charge that can be brought against modern benevolence is that it encourages the perpetuation of defectives, delinquents and dependents. These are the most dangerous
elements in the world community, the most devastating curse on human progress and expression. Philanthropy is a gesture characteristic of modern business lavishing upon the unfit the profits extorted from the community at large. Looked at impartially, this compensatory generosity is in its final effect probably more dangerous, more dysgenic, more blighting than the initial practice of profiteering.”
– Margaret Sanger, The Pivot of Civilization , 1922
Like Vogt, like Hugh Moore, her patron, like Ehrlich and like Reed, Sanger was a voice for the normalising of white supremacist values and beliefs. All of these population bombers have one thing in common (besides being white) and that is a contempt, openly stated, for the poor and especially those with darker skin. Erlich was a staple on TV at the time (kind of the John Bolton of his day) and as his fame grew so his pronouncements became ever more openly racist.
Allan Chase wrote of Ehrlich….
As a moral philosopher, and as an open and blunt advocate of genocidal political policies such as the triage ploy developed by the Paddocks, Dr. Ehrlich has neither the intellectual and professional right, nor the moral authority, to speak for biology in particular and for the scientific community in general. Genocide remains genocide, whether advocated in a Munich beer hall in 1920 or in a Texas college auditorium in 1967—and neither the brown shirts of its earlier German advocates nor the graduate degrees and academic posts of its latter-day American proponents make it any less a political rather than a scholarly proposal.
So when today one hears certain dog whistle phrases….*carrying capacity*…that is pure Ehrlich. Dropping sterilization drugs into reservoirs for drinking water, or other such monstrous strategies and tactics were commonplace in the 70s. The pop bombers are mirror images of the anti communist neo cons in the Pentagon and State department. And both have most of the same goals.
And as Murray Bookchin pointed out ( The Population Myth , 2010) …
The importance of viewing demography in social terms becomes even more apparent when we ask: would the grow-or-die economy called capitalism really cease to plunder the planet even if the world’s population were reduced to a tenth of its present numbers? Would lumber companies, mining concerns, oil cartels, and agribusiness render redwood and Douglas fir forests safer for grizzly bears if — given capitalism’s need to accumulate and produce for their own sake — California’s population were reduced to one million people?
The answer to these questions is a categorical no. Vast bison herds were exerminated on the westem plains long before the plains were settled by farmers or used extensively by ranchers — indeed, when the American population barely exceeded some sixty million people. These great herds were not crowded out by human settlements, least of all by excessive population. We have yet to answer what constitutes the “carrying capacity” of the planet, just as we lack any certainty, given the present predatory economy, of what constitutes a strictly numerical balance between reduced human numbers and a given ecological area.
One of the problems today, when one tries to argue with the advocates of the Green New Deal, or with other population bombers (Chris Hedges is one, David Attenbourgh is one, and so is Bono) is that for Western whites, especially for citizens of the U.S., there is an almost uncanny pull in these draconian race purity proposals- and maybe that is the Puritan legacy, or maybe Manifest Destiny. But the U.S. has been waging war against the third world for sixty years or eighty, depending on how you count. Libya, Haiti, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, Rwanda, Uganda, Zaire, and on and on and on. Of course there were at least two white nations destroyed, the former Yugoslavia, and more recently Ukraine. But the drive is both anti communist AND racist. It is colonial and in part its useful to see how Israel is the perfect reflection of American values, only without as much pretense. Most US politicians would love to be able to say what Israeli politicians do. Admiration for fascism, suggestions for genocide and ethnic cleansing. Israel is the American ruling class with the mask torn off.
“Viewed from a distance of two decades later, the predictions made by many neo-Malthusians seem almost insanely ridiculous. We were warned, often in the mass media, that by the 1980s, for example, artificial islands in the oceans would be needed to accommodate the growing population densities on the continents. Our oil supplies, we were told with supreme certainty, would be completely depleted by the end of the century. Wars between starving peoples would ravage the planet, each nation seeking to plunder the hidden food stores of the others. By the late seventies, this “debate” took a welcome breather — but it has returned again in full bloom in the biological verbiage of ecology. Given the hysteria and the exaggerated “predictions” of earlier such “debates,” the tone today is a little calmer. But in some respects it is even more sinister.{ } But the most sinister feature about neo-Malthusianism is the extent to which it actively deflects us from dealing with the social origins of our ecological problems — indeed, the extent to which it places the blame for them on the victims of hunger rather than those who victimize them.”
– Murray Bookchin, The Population Myth , 2010
Even back in the early years of the Ehrlich cult, some saw the warning signs.
“We “are going to have to adopt some very tough foreign policy positions,” Ehrlich explains, and limiting our own families will let us do that “from a psychologically strong position … We must use our political power to push other countries into programs which combine agricultural development and population control.” Exactly what kind of power, or whether we would use it globally, or simply in countries which food shipments and “green revolutions” might save from starvation, is unclear. But he hints at a time when we might put temporary sterilants in food and water, while some of his more adventurous colleagues, no doubt impressed by pinpoint bombing in Southeast Asia, would spray whole populations from the air. If we’re so willing to napalm peasants to protect them from Communists, we could quite easily use a little sterilant spray to protect them from themselves.”
– Steven Weissman, Ramparts , 1970
Ian Angus, the sanest voice on this topic I think….wrote several years back ( Return of the Population Bombers, Climate & Capitalism, July 2012)…
“Populationist ideas are gaining traction in the environmental movement. A growing number of sincere activists are once again buying into the idea that overpopulation is destroying the earth, and that what’s needed is a radical reduction in birth rates.
Most populationists say they want voluntary birth control programs, but a growing number are calling for compulsory measures. In his best-selling book The World Without Us, liberal journalist Alan Weisman says the only way to save the Earth is to “Limit every human female on Earth capable of bearing children to one.”
Another prominent liberal writer, Chris Hedges, writes, “All efforts to staunch the effects of climate change are not going to work if we do not practice vigorous population control.”
In the recent book Deep Green Resistance, Derrick Jensen and his co-writers argue for direct action by small groups, aimed at destroying industry and agriculture and reducing the world’s human population by 90% or more.
And the famous British naturalist Sir David Attenborough’s tells us that “All environmental problems become harder, and ultimately impossible, to solve with ever more people.”
Attenborough is a patron of Optimum Population Trust, also known as Population Matters, an influential British group that uses environmental arguments to lobby for stopping immigration.”
This reasoning is so simplistic, so duplicitous and inane that one is hard pressed to know how to answer it. I mean population is not this thing, like water filling a tub. Thats first off. Second, fertility is dropping drastically and sperm counts for men, in the advanced nations of the West, is in free fall. Bookchin noted, perceptively, that there has been a shift in tone from the traditional Ehrlich era neo-Malthusians, to a new age Voodoo ecology in which the writing is acutely metaphorical…man as a cancer on the planet…or, *Gaia* etc. And this is a perceptive observation. My experience with trying to debate the subject of *overpopulation* {sic} is that I am met with a nearly religious or quasi mystical tone, one that Bookchin labled *eco theism*. And this is worth pondering. One of the reasons Zombie films (and all post apocalyptic narratives, really) are so popular and durable is that the audience WANTS the destruction of EVERYTHING. They harbor fantasy stories of starting over. Reconstruction dramas set in a sci fi style code — though tellingly none of them seem to ever seriously deal with sanitation. And clean water seems amazingly easy to find in these films and novels.
“The road to survival, therefore, does not lie in the neo-Malthusian prescriptions to eliminate surplus people, nor in birth control, but in the effort to make everybody on the face of the earth productive. Hunger and misery are not caused by the presence of too many people in the world, but rather by having few to produce and many to feed. The neo-Malthusian doctrine of a dehumanized economy, which preaches that the weak and the sick should be left to die, which would help the starving to die more quickly, and which even goes to the extreme of suggesting that medical and sanitary resources should not be made available to the more miserable populations – such policies merely reflect the mean and egotistical sentiments of people living well, terrified by the disquieting presence of those who are living badly.”
– Josue de Castro, The Geography of Hunger
There is also, alongside the racism, a decidedly misogynist element in population bombers of the current incarnation. One of the curious aspects of the arguments I have had on this topic is the oddly faux mystical defeatism of the bombers. They are awfully sanguine about their coming extinction. I have heard in every debate something along the lines of ‘well, capitalism isn’t going away any time soon’ or ‘we can’t wait around for your revolution’. Not only is this curiously passive and accepting of doom, but it’s also dishonest. People are lying to themselves on some level, though honestly its often hard to know the parameters of this dishonesty.But however that works, the new Population Bombers are providing a humanitarian justification for, what Weissman called, the old game of empire.
“Not only is the individual woman responsible for her own children’s emissions, but for her genetic offspring’s emissions far into the future! Missing from the equation is any notion that people are capable of effecting positive social and environmental change, and that the next generation could make the transition out of fossil fuels. It also places the onus on the individual, obscuring the role of capitalist systems of production, distribution and consumption in causing global warming.”
– Betsy Hartmann and Elizabeth Barajas-Román, The Population Bomb is Back With a Global Warming Twist
Social reproduction is crucial to understanding who gets to be healthy, who sick, who has access to water and who doesn’t. Numbers tell one none of that. But remember, the murder of activist and conservationist Berta Caceres, in Honduras, can be laid directly at the feet of loyal Democratic Party icon Hillary Clinton. And this is the same Democratic party that is trying to sell the New Green Deal.
Now, back in 1952 John D. Rockefeller organized a meeting of leading academics, public health experts, Planned Parenthood leaders, social scientists and demographers. At the end of three days or so there emerged a new organization dedicated to population issues (and sterilization!) — but the entire story is very much worth reading.. here.
It is important because to really understand the role of western Capital in the developing world, you have to dig into what the World Bank is doing, and where the Rockefeller’s put their money and focus. And where the western based NGOs choose to focus their energy.
Let me Quote: Weissman…
“With support in the White House and agreement among their friends (the trustworthy American managers in the international agencies), everything seems to favor the new interventionism of the big business internationalists. Everything, that is, except a new-found popular preference for non-intervention, or even isolation. But if overpopulation per se becomes the new scapegoat for the world’s ills, the current hesitations about intervention will fall away. Soon everyone, from the revolting taxpayer who wants to sterilize the Panther-ridden ghettos to the foreign aid addict, will line up behind the World Bank and the UN and join the great international crusade to control the world’s population. Let empire save the earth.”
Betsy Hartman and Elizabeth Barajas-Román (ibid) noted that ” Overconsumption by the rich has far more to do with global warming than the population growth of the poor. The few countries in the world where population growth rates remain high, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, have among the lowest carbon emissions per capita on the planet.”
And there are many other serious scientists that have called into question the Population Bombers logic…Fred Pearce is one here and a shorter overview of militarism and the environment.
And this interview with Betsy Hartman is very important.
There is an unfortunate attraction in the reductive neo Malthusianism of Ehrlich and his progeny. Even people I would never have suspected of being drawn into the new scientific racism of the population bombers seem unable or unwilling to examine the bigger picture, the role of Western capital, not just in terms of militarism, but also in the rather obvious strategies to depopulate certain demographics and to colonize resources. As I’ve said before, impartial expert is an oxymoron. One reads all manner of extreme predictions, most drawn in almost cartoon fashion but couched in this new grammar of eco-science. Or, more usually junk science. The legacy of eugenics is vastly under-appreciated and rendered opaque. Anywhere the US financial elite are sticking their fingers is a place where one might not want to lend support. And the same for this new eco-theism, one that ridicules any objection to their findings and beliefs. The real hubris in this topic resides on the side of the bombers. Questioning the new orthodoxy is anathema. And these tendencies are directly aligned with the new (ish) growing global fascism. The environmental problems are dire, but I worry far more about having to live life in an internment camp operated altruistically by the World Bank or Pentagon."
CT clamp unit which can send data remotely using a sim card?,www.edaboard.com,Javid.zare.s,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.edaboard.com/showthread.php?383453-CT-clamp-unit-which-can-send-data-remotely-using-a-sim-card,"1 CT clamp unit which can send data remotely using a sim card? I am working on a university project and I want to measure current through a cable. I want to view this data remotely and there wont be WiFi connectivity. So I assume the best solution is to use a Ct clamp and a data logger which is capable of sending data by using mobile data from a sim card? I don't need to view live stream of the data but just a daily report of power used each hour. I need to measure power up to 4kW at 240v so maximum current of 17A. Is there a single solution that can achieve this, or do I need separate data logger and CT clamp. I know a raspberry pi could do this for very cheap but i want as close to a plug and play solution as possible as i don't have much time. Total budget would be max £50 Thanks a lot"

US preparing economic aid for Venezuela in case Maduro leaves office,thehill.com,thoman@thehill.com (Brett Samuels ),04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/international/americas/437160-us-preparing-economic-aid-for-venezuela-in-case-maduro-leaves,"US preparing economic aid for Venezuela in case Maduro leaves office By Brett Samuels - 04/03/19 12:18 PM EDT
Donald John Trump Tim Ryan expected to announce bid for presidency this week: report Kushner's security clearance was denied due to concerns of foreign influence: report Morgan Ortagus named as new State Dept spokeswoman MORE 's top economic adviser said Wednesday that the administration is preparing a recovery package to boost the Venezuelan economy in the event that embattled President Nicolás Maduro gives up power.
Larry Kudlow, who leads the National Economic Council, told reporters he is working with other U.S. government agencies on a plan that would get financial assistance to the people of Venezuela quickly to boost the country's faltering economy. ADVERTISEMENT
""The restructuring plan would be a plan that would put cash into the country into the hands of the people who are starving,"" Kudlow said at a Christian Science Monitor event. ""And done in a way … using banks, iPhones, apps, many clever ways to get cash in.""
He added that the currency provided would be dollars initially, and not the Venezuelan currency of bolívars.
Kudlow said he's working with leaders in the Commerce Department, the Treasury Department and the National Security Council to plan for how to disburse food, cash and other resources into the country should Maduro give up power or be deposed.
""We have a lot of plans to revitalize the Venezuelan economy and to move very rapidly,"" he said.
The Trump administration has taken a series of steps to try and pressure Maduro to leave. Maduro has overseen a worsening economic and humanitarian crisis during his time as president.
The U.S. has imposed increasingly restrictive sanctions on Venezuela, and earlier this year led a coalition of nations in recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the country's legitimate president.
Trump and his advisers have not ruled out using military force in Venezuela, repeatedly telling reporters that ""all options"" are being considered."

The United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense is investigating a video of soldiers shooting at a poster of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, according to The Guardian.
The video, captioned “happy with that,” shows four soldiers with the U.K.’s 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, currently stationed in Afghanistan, firing at the poster at a target range in Kabul, according to the newspaper. ADVERTISEMENT
The guns appear to be simulation weapons, which are frequently used for target practice and fire a wax pellet rather than live ammunition, ministry sources told The Guardian.
“There are a number of different posters used as targets on that range, but the use of this poster obviously shows poor judgment,” the source told the newspaper.
“We are aware of a video circulating on social media,” a Ministry of Defense spokesperson told The Guardian. “This behavior is totally unacceptable and falls well below the high standards the army expects. A full investigation has been launched.”
Corbyn is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Theresa May Wednesday to discuss ongoing negotiations over a deal for Britain to leave the European Union. A spokesperson for May told The Guardian the video was “unacceptable” and that May was aware of its existence but had not yet seen it.
Trevor Coult, a former British soldier who circulated the video, has claimed it was faked, according to the publication. Most Popular "

House Judiciary Committee Votes To Authorize Subpoena Of Mueller Report – Talking Points Memo,talkingpointsmemo.com,Josh Kovensky,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/house-judiciary-committee-votes-to-authorize-subpoena-of-mueller-report,"House Judiciary Committee Votes To Authorize Subpoena Of Mueller Report Noam Galai/WireImage By Josh Kovensky April 3, 2019 10:26 am
The House Judiciary Committee voted Wednesday to authorize a subpoena for special counsel Robert Mueller’s full report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The resolution – approved along party lines in a 24-17 vote – okayed subpoenas for documents and testimony related to the full report, as well as subpoenas for White House employees that the committee suspects of having knowledge of alleged obstruction of justice by President Trump.
The subpoenas seek to give Congress access to a version of the special counsel’s report without redactions, as well as underlying evidence gathered by Mueller that led to the report’s creation.
During his opening statement, committee Chair Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) acknowledged that some of the requests may wind up in court.
“And if the department still refuses, then it should be up to a judge—not the President or his political appointee—to decide whether or not it is appropriate for the committee to review the complete record,” Nadler said.
Nadler said at the hearing that after authorization, he would not immediately send the subpoenas themselves, adding that he would give Barr “time to change his mind” about redacting the report before sending it to Congress.
In his opening statement, he invoked Congress’s role in the Watergate investigation. Nadler compared Attorney General Bill Barr’s statements that he intends to redact the Mueller report for “sensitive information” to attempts by the Nixon administration to keep evidence from Watergate out of public view.
Nadler noted that his committee has the same constitutional rights as the Watergate-era committees did, regardless of whether the special counsel regulations had changed in the intervening 45 years.
“We have reason to suspect this administration’s motives,” Nadler said. “The Mueller report probably isn’t the ‘total exoneration’ the President claims it to be.”
Subpoenas will go to the Justice Department, and to former White House counsel Donald McGahn, Trump campaign chairman Steven Bannon, former White House communications director Hope Hicks, former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and former deputy White House counsel Ann Donaldson.
Nadler had given Barr an April 2 deadline to provide Congress with the full Mueller report.
In a letter last week to Congress, Barr said that a redacted version of the report would be released to the public in mid-April.
Barr also wrote in the letter that he will redact grand jury information from the report, as well as material sensitive to national security, harmful information to unindicted third parties, and information relevant to other investigations.
Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) issued a broadside against Nadler and the process to access the report, saying it “commands the attorney general to do the unthinkable — break the law.”
Nadler reached back to the heady days of Ken Starr and his 445-page report, noting that Congress received both the report and underlying evidence without incident. The debate then, he argued, was over whether Congress would publicly disclose the underlying evidence – a separate issue from the committee’s current attempt to access unredacted versions of the evidence.
“The question now is not public release of information, but release to Congress to do its constitutional duties,” Nadler said. More Muckraker "

He said the recent decision taken by the Legal Profession Qualifying Board to recognise the UEC was only their opinion.
“If we want to recognise it, it is the government that must recognise,” he told reporters after chairing the PPBM Supreme Council meeting here tonight.
Mahathir is also the PPBM chairman.
Legal Profession Qualifying Board chairman Tommy Thomas, who is also the attorney-general, recently issued a statement saying the UEC qualification at the Senior Middle 3 level could be accepted as meeting the STPM examination requirement to sit for the Certificate in Legal Practice Examination from 2021.

Scientists develop wearable device that could offer biopsy alternative,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,AFP Relaxnews,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2019/04/04/scientists-develop-wearable-device-that-could-offer-biopsy-alternative/,"Scientists develop wearable device that could offer biopsy alternative By - April 4, 2019 12:00 AM In animal tests, the device trapped 3.5 times as many cancer cells per millilitre of blood as it did running blood draw samples. (AFPrelaxnews pic)
Doctors and engineers at the University of Michigan, USA, have developed a wearable device that can detect cancer by capturing and analysing cells present in the blood.
Biopsy is currently the most accurate means of diagnosing cancer. But, as Daniel F Hayes MD – senior author of the paper, published in Nature Communications – explains, “nobody wants to have a biopsy.”
A biopsy involves taking a sample of tissue for analysis under a microscope.
Most often, such procedures are carried out by needle, endoscopy or surgical incisions. The procedures may be unpleasant and often uncomfortable for patients.
In this latest research, Dr Hayes and his team explored a less invasive method of detecting cancer by studying the cells circulating in the blood.
Cancerous tumours release cells into the blood – more than 1,000 in just one minute – which means that it is theoretically possible to detect the presence of cancer by taking and analysing a sample of blood.
However, this technique is insufficient, since some blood draws come back with no cancer cells, even in patients with advanced cancer.
A promising new technique
The scientists developed a wearable device that is effectively able to “filter” the blood in order to detect cancer cells.
The device is able to continuously capture cancer cells in the blood directly from a patient’s vein, thus screening much larger volumes of blood than with a single draw.
“It’s the difference between having a security camera that takes a snapshot of a door every five minutes or takes a video. If an intruder enters between the snapshots, you wouldn’t know about it,” explains Sunitha Nagrath, PhD, associate professor of chemical engineering at the University of Michigan, who led the development of the device.
The device has currently only been tested in dogs, where it trapped 3.5 times as many cancer cells per millilitre of blood as it did running samples collected by blood draw.
Dr Hayes hopes that the device will begin human trials in three to five years.
As well as offering an alternative to biopsies, the MD explains that the device could also provide better information for planning treatments, by allowing doctors to see if the cancer cells are making the molecules that serve as targets for many newer cancer drugs. "
