Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker is not as exciting because the franchise never ends.,slate.com,Sam Adams,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/star-wars-nine-skywalker-trailer.html,"Tiger Woods Might’ve Just Pulled Off His Greatest Win Yet “No one’s ever really gone.” When Luke spoke those words to Leia in Star Wars: The Last Jedi , tears sprang to my eyes. The character’s warning to his sister about his imminent death doubled as a farewell to actress Carrie Fisher, who died after filming for the movie was complete. But when I heard those same words in the trailer for The Rise of Skywalker , the ninth and (for now) final installment in the generation-spanning series, my eyes rolled instead of misting up. It was a foregone conclusion that Luke, who died—or whatever it is one calls the disintegration of his corporeal form —would return in the last movie, just as Alec Guinness did after Obi-Wan was struck down in the first Star Wars . But the trailer confirms that despite Fisher’s death, Leia, too, will be back, thanks to unused footage from The Force Awakens . (Director J.J. Abrams reassured fans at Friday’s Star Wars Celebration that she will not appear as an uncanny digital doppelgänger as she did in Rogue One ). And though Disney CEO Robert Iger said that the Star Wars movies will enter “a bit of a hiatus” after the release of The Rise of Skywalker , he also announced that that the first episode of spinoff series The Mandalorian will be available on the company’s streaming service, Disney+, when it launches on Nov. 12, with another, yet-untitled series focusing on Rogue One ’s Cassian Andor to follow in 2021. More films and series, including a new trilogy from The Last Jedi ’s Rian Johnson, are purportedly on the way, fulfilling the promise of Adam Rogers’ Wired article, “ You Won’t Live to See the Final Star Wars Movie .” Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

Iger talks about the “hiatus” like it’s a silent moment of respect, but it’s more like a pit stop, a brief pause to kick the tires before getting back on the track and speeding around in circles. If you love Star Wars , as I sometimes do , this ought to be good news. You get a Star Wars , and you get a Star Wars , and you get a Star Wars ! But seeing the first live-action Star Wars TV show listed alongside the likes of High School Musical: The Music: The Series —a title that looks more like an old-school SAT question than a forthcoming Disney+ offering—makes it feels like just another brand extension, about as thrilling as a new variety of Snickers. Part of what made the Star Wars trilogies so exciting was their sheer improbability, but it’s now more difficult to imagine a world in which they stop churning out Star Wars content than one in which it goes on forever. I wish Solo had been better, but there’s a strange kind of relief in its relative failure , which proves that it’s possible for a Star Wars movie to be bad, or at least mediocre, enough to scuttle its clearly prepared-for sequel. When the new trilogy was announced, I was thrilled that my daughter would have a Star Wars to call her own. Now I hope that someday she’ll know a world without Star Wars —at least for long enough that the next time it comes back, it’ll be a surprise and not an inevitability. Support our journalism

"The Trump administration just settled a suit that could reunite 2,700 immigrant families.",slate.com,Dahlia Lithwick,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-administration-settled-central-american-minors-parole-program-lawsuit.html,"Fox’s Wallace Only “Comfortable” Playing Five Seconds of Trump’s “Horrible” Omar Video I n a week that opened with the White House “ cleaning house” at the Department of Homeland Security and ended with the president openly threatening to release detained immigrants into so-called sanctuary cities to “punish” his immigration reform foes, some good news has come in a major legal challenge to another secretive and “tough” immigration policy. On Friday afternoon, the government signed a settlement agreement in a massive class-action suit challenging the Trump administration’s termination of the little-known Central American Minors (CAM) parole program . As a result of that agreement, almost 3,000 vulnerable kids will have a chance to be reunited with their families in the United States. The Obama-era CAM program was created in 2014 , following news of a surge of tens of thousands of unaccompanied children fleeing violence in the Northern Triangle countries El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The initiative, intended to create a safe and lawful alternative to dangerous solo treks through Mexico, allowed lawful immigrants who lived in the U.S. to apply for refugee status on behalf of their children younger than 21 and certain eligible relatives. The secretary of homeland security was given case-by-case discretion to parole in foreign nationals for “urgent humanitarian reasons” or “significant public benefit” for those who perhaps didn’t meet the stringent definition of refugee but nevertheless merited consideration on the grounds of humanitarian relief. These eligibility determinations were made when the minors were still in their home countries so as to avoid dangerous solo travel via Mexico. Humanitarian parole would allow them to spend two years in the United States, without a pathway to citizenship. The program stuttered to a stop almost as soon as Donald Trump took office . In response, a lawsuit was brought in June on behalf of the families of 12 minors whose lives were in limbo as the program languished. The suit , filed by the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), one of the groups that first challenged the Trump administration’s travel ban, was on behalf of the more than 2,700 children who had already applied before the program was terminated but had received no answer. Many of these applicants had already gone through months or years of processing and had already been approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for relocation pending final medical and security checks. But the program was shuttered, first in secret, without any notice to the applicants, and then formally in August of 2017 with an unexplained mass rescission of conditional approval for parole status for nearly 3,000 children. Worse still, the plaintiffs alleged that USCIS had continued to accept money from applicant families—including $400 for DNA tests, $100 or more for medical exams, and $1,400 for each child’s plane ticket—long after the program had been decommissioned. In effect, they argued, the program was still taking applications on its website and accepting payments while rescinding everyone’s conditional approval en masse. This willingness to sign off on a settlement agreement suggests yet again that this border crisis is less about public safety than ugly political signaling. In December, a federal magistrate judge found that the cancellation of the program was illegal under the Administrative Procedure Act, which delineates how federal agencies propose and establish new regulations. Then, early last month, the same federal magistrate judge in San Francisco ordered the administration to restart the processing of CAM applications for those who had already been conditionally approved, finding that the government’s action was causing irreparable harm to the plaintiffs by preventing their children from escaping life-threatening danger. She gave the government until March 21 to begin processing these children at late stages of processing again and explicitly ordered that “DHS may not adopt any policy, procedure, or practice of not processing the beneficiaries or placing their processing on hold en masse” and “must process the beneficiaries in good faith.” On Friday afternoon, the Department of Homeland Security entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, in which USCIS now agrees to process the approximately 2,700 people who had been conditionally approved for parole prior to the CAM parole program’s termination and agrees to process them under the pre-termination standards. That means that, for the families who have been waiting for years to be reunified in the U.S. with children facing horrific danger and violence in Central America, at least the process of attempting to reunify now begins again. For S.A., the plaintiff whose name is on the IRAP lawsuit, that will finally mean the possibility of reunification with her daughter and small grandson. S.A. has lived lawfully in the U.S. since 2001 under a program designed to help citizens of countries experiencing armed conflict. She works for a lice-removal company in San Francisco. Her youngest daughter, who still lives in San Salvador, has been threatened with brutal gang violence. She and her baby son had been cleared in February of 2017 to travel to the United States and had paid nearly $5,000 for their flights, DNA tests, and other processing requirements at that time. Their approval was rescinded when the CAM program was canceled. Similarly situated teens in the lawsuit, fleeing from horrific gang violence and sexual abuse, will now at minimum see their applications processed as promised. For Linda Evarts, the attorney with IRAP who litigated this suit, the agreement with the Trump administration is an unalloyed win for reunification of families: “We are so pleased that after many years apart our clients will finally have the opportunity to reunite with each other in safety. These families belong together here in the United States, and we are hopeful this settlement will allow for their swift reunification.” Given the Trump administration’s current stance that holds that all migrants, but especially those from Central America, are de facto criminals and rapists and gang members, this willingness to sign off on a settlement agreement suggests yet again that this border crisis is less about public safety than ugly political signaling .

Candida auris: How do hospitals stop the spread of drug-resistant superbugs.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/candida-auris-hospitals-superbug-spread-prevention.html,"It’s Time for the Heroic Male Paleontologist Trope to Go Extinct On Saturday, the New York Times published a fascinating and anxiety-inducing article about the rise of an antifungal-resistant yeast called Candida auris in hospitals around the world. Patients with weakened immune systems are particularly susceptible, and once the fungus hits, infection spreads through their bloodstreams and causes fever and chills. Nearly half of people sickened by it die within 90 days, according to the Times, though it’s unclear if they are killed by the pathogen itself or by the diseases and conditions that landed them in the hospital in the first place. C. auris can also survive for weeks outside a patient—on sinks and mattresses, door knobs and bedside tables. To eradicate it after one patient died, a hospital in Brooklyn even “had to rip out some of the ceiling and floor tiles” in his room. How often do hospitals have to take such extreme steps to stop the spread of these drug-resistant superbugs? Fortunately, very rarely, but when they do, the steps required can be expensive and exacting. According to the CDC, hospitals can often manage outbreaks by simply paying more attention to cleaning the environment and equipment around a patient. Medical experts know how to kill pretty much everything we encounter with disinfectants. The hospital’s standard quaternary ammonium compound —a common antimicrobial cleaner that kills many bacteria, fungi, amoebas, and viruses—is used for everyday cleaning and works most of the time. For the viruses (such as noroviruses) and bacteria (such as the very-long-living Clostridioides difficile ) that survive, the hospital can use a bleach-based cleaner or other disinfectant known to kill specific organisms . The concern in infectious outbreaks is generally that we will encounter a strain of a familiar bacteria or fungus that has developed a drug resistance that makes it hard to kill once it’s settled in a patient’s body. Hospitals are, unfortunately, one place a patient is more likely to encounter an antibiotic-resistant strain of something. They are, after all, where a large amount of antibiotics are used. That becomes particularly troublesome when paired with the long life span and sturdiness displayed by hardier microbes such as C. auris and C. difficile. While most pathogens die when left without a host, these can survive for weeks or months. When hospitals know they have encountered an infection that can jump easily from patient to patient, they take crisis-level precautions. They isolate patients and prevent staff who treat them from caring for others. They hold meetings for medical and cleaning staff to train them on the specific rules for the specific microbe. They require visitors and staff to don gloves, gowns, and masks while in the patients’ rooms and become extra vigilant about ensuring no one leaves without washing their hands. (Thorough and careful hand-washing can go a long way to keeping pathogens from running amok.) Depending on the type of contaminant, they may also place patients in a ventilated room that doesn’t allow air to circulate into the rest of the hospital. In extreme circumstances, like this C. auris outbreak, hospitals may be forced to tear apart rooms to get to where the microorganisms may be living. Typically, hospitals are only forced to discard more easily movable objects: infected mattresses or linens (as in a particularly tragic outbreak of Mycobacterium abscessus in a New Orleans pediatric hospital) or tools and other smaller sources of infection. In one case in the 1970s, a green liquid soap used to clean skin for IV insertions had been contaminated with the bacteria Pseudomonas stutzeri . In a much more recent case, the Food and Drug Administration traced two types of fungi, including Aspergillus , the most common cause of fatal fungal infections, to drug vials given to six patients in an experimental study. It’s not unheard of for a hospital to have to tackle plumbing more aggressively. Especially in older buildings, bacteria cling to and flourish in sinks and pipes. When three people died in an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease at the University of Wisconsin’s hospital in Madison last year, the hospital found the bacteria in its pipes and, like others in the same situation, simply pumped chlorine into the water. In other cases, the pipes have to be ripped out for testing and sanitizing. Recently, the staff at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, experimented with reducing the amount of bacteria that can grow in a water system by “literally taking out plumbing and putting it in a different shape .” One of the most extreme responses to an outbreak occurred at that same hospital, during a 2011 outbreak of an antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase , or KPC , a bacterium that can, like C. auris , cause infections in blood streams or wounds, leading to fevers, chills, a bloody cough, and eventually organ failure. Patients began testing positive for serious infections at a rate of around one per week, and standard cleaning failed to stop the spread. The hospital staff tore apart the plumbing in some rooms to remove sink drains where they found the bacteria lurking. They also used a robot to spray hydrogen peroxide in those emptied-out rooms after patients were moved to a separate ICU. (According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this technique has not been tested and proven effective and is therefore only recommended as an extra precaution after scrubbing everything else by hand.) These cleaning and isolation methods eventually worked, but of the 18 patients infected by KPC that year, six died from it. The NIH case showed how techniques more advanced than bleach and isolation can come in handy to tackle outbreaks. A team of NIH researchers used genome sequencing to quickly decipher and trace the genetic code of the bacteria from one patient’s infection to another so that they were able to figure out how it had spread. According to a 2013 study from the case, the technology allowed the staff to determine that all the patients had been infected from one another, not independently, and they were able to pinpoint their areas of weakness. Advanced investigative approaches like this genetic sequencing have allowed hospitals to better track and confront the new and aggressive drug-resistant strains alarming the medical community. The anxiety some medical professionals have about C. auris is valid: It is not acting in a way experts may have expected based on other forms of Candida , and that uncertainty translates into a need for caution. As experts have become more familiar with C. auris , they feel more confident about how to eradicate it from an environment and likely won’t need to take such extreme measures as ripping out parts of the ceiling and walls—a simple bleach cleaning would likely do the trick. The real danger is in human fallibility: If someone fails to designate tasks clearly, a piece of medical equipment may fail to get the thorough disinfecting and sanitizing it needs in a crisis. The environmental services staff—the (sometimes underpaid) people in charge of scrubbing a patient’s room—often aren’t allowed to touch the medical equipment, and that discrepancy can allow germs to sneak through. Some medical equipment, such as X-ray machines, cannot be reserved for just one patient, and hospitals may struggle to eliminate bacteria from such bulky and complex machines. Manufacturers of hospital equipment can accidentally introduce contaminants to their products. And doctors and nurses, who often work long shifts, are susceptible to the kinds of careless mistakes we all make. But still, patients shouldn’t worry toomuch about how their hospital is preparing for these new infections. As Susan Matthews wrote in Slate , your risk of being harmed, even if immunosuppressed, is extremely low.

On this episode, preschool kids get their first taste of democratic participation when they vote on their class name, and private schools try to display the value of democracy by making kids vote on everything , even the school budget. Does it work, or do kids make terrible decisions? One diagnosis of our modern-day political problems is that too many stupid people are voting for stupid things. There are two proposed fixes: mandate that everyone vote, so as to diminish the power of ignorant and irrational voters; or find ways to disenfranchise misinformed people. This week, we examine both proposals, whether compulsory voting is a solution to the problems of democracy and whether getting rid of democracy altogether can be wise or just. We look at Sudbury Valley School and Brooklyn Free School, democratic schools where people who are thought too ignorant and irrational to vote are given democratic power. Do these schools offer any lessons for our democratic problems? Guest voices include Jill Sheppard, Jason Brennan, Noleca Radway, Jonathan Ho, and alumnae of democratic schools. In the Slate Plus segment, we look at how the compulsory voting system in Australia works, examine whether compulsory voting has consistent policy implications, and consider arguments that it is an infringement on liberty.

"Judge Carlton Reeves: Donald Trump is leading an ""assault on our judiciary.""",slate.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/judge-carlton-reeves-donald-trump-assault-judiciary-scotus.html,"Judge Carlton Reeves. U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi/ Wikimedia In his nine years on the bench, Judge Carlton Reeves has proved to be one of the most eloquent, courageous, and principled jurists in the United States. Reeves, appointed by President Barack Obama to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, has issued a series of pathbreaking decisions protecting the rights of women and minorities. He struck down Mississippi’s same-sex marriage ban; invalidated a law banning abortions after 15 weeks, dismissing its ostensible goal of protecting women’s health as “pure gaslighting”; and threw out a racial gerrymander designed to dilute black citizens’ votes. This last decision so infuriated a conservative appeals court judge that she launched a personal attack on Reeves that is now the subject of a judicial ethics complaint . Advertisement Reeves is not one to mince words or conceal his contempt for injustice. And on Thursday, he delivered an extraordinary speech upon receiving the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in Law. Reeves’ speech is worth reading or listening to in full. The address is a powerful defense of diversity and equality, as well as a grave warning that, as Reeves put it: “We are now eyewitnesses to the third great assault on our judiciary”—one led by President Donald Trump. The first assault, Reeves explained, came during Reconstruction when white supremacists reversed the post–Civil War march of civil rights. Ku Klux Klan members and their allies attempted to assassinate black judges, shot black jurors, and “filled judgeships with former Confederates who had sworn to uphold slavery.” The second came after Brown v. Board of Education , when segregations assailed courts’ efforts to integrate the South, “smearing judges, shrinking judicial power, and scrubbing diversity from courtrooms.” Senators tried to strip courts “of jurisdiction over civil rights claims and impeach judges receptive to those claims.” Judges “who sought to deliver justice” faced “death threats and hate mail. Their pets were poisoned. Their children’s graves were desecrated.” Beginning with President Jimmy Carter, however, “our nation witnessed a revolution, one that dramatically expanded and improved the body of expertise federal courts depend on to find truth. We saw the addition of more black judges, more women judges, more Latina and Latino judges, more Asian-American judges, more Native American and Pacific Islander judges, and more openly LGBTQ judges than ever before.” But “this effort to make our judiciary reflect America was as brief as it was remarkable.” Because now the third assault has begun. Reeves continued:
If you’ve never relied on a court, you may not see the assault. If you’ve never seen a friend or loved one wrongly imprisoned, you may not feel it. If you have never been stopped for Driving While Black, like my friend Judge Robert Wilkins, you might not fear it. But if you know the words of Mississippi’s darkest moments, you can hear it. Advertisement Then, in a remarkable passage, Reeves listed Trump’s litany of condemnations against the judiciary:
When politicians attack courts as “dangerous,” “political,” and guilty of “egregious overreach,” you can hear the Klan’s lawyers, assailing officers of the court across the South. … When the powerful accuse courts of “open[ing] up our country to potential terrorists,” you can hear the Southern Manifesto’s authors, smearing the judiciary for simply upholding the rights of black folk. When lawmakers say “we should get rid of judges,” you can hear segregationist senators, writing bills to strip courts of their power. And when the executive branch calls our courts and their work “stupid,” “horrible,” “ridiculous,” “incompetent,” “a laughingstock,” and a “complete and total disgrace,” you can hear the slurs and threats of executives like George Wallace, echoing into the present. Every single one of these quotes was uttered by Trump. Reeves went on: Advertisement
I know what I heard when a federal judge was called “very biased and unfair” because he is “of Mexican heritage.” When that judge’s ethnicity was said to prevent his issuing “fair rulings.” When that judge was called a “hater” simply because he is Latino. I heard the words of James Eastland, a race-baiting politician, empowered by the falsehood of white supremacy, questioning the judicial temperament of a man solely because of the color of his skin. I heard those words and I did not know if it was 1967 or 2017.
This false seed is being sown across this country, from Mississippi to Virginia. I know, because I am there. The proof is in my mailbox. In countless letters of hatred I’ve been called a “piece of garbage,” “an arrogant pompous piece of sh**,” “a disgrace,” an “asshole …[who] will burn in hell,” and the “embodiment of Satan himself.” One person has even told me that he has “prayed that God will give [me] complete discomfort.” The deliverers of hate who send these messages aim to bully and scare judges who look like me from the judiciary. And so they share an aim with those who used whips and ropes and trees against my ancestors: scrubbing the black experience from our nation’s courts. Reeves then tore into the astonishing lack of diversity among Trump’s judicial nominees:
This attack is heard loudest in the slander of Judge Curiel. But it will be felt through this administration’s judicial nominations, especially those confirmed with the advice and consent of the Senate. Of the Article III judges confirmed under the current administration, 90 percent have been white. Just one of those judges is black. Just two are Hispanic. It’s not just about racial diversity. Barely 25 percent of this administration’s confirmed judges are women. None have been black or Latina. Achieving complete gender equality on the federal bench would require us to confirm only 23 women a year. … Think: in a country where they make up just 30 percent of the population, non-Hispanic white men make up nearly 70 percent of this administration’s confirmed judicial appointees. That’s not what America looks like. That’s not even what the legal profession looks like. …
This administration and a bare majority of the Senate, walking arm-and-arm, are not stumbling unaware towards a homogeneous judiciary. Think of the slurs against Judge Curiel. Think of the nominations to the bench of those who call diversity “code for relaxed standards,” who call transgender children part of “Satan’s plan,” who defend the KKK in online message boards, who led voter suppression efforts for segregationists like Jesse Helms. Think of the pattern of judicial nominees refusing to admit, like generations of nominees before them have, that Brown v. Board was correctly decided. The consequences of this “homogeneous judiciary,” Reeves noted, will be devastating to justice. Advertisement
Defending the judiciary means more than demanding that more women and people of color be appointed to the bench. With no Muslims on the bench, will our judiciary understand the many facets of religious freedom? How can it defend economic opportunity with so few judges who know the taste of a free lunch program or the weight of poverty? How can our judiciary understand the depths of mass incarceration when so few judges have stood with the accused or know them as neighbors, as Sunday School students, as loved ones? Filled only with the experiences of prosecutors and state court judges, of Big Law partners and corporate counsel, of a single religion or sexual orientation, our courts will fail to find the many truths justice must see. We need a judiciary as diverse as our country—as diverse as “We the People.” Reeves then turned to the Supreme Court. “We have as many justices who have graduated from Georgetown Prep,” he pointed out, “as we have justices who have lived as a non-white person. When our Supreme Court captures such a narrow set of perspectives, what truths will it overlook?” Moreover, too many justices have failed to defend the judiciary against Trump’s bigotry. “It is not enough for judges,” Reeves said, “seeing race-based attacks on their brethren, to say they are merely ‘disheartened,’ ” as Justice Neil Gorsuch did , “or to simply affirm their nonpartisan status,” as Chief Justice John Roberts has . “We must do more to defend our bench.” But courts “must do more than denounce and diversify.” Judges must demand “resources they need to find truth. We must expand the reach and power of our courts, offering justice to all who claim the promise of America.” Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has lately moved in the opposite direction . And Trump’s new crop of judges shows no interest in “offering justice to all.” Due to the cynicism and cowardice of senators and judges who kowtow to Trump, this “third great assault on the judiciary” shows no sign of ceasing. But Reeves refuses to stand by and watch the erosion of civil rights in quiet dismay. He has issued a call to arms for all who support a strong, independent, and diverse judiciary: fight for what you believe in before Trump and his allies “close the courthouse doors to those who most need justice.” "
William Barr obliterated the DOJ’s standard for defending laws because Donald Trump asked.,slate.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/william-barr-aca-lawsuit-donald-trump-doj.html,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Attorney General William Barr has faced harsh criticism for his problematic treatment of the Mueller report, which some have suggested appeared to be calculated to benefit the president. But a different action Barr recently took at President Donald Trump’s behest should be equally concerning. Last month, the attorney general announced that the United States will cease defending any portion of the Affordable Care Act in the courts. Instead, the DOJ will join a number of state attorneys general in challenging the constitutionality of the entire ACA, following the effective repeal of the individual mandate by Congress. Advertisement This comes after the DOJ stopped defending the constitutionality of the ACA’s protection of insurance coverage for those with preexisting conditions last year . In taking the position that the entire ACA is constitutionally void, Barr abandoned a long-standing principle that the Department of Justice is duty-bound to defend the constitutionality of federal laws. In the words of one of Barr’s predecessors, such an action by the nation’s chief law enforcement officer may jeopardize the equilibrium of our constitutional system. Barr has all but acknowledged that the arguments against the ACA’s constitutionality, although they were accepted by one trial judge, are far from compelling; in fact, most observers ( including some opponents of the law ) consider them to be extremely weak. But during testimony before Congress this week, Barr stated that he nonetheless feels duty-bound to attack the ACA in the courts because Trump, after failing to convince a majority of the Senate to vote in favor of repealing the ACA, is now eager to see the act nullified by the courts instead. Barr’s decision is at direct odds with a policy upheld for decades by attorneys general in Republican and Democratic administrations. As President Ronald Reagan’s first attorney general, William French Smith, wrote in 1981, the DOJ has “ a duty to defend the constitutionality of an Act of Congress whenever a reasonable argument can be made in its support .” While serving as President Jimmy Carter’s attorney general, Benjamin Civiletti explained that this policy is rooted in the Constitution’s separation of powers. While the courts are charged with protecting “ both the government and the citizenry from unconstitutional action, legislative and Executive [ … ] only the Executive Branch can execute the statutes of the United States, ” including by defending them in the courts. Therefore, “if executive officers were to adopt a policy of ignoring or attacking acts of Congress whenever they believed them to be in conflict with the provisions of the constitution, their conduct in office could jeopardize the equilibrium established within our constitutional system.” Advertisement Prior attorneys general recognized only one extremely narrow exception to this obligation to defend the nation’s laws: when an attorney general concludes that there is no reasonable argument in favor of a federal statute’s constitutionality. As Civiletti put it, where “everything in our constitutional jurisprudence inescapably establishes” that a law is unconstitutional, then the Executive Branch can properly decline to defend or enforce it. Until recently, conservative legal scholars emphasized the narrowness of this exception. Many of them assailed Eric Holder, President Barack Obama’s attorney general, for choosing to end the DOJ’s defense of a portion of the Defense of Marriage Act denying federal government recognition to same-sex marriages. While Holder argued that changes in Supreme Court jurisprudence left no reasonable basis to defend the law , his opponents contended that Holder was being disingenuous and placing ideological concerns above his duty to defend a duly enacted federal law. In fact, conservative legal advocate Edward Whelan continued to assail Holder’s decision to abandon the defense of DOMA even after the law was struck down by the Supreme Court, calling it a “ shameful moment in politicized government lawyering and … a dangerous precedent that deserves condemnation .” Barr’s decision to attack the ACA in court, however, sets a far more dangerous precedent. Unlike Holder, Barr does not even make a pretense of arguing that there is no reasonable argument in favor of the ACA’s constitutionality. Rather, during his recent testimony, Barr explained to Republican Sen. Susan Collins that he acceded to the president’s demand to attack the ACA in the courts because the arguments mounted against the law are “ defensible and reasonable .” Barr’s reasoning turns long-standing DOJ policy on its head, allowing the attorney general to abandon a federal law so long as there is some plausible basis to question its constitutionality—even if there are reasonable, or even compelling, arguments to be made in support of the law’s validity. When pressed, Barr asserted that supporters of the ACA have “ nothing to worry about ” if they are right that the arguments the DOJ is adopting against the ACA’s constitutionality are weak. “I think people should take a deep breath,” Barr said. “If this is such a wacky position that the administration is taking, then there’s nothing to fear. Then the law will be upheld.” Just “[l]et the courts do their job,” the attorney general suggested. But Barr’s argument misses the point. As his predecessor Civiletti observed decades ago, while it is the courts’ constitutional “job” to protect against “unconstitutional action,” the Constitution assigns the executive branch the obligation to faithfully defend the nation’s laws, including before the courts. It is, therefore, in Ed Whelan’s words, shameful for the DOJ to abandon that job. Advertisement Barr’s DOJ is already taking full advantage of its newfound freedom to pick and choose which federal laws to defend in court. Just this week the solicitor general informed House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler that the DOJ has chosen to cease defending the constitutionality of a federal law criminalizing the practice of female genital mutilation and cutting (FGM/C) . Earlier this month, the acting director of the DOJ’s Office on Violence Against Women decried the “horrific crime of” FGM/C,” explaining that “ at least 513,000 women and girls in the United States have suffered or are at risk of becoming victims ” of it. The FBI, ICE , and the State Department have all recently likewise reiterated a commitment to using the full force of the federal government against this heinous practice. But the federal law against FGM/C is largely grounded in Congress’ regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause, which conservative legal scholars and judges have long been intent upon limiting on principles of federalism; the other rationale for the statute—that it implements Congress’ power to enforce an international human rights treaty— is similarly objectionable to strong advocates of federalism . Accordingly, as in the case of the ACA, the DOJ is abandoning its defense of a law against this heinous practice for transparently ideological reasons. Advertisement In explaining his decision to mount a litigation effort against the ACA, Barr stated that he serves the president and other “ stakeholders ” in the executive branch. Therefore, if the president directs him to attack a statute, even one Barr seems to believe will ultimately be upheld in the courts, the attorney general considers himself duty-bound to oblige. This goes to the heart of Barr’s misconception of his role as attorney general. He is the lawyer for the United States, not for Donald Trump. As such, he and the DOJ owe a duty to uphold and defend the laws of the nation, even if the president does not like them, just as he is obligated to disclose facts uncovered by Robert Mueller, even if they are harmful to Donald Trump. Barr’s failure to abide by such foundational principles truly threatens the equilibrium of our constitutional system. "
Participation trophies aren’t new. We’ve been handing them out since World War I.,slate.com,Stefan Fatsis,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/participation-trophy-history-world-war-i.html,"Virginia Gives Hope to Humiliated Losers Everywhere Around the same time, universities began awarding a literal “participation trophy” to a fraternity or other group that had the most members participate in intramural sports. In 1924, the University of Minnesota debuted a “ 30-inch sterling participation trophy ” for “the campus organization having the highest number of participation points.” The idea was to encourage students to do sports—participation as something to be rewarded, because it’s good to exercise, to compete, to try hard, win or lose. The participation trophy was a feature of campus life for decades. Military bases handed out participation trophies during and after World War II. Schools and sports leagues picked up the practice, for individuals and teams. In 1942, each member of the winning team in the Western Division Class B of the Montana state boys’ basketball tournament—Corvallis, which beat Townsend, 50–35—got a miniature gold basketball, while “ all other players received participation trophies.” In 1955, the Ithaca, New York, peewee football program may have introduced the emphasis of playing over winning—hastening our cultural decline—when it gave a participation trophy to the team that used “ the greatest number of players per game for the season.” When David Holder and Billy Lothian of Wayne, New Jersey, were ousted from the 1955 state marbles championship, the local paper reported that they “came back with participation trophies.” “Susan and Dave Win Speech Test,” the Marysville, Ohio, Journal-Tribune headlined in 1956; 11 losers got participation trophies. So did the nonwinners in the 1970 Oneonta, New York, soap box derby, and the 17 members of the swine club and 13 members of the sheep club at the 1977 Lehigh County 4-H Beef Banquet (renamed the Livestock Banquet to account for the addition of swine and sheep). The Amsterdam News in New York recorded what might be the record for participation trophy distribution: 1,840 given to the “youngsters” in an anti-poverty recreation program in Brooklyn. The year? 1966. The headline on that story was “A Thousand Kids Earn Trophies.” The verb undoubtedly would have outraged James Harrison and could have served as a harbinger of the culture war to come. The handing out of participation trophies ratcheted up in the 1990s, coinciding with the growth of pay-for-play in youth sports, efforts to increase and broaden participation among children, and a cultural move to reduce the emphasis on winning. The first person to use “participation trophy” as an epithet might have been Janelle Gerth, the catcher on the 1993 Princeton, Minnesota, high school girls’ softball team, who, after back-to-back sixth-place finishes in the state tournament, “told the team that we’ve got enough participation trophies,” her coach told the St. Cloud Times. It was a short walk from there to the take that participation trophies foster entitlement and diminish achievement. John Powers of the Boston Globe complained in 1993 that “we have become a nation of ‘winners,’ our shelves lined with consolation trophies and certificates of participation.” Powers didn’t use the exact phrase, but a year later the Abbeville, Louisiana, Meridional did : “Participation Trophies Take Away Meaning.” A dad columnist in El Paso, Texas, complained in 1998 that participation trophies were responsible for “giving our children a false sense of accomplishment.” The backlash was in full swing by 2005, when the Wall Street Journal published a trend story on how youth sports leagues were abandoning participation trophies . While youth sports organizations continue to dump it , the participation trophy endures. But much more than a hunk of hardware, it’s a topic of study for its effects on children these days; a talking point for players like Bryce Harper and Kobe Bryant and coaches like Jeff Walz of Louisville’s women’s basketball team (and a sledgehammer point for the Alabama football strength coach); and a proxy for a dopey debate about whether a generation of Americans is spoiled, lazy, and needy. “Police Calm Millennial Protesters by Handing Out Participation Trophies,” a satirical website wrote in 2016 . People believed it . Literal participation trophies or medals are indeed dumb. Not because they send a “ dangerous life message ,” as a high school student wrote in the New York Times, or because they constitute “ child abuse ,” as a local news anchor in Washington said. They’re dumb because they inevitably wind up collecting dust. It’s fine to give a memento to children under the age of, say, 9 who complete a season of a sport or participate in some other competition. Just give them something useful, like a hat or a piece of equipment. Even better, give them something personal. Into middle school, every season, I designed a certificate for my daughter’s girls’ soccer team, the Power. One theme was a faux Instagram account written by our team mascot, Power Bar. The girls then created an actual account for Power Bar. Everyone participated in that. As Torie Bosch wrote in Slate last year, kids aren’t idiots . No one thinks they’re a great athlete—or, 20 years later, that they deserve a promotion—because they got a 4-inch-tall plastic cup for playing soccer in kindergarten. In a simpler time, a trophy for participation was just a trophy for participation. The top finishers in the 1955 soap box derby in San Bernardino, California, got a Schwinn bicycle, baseball equipment, fishing and scuba gear, and cameras. But the race organizers, and the local paper, didn’t want anyone to feel slighted. “ Best of all ,” the local paper wrote (emphasis mine), “each heat winner gets a trophy and both losers in each heat also get participation trophies.” The story was illustrated with photos of both trophies. The headline: “ Everybody Wins .”
This story was updated to include a 1993 Boston Globe article. "

Trump reportedly offered pardon to Homeland Security chief if he broke law to block migrants.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-offered-pardon-homeland-security-chief.html,"Notre Dame Cathedral Is on Fire President Donald Trump reportedly told Kevin McAleenan, who is currently the acting Homeland Security secretary, he would pardon him if he were sent to jail for blocking people from entering the United States along the southern border. Several outlets reported that Trump had that conversation with McAleenan last week when they were in Calexico, California. At the time, McAleenan was the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. Trump then named him head of Homeland Security after Kirstjen Nielsen resigned Sunday. Although several outlets have reported the conversation citing anonymous sources, the context of the pardon promise changes a bit depending on who is doing the reporting. CNN, for example, says Trump vowed to “ pardon him if he ever went to jail for denying US entry to migrants .” The New York Times, however, said the pardon promise came as the two were talking about closing the southern border entirely . Everybody does note though that it wasn’t necessarily clear whether Trump was joking. Although Trump had threatened to close the border earlier this month, he later backtracked and said he would give Mexico one year before taking such drastic action . Homeland Security issued a statement that doesn’t quite deny Trump’s promise of a pardon.“At no time has the President indicated, asked, directed or pressured the Acting Secretary to do anything illegal,” the department said in a statement. “Nor would the Acting Secretary take actions that are not in accordance with our responsibility to enforce the law.” Trump also denied that he offered the pardon. “Of course this is not true,” he wrote on Twitter . “Mainstream Media is corrupt and getting worse, if that is possible, every day!” Another Fake Story on @NBCNews that I offered Pardons to Homeland Securiy personnel in case they broke the law regarding illegal immigration and sanctuary cities.

Trump tax returns: Democrats give IRS new deadline of April 23.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-tax-returns-irs-new-deadline-april-23.html,"Notre Dame Cathedral Is on Fire House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal made clear Saturday that Democrats in the House of Representatives are not giving up on their demand to see President Donald Trump’s tax returns . Neal reiterated his demand for Trump’s tax returns, telling IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig in a letter that he has until April 23 to turn over the files. The move amounts to a rebuke of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who had said he wasn’t even sure that Neal had the authority to make the request in the first place. “I expect a reply from the IRS by 5:00 p.m. on April 23, 2019. Please know that if you fail to comply, your failure will be interpreted as a denial of my request,” Neal wrote in the letter that came days after Mnuchin said there was no way the administration could meet the original April 10 deadline. In the letter, Neal pushed back against Mnuchin’s questions about whether lawmakers had the oversight authority to make what the treasury secretary had characterized as “unprecedented” request. “The Committee’s request raises serious issues concerning the constitutional scope of Congressional investigative authority, the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose, and the constitutional rights of American citizens,” Mnuchin wrote . “The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically-motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power.” Neal said he wasn’t buying that rationale. “I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding my request, and the authority of the committee. Those concerns lack merit. Moreover, judicial precedent commands that none of the concerns raised can legitimately be used to deny the committee’s request,” Neal wrote. The hard deadline aspect of Neal’s letter is significant because it seems inevitable the request will turn into a long legal battle . If the administration denied the request then that could set the stage for a subpoena or a lawsuit. So far though, no one has denied the request outright. Neal also spells out in the letter why the request “falls squarely within the Committee’s oversight authority” and said that any questions of the motives behind the demand for documents were unacceptable. “It is not the proper function of the IRS, Treasury, or Justice to question or second guess the motivations of the Committee or its reasonable determinations regarding its need for the requested tax returns and return information,” Neal wrote.

They will be reunited in freedom.” The question about the whereabouts of Assange’s cat had spread like wildfire on social media after he was arrested Thursday in London . Assange got the cat in 2016, purportedly to keep him company as he spent his days inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. The cat gained quite a bit of a following on social media under the moniker, Embassy Cat , described as the master of “counter-purveillance.” In an interview with The New Yorker, Assange had said he called the cat Michi or Cat/stro.

"Donald Glover and Rihanna in Guava Island, reviewed.",slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/donald-glover-rihanna-guava-island-childish-gambino-letitia-wright-reviewed.html,"This isn’t America. Amazon Studios Guava Island , Amazon Prime’s Donald Glover–produced musical film , hit the streaming service Saturday morning, and it isn’t very good. Although the secretive production and limited free-streaming window suggested Glover—musical stage name Childish Gambino—was working on a project like Lemonade, it turns out the main thing Glover took from Beyoncé was the marketing plan. Instead of a coherent piece of art in which sound and image trace and deepen the same thematic paths, Guava Island, in which Glover plays a musician trying to put on a festival against the wishes of a local despot, is a collection of unrelated, mostly previously released songs indifferently stitched together by a hokey narrative. (The complete lack of chemistry between Glover and his costar Rihanna—who doesn’t sing in the movie—doesn’t help.) There’s nothing wrong with reverse-engineering a movie from its music—see, e.g., the greatest musical of all time —and the rustic Cuban locations are lovely, but screenwriter Stephen Glover and director Hiro Murai mostly spend their time making excuses for launching into songs that are unrelated to what’s happening on screen. For example, here’s the awkward monologue Glover has to deliver in order to shoehorn in a new arrangement of his hit “This is America” into Guava Island , which is set on Guava Island, a place that does not exist anywhere, but especially does not exist in America:
This is America. Guava’s no different than any other country. America is a concept. Anywhere where in order to get rich, you have to make someone else richer, is America. The seams show, to put it mildly. You don’t have to have seen The Hollywood Revue of 1929 to appreciate Singin’ in the Rain —in fact, it’s easier if you haven’t!—but it’d be impossible to appreciate Guava Island ’s musique concrète version of “This Is America” without knowing the original music video , a much sharper fusion of sound and image that was also directed by Hiro Murai. It’s unclear why any of the talents involved wanted to stage a less-effective version of something they got right the first time, but whatever their motivations, Guava Island is the very definition of a derivative work. And it’s derived from many works. Advance material for Guava Island namechecked City of God and Purple Rain , but Black Orpheus , The Harder They Come , and even Dancer in the Dark have space on the production’s mood board. The affinities go beyond plot and setting: Cinematographer Christian Sprenger layers film grain and scratches over a sun-faded palette for a 16mm aesthetic, even rounding the corners of the narrow frame to evoke home movie projectors . This was almost certainly done in post-production: The credits say the film was shot digitally, and Spengler managed something similar on Atlanta by making a film print of his episode, then rescanning it . But the effect is slightly marred by a precise, shallow focus that doesn’t quite match Guava Island ’s other low-budget signifiers. And speaking of shallow focus, Guava Island ’s story is full of it. From the animated opening, in which Rihanna explains the suspiciously Lorax-like backstory of the island and her dream of “a new life, free from survival,” to the groanworthy final voiceover, nothing in Guava Island ’s 55-minute runtime stands up to a minute’s thought, despite valiant efforts from supporting actors Letitia Wright and Nonso Anozie. There’s something about the entire project that’s backwards: Murai’s “This Is America” video made Glover’s music sharper and more specific; Guava Island glops up the same music with a half-baked allegory that dulls every note.

"SNL: Emma Stone parodies a meticulous parody of Klymaxx's ""Meeting in the Ladies Room.""",slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/snl-klymaxx-meeting-ladies-room-parody-emma-stone-original-video.html,"Is it real, or was it all a wonderful dream? Klymaxx / NBC Say what you will about Saturday Night Live, no one can deny that the current cast and crew have exquisite taste in pop culture detritus. In December, Kyle Mooney and Beck Bennett restaged an entire episode of Full House , and last spring, the show aired a painstaking parody of Oran “Juice” Jones’ creepy video for “The Rain .” And this week, for no apparent reason, SNL meticulouslyrecreated the music video for “Meeting in the Ladies Room,” a truly bizarre single with an even more bizarre music video. Here’s the original, which you will not believe is real but very much is real: Again, that was an actual music video that aired on actual television. (For confirmation that this is a real thing from the 1980s and not a hoax created by Saturday Night Live to justify filming their own version, consult the full page ad on page 9 of the “Friday” section of the Chicago Tribune of May 10, 1985, in which you will find Meeting in the Ladies Room listed as a “Downtown Records Cash Saver.”) Not only was this a real song, it was really on the soundtrack to a real movie, 1985’s Secret Admirer , featuring 2019 supervillain Lori Loughlin: Naturally, there was nothing for Saturday Night Live to do but have the cast and this week’s host Emma Stone faithfully recreate the music video, complete with the amazing “LADIE’S ROOM” neon sign. OK, so the ending isn’t exactly how the original video played out, but Saturday Night Live has still done something invaluable here: They’ve reminded Americans that we belong to a proud culture that, at our civilization’s height, was capable of producing masterpieces like the “Meeting in the Ladies Room” video by Klymaxx. We owe it to the memory of our noble ancestors to create art today that, although it seems unremarkable to us now, will be just as hilarious in 2053 as “Meeting in the Ladies Room” is in 2019. If we don’t, Season 78 of Saturday Night Live is going to be a real drag. "

NBC Saturday Night Live hires so many talented impressionists that any sketch premise that allows the cast to assemble a collection of faux famous people— celebrity game shows , movie screen tests , Ariana Grande holding a microphone —is almost guaranteed to become a recurring segment. So it is good news for both SNL and civil society in general that this week, the most obvious way for the show to fill a room with celebrities was to set the cold open in prison. Until quite recently, it would have been difficult to imagine circumstances that would put Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti, Full House star Lori Loughlin, and rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine in the same place at the same time. But in the last few months, Loughlin was criminally charged for her involvement in a college admissions cheating scandal , Assange got evicted from London’s Ecuadorian Embassy and now faces extradition, Tekashi 6ix9ine pled guilty to federal racketeering charges , and Avenatti was indicted for what can only be described as a crime spree . It’s a new era for celebrity accountability, which means it’s also a new era for Saturday Night Live celebrity impression sketches: It is a rare treat these days to see Kate McKinnon do an impression without extensive makeup, and Pete Davidson, who rarely gets much to do in sketches, pulls off an entire monologue without breaking. But the star is undoubtedly Michael Keaton as a gum-chewing Assange, strutting around the holding cell boasting about being the “King of Chaos” and the “Scourge of the Cleaning Staff at the Ecuadorian Embassy.” The only thing more fun than playing a Bond villain is playing an incompetent Bond villain, and Keaton is having the time of his life. Most of all, it’s fun to see a group of SNL celebrity impressions bouncing off each other without anyone having to play Jeopardy! It’s going to be complicated to weigh the evils that come from mass incarceration against the benefits we might reap from finally making some famous people follow some of the laws, but one thing is clear: Imprisoning as many rich and powerful people as possible will only make Saturday Night Live funnier.

Or at least to this Congress. If the lawmakers were more to his liking sounds like the commander in chief could maybe change his mind. “This is a dangerous, dangerous road and frankly, Chris, I don’t think Congress, particularly not this group of congressmen and women, are smart enough to look through the thousands of pages that I would assume that President Trump’s taxes will be,” Sanders said on Fox News Sunday . Chris asks @PressSec if the President will tell the IRS not to release his tax returns #FNS pic.twitter.com/RBaVniYMKj — FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) April 14, 2019 Sanders then went on to say that part of the reason why lawmakers are unqualified for the job is that they likely hire people to do their taxes for them. “My guess is that most of them don’t do their own taxes, and I certainly don’t trust them to look through the decades of success that the president has and determine anything,” Sanders said. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal filed a formal request for Trump’s tax returns earlier this month for six years of Trump’s tax returns. He made the request to the IRS citing a little-known tax statute from the 1920s. On Saturday Neal made a second request for the files and gave the IRS a hard deadline of April 23 to hand over the files . Sanders argued Sunday that with their actions Democrats in Congress are putting “every American” in jeopardy. “If they can single out one, they can single out everybody.” Support our journalism

Tiger Woods wins the 2019 Masters. It might be his greatest victory ever.,slate.com,Jim Newell,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/tiger-woods-2019-masters-win-greatest-major-victory.html,"The Title-Deciding Instant Replay Ruling in Monday’s NCAA Final Was Totally Insane A knee surgery, four back surgeries, a sex scandal, a chipped tooth, an arrest, a prescription drug problem, no swing, the chipping yips, and a sliding cop. That’s a partial list of what’s occurred in Tiger Woods’ life since he last won a major at the 2008 U.S. Open. He’s 43 years old now. And he just won the Masters for the first time in 14 years, his 15 th career major victory. You choose the hyperbole of where this achievement ranks in Masters history, golf history, and sports history. But it’s pretty high in all of those! I did not think he would win heading into Sunday, where play was moved up to the morning to beat afternoon thunderstorms. He’d never won a major without having at least a share of the third-round lead, and he trailed the third-round leader, Francesco Molinari, by two strokes. Molinari, the reigning British Open champion, played the first three rounds like the best player in the world, making only one bogey over 54 holes. And Brooks Koepka, the reigning U.S. Open and PGA Championship winner, trailed Tiger by only one shot entering Sunday. Molinari and Koepka had faced runs from Woods in the previous two major championships and successfully stiff-armed him away. They were not scared of him. Woods’ early-round play on Sunday, as it had been all week, was dicey. He bogeyed the monstrous par-4 fifth hole for the fourth straight day.* He missed a couple putts from inside 10 feet. Molinari hit a fair share of uncharacteristically sloppy shots, but he always found a way to recover. And then the par-3 12th hole happened. Both Molinari and Tony Finau, the third member of the final group, went for the hole and lost their tee shots into the water. Both made double bogey. Koepka, playing in the group ahead, had also put it in the water on 12 for a double bogey. This is the classicAugusta mistake, and Tiger’s main competitors fell for it. Woods, meanwhile, parked his shot in the middle of the green, about 50 feet away, for a two-putt and a share of the lead. Molinari and Woods held each other in sight until the 15th, a par 5 protected in front by water. Tiger, from about 230 yards, put his second shot in the middle of the green—this was one of many moments during Sunday’s final round where I exhaled deeply after dangerously intermittent breathing over the course of several minutes—and two-putted for birdie. Molinari chunked his third into the water and was done. Woods had the lead to himself. Then, on the par-3 16 th , he dropped the dagger. Aside from the 18 th hole celebration, this is the moment we’ll remember from the tournament. When you have Tiger Woods and the 16th hole at the Masters, special things happen. pic.twitter.com/b95cA3p7bn — CBS Sports (@CBSSports) April 14, 2019 Koepka, who recovered well from his 12 th hole debacle, was Tiger’s last obstacle. When his birdie putt on 18 missed low, though, Tiger got to walk down the final fairway with a two-stroke lead. He chipped it up and tapped in for a bogey to win by one. The scene, when he tapped in the last putt, was indescribable. Tiger Woods has won the Masters. His 81st PGA TOUR win.His 15th major title. — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) April 14, 2019 Woods was asked after his round where this win ranked among all of his 81 PGA Tour wins and 15 major championships. Is it better than the 1997 Masters, his first major? The 2000 U.S. Open, where he won by 15, in what’s generally considered the greatest four-day performance in the sport’s history? The 2008 U.S. Open, which he won on the 91st hole with one functioning leg? “It’s gotta be up there, right?” he said. Right. Maybe even at the top.
Correction: This story misstated par on the fifth hole. It’s a par 4, not a par 5."

The cassowary, which is similar to an emu, killed 75-year-old Marvin Hajos on Friday near Gainesville. The Alachua County Fire Rescue Department said the bird appears to have attacked Hajos when he fell and likely killed him using its long claws. “It looks like it was accidental. My understanding is that the gentleman was in the vicinity of the bird and at some point fell. When he fell, he was attacked,” Deputy Chief Jeff Taylor told the Gainesville Sun . Although an investigation has been opened, officials said that it looks like the death was accidental. “Initial information indicates that this was a tragic accident for Mr. Hajos,” said Lt. Brett Rhodenizer, a sheriff’s office spokesman, in an email to the paper. “The cassowary involved remains secured on private property at this time.” The San Diego Zoo’s website describes the cassowary as dangerous and points out just what makes this bird that can weigh up to 130 pounds so deadly: “The cassowary is rightfully considered the most dangerous bird in the world! Each 3-toed foot has a dagger-like claw on the inner toe that is up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) long! The cassowary can slice open any predator or potential threat with a single swift kick.” Although people eat cassowaries in New Guinea, those who have the bird in the United States are likely to be hobbyists."

Barely known at the beginning of the year, Buttigieg has seen a surge of interest from Democratic voters and donors as many have been attracted to the possibility of electing the youngest-ever president and the first who is openly gay. At the rally in his hometown, Buttigieg said he was well aware that his candidacy was more than a little unconventional. “My name is Pete Buttigieg. They call me Mayor Pete,” Buttigieg said to cheers from the crowd that had packed a former factory. “I recognize the audacity of doing this as a Midwestern millennial mayor. More than a little bold—at age 37—to seek the highest office in the land,” he said. “But we live in a moment that compels us each to act.” Buttigieg characterized his campaign as the opposite of President Trump and his slogan while using his hometown’s turnaround as an example of what he can accomplish t. “There’s a long way for us to go.

Wallace introduced the video to begin questioning Sanders on Trump’s attack against the freshman lawmaker. But he quickly cut it off. “Now, that was the only five seconds we felt comfortable showing,” Wallace said . “It goes on in a much worse way for about 43 seconds, of her seeming, no question about it, to minimize 9/11, and then horrible images from 911.” Wallace then went on to ask why the president is “comfortable putting out horrible images like that” before asking whether the president isn’t worried about inciting violence against Omar or Muslims in general. Sanders ignored the first question and went straight for the second, vehemently denying the president could be inciting violence. “Certainly nothing could be further from the truth,” Sanders responded. “The president is not trying to incite violence against anybody.” She then went on to characterize Omar’s remarks as “disgusting and abhorrent.”"
Madonna's new album Madame X: The pop star releases a video teasing her next album.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/madonna-madame-x-teaser-new-album-new-persona.html,"Intelligence experts now believe that Madonna’s world tours were cover stories for Madame X’s secret missions. Madonna Pop star Madonna released a first look at her upcoming album and newest persona on social media on Sunday. They’re both called Madame X , and this time around she’s going for a secret agent vibe. In the teaser, over an excerpt from some of her upcoming music, Madonna appears in a variety of costumes that allude to past personae, from an eyepatch and tie ensemble that gives off Mistress Dita vibes to a “Music”-style cowboy hat . She also seems to be very concerned about leaving fingerprints: The video shows her using a vintage typewriter while wearing slippery black leather gloves and playing guitar—steel-stringed!—in lace gloves, complete with soon-to-be-shredded fingertips. Madonna has reinvented herself so many times that virtually any collection of clothing you could put her in would include a few things that look like allusions to her past, but the voiceover suggests the pop star is working on a unified theory of her past alter egos. It turns out she was a spy all along!
I decided to call my record Madame X . Madame X is a secret agent traveling around the world. Changing identities. Bringing light to dark places. Madame X is a dancer. A professor. A head of state. An equestrian. A prisoner. A student. A mother. A child. A teacher. A nun. A singer. A saint. A whore. And a spy in the house of love. I’m Madame X. Sunday’s Instagram tease is the first time Madonna has proclaimed herself Madame X, but she is only the latest in a long line of Mesdames X. Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau didn’t have a choice in the matter—John Singer Sargent named the painting —but Alexandre Bisson’s 1908 play by that name and its many, many adaptations meant that for a while, there was a new Madame X every few years. Bisson’s Madame X wasn’t much of an aspirational figure, though: She is thrown out of her home by her husband and separated from her young son after having an affair. Years later, her son—who doesn’t know her—becomes the Attorney General, then ends up being unknowingly assigned to prosecute her for a murder she committed to protect her son from scandal. But if Madame X the character was not exactly aspirational, Madame X the lead role was something everyone wanted. When melodrama was still a thing, the play was an astonishingly popular text to adapt for the screen: movies were made in 1910 , 1916 , 1918 , 1920 , 1929 , 1931 , 1937 , 1948 , 1952 , 1955 , 1956 , 1966 , and 1981 —and that’s not even counting the stage or radio versions . Pre-Madonna Mesdames X include Oda Nielsen, Dorothy Donnelly, Emilia Márkus, Pauline Frederick, Ruth Chatterton, María Fernanda Ladrón de Guevara, Gladys George, Mara Russell-Tavernan, Gloria Romero, Lale Oraloglu, Kyveli, Lana Turner, and Tuesday Weld. Here’s how Lana Turner announced she was Madame X: Madonna is also not the first Madame X in music, at least with some allowances for spelling. There was also Madam X, the hair metal band behind classic anthem slash adolescence survival guide, “High in High School.” The video starred a very young Peter Dinklage, years before Game of Thrones : Judging from the music in Madonna’s post, her new album is probably not a sonic journey to the days of hair metal, nor will it be supported by a series of videos in which high school students are saved from boredom when Madonna crashes the classroom or dining room and teaches everyone—including the stuffy teacher or parent, possibly also played by Madonna—how to party. On the other hand, the new music sounds pretty good! No release date has been announced yet, but given Madame X’s chameleon-like talent for disguises, we should all keep a careful lookout."
"Trump’s campaign raises $30 million in first quarter, far outpacing Democrats.",slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-campaign-raises-30-million-first-quarter.html,"Notre Dame Cathedral Is on Fire: The Spire Has Collapsed, but the Towers Will Survive President Donald Trump raised more than $30 million for his re-election bid in the first three months of the year, according to his campaign. That means the commander in chief now has $40.8 million of cash on hand , which amounts to a record at this stage of the race and is far higher than any of the Democratic hopefuls. In fact, it is more than the combined total of what the top two candidates raised considering Sen. Bernie Sanders got $18.2 million and Sen. Kamala Harris, $12 million. Trump’s number is even greater when you take into account that the Republican National Committee has raised $45.8 million. The huge number can in part be explained because Trump enjoys the traditional incumbent advantage. But the president also began raising money much earlier than his predecessors.There’s concern within Democratic circles that while Democrats fight among themselves in the primary, Trump will continue building up his war chest to give him a huge advantage once the general campaign starts. That is what the Trump team seems to be hoping for as well with a senior campaign official telling NBC News that after the primary “we expect them to be bruised, battered, and broke.” Trump worked to set up his re-election effort shortly after he moved into the White House and he became the first president to ever file his re-election paperwork on the same day as his inauguration. The president’s fundraising effort is trying to woo big donors, of course, but it is also aiming to obtain small donations from supporters. And the effort appears to be working. Almost 99 percent of donations to Trump in the first quarter were for $200 or less and the average contribution was a mere $34.26. Trump’s reelection campaign has the goal of raising a total of $1 billion for the 2020 contest. Support our journalism

"Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode 1, reviewed.",slate.com,Willa Paskin,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-season-8-premiere-review.html,"This Week’s Worst Person in Westeros: Jon Snow Game of Thrones was once a rapidly expanding universe, a story that added characters, locations, storylines, and complications as if it had no outer limit. New continents popped up in the architectural models of the opening credits; dynastic families with their own convoluted histories were cavalierly introduced; major characters died in gruesome circumstances with jarring frequency, fracturing the story further still. But what once expanded must now contract. Game of Thrones is ending, and though the brutal course of human history never stops, stories do. You don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay in Westeros (at least, not until the prequels ). In the blandly decent first episode of the final season, Game of Thrones started flicking the lights, putting characters in place for whatever comes next, while running through a number of long-awaited reunions and first-time meetings. It was less an episode and more a breadcrumb, leading us to the next breadcrumb, which will lead us to the next one, until said breadcrumbs get scorched by dragons, destroyed by White Walkers, or sliced up in some other internecine dispute—and on and on, until we come to the end. As a critic, I have never felt like I was tilting at windmills more than when I have written about whether Game of Thrones is actually good or not , whether its increasingly slavish devotion to what comes next has undermined the show, and if it has set itself up to disappoint by putting so much pressure on the final outcome. We’re all watching, and no one wants to hear it . Besides, as a person who has also devoted umpteen hours to Game of Thrones , I, too, would very much like to know what happens next. As far as I am concerned, the big extant question about Game of Thrones , the TV show—bigger than all the billions of tiny questions about the arcane cosmology of its universe—is whether or not it will turn out to be a Bad Fan of Game of Thrones , the books. Will it try to provide some kind of morally uplifting narrative closure, or will it end in moral uncertainty? Will the show give us a schmoopy happy ending that completely undermines the ideas that have animated the series, or will it give us a morally gnarly resolution that doesn’t?

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. For my money, the best scene in the episode (also the only one in which anything really happened) was when Sam told Jon he’s “always been the king of the Seven Kingdoms.” I didn’t love it because it was so rousing, but because it was so messed up. What if, after all of this, Game of Thrones is just a long defense of the idea that blood really should confer power on some people and not others, even when that blood is known to belong to enlightened despots and genocidal pyromaniacs? What if Game of Thrones gives viewers a happy ending it believes is happy, but is actually an advertisement for continued tyranny? The possibility made my blood run colder than the jump-fright provided by that chopped-up ice zombie. Momentum, the idea that we are hurtling toward some conclusion that will explain it all, has been so encoded into the Game of Thrones experience that in the absence of any forward motion, the show is … kind of dull. To zip it up for myself, I turned the episode into another kind of parlor game, ranking all of the episode’s pas de deux, first meetings, long-awaited reunions. This list, obviously, is definitive. 1. Sam and Dany This first encounter was very good because it was very bad. Cheery, friendly princess of the people Dany tries her best to appeal to her boyfriend’s BFF, but fails miserably when she has to reveal to an increasingly distraught Samwell Tarly that she murdered his father and his brother. Ooops. Sam, one of the show’s most reliable barometers of real morality, met Dany and found her wanting. 2. Sansa and Tyrion While I think that “rooting” for anyone to “win” is genuinely antithetical to the entire meaning of the show, I am … totally rooting for Sansa, so I like it when she gets to be wise and embittered and neg Tyrion. 3. Theon and Yara Weirdly, given how generally inscrutable and boring I find the Iron Islands plotline to be, I found this reunion moving. I’m glad Theon is pulling his tattered psyche together in time to go sacrifice himself for the Starks. 4. Arya and the Hound The problem with all of Arya’s encounters with friends and frenemies from her past is that she is so twisted and morally enervated she can’t experience joy or happiness outside the context of bloody revenge. But the Hound is also twisted and morally enervated, so their affectionate show of mutual disdain was fairly satisfying. 5. Arya and Gendry I was not expecting my rom-com banter to come from Arya and Gendry—“I always knew you were just another rich girl”; “You don’t know any other rich girls”—but no complaints. 6. Jon and Arya Should have been moving! Was not! Also downgraded this scene because having two sequences in a row reference Sansa and intelligence is a bad sign for Sansa, whom I am not rooting for except that I am. 7. Dany and Sansa Game of Thrones —despite the sexposition that is somehow still happening —has more interesting, knotty female characters than it does male ones. And yet the groundwork is being laid for the show to devolve into a Dany vs. Sansa catfight, with Jon as the dope between them. Not feeling it. 8. Jon and the Dragon Aka an advertisement for a future theme park ride. 9. Bran and Jon “You’re a man!” Jon tells Bran, who is, in fact, a cardboard statue. 10. Bran and Jaime This was the record-scratch ending of the episode: Bran and Jaime laying eyes on each other for the first time since Jaime tossed Bran out a window, paralyzing him, in the show’s first episode. It would pack more punch if Bran was still Bran, and not a monotonous, all-seeing automaton."

Game of Thrones season eight premiere recap: The Night King can't get here fast enough.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-season-eight-winterfell-recap-where-is-the-night-king.html,"¯\_(ツ)_/¯ HBO Game of Thrones returned for its final season on Sunday night, and although there are still several episodes left for the show to redeem itself, it’s hard to see the season premiere, “Winterfell,” as anything but a step backward. The episode exemplifies one of the most frustrating things about Game of Thrones : Whenever it seems to find its focus and start moving the plot along (see, e.g., “Hardhome” or “The Dragon and the Wolf”), the writers almost immediately plunge back into internecine quarrels between the villains, which, as the show itself keeps reminding us, don’t matter at all in the face of the Night King and his army of the dead. The Season 8 opener wasn’t all jawing and moving pieces on the board around, but many significant moments happened off screen. And it’s never a great sign when an episode’s most thrilling scenes—soldiers encircling a group of wildlings, a majestic dragon in flight, White Walkers on the march—all come during the “Previously On” section. Still, someone’s got to set the dominoes up before they get knocked over, and director David Nutter and screenwriter David Hill do a superb job of establishing a sense of impending conflict in the opening scene. It’s sort of a riff on the “ All Gold Canyon ” chapter of The Ballad of Buster Scruggs : We see a beautiful pastoral landscape—snow on the quiet forest floor, a stream that’s just about to freeze—invaded by a single child, sprinting across the frozen ground. As the camera follows him, more and more of the natural world is replaced by signs of man, until he encounters other people, first individually, then in groups, then in an impassable crowd. The camera finally pulls back as the child climbs a tree, revealing a vast army of the living marching into Winterfell. The shot evokes the end of Ivan the Terrible, Part I , which doesn’t speak well of the mental state of Winterfell’s leadership, and the crane shot from Gone With the Wind , which doesn’t speak well of anyone’s chances against the White Walkers. It’s an extremely efficient machine for producing dread. Unfortunately, that’s one of the last sparks of excitement in the episode. Hill and Nutter seem to know they’re going to have a hard time keeping the audience interested while very little is happening, because they have a character interrupt two other characters’ pointless exchange of formalities with this preview of coming attractions:
We don’t have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon. He’s one of them now. The wall has fallen. The dead march south. But nobody listens, least of all the filmmakers, because there are still 50-odd minutes of the episode to fill, and they’re mostly filled with squabbling. It’s important for Game of Thrones to establish that the fractious human factions in Westeros are ill-prepared to face a unified, disciplined force like the Night King’s army, but eight seasons in, the point has already been made. And “Winterfell” is so dedicated to presenting every conceivable character pairing that it sometimes feels like watching a Punnett square. It finally seems like something is going to happen when fan favorite the Mountain—easily the most likable character south of the wall—moves to interrupt an assignation between two other characters. But it’s a cruel fakeout: Not only does the Mountain not kill anyone, the very next scene is a return to the show’s absolute worst Season 1 tendencies: It’s set in a brothel for no discernable reason besides filling the frame with creamy, unmarred, warm human skin, without a single exposed rib cage or dangling jawbone to keep things decent. There have got to be better ways to evoke the horrors the Night King rides against without this kind of gratuitous exploitation.

The lighting is finally as dark as it should be , and after an episode filled with warm hearths and flickering candles, it’s a relief to see a snowy courtyard take on a welcoming blue tint in the freezing night air. The scene takes place shortly after a battle, which strongly suggests that some of the money that paid for hours and hours of incomprehensible human muttering would have been better spent getting the Night King’s victory at Last Hearth on screen. Nevertheless, it’s still stirring to see pools of blood staining the snow red, and it was a smart move, particularly in an episode as grim as “Winterfell,” to reassure the audience that the series isn’t going to spend the entire season wallowing in miserabilism. Better yet, after an episode dedicated to old enemies, Hill and Nutter give the audience a new friend at last, a blue-eyed charmer of perhaps 12 years of age who lives on a wall in the basement of Castle Umber surrounded by a gorgeous spiral of severed limbs. But Game of Thrones didn’t get its reputation for narrative cruelty for no reason, and if you were expecting a happy ending, you probably should have watched Melancholia . Seconds after the show introduces the most promising character in several seasons , he is run through with a flaming sword and dies in the worst way imaginable: warm, surrounded by people who care about him, and miles from the nearest wight or zombie. It makes sense to emphasize human cruelty as the show heads toward its final confrontation between good and evil, but it’s brutal to watch a life end so painfully when it had only just begun. Sadism toward the audience aside, however, the main point of a season premiere on a highly serialized show like Game of Thrones is to provide the heroes with motivation for their battles to come. When the Night King finds out about the atrocity at Last Hearth, his righteous anger should be enough to power an entire season. Let’s just hope the good guys get a little more screen time next week.

Vaccination discussions can’t just be about science-based medicine.,slate.com,Gregory E. Kaebnick,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/vaccination-values-science-based-policy.html,"Police Are Making Tone-Deaf Memes to Build Community Trust Policy debates about scientific topics have an infuriating habit of seeming to disregard the obvious facts. That’s what makes recent developments in the debate about childhood vaccination so tantalizing. With record-high cases of measles around the world generating media attention, the Senate holding hearings about the dangers of the anti-vaccination movement, and Facebook adopting new rules for vaccine-related content , it seems we might be on the verge of squelching vaccine misinformation . Perhaps clear, concise, and evidence-based answers to questions about vaccine safety along with some myth busting can sort everything out after all. But getting the facts right is not the most important part of the debate. When confronted with evidence that the vaccines are safe and effective, opponents find a way to raise doubts . They present their own facts , demand unrealistic evidentiary standards—rock-solid proof of 100 percent safety—and question the integrity of those producing the evidence. Before we can make a meaningful dent in the number of people who refuse to vaccinate their children, we have to accept that “because science” won’t convince anyone. At the end of the day, it’s values—beliefs about what matters, what’s important, what should guide our lives and societies—that are most important. Values are not ignored in the vaccine debate; claims about parents’ rights and harms to children are common. But too often, the pro-vaccination discourse fails to recognize or thoroughly explore the role they play in the discussion, and in parents’ minds. Whether it’s doctors talking to patients, experts writing for the public, public health messages designed to increase the vaccination rate, or ordinary citizens posting on Facebook, just arguing about the facts won’t get at what’s really driving debate. What we see in the debate about vaccines is not unique, of course. Think climate change , for example, where debate focuses on the effects of greenhouse gases (spawning a further debate about what counts as good science). Or genetically modified organisms , where the central issue is consumers’ health. In these debates, too, it’s not enough to explain the facts and debunk the misconceptions. Although measures to slow the spread of misinformation can be helpful, “myth busting” and appeals for “science-based” policymaking usually are not. Some of the better-recognized reasons for this phenomenon are rooted in human psychology. There is an enormous literature on the various cognitive biases that cause people to see and understand the world in ways that may not square with the facts. Confirmation bias—the tendency to accept facts that fit our prior beliefs—is thought to be particularly important in the vaccine debate , but other biases (aversion loss, status quo bias) may also play a role. Such biases are typically regarded with disdain and despair, but the important point is not really that people are bad at thinking. It’s that what they feel strongly about—their values—helps guide them as they navigate the world. There are also social reasons. People can be classified according to the set of basic values that motivate them, and differences across these value sets probably drive some of the disagreement in the science debates. Some people care more than others about cleanliness and purity, for example, and research suggests that they tend to dislike vaccines more strongly. Such concerns, reflecting views about human nature and the relationship of humans to the rest of nature, might lie submerged in political claims about parents’ rights—the simpler political values motivated by the more intricate and obscure values. Because they are in part matters of upbringing and culture, basic value sets are closely connected to personal identity and group allegiance, generating another influence on cognition: Somebody seen as challenging views that define one’s “tribe” is unlikely to get a fair hearing. And finally, social and economic trends have spawned a deep distrust, on both the right and left, of expertise, privilege, and power. And with good reason: The public has legitimate interests in asking challenging, even distrusting, questions about who’s in control of the scientific enterprise. Other, less widely discussed reasons have to do with the very nature of facts. First, as the political theorist Deborah Stone explains in her influential book Policy Paradox: The Art of Political Decision Making , “facts do not exist independent of interpretive lenses, they come clothed in words and numbers.” The point is not that every fact is a changeable social construction; it’s that most interesting phenomena can be described and explained in many contrasting ways, and the descriptions and explanations we end up with can vary according to the questions we’re asking. Whether a vaccine is better described as a well-tested tool for preventing disease or a foreign incursion into the body may hang on whether you’re comparing it to medical interventions or to causes of disease and disability. When vaccine opponents ask about the standards of evidence, they’re not just being obstructionist. What counts as “good enough” evidence is a question of interpretation, influenced by the comparisons that dominate their thinking. Second, the facts about socially important issues are almost always contestable, and how they support moral and political judgments sometimes depends on the weight we give them—which is to say, on the values we attach to them. Which is worse: a low-likelihood but high-impact outcome like an allergic reaction, or a high-likelihood but low-impact outcome like the ouchie your kid will get from the needle? A cost-benefit analysis, that paradigm of policy rationality, might assign equal weight to these outcomes, but must everyone see it that way ? And come to think of it, how “low-impact” is it that you are consciously allowing someone to hurt your child? Some parents are untroubled; others find it very difficult. (Similar questions arise in other debates. If you care about the effect of genetically modified crops on nature, which matters more: that insect resistance can lead to lower herbicide use, or that a plant’s genetic code has been “hacked”?) The result of all this is that, although measures to slow the spread of misinformation can be helpful , “myth busting” and appeals for “science-based” policymaking usually are not. They are often just efforts to shut down one’s opponents in a way likely to be deeply threatening and infuriating to them. At best, they ignore what’s most important. While the debaters dwell on facts, what drives them apart are competing values about (for example) personal liberty, political power, human nature, science and technology, the relationships of individuals to society and of humans to the rest of nature, and the weights assigned to different kinds of harms and benefits, and even to uncertainty. Facts inform policy, but values are the basis. To have a better debate, we need to change how we communicate with the people we’re trying to persuade. The approach we should take will likely vary depending on the relationship and the audience. A doctor-patient interaction is different from a televised debate with a vaccine skeptic, for example, and a vocal and determined vaccine denier is extremely unlikely to be won over. Before an audience of the merely vaccine-hesitant, emphasizing the scientific consensus and correcting misconceptions may yet be helpful, if it’s done just right . In all contexts, though, we should find ways to express and elicit underlying values. There’s helpful advice in the nascent literature on how experts should talk to the public . Some of this advice can come across as vaguely disingenuous and manipulative: Experts can “nudge” people into accepting the facts by framing the conversation appropriately; cognitive biases can be turned in the scientists’ favor; establishing a personal connection with an audience is a first step in winning them over. But the chief points are to stop haranguing people, to address their interests, and to put values up front. Often, it’s helpful to think about what makes for an effective face-to-face conversation. Instead of treating people as criminals , fools , or misfits , how about listening to their concerns , practicing a little modesty, and recognizing that everyone loves their children ? Narratives can play an important role, both as a way of finding out about the other person’s concerns and conveying the importance of vaccination. Putting values up front does not magically make everybody come to affectionate agreement, of course, but it is more respectful of diverse views, it helps clarify the points of disagreement, and it is usually a necessary first step toward compromise.

Rep. Ilhan Omar says death threats have increased since Trump tweet.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/ilhan-omar-death-threats-trump-tweet-september-11.html,"Why Nancy Pelosi Is So Comfortable Dismissing the Influence of AOC and Her Fellow Lefties Rep. Ilhan Omar, the freshman lawmaker who has been under attack by President Trump based on a speech she made last month about Islamophobia in the wake of Sept. 11, said in a statement Sunday night that she has faced a number of death threats after Trump tweeted a video vilifying her. “Since the President’s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life―many directly referencing or replying to the President’s video,” she said in the statement . “I thank the Capitol Police, the FBI, the House Sergeant at Arms, and the Speaker of the House for their attention to these threats.” The video Trump tweeted cited a speech Omar made to the Council on American Islamic Relations on March 23. “For far too long, we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I’m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,” Omar said in the speech. “CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.” On April 9, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (who at one point was an administrator for a Facebook group that called Islam a “cancer”) tweeted out a clip of her comments condemning her description of the terror attacks as “some people who did something.” The next day, Fox & Friends played that line from the speech, and host Brian Kilmeade wondered aloud if “she’s an American first .” The day after that, the New York Post published a photo from the attacks on its cover , causing a coalition of Yemeni-American bodega owners to announce a boycott of the Post, accusing the tabloid of taking Omar’s words out of context in an effort to “provoke hatred and fear.” And on Friday, Trump tweeted out the offensive video, which spliced images of the burning Twin Towers with Omar’s comments. “We will never forget!” Trump wrote in the tweet. Many Democrats immediately responded with outrage and accused the president of attempting to foment hate and bigotry among his supporters through attacks on the first congresswoman to wear a hijab in office. Others pointed out the irony of the attacks from a president not known for his empathetic behavior in response to the Sept. 11 terror attacks: Trump himself went on a radio show on the day of the attacks and bragged that he now had the tallest building in downtown Manhattan. He also continued to use the tragedy to support Islamophobic conspiracy theories. During his campaign, he falsely claimed he saw “thousands and thousands” of Muslims in Jersey City cheering and celebrating as the World Trade Center collapsed in the attack—a lie he stood by repeatedly . On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she had spoken with officers in charge of security on Capitol Hill to ensure Omar’s safety. “They will continue to monitor and address the threats she faces,” Pelosi said in a statement . She also called for Trump to remove the tweet. “The President’s words weigh a ton, and his hateful and inflammatory rhetoric creates real danger ,” she said. Earlier in the month, a 55-year-old New York man was charged with threatening to kill Omar by “put[ting] a bullet in her…skull.” In response to the criticism, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Sunday defended Trump’s tweet by attempting to redirect the conversation to another conservative attack on Omar: her supposedly anti-Semitic comments . “Certainly the President is wishing no ill will and certainly not violence towards anyone,” Sanders said on ABC’s This Week . “But the President is absolutely and should be calling out the congresswoman for her not only one time but history of anti-Semitic comments.” While the president himself didn’t fully address the pushback, he did attack Pelosi for defending Omar: Before Nancy, who has lost all control of Congress and is getting nothing done, decides to defend her leader, Rep. Omar, she should look at the anti-Semitic, anti-Israel and ungrateful U.S. HATE statements Omar has made. She is out of control, except for her control of Nancy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019 Omar, who in her statement Sunday night also charged that the president’s rhetoric encouraged hateful white nationalists and other right-wing extremists and led to an increase in hate crimes, defended herself on Twitter after Trump’s attack and reiterated her reasons for running for office. “No one person—no matter how corrupt, inept, or vicious—can threaten my unwavering love for America,” she wrote on Twitter. “I stand undeterred to continue fighting for equal opportunity in our pursuit of happiness for all Americans.”"
Reading the redacted Mueller Report: seven things to look for.,slate.com,Richard L. Hasen,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-release-redacted-preview.html,"What Ilhan Omar’s Speech Really Meant Attorney General William Barr has indicated that a redacted version of the Mueller report is likely to be sent to Congress this week and made public. It could come any day now, though a Good Friday release, coinciding with the beginning of Passover, would be the news dump to end all news dumps. ( Update, April 15, 2019, at 12:10 p.m.: On Monday, the Department of Justice announced that it expected to release the report on Thursday morning.) Whenever the report comes, how will we know what to look for? From Barr’s summary released a few weeks ago, we expect the report to focus on both the question of possible “collusion” between Russian agents and Americans as well as whether the president obstructed justice in seeking to prevent a full and fair investigation of possible collusion. Passover begins with asking four questions, and in that spirit, I begin with four questions about possible collusion that I have been anticipating since the Barr summary that I hope we will be able to answer once we get to dig into the report itself. On collusion: 1. To what extent did Americans assist or cooperate with Russians or other foreign agents in hacking Democratic National Committee emails, in trying to break into American voter registration databases, or in efforts to spread “dirt” on President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential election opponent, Hillary Clinton? We know from earlier government reports that Russian agents did all three of these things, but we do not know whether any Americans were involved or might have known at the time of the interference. Barr’s summary of Robert Mueller’s report, meanwhile, stated that Mueller’s investigation “did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” Did members—or affiliates—of the campaign, though, coordinate with any Russian cutouts, such as Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks? 2. Were any of the people involved in this collusion investigation somehow connected to the Trump campaign or the Trump family? Alternatively, to what extent were campaign or family members duped by foreign agents? The Barr summary is very careful to say that there was no finding in Mueller’s report of “coordination,” which it defined in a particular legal way as an “agreement—tacit or express—between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference.” As Ben Steinberg suggests , there’s plenty of room for cooperation short of this legal standard that could be described in the report. For example, Mueller might believe that winks and nods suggested both sides were cooperating but doing so in a subtle enough way to prevent prosecutors from proving an illegal conspiracy. 3. How successful were the hacks into American voter registration databases and other election-connected computers? We have seen conflicting reports of the extent of Russian success in these endeavors, but the details have not been confirmed in an official government report. More importantly, what can be done to prevent such hacking efforts again? 4. If Americans cooperated with Russians in procuring or spreading opposition research, why did Mueller not charge any Americans with any crime in this area? As I explained in an earlier Slate piece , we must learn why Mueller declined to prosecute former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort or Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. for apparently violating laws prohibiting the solicitation of foreign contributions to American campaigns, based on those campaign surrogates’ June 2016 meeting with Russian agents at Trump Tower. As I wrote, “How Mueller answered this question could have profound ramifications for what federal law enforcement will do to stop foreign involvement in the upcoming 2020 elections.” Does Mueller point to new specific evidence Congress might consider in pursuing possible impeachment charges against Trump based upon obstruction? I have two additional—and similarly important—questions on how Mueller judged the issue of potential presidential obstruction of justice: 1. Does Mueller’s report use any language suggesting that a reasonable prosecutor acting in her discretion could have charged Trump with obstruction but for Department of Justice policy against indicting a sitting president? We know Mueller refused to make the call on whether Trump obstructed justice, but we do not know why he made that decision and whether it had to do with the strength of the evidence. All we know is that Mueller’s report says, “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him” and Barr took the subsequent step of exonerating his boss. 2. Does Mueller point to new specific evidence Congress might consider in pursuing possible impeachment charges against Trump based upon obstruction? If Mueller left the issue for Congress, does he do so laying out clear not previously public evidence for possible impeachment, or is there not much more than a judgment call about whether Trump’s publicly known actions rise to the level of impeachable offenses? Finally, there is a remaining question that encompasses the entire probe and how it was ultimately dealt with: To what extent does it look like Barr is trying to protect Trump and Trump’s family, such as Donald Trump Jr.? Despite his expected redactions, has Barr made it possible to evaluate Mueller’s reasoning or the evidence collected? This is a key question. Already Barr has given Trump a great gift by releasing a summary that has allowed Trump to claim his “exoneration” for weeks without anyone being able to raise a counterargument based on the actual evidence collected and analyzed by Mueller. We all are waiting to see if the redaction leaves a credible report, or more reason to be suspicious of Barr and a longer list of questions. We should at least know the answer to this question in a matter of days. Support our journalism

John Oliver revisited the opioid crisis on Sunday, and while he criticized Cardinal Health, McKesson, and AmerisourceBergen, he reserved his most vehement criticism for Purdue Pharma. First, though, Oliver dismissed the idea that pharmaceutical companies can be trusted to regulate themselves when it comes to addictive painkillers. “If the bears in your zoo get out at night and start mauling the other animals, you don’t deputize one of the bears to monitor the situation,” he said. “I know what you’re thinking: But John, I’ve already bought him a little sheriff’s outfit to wear, and I think he’d look great in it . Of course he would, but at the end of the day, bears are gonna bear.” To dramatize how Sackler has responded to opioid addiction, Oliver recruited Michael Keaton, Bryan Cranston, Michael K.

Trump signs executive order extending U.S. military commitment in Somalia.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-somalia-executive-order-military-national-emergency.html,"What Ilhan Omar’s Speech Really Meant Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: The U.S. is committing itself to a long-term stabilization mission in a chronically unstable country. The mission involves training and equipping the local government forces to fight against jihadi insurgents and won’t end until those local forces are capable of fighting on their own. Unfortunately, recruitment is low and the training is slow going, in part because the local U.S.-backed government is weak and commands little public support. Under the pretext of fighting international terrorism, the U.S. is taking on a group that poses little direct threat to the United States, is being drawn into local conflicts unrelated to its ostensible mission, and risks creating more radicalization through civilian casualties. It could be Iraq or Afghanistan (or substitute c ommunist for jihadi and it could be any number of Cold War proxy conflicts), but in this case it’s Somalia. Last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order extending a 2010 declaration of national emergency related to the conflict in Somalia, reiterating that the U.S. remains “strongly committed to Somalia’s stabilization” and that the “situation with respect to Somalia continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.” As I wrote in March , the U.S. military mission in Somalia has expanded dramatically since Trump took office and declared the Horn of Africa nation an “area of active hostilities.” This has included a sharp uptick in drone strikes and special forces raids against the militant group al-Shabaab. Until recently, the Pentagon had claimed, remarkably, that no civilians had been killed in these strikes. On April 5, shortly after the release of an Amnesty International report that investigated five of the dozens of strikes and found evidence of 14 civilian deaths, the military finally acknowledged having caused just two . There have also been reports that Somali officials have used the threat of al-Shabaab —which is nominally affiliated with al-Qaida—to draw U.S. firepower into local conflicts over land and clan rivalries. The U.S. currently has about 500 to 600 military personnel in Somalia, and they may be there for a while. As CNN reports , the U.S. mission “hinges on US Special Operations Forces being able to train an elite Somali army unit capable of defeating al Qaeda-linked militants on the ground.” The hope is that this group, known as Danab, will one day be an elite fighting force of about 3,000 troops capable of operating throughout the country, but right now it’s only about 500. One Pentagon official told CNN that it may take “approximately seven years for the Somalis to absorb all of these forces.” Nearly two decades into the war on terror, critics of U.S. military intervention are accustomed to treating missions like this with skepticism. But in this case, the bigger question is, why isn’t the president more skeptical? Since taking office, Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to reduce U.S. military commitments overseas and a frustration over what he sees as U.S. troops being asked to fight other countries’ wars for them. One wonders whether he even realizes he’s committing U.S. troops to a seven-year mission to prop up the government of Somalia at a time when the country’s own neighbors are desperate to pull their troops out of the conflict . (And extending an Obama administration executive order on top of that!) There’s an inherent contradiction in Trump’s worldview between his isolationist instincts and his commitment to standing out of the military’s way and letting the generals do what they think necessary—unlike the Obama administration’s approach, which he believes was burdensome and legalistic. Left to its own devices, the Pentagon tends to want more troops, more resources, and expanded missions. This dynamic was on view recently in Syria. After declaring victory over ISIS, Trump ordered a full withdrawal of U.S. troops in December. Trump’s advisers and congressional allies eventually talked him down to leaving a peacekeeping force of 200 or even 1,000 troops in the country to protect U.S. allies on the ground and prevent ISIS’s return. This will probably remain the status quo until the next time Trump gets frustrated and tweets about it The fight against al-Shabaab in Somalia has gotten far less attention from media and lawmakers than the fight against ISIS in Syria, and perhaps consequently, Trump appears to have taken little notice of it. And so, the war continues to expand with vague goals, no clear path to victory, and little to no pushback in Washington. "

Notre Dame fire: Authorities blame renovations for massive blaze.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/notre-dame-fire.html,"What Happened While We Were Waiting for the Mueller Report The fire at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris continued to burn into the night Monday, but after a day of fighting the blaze, the smoke began to thin, offering hope that parts of the iconic Gothic structure could be salvaged. The city fire chief announced that the main structure of the church—the two landmark rectangular towers—have been saved, but that two-thirds of the roof along with the spire had been destroyed. The preliminary assessments of the cause of the fire continue to point towards this being an accident associated with renovations being made to the structure. There have been reports of some artifacts, including the Crown of Thorns and the Tunic of St Louis, being recovered from the blaze, but the fate of numerous priceless pieces remains unclear. Smoke rises around the alter in front of the cross inside the Notre Dame Cathedral as a fire continues to burn in Paris, France, April 16, 2019.

Phoebe Waller-Bridge is helping Daniel Craig fix a James Bond script.,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/phoebe-waller-bridge-james-bond-daniel-craig.html,"This Week’s Worst Person in Westeros: Jon Snow James Bond is getting the Fleabag treatment. The Guardian reports that Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the droll BBC hit’s creator, writer, and star, will bring her darkly funny eye to the world of James Bond on the script for the franchise’s anticipated upcoming film, which has the working title Bond 25. Intriguingly, the request for Waller-Bridge came straight from the top: from none other than 007 himself, Daniel Craig. According to the Guardian, Craig was dissatisfied with Bond 25’ s script, which was originally developed by John Hodge and then reworked several times over by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Scott Z. Burns. But when Craig still felt that the screenplay could use some “polishing,” he turned to Waller-Bridge, whose work he had admired on both Fleabag and the buzzy BBC series Killing Eve , which she created. The pair have reportedly already discussed potential revisions to the Bond script that would help inject some of the TV scribe’s trademark idiosyncratic humor. Waller-Bridge has been a rising star since the debut of Fleabag . But as of late, she’s become a fixture in the land of auteur TV with Killing Eve , which stars Sandra Oh as a bored spy opposite the fantastic Jodie Comer , who plays an assassin. The series, which has already earned somewhat of a cult following, returned to BBC America for its second season last weekend, while the long-awaited Season 2 of Fleabag is set to debut on Amazon Prime in May.

What Trump should have passed instead of the tax bill everyone hates.,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/tax-day-trump-bill-everyone-hates.html,"My Sexually Generous Boyfriend Totally Avoids Me During My Period. Is This a Deal Breaker? Everybody hates Donald Trump’s tax law. OK. Not everyone. I’m exaggerating. But as of Monday, the first tax day on which Americans are filing their personal returns under the regime set up by the Tax Cuts and Jobs act of 2017, the bill is decidedly unpopular—less beloved, even, than the perpetually underwater president who signed it. According to Gallup, 40 percent of all Americans (and just 32 percent of political independents) approve of the thing. Pew, similarly, finds just 36 percent give the law a thumbs up. A big part of the problem, it seems, is that most people do not believe that Republicans actually cut their taxes, and in many cases are under the impression that they were on the receiving end of a tax hike. According to a survey by the New York Times and SurveyMonkey, only 40 percent of adults believe their taxes dropped under the new law. The number has been even lower in other polls. Gallup reports that only 14 percent of Americans think that their federal income taxes went down due to the statute, while 21 percent believe they rose, with 64 percent who were unsure or thought they’d stayed the same. CBS got a similar result : 25 percent believed their taxes were lower, 32 percent believed they were higher, and the rest thought there’d been no change. Most Americans are almost certainly mistaken about this. The Tax Policy Center has estimated that about 65 percent of taxpayers should have seen their liability drop this year, and just 6.3 percent should have seen a hike. The gap between reality and perception is so large that the New York Times felt compelled to run an article on Monday titled,” Face It: You (Probably) Got a Tax Cut .” Politically, this is an astonishingly bad outcome. According to the most recent forecasts, the GOP’s tax cut will ultimately cost $1.9 trillion over a decade. As I’ve written before, for about that much money, they could have sent a $1,000 check to every worker in America (and adjusted it for inflation) for the next ten years. Heck, they could have included an auto-signed picture of the president to go along with it; instead of a bunch of stories about how nobody realizes they got a tax cut, the headlines would be all about how Americans were spending their Trump Bux. Why is the public so ill-informed about the effects of the GOP’s tax bill? Conservatives would probably blame the media. But Republicans made a series of fateful choices that helped doom their legislation in the public eye. For starters, many initial versions of the GOP’s legislation did raise taxes on a surprisingly large share of middle and upper-middle-class Americans, which journalists naturally covered, and Democrats turned into a sticky narrative that the legislation was a broad, middle-class tax hike. 1 The bill’s benefits were also tilted toward high earners and corporations, which contributed to the impression that there was little for your typical family in the law. It also curtailed some especially popular bits of the tax code, such as the deductions for state and local taxes and mortgage interest, which caused an uproar in places like the Northeast where many voters have long relied on them. Later iterations of the bill created fewer losers. But Republicans were never able to shake away the impression that they had crafted legislation that hiked taxes on a bunch of homeowners in New Jersey and California in order to shave down Walmart’s IRS tab. But the bigger issue was seemingly much simpler than all that: For most Americans, the tax cut was just kind of small and easy to miss. The Tax Policy Center estimates that , among the middle 20 percent of households, the average tax cut amounted to just $1,050 on average. Strung out across a whole year, it amounts to just $40 per bi-weekly paycheck. That amount is not especially noticeable, especially since Americans often see their incomes change year-to-year (they get raises, their hours change, etc.). The administration probably made this problem a bit worse for themselves by tweaking the IRS withholding rules to maximize how much of the tax cut showed up in workers’ take-home pay, rather than giving families a bigger refund at the end of the year, where they may have actually picked up on it. (According to the IRS, the number and average value of tax refunds are both basically flat compared to last year). The fact that their tax cut has turned out to be widely despised does not mean it was a total political loss for Republicans. It handed large tax cuts to corporations and high-earners who will happily continue donating to the party’s coffers; the GOP scratched capital’s back, and capital will likely scratch theirs back. But there are lessons to be learned here. If you’re going to cut people’s taxes, don’t write a bunch of draft bills that make it look like you’re raising them instead. And once you do pass the legislation, make sure people realize they actually got a cut. In other words, give them Trump Bux.
1 Take the early Senate bill: Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that , by 2023, about 13 percent of all Americans, 20 percent of those earning $75,000 to $100,000, and 27 percent of those making $100,000 to $200,000, would have seen a hike under the legislation.

Why Nancy Pelosi Is So Comfortable Dismissing the Influence of AOC and Her Fellow Lefties,slate.com,Jim Newell,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/nancy-pelosi-aoc-lefties-congress.html,"The Supreme Court Divides Into Prudes and Cool Kids as the Justices Debate Naughty Trademarks During a 60 Minutes profile that aired Sunday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was asked a question that she doesn’t seem to love: Can she keep a caucus that has both more centrist members and more socialists from falling apart? “By and large, whatever orientation they came to Congress with,” Pelosi told interviewer Lesley Stahl, “they know that we have to hold the center, that we have to go down the mainstream.” When Stahl began another question about managing the “wings” of the party, including “[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] and her group,” Pelosi interrupted her. “That’s like five people,” Pelosi said. It was the latest in a series of flip comments Pelosi and the Democratic majority leader, Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, have made in recent months minimizing the influence that progressives like Ocasio-Cortez, Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar have in the caucus. In February, Pelosi referred to the Green New Deal, a still-nascent resolution that excited Republican political operatives almost as much as it excited progressives, as “the green dream or whatever … nobody knows what it is but they’re for it, right?” She also has repeatedly taken impeachment off the table. Meanwhile, in a March speech at the AIPAC conference, shortly after much of the caucus had reprimanded Omar for comments that some perceived as anti-Semitic, Hoyer said to an appreciative audience that “by the way, there are 62 freshman Democrats. You hear me? 62. Not three.” The following day, his office issued a statement clearing up the remarks, which were interpreted as a slight to progressive members who’ve energized parts of the electorate. It’s not that complicated to understand why Pelosi isn’t obeying the will of the far left of her caucus. “Our Caucus has a dynamic freshman class of sixty-three new Members, all of whom are doing a great job and bringing unique perspectives and backgrounds to their work in the House,” the statement read. “In pointing out that much of the press attention has been on a few new Members in particular, I was lamenting that the media does not appear to be paying enough attention to other excellent new Members who are also bringing important new energy and diverse perspectives to our Caucus and to the Congress.” Taking questions at a Monday event in London, where she’s traveling during the current congressional retreat, Pelosi expanded further on her own view of the lefties who’ve been dominating news coverage but not necessarily the House floor agenda. While describing representatives like Ocasio-Cortez as “wonderful” members of the Democratic caucus, she said that districts like Ocasio Cortez’s—or Pelosi’s San Francisco district—could elect the glass of water from which she was drinking if there were a “D” next to it on the ballot line. Those members, and their more radical plans, are not majority makers. “But the 43 districts [we flipped from Republican officeholders] were right down the middle: mainstream, hold-the-center victories,” she said. “And if we’re going to be helping the 1 in 5 children in America who goes to sleep hungry at night, who lives in poverty in our country, we have to win .” It’s not that complicated to understand why Pelosi isn’t obeying the will of the far left of her caucus, and why she’s pursuing, say, a health care agenda more in line with tweaking Obamacare’s existing structure rather than something more disruptive like single-payer. Running a center-left agenda to protect “front-line” incumbents with big targets on their backs in 2020 is a path that just about any Democratic speaker would follow, especially in a divided government. The more interesting question is why, and for how much longer, the left wing of her caucus will allow her to pursue this course. Republican House leaders didn’t always feel it was electorally useful to pursue, say, a hard-line immigration strategy, but the right-wing bloc of the caucus used its leverage, often, to ensure they did. And the Republican “establishment” equivalent of any one of these comments— it’s just a few of them ; the green dream or whatever —would have sparked an incredible backlash from the GOP’s base and those backbenchers. Pelosi must not be feeling such a backlash, because she keeps casually tossing backhanded remarks the left’s way. For top Democrats, what passes for restraint is when aides use anonymity to crudely trash-talk the left wing of the caucus: “What we’re here to do is get something done, not introduce legislative proposals that are Bernie Sanders’ wet dreams,” one senior Democratic aide told Politico last week. Pelosi might only really consider changing her posture toward the emboldened left flank of the party if the left flank of the party emboldens. Progressives thought they might have had a victory last week when their opposition over spending cuts helped scuttle a House Democratic budget vote, but Pelosi and Hoyer found a procedural workaround that allowed them to proceed writing spending bills anyway. A couple of days later, at the House Democratic retreat, Progressive Caucus co-chairs Pramila Jayapal and Mark Pocan insisted that the spending negotiations were still in their early phase, and that there were still plenty of leverage points ahead in the budget process where they might gum up the works if they don’t get a boost in domestic spending. But does that mean they’re prepared to vote down a budget agreement on the floor? To vote down an appropriations bill? Until there’s a move like that, which would embarrass House Democratic leaders and likely earn the leftmost members of the party the enmity of their colleagues, we’ll continue seeing Pelosi giving them the dismissive flicks of the wrist as she works to “hold the center” ahead of 2020. And maybe that is, as Pelosi told Lesley Stahl, “fine” with them. Maybe those two or three green-dreamers, or whatever, understand that the central goal of the next two years is to unite the government: to defeat Trump, take the Senate, and then wage these ideological battles when their legislation has a chance of becoming law. Pelosi let on, in her London remarks, to this strategy of patience ahead of 2020, after which the full “exuberances” of the caucus could be properly channeled. “We must win,” she said. “When we win, and we have the White House and we have that, then we can expand our exuberances to some other things.” Support our journalism

Donald Trump's Ilhan Omar tweet might be the worst tweet in history.,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/donald-trump-ilhan-omar-tweet-its-bad-folks.html,"On Friday, Donald Trump posted the following on Twitter: WE WILL NEVER FORGET! pic.twitter.com/VxrGFRFeJM — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2019 The video splices together footage from Sept. 11, 2001, and a clip of a March speech Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar gave to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)—a clip edited to suggest that Omar had flippantly described 9/11 as “something” perpetrated by “some people” rather than as an attack on the United States perpetrated by terrorists. Trump’s tweet about Omar might be the worst tweet ever. Let’s review everything that’s wrong with it. 1. It’s dishonest. It takes almost no research to understand that Omar’s wording, in the context of a speech that was actually about upholding American ideals , was meant only to distinguish the small group of (non-American) Muslim extremists who perpetrated the attack from the much larger group of (American) Muslims whom she believes were subjected to unwarranted scrutiny and harassment in its wake. What Omar said, emphases mine, was that “[CAIR] recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.” 2. It’s racist. Trump has a history of blaming every Muslim in America for the actions of any individual Muslim. His tweet fits in this tradition by suggesting that Omar is on Team Terror and that the rest of “us” aren’t going to forget it. It’s a method of assigning group responsibility that he’s never applied to white Americans after the many acts of mass violence carried out in the U.S. by white people. Racist! 3. It arguably incites violence. A week before Trump’s tweet, a Trump supporter in New York was arrested for threatening to murder Omar , who is one of the first female Muslim American members of Congress. A number of prominent Democrats have suggested that Trump’s propagandistic, revenge-themed video constitutes an incitement to target Omar; at best, the video and tweet are reckless and cavalier about her safety. 4. It’s hypocritical, opportunistic, etc. On 9/11, Trump crassly (and incorrectly ) claimed in a radio interview that now that the World Trade Center towers were no longer standing, he owned the tallest building in lower Manhattan. He would later claim ( incorrectly ) that the state of New York sent him money to reimburse him for Ground Zero cleanup/recovery work that he claims (with no supporting evidence) his company helped with. His administration is now attempting to give secret nuclear power technology to Saudi Arabia, the country whose government—per a congressional investigation —may have helped provide “support and assistance” to a number of 9/11 hijackers. In sum, respecting 9/11 victims and holding their perpetrators accountable only seems to be important to Trump when it can be exploited to bully someone he doesn’t like. Not cool! 5. It’s in all caps. All caps makes everything 50 percent dumber. It’s a crowded field , but I think you could make an argument that, given the reach of Trump’s account and the stakes involved—him being, you know, president—the Omar tweet was objectively the worst one ever sent. Or at least you could have made that case until Monday afternoon, when Trump used Twitter to send firefighting tips to the nation of France. So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019 It turns out that this suggestion could have caused the total collapse of the entire structure . Truly, we may not live in the worst moment in history, but we certainly live in the one that most resembles being trapped inside a TV that an angry, racist crank is shouting at 24 hours a day."

"Game of Thrones: How bad is it to marry your aunt, as Jon Snow might do?",slate.com,Shannon Palus,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/jon-snow-daenerys-targaryen-game-of-thrones-aunt-nephew-marriage-genetic-risks.html,"The Problem With San Francisco’s Proposal to Ban Vaping Game of Thrones ’ audience has known that in indulging in a relationship with Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow was inadvertently sleeping with his aunt. In Sunday’s premiere, Jon himself learned of his true parentage, which presumably means that, somewhere off screen clad in furs and looking contemplative, he too connected the dots about his new fling. We all know that in the world of Westeros, twin siblings have procreated without genetic repercussions, but how bad, exactly, is a nephew-aunt relationship? Scientifically speaking, two people with overlapping genetic material increases the likelihood that their offspring will inherit two faulty copies of a gene and therefore experience a disorder, geneticist Tiong Tan writes in the Conversation: “For many genes, our body can cope with just a single working copy, but when both copies are faulty, the person gets an autosomal recessive disease,” like sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis. Even still, cousin-cousin couplings are common in many societies and have been throughout history—Einstein and Darwin both did it. And while the risk of genetic issues roughly doubles , the absolute risk is still very low (somewhere between 4 and 7 percent), meaning that the vast majority of babies from such unions will still be healthy. After evaluating the risk, Popular Science declared , “Go ahead, marry your cousin.” Incest laws don’t exist just to keep the likelihood of genetic disease down—they exist because of the deep power imbalances that can exist between older and younger family members. If cousin marriage is technically OK, how much does the risk increase with a closer genetic link? As Tan explains, while a pair of first cousins share just an eighth of their genes, parents and kids share half their genes, and an aunt and a nephew share a quarter. A 1971 study estimated that it’s four times as genetically risky for parents and kids to have offspring vs. first cousins, as the coefficient of inbreeding—a measure of genetic closeness —for the kid is one-fourth versus one-sixteenth. Extrapolating from there, an aunt-nephew baby would have an inbreeding coefficient of one-eighth, meaning reproduction would carry double the genetic risk compared with a cousin-cousin baby. Not great. (Another lesson: don’t google “aunt incest” at work. That yields porn.) In modern society, what’s more problematic than the risk of disease (present in many pairings that don’t involve folks who are related) and even the substantial taboo (we’ve come around on a number of sexual acts and couplings that were once taboo) are the interpersonal realities. In 2014, a New York court ruled that an uncle-niece marriage was allowed (New York is one of 20 states to also allow cousin-cousin marriage), partially on the grounds that the uncle in question was only half-siblings with the bride’s mother. But as one judge pointed out, incest laws don’t exist just to keep the likelihood of genetic disease down—they exist because of the deep power imbalances that can exist between older and younger family members. Even with cousins who are closer in age, the logistics are tricky. As Slate’s Dear Prudence, Daniel Ortberg, counseled one man who wanted to sleep with his first cousin, what happens if things don’t work out and then you have to keep running into each other at family gatherings? The previous Prudie ruled in the opposite direction in a separate case—when Emily Yoffe got the cousin question , there was an additional twist in that the two partners were unaware of their genetic links. Yoffe counseled the letter writer—who secretly fathered one of the kids via an affair—to stay quiet and let the couple be. Jon and Dany find themselves in different circumstances, of course. The Targaryens aren’t exactly getting together for holidays. Dany can’t bear (human) children. Still, the familial connection might still cause trouble if Snow’s parentage is more widely learned—it’s clear that at least some forms of incest are taboo in Westeros.

First GOP candidate announces primary challenge to President Trump.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/first-gop-candidate-announces-primary-challenge-to-president-trump.html,"""Jake, I'm announcing that I'm running for President... as a Republican against the President in 2020.""Former Gov. Bill Weld officially announces he is challenging President Trump for the GOP nomination. https://t.co/Q5z30Qjw8o pic.twitter.com/QBSwtdxPUx — The Lead CNN (@TheLeadCNN) April 15, 2019 Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld announced he will run for the Republican nomination for president, marking the first GOP challenge to President Donald Trump’s reelection bid. Weld made his announcement on CNN Monday afternoon saying, “I really think if we have six more years of the same stuff we’ve had out of the White House the last two years that would be a political tragedy and I would fear for the Republic, so I would be ashamed of myself if I didn’t raise my hand and run.” “Ours is a nation built on courage, resilience, and independence. In these times of great political strife, when both major parties are entrenched in their ‘win at all cost’ battles, the voices of the American people are being ignored and our nation is suffering,” Weld said in a statement on his run for president. “It is time for patriotic men and women across our great nation to stand and plant a flag. It is time to return to the principles of Lincoln—equality, dignity, and opportunity for all. There is no greater cause on earth than to preserve what truly makes America great. I am ready to lead that fight.” The former two-term Massachusetts governor is from a wing of the Republican Party that has been set adrift by the new Trumpy GOP, making his path to the nomination a remote one. Fiscal conservatism, some semblance of ethics, and a penchant for bipartisanism will certainly alienate the 73-year-old Weld from much of the new GOP, but it will provide a welcome relief from the Trump onslaught in 2020. Depending on who, if anyone, else gets in the race, Weld will likely command some substantial support from the portion of the party that hasn’t decamped and remains appalled by their party’s monstrosity of a figurehead. There are a handful of Republicans rumored to be mulling a similar primary challenge to Trump, like Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and former Ohio Gov.John Kasich, but both of those candidates have significantly more to lose than Weld if they choose to run. Weld has largely been on the periphery of his party and hasn’t held office in nearly two decades, such that he doesn’t have much of a career to ruin at this point. He can fight the good fight and bow out gracefully. Hogan and certainly Kasich harbor aspirations for higher office, which taking on the leader of the party—and losing—would surely decimate, barring another sudden shift in the GOP party dynamics away from rampant nativism and marauding jingoism. Weld is no stranger to Trump’s rearview mirror, as he ran as the vice presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party in 2016 alongside former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson."

"ICE Reportedly Deported Spouse of Army Solider Killed in Afghanistan, Leaving Their Daughter Parentless",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/ice-reportedly-deported-spouse-of-army-solider-killed-in-afghanistan-leaving-their-daughter-parentless.html,"Why Nancy Pelosi Is So Comfortable Dismissing the Influence of AOC and Her Fellow Lefties The spouse of an American soldier killed in action in Afghanistan was arrested by ICE on the way to his job and deported last week despite being the father of a 12-year-old daughter who is an American citizen, the Arizona Republic reported Monday. The story is as horrific as it is familiar under the Trump administration, and the reported details are a reminder of the arbitrary and callous administration of the country’s immigration laws. Jose Gonzalez Carranza, now 30, came to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. He later married Army Pfc. Barbara Vieyra and had a daughter Evelyn . Vieyra was 22 years old when she was killed in 2010 while serving in the Army in Afghanistan. After her death, Gonzalez was granted what’s called parole in place, allowing him to stay in the country. Given his protected status, and lack of a criminal record, a judge later ended deportation proceedings against Gonzalez. In 2018, however, the Trump administration reopened the case and ordered a court hearing. But Gonzalez didn’t show for the court date because, he says, he never got the notice that ICE sent to the wrong address. The missed court appearance prompted a judge, in December, to order Gonzalez to be deported, but again he didn’t receive news of the order to dispute or correct it until ICE showed up at his door last Monday. By then it was too late and two days later Gonzalez was deported to Nogales, Mexico and living in a shelter for deported migrants. “I feel so bad,” Gonzalez said of being taken away from his daughter. “I’m thinking about, I might never see her again.” Making matters worse, his lawyer said Gonzalez filed a motion to reopen the deportation case after his arrest, which should have meant an automatic stay to his deportation proceeding. But ICE deported him anyway. “After speaking to The Arizona Republic , [the lawyer] said he received a call from an ICE officer who told him the agency was making arrangements to allow Gonzalez back into the U.S.,” the paper reported."
A Piece of Paris Goes Up in Flames,slate.com,Henry Grabar,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/a-piece-of-paris-goes-up-in-flames.html,"Notre Dame Cathedral Is on Fire: The Spire Has Collapsed, but the Towers Will Survive I was there the day Notre Dame burned. Well, not therein Paris, but immersed in the live-stream at my computer, where video after video after video whisked me around to see the burning cathedral from every angle, all afternoon. Each one arrived with an outdated timestamp, a reminder that the destruction was just a little more advanced than what I could see. I had to keep reminding myself I was looking into the past, like an astronomer watching a star explode. At about 10 p.m. Paris time, as Parisians sang Ave Maria in the firelight , Junior Interior Minister Laurent Nunez announced that the stone structure could be saved—the facade, the bell towers, the flying buttresses. Miraculously, the interior was nearly intact, including much of the rib-vaulted ceiling. But the roof and spire were lost. The fate of the windows and the organ is unknown. In The Hunchback of Notre Dame , Victor Hugo observed that the pace of change in Paris threatened the city’s character. “Monuments are becoming rarer and rarer, and one seems to see them gradually engulfed, by the flood of houses,” he wrote. “Our fathers had a Paris of stone; our sons will have one of plaster.” That call for preservation is a big theme of the book , whose success helped prompt a mid–19 th century restoration of the cathedral. The sentiment seems ridiculous today: Our Paris is a city that changes more slowly than the people who love it. Some people find that stasis smothering; I’ve always found it pleasantly humbling. Paris was there before I arrived, and it will be there after I’m gone. The fire marked a rupture and a reminder that the present can rise up to overpower the past. Construction on Notre Dame de Paris began in the middle of the 12 th century and went on for approximately a hundred years before it opened. But like most 850-year-old buildings, it’s a pastiche. During the French Revolution, the building was converted into a “Temple of Reason” and then a warehouse for wine storage. Its treasures were pillaged and its statues destroyed. “This central mother church is, among the ancient churches of Paris, a sort of chimera,” wrote Hugo in his famous novel. “It has the head of one, the limbs of another, the haunches of another, something of all.” Architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc brought new statues, gargoyles, and the famous spire to the cathedral in his restoration in the 1850s, remaking the historic edifice with his own vision. The cathedral didn’t stop there. Much of the stained glass dated from the 1960s. The bells were brand new. A new reconstruction campaign had recently gotten underway. Hugo deplored the dilapidation of the structure but stood in awe of the palimpsest. There is “…often the universal history of humanity in the successive engrafting of many arts at many levels, upon the same monument,” he went on. “The man, the artist, the individual, is effaced in these great masses, which lack the name of their author; human intelligence is there summed up and totalized. Time is the architect, the nation is the builder.” In one way, then, the rebuilding that is surely to come is just one link in the long chain of additions and subtractions that preceded it. A big, big link that will take a long time to fill in. Late into the night in Paris, the lattice of scaffolding—part of ongoing work on the structure, and, perhaps, the source of the fire—stood high over the ruined church."

"Merce Cunningham, in his own words, on movement and technology.",slate.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/merce-cunningham-in-his-own-words-on-movement-and-technology.html,"Copy this link and add it in your podcast app. copy link For detailed instructions, see our Slate Plus podcasts page . This month, the dance world is celebrating what would’ve been Merce Cunningham ’s 100 th birthday. For over a half-century, the American dancer and choreographer embraced innovation and expanded the frontiers of contemporary art, performing arts, visual arts, and music. Merce Cunningham dancers are famous for seeming to defy the laws of physics and gravity, leaping high into the air and then suddenly switching direction. “I always feel that my legs are like needles of a sewing machine when I’m doing Cunningham. They have to be very sharp and very articulate, and I feel that the torso has to be free on top of that,” says Daniel Roberts , who was a member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. “There’s a strain that comes along with doing the work and the technique and there’s a clarity about the work in general, the use of space, and the articulation of the torso and the limbs that I’ve never experienced before in any other dance form.” Cunningham’s legacy goes beyond dance and was seeded in his frequent collaborations with artists in other disciplines, such as musicians John Cage, Brian Eno, and Radiohead; artists Bruce Nauman, Andy Warhol, and Roy Lichtenstein; and costume designer Rei Kawakubo, among others. These stories were produced by Trey Kay and Kerrie Hillman. (Originally aired June 9, 2001, and April 27, 2002.) Studio 360 plugs:"
"The boring, Arial-dominated internet of the big platforms.",slate.com,Jane C. Hu,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/internet-fonts-custom-colors-myspace-arial-facebook.html,"“Because Science” Won’t Persuade Anyone to Vaccinate Their Kids In the days of dial-up internet, I identified my online friends in two ways: by their screen names, and by their font. I frequented X-Files chatrooms with regulars whose fonts I still remember more than 20 years later, though I remember little else about them: Jeff from Colorado used a bolded Lucida Sans in army green, and Emily from Fort Myers, Florida, used a hot pink Verdana, which, at the time, I thought was understated and very sophisticated. (We later became pen pals, and she also wrote me letters in that font.) My font of choice during that period was decidedly less sophisticated. I typed in a cerulean blue Comic Sans with a neon green highlight. If I’m being honest with myself, my taste never really improved, and for better or worse, I was able to plaster whatever I wanted all over my digital spaces. My old AOL website is a mess of colors and Mark Wahlberg photos, and I spent hours tinkering with HTML so that my LiveJournal displayed custom text announcing my comment counts and music selection. It boasted a Hot Topic–esque black-and-white checker theme with hot pink accents. Years later, on Tumblr, I still couldn’t resist the urge to make things my own. I frequently toggled between themes based on the aesthetic I wanted to convey that month. After an era where customizability was the norm, we’ve now reached a period where everything we read online looks the same. Blogging is dead, and the current dominant social media platforms have settled on a unified look: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages largely look the same. While Slack offers themes to change its default colors, and there are third-party apps to modify WhatsApp, there’s little you can do to change the look of messages you send. So, too, do the baby pictures, links, crowdfunding campaigns, and rants blend together as you scroll. I frequently mistake NIMBY posts in my neighborhood group for parody posts from a pro–public transportation meme group , or an ad for a friend’s vacation photo. Perhaps that’s the point: It’s a marketer’s dream for their ads to blend in with everything else—that’s why native advertising came into being. Is this post talking up a meal delivery service from a friend, or is it just the same ad for the 40 th time? My brain doesn’t really differentiate between those things while just scrolling through. It just absorbs the fact that I’ve seen it. To break up that sameness, we could return to the era of custom fonts or colors. Just as marketers embrace fonts to promote brands, perhaps individual users, too, might embrace the opportunity to select a font online that conveys their personality, or even just the tone of what they’re posting. In a 2012 study , researchers polled 102 people on which emotional descriptions—rested, stimulated, concerned, agitated, amused, etc.—they associated with each of 36 fonts. Arial was ranked highly for being organized and focused. It also happens to be the most used font on the internet: the default on Google, Facebook, Amazon, China’s QQ, and Twitter. It’s unclear whether its “organized, focused” appearance drove its popularity or whether its popularity shaped our perception of it, but either way, it conveys officialness, which seems to have become the default mode of so many of our posts now. The authors of the font analysis also discuss our love/hate relationship with one particular font. “No discussion of typeface emotion would be complete without some mention of Comic Sans,” they write. “The typeface sends viewers in all major emotional directions at once: we’re both agitated and amused, but calmly concerned about it. This is a distasteful feeling for many but other enjoy it, much as some hate riding a roller coaster and enjoy it.” Its fellow black sheep, Papyrus, evokes similarly divergent emotions but on a smaller scale. With so few ways to convey tone online, font choice could provide context. There’s no sarcasm font, but posting in Comic Sans or Papyrus could fill that niche. Similarly, being able to control font size or color could add nuance. Officialness has become the default mode of so many of our posts now. A pair of Japanese researchers apparently had this same pet theory and published a paper last year to test it. They designed a texting app with custom fonts and observed conversations between users. They found that typeface did indeed give context to the emotions of the texters. Whereas Arial, their neutral font, “evoked formal and business-like feelings” and conveyed positive emotion, use of “dramatic” fonts felt more intimate. An incongruence in font type and message—say, a font that looks befitting of a metal band saying “I am happy these days!”—is taken as sarcastic and humorous, leading the authors to conclude that font “will expand channels of nonverbal signals.” Granted, the participants in this study, all between the ages of 24 and 34, might be more online than the average person given their age and more accustomed to chatting online. Surely, not all users would interpret fonts in the same way as these folks, but the study shows how fonts could allow for additional nuance in our text conversations. Whether people would actually use custom fonts is another question. For users, fonts’ sameness has become the status quo, and people who deviate from the norms of posting are weirdos. MySpace is still the butt of jokes, after all, and I admittedly still feel a bit suspicious when someone emails me using a colorful or serifed font. Even when Facebook introduced the option to add background colors or patterns to text posts, people— tech media , in particular—were quick to declare them ugly . Still, people are finding little ways to bend the constraints of social media platforms. On Twitter, folks tweak their display names to appear upside down or in different fonts , or use ASCII art to stand out from the usual format. ( Every Sheriff is a wonderful and silly example of this.) And of course, there’s Snapchat and Instagram stories, which are an oasis of creativity. There, people seem more playful, a little freer to lean into their own styles, thanks to the ability to choose between texts, colors, GIFs, emoji, and filters allow for novel creations. There’s the sex educator who takes nude selfies but covers them up with stickers, the designer who layers text in two colors to give certain words a pop-out 3D effect, the tech employee that posts one phrase at a time so you’re tapping to read the next message. These posts take no more time than one on any other social media site, but they instantly convey a thousand times more personality. According to a 2017 Mashable post , part of why Facebook added custom backgrounds to text posts was a bid for more personality. It wanted to make the platform more fun as it competed with Snapchat for users. In the end, it seems that emulating the creativity of Snapchat was the best way to compete: TechCrunch reported that as of January, the function had 500 million daily users. If its success is any indication, users could be receptive to ways to break up the sameness on big platforms. I’m not saying our Facebook pages and Twitter profiles need to autoplay custom songs and display our Top 8 friends, but a little freedom to make our pages our own could go a long way."

Dallas assault of transgender woman investigated as a hate crime.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/dallas-assault-transgender-woman-hate-crime.html,"What Ilhan Omar’s Speech Really Meant The story of a transgender woman in Texas who was allegedly attacked Friday by a “mob” shouting homophobic slurs over a minor traffic accident took another turn when the man arrested for attacking her claimed he was paid $200 to commit the assault, according to Dallas police. In a video that circulated over the weekend, the victim, 23-year-old Muhlaysia Booker, is hit repeatedly by a man as a large crowd gathers near an apartment complex. After what appear to be multiple blows to her face, she falls to the ground. As people in the crowd scream for them to stop, a few other men begin kicking her and stomping on her. After Booker stumbles away, a group of women lift her up and, according to police, carry her to a car to take her to the hospital. She sustained injuries to her face, as well as a fractured wrist and a concussion. The man who punched her, later identified as 29-year-old Edward Dominic Thomas, was arrested Sunday night on aggravated assault charges. Thomas admitted to the assault, police said. Police said on Monday they have also identified a suspect who stomped on Booker’s face, but they had not yet arrested him, according to the Dallas Morning News . Police say that just before the attack, Booker had accidentally backed into another car. The driver of that car told police he ran Booker off the road to prevent her from leaving the scene. Booker told police that that man had pointed a gun at her and warned her not to leave without paying for the damage to his car. At that point, police say, Thomas says he was offered $200 by someone in the crowd to beat Booker. At the hospital, Booker told police that some of her assailants had used homophobic slurs during the attack. Dallas police said on Monday they are investigating whether the assault met the criteria of a hate crime and that they have contacted the FBI. In the meantime, police are looking at recordings from the scene to try to determine who else participated in the assault and who, if anyone, offered Thomas $200. They said they expect to make more arrests soon. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings on Saturday morning condemned the attack as an act of hate . “I am extremely angry about what appears to be mob violence against this woman,” he said in a statement. “Those who did this do not represent how Dallasites feel about our thriving LGBTQ community. We will not stand for this kind of behavior.”"

How Katie Bouman Shook Wikipedia,slate.com,Stephen Harrison,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/katie-bouman-wikipedia-page-deletion-black-hole.html,"India Is Leading the World in Internet Shutdowns Welcome to Source Notes , a Future Tense column about the internet’s knowledge ecosystem. Katie Bouman is a 29-year-old postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose Wikipedia article was created last Wednesday, when astronomers released the first-ever direct image of a black hole to the world. Bouman was an influential member of the Event Horizon Telescope team that captured this extraordinary photographic evidence. She was widely covered by the press after MIT tweeted a photo of her excitement upon seeing the image for the first time on her laptop. The timing of Bouman’s Wikipedia page makes sense: Pages are often created after a figure bursts into the news. What is unusual, though, is how much Bouman’s entry has been modified in this short period—more than 100 times per day by nearly 160 contributors. The frantic level of editing reflects the rapid mobilization by members of the online encyclopedia community to rescue Bouman’s page from deletion. The debate also shows how a minority of internet encyclopedists are more concerned with disputing individual merit than creating a reference source that serves the public interest. British physicist Jess Wade created Bouman’s Wikipedia page on April 10, coinciding with the black hole photo announcement. Two days later, the page was nominated for deletion . The few editors who argued adamantly that Bouman’s page should be deleted mostly said she lacked sufficient notability as an academic to have her own article. On the other side were those who said Bouman was clearly notable because of the vast amount of press coverage following the black hole announcement. Biologist Maryam Zaringhalam summarized the pro-article position well by tweeting , “Katie Bouman’s—one of the scientists behind the image of the black hole—Wikipedia article has been flagged as ‘not notable.’ If she’s not notable, then who TF is?!” After discussion and voting , the arguments for retaining Bouman’s Wikipedia page carried the day. The whole crisis was resolved within about 80 minutes, what Wikipedians refer to as a “ speedy keep .” This happened against the backdrop of a larger discussion about Bouman. After MIT tweeted the famous photo of her looking delighted, the university posted further tweets clarifying that she was part of a global collaboration of more than 200 scientists who made the discovery possible. Bouman likewise posted on Facebook that “no one algorithm or person made this image” and included a photo of the larger team. It was a similar argument to the one she made in her 2016 TED Talk : Big scientific discoveries are the work of big teams , not lone geniuses. By this point, though, the internet trolls had descended. The Verge’s Mary Beth Griggs recounts the online harassment in grim detail. Trolls set up fake Twitter accounts and fake Instagram accounts in Bouman’s name and had the fake Bouman claim that her colleague Andrew Chael wrote 850,000 of the 900,000 lines of code that were written into the algorithm that found the black hole. That’s when Chael himself chimed in , tweeting, “While I wrote much of the code for one of these pipelines, Katie was a huge contributor to the software; it would have never worked without her contributions.” Chael added that he hoped the “awful and sexist attacks” on Bouman would stop. Back on Wikipedia, a few in the pro-delete tweet camp were nasty and sexist. One editor pointed out that “as a young good looking woman she was much more attractive to the media” than the low-resolution photo of the black hole, and that the MIT scientist should only be covered as a “media phenomenon” since “sex sells.” On Twitter, another user falsely claimed that the only thing Bouman contributed was “changing fonts” in the code, suggesting that this was secretarial work that a high school student could handle. But there’s another type of pro-delete comment that’s worth examining and debunking. During the discussion, one editor arguing to delete Bouman’s page said this : “I am in fact a scientist with more publications & citations than Katie (though she is younger, so it’s not a fair comparison). … Was her work that important?” This comment is, in fact, highly revealing about how this editor views their role on Wikipedia. Rather than grounding notability in the scientific community, the press, or popular culture, this individual editor is holding to their own standards of comparative merit. But this type of personal vendetta and probable jealousy does not advance Wikipedia’s goal to be the sum of all human knowledge , which has certainly been advanced for the more than 350,000 people who have now visited and learned from Bouman’s page. I’m not the first to observe that the deletion debates on Wikipedia and other internet knowledge platforms frequently seem unproductive. Perhaps instead of fighting to remove someone’s encyclopedia entry, people should instead do something useful like, I don’t know, help photograph a black hole. Or, since that’s been done, maybe make a movie of one . Either way, it is no doubt better to search for dark despair vortexes elsewhere in the universe than to create them with our behavior online."

Trump 2020 campaign: Why the past few weeks have been a perfect preview of the next two years.,slate.com,Josh Voorhees,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-2020-reelection-campaign-preview-messaging.html,"What Ilhan Omar’s Speech Really Meant President Donald Trump suggested Monday that he will follow through on his threat to send migrants detained at the southern border to so-called sanctuary cities, a move he sees as a way to punish Democrats who disagree with his hard-line anti-immigration policies. The apparent executive-order-by-tweet came just days after he sent out a heinous propaganda video splicing images from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks into a speech by Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar. And that smear of one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress came about a week after Trump forced Kirstjen Nielsen out as secretary of homeland security, reportedly because she wasn’t cruel and lawless enough for his tastes. Taken together, Trump’s actions are xenophobic , dangerous , and possibly illegal . They also offer a particularly grim preview of what the next two years of his reelection campaign will look like. This sort of demagoguery has long been Trump’s default posture, but coming from a president with a, um, limited attention span, the recent burst almost looks like message discipline. Last month, Trump cut short his own “ Total EXONERATION ” victory lap by reigniting the debate over repealing Obamacare, much to the dismay of a Republican Party that got walloped on the issue in the midterms. He quickly retreated, promising to address the issue after the election. This month, he’s back to playing offense and to being more aggressively offensive. Instead of a bleak health care rematch, he’s focusing on what has worked before: claiming without evidence that the nation is under attack both at the border and from within it, stoking much of white America’s fear of the other while pitching himself as those Americans’ greatest defender. It would be a mistake to see this as a conscious shift to election mode by the president—Trump’s been campaigning for reelection on that theme since the moment he was sworn in—but the current barrage of nationalism is nonetheless a clear reminder of what’s to come. As president, Trump has a far bigger stage from which to air his race-based grievances than he did as a candidate. He will also have far more cash. Trump’s second presidential campaign won’t look exactly like his first one, but his team is already using the same brushes and paint : Make American Great Again will become Keep America Great . He’ll spend less time (but not no time) calling Hillary Clinton corrupt, and he’ll spend more time branding his possible Democratic challengers as reparations-loving socialists. His fans will chant, “Finish the wall,” instead of “Build the wall.” And he’ll once again smear Muslims, immigrants, Mexicans, and black Americans, but with a few fresh faces like Omar’s added to his cast of villains. As president, Trump has a far bigger stage from which to air his race-based grievances than he did as a candidate. He will also have far more cash. On the same day he delivered his “American carnage” inaugural address, he filed the paperwork to run for another term, an unprecedented move that allowed him to begin raising money immediately. He currently boasts a campaign war chest of $41 million, more than 20 times what Barack Obama had at this point in the 2012 cycle. Trump reported bringing in $30 million in the first three months of this year alone—or roughly the combined total of the two top Democratic raisers, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris. Meanwhile, GOP officials are doing all they can to clear the primary field, and while they haven’t been completely successful, it’s still a marked departure from four years ago, when Trump ran as an outsider and the establishment did everything in its power to derail him. Then, he told his base what he would do if he won the nomination and then the White House. Now, he’s pointing to those things he’s already doing with the GOP marching in lockstep behind him. The big difference between Trump 2016 and Trump 2020, then, isn’t the message, but the tense. There’s no reason to believe Trump will successfully stay on message between now and November 2020. Even amid this current xenophobic flurry, Trump hasn’t been able to stop himself from live-tweeting professional golf or playing armchair fire chief —and this week’s expected release of the Mueller report will attract his attention as well. But there’s also no reason to doubt that racial resentment will be the motivating force of his reelection effort. It has been the unifying theme of his politics since well before he cannonballed into the GOP primary four years ago this summer. This is the guy who laid the groundwork for his run by repeatedly claiming that the nation’s first black president had no right to be in the Oval Office, then kicked off his campaign with a jeremiad against Mexicans, and followed that up by calling for a Muslim ban . It should not have been a surprise that his inaugural address was littered with racism. Or that he proposed one version of a Muslim ban after another . Or that now he’s trying to twist the memory of 9/11 into an Islamophobic weapon against the nation’s first hijab-clad congresswoman. Trump told us who he was then, and he’s telling us who is he now.

Trump's sanctuary cities threat recalls the language of Qaddafi and Erdogan.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trumps-sanctuary-cities-migrants-qaddafi-erdogan.html,"What Ilhan Omar’s Speech Really Meant President Trump’s plan to release immigrant detainees on the streets of American sanctuary cities as a form of retaliation against his political enemies was reportedly the brainchild of White House adviser Stephen Miller. The logic behind it would also have made complete sense to Muammar Qaddafi. Libya has for years been a departure point for African migrants seeking to reach Europe, a fact that the country’s late strongman leader was more than willing to exploit. During a 2010 visit to Italy, Qaddafi demanded the EU pay Libya $6.3 billion a year to stop African migrants from reaching Europe. Otherwise, he said, he would turn Europe “black.” In remarks perfectly pitched to capitalize on European anxieties over immigration, he added: “We don’t know if Europe will remain an advanced and united continent or if it will be destroyed, as happened with the barbarian invasions.” Qaddafi wasn’t the only leader to play this game. Six years later, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to “ open the gates ” and allow the roughly 3 million refugees then living in his country to enter Europe. That came soon after the EU parliament voted to suspend talks on Turkey joining the EU. The EU had agreed to pay Turkeys billions of euros to prevent immigrants from entering the continent, but didn’t come through on other aspects of the agreement, including membership talks and visa-free travel for Turks in Europe, prompting Erdogan to accuse the Europeans of breaking their word. Now it is Trump who is trying to use migrant populations as leverage. On Tuesday, he tweeted , “Those Illegal Immigrants who can no longer be legally held (Congress must fix the laws and loopholes) will be, subject to Homeland Security, given to Sanctuary Cities and States!” White House officials have denied that this is a form of political retribution, but Trump has made it pretty clear that the intention is to “trigger the libs,” tweeting earlier, “The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy – so this should make them very happy!” The Washington Post has reported that “House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s district in San Francisco was among those the White House wanted to target” and that the White House also considered “releasing detainees in other Democratic strongholds.” Even if it was Miller’s idea, this ploy probably makes sense to Trump, as he seems to believe it’s already what’s being done to the U.S. He famously claimed , early in his presidential run, that “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best.” What’s striking here is not only the assumption that migration can only be a danger or a burden for the receiving country. It’s also that migrants and refugees in this view are not individuals, making decisions for the well-being or safety of themselves or their families. Instead, in this view, they are a collective quantity that governments “give,” “send,” or “release,” to each other. (It should be noted that even sympathetic advocates sometimes have a tendency to view global migration as a disembodied force or “human flow” to take the title of Ai Weiwei’s recent documentary .) Rather than addressing the political, economic, or environmental causes of migration, or crafting policies that would benefit both migrants and the communities that absorb them, leaders are opting instead to view immigration policy as a spigot to be turned on or off. These leaders sound less like they’re crafting social policy and more like they’re diverting a river to punish a town downstream. The spread of this kind of rhetoric doesn’t bode well for how governments will respond to a global population increasingly on the move. Support our journalism

"Trump’s 2020 campaign, Ilhan Omar, Pete Buttigieg and the Supreme Court, Notre Dame.",slate.com,Slate Copy Desk,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-2020-campaign-ilhan-omar-pete-buttigieg-supreme-court-notre-dame.html,"What Ilhan Omar’s Speech Really Meant The rest of the story: Rep. Ilhan Omar’s speech to the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Greater L.A. late last month has been the subject of much ire lately from Republicans like Rep. Dan Crenshaw and Donald Trump who say she was minimizing the memory of 9/11. Aymann Ismail looks past the sound bite to take in the speech in its entirety, finding a rousing assertion of Muslim American identity that’s only been elevated by the attacks. The brewing storm: In addition to his vitriolic tweet directed at Ilhan Omar, Trump has purged DHS staff members whom he thinks were too soft on immigration and threatened to flood sanctuary cities with detained migrants. All of this rhetoric is just a precursor to his 2020 campaign , Josh Voorhees predicts: With his elevated platform as president, Trump is likely hoping his xenophobia will register on a mass scale. Pete, my guy, do better: Many of the 2020 Democratic candidates have ideas for judicial reform, the most popular being court packing. The increasingly popular Mayor Pete has a different idea: an appellate rotation plan, which would mandate a relatively even partisan split and require judges to also pick fellow members from appeals courts. The problems with this? Well, it wouldn’t actually fix the problem the courts are facing right now , as Mark Joseph Stern explains, and also, it’s unconstitutional! From the ashes: Writer Lauren Collins, coincidentally, was on the roof of the Notre Dame Cathedral just last month reporting on its renovations. Today, she joined the Culture Gabfest to discuss the monument’s place in history, its evolution as a “living building” over the years, and how Monday’s fire will become a part of its vibrant palimpsest.

Cyberinsurance: Why won’t it cover many cyberattacks?,slate.com,Fred Kaplan,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/cyberinsurance-mondelez-merck-cyberattacks-hacks.html,"Mar-a-Lago Is a Foreign Spy’s Dream Come True You can buy insurance policies to cover damage from almost anything —dog bites, meteor showers, volcanic eruptions, stampeding cows. But if you’ve bought insurance against cyberattacks, which are among the most common and costly phenomena of our time, you may find it hard to collect on a claim. A few big corporations recently made this startling discovery, and two of them—Mondelez International and Merck Pharmaceutical—are suing their insurers. The cases may settle some uncertainties that no one has formally contemplated, much less resolved. If the court rules against the plaintiffs, the entire cyberinsurance industry—which was created 20 years ago but has only recently started to surge—may be abandoned by clients, and the already dismal state of cybersecurity may diminish still further. Here’s the background. In 2017, a piece of malware called NotPetya was inserted into a Ukrainian tax-software program, wiping out 10 percent of the country’s computers and shutting down vital infrastructure throughout the country before spreading to networks worldwide, crippling a host of multinational companies, including Mondelez, Merck, Maersk, FedEx’s European subsidiary, and Russia’s state oil company, Rosneft. That last one was ironic, as Western intelligence agencies concluded that the malware had been planted by the Russian government, as part of its harassment campaign against Ukraine. Mondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolates, filed a claim for $100 million in damages with the Zurich Insurance Group. Mondelez hadn’t taken out cyberinsurance per se, but its policy with Zurich did cover , among other things, “physical loss or damage to electronic data, programs, or software” as a result of “the malicious introduction of a machine code or instruction.” If the court rules against the plaintiffs, the already dismal state of cybersecurity may diminish still further. However, Zurich denied the claim, citing intelligence agencies’ verdict that NotPetya was part of a Russian attack on Ukraine, and referring to a clause in the company’s policy exempting coverage of damage caused by “hostile or warlike actions in time of peace or war.” Mondelez’s case against Zurich is proceeding in an Illinois court. Merck has filed a similar suit in New Jersey.The trials are likely to drag on for years because several key issues will have to be answered. The first might be: What is cyberwar? In 2006 , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, alarmed by the incessant briefings he was receiving on cyberattacks against the U.S. military and defense companies, asked the Pentagon’s general counsel at what point these attacks could be considered “acts of war” under international law. It took two years for the counsel’s office to respond and, even then, only evasively: Yes, the reply read, such attacks might be acts of war—but the precise circumstances were left vague. Second, to what extent can an intelligence agency’s judgment—the basis of which is probably classified—be cited to establish liability in a civil court case? Third, Mondelez’s lawyers are arguing that the war exclusion cannot be applied because the company and its transactions took place far from the Russia-Ukraine battlefield. But what are the battlefield’s boundaries in cyberspace? Is there even such a thing as a battlefield? Finally, as more (and more damaging) cyberattacks appear to be directed by national governments or their proxies, what is the point of having cyberinsurance if such attacks are excluded from coverage? This is the question that many clients will ask themselves if the insurers win these two cases. In other words, a tactical victory for the insurers could spawn a strategic defeat. “There’s a mad rush for insurance companies to write cyber policies,” says Bob Gourley, co-founder and chief technology officer of OODA LLC, a strategic advisory firm. But even when cyberattacks are not offshoots of war, the coverage offered by those companies is thin. According to Richard Clarke, CEO of Good Harbor Security Risk Management (and the White House cybersecurity chief during Bill Clinton’s presidency), these policies cover direct costs of a breach—the interruption of business, unauthorized credit card charges—and pay for subsequent credit monitoring and forensic teams. But the policies generally do not cover the much bigger losses of intellectual property, reputational damage, or theft of trade secrets. One reason is that the cyberinsurance business began 20 years ago, when attacks were seen mainly as nuisances inflicted by malicious hackers rather than a threat to economic infrastructure and national security, much less a new “domain” of international conflict. As a result of its booming demand and its limited payouts, cyberinsurance is a highly profitable branch of the industry. However, from the standpoint of insurers, the proliferation of attacks and the size of the targets have started to outgrow their ability to reimburse the enormous damage that such attacks can inflict. If cyberinsurance is to become a serious piece of both insurance and cybersecurity, a total rethink is required. The model, up till now, has been hazard insurance, but a better model might be health insurance. When you buy hazard insurance, you’re insuring yourself against the slim possibility of a fire or a flood; when you buy health insurance, you’re insuring yourself against the near certainty of eventual injury or illness. If you run certain sorts of businesses, cyberattacks are a near certainty—and, in some cases, potentially fatal. This means that real cyberinsurance, like health insurance, is going to be expensive. But a real insurance market can also provide incentives for improving cybersecurity. Just as medical and life insurance policies offer discounts for people who don’t smoke or keep healthy regimens, cyberinsurance policies could do the same for corporations that maintain “good hygiene” or follow “best practices” in computer security. Back in the mid- to late 1990s, when senior U.S. officials became aware that the internet was catastrophically vulnerable, some of them (notably Richard Clarke) advocated mandatory cybersecurity requirements for firms and government agencies involved in “critical infrastructure”—finance, transportation, electrical grids, water supply, emergency services, and so forth. The companies lobbied feverishly against the proposals. Even some Cabinet secretaries, who didn’t yet grasp the full scope of the risks, worried that “excess regulation” would stifle innovation and competitiveness. The resistance won. Even subsequent presidential orders, which at first glance seem to impose security requirements, lack enforcement clauses; they’re, in effect, nonbinding finger wags and brow furrows. In the absence of regulations, maybe market incentives can take us part of the way toward cybersecurity. But if the insurance companies succeed in claiming war exemptions in the two cases on trial now, the last route toward even a partial solution might be closed off. Support our journalism

Beto O'Rourke and 2020 Democratic candidates need to give more to charity.,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/beto-orourke-democratic-candidates-tax-returns-charitable-giving.html,"How Bad Is Aunt Incest, Really? Who would have guessed that Beto O’Rourke was a total Scrooge? The Democratic 2020 hopefuls have started releasing their tax returns in the name of transparency (how quaint!), and among other information about their finances, it’s giving us an opportunity to learn a bit about their charitable giving habits—which in some cases are frankly a bit stingy. Credit to the Washington Post for scouring the candidates’ returns for this info, which they published on Tuesday. First, here’s how much of their total income candidates gave away, from most generous to least. All numbers are for last year, unless otherwise noted. • Elizabeth Warren : 5.5 percent.The senator from Massachusetts and her husband gave $50,000 on $906,000 in income. • Jay Inslee : 4.1 percentThe Washington governor and his wife gave $8,295 on $203,000 in income. • Bernie Sanders : 3.4 percentThe Vermont senator and his wife gave $19,000 on $566,000 in income. Sanders told the Post that total did not include proceeds he gave away from his book but did not claim as deductions on his taxes. We’ll have to take him on his word. • Amy Klobuchar : 1.9 percentThe Minnesota senator and her husband gave $6,600 on $338,500 of income. • Kirsten Gillibrand : 1.7 percentThe New York senator and her husband gave $3,750 on $215,000 of income. • Kamala Harris: 1.4 percentThe California senator and her husband gave $27,000 on $1.9 million of income. • Beto O’Rourke: 0.31 percent.No, you are not reading that wrong. In 2017, the most recent return he’s released, the former Texas representative and his wife gave just $1,166 on $370,412 of income, less than 1 percent of what they earned. So, O’Rourke’s number is self-evidently terrible. I thought maybe it was just one bad year, but alas, no. In 2016 , he and his wife donated $857, or 0.25 percent of their income. In 2015 , they gave $867, or 0.24 percent of their income. Not great, Beto. But as for the other candidates? For their income, Sanders, Inslee, and Warren are all somewhat above average givers by U.S. standards. The others are a bit below average. Based on IRS data, the Tax Policy Center shows that Americans who earn between $100,000 and $500,000 contribute about 2.9 percent of their adjusted gross income to charity; those who earn between $500,000 and $2 million give about 3.1 percent. (The Post’s calculations are based on total income, not AGI, which is your income after subtracting away certain deductions. The candidates’ giving would probably be slightly higher as a percentage of AGI, but you still get the idea.) Tax Policy Center These figures do need a few caveats. First, they only cover people who itemize their taxes and took the charitable deduction, which is only about a quarter of taxpayers. There are lots of people who give to charity but take the standard deduction who won’t show up in these figures. Also, you might notice that people who make under $50,000 seem to donate the most in this table relative to their income. But the figures in that income bracket are probably a bit skewed, since it includes some relatively well-off business owners whose companies have a bad year, with the losses showing up in their personal taxes. So take that bit with a grain of salt. Point being: O’Rourke needs to up his giving game. I know. Maintaining a dual residence in Washington and Texas is probably expensive. But offer some money for your local food bank or homeless shelter, man. Also, in case you’re looking for a quick, more detailed guide to what you should give to charity each year, here’s a more detailed list of average charitable contributions by income bracket drawn from the IRS’s data. See if you measure up better than the O’Rourkes. Jordan Weissmann"
Fosse/Verdon fact vs. fiction Episode 2: What’s true in FX’s new series starring Michelle Williams and Sam Rockwell.,slate.com,Ellin Stein,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/fosse-verdon-fact-fiction-episode-2-historical-accuracy-fx-series.html,"What’s Fact and What’s Fiction in On the Basis of Sex The second episode of Fosse/Verdon offers a sophisticated, time-traveling, bittersweet depiction of a marriage from early rapture to late-stage battle-scarred disillusionment. To do this, it cuts between Gwen Verdon and Bob Fosse’s incendiary affair during rehearsals for Damn Yankees and the end of the relationship on a beach in Majorca, where Fosse discovers that Verdon has finally had enough and the old tricks and manipulations won’t work anymore. While the show’s premiere focused on the more familiar, sex-and-decadence Fosse of Cabaret , this episode evokes the choreographer’s more exuberant 1950s style, when he worked on that vanished subspecies, the blue-collar Broadway musical. How closely does it stick to the real-life story of the couple’s first meeting and final dissolution? We break it all down below. Meeting on Damn Yankees In the episode, producer Hal Prince (Evan Handler) tells Verdon that he’s engaged Fosse as choreographer and that Fosse wants to go over some steps with her. Verdon, a hot star six months after winning the Tony for Can-Can , is furious that Fosse wants her to, in effect, audition, telling Prince, “If I don’t like him, you’ll be looking for a new choreographer.” At the studio, Fosse begins teaching Verdon the number , and over the course of working out the steps, the two discover their creative synergy, with Verdon adding her own quirky, humorous touches. She is shocked but intrigued by Fosse’s adding striptease moves and they exchange confidences about their time working in burlesque houses as teenagers. In reality, Verdon had already encountered Fosse socially a few times, although they had never worked together. Nevertheless, it is true that they were in fact wary of working together. “ I don’t know her. How do I know we can work together? ” Fosse asked Prince , while Verdon recalled that she had a reputation for being difficult. “I was difficult because I couldn’t stand bad dancing,” she told cable station CUNY TV in 1991. But, as in the show, her fears were allayed once he started showing her the number. “He was fantastic doing it. It was Lola,” she recalled. “It had such sex appeal and yet it was so funny.” A dance style that was at once very sexy and knowingly humorous became the team’s trademark. Fosse did work in burlesque theaters as a young teenager, as explored in last week’s episode , but it’s less clear that Verdon did so, although she was already dancing professionally in clubs and in movies at 11. The Other Mrs. Fosse A photo of Joan McCracken from her appearance in Dance Me a Song, and Susan Misner as Joan McCracken in Fosse/Verdon . Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Bruno of Hollywood/Wikipedia and Pari Dukovic/FX. In the episode, the lithe and vibrant Verdon is contrasted with Fosse’s elegant but ailing wife, actress Joan McCracken (Susan Misner), who is trying to keep the debilitating effects of her diabetes secret lest producers be scared off. Verdon, meanwhile, is intimidated by McCracken’s reputation as a serious actress. At the opening night of Damn Yankees , McCracken runs into Verdon in a powder room and tells her that when she met Fosse, he was married to his first wife, another dancer, whom he left for McCracken. She also says she was the one who got Fosse his first job as a choreographer, although he’s never thanked her. Fosse, meanwhile, tells Verdon he can’t leave McCracken. But McCracken soon leaves him and he moves in with Verdon. Fosse’s second wife, Joan McCracken, was indeed a serious actress, and she did indeed try to keep her diabetes secret, but she was primarily known for her talents as a dancer and a comedienne—quite a lot like Verdon (she also mentored another performer with these same talents, Shirley MacLaine). She came to fame dancing in a featured ballet role in Oklahoma! , although she also established herself as a straight dramatic actress in Charles Laughton’s 1947 production of Bertolt Brecht’s Life of Galileo . It really was McCracken who got Fosse his first Broadway choreography job, recommending him for The Pajama Game to her friend George Abbott, the immensely successful and respected director. The couple had met when they were both appearing in a 1950 revue called Dance Me a Song , when Fosse was still married to his first wife, Mary Ann Niles, with whom he had a double act tap-dancing on various TV shows. Fosse and McCracken got closer when they appeared together in a touring company production of Pal Joey , and when Fosse subsequently got an MGM contract, it was McCracken who went with him to Hollywood. It was also McCracken who encouraged him to take acting classes at the American Theatre Wing. “I was very show biz, all I thought about was nightclubs, and she kept saying, ‘You’re too good to spend your life in nightclubs,’ ” Fosse told the New York Times. “She lifted me out of that, and I’ll always be grateful,” though not so grateful he didn’t leave McCracken on her own (she didn’t leave him) despite her suffering two heart attacks during the run of Damn Yankees . He didn’t move in with Verdon—they maintained separate apartments—but their relationship was an open secret until Fosse finally divorced McCracken in 1957. He had been waiting for her to be released from a facility where she’d gone to recover from a breakdown. The “Who’s Got the Pain?” Snit Fit Bob Fosse and Sam Rockwell. Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Alix Jeffry/ Wikipedia and Craig Blankenhorn/FX. The episode shows Fosse having a complete meltdown when Abbott and Prince suggest cutting a number during Damn Yankees ’ New Haven tryouts, possibly because Fosse had given himself a part in the number. The situation is compounded when, listening through the thin walls of a hotel room, Fosse overhears the two saying the number has to go. He threatens to quit. The next day, composer Richard Adler comes up with a replacement number based on the mambo, a Latin dance craze then popular with the same middle-class audiences who went to Broadway musicals, and Fosse comes up with a comedic-but-sexy number that perfectly showcases Verdon’s talents. This is all true, including Fosse’s listening through the wall and his furious response to hearing Abbott and Prince say they thought the original number was terrible.

Many years later, after discovering her husband in flagrante with the Cabaret shoot’s translator, Verdon heads to celebrated playwright Neil Simon’s idyllic property in Majorca, where she has a heart-to-heart with her close friend Joan Baim Simon (Aya Cash), a former dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company who, like Verdon, has given up her dancing career to raise her family. Fosse pleads with Verdon to stay with him, even though, as he admits, he’s in love with the translator. This is all accurate. Fosse and Verdon did stop living together after the Cabaret shoot. The final straw was Verdon discovering him in bed with two German girls, although she had already received a letter from the translator’s furious husband revealing all. Moreover, even before Fosse got the Cabaret job in 1970, the marriage was in dire condition. “I think Bob outgrew me,” she told the New York Times in 1981. “Bob started writing and he was involved in all kinds of things, and I was so involved with Nicole [their daughter] I didn’t really care if I worked or not. … He began to think, ‘Oh, you’re my wife.’ I hated that.” According to Sam Wasson’s biography of Fosse , after the production wrapped, Fosse was spending a post-shoot week in Madrid with the translator when he started having second thoughts. He called Verdon, who agreed to come to Simon’s rented villa. Verdon and Joan Simon were indeed close, and Fosse and Simon had collaborated on Little Me in 1962 and then again on Sweet Charity in 1966, with Simon subsequently serving as Fosse’s unofficial sounding board on scripts. The reconciliation failed, with Verdon returning to New York and their daughter and Fosse to the translator."

Columbine High School and more than 20 other schools across Denver’s Jefferson County, which encompasses the western flank and suburbs of the city were put on “lockout” in response to reports that Pais was in the area and attempting to buy firearms. “Less serious than a lockdown, a lockout means that activity inside the schools will continue as scheduled, but entry and exit is restricted,” the Denver Post reports . “A bulletin sent to local police said authorities do not have probable cause to arrest Pais, but that she should be detained for a mental-health evaluation.” The Colorado Department of Education issued a recommendation that all schools in the Denver metropolitan area undertake similar lockout procedures.

Even now, twenty years later, the high school is an object of morbid fascination for disturbed individuals and routinely receives threats of all sorts. As a result the Jefferson County school district has a highly trained security along with one of the most comprehensive security systems in the country to ensure that students and teachers remain safe. “As the district prepares for the day’s memorial events, it is fending off an onslaught of curious strangers who trespass in the school’s parking lot— sometimes more than 30 people in a single day,” the Washington Post reports . “The district has also seen an increase in threats and concerning messages, which often come in the form of emails to the school or phone calls to the 24-hour dispatch center run by the district’s security team.”"

Trump administration to allow for extended detention of certain asylum seekers as deterrent to others not to come.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/barr-trump-order-asylum-seekers-migrants-immigration-parole-bail-bond.html,"Is Brooklyn’s Gun Court Getting Weapons off the Streets—or Just Locking Up More Young Black Men? Attorney General William Barr issued an order Tuesday evening that will stop certain credible asylum seekers from being able to post bail while they await their asylum hearings, a process that can take months and sometimes years. The practical effect of the order directed at immigration judges is that it could keep thousands of asylum seekers detained for extended periods while they await a court ruling on their status. The move is the latest explicit effort by the Trump administration to discourage legal asylum seekers from attempting to come to the country by erecting administrative roadblocks and potentially jail time. “For more than a decade, migrants who are deemed to have a ‘credible fear’ of persecution in their home countries have been allowed to request a bond hearing so they can be released on bail while they wait for their asylum cases to be heard, sometimes months or years later,” the New York Times notes . This is an approach that has been affirmed by the judicial system as recently as this month when a federal judge in Washington State affirmed that credible asylum seekers must have the ability to seek bail within seven days of requesting it. The attorney general, however, oversees the immigration courts and Barr is restricting the class of asylum seekers that can rely on that week-long time frame. The order gives the Department of Homeland Security wide discretion over whether migrants who declared themselves as asylum seekers after entering the country illegally will be released on bail or not. The Trump administration, unsurprisingly, has dramatically curtailed the release of migrants awaiting immigration proceedings. The order restricting migrants’ access to parole does not apply to potential asylum seekers that declare themselves at a port of entry along the border. Given the difficulties that already overworked government agencies have had imposing stiffer immigration regulations, it’s doubtful the administration has the capacity to house thousands more migrants for extended periods of time. Barr, on Tuesday, acknowledged as much saying he will defer the implementation of the new rules. “I will delay the effective date of this decision for 90 days so that D.H.S. may conduct the necessary operational planning for additional detention and parole decisions,” Barr wrote in the 11-page order."

Showtime If we ever repair the damage former Fox News head Roger Ailes did to the United States, it will be decades from now, after time and actuarial tables slowly sweep the people whose minds he poisoned off the board. There’s some consolation in the fact that a man who made the world so much worse spent the last year of his life in disgrace , but that was a fate Ailes earned through his years of sexual misconduct in the workplace; it didn’t really address what the workplace he ran was designed to accomplish, or any of the work he spent his life doing. In some parts of the world, when someone who did well by doing bad dies, their statues get torn down, but Ailes doesn’t have any—and even if he did, we still haven’t managed to tear down the statues of people who lost a war fought to preserve slavery more than a century ago, so that’s not a promising avenue to pursue. Truth and reconciliation commissions aren’t really our thing either, nor are reparations, nor are repairs. But there’s one thing we do better than any other country: produce biopics in which A-listers dramatically transform their appearance to look just as terrible as the world’s greatest villains. Showtime released a teaser for their upcoming series The Loudest Voice on Tuesday, and it looks like it fits squarely in the tradition of wrecking-ball biopics of terrible presidents like Vice , Nixon , and Bedtime for Bonzo . Please enjoy everything they had to do to Russell Crowe’s face before he began to resemble Roger Ailes: The Loudest Voice, a limited series adaptation of Gabriel Sherman’s Ailes biography The Loudest Voice in the Room , will premiere on Showtime on June 30 and run for eight episodes.

Conan O'Brien: The late night host learns about Australia's deadliest animals.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/conan-obrien-australia-most-dangerous-animals-kangarooaroo-kangarooarooaroo-kangarooarooarooaroo-crocodonkey.html,"The dreaded crocodonkey. TBS Conan O’Brien has a new remote special coming to TBS on Wednesday, and this one is about the country so nice that although they only named it once, they used that name for an entire continent: Australia. On Tuesday, he gave his audience a preview of the upcoming show, which features a slightly embarrassed naturalist explaining the anatomy of echidna penises, and a not-embarrassed-at-all Conan running around on an Australian rules football field looking like he just lost a fight with a vampire. But the highlight was a back-and-forth he had about Australia’s deadliest animals with an Australian who just happened to be in the studio audience: The world needs more comedy that comes from Megan-Amram-style pun brainstorms , and it also needs more comedy in which artists create modern Jackalopes in Photoshop. This sketch has both! Even more importantly, however, it introduces the world to the concept of the kangarooaroo, a kangaroo with a kangaroo for a head. There probably wasn’t time in a single Conan sketch to mention kangarooarooaroos (either a kangarooaroo with a kangaroo for a head or a kangaroo with a kangarooaroo for a head, depending on how you look at it), much less wade into the centuries-long argument between recursive kangarooaroologistologists as to whether or not a kangarooarooarooaroo is best described as a kangaroo with a kangarooarooaroo for a head, a kangarooaroo with a kangarooaroo for a head, a kangarooarooaroo with a kangaroo for a head, or—the most controversial theory of all—an arooarooarooaroo with a kang for a body. Still, even in such a short timeframe, Conan gets his point across: Australia is deadly and terrifying and we are all better off leaving it alone. He’ll explore this theme in more detail Wednesday night at 10 on TBS; please avoid the continent until that time. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

Queer nightlife culture and chronic illness: How one lesbian made peace with the needs of her body.,slate.com,Jacy Topps,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/queer-nightlife-scene-chronic-illness-community.html,"“Leather” Usually Conjures Images of Butch Gay Men. But a Gender-Inclusive Scene in L.A. Is Creating Its Own Kinky Magic. You’ve probably heard of the idea of a queer “scene,” perhaps most often from people who don’t care for it. But what, exactly, is this scene? Who’s a part of it? Who isn’t? Who decides? Is there more than one? What happens when a scene evolves—or when it doesn’t? These are the questions we’ve gathered a group of writers to consider for an Outward special issue on “the Scene” in LGBTQ life today. You can read all of the stories in the issue here , and you can listen to a full episode of the Outward podcast covering more of the queer scene by subscribing on iTunes , Spotify , or wherever you get your audio . In my late 20s, on the brink of coming out as a lesbian, I did what most “baby queers” eager to connect to their people usually do: I turned my nascent identity into a research project. I read all the books on queer history, coming out essays, and articles on hookup culture in an effort to discover where to find other lesbians like me. The consensus: gay bars and dance clubs. In retrospect, this wasn’t exactly surprising. Bars and underground dance parties have historically played a pivotal role in the queer community and our culture, providing a safe space to meet and hook up with other queers. Constantly harassed, assaulted, and discriminated against in mainstream spaces, LGBTQ individuals needed raves, private parties, and gay bars in order to firm up their communities and escape societal persecution. When the community finally decided to fight back after decades of mistreatment and police brutality, the first punches were thrown in spaces like the Stonewall Inn, site of the famous 1969 riot that we’re now commemorating 50 years later as a milestone in the march toward equality. And it was in the literal debris of these clashes that queers gathered to organize the social movements that have yielded so much fruit today. So when I walked into my first divey queer bar, named My Sister’s Room, in Atlanta, it was a big moment. I went by myself, which was intimidating at first. But it quickly started to feel like home. I met women there who identified as butch, femme, and everything in between. I no longer had to hide who I was. It felt safe and magical. From those first steps, I grew to love socializing, dancing, and having a few cocktails with other queers, particularly queer women. There’s something special in knowing there’s a dedicated space to be your most authentic self, where you can give into your kinks, speak freely about your relationships, be entertained by fabulous drag performers, and openly express your gender and sexuality. West to East Coast, no matter where I’ve lived or visited, I have always been down for exploring the queer neighborhoods, bars, and dance parties. In Atlanta, it’s Mary’s in the East Atlanta Village. When I lived in San Francisco, I was a fixture in the Castro and also frequented the famous Lexington Club before it permanently closed.And when I moved to New York City, you could routinely find me dancing at Henrietta Hudson or enjoying drink specials at my favorite lesbian dive bar, Cubbyhole. It was in these spaces that I developed some friendships that lasted a short while and some that I believe will last a lifetime. At these queer bars, I kissed women, sang along to their jukeboxes, listened to my favorite DJs spin, and met a couple of one-night stands. These are memories that I will always cherish. But regrettably, I haven’t been able to go out as much as I would like recently, not to late-night parties anyway. On the surface, my queer friends probably assume it’s because I’m more settled in a relationship and celebrating my 40 th birthday in a few months. However, the truth is I’ve reached a point in my life where I’m not able to do some of the things I use to. On any given day, I suffer from chronic pain and fatigue, anxiety, insomnia, depression, and other mental illnesses; these overlap to affect every area of my life. My depressive periods heighten my anxiety, making large crowds and loud music unnerving. My chronic anxieties manifest physically, sometimes causing migraines, panic attacks, and debilitating pain throughout my body. And on most days, I’m completely exhausted due to my chronic insomnia. Sometimes I also worry about being condemned to a boring, heteronormative life. Despite all this, sometimes the mood does strike, and I feel like going out. But when I start thinking about the crowds, the two-day hangovers, the anxiety, fatigue, and pain I will inevitably feel later, I decide to stay in and watch a movie instead. To add insult to injury, my wife — who was also heavy into queer nightlife — suffers from some of these symptoms as well, and oftentimes, we’re not on the same page. When she feels healthy and wants to go out to a late-night dance party, those are usually the nights when I don’t. We don’t necessarily have to go out clubbing together. But if one of us isn’t up to it, we usually both stay in. And so my chronic illnesses hurt me in ways beyond their immediate symptoms. They leave me feeling isolated, left behind, and disconnected from the community, and the guilt of not actively supporting queer establishments can be hard to shake off, particularly since bars for lesbians and female-identified queers have been increasingly shutting down . Sometimes I also worry about being condemned to a boring, heteronormative life devoid of the loving, beautiful, diverse, and resilient community I’m proud to be a part of. While there’s nothing wrong with wanting a more traditional lifestyle—a house in the suburbs and children—my idea of queer culture has always been unapologetically radical. From the transgressive ways queer femmes express their identities to networks like the Radical Faeries, I appreciate the ways in which many in the queer community intentionally reject assimilating to straight culture. I try not to be too hard on myself about all this. After all, my fade from the scene is not just about my chronic ailments—there are structural factors in play too. As a black woman, my decision not to attend every party has an economic component. Research shows that not only do black women make less money than both white men and women, but we also suffer from depression at higher rates . And to make matters worse, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, black people have less access to quality mental health care due to stigma and the cost of health insurance. After insurance premiums, out-of-pocket payments, copays, and medication, sometimes there’s just not enough money for me to go out even if I felt up to it. So how do I find a way to keep queer community in my life that puts my body and mental health first? A couple of years ago, I started attending queer potluck dinner parties, yoga, pop-up pool parties, brunches, tea parties, reading and writing groups, fashion shows, community BBQs, and art exhibitions on a more regular basis. These types of events and places are nothing new as activities. But what makes them special is their intentional queerness, prioritizing and celebrating queer-identified people and their allies. For me, these events and queer spaces are usually more intimate, less crowded, more inclusive to femmes and people of color, less anxiety-inducing, generally earlier in the day, and easier on my body. From time to time, when I’m feeling relatively healthy, I do venture out to support my favorite queer bars, DJs, drag performers, and promoters, paying my respects to our sacred institutions and their place in our extraordinary history. But I’ve learned to let go of the guilt when I can’t make it and to embrace gratitude for the growing diversity of queer scenes, especially for the people within our community living with chronic illnesses and other disabilities. Because when it comes to being with chosen family, it’s the people, not the time of day or the venue, that matters. "
India is leading the world in internet shutdowns.,slate.com,Subhodeep Jash,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/india-internet-shutdowns-digital-authoritarianism-democracies.html,"This article originally appeared in the New America Weekly . The past decade has seen a staggering decline around the world in digital freedom, as the human rights nonprofit Freedom House underscored in a report last year. China has largely taken center stage in this decline narrative, thanks to tools like its social credit system and facial recognition technology , which allow the country to shrink personal freedoms, especially those of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang . Not to be left behind, Russia also has recently announced its plan to “unplug” the country from the internet. And in March, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a “fake news” law that will severely limit online speech for its citizens. But while observers have kept a steady eye on these admittedly unsurprising curbs on digital rights in countries like China and Russia, an overlooked method of digital repression—internet shutdowns—is most rampant not in an authoritarian regime, but in the world’s largest democracy: India. According to a Software Freedom Law Center tracker , there have been more than 300 reported shutdowns in India over the past six years. (And these are just the incidents that have been reported; it’s likely that there have been more.) This data point makes India the leading country for internet shutdowns globally, even surpassing countries like Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It challenges the prevailing assumption that digital authoritarianism is only a problem in authoritarian countries. The government grounds its shutdown authority in a statutory relic from the colonial era. First, though, it’s important to understand what, exactly, an internet shutdown is. Per the international nonprofit Access Now, an internet shutdown “happens when someone—usually a government—intentionally disrupts the internet or mobile apps to control what people say or do.” Put another way, these shutdowns—or “blackouts” or “kill switches”—represent an extreme form of network control and government censorship of a country’s own population. Some of the earliest and most prominent cases of internet shutdowns across the planet arose during explosive political events. In 2005, Nepal shut down its entire telecommunications network during a coup d’état. In 2011, Egypt witnessed shutdowns in the thick of the Arab Spring protests. And in India, some of the first reported cases of shutdowns occurred in the conflict-torn regions of Jammu and Kashmir, where mobile services were jammed as a security measure prior to Republic Day celebrations in January 2010. But it’s been since 2012 that regional governments in India have really ramped up efforts to rein in the digital freedoms increasingly fueled by technology. This has stemmed at least in part from the number of internet users surging to more than 100 million, with many first-time users, especially users of mobile internet, quickly picking up on its potential as a source of information. In this light, the rapid increase in the number of shutdowns in India over the past several years speaks to a deeper state desire to exercise control over a medium that has dramatically increased citizens’ connectivity and access to information within and beyond the country’s borders. More broadly still, the shutdowns point to the fact that democracies and hybrid regimes—the latter of which feature elements of both democratic and autocratic governments—aren’t immune to internet blackouts. In 2017 alone, India accounted for about 70 percent of shutdowns globally , and this phenomenon has had corrosive effects on Indian society. (It’s important to mention here that, given its size compared with countries like Syria, Iraq, Pakistan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, India also has a lot more internet to shut down.) The government metes out shutdowns via executive orders and decrees (sometimes issued verbally), which local or regional authorities initiate. This legal maneuvering is often directed at telecommunications companies, and administrators see it as a quick fix (even preemptively) to what they deem a law-and-order or national security issue. Importantly, the government also grounds its shutdown authority by referencing the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 , a statutory relic from the colonial era. While initially intended to regulate India’s telegraph system, over the decades it has been expanded to encompass the entire sphere of telecoms, and it now includes a provision to impose “curfews” for both physical and online spaces in the event of an emergency. Further, in 2017, the state introduced the Internet Shutdown Rules , which grant regional and federal governments temporary suspension powers for mobile services during emergencies. As mentioned above, these shutdowns are sometimes justified on the grounds of security. This was true for shutdowns in Kashmir in the wake of violent protests after the death of a separatist leader, Burhan Wani, in 2016, and in Gujarat that same year following civil agitation over affirmative action quotas on education and public jobs. But too often, flimsy or rash reasoning guides the decision to trigger a shutdown, as was the case with several incidents in Rajasthan last year to prevent cheating on examinations . In terms of the proportionality principle under international law—which, in this particular case, means that any restriction on internet access must also be the “least intrusive instrument”—these irresponsible kill-switch responses reveal regional governments’ penchant for overreaction, rather than a willingness to reasonably deal with an issue. This disproportionate state response matters because it can come with costs, both social and economic. Observers can see the former because misused internet shutdowns can affect individuals’ ability to express even unpopular opinions freely—a right enshrined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed in a 2012 Human Rights Council declaration , which extended protections to both offline and online spaces. Consider how, in September 2012, after a viral video began to anger Muslims in the Kashmir Valley, the regional government of Jammu and Kashmir ordered telecommunications companies to restrict access to YouTube and Facebook there. But the telecom operators chose to overcomply, and they disrupted access to the entire internet, rather than to specific websites. While done for the sake of security—protests erupted as the video circulated—it isn’t a stretch to see how this overly broad latitude could be used to censor any opinion perceived as unpopular. As for the economic cost, a recent study on shutdowns in India—conducted by the think tank ICRIER —finds that, from 2012 through 2017, 16,315 shutdown hours cost the country’s economy approximately $3.04 billion. This is hardly ideal for a country that yearns to cement its place as a major power on the international stage. On top of that, a shutdown goes directly against the government’s Digital India initiative, which attempts to promote a cashless economy. This is because a cornerstone of the e-commerce industry is access to open and reliable internet. (Notably, an Indian ride-hailing operator, Ola Cabs, has created an “ offline ” variation of its app for areas that experience intermittent internet connectivity.) While India’s internet shutdowns may not be the worst instances of the phenomenon, the blackouts there raise concerns about where the country might be going in the years ahead. As the government looks to expand preexisting telecoms regulation, it’s prudent to ask whether it will eventually craft internet-specific legislation, as well as what that legislation may look like. After all, India’s dalliance with regulations that seek to control the free flow of information online doesn’t seem to be ending with shutdowns. Recently, it floated a new set of intermediary guideline rules that look to curb the misuse of social media platforms and the spread of fake news. A February New York Times report called this a “Chinese-style internet censorship” approach. More than ever, it’s become increasingly clear that this sort of “ networked authoritarianism ” is on display in India. Indeed, though India may be an outlier among the usual shutdown suspects, it may also offer a crucial warning of how blackouts can occur in other fragile and hybrid democratic regimes."

Beyonce's Homecoming live album has two new songs.,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/beyonces-homecoming-new-songs-coachella-album.html,"The Only Good Thing Left About Game of Thrones Is Its Fan Theories Fans were already prepared for Wednesday to be an unofficial Bey-day. We knew that April 17 marked the release of Beyoncé’s new documentary Homecoming , which would include a full version of the singer’s 2018 Coachella performance (aka Beychella) along with a behind-the-scenes peek to let us revel a little more in the historic headlining show. But Beyoncé has always been a master of the surprise release, and we should’ve known that she’d have an extra gift up her sleeve this time, too. Early Wednesday morning, Bey capped off the Netflix debut with an accompanying live album, also called Homecoming , that includes two fresh bonus tracks: “Before I Let Go” and “I Been On.” Neither track is totally new—”Before I Let Go” is a cover of a 1981 song by Frankie Beverly and Maze, and “I Been On” is an alternate studio version of the Beychella song—but for fans, new Beyoncé is a cause for celebration. As it turns out, “Before I Let Go” isn’t totally new to Beyoncé’s orbit—nor to, as Essence put it , any “cookout, not a wedding or family reunion in Black America”. Variety reports that the song was once included on the Instagram of Bey’s mother, Tina Knowles, in a video post featuring Bey and Jay-Z dancing to the R&B song at a family gathering. The post was reportedly taken down in December 2017. On top of that, a different cover of the song was recorded by Destiny’s Child in 1997, though the track was never released and bootlegged versions have only become available in the years since the group broke up. In addition to being included on the album, Beyoncé’s new rendition of “Before I Let Go” also plays over the closing credits of the Homecoming documentary. The full Homecoming album divides Beyoncé’s two-hour-plus Coachella concert into 40 tracks, including older hits like “Baby Boy” and “Crazy in Love” alongside Destiny’s Child songs “Soldier” and “Say My Name,” which she performed with former bandmates Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland. Though in the past some Beyoncé releases have at first become exclusively available on Jay-Z’s streaming service Tidal, Homecoming: The Live Album was released across major streaming platforms including Spotify and Apple Music.

The U.S. government’s lackluster response to Yahoo and Equifax data breaches.,slate.com,Josephine Wolff,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/equifax-data-breach-aftermath-canada-united-states.html,"New Details From the Mueller Report About Don Jr.’s Interactions With WikiLeaks When the Canadian Privacy Commissioner’s office released the results of its investigation into the Equifax breach last week, it only served to highlight how little the U.S. government has done to address the 2017 incident, which affected the data of 146 million people. So far, the United States’ attempts to rectify the weak security at Equifax or compensate victims of the breach have been relatively local and lackluster. Eight state banking regulatory authorities issued a consent order that required Equifax to conduct more risk assessment and internal audit programs for consumers’ personal data. The Government Accountability Office released two reports, one on the response to the Equifax breach and another on the need for better oversight of consumer reporting agencies . But at the federal level, neither the Federal Trade Commission nor the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has taken any steps yet to fine Equifax or force it to ramp up its security moving forward. Equifax is apparently anticipating that both agencies may soon impose penalties , according to its SEC filings. But in February, the CFPB wound down its investigation of the breach. The U.S. government may yet take strong action against Equifax, but it’s been a year and a half since the breach. The current federal government has shown repeatedly that it cares little about this incident, in particular, and data security in general—creating a void that the courts may be stepping in to fill. In Canada, meanwhile, the government has recommended in its recent report that Equifax Canada “identify Canadians’ personal information that should no longer be retained by Equifax Inc. according to its retention schedule and delete it” and provide a third-party security assessment and audit to the Canadian government every two years for the next six years. Data minimization and third-party audits are both important steps for strengthening security, and it’s significant that the recommendations came from a regulator, especially since individuals don’t choose to directly hand over their information to credit bureaus and therefore can’t vote with their feet by deciding not to do business with Equifax anymore. Those provisions only apply to Equifax Canada and personal information held by the company about Canadians, unfortunately. But another massive breach from the recent past suggests there may be a way forward for the U.S. to take similar steps, even without the federal government’s intervention. Also last week , Yahoo reached a $117.5 million settlement in a class-action suit brought by victims of three data breaches that affected roughly 3 billion accounts between 2013 and 2016. The settlement has garnered a lot of attention for creating the “biggest common fund ever obtained in a data breach case,” according to the plaintiffs’ lawyer John Yanchunis , but the fund money allocated to the breach victims and their attorneys isn’t the most important thing here. Essentially, the settlement does the work of the Federal Trade Commission by requiring substantial changes to Verizon’s security practices and investment, all without the FTC actually having to lift a finger. (The FTC may yet take further action against Verizon for the Yahoo breaches, but so far the only government penalties in that case have been a $35 million fine issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for keeping the breaches secret from investors.) The settlement includes a section on “business practice changes” that will be implemented by Verizon, which acquired Yahoo in 2017. (Verizon decided to buy Yahoo before the full scope of the data breaches was revealed, though Verizon did end up getting a $350 million discount when more information came to light.) According to the settlement, Verizon has committed to investing $234.7 million in improving security from 2017 through 2019, as well as maintaining an annual information security budget of at least $66 million and an information security team totaling at least 200 full-time employees through 2022. According to the settlement, those investments are four times what Yahoo was previously spending on security The Yahoo settlement makes clear just how much by way of security investments and improvements it is possible to extract from a company in court. The settlement also details that the company has aligned its security program with the widely used National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST is the agency that sets technical standards for government cybersecurity that are often implemented in private industry as well). Beyond using the NIST framework, Verizon also agreed to third-party security assessments for four years beginning in 2019. It even includes references to the new intrusion and anomaly detection tools and penetration testing implemented since the breaches. The Yahoo settlement should be a clear warning for Equifax, which still faces major class-action lawsuits in the U.S. It’s a sign that even in the absence of serious regulatory intervention, there may still be ways for it to be held accountable for its actions and—much more importantly—be forced to strengthen its data security efforts moving forward. A class-action settlement can’t necessarily do all the things that a regulator can. For instance, the recent report from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada recommends that Equifax Canada report on its security to the Canadian government every two years—an analogous requirement in the U.S. would probably require the insistence of a government agency. Similarly, it’s not clear that a court could order Equifax to go through the data held on U.S. people and delete any unnecessary information. I’m still hopeful that the FTC may choose to take meaningful regulatory action against Verizon for the Yahoo breaches, but the Yahoo settlement makes clear just how much by way of security investments and improvements it is possible to extract from a company in court. The $117.5 million figure may scare Equifax—it’s a large sum by data breach settlement standards and Equifax’s revenue in 2018 was $3.4 billion , so a comparable settlement would total roughly 3.5 percent of the company’s annual revenue (close to the max fine of 4 percent annual revenues allowable under Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation). But that figure pales in comparison to the investment that Verizon has agreed to make in security moving forward: It will put nearly twice as much money toward security as it will toward that settlement just by the end of 2019. And it’s committed to spend nearly another $200 million on security in the three years after that. Those are the changes that have the potential to make a real difference for consumers’ security moving forward and they will be vastly more expensive and more meaningful than the settlement fund. They’re also the type of changes that, in the U.S., we have long relied on the FTC to drive, but that may be increasingly less necessary."
Alan Dershowitz Sued for Defamation By Alleged Jeffrey Epstein Sexual Abuse Victim,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/alan-dershowitz-defamation-lawsuit-jeffrey-epstein-abuse-case.html,"Don’t Rebuild Notre Dame The prominent lawyer and Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz is being sued for defamation in connection with the sexual assault allegations against well-connected multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein, whose extraordinarily lenient plea deal for allegedly operating a sex trafficking ring of teenage girls made news in the fall, the Miami Herald reported Tuesday. The suit, filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York by one of Epstein’s alleged victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, charges that Dershowitz, as one of Epstein’s lawyers, was aware of and participated in Epstein’s sexual abuse of teenage girls but still spread false information about Giuffre and other victims in order to silence them. The suit focuses on Dershowitz’s assertions that the alleged victims fabricated their accusations. In the suit, Giuffre claims that she was coerced into having sex with Dershowitz and other wealthy and powerful men when she was a teenager. Dershowitz has maintained his innocence and asserted that he has proof that Giuffre’s allegations are false. He has claimed he never met Giuffre, and he has said he will at some point give the Herald exculpatory evidence from some of his documents. In a filing for that lawsuit, another woman also came forward to add her story to the growing list of sexual assault allegations against Epstein, the Herald reported. Maria Farmer, now 49, says Epstein and his companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, sexually assaulted her in 1996, when she was a 26-year-old art student. She also alleges that Epstein molested her then–15-year-old sister repeatedly. Farmer claims she reported her assault to the FBI and New York police—which would make her the first person to report them to the FBI—but that the FBI took no action against Epstein. Farmer, in the filing, added that she frequently saw underage girls come into his New York mansion and head upstairs. She was told they were auditioning for modeling work, according to the affidavit. She also alleges in the filing that she saw Dershowitz head upstairs while there were underage girls present. Dershowitz has publicly criticized the Herald, which first published a series about Epstein and the role of Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, then the U.S. attorney in Miami, in brokering a plea deal for Epstein that gave him federal immunity, kept his victims in the dark, and protected any other potentially guilty parties. It was in the paper’s investigation, which identified 80 potential victims of Epstein’s abuse, that Giuffre’s accusations against Dershowitz were first published. Since then, another woman, Sarah Ransome, has said when she was 22 she was “lent out” by Epstein to have sex with Dershowitz . “No sensible person looks forward to litigation,’’ Giuffre said in a statement. “And I know that standing up for myself and others will cause Mr. Dershowitz and Mr. Epstein to redouble their efforts to destroy me and my reputation. But I can no longer sit by and not respond. As my complaint shows, my abusers have sought to conceal their guilt behind a curtain of lies. My complaint calls for the accounting to which I, and their other victims, are entitled.”"
Mueller report: Will not be read in full before I start writing.,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-cautious-reporting-no-thanks.html,"Don’t Rebuild Notre Dame From media critics to national security reporters to public radio and beyond , a consensus has emerged: News organizations will be committing a disastrous betrayal of the public trust if they are anything less than extraordinarily cautious, deliberate, nuanced, and judicious in their coverage of the partially redacted version of Robert Mueller’s special counsel report, set to be released by the Department of Justice Thursday. The Washington Post’s Margaret Sullivan writes, for example, that the media needs to “resist the temptation” to let pundits “who haven’t read the report become instant, would-be experts on it” and approvingly quotes a scholar who says that the press needs to “put the opinionators to the side for a good long while” after the release; ProPublica’s Eric Umansky promises that his colleagues at the Trump, Inc. podcast will be reading the report in full without access to their phones (!) before emitting any “takes.” These warnings are being made by smart , thoughtful journalists, and they are a well-intentioned response to what may have been premature mediawide credulousness regarding Attorney General William Barr’s tightly hedged summary of Mueller’s findings. Here at Slate, though, we’re making our readers a promise nonetheless: If you want to find out what’s in the Mueller report after it’s released and before the Washington Post and ProPublica have finished their six-hour Talmudic considerations of its motifs and footnotes, you can tune in to our live blog, where we (I) will be posting about its wildest, most sensational, collusion-adjacent, and/or exoneration-tastic sections the very second that we read them and no later. Why the indiscretion? First, Slate is a for-profit business, and we need to be ruthless about exploiting clicks and eyeballs for advertising dollars so we can pay for our lattes, Volvos, and arugula. But also, the release of the Mueller report is going to be a newsworthy and fluid event that, like all such events, can in fact be covered and interpreted both accurately and in real time so long as it’s done with the right amount of transparency and self-awareness about uncertainty. The only pundits you really shouldn’t pay attention to Thursday are those who immediately declare that they know definitively what the report means. (Sullivan sort of acknowledges this, but only while asserting that the media broadly is probably going to do a bad job and that even appropriately hedged real-time report reading isn’t “great journalism.”) The assumption that readers don’t understand that Mueller’s top-line conclusions might take some time to unpack, and that certain elements of the special counsel’s work will ultimately be viewed differently by different political factions, seems like it sells readers a little short. (It’s a cousin of the liberal-Twitter insistence that media outlets need to add “AND HE MIGHT BE LYING, WHICH IS BAD” every time they quote Donald Trump .) The reality is that in the United States on Thursday everyone is going to be extremely interested, for good reason, in finding out about what seem like the most interesting bits and pieces of the Mueller report even before any individual person has finished reading all 400 pages of it. Here at Slate, we aren’t going to pretend otherwise, and we will absolutely let you know what our Ctrl-F search for “pee tape” brings up as soon as we make it."
What Happened to Winter on Game of Thrones ?,slate.com,Inkoo Kang,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-winter-what-happened-grrm.html,"What’s Fact and What’s Fiction in Fosse/Verdon Episode 2 Winter finally struck Westeros at the end of Game of Thrones ’ sixth season, as Jon Snow returned home to recruit soldiers in the fight against the white walkers, Arya Stark fed Walder Frey his children in meat-pie form, and Cersei Lannister ascended the throne after massacring a sizable fraction of King’s Landing, including her daughter-in-law Margaery Tyrell, which led to the suicide of the blond matriarch’s last living child, Tommen Baratheon. Winter came in many forms in the Season 6 finale: the Night King and his zombie army; the mighty, and long, memory of the Starks (here, revenge is a dish served hot); and as a spreading general misfortune. But in its literal form, the winter that Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon worried about in the first season—the harsh, extra-long cold season that would follow, per the rules of Westeros’ climate, the near-decade of summer they’d just enjoyed—has been all but forgotten by the TV adaptation. It’s a decision that, while perhaps necessary, tops the list of the show’s payoff-less setups and plays into one of the series’ most frustrating aspects. The variable seasons in George R.R. Martin’s books, which can last anywhere from a few months to a few decades, are one of the series’ most novel sources of conflict as well as one of the most concrete ways—other than the dragons, of course—that Westeros differs from our own universe. The long winters were noteworthy enough that numerous critics mentioned them in their initial reviews of the show , and many commentators since have attempted science-based explanations for how such irregular seasons might work, astronomically or ecologically . Martin, for his part, has pooh-poohed such efforts, stating that the reason is magical in origin and that it will eventually be revealed. ( Sure, George. ) But this fascinating feat of imagination now feels like a mere factoid, as insubstantial as the life of Rickon Stark. In the Song of Ice and Fire books, lengthy winters are feared in part for their association with supernatural threats. According to Westerosi legend, the white walkers first appeared 8,000 years before the events of Game of Thrones ,during the Long Night—an icy season so severe it shut out daylight and stretched on for a generation. That’s cool. But unpredictable weather is more interesting as a factor for what it can illustrate about the characters we’re already invested in, and how it might affect the melee for the crown.

Westeros’ changeable climate is a particularly intriguing lens through which to view the strengths and weaknesses of the nobles and pretenders. But years-long winters suggest a theme that Game of Thrones , a series rather obsessed with power-through-violence and too indifferent toward governance, tackles with a lot less finesse than its source material: the responsibility of leaders to their peoples. (Winter could hit the powerful and wealthy hard, but it always hits the common folk harder.) As the lord of a region affected much more harshly by winter, the books’ Ned Stark was preoccupied with preparing for the inevitable cold and famine, especially compared to the ne’er-do-well King Robert Baratheon and his mutually unhappy relations, the Southern-dwelling Lannisters, whose more Mediterranean homeland necessitated less preparation and therefore less concern for their citizenry’s needs. Daenerys’ continent-spanning abolitionist movement is the closest we come to any of the surviving contenders caring about how a ruler should rule, but, as the Season 8 premiere demonstrated, her colonial ambitions and rule-by-fire tactics have her poised perfectly for a fall. In the aftermath of the War of the Five Kings, with the Iron Throne heavily in debt and a grain store probably nowhere where it should be, Cersei’s defeat should be a foregone conclusion. No screen adaptation could rival Martin’s books in their detail and complexity, but as the final season contracts to focus on the boldface winners and losers, it seems increasingly less likely that we’ll get a firm sense of how the next (or current) occupier of the Iron Throne will influence the lives of the masses, who must see even the most necessary wars as calamities they have little to no control over. A stronger grasp of how much each house has stored, and how various lords consider their people’s immediate needs (in the wars against the white walkers, or fellow Westerosi) versus future uncertainties would provide a much-needed grounded-ness to battles that take increasingly in the sky, while developing themes introduced in the first season. (Thus far, Sansa Stark is the only one to raise the issue of what exactly the largest army the world has ever known is supposed to eat.) Instead, we’re left to debate which among the brittle claims to the throne are most legitimate, and witness how military chieftains gather and distribute force. From its title onward, Game of Thrones has made plain its near-exclusive interest in the governors, rather than the governed. But it seems well on its way to miss an opportunity to make us fully understand what a truly great leader, or a terrifying tyrant, would mean for the unseen people who make up most of Westeros."
Even if Democratic Leaders Wanted to “Stop Bernie” … Could They?,slate.com,Jim Newell,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/stop-bernie-sanders-democratic-establishment-campaign-2020.html,"Thanks to Mueller, Democratic Leadership Has a Clear Path to the One Thing It Doesn’t Want Bernie Sanders’ strong early position for the Democratic nomination is giving powerful Democratic players who dislike him all sorts of feelings, none of them good. Sanders’ fundraising prowess and base of support have surfaced what the New York Times this week referred to as the “What to Do About Bernie” question. But the Democrats who don’t want to see him win the pennant—a collection of donors, operatives, and national officials who find Sanders’ politics too far left for their personal taste, and presumably the electorate’s—feel boxed in as to how they should respond. If they do nothing to stop Sanders, then they will have done nothing to stop Sanders. But if they put together some coordinated effort to stop him, then Sanders will channel those efforts into his “anti-establishment” messaging. It’s a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t moment for leading anti-Sanders figures. It’s not particularly complicated, though, why they feel so powerless: Essentially, they are. This is something to keep in mind when reading about supposed “establishment” plots to “stop Bernie”—or when Sanders himself is advantageously fundraising off of supposed “establishment” plots to sabotage his candidacy. When I was reporting my recent feature on Sanders’ second run, I asked several current and former aides whether they expected any coordinated anti-Bernie strategy from party leaders, professional Democrats, or Clinton loyalists still seething over Sanders’ 2016 campaign. The typical response was: Yeah, those people exist, but what can they do about it? “I don’t think they’re in a position to move pieces around the chessboard here,” Tad Devine, Sanders’ 2016 chief strategist, told me. (Devine is not working on the current campaign.) “If Bernie Sanders starts winning in Iowa and New Hampshire, and has a bunch of resources, and goes in and wins some of these big states and gets 300 or 400 delegates ahead by mid-March, I don’t think they’re going to stop him, you know?” What, after all, would a coordinated strategy from such a contingent even look like? David Brock, the Clinton loyalist who established a pro-Clinton super PAC in 2016, “has had discussions with other operatives about an anti-Sanders campaign,” according to the Times, and “believes it should commence ‘sooner rather than later.’ ” Other vague references are made to consideration of a “heavy-handed intervention” or “rallying the party’s elite donor class” against him. So are we talking … attack ads? What else? Members of the party’s elite donor class are not afforded magical powers, and David Brock is not, in fact, a wizard. What elites could do is rally their resources around a single alternative to Sanders early in the race—as in, a few months ago. This kind of collective action will be difficult now, with powerful players already split among Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke, Pete Buttigieg, and anyone else. This is the key difference between now and 2016, when the argument that the “establishment” was working collectively to stop Sanders had more teeth: The power then wasn’t centralized in a disparate set of donors and operatives; it was centralized in Hillary Clinton. As the prohibitivefront-runner entering the race, and with massive early polling leads, Clinton was able to clear the field of mainstream opposition and unite party operatives and officials behind her. Hillary Clinton was the coordinated campaign. By entering the race in such a strong position to win the nomination, she was able to capture much of the race’s oxygen before Sanders could set up a campaign office in Iowa or New Hampshire. Sanders had a limited political outreach department in 2016. Some of this was because of his personality: Sanders loathed meeting privately with local party poobahs ahead of rallies to solicit their support, thinking they should make their decision on the strength of his ideas rather than any private agreement he made with them. But it was also seen as a waste of time, since Clinton had already locked up so many of these officials. This time around, though, the Sanders campaign has built up a much more robust political department to capture the many more free agents still looking to make endorsements. And the officials are much more receptive to Sanders this go around, several sources told me, because they want to get on board with a candidacy that has a viable shot at the nomination and they appreciate his party-building efforts. Even the Democratic National Committee, Sanders’ nemesis from 2016, now has a fine working relationship with him. But just as we shouldn’t take too seriously the reports of a powerful “establishment” primed to flip a switch and thwart Sanders, so should we take Sanders’ claims of a such an effort with a grain of salt. Within hours after the Times’ “Stop Bernie” story came out , the Sanders campaign sent out an email fundraising off of it and against the “Democratic establishment.” This just a couple of days after Sanders wrote a letter to the board of the Center for American Progress to complain about a post and video that the think tank’s blog, Think Progress, had published suggesting Sanders was hypocritical for being a millionaire. While neither the blog nor the video was a sterling achievement in the annals of political journalism, they were also … just a blog and a video. If those are the resources that the “establishment” is marshaling against Sanders, then perhaps the power of that campaign has been overstated. Support our journalism

"I Made Gaybros for Gays Into Guy Stuff. But as We Grew, I Learned That “Stuff” Could Include More Than I Imagined.",slate.com,Alexander De Luca,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/gaybros-reddit-non-scene-gay-male-community.html,"Hurricane Maria Tore at the Fabric of Their Island. Now, Queer Puerto Ricans Are Busy Sewing Something New. You’ve probably heard of the idea of a queer “scene,” perhaps most often from people who don’t care for it. But what, exactly, is this scene? Who’s a part of it? Who isn’t? Who decides? Is there more than one? What happens when a scene evolves—or when it doesn’t? These are the questions we’ve gathered a group of writers to consider for an Outward special issue on “The Scene” in LGBTQ life today. You can read all of the stories in the issue here , and you can listen to a full episode of the Outward podcast covering more of the queer scene by subscribing on iTunes , Spotify , or wherever you get your audio . At the age of 21, I deleted every show tune off my iPod Video and disciplined my wavy hair into an almost-military buzzcut. Now, I decided, I was really into trucks and hockey. Previously a too-fastidious Alex, I made people call me Al. I turned my nose up at pop culture, fashion, or anything associated with the gay scene—or at least what I perceived the gay scene to be. At the time, I undertook this overhaul because that stuff, with all its flash and pretense, had come to annoy me; in today’s slang, I would have called it all incredibly “basic.” So I left that basic shit behind and went on with my life as a newly non-basic, overtly masculine gay man. Fast-forward two years. The lights were dim. I found myself descending to the lower level of a Fenway Park bar, hands cold and clammy with nerves, the music loud. I was hosting the first meet-up for Gaybros, a Reddit community I had founded months prior. I created Gaybros in early 2012 in response to what I saw as a lack of gay-friendly spaces online for men who liked “guy stuff.” Guy stuff, as our description explained, was sports, military issues, video games, camping, activities that left your hands dirty and were usually accompanied with country music. Our slogan was “gear, grub, guns, and guys,” and the banner image was a football field. It was consciously an anti-scene scene and took pride in that approach. It was also shockingly popular. Taking off the letterman jacket I had bought for the occasion, I scanned the room for anyone I thought might be present for the meetup. In the far corner I saw a group of frat-types playing pool sporting snapbacks, tank tops, and biceps the size of my head. They fit the bill, yet upon spotting them I was filled with terror. Despite naming the community Gaybros, despite deleting all my show tunes, despite disowning the gay scene and making people call me Al, when the possibility of leading a bar crawl for bros became a reality, I was suddenly sure I didn’t have the charisma or confidence. That they would know I was a fraud. Thankfully, they weren’t the bros I was looking for, so I took a breath and got myself an on-brand drink—whiskey. As I waited for the strangers to arrive, I tried to convince myself that the nerves were normal, that not being 100 percent rock-solid confident didn’t threaten the identity I had created for myself. It was, after all, my second go at it. I began work on my first version of gayness when I was 12 years old. Right after I came out to my parents, I jumped into playing the part I thought I had been assigned. Drama club, regional theater, Wicked , Abercrombie & Fitch. If I was going to be gay, I figured the campy scene was my destiny, and as far as I knew I had no choice in the matter. Might as well get good at it. But like I would feel years later, waiting at that bar to introduce myself as “Al,” I could never shake the sense I was playing a part that wasn’t quite right. It didn’t feel fake, just somehow incomplete, and therefore inauthentic. As users from Gaybros started to arrive, my nerves settled a bit, and I was surprised (and relieved) at how normal and kind they were. A graphic artist with a cartoon obsession. A socially awkward engineer. A junior salesman who could recite passages from Lord of the Rings from memory. They weren’t part of the scene, as I understood it, but they also weren’t hyper-masculine jerks. The occupied a safe and friendly middle ground I hadn’t been sure existed. I let myself breathe. After awkward introductions and a few drinks, the nerves subsided, and we all departed as fast friends. As the years progressed, I continued hosting Gaybros meetups at home in Boston and in cities across the country. Every time, I found a similarly diverse, welcoming crowd as that first night. I could never shake the sense that I was playing a part that wasn’t quite right. The community continued to grow, and the disparity between its branding and actual users became increasingly obvious, and so the messaging of the group began to shift. We dropped the “gear, grub, guns, and guys” tagline. We relaxed the rules on what could be posted. We more actively defended a “come as you are” atmosphere. Not one of these decisions was truly mine, but rather reactions to the desires of a diverse community. As Gaybros evolved and its members asserted a more fluid definition of the space, I began to realize that much like Gaybros, I didn’t need such a strict definition for my own identity. Just like the users who posted every day, I could like show tunes AND sports. I could watch Cops AND RuPaul’s Drag Race . What may seem like an incredibly simple revelation actually felt quite profound. More than anything, it felt freeing. As a young gay man, I was so invested in finding a way to feel pride in my identity that I had assumed identity must be some fixed, unchanging absolute. When one version didn’t fit the bill, I tried another, and another, ad nauseam. It wasn’t until Gaybros came along, until I got to engage with this wide array of guys online and at meetups, that I appreciated identity itself, like sexuality, is fluid. It was the positive evolution of Gaybros as a community that allowed me to accept myself as a gay man who need not be all theater or sports, not all butch or femme, not all one thing or another. And ultimately, the journey toward self-acceptance lead me to realize that perhaps my understanding of the gay community was flawed from the beginning, born of insecurities that “Al” was created to extinguish. Now that Al has settled into Alex, I understand the value in embracing a diverse set of gay perspectives, interests, and experiences, both in others and myself. These days, the “stuff” this guy is into varies widely, but all of it feels authentic. I’m finally at home—with my bros, yeah, but more importantly, in my own skin. "
"A Jock With Glasses Is Not a Geek, but Gay Culture Sure Is Trying to Make It So",slate.com,Zack Ford,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/gay-geek-jock-culture-assimilation-scene.html,"Seeking and Finding the Queer Scene You’ve probably heard of the idea of a queer “scene,” perhaps most often from people who don’t care for it. But what, exactly, is this scene? Who’s a part of it? Who isn’t? Who decides? Is there more than one? What happens when a scene evolves—or when it doesn’t? These are the questions we’ve gathered a group of writers to consider for an Outward special issue on “The Scene” in LGBTQ life today. You can read all of the stories in the issue here , and you can listen to a full episode of the Outward podcast covering more of the queer scene by subscribing on iTunes , Spotify , or wherever you get your audio . I’ve been a geek as long as I can remember, certainly as far back as fourth grade, when I’d regularly wear the Star Trek: The Next Generation T-shirt I’d picked up at a convention. This aspect of my identity has meant having a deep (if not obsessive) appreciation for aspects of culture that are nuanced, complicated, high-minded, and importantly, not caring how anyone else feels about it. For example, I refused to read Harry Potter —for years—just to spite my friends who said it was “so much better” than “boring” The Lord of the Rings , even though they had only made it halfway through The Fellowship of the Ring . Popularity could not sway me from what I personally enjoyed. So when I first came out as gay, it was easy to embrace my new identity because of the experiences I’d already had as a geek. In a sense, both involve rebuffing the expectations of society and taking pride in what made me me , regardless of what anyone else thought. But socially, there were big differences. Connecting with friends who share your geeky affinities is relatively easy, but finding community among other gay men has proved to be more of a Water Temple–level task . Comparing the gay community to a stereotypical high school’s clique culture is unoriginal, but apt. Social capital is valuable and similarly earned by being attractive, cool, and “popular.” As I figured out how being gay intersected with the rest of my life, I immediately felt that participating in “the scene”—here meaning social clubs or bars—came with certain expectations about how I should look, what I should prioritize in my life, and what I should take an interest in. It was like there was a direct contradiction between what it meant to be a proud non-conforming geek and what it would take to be a proudly conforming gay man. As the dating apps came about, however, I noticed that they universally provided an option to self-identify as a “geek,” and I wondered if it was becoming increasingly possible to have the best of both worlds. But that’s not what happened. When the Borg assimilate an individual, they retain any attributes that would add value to the Collective and replace all other parts with cybernetic adaptations. As the traditional lodestars of geekdom (like fantasy, sci-fi, and video games) have achieved more mainstream appeal with the advent of superhero blockbusters and binge-able prestige television, I’ve watched the gay community process the “geek” identity in much the same way, incorporating certain aspects into the calculus for how to achieve gay social capital while dismissing the rest. I’m now left feeling like the word “geek” just means “a jock with glasses”—and I’ve only got the glasses. There was a somewhat recent milestone that demarcated the progress of this assimilation for me. In the first week of September 2016, many of the gay blogs were tittering about a new Men.com porn film called “Fuckémon Go.” With stars Johnny Rapid as Ash and Will Braun as Brock, the film capitalized on the popularity of the Pokémon Go app with campy fanfare. What struck me, however, is that unlike the rest of the site’s musclebound superhero-themed films, this particular parody took something I personally considered purely geeky and sexualized it with stereotypically twinkish, fit bodies. My takeaway: Geeks are welcome in a mainstream gay fantasy space like Men.com so long as they’re hot enough to turn a profit. As someone who also identifies with the “bear” tribe (and not the similarly appropriated muscle- and daddy- varieties), it’s been hard not to see body image superficiality as the main gravitational force at the center of almost all gay scenes. Particularly as apps increasingly dominate our social interactions, what I have to offer in terms of personality, hobbies, or sense of humor takes a back seat to whether or not I measure up aesthetically. This has left me feeling betrayed by those who check the “geek” box on their profiles—and who maybe even list some geeky interests that catch my eye—then refuse to engage whatsoever. Are you really a geek if you’d let a person’s looks get in the way of connecting with someone who shares your niche interests? But even among people I already know, engagement doesn’t always meet my expectations. I remember one brunch a few years ago with a group of gay men who I believed shared at least some of my geeky affinities. Not knowing all of them well, I tried to engage on topics I thought would serve up some stimulating dialogue. The brunch, however, ended up being dominated by discussion about the gym, including but not limited to: workout preferences, stories about other men they’d seen at the gym, and encounters flirting with men at the gym. It was a topic I had little interest in and little to contribute to. Finding community among other gay men has proved to be more of a Water Temple-level task.” I left the brunch feeling ostracized, like the admission price to communing even with fellow gay geeks was buying into an obsession with improving my body and feeding into others’ same concerns. But whatever other people think of my body, I’m not insecure about it, I don’t enjoy exercise, and I know—from trying—that forcing myself into that world was not a positive experience. I’m a geek: I want to like the things I like and not worry about conforming to everyone else’s expectations. I’m not here to demand anyone take up my geeky passions, but I don’t feel like the same respect is reciprocated when it comes to my disinterest in fitness. That’s not to say I haven’t found occasional opportunities for my gay and geek identities to intersect. Groups like Geeks OUT create great little social meetups, and D.C.’s newest gay sports bar is equipped with some video game consoles. These inconsistently available experiences, however, still pale in comparison to what feels like the weekly takeover of the bars by the kickball teams. In high school, the jocks might have picked on us gays, but as gay adults, we’ve re-created the exact same social structure for ourselves. Another entry point to the stereotypical scene I’ve found has been watching RuPaul’s Drag Race out at bars with friends. They might not admit it, but many people have a geek-like obsession when it comes to following their favorite queens, and discussing who should win the current season is a great icebreaker. The kink and leather community has also felt far more geek-friendly, which is not surprising given the similar investment many people make in that aspect of their lives (not to mention the taboo it still faces in society). But I don’t love drag or leather nearly as much as others do, so I’m still on the hunt for my gaggle. To be sure, as a cisgender, white gay man, I know that my request for “the scene” to be more welcoming of geeks is small potatoes compared to some of the other work the queer community must undertake in terms of inclusion, particularly around race, gender, and gender identity. But with so many gay men already identifying as “geeks,” it seems like there’s an easy opportunity for the community to mature beyond the high school cafeteria and show that it’s capable of becoming a bit more heterogeneous without losing its distinct queer identity. A great place to start would be on the apps, which are increasingly serving as a substitute for the bars and community centers where the queer community traditionally communed. Don’t be afraid to let your geek flag fly in your profile! And if you see someone with some similar interests, why not throw a fellow geek a bone? For example, you could ask me about my favorite captain, Doctor, or Final Fantasy , come to a live West Wing Weekly taping with me, or help me theory-craft my next Path of Exile character build. It’s fine if we’re not a sexual match. There’s still something joyous about finding someone who’s as obsessed with a certain fantasy universe as you are. And if we start building more social bridges that way, maybe someday we’ll be the ones taking over “the scene” in our brightly colored Stonewall Board Games or Stonewall Smash Bros . T-shirts. I happen to think there’s room for all of us. Can I get a “so say we all” up in here?"

The series, a companion to Bazelon’s newly published book , focuses on the fight to transform how tougher, fast-tracked gun prosecution laws disproportionately affected young black teeangers and men in New York City.

No chance for peace: The Trump administration seems to have singlehandedly done away with any chance for peace between Israel and Palestine, but really, the process has been doomed for a while—previous presidents tried and failed to broker any agreements, leaving the untenable status quo we face today. Khaled Elgindy explains why this isn’t just Trump’s fault, but also Clinton’s, Bush’s, and Obama’s . Listen up, 2020 Dems: Pro-choice Democrats, including Bernie Sanders on Monday, keep stumbling over questions from conservatives and anti-choice activists about third-trimester abortions. Christina Cauterucci did the work for them in consulting physicians and reproductive rights experts on how to answer the somewhat-absurd question “Do you support abortion in the moments before birth?” Feel free to adopt her script, politicians . No more excuses for messing this up!"
Herman Cain is not actually withdrawing from the Fed race.,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/herman-cain-fed-race-wsj-kudlow-romney.html,"This One Question Always Trips Up Pro-Choice Politicians. Allow Me to Help. Forget what you heard. Herman Cain isn’t bowing out of the Fed race after all. In an interview published Wednesday, the former Godfather’s Pizza CEO and one-time presidential candidate told the Wall Street Journal that, contrary to some news reports, he is not planning to pull himself out of the running for a seat at the Federal Reserve, even though he appears to lack enough support to be confirmed by Congress. Donald Trump announced earlier this month that he intended to nominate Cain, a political ally with little relevant monetary policy experience, for one of the two open spots on the central bank’s seven-member Board of Governors. Economists collectively wretched at the decision. And, somewhat surprisingly, so have a number of Senate Republicans, four of whom have said they would not vote for Cain if he is officially nominated. Some have cited the sexual harassment allegations that sank Cain’s presidential bid in 2012. Others, like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, have pretty much written him off as an unqualified partisan. But whatever the reasons, Cain currently doesn’t have enough votes to make it through Congress without Democratic support, which probably isn’t forthcoming. Last week ABC News reported that Cain would withdraw himself from consideration. But on Tuesday , Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow suggested that might not happen. “At the end of the day, it will probably be up to Herman Cain if he wants to stay in that process or not,” Mr. Kudlow told reporters Tuesday. “As far as we are concerned, he is still in the process and it is proceeding.” Kudlow added that while Trump was still interested in Cain, the White House was talking to “a number of candidates” for the Fed. Now, Cain says he isn’t going anywhere. Per the WSJ:
“What Kudlow was doing was giving me an out, and I appreciate that, but I don’t want an out. I don’t want an out,” Mr. Cain said, adding that he doesn’t think the White House is getting cold feet about his potential nomination.
“You know that the president is a fighter, and Kudlow is a fighter. They might be getting a lot of blowback from some folks, I don’t know. But I don’t think they’re getting uncomfortable with it.” To be honest, I don’t know what to make of any of this. I mean, maybe Donald Trump ends up nominating a former pizza executive who’s been accused of being a serial sexual harasser to the single most powerful economic institution in the world and just dares Republicans to actually vote the guy down. Or maybe not. But hey, at least it’s more entertaining that your typical Fed nomination process, which tends to be dry as an econometrics textbook. This saga is a good time. Everyone’s having fun?
