"The free market created Uber and Lyft, and the same free market will kill them - Washington Times",amp.washingtontimes.com,Kevin Cochrane,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/apr/11/the-free-market-created-uber-and-lyft-and-the-same/,"Illustration on hired rides by Alexander Hunter/The Washington Times more > Disrupting the transportation-for-hire business By Kevin Cochrane - - Thursday, April 11, 2019
ANALYSIS/OPINION:
In the old days — say, all the way back in 2009 — the way a person got from point A to point B without using public transportation, or a personal car or bike, was by taxi. In large cities taxis were everywhere, and in small towns they were … somewhere. The industry thrived on a simple model of aggregation, and was efficient because of its silo-like nature.
Cab companies bought cars, maintained them and insured them. They also ran centralized dispatch centers to match riders with drivers. Their customers were the drivers that leased the cars, responded to calls for transportation and collected payment from the riders. Then the world changed.
Uber arrived on the scene, then Lyft showed up, and soon countless other smaller localized ride-sharing services jumped in as well. They’ve been hailed as “disrupters” and “industry changing” companies.
But are they?
Uber is really just a cab company that uses the Internet instead of telephones and radios to match drivers with passengers. Yes, there are a few other subtle differences, but they are again mostly operational. Uber drivers use their own cars, but they are probably financed with the bank so there is really little difference except who they pay each month, and, Uber will lease them a car just like a traditional taxi company. Uber also collects and processes the passenger fares, but that’s really just bookkeeping.
What began as an electronic way to connect private drivers with riders has evolved into the old-school taxi business, just with lower barriers to entry. And, in case you haven’t noticed, taxi fares and ridesharing fares are converging. With the surge-pricing model used by Uber , Lyft and the rest of the gang, there are now many situations when their fares are even higher than a traditional taxi.
And yet: What the Internet did to taxi cabs it’s about to do to ride-sharing, only this time there won’t be any silos. One word will forever alter the business — “blockchain.” Yes, that mysterious system that none of us really understands, and that somehow lets crypto currencies exist, is about to really disrupt the entire transportation-for-hire industry.
What, exactly, is blockchain? Imagine a ledger that exists everywhere in everybody’s smartphone or computer. It’s the same public notebook for everyone, and its contents are a record of everything that everyone has done — only securely locked so each person can only see or change their own entries. It’s not a central database, it’s a rolling public record existing everywhere for everyone, but with access only to the parts that affect each individual.
Now imagine a blockchain ledger whose entries are the criminal and driving records, as well as customer reviews, of anyone who wants to drive for a living. Couple that with entries of every person who has ever hired or wanted to hire someone to drive them around. People seeking rides can securely review and select drivers, who likewise can securely review and select riders. And, both parties negotiate and agree on price without it being set by a central authority. It’s peer-to-peer ridesharing — no middleman — and no Uber or Lyft needed.
The triumph of the free market will be the end of taxi and ridesharing business silos. Riders will be able to directly request a specific driver, or select a new one by reviewing the blockchain information on them. Drivers will be able to post their availability, and even their prices if they wish, and select the riders and trips that they want to take. Everyone will have access to the same information at the same time through the blockchain.
No centralized booking, no guessing who will be your driver or rider, and no middleman to take a piece of the pie from both the driver and rider. Sound too good to be true? It’s already happening. Hundreds of community-based peer-to-peer ridesharing blockchains are already running, or being developed. Apps like Chasyr, SnagRide and Arcade City are already connecting drivers and riders without any central authority as a wedge in the price.
The disrupters are about to be disrupted.
And really, they weren’t that good at running a business anyway. It seems like every day we hear of some Uber or Lyft altercation between drivers and riders. And, with Lyft ’s recent public stock offering, we know that while they pocketed more than $2 billion in revenue last year, they had an operating loss of more than $900 million. And Uber , while taking in more than $11 billion in revenue, lost almost $2 billion. Now that sounds like something the free market needs to disrupt.

Federal judge compares Donald Trump's criticism of courts to 'Klan's lawyers' - Washington Times,amp.washingtontimes.com,Alex Swoyer,04-12-2019,2019,4,http://amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/apr/12/federal-judge-compares-donald-trumps-criticism-cou/,"Special 2' In this March 28, 2019 file photo, President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich.

A federal judge delivered a speech Thursday lambasting President Trump ’s administration, saying the president has selected judicial nominees that do not represent the diversity of America.
During a speech at the University of Virginia School of Law, Judge Carlton W. Reeves, an Obama appointee, compared the president to the Ku Klux Klan and called his administration a “great assault on our judiciary.”
“When politicians attack courts as ‘dangerous,’ ‘political,’ and guilty of ‘egregious overreach,’ you can hear the Klan’s lawyers, assailing officers of the court across the South,” the judge said.
He noted 90 percent of the president’s picks for the federal bench have been white.
The judge, who hears cases in the Southern District of Mississippi, called on lawyers to defend the judiciary against the president’s attacks, as Mr. Trump has been known to criticize certain judges and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals when it rules against his agenda.
“The slander and falsehoods thrown at courts today are not those of a critic, seeking to improve the judiciary’s search for truth. They are words of an attacker, seeking to distort and twist that search toward falsehood,” Judge Reeves said.
Mr. Trump ’s infamous criticism of questioning judges’ impartiality even sparked Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. to weigh in last year.
“We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them,” Chief Justice Roberts told the Associated Press.
One such incident of the president’s unusual criticism occurred during the 2016 campaign when then candidate Donald Trump attacked Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was presiding over a lawsuit involving Trump University.
Mr. Trump said he believed Mr. Curiel was biased because he was of Mexican heritage. Judge Curiel was born in Indiana.

House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler wants to see Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s full report and the underlying evidence to evaluate whether there is proof of “very bad deeds” committed by President Trump.
“We should see and judge for ourselves and that is for Congress to judge if the president obstructed justice or not,” the New York Democrat told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.
He said it’s not up to Attorney General William Barr to decide if Mr. Trump obstructed justice.
“The fact is we also need to see the report because it may be that Mueller decided not to prosecute obstruction of justice for various reasons … but there still may be proof of very bad deeds,” he said.
The attorney general, during a hearing last week, said he would be releasing a redacted version of the report in the next week. Mr. Barr also said he believed the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign — but clarified the question is whether it was merited or not.
Mr. Nadler , though, dismissed that charge and said the FBI and Justice Department followed the FISA process and conducted proper surveillance.
“Spying is a loaded word,” Mr. Nadler said.

Former director and Monty Python member Terry Gilliam lamented the change in comedy culture in a new interview, saying he’s tired of being “blamed for everything” because he’s a white male.
In an interview published Monday by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Gillam spoke about Monty Python’s 1979 comedy film “Life of Brian” and how “it would be a fight” to get some of those jokes onscreen today.
He also addressed comments made last year by BBC comedy chief Shane Allen, who said any modern-day sketch show wouldn’t feature “six Oxbridge white blokes.”
“I wasn’t particularly angry, I just played angry,” Mr. Gilliam said of his initial reaction to Mr. Allen’s comments. “The idea is that we’re already excluded because the world has changed. I said, I’m tired of being, as a white male, blamed for everything that’s wrong in the world. So now I want you to call me Loretta. I’m a black lesbian in transition.
“That all comes from ‘Life of Brian,’ when Eric, whose name is Stan, says ‘I want you to call me Loretta. I want to be a woman,’” he added. “People now might take offense at that. And when offense becomes so easy, it takes the fun out of offending!”
Mr. Gilliam also lamented that political correctness and “egotism” had changed comedy in the U.K. and the U.S.
“I always felt the British are very good at laughing at themselves,” he said. “The Americans are better at laughing at other people. I still think it’s pretty true, but it’s changing because now we can’t laugh at anybody because it causes offense. There’s a kind of egotism out there: ‘Oh, they were making fun of me.’ Never heard of you. I’m making fun of an idea.”

Thousands of families and unaccompanied children are continuing to ... more > Arizona city overwhelmed by migrants declares state of emergency Mayor warns of migrant mobs 'roaming the streets' clashing with residents By Stephen Dinan - The Washington Times - Tuesday, April 16, 2019
Yuma, a city on the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona, declared a state of emergency Tuesday, saying it cannot handle the crush of illegal immigrants the government is being forced to release onto its streets.
Mayor Douglas Nicholls said the migrants are being released by the Border Patrol into his community faster than they can leave, and local shelters are already at capacity.
He warned of mobs of people “roaming the streets looking to satisfy basic human needs,” clashing with citizens looking to protect their own property.
“There is an imminent threat on having too many migrant releases into our community,” he said. “It’s above our capacity as a community to sustain.”
The move was designed to draw the attention of the country to what locals said was an untenable situation and to beg for solutions from the federal government, which has been at a political stalemate over what to do.
Mr. Nicholls said he is trying to get other Arizona communities to issue similar declarations, hoping a critical mass of voices will cut through the partisan gridlock.
The migrants are overwhelmingly families and unaccompanied children from Central America. They are fleeing rough conditions at home and are drawn north by lax enforcement policies that virtually guarantee they can be quickly released into communities, where most disappear into the shadows.
Of the children and families that came in 2017, more than 98% were still in the U.S. as of the beginning of this year.
The Trump administration has been searching for ways to change the incentives that draw the migrants to the U.S.
On Tuesday, Attorney General William Barr announced that migrants who take the first step toward asylum claims will no longer have an automatic right to be released on bond while their cases are proceeding. The ruling, though, won’t generally affect the children and families, who are quickly released under other court rulings and laws.
Also Tuesday, a Homeland Security Department advisory council issued an emergency report calling for the government to take new steps.
One solution was to set up regional processing centers along the border to centralize the flow of migrants, with new and better facilities to care for the children and families.
The council also pleaded with Congress to pass emergency legislation to speed up asylum cases so a decision can be issued within a month and asked for a fix to the Flores court settlement that imposes a 20-day limit on how long illegal immigrant families can be held in detention.
In the meantime, the council said, the administration should issue an emergency regulation allowing migrant families to be held.
Yuma sits on the line between Arizona and California, surrounded by rough, vacant terrain to its east and west. That means it has become the drop-off point for thousands of illegal immigrants each week streaming into the remote parts of California and Arizona, guided by smugglers who bus them north and then leave them to walk across the border and demand attention from U.S. authorities.
Border Patrol agents arrest them en masse — a group of 360 people was apprehended near Lukeville, Arizona, earlier Tuesday.
But with no ability to hold them, agents engage in what is called “catch-and-release,” processing the migrants and then letting them go at a local bus terminal.
Communities along the border have issued desperate pleas for help, but Yuma’s state of emergency is the most striking reaction.
Mr. Nichollls said the local shelter’s normal capacity is 150 people but it can stretch to accommodate 250. It began Tuesday with 200 people, and Border Patrol agents said they were going to deliver 120 more people during the day, putting the facility well beyond its limits.
The mayor said even if the city had a bigger building, the number of people swamps the capacity for volunteers and supplies — though he did issue a call for donations of coloring books, diapers, snacks and bottled water.
He said the issue is transportation in a town of about 100,000 people, where bus links aren’t extensive and there isn’t enough capacity to ship people out as fast as they are being dropped off by the Border Patrol.
President Trump has proposed siphoning the illegal immigrants from the border into sanctuary cities elsewhere, saying it’s only right those communities step up, given their policies and proclamations about welcoming migrants. That idea has ignited a firestorm in Washington, where Democrats called it unbecoming.
Yet some sanctuary cities have stepped forward to say they would embrace the migrants.
Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf over the weekend said she would be happy to do so. “Oakland welcomes all, no matter where you came from or how you got here,” she wrote in response to Mr. Trump.
Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto also accepted the challenge this week, saying his city “would welcome all.”
Mr. Trump cast his proposal as political payback, but others have said it’s a necessity, at least so far as releasing the migrants away from the border, where the communities are already overwhelmed.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday that the special counsel’s report is a clear invitation to Congress to impeach President Trump — and she’s climbing on board the effort.
The New York Democrat took to Twitter to say she considers herself a reluctant impeachment warrior, “but the report squarely puts this on our doorstep.”
“As such, I’ll be signing onto @RashidaTlaib’s impeachment resolution,” she said, referring to her fellow freshman congresswoman.
Impeachment takes only a majority vote in the House, where Democrats control matters. The articles of impeachment are then tried in the Senate, where it takes a two-thirds vote to convict and remove the president.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said she’s aware that’s a long shot, given Republicans’ majority. But she said that shouldn’t affect House Democrats’ decision to try.

(Associated Press) more > 'Horrible': Clinton loyalists exploited Obama's FBI to spread Russia conspiracy stories about Trump By Rowan Scarborough - The Washington Times - Sunday, April 14, 2019
Hillary Clinton loyalists fed the FBI ’s upper echelon an assortment of anti- Donald Trump criminal accusations during the 2016 campaign and his presidency, according to a string of interview transcripts released in recent weeks.
James A. Baker , former FBI general counsel who participated on the receiving end, testified that the situation was “horrible” and “highly unusual.”
At least 10 of Mrs. Clinton ’s supporters directly or via middlemen told the bureau tales about Russia- Trump conspiracies. It appears to be an unprecedented effort by a presidential campaign and the party in power to count on the FBI to knock out the other party’s candidate and president.
The transcripts create the picture of an FBI not always following expected norms as it activated an unofficial conveyor belt to make sure the allegations reached the counterintelligence division. It opened an investigation into the Trump campaign on July 31, 2016. In October, it began wiretapping at least one Republican while dispatching possibly multiple undercover sources to spy.
In the end, the Democratic Party-financed charges fell flat. Special counsel Robert Mueller reported last month that his 22-month investigation failed to establish a Trump - Russia conspiracy to interfere in the election by computer hacking and social media trolling.
Attorney General William P. Barr testified to Congress that he personally is reviewing how the FBI began the Trump investigation. He said that Obama officials spied on the Republican’s campaign and that he is trying to determine whether it was justified.
Mr. Baker , a former top legal adviser to bureau Director James B. Comey, testified last year to a House judiciary oversight task force that he became skeptical of anti- Trump data.
“I had a jaundiced eye about everything, yes,” Mr. Baker said. “I had skepticism about all this stuff. I was concerned about all of this. This whole situation was horrible, and it was novel and we were trying to figure out what to do, and it was highly unusual.”
A transcript of his closed-door testimony was released by Rep. Doug Collins, Georgia Republican. He has posted a series of such transcripts from an investigation that ended in January when Democrats took control of the House and turned all their guns on President Trump .
In one plot line, Clinton operatives tried to sell the same conspiracy theory to different levels at the Justice Department.
Mr. Baker said Michael Sussmann, a lawyer at the firm that represented the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, met with him to pitch the infamous Alfa Bank server story. The Democrats’ theory was that the Trump Organization maintained a direct computer server hookup to Moscow’s Alfa Bank, owned by oligarchs close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Mr. Trump ’s election didn’t derail the Alfa effort. In December 2016, Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr met with Glenn R. Simpson, a co-founder of the private investigative firm Fusion GPS. It had hired Christopher Steele the previous June. The erstwhile British intelligence officer went on to produce the unverified anti- Trump dossier, financed by Democrats.
Some cybersleuths traced the server to a marketing firm, but Mr. Simpson told Mr. Ohr, “There was communication and it wasn’t spam.”
The Sussmann and Simpson meetings showed the unusual access Clinton operatives enjoyed. They were selling the Alfa charge to the FBI ’s top lawyer and to the Justice Department’s No. 4 official.
‘It is not normal’
A scorecard of some of the contacts.
• Mr. Baker talked with Mr. Sussmann on several occasions and shipped his material — a quarter-inch-thick document and a computer thumb drive — to the counterintelligence wing, then led by Bill Priestap and Peter Strzok. Mr. Strzok is noted for his dislike of Mr. Trump and pledged to “stop” him.
Mr. Baker also said he received dossier material from Mother Jones reporter David Corn, whom he had known for years. Mr. Baker ’s attorney said his client is under criminal suspicion in a press leak investigation.
• Mr. Ohr communicated repeatedly with Mr. Steele and Mr. Simpson to hear their Russian collusion charges. He conveyed them to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe; his counsel, Lisa Page; and Mr. Strzok. Mr. Ohr’s wife worked for Mr. Simpson at Fusion.
At one point, Mr. Ohr handed the FBI two thumb drives containing his wife’s anti- Trump suspicions on business ties with Russia and dossier data. Mr. Ohr had his own FBI handler, Joe Pientka, who recorded at least a dozen interviews with Mr. Ohr after the election into 2017, based on Mr. Steele’s continuous flow of anti- Trump charges.
• Mr. Steele provided his unproven theories to the FBI through Mr. Ohr and received material from a State Department official. After the election, Mr. Steele went a new route: recruiting a Republican, Sen. John McCain, to spread his dossier.
In December, McCain handed the dossier to Mr. Comey, whose team already possessed most of its memos. David Kramer, a McCain associate, proceeded to spread dossier charges among at least eight news outlets, including CNN and BuzzFeed, which published it.
• Jonathan M. Winer, an Obama State Department official, worked with Clinton loyalists Sidney Blumenthal and Cody Shearer, who wrote their own anti- Trump dossier. Pre-election, Mr. Winer provided their paper to Mr. Steele, who was working with the FBI .
Mr. Baker conceded that highly unusual methods were playing out in 2016 and 2017. For example, Mr. Ohr was not involved in the Russia investigation officially, yet he was the messenger for information from Fusion GPS operatives to the FBI .
Rep. Mark Meadows, North Carolina Republican, asked: “So you are using DOJ officials without the knowledge of the hierarchy at DOJ? That seems strange. Why would you do that? Is that the normal way that you would conduct an investigation?”
Mr. Baker : “No, it is not normal.”
Mr. Meadows also asked whether Mr. Baker knew the FBI had violated its protocol. The bureau fired Mr. Steele for breaking the rules of a confidential source by leaking to Mr. Corn at Mother Jones. Yet the FBI still sought his information for more than a year.
“It wouldn’t surprise me,” Mr. Baker answered.
Evidence for wiretaps
Mr. Baker also spoke of a working relationship with The New York Times. Mr. Sussmann had provided The Times with the Alfa Bank cyberdetective work. Mr. Baker said the counterintelligence division wanted the newspaper to put a hold on a story.
“So they give it to The New York Times, they give it to you, and does your bias alarm go off anywhere?” Mr. Meadows asked.
Mr. Baker : “I was concerned about the nature of this material from the first instance.”
In his House testimony, Mr. Ohr said he warned the FBI that the Fusion GPS data flow came from Clinton loyalists.
“So when I provided it to the FBI , I tried to be clear that this is source information,” Mr. Ohr testified. “I don’t know how reliable it is. You’re going to have to check it out and be aware. These guys were hired by somebody relating to — who’s related to the Clinton campaign, and be aware — you know, they were somehow working associated with the Clinton campaign.”
The FBI used the Steele dossier as the major piece of evidence to persuade judges to approve a year’s worth of wiretaps on Trump associate Carter Page. Mr. Page was never charged by the special counsel and said the Steele document was full of lies.
Another House witness last year was George Papadopoulos, the Trump campaign volunteer who unwittingly sparked the July 31 investigation.
His complex story is full of mysterious characters, intrigue and speculation. As a Trump volunteer stationed at a think tank in London, he met Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud. In an encounter on April 26, 2016, Mr. Mifsud told him he heard that Moscow owned thousands of Hillary Clinton emails.
This conversation eventually found its way to the FBI ’s Mr. Strzok, who kicked off the investigation.
Mr. Mifsud has visited Moscow frequently but appears to be an unlikely Russian agent. He taught Western intelligence operatives at a college in Rome, socialized with British foreign affairs people and was a welcomed guest in Washington in 2014.
Papadopoulos suspects Mr. Mifsud was a Western intelligence asset, as was Stefan Halper, a U.S. academic who befriended Trump associates while working as an FBI informant.
Papadopoulos was never accused of acting on the email tip. He pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about whether he was a Trump campaign official when he met Mr. Mifsud.
After hearing Papadopoulos’ story, Rep. John Ratcliffe, Texas Republican, wondered aloud: “Based on what you’ve told us, I’m trying to figure out why one of what has become the highest-profile investigations in U.S. history alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government centered around you, a 28-year-old campaign adviser on the job for about a month who, to this day, has never been to Russia , and, to this day, has never knowingly met a member of the Russian government.”

Federal prosecutors charged a Massachusetts state judge Thursday with obstruction of justice and perjury, accusing her of helping an illegal immigrant escape deportation authorities last year by letting the man sneak out of her courtroom.
An officer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had been waiting to arrest the migrant, but Judge Shelley M. Richmond Joseph made the officer leave her courtroom, promising that if the migrant was released from custody it would be through the building lobby.
Instead, the judge released the migrant and had a courtroom deputy take the man out by a back door, releasing him into the community to avoid ICE, according to a 19-page indictment lodged in federal district court in Massachusetts.
“This case is about the rule of law,” said U.S. Attorney Andrew E. Lelling, who said Judge Joseph intentionally interfered with the enforcement of a federal law. “We cannot pick and choose the federal laws we follow, or use our personal views to justify violating the law. Everyone in the justice system — not just judges, but law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and defense counsel — should be held to a higher standard.”
The indictment doesn’t name the migrant whom ICE was targeting, but does say he had been deported before, in 2003 and 2007.
A transcript of the court proceedings shows Judge Joseph conspiring with the migrant’s defense team to thwart ICE.
“I’m not gonna allow them to come in here,” Judge Joseph said at one part of the proceedings.
The judge also took the proceedings off the record for nearly a minute and stopped an electronic recording in the middle of a discussion about ICE’s presence. Federal prosecutors said the break in recording violated state courtroom rules.
It’s not clear what transpired during the gap, but once back on the record Judge Joseph sided with the defense lawyers who disputed whether ICE had the right man as the target.
The indictment says ICE made the match through the man’s fingerprints after he was arrested by police in Newton, Massachusetts, on March 30, 2018.
At that time, ICE lodged a detainer and when the man appeared in court an officer showed up, as per usual practice, prepared to take the migrant into custody should he be released from the state’s custody.
The Newton courthouse’s policy specifically said that Homeland Security officers were allowed to be in the building to perform their duties and explicitly approved officers entering the court’s cellblock to take custody of people once they were processed by the court.
“The actions of the judge in this incident are a detriment to the rule of law and highly offensive to the law enforcement officers of ICE who swear an oath to uphold our nation’s immigration laws,” said Todd M. Lyons, the acting director of ICE’s deportation operations in Boston.
Thursday’s indictment also charges the courtroom deputy, Wesley MacGregor.
Between them, the two are accused of conspiracy to obstruct justice, aiding and abetting, obstruction of a federal proceeding and perjury.

Facebook on Thursday said the site was banning several high-profile users for violating the social network’s rules against dangerous individuals and organizations, including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and Infowars publisher Alex Jones .
Mr. Farrakhan and Mr. Jones are among a handful of users who are having their personal accounts purged by the platform, the company confirmed. Others pages being removed include the official Infowars account and the profiles belonging to Paul Nehlen , a far-right politician, Infowars editor Paul Joseph Watson and right-wing agitators Milo Yiannopoulos and Laura Loomer .
“We’ve always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,” said a Facebook spokesperson. “The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.”
The decision applies to both Facebook ’s flagship social network and Instagram, its photo-sharing app, the company confirmed.
Facebook ’s community standards consider dangerous individuals and organizations as those associated with terrorist activity, organized hate, mass murder, human trafficking and organized violent or criminal activity. They are prohibited from the platform along with “content that expresses support or praise for groups, leaders or individuals involved in these activities.”
The social network describes a “hate organization” as a group of three or more people acting “under a name, sign or symbol and that has an ideology, statement, or physical actions that attack individuals based on characteristics, including race, religious affiliation, nationality, ethnicity, gender, sex, sexual orientation serious disease or disability.”
Mr. Farrakhan , 85, has been frequently accused of anti-Semitism by watchdogs including the Anti-Defamation League during his decades leading the Nation of Islam, and Mr. Jones , 45, has been previously banned from other platforms for violating their rules against hate and harassment.
The Nation of Islam did not immediately return a request for comment.
Facebook last year removed pages associated with Infowars, a website run by Mr. Jones , but allowed him to maintain a personal account.
“We’re not victims here, but people need to know — this has been a dirty, hard war for a while,” Mr. Jones said, reacting to being outright banned from Facebook ’s during a live episode of The Alex Jones Show.
“They didn’t just ban me, they defamed us,” he said.
Mr. Watson , whom Mr. Jones has called a top editor for Infowars, said on Twitter that he was banned by Facebook without being given any reason and appealed for President Trump’s administration to “take the issue of social media censorship seriously.”
“They’re now just banning people for wrongthink,” Mr. Watson tweeted. “There’s no pretense of enforcing rules.”
Mr. Nehlen , Mr. Yiannopoulos and Ms. Loomer were all previously banned from Twitter for similarly violating that platform’s policies.
“Censorship doesn’t stop at the fringes,” Mr. Yiannopoulos , a former Breitbart News editor, said in an email to The Washington Times. “You’re next.”
Neither Mr. Nehlen , a Republican from Wisconsin, nor Ms. Loomer , a New York-based activist, immediately returned messages seeking comment.
Media Matters for America, a nonprofit watchdog group, called Facebook ’s decision “a step in the right direction.”
“The majority of the newly banned figures — Yiannopoulos , Loomer , Watson , Jones , and Nehlen — owed their influence to the massive reach they were allowed to cultivate through Facebook and Instagram, using their accounts to post content that dehumanized entire communities, promoted hateful conspiracy theories and radicalized audiences — all while they profited from directing people to their own websites,” said Cristina López G., deputy director for extremism at Media Matters.
“By cutting them off from this resource, Facebook will help limit the forces driving the spread of radical and often violent far-right ideology,” she said.
Facebook bans users regardless of ideology and has a thorough process for determining who to designate as dangerous, a company spokesperson told The Washington Times. Factors taken into consideration include whether they’ve called for or carried out acts of violence against people based on race, ethnicity or nationality; whether they personally identify with a hateful ideology; whether they use hate speech or slurs; and whether they’ve been disciplined previously for violating the platform’s hate speech policies, the spokesperson said.
Traditionally all Facebook users have been prohibited from endorsing anybody banned from the site for violating its policies against dangerous individuals, but the platform will not censor praise for any of the recently banned accounts unless those people have called for violence or belong to an organized hate group, the spokesperson said.
Facebook will remove any social networking pages, groups, events and accounts associated with Mr. Farrakhan , Mr. Jones , Mr. Yiannopoulos , Mr. Nehlen , Ms. Loomer , Mr. Watson and Infowars, however, and all representations of them with be effectively purged from its platforms.
Boasting billions of users between its social network, Instagram and WhatsApp messaging service, Facebook has faced scrutiny on Capitol Hill as recently as last month by lawmakers considering regulating the company.
Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said during an April 10 hearing that concerns about social networks censoring users “raises real antitrust issues.”
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat and presidential candidate, has made breaking-up Facebook ’s monopoly part of her 2020 campaign, meanwhile.

MAGA hat fight at Texas State University leads to 4 arrests - Washington Times,amp.washingtontimes.com,Jessica Chasmar,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/3/maga-hat-fight-at-texas-state-university-leads-to-/,"Special 3' The MAGA hat worn by President Trump’s supporters has triggered angry confrontations and political violence across the U.S. with alarming frequency. (Associated Press/File) more > MAGA hat fight at Texas State University leads to 4 arrests By Jessica Chasmar - The Washington Times - Friday, May 3, 2019
Four Texas State University students were arrested Wednesday following an altercation with another student who was wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat during a demonstration on campus.
Campus Reform first reported that Tyler M., a freshman, was in an area on campus where counter-protesters were demonstrating in anticipation of a protest by conservative biker group Texas Nomads SAR, which never showed.
Tyler said he was engaging in conversation with some of the counter-protesters when one of them grabbed the pro-President Trump hat off his head, threw it on the ground and kicked it. Video posted by Campus Reform showed part of the exchange as a female student is seen kicking a MAGA hat on the ground as a police officer is trying to speak to her.
“Again, none of our conservative people were ever instigating anything,” Tyler M. told Campus Reform . “I can guarantee that. No one was ever yelling or shouting over people. We were all very patient.”
Campus Police Chief Laurie Clouse released a statement Thursday confirming that the arrests were made after one student stole a hat off another student’s head and fled.
“Police officers quickly interceded and directed the student to drop the stolen property,” the statement read. “The student refused multiple directives and was then detained with the intention of being given a ticket for theft. The student was later arrested after providing a false identity to the police.”
Police said two additional students were arrested during the incident after interfering with the officers’ duties. A fourth student was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct outside the police department where the students had been escorted.
Tyler, who did not provide Campus Reform his last name due to fear of retaliation, was not one of the students arrested.
The video Tyler took of the incident showed him following officers escorting the first two women in handcuffs to the campus police station. A third demonstrator was handcuffed inside the police station after confronting the officers. The fourth arrest was not captured by Tyler’s video.
In her statement, Chief Clouse defended the officers’ actions.
“Although the investigation is ongoing, the initial review indicates that the officers involved acted appropriately with the goal of preventing further escalation,” she wrote. “When a theft occurred in plain view, they were right to act. I understand it’s difficult to watch the arrests on social media, however, the officers were there to protect all of our students. We expect our students to obey the law.”

NEW YORK — U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer is calling on the Centers for Disease Control to declare an emergency and unlock special funding to stem a potentially deadly drug-resistant fungus that’s been spreading at health care facilities.
Schumer , the Senate Democratic Leader, says declaring an emergency over the Candida Auris fungus could make his home state of New York eligible for potentially millions of dollars in public health crisis response funding.
More than half of the 613 confirmed cases in the U.S. have been in New York. Illinois has had 156 confirmed cases of the fungus. New Jersey has had 106.
The CDC has declared public health emergencies over Zika, Ebola and H1N1. Schumer says the extra funding could be used to boost testing for Candida Auris and raise public awareness.
