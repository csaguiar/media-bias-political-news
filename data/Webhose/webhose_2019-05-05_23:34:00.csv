The Rise of Myanmar‚Äôs Methamphetamine,www.brownpoliticalreview.org,Isabelle Belleza,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/2019/04/rise-myanmars-methamphetamine/,"Tweet
W hen the eyes of the world fall upon Myanmar, they see the Rohingya crisis occurring in the western part of the Southeast Asian country, but rarely do they look at another insidious situation occurring to the east. In the lawless Shan state in Eastern Myanmar, methamphetamine production flourishes, making Myanmar the top methamphetamine producer and exporter in the world. In spite of current geopolitical conflicts and drug use crises (among other concerns), Myanmar has sought ways to bolster its economy, increase foreign investments, and integrate itself into the global economy. Most recently, Myanmar has opted into numerous projects under China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). These investment ventures would improve infrastructure in the country and create new trade entry and exit points with neighboring countries. However investment in China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative projects in an effort to become more globalized runs the risk of exacerbating the methamphetamine trade by facilitating the production and distribution of the drug as well as bolstering the illegal economy.
The methamphetamine-producing Shan state in Northwest Myanmar borders China, Thailand, and Laos, providing multiple points of entry for importers of the chemicals needed to manufacture the drug and allowing easy export of methamphetamine to other countries once manufactured. Meth production in the region thrives due to the lack of state control stemming from cease-fire agreements between the Myanmar military and ethnic armed groups which allow for territorial control by different groups. This prevents government oversight in the region and provides an avenue for organized crime rings, militias, and rebel groups to engage in the illicit drug trade with little fear of government retaliation or crackdown. Once the drug is produced, it can be simply walked across the border at places with limited surveillance or entry checkpoints, concealed in vehicles crossing the border, or illegally transported at maritime ports and by commercial air.
The BRI project most relevant to the methamphetamine trade is the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC), which crosses from China‚Äôs Yunnan Province on the Myanmar-China border to Mandalay in central Myanmar. It then splits in half with one route continuing south to Yangon on the Andaman Sea and the other route continuing westward to Kyaukpu, situated on the Bay of Bengal. Within this initiative are plans for a high-speed railway and improved roads linking key cities. In theory, the BRI projects could boost Myanmar‚Äôs economy and provide the infrastructure necessary for Myanmar to become a crucial link in regional trade, but the political relationships at the border between the Shan state and China pose the threat that methamphetamine production will actually increase as a result of BRI projects. Proposed CMEC railways and infrastructure run through the Shan state, entwining the complicated politics of various separatist ethnic and militia groups with Chinese investment interests. With no state control in the region, there is no official guarantee that infrastructure projects will not be subjected to obstruction or physical damage by separatist groups. As a result, China has developed pragmatic relationships with separatist groups, allowing the shipment of chemicals used in methamphetamine production to pass from China into Myanmar without being intercepted. In exchange, separatist groups do not damage China‚Äôs infrastructure projects.
If roads and infrastructure are expanded and improved upon, transportation of both legal and illegal goods will increase, which, in conjunction with lax border security, will bring increased amounts of chemicals to methamphetamine labs.
These types of agreements have multiple implications for methamphetamine production. First, if CMEC improves transportation and infrastructure, routes of transportation between China and Myanmar will expand, requiring further negotiations or ceasefires with militia groups in order to protect Chinese construction interests and prevent any hindrance of CMEC. Authorities in the region are often corrupt , and improved relationships with China could allow an even greater amount of precursor chemicals from China into Myanmar. With the lack of Chinese border control at entry points to Myanmar, precursor chemicals can already easily cross into the Shan state. If roads and infrastructure are expanded and improved upon, transportation of both legal and illegal goods will increase, which, in conjunction with lax border security, will bring increased amounts of chemicals to methamphetamine labs. Already, the amount of manufactured methamphetamine seized by authorities has multiplied tenfold over a two-year period, indicating a steady supply of Chinese chemicals. However, the government has not reported seizures of chemicals, indicating that there are seemingly no measures to stop the illicit drug trade.
Not only do BRI projects aid the creation of methamphetamine, but they may also augment the drug‚Äôs dissemination. Currently, most of Myanmar‚Äôs methamphetamine is transported directly into Thailand and is subsequently distributed eastward, particularly impacting Malaysia, Indonesia, and Australia. However, with CMEC running through key areas of Myanmar, there now exists the risk that methamphetamine could be distributed further westward. Seizures of methamphetamine at the Myanmar-Bangladesh border are increasing, indicating a developing market and trafficking transit point in Bangladesh. Augmenting this, CMEC‚Äôs route through the Rakhine state towards Kyaukpyu would mean more methamphetamine flowing towards Bangladesh. Another BRI project is the Kyaukpu seaport , a $1.3 Billion USD project aimed at capitalizing upon its strategic location in the Bay of Bengal for expanded trade. With the CMEC running from eastern to western Myanmar, drug operations in the Shan state could access western maritime routes to ship their product to farther corners of the world.
Although Myanmar is hoping to bolster its economy, the Belt and Road Initiative may very well backfire at the hands of the methamphetamine trade. Illegal methamphetamine trade in the region generates approximately $40 Billion USD annually. The value of the trade, compared with Myanmar‚Äôs nominal GDP of $69 billion , provides little incentive for engagement in the formal economy. Additionally, other BRI project plans have already been scrapped over debt concerns, including infrastructure plans which could have provided employment for Burmese citizens. Because of this lack of employment opportunities, the drug trade yields even greater economic promise for those seeking employment. In the short term , improved infrastructure could benefit the illegal methamphetamine trade, both increasing the import of precursor chemicals from China and allowing for wider export of the drug.
The money generated in this black market trade may outweigh incentives for participation in the formal economy, which would deal a harsh blow to Myanmar. Additionally, domestic methamphetamine usage has recently escalated into a public health crisis , leading to drug addiction for children as young as age nine and pulling individuals into cycles of dependency and poverty throughout Myanmar. An increased methamphetamine supply to other parts of the country as a result of CMEC could hinder efforts to address this public health crisis, in addition to damaging worker productivity through absenteeism and addiction.
This places Myanmar in a bind, weighing its desire to grow economically through BRI investments while simultaneously dealing with a methamphetamine problem that could escalate as a result of BRI. To mitigate BRI‚Äôs side-effects, Myanmar must begin with a cooperative effort with China in the Shan state in order to stop the incoming flow of precursor chemicals. However, in order for this to be successful, Myanmar‚Äôs government must negotiate political settlements with the various groups in the Shan state. The deeply entrenched illegal economy in Myanmar thus proves challenging to uproot, and unless the government can work towards stability in the Shan state and generate economic opportunities to move individuals towards the formal economy, methamphetamine may continue to obstruct Myanmar‚Äôs economic development."
"Estonian populists, 2 other parties seal coalition deal - Breitbart",www.breitbart.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/news/estonian-populists-2-other-parties-seal-coalition-deal/,"Estonian populists, 2 other parties seal coalition deal AP 6 Apr 2019
HELSINKI (AP) ‚Äî A far-right populist party known for anti-immigration and euroskeptic views sealed a deal Saturday to be one of three coalition partners in Estonia‚Äôs next government.
The Estonian Conservative People‚Äôs Party, or EKRE, said its coalition with the centrist Center Party and the conservative Fatherland would create a majority government in the Baltic country, a member of both NATO and the European Union.
Under the three-way deal, Center leader Juri Ratas would be prime minister, a role he held from November 2016 until Estonia‚Äôs March 3 general election. Each of the coalition partners would have five ministers in the 15-member Cabinet.
Their coalition would control 57 of the 101 seats in parliament, a comfortable majority. However, Estonia‚Äôs president must formally task the three parties with forming a government to put them in power.
President Kersti Kaljulaid said Friday that she gave the assignment to the head of the center-right Reform Party, the election‚Äôs top vote-getter.
The populist EKRE party is run by a father and son, chairman Mart Helme, 69, and vice chairman Martin Helme, 42.
Both men would have a substantial say in the Cabinet. Mart Helme would be interior minister and Martin Helme would serve as finance minister.
The party has advocated abolishing the law recognizing same-sex civil unions, demanded changes to the country‚Äôs abortion law and fiercely opposed European Union quotas for taking in asylum-seekers.
The elder Helme, who was Estonia‚Äôs ambassador to Russia in 1995-1999, said the pact with the other two parties ‚Äúprotects key promises given to our party and voters.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to show a firm commitment to standing up for Estonia‚Äôs cause in the government and governing in an honest and efficient way,‚Äù he said.
EKRE‚Äôs strong nationalist rhetoric and growing popularity since it was formed in 2012 has caused concern in Estonia, particularly among the former Soviet republic‚Äôs minority population of ethnic Russians.
Andres Kasekamp, an expert on Estonia and history professor at the University of Toronto, said EKRE‚Äôs rise in politics already has led to ‚Äúthe vulgarization of public debate‚Äù and the polarization of Estonian society.
The party ‚Äúwhipped anti-immigrant and homophobic hysteria‚Äù to win votes last month‚Äôs election, Kasekamp alleged.
‚ÄúCertainly Estonia‚Äôs international image will be damaged if the country will now be placed unfairly in the same boat as the illiberal governments of Hungary and Poland,‚Äù he said.
The three parties in the proposed coalition issued a joint statement Saturday condemning ‚Äúmanifestations of ethnic hatred, anti-Semitism and rhetoric splitting the society.‚Äù
EKRE claims to defend the interests of ethnic Estonians. One of its lawmakers, Enn Polluaas, was elected parliament speaker on Thursday.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid said Friday she had tasked Reform Party leader Kaja Kallas, as the head of the party that received the most support in the election, with forming a government. Kallas would be Estonia‚Äôs first woman prime minister.
The center-right Reform Party received 28.9% of the vote. The Center Party came in second with 23.1%, followed by EKRE with 17.8%.
Only five parties exceeded the threshold needed to have representatives in Parliament. With three of the parties in a coalition, that leaves Kallas the option of forming a minority government with the Social Democratic Party.
But she has said that wasn‚Äôt on the table. Kallas said she‚Äôd make her plans known on April 15.

Some resorts operating in Mon State without a license.

Three resorts and one hot-spring station in Mon State are operating without licenses, according to Minister Dr. Min Kyi Win of Natural Resource and Environment Conservation Ministry.
The four businesses in question are a water park resort run by the Neo-More Myanmar Co., Ltd in KawKhain Village in Mudon Township, a resort run by Daw Nang Rosalin in Thiri Myaing Quarter in Mawlamyine, Water World Mawlamyine, and 21 Paradise‚Äôs Hot Spring Station near Waekali in Thanbyuzayat Township. At the Hluttaw Conference, Daw Khaing Khaing Leh, Hluttaw representative of Thaton Township Constituency (1) asked if the resorts were operating with licenses in accordance with the law.
According to Minister Dr. Min Kyi Win, all four companies had applied for licenses through the Forestry Department, but no company had officially been granted a license. Although they are still in the registration process, they have been open to the public for some time. The playground of Family World in Mottama Town has not even applied for license but is already operating.
‚ÄúWe will warn those business owners three times. If they do not proceed, the cases will be submitted to the state government. We have informed the owners twice already,‚Äù said Dr. Min Kyi Win. MP Daw Khaing Khaing Leh (left) and Minister Dr. Min Kyi Win (right)
MP Daw Khaing Khaing Leh had previously raised the same question about the Saung Naing Gyi resort, in Kadaingdut Village Tract in Kyaikhtoo Township, whether it‚Äôs registered.
‚ÄúBy the Law No. 4/2015‚Äôs Chapter (6) of Mon State‚Äôs Resorts, Zoos and Botanical gardens, the resorts have not received a license yet.

Burma genocide is official; will State Department act&quest;,thehill.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/421777-burma-genocide-is-official-will-state-department-act,"Burma genocide is official; will State Department act? By Abdul Malik Mujahid, opinion contributor ‚Äî 12/24/18 08:00 AM EST The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill View Latest Opinions >>
What has happened to the Rohingya in Burma is an open-and-shut case of genocide about which few can plead ignorance. It has become the most satellite-documented genocide in history with before, during and after images. This photographic evidence is an unmistakable, undeniable real-time record of atrocity.
Momentously, on Dec. 13, 2018, the U.S. House voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bipartisan resolution that declares the Burmese military‚Äôs atrocities against the Rohingya Muslim minority to be genocide. The House now officially has adopted the position that the ongoing policies of mass violence and displacement against the Rohingya by the Myanmar government constitute genocide, bringing the U.S. closer to emerging international consensus on the issue. ADVERTISEMENT Now, the ball is in Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard Pompeo Trump admin revokes visa of International Criminal Court prosecutor pursuing Afghan war crimes Overnight Defense: Lawmakers urge Trump not to veto Yemen resolution | Pentagon acknowledges civilian deaths in Somalia for first time | Pompeo 'confident' in third North Korea summit Pompeo 'confident' there will be third North Korean summit MORE ‚Äôs court. Will the State Department see the writing on the wall?
One could expect it would, given its own appraisal of the situation. The State Department spent $1.4 million to develop its own report , based on the most scientifically accurate survey data available. It reports that 82 percent of survivors have witnessed rampant killing of civilians by the Myanmar military; 82 percent have witnessed the destruction of Rohingya homes and villages, again mostly by the military; and over 50 percent have personally witnessed the use of rape or sexual assault as a military weapon against innocent civilians. To quote the report: ‚ÄúThe recent violence in northern Rakhine State was extreme, large-scale, widespread, and seemingly geared toward both terrorizing the population and driving out the Rohingya residents. The scope and scale of the military‚Äôs operations indicate they were well-planned and coordinated.‚Äù
This report should guide the State Department to adopt a clear policy regarding Burma. For starters, it must recognize the situation as a deliberate policy of genocide, premeditated and planned for some time.
For its part, the United Nations also has completed a fact-finding mission in Burma and produced a report documenting the heinous crimes of the Tatmadaw, the Burmese military. The mission‚Äôs report, one of the longest human rights inquiries ever produced by the organization, joins a growing body of evidence establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the Tatmadaw has indeed committed genocide against its people.
National governments no longer can deny the obvious. In September, Canada became the first country to declare that the actions of the Burmese military constitute genocidal crimes against a largely defenseless, innocent population.
With 149 signatories to the U.N. treaty on genocide ‚Äî which clearly states that cases of genocide require an international response ‚Äî the official declaration of genocide by the U.S. State Department would resonate around the world. The global community would be compelled to act on the behalf of the Rohingya under international law.
The case of the Bosnian genocide, which took 25 years to successfully prosecute , demonstrates the need to shift from a stance of punishing genocide to preventing it. In this sense, the case of the Rohingya presents an opportunity to make a clear, forceful statement that such unconscionable crimes will not be countenanced.
On a policy level, the declaration of genocide is required to bring the kind of pressure to bear on the Burmese regime that would tilt the scale in favor of the Rohingya. For example, it would open the way to comprehensive economic sanctions, excluding food and medicine. Up until late 2016, the existence of sanctions led to democratic reforms in Burma. Once lifted , their absence sent an unmistakable signal to the Burmese military that there would be few consequences for its brutal actions. Bipartisan leaders in Congress and human rights advocates across the globe agree that the decision to remove sanctions was a grave miscalculation.
In the name of humanity, the State Department should follow the House to declare genocide in Burma, resolve to support full sanctions except on food and medicine, and thus provide leverage for the restoration of Rohingya citizenship ‚Äî an essential condition that must be in place for a safe, dignified return for the refugees. Doing so will go a long way toward restoring the image of the United States as a force for moral order in the world, and will make sure that the horrors of genocide are relegated to history books, where they belong, rather than headlines.
As the House recognized, we stand at a crossroads. Down one path lies escalating genocidal violence by authoritarian, ethnonationalist states who have been emboldened by an apathetic international community. Down the other is the clear path of moral integrity, strongly stating that genocide will not be tolerated. The choice is clear.

US must encourage world action to end genocide in Burma,thehill.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/410774-us-nust-encourage-world-action-to-end-genocide-in-burma,"US must encourage world action to end genocide in Burma By Imam Malik Mujahid, opinion contributor ‚Äî 10/12/18 08:00 AM EDT The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill ¬© Getty Images
Seventy years ago, the United Nations was founded in the wake of the unprecedented horrors of World War II. Its charter was conceived as a response to the unimaginable state-organized campaigns of genocide that defined that war. The watchwords of the newly-formed international body were: ‚ÄúNever again.‚Äù
This cherished ideal is more relevant today than ever. When the U.N. General Assembly convened in September in New York, it brought together leaders from every corner of the world to assess the state of the human community. These leaders convened at a time when the world is desperately in need of leadership rooted in a renewed commitment to humanitarian justice. ADVERTISEMENT
The United Nations recently completed a fact-finding mission in Burma and produced a 400- page report documenting the full extent of shocking crimes by the Tatmadaw, the Burmese military. The mission‚Äôs exhaustively researched report, one of the longest human rights inquiries ever produced by the organization, joins a growing body of evidence establishing, beyond any doubt, that the Tatmadaw indeed has committed genocide against its own people.
However, there is a real danger that this U.N. report may amount to too little, too late.
Who will act on it? The world did not move on Darfur until President George W. Bush imposed sanctions under the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 . The world also remained a silent spectator to the bone-sticking human images of Bosnian concentration camps until the United States moved in 1995 to stop the violence and conflict.
Today the world again needs U.S. leadership against deliberate killings.
This is the time for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard Pompeo Trump admin revokes visa of International Criminal Court prosecutor pursuing Afghan war crimes Overnight Defense: Lawmakers urge Trump not to veto Yemen resolution | Pentagon acknowledges civilian deaths in Somalia for first time | Pompeo 'confident' in third North Korea summit Pompeo 'confident' there will be third North Korean summit MORE to declare genocide and place full sanctions on Burma until its government agrees to give security and citizenship to Rohingyas based on scientific research, which no other entity has done so far.
Without American leadership, sadly, not much will happen at the United Nations, despite its fact-finding mission.
A year after the massive pogrom of Rohingya Muslims from Rakhine State, which expelled 800,000 innocent people ‚Äî including tens of thousands of children ‚Äî through terroristic tactics of rape, pillage and murder, no real measure to stop this genocide and punish those responsible has occurred. The United States and European Union have put in place targeted sanctions that have not worked. It is time to do what worked before: impose full sanctions. Such action forced the military to allow a limited democracy, and now it‚Äôs time to force them to give full democracy, freedom and citizenship to all of Burma‚Äôs residents.
More distressing, the relative inaction on Rohingya genocide apparently has encouraged the Burmese military to go after Kachins, the mostly Christian people. They have lost about 400 villages and 300 churches to Burmese military attacks.
Inaction also sets a dangerous precedent for neighboring countries. In the past few months, the Chinese government has sent millions of Uyghur Muslims to concentration camps, Vice President Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard Pence Can America return to the moon by 2024? Buttigieg: Trump's actions make it hard to think he 'believes in God' Buttigieg: Idea that God wants Pence to be vice president gives God 'very little credit' MORE noted in an address to the State Department‚Äôs Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom in July. The same month, India delisted 4 million Bengali-speaking people from citizenship as extremists called for their deportation.
The United States must lead the United Nations in taking a stand against genocide. Throwing its considerable prestige behind the cause of full sanctions against Burma, exempting food and medicine, would send a clear signal that the international community is serious about ending the ethnic massacres and foreclosing such violence by any government in the future.
The time to act indeed is now.

Atanga Nji at it again: Plans to Ban CRM, a political party that can oust Boys like Bouteflika.
That villainous fellow has chosen to be in the news these days, though always for the most repugnant reasons. Just after claiming in a press conference that more than 152,000 displaced persons from the crisis plagued Southern Cameroons have received the poisonous so-called Humanitarian Assistance Aid, he has now turned to ban a protest March organized by the CRM of Cameroun political Prisoner, Maurice Kamto.
In a recently published press release, the narcotic minister of Interior for La Republique, Atanga Nji has banned a planned protest by the most vibrant political party in that country. This is all efforts to avert any possible uprising that can send packing the ailing Biya same manner like Algerian‚Äôs Bouteflika. The overzealous ‚Äòminister of Territorial Administration‚Äô has promised to see the totalitarian and dictatorial regime gain firm roots in La Republi que even as the hitman continue his massacre job in Ambazonia.
The Cameroun Renaissance Movement, CRM, is the most authoritative political party now in Cameroun that is giving the regime some headache. Its leader, Maurice Kamto is in jail for no crime committed, but for claiming victory in the farse and fraudulent October 2018 presidential election that saw biya winning overwhelmingly. Nji Atanga in his communique further describes the 6th to 13th April peaceful protest by CRM as criminal and a threat to ‚ÄúState Unity‚Äù.
Last year, this same stands Nji intervened in the affairs of other parties like CPP of Kah Wallah to sack it‚Äôs national President prior to the election of a new president. The level of interference in Press and other Parties affairs in neighboring La Republic is still a cause for concern. This Atanga Nji of doubted character has been given full rights to play Biya‚Äôs role on the field.

First city layoff notices sent,offthekuff.com,Charles Kuffner,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://offthekuff.com/wp/?p=90250,"Here we go .
The city has sent pink slips to 67 Houston Fire Department cadets, the first documented layoffs resulting from Mayor Sylvester Turner‚Äôs plan to implement Proposition B.
The trainees will remain employed through June 7, according to a copy of the layoff notices sent to cadets.
‚ÄúThe City of Houston has experienced a sizable budget shortfall due to the implementation of Prop B,‚Äù the layoff notices read, referring to the charter amendment passed by voters last November.
The measure requires the city to pay firefighters the same as police of corresponding rank and experience. Voters approved Prop B by an 18-point margin.
‚ÄúI want to assure you that the elimination of your position was a business decision and does not reflect your work performance or the value we place on your service to the City,‚Äù the layoff notices, addressed from Fire Chief Sam Pe√±a, also read.
Next week, 47 municipal employees will receive layoff notices, Turner said in a statement, while city council will vote April 17 on whether to lay off classified firefighters under the mayor‚Äôs plan to pay for Prop B-mandated raises.
[‚Ä¶]
His plan for implementing the raises prompted by Prop B, unveiled last month in talks with city council members, calls for the fire department to decrease its head count by 378 for the upcoming fiscal year, including layoffs.
Turner‚Äôs plan also calls for all city departments to cut their spending by 3 percent, which is expected to lead to the layoff of about 100 municipal workers.
In recent weeks, the mayor has said no layoffs would be needed if the raises required by Prop B could be phased in over four or five years.
See here , here , and here for some background, and here for the city‚Äôs statement. It will be interesting to see how Council handles this when it comes time to vote. Other than Dwight Boykins , it‚Äôs not clear to me who‚Äôs with the firefighters on this. This will certainly provide some clarity. As far as a phase-in period goes, if the city says ‚Äúgive us five years and we can avoid layoffs‚Äù, while the firefighters say ‚Äúno, but we can go for three years‚Äù, I confess I don‚Äôt quite understand why some kind of deal can‚Äôt be reached. Maybe that‚Äôs just me. For what it‚Äôs worth, nothing has to be set in stone till Council votes on the budget. There is still time for an agreement to be reached. How likely that is, I have no idea. But at least theoretically, it could happen. Related Posts:"
Kulkarni 2.0,offthekuff.com,Charles Kuffner,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://offthekuff.com/wp/?p=90245,"Glad to see this . Sri Kulkarni
Democrat Sri Kulkarni, an ex-foreign service officer who last year came within five points of unseating U.S. Rep. Pete Olson, announced Thursday he is challenging the Sugar Land Republican anew in Texas‚Äô 22nd Congressional District.
Making his first run for office in 2018, Kulkarni drew attention by repeatedly out fundraising Olson and forming a multilingual campaign team to take aim at the district‚Äôs highly diverse population. He ultimately lost by more than 14,000 votes, or about 4.9 percentage points.
To bridge the gap, Kulkarni said his efforts will largely revolve around registering new voters in the district, where he has identified roughly 70,000 unregistered residents who are eligible to vote. Kulkarni also intends to reach more low-propensity voters this cycle, he said, and harness lingering energy from his prior campaign by jumping in only five months after the November midterms.
‚ÄúWe have people who are pumped up to come out and knock on doors right now, and we‚Äôre a year and a half away from the election,‚Äù Kulkarni said. ‚ÄúPeople wanted change in this district, and since we‚Äôve built all that infrastructure, it would be a waste to start from scratch.‚Äù
Before he can set his sights on Olson, however, Kulkarni must first get past the Democratic primary, where he already faces two opponents. Nyanza Moore, a Fox 26 political commentator, and Joe Walz, an Army veteran, each are seeking the Democratic nomination.
Whoever emerges to face the Republican nominee will likely begin with better odds than Kulkarni did in 2018. Viewed for years as a longshot for Democrats, the district has made it onto the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee‚Äôs 2020 battleground map, an early indication that national Democrats are willing to put resources into flipping the seat.
There‚Äôs definitely room to grow in a district that wasn‚Äôt at all on the national radar last year, but got more attention as the situation in Texas became clearer. I suspect that the promise of DCCC support for CD22 is contingent on Kulkarni winning the primary, as he has proven himself to be a strong candidate, though if one of the other two beats him I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll get a chance to prove themselves as well. With all due respect, I‚Äôd prefer Kulkarni, as would a number of elected officials and other party figures who have endorsed him. I‚Äôm looking forward to reviewing the FEC reports for Congressional candidates again. Related Posts:"

Italian center-left chief challenges Steve Bannon over abbey plans POLITICO,www.politico.eu,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.eu/article/italian-center-left-chief-challenges-steve-bannon-over-abbey-plans/,"Updated 4/5/19, 5:53 PM CET
ROME ‚Äî The new head of Italy's Democratic Party wants to stop Steve Bannon's plans to create a training school for nationalists in an old abbey.
Nicola Zingaretti has written to Culture Minister Alberto Bonisoli, of the governing 5Star Movement, asking him to halt Bannon's plans to transform Trisulti Charterhouse, a former Carthusian monastery in Collepardo, a tiny village outside Rome.
According to the letter , dated April 4 and seen by POLITICO, Zingaretti wrote to Bonisoli in his capacity as governor of the Lazio region ‚Äî which includes Rome and Collepardo ‚Äî saying: ""Trisulti has been a place of peace, prayer and meditation for eight centuries [...] which I believe is not compatible with the training activities of nationalist groups who often have openly xenophobic positions.""
Last month, groups of local activists and members of the left-wing opposition marched in Collepardo to protest the plans by Bannon, Donald Trump's former strategist.
Zingaretti also offered the minister an alternative plan for the abbey, which has been leased to the Catholic foundation Dignitatis Humanae Institute, considered the ‚Äúcultural arm‚Äù of Bannon‚Äôs populist push in Italy and in Europe.
""In light of these concerns, I think it is important to let you know the Lazio Region is available to identify a new path for the Trisulti Charterhouse to ensure it has the national cultural value it deserves,"" Zingaretti wrote.
The governor said the region had already approved a large-scale project for the enhancement of key archeological and artistic sites in the area. Last year, Zingaretti's regional administration financed work on 18 sites worth ‚Ç¨400,000.
""Trisulti could fall within [the scope of] such a project,"" Zingaretti wrote."

@ Sean .
I share your thoughts, Italy‚Äôs problem is the euro, a currency too strong for its economy and too weak for the economies of several competing States.
The competition between economies so different but with the same and identical currency is like a marathon in which some runners participate with an open and bleeding wound that takes away their energy, while other competitors participate under the effect of steroids.
However, I don‚Äôt believe in a planned and orderly exit of Italy from the euro, both because a weak Italy seems to be convenient for many in the EU, and moreover because its exit would determine a further strengthening of the euro and, therefore, it would probably be followed by exit of several other Countries that would no longer be able to support such a strong currency.

I really wonder: what does Deplorables have against a strong currency? I lived 25 years with a weak currency (Italian lira) and over 30 years with a strong currency (DM , then Euro). I want it STRONG, STRONG, STRONG! Posted on 4/2/19 | 10:11 PM CEST Tony Browne
Maurizio
Is it possible for a very strong euro to be succesful in all the countries of the eurozone which have wildly differing economies, at different stages of the business cycle and of varying strengths and comprised of a variety of differing industries?
The answer is probably yes if all the countries involved agree to the transfer of money from rich to poor countries, the same tax rates, economic objectives complying to an overall single political power and all following the same rules.
Are countries prepared to integrate as much as all that implies? Are the Germans prepared to share their wealth with poorer countries?
Will safeguards be put in to protect the euro which has insuffient institutions to withstand another severe downturn and will countries accept that without their own currency one of the few economic levers they can use is high unemployment?
You are closer to all this than me. Does the will exist amongst the people to enable this scenario to come about? Posted on 4/2/19 | 10:31 PM CEST Deplor Ables
@ Maurizio Bertini
I am not against a strong currency, I am against a currency that has an ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù value compared to the economy of the Country that uses it.
The strength or weakness of a currency are ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù determined ‚Äì according to the law of supply and demand ‚Äì by the strength or weakness of the economy of the Country that uses it: consider the example you made with strong DM and weak Italian lira.
This doesn‚Äôt happen in the eurozone, given that the strength or weakness of the euro are ‚Äúunnaturally‚Äù determined by the sum (or, better, by the mathematical ‚Äúaverage‚Äù) of the economies that compose it: and this in reference to profoundly different national economies (no more DM, no more Lira: Germany and Italy with the same currency).
With the consequence that some weaker economies will be under the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù and others above, and the former will be disadvantaged (bleed) and the other advantaged (steroids) in exports to foreign markets: so the strong will become stronger and the weak will get inevitably weaker.
Is it clear now why Germany manages to accumulate a surplus trade even higher than that of China? Posted on 4/3/19 | 12:02 AM CEST Maurizio Bertini
Tony Browne raised two interesting questions: ‚ÄúAre countries prepared to integrate as much as all that implies? Are the Germans prepared to share their wealth with poorer countries?‚Äù I‚Äôll answer your second question first. We in Germany should be prepared to, but I‚Äôm afraid we aren‚Äôt. For sure, Germans will not accept sharing their supposed wealth as long as other countries keep their ‚Äúspecialties‚Äù and are not prepared to integrate as much as necessary. This means the same (real) tax rates (see ‚ÄúTax evasion‚Äù below), economic objectives complying to an overall single political power and all following the same rules and (you forgot it) all pursuing those objectives with similar efficiency levels. I wrote ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù wealth because Italians are on average richer than Germans, if we consider the value of flats and houses owned by the people living there. How can I explain my niece that she won‚Äôt get an old-age pension before she‚Äôs 67 and some German politicians have already talked of raising the retirement age to 70, while Italians with 38 years contributions can soon retire when they‚Äôre 62? The explanation would be easy, if only Italy had a sustained budget surplus. üòâ We can‚Äôt eradicate tax evasion, I know, but if Italy and Greece were as efficient against it as e.g. Germany and the UK (please correct me if I‚Äôm too optimistic about the UK), then many ears would be more willing to listen to help requests.
