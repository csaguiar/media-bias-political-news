2 Cuban doctors abducted after an ambush in Kenya,us.cnn.com,Faith Karimi,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/africa/kenya-cuban-doctors-kidnapped/index.html,"(CNN) Kidnappers seized two Cuban doctors near Kenya's border with Somalia in a brazen attack that authorities of the East African nation say is likely linked to the Al-Shabaab terror group. A police escort officer was shot and killed in the assault.
The abduction happened Friday as the doctors headed to Mandera County Referral Hospital, where they worked. They were in a government vehicle escorted by two police officers when two cars boxed them in near the border with Somalia, the Kenya police said. One officer was fatally shot and the attackers seized the doctors, put them in their car and drove across the border, police said. The government car that was carrying the doctors has been found and its driver taken for questioning. JUST WATCHED Why Al-Shabaab is a growing threat Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Why Al-Shabaab is a growing threat 01:37 ""All security agencies have been mobilized to pursue the criminals and rescue the victims. We urge members of the public to remain calm and avoid speculations as security agencies pursue the criminals,"" the National Police Service said in a statement. Kenyan authorities did not release the names of the doctors, but the Cuba health ministry identified them as Assel Herrera Correa, a specialist in general medicine, and Landy Rodríguez Hernández, a surgeon. Read More Cuba's medical collaboration with Kenya started in June and involves 101 physicians who are deployed throughout the country. They work in areas that have a critical shortage of doctors and they're also helping implement a universal health care coverage. As part of the exchange program, Kenya sent 50 doctors to Cuba to get specialized training on family health. After the attack, the US Embassy in Nairobi issued a travel advisory warning American citizens to exercise caution due to risks of crime, terrorism and kidnapping. It urged citizens to avoid areas near the Kenya-Somalia border and the coastal region. In November, an Italian worker was kidnapped in Kenya's coastal region by gunmen linked to Al-Shabaab. There has been a significant increase in airstrikes in Somalia by the United States since March 2017, when President Donald Trump authorized the military to carry out precision strikes targeting Al-Shabaab. Prior to that, the US military was authorized to carry out airstrikes only in self-defense of advisers on the ground."

Beresheet: Israeli spacecraft crashed due to technical glitch,us.cnn.com,Nicole Chavez,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/middleeast/israel-moon-spacecraft-beresheet/index.html,"(CNN) Beresheet, an unmanned Israeli spacecraft, crashed during an attempt to land on the moon due to a technical glitch, said SpaceIL, the Israeli nonprofit that launched it, citing preliminary data.
In a series of tweets Friday, the company behind the $100 million spacecraft said its engineers believe a technical glitch caused the main engine to shut down and later ""made it impossible to slow the spacecraft's descent."" Israeli spacecraft crashes in final moments before moon landing The spacecraft's first technical issue occurred at 14 kilometers (about 8.7 miles) above the moon, SpaceIL officials said. The Beresheet then lost communications with the control room in Israel during the landing sequence. ""At 150 meters when the connection with #Beresheet was lost, it was moving at 500 km/h, making a collision inevitable,"" the company tweeted. Engineers were able to restart communications with the spacecraft but officials said it was too late -- it was already moving too fast to land properly. Read More The Beresheet was the first privately funded moon mission. Its name was a reference to the first words of the Bible in Hebrew, which translates to ""In the beginning."" The spacecraft was launched into space in February and went on a seven-week journey to reach the moon. It circled the Earth multiple times before being ""slingshoted"" to the moon, traveling about 4 million miles in the process. But it crashed in the final moments before making a soft, controlled landing on the moon. The Israeli team was trying to become the fourth national space agency to make a controlled landing on the moon. Only teams from the United States, the former Soviet Union and China have done it before. If the Israeli team had been successful, it would have been the first private enterprise to make a controlled landing, with the smallest spacecraft and the smallest budget. Israel's privately funded moon mission lifts off Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, known for his Apollo 11 moonwalk, sent a message of support to the Beresheet team. ""Condolences to the Beresheet lander @TeamSpaceIL for what almost was! Communications were lost with the spacecraft just 150 meters (!!!) above the surface, and it couldn't quite stick the landing."" ""Never lose hope - your hard work, teamwork, and innovation is inspiring to all!,"" Aldrin tweeted."

Congress-Barr conflict shows it's time to bring back prosecutors with true independence,edition.cnn.com,Michael Zeldin,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/opinions/congress-barr-conflict-bring-back-prosecutors-with-independence-zeldin/index.html,"Michael Zeldin, a CNN legal analyst, has served as a federal prosecutor in the Criminal Division of the US Department of Justice and was a special counsel to then-Assistant Attorney General Robert Mueller. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
(CNN) As we wait for to release a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's confidential report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, it's worth asking: how did we arrive at this moment? Why, unlike the reports of previous independent counsels, is Mueller's unredacted report not being provided to Congress or the American people?
Michael Zeldin And, now that we are facing the inevitable fight that will ensue between Congress and the Department of Justice for full access to Mueller's report, how can we avoid a similar situation in the future? My answer: It is time to bring back the Independent Counsel statute. How we got here In 1978, as part of the post-Watergate reform package known as the Ethics in Government Act , Congress passed the Independent Counsel Act. The statute was intended to remove the inherent conflict of interest that could arise when the Justice Department was investigating the President and other top Executive Branch officials. Read More In June 1999, Congress, in response to Independent Counsel Ken Starr's detailed, and what some considered unnecessarily salacious, report to the House Judiciary Committee of his investigation into President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, allowed the law to expire. In its place, the Justice Department drafted Special Counsel regulations. These are the rules that govern Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Barr is doing exactly what he came to do: Protect Trump The regulations were intended to provide a sensible solution to the perceived problems of the Independent Counsel's obligation to file a final public report. Specifically, there was a concern that public reporting both could provide an incentive for the Independent Counsel to over-investigate matters and could potentially harm the privacy interests of individuals who were not charged with criminal wrongdoing. While this approach may have seemed sensible at the time, it has created the current predicament relating to the report's release. This is because there is nothing in the Special Counsel regulations that requires Mueller's unredacted report to be submitted to Congress or released to the American public. Attorney General Barr confirmed this when asked during Tuesday's House Appropriations Committee hearing whether he would release the entire, unredacted Mueller report to Congress. He replied that he lacked the legal authority to do so, saying, ""You will recognize that I'm operating under a regulation that was put together during the Clinton administration and does not provide for the publication of the report."" Where do we need to go? With no regulatory mechanism that authorizes the release of the full report and with a separation of powers fight brewing, the time is right to bring back the Independent Counsel statute. This law addressed many problems revealed by the current Special Counsel regulations, including: 1. The Independent Counsel law provided a mechanism to release the Independent Counsel's report. Under the Independent Counsel law , the final report was provided to the Court. The Court had the power to release the full report or any portions of the report to the public. By contrast, the Special Counsel regulations provide a very limited reporting mechanism , and leave the decision whether to release any portion of the final report within the sole discretion of the Attorney General. 2. The Independent Counsel statute created a role for Congressional oversight. Under the Independent Counsel law, Congress was granted oversight jurisdiction of the Independent Counsel. The Special Counsel regulations do not provide any Congressional oversight of the Independent Counsel investigating the President for potential criminal wrongdoing or for abuse of office considerations. 3. The law established a mechanism to transmit evidence worthy of an impeachment inquiry. Barr overstepped his authority and undermined the integrity of the Mueller investigation Under the Independent Counsel law, the Independent Counsel was required to advise the House of Representatives of any substantial and credible evidence that may constitute grounds for an impeachment. The Special Counsel regulations do not have a specific provision under which the Special Counsel transmits to the House of Representatives any evidence that might provide a sufficient basis for initiating an impeachment inquiry. 4. The statute provided a way for people named in the final report to respond. Under the Independent Counsel law , the court could permit individuals named in the final report to see portions of the report so that they could submit comments or clarify factual information. The comments could be included in an appendix to the report, at the court's discretion. This provided a way for individuals to address any concerns about harm to one's reputation in a meaningful way. The Special Counsel regulations do not provide a way for individuals mentioned in the Special Counsel's final report to respond to the Special Counsel's findings or conclusions. 5. The Independent Counsel law provided a means for subjects of the investigation who are not charged with a crime to be reimbursed for reasonable attorney's fees. Under the Independent Counsel law, uncharged subjects of the investigation could request that the court award reasonable attorney's fees. Under the Special Counsel regulations, uncharged subjects of the Special Counsel's investigation bear the financial burden of their own defense. 6. The Independent Counsel statute ensured that only the Attorney General could remove an independent counsel and only for good cause. Why America may not get the answers it seeks from Mueller Under the Independent Counsel law, only the Attorney General could fire an Independent Counsel and, then, only for cause shown. Because the law was enacted by Congress, the President could not change the law unilaterally. Under the Special Counsel regulations, only the Attorney General can remove a Special Counsel for good cause shown. But, because the Special Counsel regulations are executive branch regulations, the President can rescind or modify them unilaterally, thereby allowing him to fire the Independent Counsel at will. 7. The Independent Counsel statute allowed a fired independent counsel to obtain judicial review. Under the Independent Counsel law, an Independent Counsel who was removed from office could obtain judicial review by the court to determine if his/her removal was improper. The regulations do not provide a mechanism for a fired Special Counsel to contest his/her dismissal. 8. The statute assured that the Independent Counsel had full power and independent authority. The Independent Counsel law vested the Independent Counsel with much greater authority and discretion. Under the statute, the Independent Counsel was provided with full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions and powers Justice, the Attorney General, and any other officer or employee Justice. At the same time, the law encouraged the Independent Counsel to confer with and adhere to Justice Department practices, whenever possible. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

The Special Counsel regulations provide the Justice Department with significant oversight of the Special Counsel. Under the regulations, the Attorney General can ask the Special Counsel to provide an explanation for any investigative or prosecutorial step and, after review, the Attorney General can conclude that an action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued by the Special Counsel. The remedy While the Independent Counsel law was imperfectly applied in some cases (and the current Special Counsel regulations were a good faith attempt to address those imperfections), the Independent Counsel statute seems a whole lot better than what we have today. Using the old Independent Counsel law as a guide, Congress should remedy this problem by passing a new Independent Counsel statute."

The world's largest plane just flew for the first time,us.cnn.com,Thom Patterson,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/business/stratolaunch-worlds-largest-plane/index.html,"(CNN) After years of development in the desert north of Los Angeles, a gigantic, six-engined mega jet with the wingspan of an American football field flew Saturday morning for the first time.
""We finally did it,"" said Stratolaunch Systems CEO Jean Floyd at a news conference from the hangar at Mojave Air & Space Port. ""It was an emotional moment to watch this bird take flight."" Stratolaunch, the company founded in 2011 by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, conducted the first test flight of the world's largest plane. ""I had imagined this moment for years, but I had never imagined it without Paul standing next to me,"" Floyd said, adding that he whispered a private ""thank-you"" to Allen as the plane took flight. Allen died last October at age 65 from complications related to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Read More In simple terms, the Stratolaunch aircraft is a giant flying launch pad, designed to hurtle satellites into low Earth orbit. It aims to offer the military, private companies and even NASA itself a more economical way to get into space. The company's business model calls for getting satellites into space ""as easy as booking an airline flight."" Test pilot Evan Thomas flew the jet to speeds of about 173 mph, climbing as high as 15,000 feet before returning smoothly and safely back, after a nearly two-and-a-half-hour flight. ""For the most part, the plane flew as predicted,"" said Thomas, a former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot. ""It was overall fantastic. I honestly could not have hoped for more on a first flight, especially of an airplane of this complexity and this uniqueness."" The world's biggest plane's wingspan measures longer than a football field. The aircraft's wingspan measures 385 feet -- wider than any airplane on the planet. From tip to tail, it's 238 feet long. It weighs half a million pounds. It's so big, it has two cockpits, one in each fuselage (but only one is used to fly the plane.) ""It's the world's biggest airplane. It's so huge, it seems like it shouldn't be able to fly,"" Jack Beyer, an aerospace and launch photographer for NASASpaceFlight.com , told CNN on Thursday. He's excited to witness the beginnings of the space industry's rising trend: using jets to launch satellites. Dozens of photographers, industry bloggers and aerospace enthusiasts gathered this week to glimpse the unique twin-fuselage plane. ""People are interested in the first flight of Stratolaunch because they want to see the future,"" Beyer said. ""It's the same reason why people tune in each year to watch the Apple keynotes. People want to see what's next."" A jet, carrying a rocket, carrying a satellite Here's how Stratolaunch is supposed to work once the plane is fully tested and certified: The jet, carrying a rocket loaded with a satellite, will take off from Mojave and climb to an altitude of 35,000 feet. There, pilots will launch the rocket from the plane on a trajectory toward space. The plane then will land safety back at Mojave, while the rocket carries the satellite into an orbit ranging from about 300 miles to 1,200 miles above Earth. The rocket deploys the satellite before eventually falling back to Earth, burning up in the sky like a meteor. Although the cost of the airplane hasn't been made public, other details are known. To make it both strong and lightweight, Stratolaunch is made largely of carbon fiber material instead of aluminum. To save money on designing new engines and landing gear, the jet is powered by six Pratt & Whitney engines, which were originally designed for Boeing 747s. Its landing gear, which includes a mind-boggling 28 wheels, was also first designed for 747s.
The jet's landing gear has 28 wheels. Satellites in low Earth orbit can provide communications and broadband internet connectivity to remote areas on the ground. They can conduct valuable Earth observation and surveillance. The market for commercial satellite launch services is growing rapidly and is expected to reach $7 billion by 2024, according to Global Market Insights . Putting small satellites into space via airplanes also promises to be cheaper than traditional rocket launches because it eliminates the need for launch pads and all the pricey equipment and infrastructure surrounding a traditional rocket launch. It also can save on fuel costs, because the plane burns less fuel than a traditional rocket when it blasts off from Earth. Other benefits: Bad weather won't be as much of a problem. Storms can delay a traditional rocket launch, but a jet could simply take off and fly over bad weather -- or around it -- and then launch the satellite. Launches could take place more frequently and within a faster time frame. No more waiting in line for a slot to open up on a spacecraft blasting off from a traditional terrestrial launch pad. Competition from Richard Branson Though Stratolaunch has only flown once, it's already facing competition from billionaire Richard Branson and his Virgin Orbit company. Its LauncherOne service wants to fling rockets carrying satellites into orbit from a customized Boeing 747-400 -- which, unlike Stratolaunch, is a proven aircraft. Virgin Orbit plans to conduct its first launch at Mojave Air & Space Port sometime ""in the middle of the year."" ""We are well on our way towards providing new launch opportunities for small satellites that have waited too long for their ride to space,"" Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart said Wednesday in a statement . Virgin Orbit plans to use a customized Boeing 747-400 to compete with Stratolaunch. What's next Stratolaunch pops a wheelie during January's high-speed taxi test. Stratolaunch's first flight presents the company with a new set of hoops to jump through before it can start doing business. Pilots will have to test fly the jet many more times before it can be checked and certified by the Federal Aviation Administration. If all goes as planned, Stratolaunch said the plane is expected to launch its first satellite sometime next year."

The comments could be included in an appendix to the report, at the court's discretion. This provided a way for individuals to address any concerns about harm to one's reputation in a meaningful way.
The Special Counsel regulations do not provide a way for individuals mentioned in the Special Counsel's final report to respond to the Special Counsel's findings or conclusions.
5. The Independent Counsel law provided a means for subjects of the investigation who are not charged with a crime to be reimbursed for reasonable attorney's fees.
Under the Independent Counsel law, uncharged subjects of the investigation could request that the court award reasonable attorney's fees.
Under the Special Counsel regulations, uncharged subjects of the Special Counsel's investigation bear the financial burden of their own defense.
6. The Independent Counsel statute ensured that only the Attorney General could remove an independent counsel and only for good cause. Why America may not get the answers it seeks from Mueller
Under the Independent Counsel law, only the Attorney General could fire an Independent Counsel and, then, only for cause shown. Because the law was enacted by Congress, the President could not change the law unilaterally.
Under the Special Counsel regulations, only the Attorney General can remove a Special Counsel for good cause shown. But, because the Special Counsel regulations are executive branch regulations, the President can rescind or modify them unilaterally, thereby allowing him to fire the Independent Counsel at will.
7. The Independent Counsel statute allowed a fired independent counsel to obtain judicial review.
Under the Independent Counsel law, an Independent Counsel who was removed from office could obtain judicial review by the court to determine if his/her removal was improper.
The regulations do not provide a mechanism for a fired Special Counsel to contest his/her dismissal.
8. The statute assured that the Independent Counsel had full power and independent authority.
The Independent Counsel law vested the Independent Counsel with much greater authority and discretion. Under the statute, the Independent Counsel was provided with full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions and powers of the Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and any other officer or employee of the Department of Justice.
At the same time, the law encouraged the Independent Counsel to confer with and adhere to Justice Department practices, whenever possible.
The Special Counsel regulations provide the Justice Department with significant oversight of the Special Counsel. Under the regulations, the Attorney General can ask the Special Counsel to provide an explanation for any investigative or prosecutorial step and, after review, the Attorney General can conclude that an action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued by the Special Counsel. The remedy
While the Independent Counsel law was imperfectly applied in some cases (and the current Special Counsel regulations were a good faith attempt to address those imperfections), the Independent Counsel statute seems a whole lot better than what we have today.
Using the old Independent Counsel law as a guide, Congress should remedy this problem by passing a new Independent Counsel statute. "

'Arab Spring 2.0' is a reboot full of bugs,us.cnn.com,Nick Paton Walsh,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/middleeast/npw-arab-spring-sudan-analysis-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The acts of hope and courage shown in Algeria and Sudan over the past weeks felt ever so fleetingly like a reprise of 2011's broad social awakening across the Arab world. But ""Arab Spring 2.0,"" as it has been called, is a reboot full of bugs that many users may seek to uninstall.
As in Zimbabwe in 2017, these movements of peaceful change have achieved what decades of opposition failed to do: unseat a superannuated and wildly corrupt strongman. Robert Mugabe was 93 when he left his seat in Harare, mired in economic collapse. Algeria's President finally resigned. Will that be enough to quell protests? In Algeria, Abdelaziz Bouteflika was 82 when he resigned, having barely been seen in public since a 2013 stroke, setting an all-new low bar for a dictator's interaction with his regime. And Omar al-Bashir, forced out by the military this week at the age of 75, let living standards fall inexorably after three decades of repressing Sudan. He's also wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. None had the ability or desire to relate to the young populations rising up to demand their removal. None had militaries willing to sustain them anymore or, for the most part, use violence on protesters. But the world has evolved, perhaps slipping backwards, since 2011 -- more cynical, less ideological in its centers of power. We witness these changes less enamored with the aspirations for a better life that are keeping many in Algeria and Sudan still out, protesting, as their dictators' successors measure up for curtains in the palace. Read More The Arab Spring's momentum emerged after years of doubt in Western processes, fueled by the disastrous Iraq war. Suddenly, despite how deeply discredited the West and its democracies had found themselves, Tunisians and Egyptians wanted little other than more freedom, and would take risks to get it. The Obama administration somehow saw part of its agenda for change as reflected in this inevitable shaking of the regional carpet, and fomented it. The internet made this desire for change real, new and immediate for anyone who cared to see it. The 22-year-old activist in that iconic photo says she chanted from atop a car to declare, 'Sudan is for all' Today we are older, if not necessarily wiser. In 2011, social media was the catalyst. Yet now, as we admire the image of a Sudanese woman, Alaa Salah, in flowing white tobe and gold moon earrings, standing on a car and addressing the crowd, she is surrounded by a sea of smartphone screens capturing her bravery. That is the norm, an accepted part of life. Videos of brutality or defiance aren't so much cause for viewers to pause in horror or awe of their contents anymore, but instead tend to incite Twitter spats about their authenticity. But the most significant change in the past eight years is in the White House and Brussels. Places that once stood tall, demanding that outdated and unjust dictators heed the will of the streets, are too absorbed by their own rifts now to forcefully articulate convictions. The US State Department's Deputy Spokesman Robert Palladino has said meekly that the ""Sudanese people should determine who leads them"" and should have quicker elections than those currently planned -- hardly a strident and supportive speech from the Rose Garden. Similar noises have been made about Algeria, despite the interim president Abdelkader Bensalah -- who has pledged elections in three months -- hailing from the same ""pouvoir,"" or social elite, that enabled Bouteflika for two decades. Tear gas and further demonstrations will follow, even if the European Union has too much on its internal plate to speak up louder than the usual call for free and fair elections. Trump claims his Syria strategy hasn't changed Those eight years have given us reasons to see strongmen successors as the lesser of some evils and, you could argue, mean that Western leaders are more silent due to experience. The turmoil of Libya, unable to find peace or coherent government since 2011, has spawned a human trafficking nightmare for exploited migrants on their way to Europe, along with an ISIS affiliate. The Syrian people's hasty bid to replicate Tunisia's peaceful change led to al Qaeda and ISIS taking partial hold, hundreds of thousands dead, the use of sarin gas on babies, Russia's brute force emerging as a new totem in the Middle East, and the dark reassurance of Bashar al-Assad that his father's savage ways will win out. Egypt went full circle, veering wildly off towards Islamist leadership after the fall of Hosni Mubarak, and then after an unspeakably brutal military crackdown, back into a dictatorship likely worse than that which brought Egyptians out in Tahrir Square in 2011. But the vectors that led us to change in 2011 and 2019 are the same. People are younger, poorer, less equal and slowly hotter, hungrier and thirstier before. These are problems that exacerbate each other, and while strongmen always stand in the way of progress, rare is the successor who offers a new path forward."
A Saudi prince's arrest illustrates a pattern of arbitrary detention,us.cnn.com,"Tim Lister, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/middleeast/saudi-prince-arbitrary-detention-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Salman bin Abdulaziz bin Salman had all the privileges of a Saudi prince. Wealthy and urbane, he traveled the world, moving between properties in France and Saudi Arabia. He attended the elite Sorbonne University in Paris -- and is fluent in Arabic, English and French.
But on the night of January 4, 2018, Prince Salman's world came crashing down. Not all the facts are clear, but friends say the prince was at his home near Riyadh when he received a summons to the Qasr al Hukm palace. When he arrived at the palace, an argument quickly became a fracas. Friends of Prince Salman say Saud al Qahtani, who was then a close adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was present.

NYT: Saudi prince authorized team to silence dissenters 02:58 Al Qahtani was relieved of his position later in 2018 amid allegations that he was involved with the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. In November, prosecutors said he was under investigation and was barred from leaving the kingdom. Read More Friends of Prince Salman say he was detained and taken to the maximum security Ha'ir prison outside Riyadh. The only official comment at the time came from prosecutors who said 11 princes had been detained after they had gathered at a royal palace in Riyadh in a protest against the government suspending payment of their utility bills. ""Despite being informed that their demands were not lawful, the 11 princes refused to leave the area, disrupting public peace and order. Members of a security services stepped in to restore order and the princes were arrested,"" the prosecutors statement said. Whatever caused the dispute, human rights groups say Prince Salman's imprisonment illustrates a pattern that's emerged in Saudi Arabia over the last two years: one of arbitrary detention where charges are rarely brought and where individuals are detained if they seek redress for a friend or family member who is under arrest. Two days after Prince Salman was detained, his father, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Mohammad Al Saud, was also arrested -- after involving international lawyers in his son's case. Saudi authorities have not responded to repeated requests from CNN for information about the two men. Neither has been charged, according to associates. Prince Salman is not a senior royal, but he is married to a daughter of the late King Abdullah. For the first four months of his detention, Prince Salman was allowed no communication with friends or family. Friends say he was then allowed two telephone calls a week. After more than a year in detention, he and his father were moved to a different, guarded compound where conditions were less sparse. They were recently permitted visits from family members. The reasons for Prince Salman's arrest 15 months ago are still unclear. Those close to him say he had lobbied for the release of a cousin who had been detained as part of what Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described as an anti-corruption purge that began in November 2017.

The man in charge of Saudi Arabia 02:53 The cousin was Prince Turki bin Mohammed bin Saud al Kabeer. Prince Turki was an adviser to the King who had worked at the Foreign Ministry for more than 30 years. Sources say Prince Turki had been privately critical of the Crown Prince. He was eventually released three months after being detained. Some friends of Prince Salman believe he may also have angered the Royal Court by meeting a prominent US Democratic congressman, Adam Schiff, along with a major donor to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, Andy Khawaja, weeks before the 2016 US election. The meeting was in Beverly Hills on October 16, 2016. They say the meeting had no political agenda but may have been perceived in Riyadh as counter to Saudi Arabia's unspoken preference for Donald Trump over Clinton. Schiff's office told CNN that the congressman doesn't recall any specifics from the discussion but assumes they would have talked about Middle East policy and Saudi Arabia generally. At the beginning of this month, CNN asked Saudi authorities why the prince and his father were detained, whether they have been charged and whether they have been allowed access to family and lawyers. Despite several requests for information, CNN received no response. The European Parliament has also asked for information about the case. Pier Antonio Panzeri, who leads the subcommittee on human rights, first raised Prince Salman's detention with the Saudi ambassador in Brussels in February and this week wrote to the Crown Prince appealing for Prince Salman's release. He told CNN he has received no response to his inquiries. Widespread arrests Prince Salman and his father are among dozens of prominent Saudis -- including members of the royal family, clerics, intellectuals and human rights advocates -- who are being held without charge, according to their families and human rights groups.

His mother is the prominent women's rights activists Aziza al-Yousef, who recently was temporarily released from prison. The rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW) has also highlighted the continued detention of other more prominent members of the royal family ""outside any legal process"" as part of the anti-corruption drive that was launched in November 2017. They include Prince Turki bin Abdullah, the former governor of Riyadh. Among others still held without charge are former Economy Minister Adel al Fakeih, who had been an influential figure in Saudi Arabia's modernization plan. HRW said in February that ""Saudi authorities should immediately clarify whether those in detention face charges in connection with the anti-corruption campaign or for other recognizable criminal activity, and if not, the authorities should release them immediately."" The anti-corruption campaign was formally ended in January, when a royal court statement said that the anti-corruption committee, led by the Crown Prince, had ""concluded its tasks"" after summoning 381 people to give evidence. It said 64 cases remained unsettled. It's unclear where or under what conditions those 64 individuals are being held."

'Game of Thrones' season 8: 10 critical details to remember during the final season,rss.cnn.com,AJ Willingham,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_entertainment/~3/jHN6-LM0Fh4/index.html,"(CNN) Nothing in ""Game of Thrones"" happens by accident.
Petyr Baelish can't just tell Sweet Robin that some men die on the privy without a toilet-bound Tywin Lannister getting two arrows to the gut a few episodes later. Maggy the Frog can't just tell a young Cersei Lannister that she'll have three royal children who will die without Cersei actually having three royal children who bite the dust in increasingly tragic ways. It means that in the final few episodes, basically every detail, line of dialogue and theory from the past seven seasons could very well be at the center of some mind-blowing revelation. However, a LOT has happened, and you'd be forgiven if somewhere between the Red Wedding and Margaery Tyrell becoming green mist, the section of your brain devoted to ""Game of Thrones"" deep cuts got a little overloaded. So, settle in to your favorite knobbly tree, let your eyes roll back in your head and let's journey through time and space to revisit 10 critical details that may or may not play a part in the final season -- but will be good to remember anyway. (NOTE: This list only includes things specifically mentioned or heavily implied in the series, so things like the Valonqar prophecy are not mentioned by name. Otherwise, we'd be here all day.) Read More 1. White Walker symbols In case you needed a clue that this story wasn't JUST about games and thrones, after all, the very first scene of Season 1, Episode 1 ends with a very cryptic arrangement of dead bodies, executed by the very murder snowmen we've come to know and fear. We see the White Walkers using circular patterns pretty often, and a spiral pattern of dead bodies in Season 3, Episode 3 is echoed again in Season 6, Episode 5 when the Children of the Forest set about making the Night King. We can assume these aren't isolated incidents -- Mance Rayder even comments that the White Walkers are ""ever the artists."" And the spirals are back in Season 7, Episode 4 when Jon shows Daenerys cave paintings of the White Walkers that feature the mysterious shapes. What does it all mean? Well, obviously we don't know yet, but here's another thought to keep you awake at night: Aside from those horrible dry ice screeches, White Walkers don't talk (as far as we know). If the Night King and Company are really going to be the epic antagonists this season, it's pretty likely we're going to learn more about their motives, which means they're going to have to communicate. How? Unless the Night King clears his throat and David Attenborough comes floating out, the answer may lie in these symbols. 2. Daenerys' vision in the House of the Undying Some ""GoT"" hints and prophesies are subtle, and some haul off and smack you right in the face years before you even know what to do with them. In Season 2, Episode 10 , Daenerys enters a symbolically rich vision while trying to escape the creepy warlocks of Qarth. In it, she explores a frozen, snowy version of the Red Keep, complete with a charred, burnt-out ceiling. Hmm. She then approaches the Iron Throne -- the one thing she thinks she wants, the one thing that has driven her entire odyssey in Essos. She gets close enough to touch it and ... doesn't. H . Let's not even get into the emotional reunion she has with Khal Drogo and her son Rhaegal and focus on how likely it is that all of this very obvious imagery will come to pass. Because remember, as of now, the Red Keep is in one piece and Daenerys is torn between wanting the throne and not wanting every living person in Westeros to be turned into a skeleton puppet. Oh, and snow is definitely in the forecast for King's Landing. JUST WATCHED 'Game of Thrones' star describes 'fantastic' role Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

Then comes another, younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear."" Those are the words of Maggy the Frog, a witch young Cersei visits in Season 5, Episode 1 . Young Cersei, already very much a vicious queen-in-training, asks the woman for some predictions. And boy, does she deliver. Maggy the Frog accurately predicts baby Cersei's marriage to Robert Baratheon, his philandering ways, Cersei's three golden children and their three golden deaths. But that first tidbit hasn't yet come to pass. Sure, there was Margaery, but Cersei assured that she and almost every other Tyrell became vapor, so Daenerys is the obvious answer to the prophecy. What may be even more interesting to ponder is what, exactly, Cersei still ""holds dear."" Her children are gone, Jaime's done with her and her motivations seem less and less focused. Don't forget, though, Cersei really believes in prophecy: She notes to Jaime in Season 6 that everything Maggy said came true. No doubt she thinks about that while she's sitting on the Iron Throne in her fabulous black mourning clothes. (Another deep dive on this: Maggy the Frog also says to Cersei that her ""joy will turn to ashes in her mouth,"" which could just be a figurative and rather metal threat. However, and bear with us here, in Season 3, Episode 4 , Joffrey throws us an interesting morsel: While wooing Margaery with various dead things, Joffrey points out the skull of Aerion Targaryen, who died because he thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon. Spoiler alert: It didn't. But given Cersei's Targaryen-like penchant for wildfire, paranoia and vengeance, it's a pretty interesting detail alongside ol' Maggy's colorful words.) 4. The reason Daenerys can't have children In case you haven't heard, Daenerys can't bear children. We know this because she has told literally everyone in the ""GoT"" universe and repeated it several times to Jon, a man she knows carnally but not genealogically (yet). Her reason for believing she's a lifelong dragon mom (the fantasy equivalent of a dog mom) goes back to Season 1, Episode 10 , when the witch Mirri Maz Duur tricks her into essentially trading the life of her unborn child for the life of her ailing husband Khal Drogo. However, she finds Drogo alive but not living, ya know, and when Daenerys asks Mirri when he'll be back in fighting shape, she replies: ""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before."" Which, of course, is fancy witch speak for ""never."" But judging by how often it has been noted that Dany can never have children, it's not unreasonable to suspect ""never"" is kind of flexible in this case. So will Mirri's words come echoing back in some poetic, heretofore unknown way? Mirri also tells Dany, ""Only death can pay for life."" Since that could describe about a dozen different ""Game of Thrones"" scenarios past and present, it's worth keeping in your bank of general ""GoT"" wisdom. 5. Weirwood trees Hey, remember those? The spooky red and white trees that used to grow across Westeros and hold deep religious significance, especially for people in the north? The ones that sometimes bear carved faces and weep sap and seem to always pop up when something mythologically important happens? Some quick reminders: Weirwood trees seem to have some sort of magical connection to ancient races, specifically the Children of the Forest. Greenseers who possess warging abilities and the ability to see the past and the future, can use weirwood trees to essentially look through, like time periscopes. There is a heart tree (a special weirwood with a carved face) still at Winterfell, and under its branches, a ridiculous amount of important stuff has happened, most recently several reunions of the Stark children and the tragic, ill-fated marriage of Sansa and Ramsay Bolton. Given that there is a lot of mythological explaining to be done and Winterfell will undoubtedly be the site of lots and lots of action and revelation, those trees might come back into play. Oh, and you know where else a weirwood tree made an appearance? In Season 6, Episode 5 , when the Children of the Forest make the Night King, they tie him to -- you got it -- a weirwood tree. 6. Bran's weirwood visions Speaking of trees, perhaps one of the most enticing puzzles in the whole story is Bran's garbled, alarming weirwood vision. In Season 4, Episode 2 , Bran touches a weirwood north of the wall and immediately goes into sensory overdrive: He sees the same snowy throne room Daenerys saw in Season 2 and the shadow of dragons flying over King's Landing. But what's really interesting about this vision is the stuff he sees from the past: He sees his father, Ned, cleaning his sword underneath the heart tree in Winterfell. He sees Ned's panicked face in the dungeons of King's Landing before his execution. He also sees the creepy wight girl that was part of the opening sequence of the pilot episode. Not to mention, he gets glimpses of the Land of Always Winter, the north-iest northern part of Westeros, where the Night King and his undead men reign. Are these different snippets supposed to form some pointillistic picture of truth that we have to take 10 steps back from to truly understand? Or are they just random, intriguing elements sewn together to make people wonder? 7. Melisandre's whole deal Look, Melisandre's made some mistakes. Stannis was a non-starter, Jon just wanted to be friends and burning a little girl was probably one of the worst things to ever happen in Westeros (and that's saying something). But if ""Game of Thrones"" has taught us anything, it's that we should definitely believe witches. Here are some big things to remember about the Red Priestess: In Season 3, Episode 6 , she accurately predicts Arya's future as an assassin/freelance murderer. She also says they ""will meet again."" That honestly cannot come soon enough. She left Westeros for Volantis last season, but not before telling Varys in Season 7, Episode 3 that she'd be back: ""I have to die in this strange country, just like you."" Now, she doesn't specify when this dying will happen, but let's assume it's not of old age on a golf course in Dorne. She definitely has some sort of visionary power past the whole flame thing. In Season 5, Episode 4 , after unsuccessfully trying to seduce Jon, she pulls out his dead lover Ygritte's secret line: ""You know nothing, Jon Snow."" How did she know? There are more of her. Remember Kinvara, the Red Priestess who earned the title of only person to ever really freak Varys out? In Season 6, Episode 1 , the beautiful Red Priestess comes to Meereen to side with Daenerys and drag out Varys' tragic past. Will we see her again? Since Melisandre is so confident in Jon and Dany, will she bring her Red Priestess friends to help fulfill the age of the Lord of Light? Only the flames know. Oh right, and she's ancient! In Season 6, Episode 1 , Melisandre takes off her necklace to reveal she's actually about 6,578 years old. We really need more details here.

Behind the music of 'Game of Thrones' 01:26 8. 'There must always be a Stark in Winterfell' The Starks have the esoteric, foreboding catchphrase game down: ""Winter is coming,"" ""The North remembers,"" and in Season 1, Episode 2 , Catelyn Stark relates another critical chestnut to her son Robb: ""There must always be a Stark in Winterfell."" This line has plagued show watchers and book readers for years, and since Winterfell is going to be a deeply important setting this year, it seems as good a time as any to get some answers. Remember, Starks are tied to the First Men, one of the three ancient ethnic groups to populate Westeros. They have a special connection to the land, the Wall (a Stark was said to have constructed it), the Night's Watch (a Stark was the first Lord Commander) and supposedly to the areas north of the wall. If the northern ground is really as heavy with magic and myth as they've made it seem, this line feels more like a prophesy than a boast. Could it come into play when war descends on Winterfell? 9. Sansa and Tyrion's marriage So much traumatic stuff has happened to Sansa in the past few seasons, it's almost quaint to think that her marriage to Tyrion in Season 3, Episode 8 was as bad as it was going to get. Tyrion and Sansa were forced to marry by Tywin Lannister, and not long after their nuptials, Joffrey dies at his own wedding and Sansa is spirited away in the melee. It's obvious their paths will cross soon, since Tyrion is Dany's Hand and Sansa is Lady of Winterfell. And given that Tyrion has pretty bad romantic abandonment issues and things for Sansa are just now starting to not be a total hell, there's probably no love lost there. Also, there will probably be tensions when Sansa finds out Jon has unilaterally aligned himself with a Targaryen and that Targaryen is championed by a Lannister. So, you know, awkwardness is coming. READ MORE: What ""Game of Thrones"" can tell us about trauma 10. White Walker babies Let's end where we began: We know the White Walkers are going to be important this season. We know that most of the big mysteries in the series surround their motives and their makeup. So, it's really important to remember that the way they come into this world is completely bizarre and mythologically unclear. In Season 4, Episode 4 , one of Craster's sons (Craster is an abusive, incestuous wildling who made a pact to give up his sons to the White Walkers) is picked up by the Night King's men and taken to the mysterious, icy world of the Land of Always Winter, where he is given an extreme baby makeover and turned into an itty-bitty White Walker. This all happens with a single forehead touch from the Night King, and luckily it all looks pretty painless. But that sequence, combined with the Children of the Forest's original Night King experiment (which involved a giant dragon glass dagger), doesn't really give us a clear picture of who these dudes are, why they exist or even how they exist. We need more information to make it clear. Heck, we need more of everything."

Police unleashed a barrage of deadly gunfire after they say the suspect fired a bullet that grazed a deputy's head - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Theresa Waldrop and Shawn Nottingham,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/florida-carjacking-suspect-shot/index.html,"(CNN) A carjacking suspect in Florida was shot dead in a barrage of police gunfire Thursday after he fired a bullet that tore through a sheriff's deputy's hat and grazed his head, authorities said.
Phillip Thomas Marsh, 30, carjacked a woman's truck at gunpoint at a home Deltona, Florida, then led deputies on an extended chase, the Volusia County Sheriff's Office said in a news release . After hitting several tire-deflation devices, the truck slowed. Marsh got out and, holding a handgun, ran toward motorists stopped near him, the sheriff's office said. A deputy then drove an SUV in Marsh's direction, ""preventing him from reaching another potential carjacking victim,"" the sheriff's office said. Marsh then opened fire on deputies, grazing Sgt. Thomas Dane's hat and head, it said. Five deputies returned fire, hitting Marsh several times, the sheriff's office said. He was pronounced dead at an area hospital. Read More The suspect had been 'reported ... suicidal' The suspect had been ""reported missing and suicidal"" earlier in the week, the sheriff's office said. ""It was noted he was known to act violently toward law enforcement and has made threats of 'suicide by cop' and suicide by other means,"" the release said. ""Clearly, his actions, when he came out of that vehicle, he wanted us to shoot him, and he was going to take one of us with him,"" Sheriff Michael J. Chitwood told reporters. A seven-minute video posted at the sheriff's website shows the suspect exiting the truck, then running toward drivers stopped at the scene as he points a gun at his head. It then shows the deputy's SUV move toward Marsh, who can be seen running in the other direction, toward a wooded area, and firing his gun in the direction of the deputies, who then fire at him. Marsh fired three or four shots, Chitwood said, including the one that pierced Dane's hat and grazed his head. A ""millimeter lower, and Sgt. Dane is dead,"" said Chitwood, who described the day as his luckiest in 32 years of policing. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is conducting the official investigation into the shooting, the release states. Those who fired their weapons have been placed on administrative leave with pay, which is standard following a deputy-involved shooting."

Ariana Grande's Coachella performance shouldn't be compared to Beyoncé's - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Sandra Gonzalez,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/entertainment/ariana-grande-coachella/index.html,"(CNN) Last year on the Coachella stage, Beyoncé, the first woman of color to headline the iconic festival, gave a two-hour performance of a lifetime , complete with a marching band and a Destiny's Child reunion. It was so incredible, there's even going to be a Netflix documentary about it.
This weekend, Ariana Grande will become the youngest artist to ever headline the festival. She's also only the fourth woman to do so. Comparisons to her fellow female headliners -- and to Beyoncé in particular -- will be inevitable. But let's hope not. Look, comparisons can be fun. They're cause for friendly debate, make for clickable blog posts and are easy fodder for online polls. But doing so minimizes the unique contributions of each of these strong women. They represent a trope that has proven as unkillable as some cheesy horror movie villain: that successful women are incapable of supporting and sharing a space with other successful women. ""Beyoncé is incredible and so is Ariana Grande,"" says Enongo Lumumba-Kasongo, a Philadelphia-based rapper best known as Sammus. ""So I hope that folks will be smart enough to not buy into [comparisons]."" Read More Even in this sisterhood-forward culture, there are still corners of society that have yet to get the memo that women don't like and don't want to be pit against each other. Fanning the flames It happened to Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera because they were both pretty, belly-baring girls who went from Disney child stars to pop stars vying for ""TRL"" votes in the late '90s and early '00s. It happened to Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood because they both faced the critiques of Simon Cowell at the start of their careers. And continues to happen to others. Back in the day, Aguilera and Spears tried to stomp out the feud rumors. Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards ""It's really sad to see that some tabloid magazines still have to manufacture ill will between Britney and me,"" Aguilera said in a post on her website in 2005. ""If certain journalists want to throw their integrity out the window by spreading false information, then so be it. But I'm not falling for their lies and neither should my fans or Britney's."" Still, one tabloid blazed on its cover, ""Britney vs Christina: Why they're still trying to be the sexiest!"" This was in 2011. Times are changing. Last year, country singer Kelsea Ballerini lambasted an online poll that asked people to vote for the female artist they were most looking forward to seeing perform at an award show, saying the ""simple and seemingly harmless"" question actually does female artists a disservice. ""It makes us feel like there's only one spot available,"" she said in a lengthy Instagram post. ""This isn't 'Mean Girls,' this is country music. Where you actually CAN sit with us."" With her statement, Ballerini also hit on an idea that women everywhere are increasingly subscribing to: You don't have to cutdown one women in order to compliment another. Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood at an event in 2018 Clarkson and Underwood similarly stood their ground when a Twitter poll asked which former ""American Idol"" winner was ""most iconic."" ""I think we're both winning in life and pretty blessed,"" Clarkson said on Twitter. Underwood added: ""I do wish more publications would just celebrate women's success without pitting them against each other...Just my thoughts."" Not all feuds are inventions of the media or fueled by fans . Take, for instance, the seemingly real animosity between Cardi B and Nicki Minaj, which came to blows at a New York Fashion Week party last year . Before the women made peace , the exploitation of their conflict didn't sit well with writer El Hunt at NME , who wrote, ""when we see high-profile 'beef' unfolding between female stars, the most common cause, we're told, must be envy."" ""While their male counterparts trade blows and quips as part of a wider tradition, we're told that women bitch about one another, and get into petty scraps,"" she wrote. ""We decide they must just hate each other, and look on with glee to see who will triumph."" In the hip-hop genre, Lumumba-Kasongo, who is also a PhD student at Cornell, says healthy competition can ""drive innovation in the art form."" However, when female hip-hop artists are seen as competitive or possess a healthy ego about their skills, ""it's always framed as kind of cattiness."" Different stakes Male artists get compared to one another, too -- as boy bands and every ""white guy with a guitar"" who's ever competed on ""American Idol"" can attest. But the challenges facing male artists are vastly different than those facing women in the music industry. Male musicians aren't being told to ""step up"" so they can have the honor of being recognized by their industry. Their magazine profiles don't start with descriptions of their bodies and go on to demean their peers. They're not looking at festival lineups and noticing a stark imbalance . ""This idea that only one woman can exist in a space is something that's institutionalized,"" Lumumba-Kasongo says. ""We wouldn't have this pitting of women against each other if there were multitudes of slots for women to be parts of these spaces."" If women had equal representation at, for example, festivals, she says, the tendency to make female artists feel like they're vying for a precious few slots ""wouldn't become an automatic part of the conversation."" ""It's continuously, 'well, we've got our women artists, so check .' So, of course, every year, whoever is in that position is going to be compared to the person who was in that position the year prior,"" she said. Lumumba-Kasongo, who will release a new album later this year, says she finds social media and general camaraderie to be a useful tools in fighting false narratives about her and her fellow female artists. ""[It] might not work in a way that's easy to quantify, but I do feel like it pushes the culture forward when people see, you know, an Ariana Grande and a Nicki Minaj hanging out or Beyoncé and a Rihanna being in the same area,"" she says. ""That changes the conversation."" BEYONCE
— Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) February 4, 2013 Grande and Beyoncé seem to share admiration for each other. Grande pointed to Destiny's Child as a musical inspiration in a V magazine article in 2014, saying ""That's where I discovered my range. I grew up listening to Destiny's Child. I would try so hard to mimic all Beyoncé's little runs and ad-lib things. They are so precise. It's like math....Thank you, Destiny's Child!"" Beyoncé, meanwhile, once included Grande on a curated playlist in honor of her own birthday, comprised of what Queen B called ""some of the great musical talents born in the month of June."" Accomplished in her own right, Grande is Billboard's Woman of the Year and notched her fourth No. 1 album in February, but it didn't take long for a competition between the two to be teed up when she was announced as the 2019 headliner for Coachella. There's no denying that on stage last year, Beyoncé gave a spectacle of sound, a layered masterclass on black culture and a show that some will say cannot possibly be topped in our lifetimes. The beauty is, whatever Grande decides to do when she takes the stage at Coachella will be a creation all her own, truly comparable only against her other performances. It's past time for a notable change in how women are written and talked about as performers. Enough with fostering animosity between powerful, successful women. It leaves a bitter taste -- you know, something akin to lemonade without sweetener."

Backstreet Boys hit 'I Want It That Way' is 20 years old,edition.cnn.com,Harmeet Kaur,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/entertainment/backstreet-boys-i-want-it-that-way-20-years-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The Backstreet Boys have been 'wanting it that way' for two decades now.
The iconic hit song ""I Want It That Way"" was released 20 years ago Friday, and it's still unclear what exactly Nick, Howie, AJ, Brian and Kevin wanted and what way they wanted it. The boy band revisited the age-old question in a video on Twitter, posing several theories as to what ""it"" could be. 20 years of ""I Want It That Way"" have really flown by! Thank you all for your support since the release in 1999. It really means the world to us and we released a little special edition of the video for its anniversary. ❤️🙏🏻 #IWantItThatWay20 https://t.co/t51oYSIE2t pic.twitter.com/jhEFqCLOyk
— Backstreet Boys (@backstreetboys) April 12, 2019 Let's go through them, shall we? Theory 1: Burger King Read More Remember that time when you could get a Backstreet Boys CD with your Burger King value meal? Or how you'd buy a kids' meal just to get one of these action figures ? Yeah, 2000 was weird. So let's look at the facts. Burger King did go by the slogan ""Have It Your Way"" until 2014, meaning the boys would indeed have gotten it ""that way"" -- whatever ""that"" is. But the song came out a year before their partnership with the burger chain, so we're betting that's not it. Theory 2: The fans Yes, fans still go wild for the Backstreet Boys, if the nostalgia for the 20th anniversary of ""I Want It That Way"" is any indication. And it's possible that the boys appreciated their fans so much that they dedicated the first verse of their song to them, calling them ""my fire"" and ""the one desire."" But you don't have to look past the chorus before this one falls apart too. Why would they say their fans ""ain't nothing but a heartache"" or ""ain't nothing but a mistake?"" Theory 3: The song itself The song was reportedly recorded with different lyrics at first, so it's possible that the boys liked the original lyrics better. Andreas Carlsson, a Swedish hitmaker who wrote the lyrics along with Max Martin, talked to music website HitQuarters about the ordeal back in 2009: ""'I Want It That Way' was a play with words,"" he said. ""When Max came up with the original idea for the song, it already had the line 'You are my fire, the one desire.' We tried a million different variations on the second verse, and finally we had to go back to what was sounding so great, 'You are my fire, the one desire.' And then we changed it to 'Am I your fire, your one desire,' which made absolutely no sense in combination with the chorus -- but everybody loved it!"" So maybe there was never meant to be an answer? Backstreet Boys try to explain themselves Still, Chrissy Teigen nobly went in search of the truth last year. ""'I never wanna hear you say, ""I want it that way"" cause i want it that way'. He doesn't wanna hear it because he is the one that wants it that way? He wants to be the one to say it? Also what is 'it'?"" the Sports Illustrated swimsuit model asked on Twitter. The Backstreet Boys responded in their typically elusive fashion. Don't wanna hear you say that you want heartaches and mistakes... or to be 2 worlds apart. We don't want you to want ""it"" that way - that's the way we want it... for you to not want it that way. pic.twitter.com/z7YWFhH8t1

Raising an intersex child: 'This is your body. ... There's nothing to be ashamed of',edition.cnn.com,"Daniella Emanuel, CNN",04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/health/intersex-child-parenting-eprise/index.html,"(CNN) When Stephani Lohman got her first look at her newborn in the delivery room, she playfully hit her husband, Eric, on the arm. She made a flustered comment about how ultrasounds could get the sex of the child wrong.
The doctors in the Ontario hospital were silent. Eric knew that the situation was more serious than a mixup. ""I sort of looked around at that moment, and I saw what I would describe as panic on all of the medical staff's faces,"" Eric said. Stephani Lohman with Rosie in August 2012. They had expected their baby, Rosie, to be a girl, but her parents saw what seemed to be a penis. Eric remembered learning when he was getting his doctorate about babies born with genitalia that wasn't typically male or female. He realized right away that Rosie was like those babies. ""I wanted the baby to be put on my chest right away, because I just had her, and I worked really hard for that moment, and they didn't,"" Stephani said, recalling that day in 2012. ""And I was scared."" Read More The doctors covered Rosie with a blanket and took her across the room for what seemed like a long time, Eric said. When they returned, they offered what they knew: Rosie had atypical genitalia, and more tests were needed to determine whether she was genetically a girl or a boy and if she had a serious medical condition, Eric said the doctors told them. ""It basically went from very celebratory, very exciting, to very scary,"" Eric said. Eric Lohman holds Rosie in the hospital in August 2012. The next few days were filled with extensive tests and examinations until the doctors were finally able to make a diagnosis. Rosie had two X chromosomes, and so was considered to be female, they said, but she had salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a severe form of a condition called CAH for short. People with CAH are missing an enzyme that the adrenal glands need to produce cortisol. Rosie's body is unable to retain enough sodium. The adrenal glands also produce the initial ingredients of sex hormones, so when the brain gets signals that cortisol levels are low, it demands that the adrenal glands work harder. That leads to a higher production of sex hormone ingredients, which results in an excess of male hormones. Those hormones are what cause the formation of atypical genitalia in fetuses with two X chromosomes while they're in utero. Rosie's condition is classified as a DSD, or differences or disorders of sex development, by many physicians. Some patients and parents of patients -- including Eric and Stephani -- dislike this classification. They prefer the term intersex. Many conditions under the DSD/intersex umbrella could result in a variety of different physical sex characteristics on individuals, such as an enlarged clitoris or a micropenis. Atypical genitalia does not always occur in patients with CAH, but when it does, doctors sometimes encourage plastic surgery. Eric remembered learning about these operations as a student, and he was skeptical. Stephani stayed in the hospital with Rosie, who was still being monitored, and began to research the surgeries. At home, Eric did the same. They familiarized themselves with the list of potential long-term risks, such as chronic pain, an inability to orgasm or eventual rejection of gender assignment. If the doctors proposed surgery, Eric wanted to say no. Stephani didn't even anticipate that it would come up. ""My idea, because I was very naive about it, was that they would never recommend anything that wasn't necessary right now,"" Stephani said. ""Like, they wouldn't put a tiny baby under the knife for no reason. Can you imagine a world in which they're just doing cosmetic surgeries on babies? I couldn't even imagine that existed."" An 'easy' fix The surgical approach to CAH and other DSD/intersex conditions began in the 1960s, when doctors found ways to perform surgeries that reduced some of parents' anxieties about their babies. The surgeries were intended to help patients conform more with the mainstream characteristics of one sex or the other. But sometimes, the outcomes of these surgeries didn't align with patients' eventual gender identities. Over the years, some who had these surgeries grew to feel a misalignment between their sex and their gender, or felt that surgery had left them mutilated because their genitals lacked sexual sensation. This led to a wave of activism referred to as the intersex rights movement, with people speaking out and protesting medically unnecessary surgeries on children. Germany's third gender law is celebrated as a revolution. But some say it's just the first step Today, these surgeries are starting to be viewed more as cosmetic procedures instead of emergency treatments, but they are still performed. There's legislative pushback from the intersex community too, most recently seen through a California bill, SB 201. The bill would prohibit doctors from performing surgeries on minors with atypical genitalia unless the procedures are determined to be ""medically necessary"" or the child can provide informed consent beforehand. It is sponsored by Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco. The California Medical Association has formally opposed the bill and wrote a letter of opposition to the state Senate Committee on Business, Professions, and Economic Development. ""The bill makes an exception for any procedure or treatment that is deemed medically necessary, which is defined in such a way that cannot properly address the complexity of DSD cases and potentially endangers the physical and emotional health and future of the patient,"" the letter stated. In 2017, Human Rights Watch released a report on infant genital surgeries that are performed on babies with atypical genitalia, declaring it cruel and unnecessary. It provided detailed testimonials from individuals who had the surgeries and felt violated and damaged. About 1 in 2,000 babies is born with genitalia different enough that doctors might recommend surgery, according to the report. Shame, taboo, ignorance: Growing up intersex Tiger Devore, a Las Vegas-based clinical psychologist and advocate for people considered to be sexually different, said the rate of surgeries hasn't really changed since the 1960s. A 2016 study in the Journal of Pediatric Urology found that of 37 babies with what researchers called ""moderate-to-severe genital atypia"" who were born after 2011, 35 were subject to genital surgery. Devore was born in 1958 with hypospadias, a condition in which the urinary opening is on the underside of the penis instead of the tip. He had over 25 surgeries, many of them when he was a child. He describes them as painful and unnecessary. ""There are people who have grown up having these surgeries very early on in life. They're making it very clear to the medical society that these surgeries don't work, we don't like the outcomes, this shouldn't have been done to us as children,"" Devore said. ""It's our genitalia, and we want to grow up with our own genitalia. Not the genitalia that our doctors thought was right, not the genitalia our parents thought was right. It's our body."" Surgeries are typically performed to treat the anxiety of the parents, which is not fair to the infant, he said. The notion is that kids will have a better life because their genitals will look normal, but often that's not the case, he said. ""If you do plastic surgery on the genitalia, you do not magically get normal male or female genitalia. We get intersex genitalia that has had plastic surgery done to it,"" he said. The parents' decision to consent rests heavily on their education on the subject, he said. ""If they take a moment to do a little research, it can make a huge difference for the future of the child,"" he said. Feeling the pressure Three days after Rosie was born, Eric and Stephani were invited to a meeting with specialists to discuss steps. They recall walking into a room with more than a dozen medical staff: pediatric gynecologists, geneticists, pediatric urologists, endocrinologists and a social worker. ""It was probably the most intimidating room I've ever been in,"" Eric said. 'The protocol of the day was to lie': NYC issues first US 'intersex' birth certificate Rosie's parents said a pediatric urologist presented them with two options only: They could reduce the size of Rosie's clitoris and create a vaginal canal, or solely do the vaginal canal surgery. He recommended that Rosie have both procedures done simultaneously at about 6 months old, and preferably not much later than that. The argument was that the younger Rosie was, the faster she would heal, and she wouldn't have to experience looking physically different from other children. After thorough research, Rosie's parents knew that they didn't want either procedure. To their dismay, not having any surgery was never presented to them as a possibility, Eric said. And when he brought it up, the doctor said that was a choice he wouldn't recommend, due to the risk that Rosie might eventually experience psychological trauma from not looking like other girls. The rest of the staff stayed silent, Stephani said. ""It would have been nice to think that we had one ally in there, but we didn't,"" Stephani said. The doctor's sentiment was that if Rosie looked normal, she would feel better about herself. Eric and Stephani felt there was nothing wrong with appearing different, and if there was going to be a surgery, Rosie deserved a choice in the matter. They remained adamant about not consenting to the surgeries. Meanwhile, the couple was advised by the social worker to be careful when explaining Rosie's condition to other people, including her older brother and sister. Rosie at home in the summer of 2013. David Sandberg, a psychologist at University of Michigan who provides clinical services to children with DSD/intersex conditions and their families, said his first step when dealing with families who have a newborn with one of these conditions is to help them figure out the best way to share the information with people they trust. ""The story doesn't have to be all the details. But there should be nothing that would be considered a lie in retrospect,"" said Sandberg, who was not involved in Rosie's care. ""It could be a partial story. It could be less technical. But it has to be based in truth. Because once you go down the road of telling a non-truth, then it's very difficult to extricate yourself from that."" The Lohmans continued to feel pressured by their pediatric urologist to consider surgery, even as Rosie approached her first birthday. After putting their foot down and saying they wouldn't consent, the same pediatric urologist waved them away, Eric said, as if to say they would be back within a few years. (The pediatric urologist declined to comment for this story.) It's been years since that appointment, and they still haven't returned. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, its guidelines about atypical genitalia are being reviewed. ""The American Academy of Pediatrics agrees it's important that a child's medical team and parents engage in open, transparent conversations so that parents fully understand their child's condition and the risks and benefits of any proposed treatment, as well as alternatives, such as delaying surgery,"" the organization said in a statement. More US teens are rejecting 'boy' or 'girl' gender identities, a study finds Dr. Veronica Gomez-Lobo, director of pediatric and adolescent gynecology at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, said she agrees with the American Academy of Pediatrics' statement and the further goals it states of ""helping children to have a happy and healthy life."" Gomez-Lobo has worked with many families at the PROUD Clinic, which provides specialized diagnostic, evaluation and treatment services for children with complex diseases, including those that result in atypical genitalia. When an infant is born with one of these conditions, the first priority at the clinic is allowing parents to form a relationship with their child, she said. ""We don't even need to see these children until they've bonded with the parents, and so we don't even see them for an evaluation until about a month after they're born,"" she said. For patients with CAH, clinic workers first make sure that all of the medical needs are being addressed and treated, Gomez-Lobo said. After that is taken care of, they inform parents of the benefits and risks of genital surgeries, and they now mention the Human Rights Watch report, she said. ""We don't know whether making a clitoris smaller has any benefit,"" she said. ""Whether that's going to make the child grow up with a better self-image or something like that, nobody has evaluated that. But there is some literature that supports that maybe doing clitoral surgery may reduce the sensation, and it depends on how it's done and a lot of different reasons."" Out in the open After Rosie's diagnosis, the Lohmans spent a lot of time at home and were open about Rosie's condition only to family. ""Pretty soon, I started to feel like that was wrong,"" Stephani said. When they began to feel nervous about hiring babysitters who would have to change Rosie's diapers, they decided to share the secret. ""I was like, 'this is ridiculous. This is just making it shameful. Sometimes, I don't feel like we're doing her a favor,' "" Stephani said. ""We had the thought that we are contributing to this culture of shame. We're perpetuating what exactly it is we're trying to avoid."" Rosie at home in 2014. Rosie was 18 months old when they stopped hiding her condition and were frank about it with friends and others outside the family, Stephani said. At age 4, Rosie was featured in the documentary ""Gender Revolution: A Journey with Katie Couric,"" now available on Netflix. The family now lives in Milwaukee. Eric is on the board of directors of interACT, an organization dedicated to raising the visibility of intersex children and fighting for laws protecting intersex youth against surgeries. Recently, they brought Rosie to a protest at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, where they called on the facility to end the practice of medically unnecessary infant genital surgeries. In July, Eric and Stephani released a book about their experience raising an intersex child, ""Raising Rosie."" And in August, Eric flew to California to testify before the state's Committee on Health in favor of a resolution that condemned unnecessary surgery on children with intersex conditions. Weeks later, the resolution passed, making California the first state to denounce such surgeries. The resolution was introduced by Wiener, who sponsored the bill that would prohibit some of these surgeries. Outing Rosie as intersex to the public has been the most troubling decision for the Lohmans, Eric said. Eric and Stephani have written a letter for Rosie to read when she is old enough, explaining how they came to the decision to speak out about her condition. They hope she'll understand. Until then, they are focused on making her as comfortable with her body as possible. As she gets older, they plan to prepare her for how to deal with addressing her condition in front of her peers and choosing when to be private. ""If the time comes and we're like, 'OK, now she's gonna have a sleepover,' we'll say, 'well, we want you to know that this is your body, and you should feel comfortable talking about it, and you don't have to show anybody your body, but there's nothing to be ashamed of,' "" Eric said. Rosie's family, and their new puppy, now live in Milwaukee. The risks of surgery on a child with differences of sexual development are well-known, the University of Michigan's Sandberg said, but the risks of avoiding surgery  -- which is still rare  -- are not clear. When he faces a family who wants to operate on their newborn with atypical genitalia or a family who is adamantly against it, he makes sure to warn them of the risks that could result from either decision. Because there's very little published evidence on how the children who don't have surgery do growing up, all he can do is speculate. ""Being different in some way doesn't necessarily hurt you, but it is not an advantage,"" Sandberg said. ""And so one has to know something about the factors that make a child more vulnerable for being rejected or neglected by peers. And those would be things that in a gradual, developmentally appropriate way that I would tell some families. But I would sort of telegraph that early on. If I have any value at all to the family, it's engaging them in a discussion that continues over time, as the child gets older. And then, over time, engaging the child in these conversations."" On the other hand, Devore, the Las Vegas clinical psychologist, said he thinks there should be only one approach toward helping parents who have a child with one of these conditions. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
""We feel strongly that people who are ob-gyns and other people who deliver babies need to be taught to say, 'you have given birth to a healthy intersex child. Not just a male child. Not just a female child. Or a child that has problems. You have given birth to a healthy intersex child,' "" he said. "" 'Someday, that child may choose to have surgery or not. But the hospital will provide genetic counseling, neurologic counseling and psychological counseling so that your family can face this challenge in a healthy way and so that your child can be given the guidance to understand their difference.' "" Devore expects younger generations, as well as younger physicians, to be more open-minded about intersex conditions and variability of expression. The changing environment can be seen on college campuses, in the media and on Facebook, he said. Intersex is a viable identity that shouldn't be seen as unhealthy, he said. But it is just as important for individuals born with atypical genitalia to have the right to not be defined by that, either. ""If people have a sense of themselves as male or have a sense of themselves as female, no matter what their genitals look like, they get to identify that way,"" he said. ""And that's the most basic point that we could have emphasized. It is the right of the individual to determine how they choose to identify. It is not the right of the parent. It is not the right of the physician or surgeon."" Nothing out of the ordinary Rosie is now 6 years old and has never had genital surgery. She has big green eyes and blonde hair that she prefers be kept short. Dresses are among her favorite things to wear. Her parents describe her as ""intrepid"" and ""brave."" ""She wants a mohawk,"" Eric said. ""We try to tell her that having a mohawk is unpractical in Wisconsin because you have to wear a winter hat. But she wants short hair, so that's what she has."" Silas, left, and Rosie, right, in 2017. ""Rosie's awesome. She's a firecracker,"" Stephani said. They have told Rosie that her body is different from other people's but that many people have differences in their bodies. ""And that's OK,"" Eric said. If Rosie ever expressed a desire to have a clitoral reduction, Eric said, they would begin the process by having her speak to a therapist, an intersex person who had surgery and an intersex person who has not had surgery. ""If that happens in a year, then we'll start it in a year, and if it happens when she's 16, then we'll do it then,"" he said. They would urge her to wait until she's a teen, at least, and until she has experienced sexual pleasure, because of the procedure's potential effect on sexual sensations. Rosie's been taking medication for CAH since she was a baby. She now takes three pills a day to keep her cortisol and electrolyte levels balanced. Pills swallowed at 7:30 a.m., 3:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. prevent her from going into adrenal crisis. Rosie's health is stable, and she's learning to care for her condition independently. With this medical routine, Rosie's health is stabilized. She's beginning to learn how to take care of her condition independently and carries around a rescue kit in case she goes into adrenal crisis. But her parents are still concerned about what the future holds. Sicknesses and hospitalizations are inevitable with her condition, Eric said, and he's nervous about the quality of her health care when she's older -- as well as the possibility of schools and jobs being unforgiving about her having to take time off. Even though Rosie has been raised as a girl, it's important to her parents to refer to her as intersex and to encourage gender fluidity. In other words, they don't confine her gender expression to that of a boy or a girl. Since Rosie identifies as a girl, her parents check off ""female"" under the sex category when filling out forms. She's in first grade this year and has developed a group of core friends. She uses the girls' bathroom and has yet to be confronted by other students about her body. But they are confident that with her type of personality, she'll either not care or laugh about it, if anyone were to point out her differences. Her teachers are aware of her condition and have been compassionate, he said. Parents in their community have also been accepting. ""As of right now, she's very stable, and we have a very supportive network,"" Eric said. ""It's almost as if nobody cares about the intersex part of her."""
Walmart wants to build its advertising business - CNN,www.cnn.com,Nathaniel Meyersohn,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/business/walmart-advertising-amazon-google/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Walmart is serious about giving Amazon a run for its money online. It's so determined that the company bought a startup to help it compete in an unexpected business: online advertising.
The retailer on Thursday bought Polymorph Labs, a Silicon Valley startup that specializes in managing digital ads for brands. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Walmart said adding the startup's technology would enable current and potential advertisers to reach consumers more effectively. The acquisition positions Walmart to compete with Amazon ( AMZN ) , which became the country's third largest ad platform last year behind Google ( GOOG ) and Facebook ( FB ) . ""Our data has never been monetized, and we have a tiny ad business,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told analysts last year. ""It could be bigger."" Walmart's strategy to solve the Amazon puzzle is working Walmart hopes its pitch to consumer brands will stick. It's playing up the fact that it has a huge network of physical stores that it can use to recruit brands. Walmart says it has a trove of shopper data because 90% of America shops at Walmart every year, and its website and stores attract nearly 160 million visitors a week. Read More ""We can help brands understand if someone saw their ad on Walmart's platform or across the [internet], and then purchased the product in-store or online,"" said Stefanie Jay, vice president and general manager for Walmart Media Group. Walmart's ""scale and data could give it a unique opportunity to expand"" its ad business, UBS analyst Michael Lasser said in a research report last month. Walmart wants to squeeze out more digital advertising dollars because its profit is under pressure. The company sold $184 billion worth of groceries in the United States last year, more than a third of its more than $500 billion in sales. But groceries carry razor-thin margins. Walmart has also sacrificed profit in recent years by investing billions of dollars to build out its digital operation, lower its prices and add online pickup to thousands of stores. Profit has fallen three years in a row. But Walmart believes that building new revenue streams, such as advertising, health care and financial services, can help offset its heavy spending and boost profit. ""Retailers will need to innovate and find new profit pools,"" Lasser said. ""Pivoting traditional retail business models won't be easy, but will be necessary over time."" The retailer faces challenges, however. Walmart chief financial officer Brent Biggs told analysts at a conference last month that Walmart needed to be careful to prevent its website from becoming ""cluttered"" with ads. Rival grocers and retailers that want to expand their digital ad businesses also pose an obstacle for Walmart. Last year, Kroger ( KR ) , Albertsons and Ahold Delhaize all made big pushes into advertising. Kroger, for example, believes it has an opportunity to sell brands ads on its store shelves, and it's tapping Microsoft ( MSFT ) to help. The two companies struck a partnership in January to pilot two stores in Ohio and Washington State. Instead of paper tags for prices and promotions on the two stores' shelves, they will be digital. That creates room for Kroger to sell advertising space to brands. "
Tornado touches down in Texas as severe storm system threatens Southeast,edition.cnn.com,Allie Mazurek and Judson Jones,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/tornado-texas-southeast-storms-wxc/index.html,"(CNN) Storms hammered east Texas on Saturday, with two children killed when a tree fell on a car, authorities said.
The children, ages 3 and 8, were in the back seat with their parents in the front when the tree fell on their vehicle around 3 p.m., said Angelina County Sheriff's Department Captain Alton Lenderman. The children were pronounced dead at the scene. A preliminary damage survey found that a tornado with peak intensity of EF-3 and winds up to 140 mph touched down in Robertson County, according to a tweet from the National Weather Service in Forth Worth. There were reports of multiple injuries in the Robertson County town of Franklin, the NWS said, and CNN affiliate KWTX reported widespread damage there. Trees were pulled up by the roots, roofs torn off buildings, and the cinder block foundation was all that was left of a mobile home in the town, which is southeast of Waco. The entire town of Franklin and neighboring Bremond lost electricity, with power expected to be restored Saturday night. Read More To the north, dime-sized hail pounded the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Texas is seeing the beginning of the dangerous and severe storms forecast to slam parts of the Southeast and Ohio River Valley this weekend. The powerful system will create the potential for life-threatening winds, strong tornadoes and large hail. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a moderate risk (level 4 out of 5) for severe weather Saturday across parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley. And Sunday, an enhanced risk (level 3 out of 5) stretches from Atlanta to Cleveland. 4 tornado safety tips that could save your life Severe storms possible from Texas to Mississippi Track the storms with CNN's storm tracker CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said the warm air present during the afternoon enhanced the atmosphere's instability, creating more energy for storms to tap into and aiding in their development. He said the threat for severe weather is greatest at such times. The storms most capable of producing tornadoes and large hail will be the individual, rotating cells that form ahead of a larger complex of thunderstorms. Tornadoes possible overnight in Alabama By late Saturday, the storms were expected to organize into a line as they cross the western border of Mississippi. The system will begin to move through Alabama overnight and is expected to reach Georgia by Sunday morning. The energy from warm afternoon temperatures will diminish, but the risk for tornadoes will not be over. ""The storm is so vigorous that tornadoes are still possible after dark,"" Myers said. Tornadoes at that time can be especially dangerous since they are difficult to see and people are less likely to receive warnings while they're asleep. Georgia, the southern Appalachians and Ohio Valley The most significant risk of severe weather is expected Saturday, but there's still considerable potential Sunday. The Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk across a broad area, stretching from eastern Alabama through the southern Appalachians and into the Ohio Valley. The main line of storms will begin to push into this area late Sunday morning and trek to the east on Sunday afternoon. The center said it expects the threat of severe weather to increase throughout the afternoon. ""Damaging winds appear to be the greatest threat on Sunday, but tornadoes will also be possible,"" CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. The risk will slowly diminish as the system begins to weaken Sunday evening. Sunday tee times moved up at The Masters Georgia's Augusta National Golf Club is included in the slight risk area Sunday as the Masters golf tournament concludes. Tournament organizers have moved up tee times for Sunday because of the storm threat. The storms are expected to move through the Augusta area during the afternoon and evening. The tornado threat will be lower by then, but damaging winds could still present hazardous conditions."

"Morehouse College to begin admitting transgender students in 2020, school says",edition.cnn.com,Amir Vera,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/morehouse-college-transgender-policy/index.html,"Atlanta (CNN) Morehouse College, a historically black all-men's school in Atlanta, will begin admitting transgender students who identify as men in 2020, according to a news release from the school.
The new policy, known as the Gender Identity Admissions and Matriculation Policy , applies to all students who enroll in the private college by the fall 2020 semester. The announcement comes after Spelman College, a private historically black all-women's school in Atlanta, adopted a similar policy in 2017. ""In a rapidly changing world that includes a better understanding of gender identity, we're proud to expand our admissions policy to consider trans men who want to be part of an institution that has produced some of the greatest leaders in social justice, politics, business, and the arts for more than 150 years,"" said Terrance Dixon, Morehouse vice president for enrollment management. ""The ratification of this policy affirms the College's commitment to develop men with disciplined minds who will lead lives of leadership and service."" Policy only allows for trans men to be admitted Read More The policy was developed after 15 months of community engagement with faculty, staff, students and alumni, the release says. Morehouse President David A. Thomas created a task force that led the community engagement meetings. ""Morehouse College has been at the forefront of human rights issues for 152 years,"" Thomas said in a statement to CNN. ""Today's vote to reaffirm our dedication to educating and developing men, including trans men, is an important step into one of the new frontiers of social justice — gender identity."" The policy also states that students who are admitted into Morehouse ""are expected to self-identify as men throughout their education at Morehouse,"" the release states. Should a student transition from a man to a woman, the student would no longer be eligible to enroll at the school, the release states. Trans women, or any person who identifies as a woman, will not be considered for admission into the school, the release says. Morehouse spokeswoman Aileen Dodd said students who identified as trans women before 2020 are eligible to graduate from Morehouse, but are not permitted to graduate from the school after 2020. A trans woman is a person who was born a man but transitioned to become a woman. There will be a system in place to consider exemptions to the rule, with the Morehouse president having the final say, the release says. Other historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) that have nondiscrimination policies addressing gender identity include Tuskegee University in Alabama, Howard University in Washington, Florida A&M University, Southern University and A&M College in Louisiana, North Carolina Central University and Morgan State University in Maryland. Students, alumni react to new policy There were differing views on the announcement. Titi Naomi Tukes, who graduated from Morehouse in 2017, is not a fan of the new policy. ""I unequivocally disapprove of it because it is exclusionary of trans women or gender non-conforming and non-binary students,"" said Tukes, who uses the pronouns they, them and theirs. Tukes said when students go to college they usually don't know themselves and, over the course of their college career, can question their religion, sexuality or gender. ""In this case the college would expel students for something they have no control over,"" Tukes said. They added that the new policy will ""embolden faculty, staff and administrators who already target and discriminate against transgender women and non-binary students."" Tatiana Rafael is one such student. A senior sociology major, Rafael identifies as a transsexual woman who began transitioning six months after she began attending Morehouse in 2017. ""Morehouse is missing a chance to be progressive and inclusive in that way,"" Rafael said. She admits she doesn't feel welcome at Morehouse. ""I felt pretty marginalized and erased. I was never included in the image of the school. I was kind of just there by default,"" she said, adding she feels there's no place for a trans woman in the image of Morehouse. Rafael did say, however, she sees the benefit of the new policy and what it can do for trans men. ""I think for trans men, it's going to be a great experience because they now have opportunity to attend one of the top schools for black men,"" she said. Robert Brown, an alumnus who graduated in 1996, said he's excited to see the evolution of the policy. ""When I was at Morehouse it was much more homophobic and much more transphobic,"" he said. ""It's great to see the school embrace a broader spectrum of students."" Brown said there's always been an LGBTQ population at Morehouse, but this new policy is taking ""important steps to enfranchising this population, rather than pretending they don't exist."" Morehouse, which has an enrollment of 2,202, instituted a policy in 2009 banning its male students from wearing women's clothes, makeup or high heels in what was called the ""Appropriate Attire Policy."" The move was in response to five gay students who, said a school official at the time, weren't dressing the way Morehouse men are expected to dress. In 2013, according to the school's newspaper The Maroon Tiger, Morehouse began offering a course on black LGBTQ history and culture."

McGill University sports teams drop 'Redmen' name amid criticism,edition.cnn.com,Nicole Chavez,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/americas/mcgill-university-redmen-name/index.html,"(CNN) McGill University will no longer use the name Redmen for its men's varsity sports teams after students argued the term was a racial slur.
Suzanne Fortier, the school's principal and vice-chancellor, announced her decision Friday, saying the name made indigenous students feel alienated. ""They feel disrespected and unconsidered. They feel conflicted over their rightful pride in being Indigenous people, and their pride in being McGill students,"" Fortier said in a statement. ""This tension is even stronger for Indigenous student-athletes."" Fortier noted the university in Montreal had not adopted the name as a reference to North American indigenous peoples but said that perceptions have since then changed. ""McGill did not adopt the Redmen name as a reference to North American Indigenous peoples. However, the name has been associated with Indigenous peoples at different points in our history. Today, 'Redmen' is widely acknowledged as an offensive term for Indigenous peoples, as evidenced by major English dictionaries,"" the principal said. Read More ""While this derogatory meaning of the word does not reflect the beliefs of generations of McGill athletes who have proudly competed wearing the University's colours, we cannot ignore this contemporary understanding. Intention, however benign, does not negate prejudicial effect."" Fortier said the change is effective immediately and the teams will be be known as only ""McGill"" for the upcoming athletic season. The school said the decision does not affect the women's teams, which are called the Martlets. The name is a reference to a mythical bird that cannot land because it has no feet. The school has used the name Redmen since the late 1920s and it was originally a reference to the red uniforms worn by the sports team, according to the school's website. The reference to indigenous people began in the 1950s when the school adopted a logo depicting an indigenous man wearing a headdress. All signage, banners, flags, clothing and other branded items on campus are expected to be removed by the fall semester. However, the Redmen name will remain in the school's sports hall of fame and ""on existing items of historical significance"" such as trophies and championship photos, the school said . The school is expected to pick a new name that ""everyone can wear, and cheer for, with pride"" for the 2020-2021 season, Fortier said. American sports teams have recently faced similar criticism due to their names and logos. Last year, the MLB's Cleveland Indians parted ways with their Chief Wahoo logo and removed the Native American caricature this season from the team's jerseys. The team had used the image far less frequently for a few years and adopted a ""C"" as its main logo. In 2001, Colgate University in New York state changed the name of their sports teams from the Red Raiders to just ""Raiders"" to move away from what it said was a racial stereotype. The name was coined as a reference to the maroon color of the football team's jerseys and not to Native Americans, but the school said it could still be seen as offensive. Native American groups and some politicians, including former President Barack Obama, have pressured the NFL's Washington Redskins to consider a name change but its owner, Daniel Snyder, has insisted the name its not offensive to Native Americans."
Writers Guild of America calls for mass firings of agents - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Brian Stelter,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/media/writers-guild-agents-hollywood/index.html,"(CNN) Hollywood's biggest labor battle in a decade is officially underway. The issue, as is usually the case, is money.
The Writers Guild of America is taking action against the industry's biggest talent agencies. A bevy of writers who are members of the guild have broken off ties with the agents who usually represent them. The guild has 15,000 members, so the action could have sweeping consequences. This mass firing of agents has never happened before, so no one quite knows what's going to happen or how long it's going to last. The two sides had been holding contentious negotiations until Friday, when the writers had set a deadline for talent agencies to accept its new ""code of conduct."" A few hours before the deadline, the guild told its members that talks had failed, so it was time to cut ties with the agents. Read More The Association of Talent Agents said Friday night that the writers guild wants ""chaos"" that ""will hurt all artists."" Here's who made Hollywood Reporter's list of most powerful figures in New York media But the guild said the agents have not adequately addressed ""our expressed concerns"" about packaging fees and other issues. Here is how the writers guild frames the issues: ""Our agents work for us. Every dollar they make must be generated as a percentage of the money we make. That is what it means to be our representatives and our fiduciaries. Agency-based studios and packaging fees make a mockery of that and are in violation of the agencies' ethical and legal obligations to writers."" Packaging fees are lucrative payments that agencies receive for putting together multiple clients -- say, a writer and a director and an actor -- as a ""package"" for a TV studio. The National Enquirer is for sale The writers guild says it wants to ""realign agency incentives so they are consistent with, rather than competing with, the interests of writer clients."" Thus, the new ""code of conduct."" One of the guild's slogans has been ""clients over conflicts."" Screenwriter John August, who wrote films like ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""Big Fish,"" tweeted , ""My agent of 20+ years is a great friend and fighter for my career. I would give him a kidney tomorrow. But this isn't about him or any single agent. Until agencies put #ClientsOverConflicts we can't work together. Simple as that."" Famous Hollywood names like Damon Lindelof, Hart Hanson and David Simon have posted their agent termination letters on social media. The four big talent agencies in the US are WME, CAA, UTA and ICM. They, and other smaller agencies, are represented by the Association of Talent Agents. Karen Stuart, the association's executive director, said in a statement that the ""code of conduct"" will ""hurt all artists, delivering an especially painful blow to mid-level and emerging writers, while dictating how agencies of all sizes should function."" Stuart said ""we came to the negotiating table in good faith and put forth comprehensive proposals,"" but the guild ""refused to negotiate further."" ""We're prepared to continue to fight for the best interests of writers and all artists,"" she added. There is no indication that further talks are scheduled right now."
Raising an intersex child: 'This is your body. ... There's nothing to be ashamed of' - CNN,www.cnn.com,"Daniella Emanuel, CNN",04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/13/health/intersex-child-parenting-eprise/index.html,"(CNN) When Stephani Lohman got her first look at her newborn in the delivery room, she playfully hit her husband, Eric, on the arm. She made a flustered comment about how ultrasounds could get the sex of the child wrong.
The doctors in the Ontario hospital were silent. Eric knew that the situation was more serious than a mixup. ""I sort of looked around at that moment, and I saw what I would describe as panic on all of the medical staff's faces,"" Eric said. Stephani Lohman with Rosie in August 2012. They had expected their baby, Rosie, to be a girl, but her parents saw what seemed to be a penis. Eric remembered learning when he was getting his doctorate about babies born with genitalia that wasn't typically male or female. He realized right away that Rosie was like those babies. ""I wanted the baby to be put on my chest right away, because I just had her, and I worked really hard for that moment, and they didn't,"" Stephani said, recalling that day in 2012. ""And I was scared."" Read More The doctors covered Rosie with a blanket and took her across the room for what seemed like a long time, Eric said. When they returned, they offered what they knew: Rosie had atypical genitalia, and more tests were needed to determine whether she was genetically a girl or a boy and if she had a serious medical condition, Eric said the doctors told them. ""It basically went from very celebratory, very exciting, to very scary,"" Eric said. Eric Lohman holds Rosie in the hospital in August 2012. The next few days were filled with extensive tests and examinations until the doctors were finally able to make a diagnosis. Rosie had two X chromosomes, and so was considered to be female, they said, but she had salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a severe form of a condition called CAH for short. People with CAH are missing an enzyme that the adrenal glands need to produce cortisol. Rosie's body is unable to retain enough sodium. The adrenal glands also produce the initial ingredients of sex hormones, so when the brain gets signals that cortisol levels are low, it demands that the adrenal glands work harder. That leads to a higher production of sex hormone ingredients, which results in an excess of male hormones. Those hormones are what cause the formation of atypical genitalia in fetuses with two X chromosomes while they're in utero. Rosie's condition is classified as a DSD, or differences or disorders of sex development, by many physicians. Some patients and parents of patients -- including Eric and Stephani -- dislike this classification. They prefer the term intersex. Many conditions under the DSD/intersex umbrella could result in a variety of different physical sex characteristics on individuals, such as an enlarged clitoris or a micropenis. Atypical genitalia does not always occur in patients with CAH, but when it does, doctors sometimes encourage plastic surgery. Eric remembered learning about these operations as a student, and he was skeptical. Stephani stayed in the hospital with Rosie, who was still being monitored, and began to research the surgeries. At home, Eric did the same. They familiarized themselves with the list of potential long-term risks, such as chronic pain, an inability to orgasm or eventual rejection of gender assignment. If the doctors proposed surgery, Eric wanted to say no. Stephani didn't even anticipate that it would come up. ""My idea, because I was very naive about it, was that they would never recommend anything that wasn't necessary right now,"" Stephani said. ""Like, they wouldn't put a tiny baby under the knife for no reason. Can you imagine a world in which they're just doing cosmetic surgeries on babies? I couldn't even imagine that existed."" An 'easy' fix The surgical approach to CAH and other DSD/intersex conditions began in the 1960s, when doctors found ways to perform surgeries that reduced some of parents' anxieties about their babies. The surgeries were intended to help patients conform more with the mainstream characteristics of one sex or the other. But sometimes, the outcomes of these surgeries didn't align with patients' eventual gender identities. Over the years, some who had these surgeries grew to feel a misalignment between their sex and their gender, or felt that surgery had left them mutilated because their genitals lacked sexual sensation. This led to a wave of activism referred to as the intersex rights movement, with people speaking out and protesting medically unnecessary surgeries on children. Germany's third gender law is celebrated as a revolution. But some say it's just the first step Today, these surgeries are starting to be viewed more as cosmetic procedures instead of emergency treatments, but they are still performed. There's legislative pushback from the intersex community too, most recently seen through a California bill, SB 201. The bill would prohibit doctors from performing surgeries on minors with atypical genitalia unless the procedures are determined to be ""medically necessary"" or the child can provide informed consent beforehand. It is sponsored by Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco. The California Medical Association has formally opposed the bill and wrote a letter of opposition to the state Senate Committee on Business, Professions, and Economic Development. ""The bill makes an exception for any procedure or treatment that is deemed medically necessary, which is defined in such a way that cannot properly address the complexity of DSD cases and potentially endangers the physical and emotional health and future of the patient,"" the letter stated. In 2017, Human Rights Watch released a report on infant genital surgeries that are performed on babies with atypical genitalia, declaring it cruel and unnecessary. It provided detailed testimonials from individuals who had the surgeries and felt violated and damaged. About 1 in 2,000 babies is born with genitalia different enough that doctors might recommend surgery, according to the report. Shame, taboo, ignorance: Growing up intersex Tiger Devore, a Las Vegas-based clinical psychologist and advocate for people considered to be sexually different, said the rate of surgeries hasn't really changed since the 1960s. A 2016 study in the Journal of Pediatric Urology found that of 37 babies with what researchers called ""moderate-to-severe genital atypia"" who were born after 2011, 35 were subject to genital surgery. Devore was born in 1958 with hypospadias, a condition in which the urinary opening is on the underside of the penis instead of the tip. He had over 25 surgeries, many of them when he was a child. He describes them as painful and unnecessary. ""There are people who have grown up having these surgeries very early on in life. They're making it very clear to the medical society that these surgeries don't work, we don't like the outcomes, this shouldn't have been done to us as children,"" Devore said. ""It's our genitalia, and we want to grow up with our own genitalia. Not the genitalia that our doctors thought was right, not the genitalia our parents thought was right. It's our body."" Surgeries are typically performed to treat the anxiety of the parents, which is not fair to the infant, he said. The notion is that kids will have a better life because their genitals will look normal, but often that's not the case, he said. ""If you do plastic surgery on the genitalia, you do not magically get normal male or female genitalia. We get intersex genitalia that has had plastic surgery done to it,"" he said. The parents' decision to consent rests heavily on their education on the subject, he said. ""If they take a moment to do a little research, it can make a huge difference for the future of the child,"" he said. Feeling the pressure Three days after Rosie was born, Eric and Stephani were invited to a meeting with specialists to discuss steps. They recall walking into a room with more than a dozen medical staff: pediatric gynecologists, geneticists, pediatric urologists, endocrinologists and a social worker. ""It was probably the most intimidating room I've ever been in,"" Eric said. 'The protocol of the day was to lie': NYC issues first US 'intersex' birth certificate Rosie's parents said a pediatric urologist presented them with two options only: They could reduce the size of Rosie's clitoris and create a vaginal canal, or solely do the vaginal canal surgery. He recommended that Rosie have both procedures done simultaneously at about 6 months old, and preferably not much later than that. The argument was that the younger Rosie was, the faster she would heal, and she wouldn't have to experience looking physically different from other children. After thorough research, Rosie's parents knew that they didn't want either procedure. To their dismay, not having any surgery was never presented to them as a possibility, Eric said. And when he brought it up, the doctor said that was a choice he wouldn't recommend, due to the risk that Rosie might eventually experience psychological trauma from not looking like other girls. The rest of the staff stayed silent, Stephani said. ""It would have been nice to think that we had one ally in there, but we didn't,"" Stephani said. The doctor's sentiment was that if Rosie looked normal, she would feel better about herself. Eric and Stephani felt there was nothing wrong with appearing different, and if there was going to be a surgery, Rosie deserved a choice in the matter. They remained adamant about not consenting to the surgeries. Meanwhile, the couple was advised by the social worker to be careful when explaining Rosie's condition to other people, including her older brother and sister. Rosie at home in the summer of 2013. David Sandberg, a psychologist at University of Michigan who provides clinical services to children with DSD/intersex conditions and their families, said his first step when dealing with families who have a newborn with one of these conditions is to help them figure out the best way to share the information with people they trust. ""The story doesn't have to be all the details. But there should be nothing that would be considered a lie in retrospect,"" said Sandberg, who was not involved in Rosie's care. ""It could be a partial story. It could be less technical. But it has to be based in truth. Because once you go down the road of telling a non-truth, then it's very difficult to extricate yourself from that."" The Lohmans continued to feel pressured by their pediatric urologist to consider surgery, even as Rosie approached her first birthday. After putting their foot down and saying they wouldn't consent, the same pediatric urologist waved them away, Eric said, as if to say they would be back within a few years. (The pediatric urologist declined to comment for this story.) It's been years since that appointment, and they still haven't returned. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, its guidelines about atypical genitalia are being reviewed. ""The American Academy of Pediatrics agrees it's important that a child's medical team and parents engage in open, transparent conversations so that parents fully understand their child's condition and the risks and benefits of any proposed treatment, as well as alternatives, such as delaying surgery,"" the organization said in a statement. More US teens are rejecting 'boy' or 'girl' gender identities, a study finds Dr. Veronica Gomez-Lobo, director of pediatric and adolescent gynecology at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, said she agrees with the American Academy of Pediatrics' statement and the further goals it states of ""helping children to have a happy and healthy life."" Gomez-Lobo has worked with many families at the PROUD Clinic, which provides specialized diagnostic, evaluation and treatment services for children with complex diseases, including those that result in atypical genitalia. When an infant is born with one of these conditions, the first priority at the clinic is allowing parents to form a relationship with their child, she said. ""We don't even need to see these children until they've bonded with the parents, and so we don't even see them for an evaluation until about a month after they're born,"" she said. For patients with CAH, clinic workers first make sure that all of the medical needs are being addressed and treated, Gomez-Lobo said. After that is taken care of, they inform parents of the benefits and risks of genital surgeries, and they now mention the Human Rights Watch report, she said. ""We don't know whether making a clitoris smaller has any benefit,"" she said. ""Whether that's going to make the child grow up with a better self-image or something like that, nobody has evaluated that. But there is some literature that supports that maybe doing clitoral surgery may reduce the sensation, and it depends on how it's done and a lot of different reasons."" Out in the open After Rosie's diagnosis, the Lohmans spent a lot of time at home and were open about Rosie's condition only to family. ""Pretty soon, I started to feel like that was wrong,"" Stephani said. When they began to feel nervous about hiring babysitters who would have to change Rosie's diapers, they decided to share the secret. ""I was like, 'this is ridiculous. This is just making it shameful. Sometimes, I don't feel like we're doing her a favor,' "" Stephani said. ""We had the thought that we are contributing to this culture of shame. We're perpetuating what exactly it is we're trying to avoid."" Rosie at home in 2014. Rosie was 18 months old when they stopped hiding her condition and were frank about it with friends and others outside the family, Stephani said. At age 4, Rosie was featured in the documentary ""Gender Revolution: A Journey with Katie Couric,"" now available on Netflix. The family now lives in Milwaukee. Eric is on the board of directors of interACT, an organization dedicated to raising the visibility of intersex children and fighting for laws protecting intersex youth against surgeries. Recently, they brought Rosie to a protest at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, where they called on the facility to end the practice of medically unnecessary infant genital surgeries. In July, Eric and Stephani released a book about their experience raising an intersex child, ""Raising Rosie."" And in August, Eric flew to California to testify before the state's Committee on Health in favor of a resolution that condemned unnecessary surgery on children with intersex conditions. Weeks later, the resolution passed, making California the first state to denounce such surgeries. The resolution was introduced by Wiener, who sponsored the bill that would prohibit some of these surgeries. Outing Rosie as intersex to the public has been the most troubling decision for the Lohmans, Eric said. Eric and Stephani have written a letter for Rosie to read when she is old enough, explaining how they came to the decision to speak out about her condition. They hope she'll understand. Until then, they are focused on making her as comfortable with her body as possible. As she gets older, they plan to prepare her for how to deal with addressing her condition in front of her peers and choosing when to be private. ""If the time comes and we're like, 'OK, now she's gonna have a sleepover,' we'll say, 'well, we want you to know that this is your body, and you should feel comfortable talking about it, and you don't have to show anybody your body, but there's nothing to be ashamed of,' "" Eric said. Rosie's family, and their new puppy, now live in Milwaukee. The risks of surgery on a child with differences of sexual development are well-known, the University of Michigan's Sandberg said, but the risks of avoiding surgery  -- which is still rare  -- are not clear. When he faces a family who wants to operate on their newborn with atypical genitalia or a family who is adamantly against it, he makes sure to warn them of the risks that could result from either decision. Because there's very little published evidence on how the children who don't have surgery do growing up, all he can do is speculate. ""Being different in some way doesn't necessarily hurt you, but it is not an advantage,"" Sandberg said. ""And so one has to know something about the factors that make a child more vulnerable for being rejected or neglected by peers. And those would be things that in a gradual, developmentally appropriate way that I would tell some families. But I would sort of telegraph that early on. If I have any value at all to the family, it's engaging them in a discussion that continues over time, as the child gets older. And then, over time, engaging the child in these conversations."" On the other hand, Devore, the Las Vegas clinical psychologist, said he thinks there should be only one approach toward helping parents who have a child with one of these conditions. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
""We feel strongly that people who are ob-gyns and other people who deliver babies need to be taught to say, 'you have given birth to a healthy intersex child. Not just a male child. Not just a female child. Or a child that has problems. You have given birth to a healthy intersex child,' "" he said. "" 'Someday, that child may choose to have surgery or not. But the hospital will provide genetic counseling, neurologic counseling and psychological counseling so that your family can face this challenge in a healthy way and so that your child can be given the guidance to understand their difference.' "" Devore expects younger generations, as well as younger physicians, to be more open-minded about intersex conditions and variability of expression. The changing environment can be seen on college campuses, in the media and on Facebook, he said. Intersex is a viable identity that shouldn't be seen as unhealthy, he said. But it is just as important for individuals born with atypical genitalia to have the right to not be defined by that, either. ""If people have a sense of themselves as male or have a sense of themselves as female, no matter what their genitals look like, they get to identify that way,"" he said. ""And that's the most basic point that we could have emphasized. It is the right of the individual to determine how they choose to identify. It is not the right of the parent. It is not the right of the physician or surgeon."" Nothing out of the ordinary Rosie is now 6 years old and has never had genital surgery. She has big green eyes and blonde hair that she prefers be kept short. Dresses are among her favorite things to wear. Her parents describe her as ""intrepid"" and ""brave."" ""She wants a mohawk,"" Eric said. ""We try to tell her that having a mohawk is unpractical in Wisconsin because you have to wear a winter hat. But she wants short hair, so that's what she has."" Silas, left, and Rosie, right, in 2017. ""Rosie's awesome. She's a firecracker,"" Stephani said. They have told Rosie that her body is different from other people's but that many people have differences in their bodies. ""And that's OK,"" Eric said. If Rosie ever expressed a desire to have a clitoral reduction, Eric said, they would begin the process by having her speak to a therapist, an intersex person who had surgery and an intersex person who has not had surgery. ""If that happens in a year, then we'll start it in a year, and if it happens when she's 16, then we'll do it then,"" he said. They would urge her to wait until she's a teen, at least, and until she has experienced sexual pleasure, because of the procedure's potential effect on sexual sensations. Rosie's been taking medication for CAH since she was a baby. She now takes three pills a day to keep her cortisol and electrolyte levels balanced. Pills swallowed at 7:30 a.m., 3:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. prevent her from going into adrenal crisis. Rosie's health is stable, and she's learning to care for her condition independently. With this medical routine, Rosie's health is stabilized. She's beginning to learn how to take care of her condition independently and carries around a rescue kit in case she goes into adrenal crisis. But her parents are still concerned about what the future holds. Sicknesses and hospitalizations are inevitable with her condition, Eric said, and he's nervous about the quality of her health care when she's older -- as well as the possibility of schools and jobs being unforgiving about her having to take time off. Even though Rosie has been raised as a girl, it's important to her parents to refer to her as intersex and to encourage gender fluidity. In other words, they don't confine her gender expression to that of a boy or a girl. Since Rosie identifies as a girl, her parents check off ""female"" under the sex category when filling out forms. She's in first grade this year and has developed a group of core friends. She uses the girls' bathroom and has yet to be confronted by other students about her body. But they are confident that with her type of personality, she'll either not care or laugh about it, if anyone were to point out her differences. Her teachers are aware of her condition and have been compassionate, he said. Parents in their community have also been accepting. ""As of right now, she's very stable, and we have a very supportive network,"" Eric said. ""It's almost as if nobody cares about the intersex part of her."" "

(CNN) This Sunday the curtain rises on the final season of HBO's ""Game of Thrones."" If you aren't already a fan, you will still want to take a seat for the battle between Ice and Fire. The show is a master class in the importance of being resilient. If you are already a fan, you probably know what Arya Stark says when her Braavosi sword-trainer, Syrio Forel, asks, ""What do we say to the God of Death?"" Arya's response is one we all must remember, even if we aren't carrying a sword. Arya answers: ""Not today.""
This line exemplifies the fearless grit that Arya shows as she trains to be an assassin -- and she's not the only character who confronts danger and finds the necessary strength to persevere. Although her sister, Sansa Stark -- who is far more posh and put together -- faces unthinkable psychological and physical abuse, she also finds her way out of her horrible imprisonments and turns adversity in her favor. In the first season, the Stark sisters leave their home in the frigid north, with one hoping to learn to use her sword, while the other plans to marry the dapper Prince Joffrey. The journey south doesn't go well for either of them. In the capital of Westeros, King's Landing, they are forced to confront unthinkable odds. They face brutal situations where it would be understandable to fail and easy to give up. But both young women choose instead to face their challenges and, as the series continues, operate with remarkable resilience. The show, based on George R.R. Martin's epic fantasy series ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" (Bantam Books), is far more violent than what most of us confront in our daily lives, so it might seem like a stretch to compare the fantasy to reality. But if you dig deep into the fictional struggles in Essos and Westeros, you'll find that, even if you don't bring dragons and swords to work, there are parallels to our real life adventures. Looking back on my own life, I can see similar themes. All the latest on the final season of 'Game of Thrones' In the mid-'90s, at age 35, I found myself nearing the end of my first night working at a bar in Manhattan and subleasing an apartment in New York's Lower East Side. The apartment had wood floors that needed varnishing, a toilet in a closet by the front door and a bathtub in the kitchen. Nothing I faced was comparable to the young Stark women's challenging journeys in ""Game of Thrones,"" but I felt the weight of my own recent struggles. I had just returned to New York City after a year of attempting to break into screenwriting in Hollywood. My first novel had been published two years earlier and I thought I could parlay that into a career writing both novels and screenplays. I was wrong. Read More Los Angeles was my hometown, but my move to Hollywood was not unlike Sansa's trip to King's Landing: I was excited about the adventure and expected perfect results. Instead, like many others who attempt to break into a new industry, I found myself in a competitive world and an environment I didn't fully understand. I might not have been confined in the Red Keep, threatened by Queen Cersei, but that didn't mean it was easy. I lost two people close to me that year as I was writing in Hollywood. My former mentor and boss at Columbia Business School, Mary Anne Devanna, passed away. I knew she was ill, but didn't quite understand how serious it was until she phoned me in California and told me about her situation. Then, just like that, she was gone. My good friend, Tim Dwight, was also fighting to stay alive in Santa Monica. He was brave beyond anything I could imagine, but he didn't make it either. 'Game of Thrones' ending comes with HBO at a crossroads That Christmas Eve, I went to bed, feeling like a failure in my professional work. I couldn't make money to sustain myself as a writer. Both a script and a novel had been on the verge of selling, but hadn't sold. I had no money for food, rent or gas for my vintage Mercury, not to mention any cash to buy Christmas gifts for my parents or sisters. My failures felt daunting, but I woke up on Christmas Day and realized it was time to push forward. I had no reason to complain. I had reported to a woman as encouraging as Mary Anne, who helped me learn about business education. I had been chosen as a friend by someone as supportive as Tim, who helped me believe in my writing abilities. The fact they both had passed away too early hurt. It is still with me, but I also felt lucky to have known them. I understood that I was blessed. People in my life believed I could make it, and I needed to keep believing in myself. I realized I was hungry to write more and keep fighting. The fairy tale I had pursued in Hollywood didn't pan out, but I found a new, temporary home for myself back in New York City. I spent some time sleeping on friends' floors before I found that apartment, and worked temp jobs filing microfiche before I started bartending. It wasn't glamorous, but I focused on the positives. I was meeting new, creative people. My battered, poetic apartment was perfect in the cold New York winter, when I could take a hot bath in my kitchen, open the large windows and watch snow drift down from the sky. On sunny days, the apartment was filled with light. There was a tiny black-and-white TV, on which I used to watch ""The Simpsons."" There was a large desk where I could write. And now their watch is ended: How fans are bracing for life after 'Game of Thrones' I kept working toward my goals, even when they seemed out of reach. I had a passion for writing, as Arya had a passion for fighting. And, as I returned to work for Columbia Business School, I found a new passion for teaching leadership. After Sansa's dreams of marrying Prince Joffrey collapsed, she was guided by a new passion to return to Winterfell, and regain her home from those who had hurt her family. My resilience is not comparable to that shown by Arya and Sansa, but I still remind myself that when my back was against the wall as a writer, I chose to soldier on instead of deciding to quit. In life, we all face unforgiving competition, unpredictable adversity, occasional betrayal, and too often: doubt and despair. These are inevitable roadblocks on the long journey of pursuing our goals. This will happen if we compete to win. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

As ""Game of Thrones"" comes to an end with its last season, we should all come away having learned a lesson from the Stark sisters. We don't know what the final season will bring for them, but we do know that both Arya and Sansa found a way to live with passion and perseverance in a brutally competitive environment. They remind us that even though the fairy tale may not last, we can choose to operate with grit and resilience in the face of adversity."
"Beagles force-fed pesticides, now released and up for adoption - CNN",edition.cnn.com,"Mimi Hsin Hsuan Sun, CNN",04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/pesticide-testing-beagles-released-and-up-for-adoption/index.html,"(CNN) Thirty-two beagles that were saved from an animal testing lab where they were force-fed pesticides are now ready for new homes -- and will likely have no trouble being adopted.
Just an hour after the Michigan Humane Society announced it was opening the adoption process for the dogs Friday evening, it received nearly 400 applications, spokesman Andy Bissonette said. Society staff are now reviewing the applications and plan to start contacting candidates Monday. The release of the dogs came after the Humane Society of the United States posted a video showing beagles being force-fed pesticides at Charles River Laboratories in Mattawan, Michigan. The organization said in its report on the testing that 36 beagles were part of a one-year pesticide study for a new fungicide developed by Corteva Agriscience, the agriculture division of DowDuPont. It said the dogs that made it to designated end of the study in July 2019 would be euthanized. Viral video led to dogs being released Read More Corteva came under fire after the video's release, and almost a week later it announced it would end testing on the dogs. On March 27, Corteva agreed to release the beagles to Michigan Humane Society, a partner of the national humane society. We fully appreciate your concern, and we're pleased we've reached an agreement with the Michigan Humane Society to rehome the animals. The dogs are healthy, and @mhumane has the experience, capability and capacity to rehome them. Please read our full update. pic.twitter.com/ao0n8zMOeM
— Corteva Agriscience™ (@corteva) March 27, 2019 The Michigan Humane Society said more than 100,000 people signed a petition on the Humane Society of the United States' website demanding that the dogs be released. Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, said they fought to have the beagles released to an adequate animal shelter. In an official statement , the Michigan Humane Society said, ""We are happy to announce that we have reached an agreement with Corteva Agriscience regarding the placement of the beagles from the study. We are pleased with their decision to work with us and look forward to a new beginning for each of these animals.""

— Michigan Humane Society (@mhumane) April 13, 2019 32 beagles are now up for adoption It is unclear why the Michigan organization received 32 beagles, while the testing involved 36. Kathleen Conlee, vice president of animal research issues at the Humane Society of the United States, said in a statement, ""We can't possibly know what kind of agreement Dow/Corteva had with Charles River but we do know that 36 dogs were ordered for the study."" She said that during their numerous conversations, company representatives never contradicted the 36 number. ""And, of course, we want to see all 36 beagles who were assigned to this study released to the Michigan Humane Society. It is up to Dow/Corteva to explain why there are only 32 dogs being released,"" she said."
GOP legislators slap restrictions on voter-approved Medicaid expansion - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,Tami Luhby,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/medicaid-expansion-states/index.html,"(CNN) Many residents in three deep-red states rejoiced last fall when voters approved Medicaid expansion, circumventing the objections of their elected representatives.
But the victories in Utah, Idaho and Nebraska -- which would have extended coverage to tens of thousands of residents in each state under the Obamacare provision -- have proven short-lived. This week, Idaho's GOP lawmakers and governor joined their peers in Utah and Nebraska in slapping work requirements and other restrictions on access to Medicaid. Idaho legislators had considered bills with less stringent measures, but ultimately rejected those. Medicaid expansion tied to fewer heart-related deaths, study finds ""We must encourage self-sufficiency among those receiving public assistance,"" Idaho Gov. Brad Little, a Republican, wrote to the president of the state Senate upon approving the bill. The moves demonstrate the enduring resistance among Republicans to adopting programs tied to the Affordable Care Act, even when voters themselves explicitly ask for them. Read More In all three states, certain Medicaid recipients, primarily working-age, non-disabled adults without dependents, will have to work or engage in other activities at least 20 hours a week to maintain their benefits. The repercussions of not doing so vary by state. In Idaho, enrollees are kicked off the program for at least two months. Nebraska's poor lose access to so-called prime coverage, which includes dental, vision and over-the-counter medication benefits. The states also made it more difficult for those just above poverty level to access Medicaid, even though Obamacare makes eligible those earning up to 138% of the poverty line, or about $12,500 for an individual. Utah is restricting coverage to those in poverty. In Nebraska, residents just over poverty must opt into Medicaid -- otherwise, they default into polices on the Obamacare exchanges, which are much pricier. Trump administration allows Utah to curtail voter-approved Medicaid expansion The states must still receive approval from the federal government, which recently lost a second court battle over work requirements in Kentucky and Arkansas. The Trump administration is appealing that decision. Advocates in all three states decried lawmakers' moves, saying they are ignoring the will of the people. Tens of thousands fewer people will gain coverage because of the restrictions. Also, work requirements will cost the states millions to administer. Judge strikes down Medicaid work requirements, again Recording the number of hours worked can be complicated, say opponents of work requirements. Some 18,000 people in Arkansas lost coverage last year, in part because they had a tough time with the online documentation system. Opponents are also skeptical that work mandates will help Medicaid enrollees become more independent. ""There's a reason why they aren't working,"" said state Rep. Ilana Rubel, an Idaho Democrat and House assistant minority leader. ""Layering on more punishment is very unlikely to produce the desired results."" "
Tiger Woods poised to strike as Francesco Molinari leads Masters - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Rob Hodgetts, CNN",04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/sport/masters-2019-molinari-woods-finau-round-three-spt-intl/index.html,"(CNN) If Saturday at the Masters was electric, Sunday could be supercharged.
The threat of severe thunderstorms has forced Augusta National officials to instigate a two-tee start in groups of three, with the leading trio of Francesco Molinari, Tiger Woods and Tony Finau off at 09:20 a.m. ET instead of in pairs mid afternoon. The hope is to get the fireworks wrapped up on the course before they come down from the sky. In Saturday's third round, if you weren't surging forwards you were going backwards. Four-time champion Woods parred his first four holes and was disappearing in the leaders' rear view mirror, but when he finally engaged gear at the seventh, he, too, roared up the leaderboard. A fifth birdie at the 16th sparked a tumultuous roar as he tied for the lead. Read More By the end of a sun-drenched, dazzling day of golf, Italy's British Open champion Molinari held a two-shot lead at 13 under over Woods and Finau going into the final round. Tiger Woods is bidding for a fifth Green Jacket at the Masters. 'Great test' Woods, of course, is trying to pull off a fairytale comeback with a fifth Green Jacket 14 years after his last, and a 15th major 11 years after his previous triumph. Inspired by his comeback season last year from spine fusion surgery, including second at the US PGA and culminating in a first victory for five years at the Tour Championship, Woods is rekindling memories of his heyday.

""That's part of the deal,"" he said. ""I'm playing for my fifth but I'm trying to win a golf tournament at the end of the day. I've just got to go out and execute.

READ: Tiger Woods' charge lights at Masters Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos The Masters, Augusta – The opening major of the golf season is the Masters from Augusta, Georgia every April. It's a spring rite, steeped in tradition and layered in rich sporting history and drama. It's an event that attracts even non-golfers because of the sublime beauty of the course. Click through the gallery for an A-Z of the Masters. Hide Caption 1 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos A is for Augusta National – The revered course has hosted the year's opening major -- and the only one of the big four events to be played at the same course every year -- since 1934. A is also for the azaleas which traditionally blossom during Masters week and for Amen Corner , the infamous stretch of holes incorporating the 11th, the treacherous short 12th and the tee shot on the par-five 13th. Hide Caption 2 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos B is for Beauty – The Georgian greensward is an oasis among the urban landscape of Augusta, Georgia's second city on the banks of the Savannah River. The bars, burger joints and shopping malls of neighboring Washington Road are in stark contrast to the golfing dreamscape over the fence. B is also for Seve Ballesteros, the Spaniard who opened the European floodgates with wins in 1980 and 1983. Hide Caption 3 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos C is for Caddies – Augusta's caddies are instantly recognizable by their white jump suits. Before 1983, players had to use a club caddie, all of whom were local black men. Since then players have used their usual tour caddies, but they must still don the white suit and green cap. Hide Caption 4 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos D is for Dos and Don'ts – The hallowed property is governed by its own strict rules such as no running or cell phones, but on the flip side traditions exist such as the practice of placing your green Masters chair at your preferred spot and being able to return to your vacant seat hours later. Hide Caption 5 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos E is for Eisenhower – Former US President Dwight D. Eisenhower was a member of Augusta National and several landmarks of his era remain, including Ike's Pond, the fishing lake he championed that is the focal point of the Par-3 Contest. Eisenhower's white cabin also sits near the clubhouse. Hide Caption 6 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos F is for Fans (make that Patrons) – Visitors to Augusta National are known as patrons -- not fans or spectators or the crowd. Tickets are like gold dust, but a limited number of practice round tickets and tournament days are available through a yearly ballot. The waiting list for weekly tournament badges closed years ago. Hide Caption 7 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos G is for Grand Slam – Rory McIlroy just needs the Masters to complete the Grand Slam of all four of golf's major titles. The Northern Irishman blew a four-shot lead at Augusta in 2011, but having won four majors in the meantime returns for his fifth shot at the Grand Slam this week. Only five others have achieved the feat -- Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. G is also for greens -- the slick, sloping putting surfaces are infamous. Hide Caption 8 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos H is for History – Augusta National was created by Scottish golf course architect Dr. Alister Mackenzie and co-founder Bobby Jones and opened in 1933 on land that was once the site of Fruitlands Nursery. During World War II the land was briefly given over to turkey and cattle farming. Hide Caption 9 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos I is for Internationals – South African Gary Player -- pictured here in 2014 with Jack Nicklaus (left) and the late Arnold Palmer -- was the first international champion in 1961.

It was first introduced for members in 1937 and ordered from Brooks Uniform Company in New York. Sam Snead was the first winner to receive a jacket and honorary membership in 1949. The reigning Masters champion can take it home for a year, then it must be kept at the club. Hide Caption 11 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos K is for Key holes – The saying goes the Masters doesn't begin until the back nine on Sunday. It starts with one of the hardest holes on the course in the 10th and then enters Amen Corner with the equally tough 11th and then the booby trap of the short 12th. But the long 15th (pictured) is key -- big moves can be made with eagles here. Anything less than a birdie and you will likely go backwards. Hide Caption 12 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos L is for Lane, as in Magnolia Lane – The exclusive driveway to Augusta's historic clubhouse is framed by dozens of magnolia trees. Only members and Masters competitors are allowed to access this revered entrance which gives on to the Founder's Circle and then the whitewashed concrete clubhouse, built in 1854. Hide Caption 13 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos M is for Mickelson – Popular left-hander Phil Mickelson is one of 17 players to have won multiple Masters titles. The three-time champion won the first of his five major titles at Augusta in 2004 after three straight third places. Even at 48, Mickelson remains a Masters threat. Hide Caption 14 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos N is for Nicklaus, as in Jack – The most successful player at the Masters is Jack Nicklaus, whose six Green Jackets remains the record. The 79-year-old is now an honorary starter along with Gary Player, following the death of four-time champion Arnold Palmer in 2016. Hide Caption 15 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos O is for Oak tree – The famous old oak tree on the course side of the clubhouse is an iconic landmark and the traditional meeting place for the game's movers and shakers and media types with the correct credential. A familiar refrain of Masters week is: ""Meet you under the tree."" Hide Caption 16 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos P is for Par 3s, notably the 12th – Perhaps the most famous short hole in golf, the par-3 12th sits at the heart of Amen Corner. Like a wolf in sheep's clothing, it is just 155 yards long, but Rae's Creek looms large in front and a devilish wind always swirling around the trees makes club selection tricky. Hide Caption 17 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos Q is for Quonset Hut – Modern media are housed in a recently built state-of-the-art facility at the far end of the practice range, but in days gone by the stories from Augusta were crafted in a corrugated metal Quonset Hut.

A Phil Mickelson roar stands out, but a roar for Tiger Woods is like no other. Hide Caption 19 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos S is for Spieth – Jordan Spieth was on a fast track to being crowned the new king of Augusta following his wire-to-wire victory in 2015 and dominance for three rounds in 2016. He was still clear with nine holes to play before famously self destructing with two balls in the water on 12. The American has struggled of late and is down to 33rd in the world, but in five Masters appearances he has won, finished second twice, come third and 11th. Hide Caption 20 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos T is for Tradition – The Masters is forward looking but rooted in tradition, such as the pre-tournament Par-3 Contest, in which friends and family members caddie for the players and hit the occasional shot. Jack Nicklaus' grandson Gary made a hole in one last year. Other traditions include the Champions Dinner, in which the holder chooses the menu and hosts the evening on the Tuesday of Masters week Hide Caption 21 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos U is for Under par – When Jordan Spieth won in 2015 he equaled Tiger Woods' 1997 record for the lowest winning score at 18 under par.

Hide Caption 23 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos W is for Woods – Who else? Tiger Woods changed golf when he won his first major by a record 12 shots in 1997. He went on to win three further Green Jackets, the last of which came in 2005 after a famous chip-in on the 16th. The 43-year-old is fit again after multiple back surgeries, and among the widely tipped contenders. Hide Caption 24 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos X is for X-factor – Winning the Masters requires a game in mint condition and a bit of something special. Think Tiger Woods' chip-in on the 16th in 2005, or Phil Mickelson's shot threaded through trees on the 13th in 2010. Or what about Bubba Watson's banana ball from the woods on the 10th to clinch a play off in 2012 (pictured)? Hide Caption 25 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos Y is for Youngest winner – Tiger Woods' 1997 win for the first of 14 majors so far made him the youngest Masters champion at the age of 21.

Phil Mickelson's jump for joy in 2004 at his 11th attempt kick started an era which yielded further victories in 2006 and 2010. Hide Caption 27 of 27 'Good fun' Off the course, the consensus is Woods has mellowed over the years and become more approachable after his injury woes and life struggles. Walking off the 18th following his impressive and at times fortunate 67 Saturday -- three times he drove into trees but escaped with a shot at the green -- he was all smiles and trading high and low fives with children and patrons lining the ropes. To pinpoint one thing that helps longevity at Augusta National it's putting. @TigerWoods was perfect today inside 10 feet.
Putting is about nerve & nerves. As long as Tiger has that under control, he can win at @TheMasters for next 10 yrs. Tiger's nerve is still pretty darn good!

Trump's pick for Fed seat Stephen Moore faces backlash 02:20 Warren, in her letter, pointed out that Moore was quick to criticize low interest rates when Barack Obama was president, but that he has since reversed that position as Trump has turned on the Fed's efforts to keep the economy in check as it absorbs the Republican tax cut and other expansionary measures backed by the President. She also specifically called out Moore's role in developing former Kansas Republican Gov. Sam Brownback's tax cuts, which triggered a budget crisis and which were ultimately reversed by Republican lawmakers . Read More Moore did not immediately respond to a message left for comment on Warren's letter. He has repeatedly defended himself against accusations that he's unqualified for the role, asserting in a CNN interview on Thursday that the central bank can be ""divorced from politics."" ""I have 35 years experience in the policy game. I was the youngest budget analyst in Washington at the age of 25. I was, served as Donald Trump's economic adviser. I'm very proud of what we accomplished. A lot of people said it would be impossible to make this agenda work,"" Moore told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront."" ""I think my qualifications stand up pretty well,"" he said. Moore also said he would not be the first member of the board with close ties to a sitting president, referencing former Chairman Ben Bernanke, who served as chief economist to President George W. Bush. ""I do believe in the importance of an independent Fed,"" said Moore, a former CNN analyst. ""I think it can be divorced from politics."" He added: ""It's not unusual for the president to take someone who agrees with a lot of his economic views."" Four Republican senators say they'd vote 'no' on Cain Warren's letter comes as Republican senators have turned on Trump's other Fed pick, former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain, whose candidacy was effectively ended in 2011 by allegations of sexual misconduct. Cain has steadfastly denied those allegations and this past weekend posted a video to Facebook again vowing to fight them . Four Republican senators said this week that they would vote no if he is nominated , leaving him no clear path to confirmation. Warren wrote a separate letter to Cain Friday, claiming he's had shifting views on monetary policy and raising concern about his pro-Trump super PAC. ""You have made comments regarding Federal Reserve policy that suggest an alarming lack of understanding of important aspects of the Federal Reserve's role and monetary policy,"" she wrote. Republicans have been warmer to Moore, though he also faces personal issues, including a tax lien of more than $75,000. ""The distinction's pretty clear. I know him. I know his philosophy, I know his economic positions, I know his credentials, I know his heart, and I think he'd be a good addition to the Fed. The issues that have been raised about Stephen, none of them disqualify him,"" North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer told CNN of Moore on Thursday. ""Those are sort of issues of life. Sexual harassment is quite different."" "
Cory Booker at Newark rally: 'We can't wait' for justice - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Rebecca Buck,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/cory-booker-kickoff-speech/index.html,"Newark, New Jersey (CNN) Sen. Cory Booker marked the start of a new phase in his campaign for president Saturday with his first major rally, set in the heart of the city where he got his start in politics as a councilman and then mayor.
Billed as his ""hometown kickoff,"" the event afforded Booker an opportunity to turn a page after a muted start to his bid in which the New Jersey Democrat has lagged in polling and fundraising behind half a dozen rivals. From a stage in Newark's Military Park, Booker imbued his core theme of ""justice for all"" with a fresh sense of urgency — invoking Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""Letter from a Birmingham Jail,"" written at this time in 1963, and its declaration that ""justice too long delayed is justice denied."" ""We are here today to say, we can't wait,"" Booker said. Booker also reiterated his commitment to running a positive campaign as President Donald Trump and others seek to ""make us fear each other, dislike each other, and hate each other."" Read More ""Critics will tell us that a campaign powered by grace and love and a deep faith in each other can't beat that,"" Booker said. ""But I say it's the only way we win."" 'Mayor Pete' surges into the top 10 in our 2020 rankings The rally kicks off a two-week national tour for Booker, which will take him next week to Iowa, Georgia and Nevada. But it is unclear whether it will jump-start his campaign, which has been slow to gather speed in the 10 weeks since his launch February 1. In a call with reporters this week, Booker's top campaign officials said they are pleased with how the campaign has played out thus far and don't believe they need a breakthrough moment at this stage; instead, they hope to methodically build up infrastructure and momentum to peak at the right moment. ""We're trying to win the election,"" Booker's campaign manager Addisu Demissie told reporters Thursday. ""We're not trying to win a news cycle."" But winning news cycles doesn't hurt, either, as ascendant South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg can attest — and Booker's campaign hoped a moment in the spotlight Saturday would help him to ""stay relevant in the conversation,"" as Demissie put it. The format Saturday played to Booker's considerable oratorical talents, which have consistently brought crowds to their feet during his campaign swings through the key early primary states. It was not a perfect show of strength, however, despite Booker's hometown advantage. The crowd, which ultimately numbered between 4,000 and 4,300, according to Newark police, was slow to arrive, and the program was delayed by roughly an hour. Booker tried to drum up excitement for the event on social media and in a series of local media appearances this week, touting the event's ""block party atmosphere,"" including food trucks and entertainment for children. ""We're doing the launch in our home,"" Booker said in one local radio interview. ""I don't know if there's ever been a presidential campaign launched from Brick City."" A Booker campaign aide, downplaying questions about turnout, said the event was ""meant to have a vibe of a hometown BBQ ... It's not meant to be a traditional 'rally.' "" But it bore all the markers of one — with patriotic bunting and the campaign's slogan, ""Justice For All,"" displayed prominently onstage and atop bleachers for the crowd. A massive American flag hung from a nearby building, and a marching band warmed up the crowd, along with a roster of state political figures including Gov. Phil Murphy and US Sen. Bob Menendez. Booker's campaign leadership said they viewed the event as an important ""framing moment"" for Booker to lay out his sweeping vision for the country and this election, following the initial flurry of announcements in the first quarter from a seemingly endless string of candidates. Indeed, those announcements are still coming: Buttigieg is expected to make it official in South Bend, Indiana, on Sunday after an exploratory phase, and former Vice President Joe Biden still waits in the wings. Unlike other candidates, however, Booker uncoupled his launch rally from his official campaign announcement, getting two bites of the apple 10 weeks apart. The Democratic electorate is older, more moderate and less educated than you think The event sought to showcase the full spectrum of Booker's appeal as he takes on a Democratic field chock full of intriguing contenders. The setting nodded not only to Booker's roots in Newark politics, but also to his home there today: As he often notes on the trail and did again Saturday, he is the only candidate who lives in an inner city neighborhood. He presented both of those facets of his biography as factors in his pragmatic approach to governance. ""A real progressive movement does not hold progress for communities like mine hostage today for promises that perfection will come tomorrow,"" Booker said. In attendance was Booker's older brother Cary, who will dip his toe into the 2020 waters with a trip to South Carolina next week, to speak to the Aiken County NAACP. Booker was introduced by his mother, Carolyn, who said, ""Cory will be the kind of president whose character makes us proud."""
Bernie Sanders pushes back at critics of his new wealth: 'I didn't know it was a crime to write a good book' - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Gregory Krieg,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/bernie-sanders-millionaire-book-sales-tax-returns/index.html,"Gary, Indiana (CNN) Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday rejected suggestions that his growing nest egg, mostly amassed from book sales following his 2016 campaign, undermines his political message.
""I didn't know that it was a crime to write a good book which turns out to be a bestseller,"" Sanders said at a community meeting in Gary, Indiana. Since Sanders described himself as a millionaire earlier this week, he and his campaign have stressed that his policy platform, which is fiercely critical of ""billionaires"" and wealthy corporate interests, like private insurers and pharmaceutical companies, is unchanged. His Medicare for All push has been colored by relentless attacks on those industries. ""My view has always been that we need a progressive tax system which demands that the wealthiest people in this country finally start paying their fair share of taxes. If I make a lot of money, you make a lot of money, that is what I believe,"" Sanders added, defiant and plainly frustrated by the line of questioning. ""So again, I don't apologize for writing a book that was number three on the New York Times best seller, translated into five or six languages and that's that."" Sanders' place among the frontrunners in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary has invited new scrutiny, most of it directed at his finances -- and his tax returns, which he said last week would be released by Tax Day, April 15. Sanders made his 2014 tax returns public during his first presidential campaign, in 2016. This time he's pledged to share a decade of records. Read More The Vermont independent has twice now bristled at questions about his personal wealth. His comment on Saturday echoed what he told the New York Times earlier this week. ""I wrote a best-selling book,"" Sanders said then. ""If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too."" Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir has also defended the candidate against claims that his increased income diminished his message or ability to deliver it, telling CNN on Wednesday that Sanders believes in ""opportunity for all."" ""The fact that he is somebody who has personally benefited from that opportunity is something that he feels should be a shared opportunity with everyone else,"" Shakir said. ""He's made some money off a book. And I think that the opportunity that he has had is evaporating for so many others. He feels that strongly ... There's nothing about any of these tax returns or the money or anything that'll come out that'll change that fundamental fact one bit."" Sanders' book, ""Our Revolution,"" was released in November 2016, a week after Donald Trump won the presidency. It claimed a spot on Times' bestseller list. The book is centered on his first campaign and the grassroots movement he worked to create while running against, and ultimately losing to, Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. His most recent book, ""Where We Go from Here: Two Years in the Resistance,"" was published in November 2018 and sets out the blueprint for his current run. Sanders entered the race in February."
"Beagles force-fed pesticides, now released and up for adoption - CNN",us.cnn.com,"Mimi Hsin Hsuan Sun, CNN",04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/pesticide-testing-beagles-released-and-up-for-adoption/index.html,"(CNN) Thirty-two beagles that were saved from an animal testing lab where they were force-fed pesticides are now ready for new homes -- and will likely have no trouble being adopted.
Just an hour after the Michigan Humane Society announced it was opening the adoption process for the dogs Friday evening, it received nearly 400 applications, spokesman Andy Bissonette said. Society staff are now reviewing the applications and plan to start contacting candidates Monday. The release of the dogs came after the Humane Society of the United States posted a video showing beagles being force-fed pesticides at Charles River Laboratories in Mattawan, Michigan. The organization said in its report on the testing that 36 beagles were part of a one-year pesticide study for a new fungicide developed by Corteva Agriscience, the agriculture division of DowDuPont. It said the dogs that made it to designated end of the study in July 2019 would be euthanized. Viral video led to dogs being released Read More Corteva came under fire after the video's release, and almost a week later it announced it would end testing on the dogs. On March 27, Corteva agreed to release the beagles to Michigan Humane Society, a partner of the national humane society. We fully appreciate your concern, and we're pleased we've reached an agreement with the Michigan Humane Society to rehome the animals. The dogs are healthy, and @mhumane has the experience, capability and capacity to rehome them. Please read our full update. pic.twitter.com/ao0n8zMOeM
— Corteva Agriscience™ (@corteva) March 27, 2019 The Michigan Humane Society said more than 100,000 people signed a petition on the Humane Society of the United States' website demanding that the dogs be released. Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, said they fought to have the beagles released to an adequate animal shelter. In an official statement , the Michigan Humane Society said, ""We are happy to announce that we have reached an agreement with Corteva Agriscience regarding the placement of the beagles from the study. We are pleased with their decision to work with us and look forward to a new beginning for each of these animals.""

Kathleen Conlee, vice president of animal research issues at the Humane Society of the United States, said in a statement, ""We can't possibly know what kind of agreement Dow/Corteva had with Charles River but we do know that 36 dogs were ordered for the study."" She said that during their numerous conversations, company representatives never contradicted the 36 number. ""And, of course, we want to see all 36 beagles who were assigned to this study released to the Michigan Humane Society. It is up to Dow/Corteva to explain why there are only 32 dogs being released,"" she said."
Police unleashed a barrage of deadly gunfire after they say a suspect fired a bullet that grazed a deputy's head - CNN,us.cnn.com,Theresa Waldrop and Shawn Nottingham,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/florida-carjacking-suspect-shot/index.html,"(CNN) A carjacking suspect in Florida was shot dead in a barrage of police gunfire Thursday after he fired a bullet that tore through a sheriff's deputy's hat and grazed his head, authorities said.
Phillip Thomas Marsh, 30, carjacked a woman's truck at gunpoint at a home Deltona, Florida, then led deputies on an extended chase, the Volusia County Sheriff's Office said in a news release . After hitting several tire-deflation devices, the truck slowed. Marsh got out and, holding a handgun, ran toward motorists stopped near him, the sheriff's office said. A deputy then drove an SUV in Marsh's direction, ""preventing him from reaching another potential carjacking victim,"" the sheriff's office said. Marsh then opened fire on deputies, grazing Sgt. Thomas Dane's hat and head, it said. Five deputies returned fire, hitting Marsh several times, the sheriff's office said. He was pronounced dead at an area hospital. Read More The suspect had been 'reported ... suicidal' The suspect had been ""reported missing and suicidal"" earlier in the week, the sheriff's office said. ""It was noted he was known to act violently toward law enforcement and has made threats of 'suicide by cop' and suicide by other means,"" the release said. ""Clearly, his actions, when he came out of that vehicle, he wanted us to shoot him, and he was going to take one of us with him,"" Sheriff Michael J. Chitwood told reporters. A seven-minute video posted at the sheriff's website shows the suspect exiting the truck, then running toward drivers stopped at the scene as he points a gun at his head. It then shows the deputy's SUV move toward Marsh, who can be seen running in the other direction, toward a wooded area, and firing his gun in the direction of the deputies, who then fire at him. Marsh fired three or four shots, Chitwood said, including the one that pierced Dane's hat and grazed his head. A ""millimeter lower, and Sgt. Dane is dead,"" said Chitwood, who described the day as his luckiest in 32 years of policing. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is conducting the official investigation into the shooting, the release states. Those who fired their weapons have been placed on administrative leave with pay, which is standard following a deputy-involved shooting."
"All-male Morehouse College to begin admitting transgender students in 2020, school says - CNN",us.cnn.com,Amir Vera,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/morehouse-college-transgender-policy/index.html,"Atlanta (CNN) Morehouse College, a historically black all-men's school in Atlanta, will begin admitting transgender students who identify as men in 2020, according to a news release from the school.
The new policy, known as the Gender Identity Admissions and Matriculation Policy , applies to all students who enroll in the private college by the fall 2020 semester. The announcement comes after Spelman College, a private historically black all-women's school in Atlanta, adopted a similar policy in 2017. ""In a rapidly changing world that includes a better understanding of gender identity, we're proud to expand our admissions policy to consider trans men who want to be part of an institution that has produced some of the greatest leaders in social justice, politics, business, and the arts for more than 150 years,"" said Terrance Dixon, Morehouse vice president for enrollment management. ""The ratification of this policy affirms the College's commitment to develop men with disciplined minds who will lead lives of leadership and service."" Policy only allows for trans men to be admitted Read More The policy was developed after 15 months of community engagement with faculty, staff, students and alumni, the release says. Morehouse President David A. Thomas created a task force that led the community engagement meetings. ""Morehouse College has been at the forefront of human rights issues for 152 years,"" Thomas said in a statement to CNN. ""Today's vote to reaffirm our dedication to educating and developing men, including trans men, is an important step into one of the new frontiers of social justice — gender identity."" The policy also states that students who are admitted into Morehouse ""are expected to self-identify as men throughout their education at Morehouse,"" the release states. Should a student transition from a man to a woman, the student would no longer be eligible to enroll at the school, the release states. Trans women, or any person who identifies as a woman, will not be considered for admission into the school, the release says. Morehouse spokeswoman Aileen Dodd said students who identified as trans women before 2020 are eligible to graduate from Morehouse, but are not permitted to graduate from the school after 2020. A trans woman is a person who was born a man but transitioned to become a woman. There will be a system in place to consider exemptions to the rule, with the Morehouse president having the final say, the release says. Other historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) that have nondiscrimination policies addressing gender identity include Tuskegee University in Alabama, Howard University in Washington, Florida A&M University, Southern University and A&M College in Louisiana, North Carolina Central University and Morgan State University in Maryland. Students, alumni react to new policy There were differing views on the announcement. Titi Naomi Tukes, who graduated from Morehouse in 2017, is not a fan of the new policy. ""I unequivocally disapprove of it because it is exclusionary of trans women or gender non-conforming and non-binary students,"" said Tukes, who uses the pronouns they, them and theirs. Tukes said when students go to college they usually don't know themselves and, over the course of their college career, can question their religion, sexuality or gender. ""In this case the college would expel students for something they have no control over,"" Tukes said. They added that the new policy will ""embolden faculty, staff and administrators who already target and discriminate against transgender women and non-binary students."" Tatiana Rafael is one such student. A senior sociology major, Rafael identifies as a transsexual woman who began transitioning six months after she began attending Morehouse in 2017. ""Morehouse is missing a chance to be progressive and inclusive in that way,"" Rafael said. She admits she doesn't feel welcome at Morehouse. ""I felt pretty marginalized and erased. I was never included in the image of the school. I was kind of just there by default,"" she said, adding she feels there's no place for a trans woman in the image of Morehouse. Rafael did say, however, she sees the benefit of the new policy and what it can do for trans men. ""I think for trans men, it's going to be a great experience because they now have opportunity to attend one of the top schools for black men,"" she said. Robert Brown, an alumnus who graduated in 1996, said he's excited to see the evolution of the policy. ""When I was at Morehouse it was much more homophobic and much more transphobic,"" he said. ""It's great to see the school embrace a broader spectrum of students."" Brown said there's always been an LGBTQ population at Morehouse, but this new policy is taking ""important steps to enfranchising this population, rather than pretending they don't exist."" Morehouse, which has an enrollment of 2,202, instituted a policy in 2009 banning its male students from wearing women's clothes, makeup or high heels in what was called the ""Appropriate Attire Policy."" The move was in response to five gay students who, said a school official at the time, weren't dressing the way Morehouse men are expected to dress. In 2013, according to the school's newspaper The Maroon Tiger, Morehouse began offering a course on black LGBTQ history and culture."

"Tornado touches down in Franklin, Texas, as severe storm system threatens Southeast - CNN",us.cnn.com,Allie Mazurek and Judson Jones,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/tornado-texas-southeast-storms-wxc/index.html,"(CNN) Storms hammered east Texas on Saturday, with two children killed when a tree fell on a car, authorities said.
The children, ages 3 and 8, were in the back seat with their parents in the front when the tree fell on their vehicle around 3 p.m., said Angelina County Sheriff's Department Captain Alton Lenderman. The children were pronounced dead at the scene. A preliminary damage survey found that a tornado with peak intensity of EF-3 and winds up to 140 mph touched down in Robertson County, according to a tweet from the National Weather Service in Forth Worth. There were reports of multiple injuries in the Robertson County town of Franklin, the NWS said, and CNN affiliate KWTX reported widespread damage there. Trees were pulled up by the roots, roofs torn off buildings, and the cinder block foundation was all that was left of a mobile home in the town, which is southeast of Waco. The entire town of Franklin and neighboring Bremond lost electricity, with power expected to be restored Saturday night. Read More To the north, dime-sized hail pounded the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Texas is seeing the beginning of the dangerous and severe storms forecast to slam parts of the Southeast and Ohio River Valley this weekend. The powerful system will create the potential for life-threatening winds, strong tornadoes and large hail. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a moderate risk (level 4 out of 5) for severe weather Saturday across parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley. And Sunday, an enhanced risk (level 3 out of 5) stretches from Atlanta to Cleveland. 4 tornado safety tips that could save your life Severe storms possible from Texas to Mississippi Track the storms with CNN's storm tracker CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said the warm air present during the afternoon enhanced the atmosphere's instability, creating more energy for storms to tap into and aiding in their development. He said the threat for severe weather is greatest at such times. The storms most capable of producing tornadoes and large hail will be the individual, rotating cells that form ahead of a larger complex of thunderstorms. Tornadoes possible overnight in Alabama By late Saturday, the storms were expected to organize into a line as they cross the western border of Mississippi. The system will begin to move through Alabama overnight and is expected to reach Georgia by Sunday morning. The energy from warm afternoon temperatures will diminish, but the risk for tornadoes will not be over. ""The storm is so vigorous that tornadoes are still possible after dark,"" Myers said. Tornadoes at that time can be especially dangerous since they are difficult to see and people are less likely to receive warnings while they're asleep. Georgia, the southern Appalachians and Ohio Valley The most significant risk of severe weather is expected Saturday, but there's still considerable potential Sunday. The Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk across a broad area, stretching from eastern Alabama through the southern Appalachians and into the Ohio Valley. The main line of storms will begin to push into this area late Sunday morning and trek to the east on Sunday afternoon. The center said it expects the threat of severe weather to increase throughout the afternoon. ""Damaging winds appear to be the greatest threat on Sunday, but tornadoes will also be possible,"" CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. The risk will slowly diminish as the system begins to weaken Sunday evening. Sunday tee times moved up at The Masters Georgia's Augusta National Golf Club is included in the slight risk area Sunday as the Masters golf tournament concludes. Tournament organizers have moved up tee times for Sunday because of the storm threat. The storms are expected to move through the Augusta area during the afternoon and evening. The tornado threat will be lower by then, but damaging winds could still present hazardous conditions."

And that's not all. The fossils of a previously unknown human relative were discovered in a cave. Scientists found an exoplanet and considered how life might thrive on other exoplanets. Declassified U2 spy plane images revealed archeological features lost to time. And unfortunately, a mission to the moon ended by crashing into it. Here's everything you might have missed this week in the world of space and science news. Einstein was right (again) Read More On Wednesday, the world was introduced to the first photo of a black hole . And then a million memes erupted, tagging such phenomena as the eye of Sauron from ""Lord of the Rings"" and suggesting cats as the real cause. The supermassive black hole resides at the center of the galaxy M87, 55 million light-years from us. It's now been named Powehi , a Hawaiian phrase referring to an ""embellished dark source of unending creation."" Scientists used a global network of eight telescopes called the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration that effectively created an Earth-size telescope. In the image, a central dark region is encapsulated by a ring of light that looks brighter on one side. The first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole.

— MIT CSAIL (@MIT_CSAIL) April 10, 2019 After great triumph comes failure The first privately funded mission to the moon, Israel's Beresheet spacecraft, was attempting to perform a soft landing on the moon when it crashed Thursday. Israeli spacecraft crashes in final moments before moon landing ""I am sorry to say that our spacecraft did not make it in one piece to the moon,"" said Opher Doron, the manager of Israel Aerospace Industries' Space Division. ""We made it all the way to the moon. This is a great accomplishment. We are the seventh country to make it all the way to the moon."" The mission launched in February with great fanfare. The failure is believed to be due to a communication issue. What happens when you spend a year in space? In case you were wondering, a lot. Spending 340 days aboard the International Space Station between 2015 and 2016 caused changes in astronaut Scott Kelly's body, from his weight down to his genes, according to the results of the NASA Twins Study, released Thursday. The majority of changes in Kelly's body, compared with his identical brother, Mark, on Earth, returned to normal once he came back from the space station. The study results suggest that human health can be ""mostly sustained"" for a year in space, the researchers said. But the much-anticipated study reveals areas that may require countermeasures or safeguards when preparing for longer space missions or missions to deep space, like Mars. Human health can be 'mostly sustained' for a year in space, NASA Twins Study concludes A year in space caused Scott's carotid artery to thicken, damage to his DNA, changes in gene expression, a thickening of the retina, shifts in gut microbes, reduced cognitive abilities and a structural change at the ends of chromosomes, called telomeres. But it did not alter or mutate his DNA. Getting a flu shot in space also worked exactly as it did on Earth. Nutrition and exercise on the station caused weight loss and an increase in folic acid that caused the vital production of red blood cells. The findings have health implications not only for astronauts who may endure longterm missions to Mars and elsewhere but for those of us here on Earth who aren't considering going off-planet. Cancer patients also undergo genetic changes and radiation exposure. This study shows how a healthy body responds and adapts to stress, which could separate out how the body responds to other stressors, cancer or infections. Meet Homo luzonensis Together, 13 bones found in Callao Cave in the Philippines represent our only knowledge of a newly discovered species related to humans called Homo luzonensis. The fossils belonged to two adults and one child who lived between 50,000 and 67,000 years ago. This time frame means luzonensis would have lived at the same time as Neanderthals, Denisovans, Homo sapiens and the small-bodied Homo floresiensis. Like other extinct hominins, luzonensis is more of a close relative than a direct ancestor. A mysterious species related to humans has been discovered No DNA was extracted from the hand and foot bones or teeth, but the fossils contain an intriguing mix of archaic and progressive traits that can be traced to Homo sapiens as well as Australopithecus afarensis. Australopithecus lived between 2.9 million and 3.9 million years ago. More research is on the horizon, and then we may have a better idea of what they looked like and how they lived. Spy planes: The new archaeological tool Time, weather and human interference tend to erase important markers of the past. But enterprising scientists were able to get their hands on images captured by U2 spy planes that are now declassified and public. In the 1950s and '60s, the planes flew over the Middle East, Europe and parts of Asia to take photos of military targets. But the cameras kept taking photos in between targets, recording desert, fields and villages. Researchers went through thousands of frames. What they found were archaeological features that can no longer be seen, including prehistoric hunting traps, 3,000-year-old canals and 60-year-old marsh villages that disappeared when they were drained. The hunting traps, called desert kites, were stone structures between 5,000 to 8,000 years old that trapped gazelles and other animals. One of the U2 spy plane photos used to show evidence of hunting traps. The images also provide a look at Aleppo before the Syrian civil war destroyed so much of it, the researchers said. This is the first time U2 spy plane imagery has been used archaeologically, but the researchers are hoping it's just the beginning now that the resources are available to all. Life could be on these exoplanets A team of Brazilian astronomers found evidence of an exoplanet that orbited a binary, or two-star system, in which one of the stars is dead. The giant exoplanet also happens to have the mass nearly 13 times that of Jupiter. So it wouldn't be the best place to set up shop. There's been a lot of scientific excitement in recent years about rocky Earth-like planets orbiting small red dwarf stars close to our solar system. The planets found around these stars have been within the habitable zone, where liquid water could exist on the surface of the planets and life could potentially exist. But then that excitement was squished by radiation. These planets also happen to be close to their stars, and even though the stars are small, they have a nasty habit of flaring and basically lashing their planets with big doses of radiation. That doesn't exactly sound friendly to life or an atmosphere. But this week, researchers reminded us that Earth went through a similar phase, and hey, we're still here. Early on in Earth's history, life had to withstand heavy UV radiation. This could be happening on Proxima-b , TRAPPIST-1e , Ross 128 b and LHS 1140b . ""Given that the early Earth was inhabited,"" the researchers wrote, ""we show that UV radiation should not be a limiting factor for the habitability of planets orbiting [small red dwarf] stars. Our closest neighboring worlds remain intriguing targets for the search for life beyond our solar system."""
A US Navy sailor and a Japanese woman have been found dead with knife wounds in Okinawa,us.cnn.com,Yoko Wakatsuki and Kevin Bohn,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/world/navy-sailor-japanese-woman-dead-okinawa-apartment/index.html,"(CNN) A US Navy sailor and a Japanese woman were found dead -- both stabbed -- on Saturday in a bloody apartment bedroom on the Japanese island of Okinawa, police there said.
Both bodies have knife wounds, and investigators believe these were the cause of death, police said. A minor was found unharmed in the apartment and is being taken care of by authorities, Okinawa police said. The incident appeared to be a homicide-suicide, with the sailor having killed the woman, Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Takeo Akiba said in a statement. Police did not immediately comment on a perpetrator or release any names. The sailor was attached to the US 3rd Marine Division, which has a base in Okinawa. US Marine Corps leaders said they were aware of the deaths and will support the ongoing investigation. Read More ""This is an absolute tragedy and we are fully committed to supporting the investigation into the incident,"" the III Marine Expeditionary Force said in a statement.

The US ambassador to Japan, William Hagerty, expressed deep regret and promised full cooperation with the investigation, according to a statement released Saturday by US embassy."
McGill University sports teams drop 'Redmen' name amid criticism,us.cnn.com,Nicole Chavez,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/americas/mcgill-university-redmen-name/index.html,"(CNN) McGill University will no longer use the name Redmen for its men's varsity sports teams after students argued the term was a racial slur.
Suzanne Fortier, the school's principal and vice-chancellor, announced her decision Friday, saying the name made indigenous students feel alienated. ""They feel disrespected and unconsidered. They feel conflicted over their rightful pride in being Indigenous people, and their pride in being McGill students,"" Fortier said in a statement. ""This tension is even stronger for Indigenous student-athletes."" Fortier noted the university in Montreal had not adopted the name as a reference to North American indigenous peoples but said that perceptions have since then changed. ""McGill did not adopt the Redmen name as a reference to North American Indigenous peoples. However, the name has been associated with Indigenous peoples at different points in our history. Today, 'Redmen' is widely acknowledged as an offensive term for Indigenous peoples, as evidenced by major English dictionaries,"" the principal said. Read More ""While this derogatory meaning of the word does not reflect the beliefs of generations of McGill athletes who have proudly competed wearing the University's colours, we cannot ignore this contemporary understanding. Intention, however benign, does not negate prejudicial effect."" Fortier said the change is effective immediately and the teams will be be known as only ""McGill"" for the upcoming athletic season. The school said the decision does not affect the women's teams, which are called the Martlets. The name is a reference to a mythical bird that cannot land because it has no feet. The school has used the name Redmen since the late 1920s and it was originally a reference to the red uniforms worn by the sports team, according to the school's website. The reference to indigenous people began in the 1950s when the school adopted a logo depicting an indigenous man wearing a headdress. All signage, banners, flags, clothing and other branded items on campus are expected to be removed by the fall semester. However, the Redmen name will remain in the school's sports hall of fame and ""on existing items of historical significance"" such as trophies and championship photos, the school said . The school is expected to pick a new name that ""everyone can wear, and cheer for, with pride"" for the 2020-2021 season, Fortier said. American sports teams have recently faced similar criticism due to their names and logos. Last year, the MLB's Cleveland Indians parted ways with their Chief Wahoo logo and removed the Native American caricature this season from the team's jerseys. The team had used the image far less frequently for a few years and adopted a ""C"" as its main logo. In 2001, Colgate University in New York state changed the name of their sports teams from the Red Raiders to just ""Raiders"" to move away from what it said was a racial stereotype. The name was coined as a reference to the maroon color of the football team's jerseys and not to Native Americans, but the school said it could still be seen as offensive. Native American groups and some politicians, including former President Barack Obama, have pressured the NFL's Washington Redskins to consider a name change but its owner, Daniel Snyder, has insisted the name its not offensive to Native Americans."
Writers Guild of America calls for mass firings of agents,us.cnn.com,Brian Stelter,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/media/writers-guild-agents-hollywood/index.html,"(CNN) Hollywood's biggest labor battle in a decade is officially underway. The issue, as is usually the case, is money.
The Writers Guild of America is taking action against the industry's biggest talent agencies. A bevy of writers who are members of the guild have broken off ties with the agents who usually represent them. The guild has 15,000 members, so the action could have sweeping consequences. This mass firing of agents has never happened before, so no one quite knows what's going to happen or how long it's going to last. The two sides had been holding contentious negotiations until Friday, when the writers had set a deadline for talent agencies to accept its new ""code of conduct."" A few hours before the deadline, the guild told its members that talks had failed, so it was time to cut ties with the agents. Read More The Association of Talent Agents said Friday night that the writers guild wants ""chaos"" that ""will hurt all artists."" Here's who made Hollywood Reporter's list of most powerful figures in New York media But the guild said the agents have not adequately addressed ""our expressed concerns"" about packaging fees and other issues. Here is how the writers guild frames the issues: ""Our agents work for us. Every dollar they make must be generated as a percentage of the money we make. That is what it means to be our representatives and our fiduciaries. Agency-based studios and packaging fees make a mockery of that and are in violation of the agencies' ethical and legal obligations to writers."" Packaging fees are lucrative payments that agencies receive for putting together multiple clients -- say, a writer and a director and an actor -- as a ""package"" for a TV studio. The National Enquirer is for sale The writers guild says it wants to ""realign agency incentives so they are consistent with, rather than competing with, the interests of writer clients."" Thus, the new ""code of conduct."" One of the guild's slogans has been ""clients over conflicts."" Screenwriter John August, who wrote films like ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""Big Fish,"" tweeted , ""My agent of 20+ years is a great friend and fighter for my career. I would give him a kidney tomorrow. But this isn't about him or any single agent. Until agencies put #ClientsOverConflicts we can't work together. Simple as that."" Famous Hollywood names like Damon Lindelof, Hart Hanson and David Simon have posted their agent termination letters on social media. The four big talent agencies in the US are WME, CAA, UTA and ICM. They, and other smaller agencies, are represented by the Association of Talent Agents. Karen Stuart, the association's executive director, said in a statement that the ""code of conduct"" will ""hurt all artists, delivering an especially painful blow to mid-level and emerging writers, while dictating how agencies of all sizes should function."" Stuart said ""we came to the negotiating table in good faith and put forth comprehensive proposals,"" but the guild ""refused to negotiate further."" ""We're prepared to continue to fight for the best interests of writers and all artists,"" she added. There is no indication that further talks are scheduled right now."
Bed Bath & Beyond to close 40 stores,us.cnn.com,Jackie Wattles,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/business/bed-bath-and-beyond-stores-closing/index.html," Bed Bath & Beyond is struggling , and its turnaround plan includes shutting down about 40 locations this year and testing new ideas with ""lab"" stores that sell more home decor and food products.
Executives said this week that the company's sales are still declining and it lost money last quarter. It expects to shutter more than 40 stores if the company cannot negotiate better lease terms at some locations — but the company also has plans to open 15 new locations. The company has 1024 stores in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico. CEO Steven Temares told investors during an earning call earlier this week that Bed Bath & Beyond started experimenting with 21 ""next-generation lab stores"" last year, and they've fared better than other locations. The lab stores have ""a greater emphasis on home decor, food and beverage, and health and beauty care,"" Temares said, and different layouts that aim to give shoppers better views of the merchandise. Activist investors want to clean house at Bed Bath and Beyond Sales in the experimental stores were 2.2% higher than comparable Bed Bath & Beyond ( BBBY ) stores over the past four weeks, Temares said on Wednesday. Customers spent more, and the company earned higher margins. Read More It plans to bring what it learns at those stores to locations across the country. The home goods chain has struggled to compete with traditional retailers such as Walmart ( WMT ) and Target ( TGT ) , as well as online retailers Amazon ( AMZN ) ad discounters like TJ Maxx and its HomeGoods arm. Last month, three activist funds said they have built a roughly 5% stake in Bed Bath & Beyond. They said they would attempt to overhaul the company's management team. On Wednesday, Bed Bath & Beyond said it would nominate a new lead director to its board and revamp its corporate governance structure. It plans to announce additional changes to the board in the future. The group wants Bed Bath & Beyond to trim its product selection and beef up the in-store experience to drive traffic back to stores. They're also pressuring the company to improve margins by selling more of its own products."

Backstreet Boys hit 'I Want It That Way' is 20 years old,us.cnn.com,Harmeet Kaur,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/entertainment/backstreet-boys-i-want-it-that-way-20-years-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The Backstreet Boys have been 'wanting it that way' for two decades now.
The iconic hit song ""I Want It That Way"" was released 20 years ago Friday, and it's still unclear what exactly Nick, Howie, AJ, Brian and Kevin wanted and what way they wanted it. The boy band revisited the age-old question in a video on Twitter, posing several theories as to what ""it"" could be. 20 years of ""I Want It That Way"" have really flown by! Thank you all for your support since the release in 1999. It really means the world to us and we released a little special edition of the video for its anniversary. ❤️🙏🏻 #IWantItThatWay20 https://t.co/t51oYSIE2t pic.twitter.com/jhEFqCLOyk
— Backstreet Boys (@backstreetboys) April 12, 2019 Let's go through them, shall we? Theory 1: Burger King Read More Remember that time when you could get a Backstreet Boys CD with your Burger King value meal? Or how you'd buy a kids' meal just to get one of these action figures ? Yeah, 2000 was weird. So let's look at the facts. Burger King did go by the slogan ""Have It Your Way"" until 2014, meaning the boys would indeed have gotten it ""that way"" -- whatever ""that"" is. But the song came out a year before their partnership with the burger chain, so we're betting that's not it. Theory 2: The fans Yes, fans still go wild for the Backstreet Boys, if the nostalgia for the 20th anniversary of ""I Want It That Way"" is any indication. And it's possible that the boys appreciated their fans so much that they dedicated the first verse of their song to them, calling them ""my fire"" and ""the one desire."" But you don't have to look past the chorus before this one falls apart too. Why would they say their fans ""ain't nothing but a heartache"" or ""ain't nothing but a mistake?"" Theory 3: The song itself The song was reportedly recorded with different lyrics at first, so it's possible that the boys liked the original lyrics better. Andreas Carlsson, a Swedish hitmaker who wrote the lyrics along with Max Martin, talked to music website HitQuarters about the ordeal back in 2009: ""'I Want It That Way' was a play with words,"" he said. ""When Max came up with the original idea for the song, it already had the line 'You are my fire, the one desire.' We tried a million different variations on the second verse, and finally we had to go back to what was sounding so great, 'You are my fire, the one desire.' And then we changed it to 'Am I your fire, your one desire,' which made absolutely no sense in combination with the chorus -- but everybody loved it!"" So maybe there was never meant to be an answer? Backstreet Boys try to explain themselves Still, Chrissy Teigen nobly went in search of the truth last year. ""'I never wanna hear you say, ""I want it that way"" cause i want it that way'. He doesn't wanna hear it because he is the one that wants it that way? He wants to be the one to say it? Also what is 'it'?"" the Sports Illustrated swimsuit model asked on Twitter. The Backstreet Boys responded in their typically elusive fashion. Don't wanna hear you say that you want heartaches and mistakes... or to be 2 worlds apart. We don't want you to want ""it"" that way - that's the way we want it... for you to not want it that way. pic.twitter.com/z7YWFhH8t1

Ariana Grande's Coachella performance shouldn't be compared to Beyoncé's,us.cnn.com,Sandra Gonzalez,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/entertainment/ariana-grande-coachella/index.html,"(CNN) Last year on the Coachella stage, Beyoncé, the first woman of color to headline the iconic festival, gave a two-hour performance of a lifetime , complete with a marching band and a Destiny's Child reunion. It was so incredible, there's even going to be a Netflix documentary about it.
This weekend, Ariana Grande will become the youngest artist to ever headline the festival. She's also only the fourth woman to do so. Comparisons to her fellow female headliners -- and to Beyoncé in particular -- will be inevitable. But let's hope not. Look, comparisons can be fun. They're cause for friendly debate, make for clickable blog posts and are easy fodder for online polls. But doing so minimizes the unique contributions of each of these strong women. They represent a trope that has proven as unkillable as some cheesy horror movie villain: that successful women are incapable of supporting and sharing a space with other successful women. ""Beyoncé is incredible and so is Ariana Grande,"" says Enongo Lumumba-Kasongo, a Philadelphia-based rapper best known as Sammus. ""So I hope that folks will be smart enough to not buy into [comparisons]."" Read More Even in this sisterhood-forward culture, there are still corners of society that have yet to get the memo that women don't like and don't want to be pit against each other. Fanning the flames It happened to Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera because they were both pretty, belly-baring girls who went from Disney child stars to pop stars vying for ""TRL"" votes in the late '90s and early '00s. It happened to Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood because they both faced the critiques of Simon Cowell at the start of their careers. And continues to happen to others. Back in the day, Aguilera and Spears tried to stomp out the feud rumors. Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards ""It's really sad to see that some tabloid magazines still have to manufacture ill will between Britney and me,"" Aguilera said in a post on her website in 2005. ""If certain journalists want to throw their integrity out the window by spreading false information, then so be it. But I'm not falling for their lies and neither should my fans or Britney's."" Still, one tabloid blazed on its cover, ""Britney vs Christina: Why they're still trying to be the sexiest!"" This was in 2011. Times are changing. Last year, country singer Kelsea Ballerini lambasted an online poll that asked people to vote for the female artist they were most looking forward to seeing perform at an award show, saying the ""simple and seemingly harmless"" question actually does female artists a disservice. ""It makes us feel like there's only one spot available,"" she said in a lengthy Instagram post. ""This isn't 'Mean Girls,' this is country music. Where you actually CAN sit with us."" With her statement, Ballerini also hit on an idea that women everywhere are increasingly subscribing to: You don't have to cutdown one women in order to compliment another. Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood at an event in 2018 Clarkson and Underwood similarly stood their ground when a Twitter poll asked which former ""American Idol"" winner was ""most iconic."" ""I think we're both winning in life and pretty blessed,"" Clarkson said on Twitter. Underwood added: ""I do wish more publications would just celebrate women's success without pitting them against each other...Just my thoughts."" Not all feuds are inventions of the media or fueled by fans . Take, for instance, the seemingly real animosity between Cardi B and Nicki Minaj, which came to blows at a New York Fashion Week party last year . Before the women made peace , the exploitation of their conflict didn't sit well with writer El Hunt at NME , who wrote, ""when we see high-profile 'beef' unfolding between female stars, the most common cause, we're told, must be envy."" ""While their male counterparts trade blows and quips as part of a wider tradition, we're told that women bitch about one another, and get into petty scraps,"" she wrote. ""We decide they must just hate each other, and look on with glee to see who will triumph."" In the hip-hop genre, Lumumba-Kasongo, who is also a PhD student at Cornell, says healthy competition can ""drive innovation in the art form."" However, when female hip-hop artists are seen as competitive or possess a healthy ego about their skills, ""it's always framed as kind of cattiness."" Different stakes Male artists get compared to one another, too -- as boy bands and every ""white guy with a guitar"" who's ever competed on ""American Idol"" can attest. But the challenges facing male artists are vastly different than those facing women in the music industry. Male musicians aren't being told to ""step up"" so they can have the honor of being recognized by their industry. Their magazine profiles don't start with descriptions of their bodies and go on to demean their peers. They're not looking at festival lineups and noticing a stark imbalance . ""This idea that only one woman can exist in a space is something that's institutionalized,"" Lumumba-Kasongo says. ""We wouldn't have this pitting of women against each other if there were multitudes of slots for women to be parts of these spaces."" If women had equal representation at, for example, festivals, she says, the tendency to make female artists feel like they're vying for a precious few slots ""wouldn't become an automatic part of the conversation."" ""It's continuously, 'well, we've got our women artists, so check .' So, of course, every year, whoever is in that position is going to be compared to the person who was in that position the year prior,"" she said. Lumumba-Kasongo, who will release a new album later this year, says she finds social media and general camaraderie to be a useful tools in fighting false narratives about her and her fellow female artists. ""[It] might not work in a way that's easy to quantify, but I do feel like it pushes the culture forward when people see, you know, an Ariana Grande and a Nicki Minaj hanging out or Beyoncé and a Rihanna being in the same area,"" she says. ""That changes the conversation."" BEYONCE
— Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) February 4, 2013 Grande and Beyoncé seem to share admiration for each other. Grande pointed to Destiny's Child as a musical inspiration in a V magazine article in 2014, saying ""That's where I discovered my range. I grew up listening to Destiny's Child. I would try so hard to mimic all Beyoncé's little runs and ad-lib things. They are so precise. It's like math....Thank you, Destiny's Child!"" Beyoncé, meanwhile, once included Grande on a curated playlist in honor of her own birthday, comprised of what Queen B called ""some of the great musical talents born in the month of June."" Accomplished in her own right, Grande is Billboard's Woman of the Year and notched her fourth No. 1 album in February, but it didn't take long for a competition between the two to be teed up when she was announced as the 2019 headliner for Coachella. There's no denying that on stage last year, Beyoncé gave a spectacle of sound, a layered masterclass on black culture and a show that some will say cannot possibly be topped in our lifetimes. The beauty is, whatever Grande decides to do when she takes the stage at Coachella will be a creation all her own, truly comparable only against her other performances. It's past time for a notable change in how women are written and talked about as performers. Enough with fostering animosity between powerful, successful women. It leaves a bitter taste -- you know, something akin to lemonade without sweetener."
Amritsar massacre: India demands full apology from Britain - CNN,www.cnn.com,"Sandi Sidhu, Sugam Pokharel",04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/13/india/amritsar-massacre-100-years-intl-gbr/index.html,"(CNN) Hundreds have gathered in the northern Indian city of Amritsar to mark the centenary of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre where British troops killed hundreds of men, women and children.
On April 13, 1919, British troops fired without warning on a peaceful protest of thousands of unarmed Indians in Amritsar, Punjab, in what became alternately known as the Amritsar or the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. While the number of those killed is disputed between British and Indian authorities, a report by a British-led committee following the massacre put the number of victims at close to 400, with three to four times as many people injured. Indian observers said more than 1,000 people lost their lives.

Raising an intersex child: 'This is your body. ... There's nothing to be ashamed of',us.cnn.com,"Daniella Emanuel, CNN",04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/health/intersex-child-parenting-eprise/index.html,"(CNN) When Stephani Lohman got her first look at her newborn in the delivery room, she playfully hit her husband, Eric, on the arm. She made a flustered comment about how ultrasounds could get the sex of the child wrong.
The doctors in the Ontario hospital were silent. Eric knew that the situation was more serious than a mixup. ""I sort of looked around at that moment, and I saw what I would describe as panic on all of the medical staff's faces,"" Eric said. Stephani Lohman with Rosie in August 2012. They had expected their baby, Rosie, to be a girl, but her parents saw what seemed to be a penis. Eric remembered learning when he was getting his doctorate about babies born with genitalia that wasn't typically male or female. He realized right away that Rosie was like those babies. ""I wanted the baby to be put on my chest right away, because I just had her, and I worked really hard for that moment, and they didn't,"" Stephani said, recalling that day in 2012. ""And I was scared."" Read More The doctors covered Rosie with a blanket and took her across the room for what seemed like a long time, Eric said. When they returned, they offered what they knew: Rosie had atypical genitalia, and more tests were needed to determine whether she was genetically a girl or a boy and if she had a serious medical condition, Eric said the doctors told them. ""It basically went from very celebratory, very exciting, to very scary,"" Eric said. Eric Lohman holds Rosie in the hospital in August 2012. The next few days were filled with extensive tests and examinations until the doctors were finally able to make a diagnosis. Rosie had two X chromosomes, and so was considered to be female, they said, but she had salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a severe form of a condition called CAH for short. People with CAH are missing an enzyme that the adrenal glands need to produce cortisol. Rosie's body is unable to retain enough sodium. The adrenal glands also produce the initial ingredients of sex hormones, so when the brain gets signals that cortisol levels are low, it demands that the adrenal glands work harder. That leads to a higher production of sex hormone ingredients, which results in an excess of male hormones. Those hormones are what cause the formation of atypical genitalia in fetuses with two X chromosomes while they're in utero. Rosie's condition is classified as a DSD, or differences or disorders of sex development, by many physicians. Some patients and parents of patients -- including Eric and Stephani -- dislike this classification. They prefer the term intersex. Many conditions under the DSD/intersex umbrella could result in a variety of different physical sex characteristics on individuals, such as an enlarged clitoris or a micropenis. Atypical genitalia does not always occur in patients with CAH, but when it does, doctors sometimes encourage plastic surgery. Eric remembered learning about these operations as a student, and he was skeptical. Stephani stayed in the hospital with Rosie, who was still being monitored, and began to research the surgeries. At home, Eric did the same. They familiarized themselves with the list of potential long-term risks, such as chronic pain, an inability to orgasm or eventual rejection of gender assignment. If the doctors proposed surgery, Eric wanted to say no. Stephani didn't even anticipate that it would come up. ""My idea, because I was very naive about it, was that they would never recommend anything that wasn't necessary right now,"" Stephani said. ""Like, they wouldn't put a tiny baby under the knife for no reason. Can you imagine a world in which they're just doing cosmetic surgeries on babies? I couldn't even imagine that existed."" An 'easy' fix The surgical approach to CAH and other DSD/intersex conditions began in the 1960s, when doctors found ways to perform surgeries that reduced some of parents' anxieties about their babies. The surgeries were intended to help patients conform more with the mainstream characteristics of one sex or the other. But sometimes, the outcomes of these surgeries didn't align with patients' eventual gender identities. Over the years, some who had these surgeries grew to feel a misalignment between their sex and their gender, or felt that surgery had left them mutilated because their genitals lacked sexual sensation. This led to a wave of activism referred to as the intersex rights movement, with people speaking out and protesting medically unnecessary surgeries on children. Germany's third gender law is celebrated as a revolution. But some say it's just the first step Today, these surgeries are starting to be viewed more as cosmetic procedures instead of emergency treatments, but they are still performed. There's legislative pushback from the intersex community too, most recently seen through a California bill, SB 201. The bill would prohibit doctors from performing surgeries on minors with atypical genitalia unless the procedures are determined to be ""medically necessary"" or the child can provide informed consent beforehand. It is sponsored by Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco. The California Medical Association has formally opposed the bill and wrote a letter of opposition to the state Senate Committee on Business, Professions, and Economic Development. ""The bill makes an exception for any procedure or treatment that is deemed medically necessary, which is defined in such a way that cannot properly address the complexity of DSD cases and potentially endangers the physical and emotional health and future of the patient,"" the letter stated. In 2017, Human Rights Watch released a report on infant genital surgeries that are performed on babies with atypical genitalia, declaring it cruel and unnecessary. It provided detailed testimonials from individuals who had the surgeries and felt violated and damaged. About 1 in 2,000 babies is born with genitalia different enough that doctors might recommend surgery, according to the report. Shame, taboo, ignorance: Growing up intersex Tiger Devore, a Las Vegas-based clinical psychologist and advocate for people considered to be sexually different, said the rate of surgeries hasn't really changed since the 1960s. A 2016 study in the Journal of Pediatric Urology found that of 37 babies with what researchers called ""moderate-to-severe genital atypia"" who were born after 2011, 35 were subject to genital surgery. Devore was born in 1958 with hypospadias, a condition in which the urinary opening is on the underside of the penis instead of the tip. He had over 25 surgeries, many of them when he was a child. He describes them as painful and unnecessary. ""There are people who have grown up having these surgeries very early on in life. They're making it very clear to the medical society that these surgeries don't work, we don't like the outcomes, this shouldn't have been done to us as children,"" Devore said. ""It's our genitalia, and we want to grow up with our own genitalia. Not the genitalia that our doctors thought was right, not the genitalia our parents thought was right. It's our body."" Surgeries are typically performed to treat the anxiety of the parents, which is not fair to the infant, he said. The notion is that kids will have a better life because their genitals will look normal, but often that's not the case, he said. ""If you do plastic surgery on the genitalia, you do not magically get normal male or female genitalia. We get intersex genitalia that has had plastic surgery done to it,"" he said. The parents' decision to consent rests heavily on their education on the subject, he said. ""If they take a moment to do a little research, it can make a huge difference for the future of the child,"" he said. Feeling the pressure Three days after Rosie was born, Eric and Stephani were invited to a meeting with specialists to discuss steps. They recall walking into a room with more than a dozen medical staff: pediatric gynecologists, geneticists, pediatric urologists, endocrinologists and a social worker. ""It was probably the most intimidating room I've ever been in,"" Eric said. 'The protocol of the day was to lie': NYC issues first US 'intersex' birth certificate Rosie's parents said a pediatric urologist presented them with two options only: They could reduce the size of Rosie's clitoris and create a vaginal canal, or solely do the vaginal canal surgery. He recommended that Rosie have both procedures done simultaneously at about 6 months old, and preferably not much later than that. The argument was that the younger Rosie was, the faster she would heal, and she wouldn't have to experience looking physically different from other children. After thorough research, Rosie's parents knew that they didn't want either procedure. To their dismay, not having any surgery was never presented to them as a possibility, Eric said. And when he brought it up, the doctor said that was a choice he wouldn't recommend, due to the risk that Rosie might eventually experience psychological trauma from not looking like other girls. The rest of the staff stayed silent, Stephani said. ""It would have been nice to think that we had one ally in there, but we didn't,"" Stephani said. The doctor's sentiment was that if Rosie looked normal, she would feel better about herself. Eric and Stephani felt there was nothing wrong with appearing different, and if there was going to be a surgery, Rosie deserved a choice in the matter. They remained adamant about not consenting to the surgeries. Meanwhile, the couple was advised by the social worker to be careful when explaining Rosie's condition to other people, including her older brother and sister. Rosie at home in the summer of 2013. David Sandberg, a psychologist at University of Michigan who provides clinical services to children with DSD/intersex conditions and their families, said his first step when dealing with families who have a newborn with one of these conditions is to help them figure out the best way to share the information with people they trust. ""The story doesn't have to be all the details. But there should be nothing that would be considered a lie in retrospect,"" said Sandberg, who was not involved in Rosie's care. ""It could be a partial story. It could be less technical. But it has to be based in truth. Because once you go down the road of telling a non-truth, then it's very difficult to extricate yourself from that."" The Lohmans continued to feel pressured by their pediatric urologist to consider surgery, even as Rosie approached her first birthday. After putting their foot down and saying they wouldn't consent, the same pediatric urologist waved them away, Eric said, as if to say they would be back within a few years. (The pediatric urologist declined to comment for this story.) It's been years since that appointment, and they still haven't returned. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, its guidelines about atypical genitalia are being reviewed. ""The American Academy of Pediatrics agrees it's important that a child's medical team and parents engage in open, transparent conversations so that parents fully understand their child's condition and the risks and benefits of any proposed treatment, as well as alternatives, such as delaying surgery,"" the organization said in a statement. More US teens are rejecting 'boy' or 'girl' gender identities, a study finds Dr. Veronica Gomez-Lobo, director of pediatric and adolescent gynecology at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, said she agrees with the American Academy of Pediatrics' statement and the further goals it states of ""helping children to have a happy and healthy life."" Gomez-Lobo has worked with many families at the PROUD Clinic, which provides specialized diagnostic, evaluation and treatment services for children with complex diseases, including those that result in atypical genitalia. When an infant is born with one of these conditions, the first priority at the clinic is allowing parents to form a relationship with their child, she said. ""We don't even need to see these children until they've bonded with the parents, and so we don't even see them for an evaluation until about a month after they're born,"" she said. For patients with CAH, clinic workers first make sure that all of the medical needs are being addressed and treated, Gomez-Lobo said. After that is taken care of, they inform parents of the benefits and risks of genital surgeries, and they now mention the Human Rights Watch report, she said. ""We don't know whether making a clitoris smaller has any benefit,"" she said. ""Whether that's going to make the child grow up with a better self-image or something like that, nobody has evaluated that. But there is some literature that supports that maybe doing clitoral surgery may reduce the sensation, and it depends on how it's done and a lot of different reasons."" Out in the open After Rosie's diagnosis, the Lohmans spent a lot of time at home and were open about Rosie's condition only to family. ""Pretty soon, I started to feel like that was wrong,"" Stephani said. When they began to feel nervous about hiring babysitters who would have to change Rosie's diapers, they decided to share the secret. ""I was like, 'this is ridiculous. This is just making it shameful. Sometimes, I don't feel like we're doing her a favor,' "" Stephani said. ""We had the thought that we are contributing to this culture of shame. We're perpetuating what exactly it is we're trying to avoid."" Rosie at home in 2014. Rosie was 18 months old when they stopped hiding her condition and were frank about it with friends and others outside the family, Stephani said. At age 4, Rosie was featured in the documentary ""Gender Revolution: A Journey with Katie Couric,"" now available on Netflix. The family now lives in Milwaukee. Eric is on the board of directors of interACT, an organization dedicated to raising the visibility of intersex children and fighting for laws protecting intersex youth against surgeries. Recently, they brought Rosie to a protest at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, where they called on the facility to end the practice of medically unnecessary infant genital surgeries. In July, Eric and Stephani released a book about their experience raising an intersex child, ""Raising Rosie."" And in August, Eric flew to California to testify before the state's Committee on Health in favor of a resolution that condemned unnecessary surgery on children with intersex conditions. Weeks later, the resolution passed, making California the first state to denounce such surgeries. The resolution was introduced by Wiener, who sponsored the bill that would prohibit some of these surgeries. Outing Rosie as intersex to the public has been the most troubling decision for the Lohmans, Eric said. Eric and Stephani have written a letter for Rosie to read when she is old enough, explaining how they came to the decision to speak out about her condition. They hope she'll understand. Until then, they are focused on making her as comfortable with her body as possible. As she gets older, they plan to prepare her for how to deal with addressing her condition in front of her peers and choosing when to be private. ""If the time comes and we're like, 'OK, now she's gonna have a sleepover,' we'll say, 'well, we want you to know that this is your body, and you should feel comfortable talking about it, and you don't have to show anybody your body, but there's nothing to be ashamed of,' "" Eric said. Rosie's family, and their new puppy, now live in Milwaukee. The risks of surgery on a child with differences of sexual development are well-known, the University of Michigan's Sandberg said, but the risks of avoiding surgery  -- which is still rare  -- are not clear. When he faces a family who wants to operate on their newborn with atypical genitalia or a family who is adamantly against it, he makes sure to warn them of the risks that could result from either decision. Because there's very little published evidence on how the children who don't have surgery do growing up, all he can do is speculate. ""Being different in some way doesn't necessarily hurt you, but it is not an advantage,"" Sandberg said. ""And so one has to know something about the factors that make a child more vulnerable for being rejected or neglected by peers. And those would be things that in a gradual, developmentally appropriate way that I would tell some families. But I would sort of telegraph that early on. If I have any value at all to the family, it's engaging them in a discussion that continues over time, as the child gets older. And then, over time, engaging the child in these conversations."" On the other hand, Devore, the Las Vegas clinical psychologist, said he thinks there should be only one approach toward helping parents who have a child with one of these conditions. Get
""We feel strongly that people who are ob-gyns and other people who deliver babies need to be taught to say, 'you have given birth to a healthy intersex child. Not just a male child. Not just a female child. Or a child that has problems. You have given birth to a healthy intersex child,' "" he said. "" 'Someday, that child may choose to have surgery or not. But the hospital will provide genetic counseling, neurologic counseling and psychological counseling so that your family can face this challenge in a healthy way and so that your child can be given the guidance to understand their difference.' "" Devore expects younger generations, as well as younger physicians, to be more open-minded about intersex conditions and variability of expression. The changing environment can be seen on college campuses, in the media and on Facebook, he said. Intersex is a viable identity that shouldn't be seen as unhealthy, he said. But it is just as important for individuals born with atypical genitalia to have the right to not be defined by that, either. ""If people have a sense of themselves as male or have a sense of themselves as female, no matter what their genitals look like, they get to identify that way,"" he said. ""And that's the most basic point that we could have emphasized. It is the right of the individual to determine how they choose to identify. It is not the right of the parent. It is not the right of the physician or surgeon."" Nothing out of the ordinary Rosie is now 6 years old and has never had genital surgery. She has big green eyes and blonde hair that she prefers be kept short. Dresses are among her favorite things to wear. Her parents describe her as ""intrepid"" and ""brave."" ""She wants a mohawk,"" Eric said. ""We try to tell her that having a mohawk is unpractical in Wisconsin because you have to wear a winter hat. But she wants short hair, so that's what she has."" Silas, left, and Rosie, right, in 2017. ""Rosie's awesome. She's a firecracker,"" Stephani said. They have told Rosie that her body is different from other people's but that many people have differences in their bodies. ""And that's OK,"" Eric said. If Rosie ever expressed a desire to have a clitoral reduction, Eric said, they would begin the process by having her speak to a therapist, an intersex person who had surgery and an intersex person who has not had surgery. ""If that happens in a year, then we'll start it in a year, and if it happens when she's 16, then we'll do it then,"" he said. They would urge her to wait until she's a teen, at least, and until she has experienced sexual pleasure, because of the procedure's potential effect on sexual sensations. Rosie's been taking medication for CAH since she was a baby. She now takes three pills a day to keep her cortisol and electrolyte levels balanced. Pills swallowed at 7:30 a.m., 3:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. prevent her from going into adrenal crisis. Rosie's health is stable, and she's learning to care for her condition independently. With this medical routine, Rosie's health is stabilized. She's beginning to learn how to take care of her condition independently and carries around a rescue kit in case she goes into adrenal crisis. But her parents are still concerned about what the future holds. Sicknesses and hospitalizations are inevitable with her condition, Eric said, and he's nervous about the quality of her health care when she's older -- as well as the possibility of schools and jobs being unforgiving about her having to take time off. Even though Rosie has been raised as a girl, it's important to her parents to refer to her as intersex and to encourage gender fluidity. In other words, they don't confine her gender expression to that of a boy or a girl. Since Rosie identifies as a girl, her parents check off ""female"" under the sex category when filling out forms. She's in first grade this year and has developed a group of core friends. She uses the girls' bathroom and has yet to be confronted by other students about her body. But they are confident that with her type of personality, she'll either not care or laugh about it, if anyone were to point out her differences. Her teachers are aware of her condition and have been compassionate, he said. Parents in their community have also been accepting. ""As of right now, she's very stable, and we have a very supportive network,"" Eric said. ""It's almost as if nobody cares about the intersex part of her."""
A Pennsylvania police officer shot an unarmed man in the stomach - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Ralph Ellis, CNN",04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/jail-shooting-no-charges/index.html,"(CNN) A small-town Pennsylvania police officer will not face charges after shooting an unarmed man during a struggle because the officer honestly believed at the time he was using his Taser, not his service weapon, the Bucks County district attorney's office says in a statement.
District Attorney Matthew Weintraub said the March 3 shooting was ""was neither justified, nor criminal, but was excused,"" according to the statement posted on the DA's office website . ""Weintraub said the law excuses the shooting officer's conduct from criminal prosecution because of his 'honest but mistaken' belief he was deploying his Taser at the time he discharged his service weapon,"" the statement said. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? The wounded man, Brian Riling, was hospitalized in critical condition for several days after being shot in the stomach but has since been released, the statement said. The New Hope officer, who was not identified because he wasn't charged, was placed on paid administrative leave and retired from the department April 10, the statement said. Read More The investigation conducted by detectives employed by the DA's office was partly based on a video shot inside a holding cell in the police station in New Hope, a town of 2,500 people about 40 miles north of Philadelphia. The statement refers several times to a letter Weintraub sent to the New Hope police chief, but the DA's office won't release that letter, said James O'Malley, the communications director for the DA's office. CNN reached out to Riling's lawyer and has yet to receive a response. CNN also tried to contact Weintraub and the New Hope police chief, Michael Cummings, but did not receive a response. Struggle inside a holding cell Riling was in police custody after being charged March 3 with intimidation and retaliation against a victim, simple assault and related offenses stemming from an incident on the same day, the district attorney's statement said. He was also charged with burglarizing the same victim's home in mid-February, the statement said. The video shows Riling removing his belt inside the cell at an officer's direction when a white, rectangular object falls from his pants to the floor. Riling puts his foot on the object. The DA's statement said the object was ""consistent with a drug baggie."" The video shows the officer pushing Riling onto a concrete bench but Riling resists and the men struggle. The DA's statement said Riling threw the object into the toilet, but the toilet is not visible in the video. Ex-Oklahoma deputy gets 4 years for mistaking gun for Taser A second officer comes into the cell to help the first officer. While holding his service weapon in his right hand, the second officer yells ""Taser"" and shoots Riling in the stomach, the video shows. The two officers leave the cell for a moment. The DA's statement says Riling flushes the toilet during this time, but the toilet can't be seen. The first officer comes back into the cell and at first orders Riling to get onto the seat. But Riling lies on the floor, saying, ""I don't want to die, dude,"" and ""Why'd you shoot me? Are you kidding me?"" Later he asks, ""What the [expletive] is wrong with that guy?"" 'He did not possess the criminal mental state' The DA's statement discusses the officer's ""mindset"" during the incident. The officer who shot Riling was aware of Riling's ""criminal episodes"" before the shooting and heard Riling make violent threats during a phone call with the ""previously mentioned victim,"" the statement said. ""Given the totality of circumstances, the officer would have been justified in using his Taser to regain control of Riling inside the holding cell, DA Weintraub said in his letter [to the police chief], as the officer had a reasonable belief the scuffle posed a danger to his fellow officer,"" the statement said. ""The use of a firearm must be an officer's last resort, Weintraub wrote, and was not justified in this case. However, the letter [to the police chief] continues, because the officer believed he was deploying his Taser and not wielding his service firearm, he did not possess the criminal mental state required to be guilty of a crime under state law."" The statement mentions a section of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code which says a person has a defense to a criminal charge if he makes a mistake for which there is ""a reasonable explanation or excuse."" The DA's statement says the officer violated a department policy by wearing the Taser on his right side, in front of his firearm, instead of on the . ""non-dominant side, in what is known as a cross-draw position."" That policy violation didn't constitute a violation of law, though, the statement concludes. ""Weintraub also considered the officer's decades of exemplary service to the citizens of New Hope as evidenced by dozens of commendations and letters, as compared to relatively few minor historical infractions on his service record,"" the statement said. The New Hope Police Department posted this statement on its website : ""The Department thanks District Attorney Weintraub and the members of his office for their thorough investigation and report. The police department has no further information to release, and no further comment on this matter."" Previous cases This is not the first time an officer has shot a suspect with a gun, thinking he was using a Taser. Robert Bates, a reserve deputy with the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office in Oklahoma, said he meant to use his Taser stun gun, not his revolver, on suspect Eric Courtney Harris, who had been tackled by other deputies and was being held on the ground on April 2, 2015. Bates was convicted of second-degree manslaughter and given a four-year sentence. In a 2009 case, a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer fired his gun instead of his Taser, killing 22-year-old Oscar Grant in Oakland, California. The former officer, Johannes Mehserle, testified that he had meant to use his Taser but drew his gun instead. Mehserle was sentenced to two years in priso n for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct."

"Survey: As many Americans claim no religion as there are evangelicals, Catholics - CNN",www.cnn.com,"Neil Monahan and Saeed Ahmed, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/no-religion-largest-group-first-time-usa-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) For the first time ""No Religion"" has topped a survey of Americans' religious identity, according to a new analysis by a political scientist. The non-religious edged out Catholics and evangelicals in the long-running General Social Survey.
Ryan Burge, a political scientist at Eastern Illinois University and a Baptist pastor, found that 23.1% of Americans now claim no religion. Catholics came in at 23.0%, and evangelicals were at 22.5%. The three groups remain within the margin of error of each other though, making it a statistical tie. Over 2,000 people were interviewed in person for the survey. A growing number of Americans reject organized religion Pope Francis leaves the Basilica of SantAnselmo on March 6, 2019 in Rome. Read More ""Religious nones,"" as they are called by researchers, are a diverse group made up of atheists, agnostics, the spiritual, and those who are no specific organized religion in particular. A rejection of organized religion is the common thread they share. ""It is the first time we have seen this. The same questions have been asked for 44 years,"" Burge told CNN. The meteoric rise of religious nones began in the early 1990s and has grown 266% since 1991, he said. Burge estimates that 'No Religion' will be the largest group outright in four to six years. The reasons why the numbers explode d Richard Dawkins posing for an atheist advertising campaign Experts still debate the factors behind this wave of Americans declaring no religion. One reason could be the internet, says Nick Fish, the president of American Atheists. It provides a place for nonbelievers to find each other. ""The ease of access to the internet helped build communities where they didn't feel alone,"" he says. Robyn Blumner, executive director of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science, sees the change as a generational trend driven by millennials. ""We are seeing the rise of a generation of Americans who are hungry for facts and curious about the world,"" she says. They are an underrepresented group Whatever the causes, the non-religious represent a growing constituency. Yet this demographic is greatly underrepresented in Washington's halls of power.

Anti-vaxers are winning the war on social media. What's the CDC going to do about it?,www.cnn.com,"Elizabeth Cohen, CNN",04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/health/cdc-vax-advisers/index.html,"Anti-vaxers are winning the war on social media. What's the CDC going to do about it? CNN 1 day ago By Elizabeth Cohen, CNN © Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images North America/Getty Images
Concerned that anti-vaccination activists are winning the war on social media, advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say public health authorities need to figure out how to fight back.
""Have we done enough? I think the answer to that is no,"" said Patricia Stinchfield, a pediatric nurse practitioner and a liaison representative to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices .
While anti-vaxers were once considered fringe, there are now dozens of anti-vaccine groups on Facebook trying to convince parents of various untruths, such as that vaccines cause autism.
""This anti-vaccine issue has been driven by social media and will continue to be driven by social media,"" said Dr. Matthew Zahn, another liaison representative to the committee. ""I don't see it as a scenario we are going to win anytime soon.""
The results have become painfully obvious. As vaccination rates have declined , measles rates have increased.
This year, at least 465 cases of measles have been reported in the United States, according to the CDC. That's the second highest number of cases in the country in any year since 2000 -- and the year isn't even halfway over.
'The good guys haven't gotten themselves organized'
To get an idea of what the CDC and others could do to combat anti-vaxer propaganda on social media, CNN interviewed 10 current and former liaison members of the CDCs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which develops recommendations on the use of vaccines.
They represent professional organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners.
Although none of the liaison members was critical of the CDC, they said the agency could play a role in finding a more effective approach for encouraging vaccination on social media.
""I feel like on social media, the anti-vaxers are very sophisticated and active and way ahead of us,"" said Stinchfield, who, as senior director of infection control at the Minnesota Children's Hospital, helped manage a large measles outbreak in 2017.
Liaison member Dr. William Schaffner added, ""I don't think the good guys have gotten themselves organized. There's a frustration that we don't have a clear plan going forward. It's almost as though we've left the field to"" the anti-vaxers.
Some of the advisers said the CDC could, for example, fund social media outreach efforts and then help study which work best.
It's unclear whether the agency itself thinks public health needs to up its social media game.
A representative declined an interview, instead issuing this statement:
""Parents have many questions about vaccines and are seeking answers. There is a lot of information about vaccines available, unfortunately, some of the information about vaccines is inaccurate. It is critical that parents and anyone seeking information about vaccines have access to credible information. CDC is a critical source for credible health information about vaccines. We are committed to providing up-to-date, science-based recommendations that anyone, including parents, kids, health departments, businesses, and healthcare providers, can use to make informed health decisions. Additionally, CDC's online information is in the public domain and free for anyone to access, use or repurpose.
""When CDC engages in social media, we aim to consistently provide science-based and timely information in understandable language. We provide information to parents and the general public. We also focus on providing information to health care providers that they can utilize to talk to their patients. Parents still trust their healthcare provider to help them make healthcare decisions.""
Getting into the mud
The challenge for public health authorities, including the CDC, is formidable: to dislodge the fear of vaccines that anti-vaxers have planted in the minds of some parents.
""It's a lot easier to instill fear in someone's head than to remove it,"" said Dr. Sean O'Leary, another liaison member. ""And I think the scientific community was somewhat caught off-guard by this.""
Explaining that more than a dozen studies have shown no link between vaccines and autism might not help.
""The conventional wisdom has been to provide the scientific facts, and people will make the right decisions,"" O'Leary said. ""But I think it's a lot more complicated than that.""
Going beyond the scientific facts is problematic, too. Health care professionals say they don't want to sink to the level of anti-vaxers, who often use fear-mongering to get their point across.
""They're persistent and vociferous, and it's unpleasant. And so in a sense, I don't want to get down into the mud with these people,"" said Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.
He added that the CDC in particular is at a disadvantage for two reasons. One, there's a distrust of authority in general in the Trump era. Two, the anti-vaxers have villainized the CDC in particular, planting seeds of doubt in the minds of parents who might be hesitant about vaccines.
""The CDC is handcuffed from the start,"" Schaffner said.
Not a lost cause
While the challenges are formidable, some of the advisers see light at the end of the tunnel.
O'Leary, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and his colleagues had some success with creating a special social media site for new parents.
As part of a study , 888 pregnant women were divided into three groups. One of those groups had access to a website that included networking options where the mothers could communicate with each other and with doctors.
The babies of the women who had access to that social media site were more likely to be fully vaccinated at 6 months old than the babies of the women who didn't have access to that site.
It was just one study, but the advisers said it indicates that there is a way to win the social media war.
""A silver bullet doesn't exist out there,"" said Zahn, medical director of the Division of Epidemiology and Assessment for the Orange County Health Care Agency in California. ""But I certainly don't see this as a lost cause.""

Indian elections: A new board game shows the sleazier side of the campaign,edition.cnn.com,"Manveena Suri, CNN",04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/13/india/india-election-game-intl/index.html,"New Delhi (CNN) Staging a mass rally. Spreading fake news. Fueling caste tensions. Playing the religion card.
These are among the more unsavory tactics that have allegedly been used by some Indian political parties as they scramble for votes during election season. Now, with the country of 1.3 billion people embarking once again on the world's biggest democratic exercise , a new board game is simulating something of that campaign process -- offering players both the standard and the sleazier electoral strategies. The Poll: The Great Indian Election Game is the brainchild of 27-year-old journalist Abeer Kapoor, who came up with the idea in 2017 after covering national and state elections. Abeer Kapoor with the board game he invented that was inspired by India's political system. ""I started thinking about how parties are like players where they have a set of fixed resources like money, feet on the ground, party workers, ideologies and the media and other institutions. But the terrain, the state constituencies, are different,"" said Kapoor. Read More ""So, it's like a game, and we should be able to simulate that in a way that breaks the barrier between people and politics. We want people to understand the process."" The game has also provided Kapoor with a unique insight into Indian voters and their political preferences. The Westminster system India is a former British colony, and its political system follows the Westminster model. Parties field candidates for seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, and whichever party wins a majority of seats gets to choose the prime minister. Across 543 constituencies , candidates will vie for votes from an electorate numbering 900 million, nearly triple the population of the United States. The board game, three to four people, each of whom represents a political party and creates a manifesto by choosing ""policy cards"" which he or she must defend. Jargon has been lifted from real party manifestos and definitions taken from high school textbooks, since one of Kapoor's goals is to educate players in the process -- warts and all. ""I realized early on that if I built an ideal situation that did not mimic an Indian election, there would be a huge cognitive dissonance when people encounter (actual) elections,"" said Kapoor. With money, media strategies and manifestos, the game sets out to recreate the process of India's elections. A player who manages to convince opponents their strategy will work places cubes on top of a constituency card. Players use both financial resources and campaign strategies as they battle for influence. The game, Kapoor said, does not offer lessons about the morality of politics. ""We want people to understand the process of an election, that there are issues and there are promises that are made and we don't always hold people accountable for that,"" he said. With #Elections2019 around the corner we are in RD&SH National College Mumbai thanks to @Prajafoundation and @FNFSouthAsia and got a 35 kids to play the game! pic.twitter.com/vwGFxXymX0
— The Poll Game (@poll_game) February 27, 2019 The influences behind political beliefs The game, which is available in Hindi and English, was launched in January, and Kapoor has been traveling the country to promote it. Along the way, he's noticed that the way people play it reflects their background and experiences of politics. ""We found that in an urban metropolis like Delhi, we aren't talking to each other about politics. So, you see that apprehension, you see more rigidity built in to the way that people want to see the world. The echo chambers become extremely visible in urban settings,"" said Kapoor. Constituency cards provide details of the geography and demographics of a district, along with how many seats it accounts for and the main issues at stake. ""If you move away from that to kids coming from more disadvantaged backgrounds in Mumbai, you see a lot more negotiation. This is their life, negotiating with the state. They're far more argumentative and comfortable with the idea of discussing the issues that matter."" In Lucknow, a city in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, some participants established a game on the side. ""In Uttar Pradesh, which is the hub of Indian politics, you see there's a casualness built in to corruption. One part of the game is where people argue to keep their constituencies, but by the end of it they were just trading money. They saw money on the board, and they didn't care about the arguments,"" said Kapoor. Poll predictions The real-life game kicked off on April 11. Because polling a country of this size is such a mammoth task, the voting will take place in phases across the country which will end on May 19. The winner will be announced on May 23. The ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party is being challenged by a coalition led by the secular Congress Party . Players choose a number of policy cards that will form the foundation of their manifesto. Having traveled the country during election season, does Kapoor have any predictions? ""We know what party people support by the manifesto and policy cards they pick. What I see is that this election is wide open. There are enough snarky comments made on the lack of delivery of this government and there are enough people who will stand up for it,"" said Kapoor. ""If anyone thinks this election is done and dusted on either side, it's too soon to call. It's going to be a very interesting election."""

A Pennsylvania police officer shot an unarmed man in the stomach,us.cnn.com,"Ralph Ellis, CNN",04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/jail-shooting-no-charges/index.html,"(CNN) A small-town Pennsylvania police officer will not face charges after shooting an unarmed man during a struggle because the officer honestly believed at the time he was using his Taser, not his service weapon, the Bucks County district attorney's office says in a statement.
District Attorney Matthew Weintraub said the March 3 shooting was ""was neither justified, nor criminal, but was excused,"" according to the statement posted on the DA's office website . ""Weintraub said the law excuses the shooting officer's conduct from criminal prosecution because of his 'honest but mistaken' belief he was deploying his Taser at the time he discharged his service weapon,"" the statement said. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? The wounded man, Brian Riling, was hospitalized in critical condition for several days after being shot in the stomach but has since been released, the statement said. The New Hope officer, who was not identified because he wasn't charged, was placed on paid administrative leave and retired from the department April 10, the statement said. Read More The investigation conducted by detectives employed by the DA's office was partly based on a video shot inside a holding cell in the police station in New Hope, a town of 2,500 people about 40 miles north of Philadelphia. The statement refers several times to a letter Weintraub sent to the New Hope police chief, but the DA's office won't release that letter, said James O'Malley, the communications director for the DA's office. CNN reached out to Riling's lawyer and has yet to receive a response. CNN also tried to contact Weintraub and the New Hope police chief, Michael Cummings, but did not receive a response. Struggle inside a holding cell Riling was in police custody after being charged March 3 with intimidation and retaliation against a victim, simple assault and related offenses stemming from an incident on the same day, the district attorney's statement said. He was also charged with burglarizing the same victim's home in mid-February, the statement said. The video shows Riling removing his belt inside the cell at an officer's direction when a white, rectangular object falls from his pants to the floor. Riling puts his foot on the object. The DA's statement said the object was ""consistent with a drug baggie."" The video shows the officer pushing Riling onto a concrete bench but Riling resists and the men struggle. The DA's statement said Riling threw the object into the toilet, but the toilet is not visible in the video. Ex-Oklahoma deputy gets 4 years for mistaking gun for Taser A second officer comes into the cell to help the first officer. While holding his service weapon in his right hand, the second officer yells ""Taser"" and shoots Riling in the stomach, the video shows. The two officers leave the cell for a moment. The DA's statement says Riling flushes the toilet during this time, but the toilet can't be seen. The first officer comes back into the cell and at first orders Riling to get onto the seat. But Riling lies on the floor, saying, ""I don't want to die, dude,"" and ""Why'd you shoot me? Are you kidding me?"" Later he asks, ""What the [expletive] is wrong with that guy?"" 'He did not possess the criminal mental state' The DA's statement discusses the officer's ""mindset"" during the incident. The officer who shot Riling was aware of Riling's ""criminal episodes"" before the shooting and heard Riling make violent threats during a phone call with the ""previously mentioned victim,"" the statement said. ""Given the totality of circumstances, the officer would have been justified in using his Taser to regain control of Riling inside the holding cell, DA Weintraub said in his letter [to the police chief], as the officer had a reasonable belief the scuffle posed a danger to his fellow officer,"" the statement said. ""The use of a firearm must be an officer's last resort, Weintraub wrote, and was not justified in this case. However, the letter [to the police chief] continues, because the officer believed he was deploying his Taser and not wielding his service firearm, he did not possess the criminal mental state required to be guilty of a crime under state law."" The statement mentions a section of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code which says a person has a defense to a criminal charge if he makes a mistake for which there is ""a reasonable explanation or excuse."" The DA's statement says the officer violated a department policy by wearing the Taser on his right side, in front of his firearm, instead of on the . ""non-dominant side, in what is known as a cross-draw position."" That policy violation didn't constitute a violation of law, though, the statement concludes. ""Weintraub also considered the officer's decades of exemplary service to the citizens of New Hope as evidenced by dozens of commendations and letters, as compared to relatively few minor historical infractions on his service record,"" the statement said. The New Hope Police Department posted this statement on its website : ""The Department thanks District Attorney Weintraub and the members of his office for their thorough investigation and report. The police department has no further information to release, and no further comment on this matter."" Previous cases This is not the first time an officer has shot a suspect with a gun, thinking he was using a Taser. Robert Bates, a reserve deputy with the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office in Oklahoma, said he meant to use his Taser stun gun, not his revolver, on suspect Eric Courtney Harris, who had been tackled by other deputies and was being held on the ground on April 2, 2015. Bates was convicted of second-degree manslaughter and given a four-year sentence. In a 2009 case, a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer fired his gun instead of his Taser, killing 22-year-old Oscar Grant in Oakland, California. The former officer, Johannes Mehserle, testified that he had meant to use his Taser but drew his gun instead. Mehserle was sentenced to two years in priso n for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct."

Petyr Baelish can't just tell Sweet Robin that some men die on the privy without a toilet-bound Tywin Lannister getting two arrows to the gut a few episodes later. Maggy the Frog can't just tell a young Cersei Lannister that she'll have three royal children who will die without Cersei actually having three royal children who bite the dust in increasingly tragic ways. It means that in the final few episodes, basically every detail, line of dialogue and theory from the past seven seasons could very well be at the center of some mind-blowing revelation. However, a LOT has happened, and you'd be forgiven if somewhere between the Red Wedding and Margaery Tyrell becoming green mist, the section of your brain devoted to ""Game of Thrones"" deep cuts got a little overloaded. So, settle in to your favorite knobbly tree, let your eyes roll back in your head and let's journey through time and space to revisit 10 critical details that may or may not play a part in the final season -- but will be good to remember anyway. (NOTE: This list only includes things specifically mentioned or heavily implied in the series, so things like the Valonqar prophecy are not mentioned by name. Otherwise, we'd be here all day.) Read More 1. White Walker symbols In case you needed a clue that this story wasn't JUST about games and thrones, after all, the very first scene of Season 1, Episode 1 ends with a very cryptic arrangement of dead bodies, executed by the very murder snowmen we've come to know and fear. We see the White Walkers using circular patterns pretty often, and a spiral pattern of dead bodies in Season 3, Episode 3 is echoed again in Season 6, Episode 5 when the Children of the Forest set about making the Night King. We can assume these aren't isolated incidents -- Mance Rayder even comments that the White Walkers are ""ever the artists."" And the spirals are back in Season 7, Episode 4 when Jon shows Daenerys cave paintings of the White Walkers that feature the mysterious shapes. What does it all mean? Well, obviously we don't know yet, but here's another thought to keep you awake at night: Aside from those horrible dry ice screeches, White Walkers don't talk (as far as we know). If the Night King and Company are really going to be the epic antagonists this season, it's pretty likely we're going to learn more about their motives, which means they're going to have to communicate. How? Unless the Night King clears his throat and David Attenborough comes floating out, the answer may lie in these symbols. 2. Daenerys' vision in the House of the Undying Some ""GoT"" hints and prophesies are subtle, and some haul off and smack you right in the face years before you even know what to do with them. In Season 2, Episode 10 , Daenerys enters a symbolically rich vision while trying to escape the creepy warlocks of Qarth. In it, she explores a frozen, snowy version of the Red Keep, complete with a charred, burnt-out ceiling. Hmm. She then approaches the Iron Throne -- the one thing she thinks she wants, the one thing that has driven her entire odyssey in Essos. She gets close enough to touch it and ... doesn't. H . Let's not even get into the emotional reunion she has with Khal Drogo and her son Rhaego and focus on how likely it is that all of this very obvious imagery will come to pass. Because remember, as of now, the Red Keep is in one piece and Daenerys is torn between wanting the throne and not wanting every living person in Westeros to be turned into a skeleton puppet. Oh, and snow is definitely in the forecast for King's Landing. JUST WATCHED 'Game of Thrones' star describes 'fantastic' role Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
'Game of Thrones' star describes 'fantastic' role 02:25 3. Maggy the Frog's prophecy for Cersei ""You'll be queen, for a time. Then comes another, younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear."" Those are the words of Maggy the Frog, a witch young Cersei visits in Season 5, Episode 1 . Young Cersei, already very much a vicious queen-in-training, asks the woman for some predictions. And boy, does she deliver. Maggy the Frog accurately predicts baby Cersei's marriage to Robert Baratheon, his philandering ways, Cersei's three golden children and their three golden deaths. But that first tidbit hasn't yet come to pass. Sure, there was Margaery, but Cersei assured that she and almost every other Tyrell became vapor, so Daenerys is the obvious answer to the prophecy. What may be even more interesting to ponder is what, exactly, Cersei still ""holds dear."" Her children are gone, Jaime's done with her and her motivations seem less and less focused. Don't forget, though, Cersei really believes in prophecy: She notes to Jaime in Season 6 that everything Maggy said came true. No doubt she thinks about that while she's sitting on the Iron Throne in her fabulous black mourning clothes. (Another deep dive on this: Maggy the Frog also says to Cersei that her ""joy will turn to ashes in her mouth,"" which could just be a figurative and rather metal threat. However, and bear with us here, in Season 3, Episode 4 , Joffrey throws us an interesting morsel: While wooing Margaery with various dead things, Joffrey points out the skull of Aerion Targaryen, who died because he thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon. Spoiler alert: It didn't. But given Cersei's Targaryen-like penchant for wildfire, paranoia and vengeance, it's a pretty interesting detail alongside ol' Maggy's colorful words.) 4. The reason Daenerys can't have children In case you haven't heard, Daenerys can't bear children. We know this because she has told literally everyone in the ""GoT"" universe and repeated it several times to Jon, a man she knows carnally but not genealogically (yet). Her reason for believing she's a lifelong dragon mom (the fantasy equivalent of a dog mom) goes back to Season 1, Episode 10 , when the witch Mirri Maz Duur tricks her into essentially trading the life of her unborn child for the life of her ailing husband Khal Drogo. However, she finds Drogo alive but not living, ya know, and when Daenerys asks Mirri when he'll be back in fighting shape, she replies: ""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before."" Which, of course, is fancy witch speak for ""never."" But judging by how often it has been noted that Dany can never have children, it's not unreasonable to suspect ""never"" is kind of flexible in this case. So will Mirri's words come echoing back in some poetic, heretofore unknown way? Mirri also tells Dany, ""Only death can pay for life."" Since that could describe about a dozen different ""Game of Thrones"" scenarios past and present, it's worth keeping in your bank of general ""GoT"" wisdom. 5. Weirwood trees Hey, remember those? The spooky red and white trees that used to grow across Westeros and hold deep religious significance, especially for people in the north? The ones that sometimes bear carved faces and weep sap and seem to always pop up when something mythologically important happens? Some quick reminders: Weirwood trees seem to have some sort of magical connection to ancient races, specifically the Children of the Forest. Greenseers who possess warging abilities and the ability to see the past and the future, can use weirwood trees to essentially look through, like time periscopes. There is a heart tree (a special weirwood with a carved face) still at Winterfell, and under its branches, a ridiculous amount of important stuff has happened, most recently several reunions of the Stark children and the tragic, ill-fated marriage of Sansa and Ramsay Bolton. Given that there is a lot of mythological explaining to be done and Winterfell will undoubtedly be the site of lots and lots of action and revelation, those trees might come back into play. Oh, and you know where else a weirwood tree made an appearance? In Season 6, Episode 5 , when the Children of the Forest make the Night King, they tie him to -- you got it -- a weirwood tree. 6. Bran's weirwood visions Speaking of trees, perhaps one of the most enticing puzzles in the whole story is Bran's garbled, alarming weirwood vision. In Season 4, Episode 2 , Bran touches a weirwood north of the wall and immediately goes into sensory overdrive: He sees the same snowy throne room Daenerys saw in Season 2 and the shadow of dragons flying over King's Landing. But what's really interesting about this vision is the stuff he sees from the past: He sees his father, Ned, cleaning his sword underneath the heart tree in Winterfell. He sees Ned's panicked face in the dungeons of King's Landing before his execution. He also sees the creepy wight girl that was part of the opening sequence of the pilot episode. Not to mention, he gets glimpses of the Land of Always Winter, the north-iest northern part of Westeros, where the Night King and his undead men reign. Are these different snippets supposed to form some pointillistic picture of truth that we have to take 10 steps back from to truly understand? Or are they just random, intriguing elements sewn together to make people wonder? 7. Melisandre's whole deal Look, Melisandre's made some mistakes. Stannis was a non-starter, Jon just wanted to be friends and burning a little girl was probably one of the worst things to ever happen in Westeros (and that's saying something). But if ""Game of Thrones"" has taught us anything, it's that we should definitely believe witches. Here are some big things to remember about the Red Priestess: In Season 3, Episode 6 , she accurately predicts Arya's future as an assassin/freelance murderer. She also says they ""will meet again."" That honestly cannot come soon enough. She left Westeros for Volantis last season, but not before telling Varys in Season 7, Episode 3 that she'd be back: ""I have to die in this strange country, just like you."" Now, she doesn't specify when this dying will happen, but let's assume it's not of old age on a golf course in Dorne. She definitely has some sort of visionary power past the whole flame thing. In Season 5, Episode 4 , after unsuccessfully trying to seduce Jon, she pulls out his dead lover Ygritte's secret line: ""You know nothing, Jon Snow."" How did she know? There are more of her. Remember Kinvara, the Red Priestess who earned the title of only person to ever really freak Varys out? In Season 6, Episode 1 , the beautiful Red Priestess comes to Meereen to side with Daenerys and drag out Varys' tragic past. Will we see her again? Since Melisandre is so confident in Jon and Dany, will she bring her Red Priestess friends to help fulfill the age of the Lord of Light? Only the flames know. Oh right, and she's ancient! In Season 6, Episode 1 , Melisandre takes off her necklace to reveal she's actually about 6,578 years old. We really need more details here.

Behind the music of 'Game of Thrones' 01:26 8. 'There must always be a Stark in Winterfell' The Starks have the esoteric, foreboding catchphrase game down: ""Winter is coming,"" ""The North remembers,"" and in Season 1, Episode 2 , Catelyn Stark relates another critical chestnut to her son Robb: ""There must always be a Stark in Winterfell."" This line has plagued show watchers and book readers for years, and since Winterfell is going to be a deeply important setting this year, it seems as good a time as any to get some answers. Remember, Starks are tied to the First Men, one of the three ancient ethnic groups to populate Westeros. They have a special connection to the land, the Wall (a Stark was said to have constructed it), the Night's Watch (a Stark was the first Lord Commander) and supposedly to the areas north of the wall. If the northern ground is really as heavy with magic and myth as they've made it seem, this line feels more like a prophesy than a boast. Could it come into play when war descends on Winterfell? 9. Sansa and Tyrion's marriage So much traumatic stuff has happened to Sansa in the past few seasons, it's almost quaint to think that her marriage to Tyrion in Season 3, Episode 8 was as bad as it was going to get. Tyrion and Sansa were forced to marry by Tywin Lannister, and not long after their nuptials, Joffrey dies at his own wedding and Sansa is spirited away in the melee. It's obvious their paths will cross soon, since Tyrion is Dany's Hand and Sansa is Lady of Winterfell. And given that Tyrion has pretty bad romantic abandonment issues and things for Sansa are just now starting to not be a total hell, there's probably no love lost there. Also, there will probably be tensions when Sansa finds out Jon has unilaterally aligned himself with a Targaryen and that Targaryen is championed by a Lannister. So, you know, awkwardness is coming. READ MORE: What ""Game of Thrones"" can tell us about trauma 10. White Walker babies Let's end where we began: We know the White Walkers are going to be important this season. We know that most of the big mysteries in the series surround their motives and their makeup. So, it's really important to remember that the way they come into this world is completely bizarre and mythologically unclear. In Season 4, Episode 4 , one of Craster's sons (Craster is an abusive, incestuous wildling who made a pact to give up his sons to the White Walkers) is picked up by the Night King's men and taken to the mysterious, icy world of the Land of Always Winter, where he is given an extreme baby makeover and turned into an itty-bitty White Walker. This all happens with a single forehead touch from the Night King, and luckily it all looks pretty painless. But that sequence, combined with the Children of the Forest's original Night King experiment (which involved a giant dragon glass dagger), doesn't really give us a clear picture of who these dudes are, why they exist or even how they exist. We need more information to make it clear. Heck, we need more of everything."
Tiger Woods poised to strike as Francesco Molinari leads Masters,rss.cnn.com,"Rob Hodgetts, CNN",04-14-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_golf/~3/FouKkN2k1Ss/index.html,"(CNN) If Saturday at the Masters was electric, Sunday could be supercharged.
The threat of severe thunderstorms has forced Augusta National officials to instigate a two-tee start in groups of three, with the leading trio of Francesco Molinari, Tiger Woods and Tony Finau off at 09:20 a.m. ET instead of in pairs mid afternoon. The hope is to get the fireworks wrapped up on the course before they come down from the sky. In Saturday's third round, if you weren't surging forwards you were going backwards. Four-time champion Woods parred his first four holes and was disappearing in the leaders' rear view mirror, but when he finally engaged gear at the seventh, he, too, roared up the leaderboard. A fifth birdie at the 16th sparked a tumultuous roar as he tied for the lead. Read More By the end of a sun-drenched, dazzling day of golf, Italy's British Open champion Molinari held a two-shot lead at 13 under over Woods and Finau going into the final round. Tiger Woods is bidding for a fifth Green Jacket at the Masters. 'Great test' Woods, of course, is trying to pull off a fairytale comeback with a fifth Green Jacket 14 years after his last, and a 15th major 11 years after his previous triumph. Inspired by his comeback season last year from spine fusion surgery, including second at the US PGA and culminating in a first victory for five years at the Tour Championship, Woods is rekindling memories of his heyday.

""This is a chance to win a major championship so I'm ready,"" he told BBC Sport, talking of Sunday's early start. Woods also said he was embracing the idea of adding to his major tally. ""That's part of the deal,"" he said. ""I'm playing for my fifth but I'm trying to win a golf tournament at the end of the day. I've just got to go out and execute. It's going to be a great test for all of us."" READ: Tiger Woods' charge lights at Masters Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos The Masters, Augusta – The opening major of the golf season is the Masters from Augusta, Georgia every April. It's a spring rite, steeped in tradition and layered in rich sporting history and drama. It's an event that attracts even non-golfers because of the sublime beauty of the course. Click through the gallery for an A-Z of the Masters. Hide Caption 1 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos A is for Augusta National – The revered course has hosted the year's opening major -- and the only one of the big four events to be played at the same course every year -- since 1934. A is also for the azaleas which traditionally blossom during Masters week and for Amen Corner , the infamous stretch of holes incorporating the 11th, the treacherous short 12th and the tee shot on the par-five 13th. Hide Caption 2 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos B is for Beauty – The Georgian greensward is an oasis among the urban landscape of Augusta, Georgia's second city on the banks of the Savannah River. The bars, burger joints and shopping malls of neighboring Washington Road are in stark contrast to the golfing dreamscape over the fence. B is also for Seve Ballesteros, the Spaniard who opened the European floodgates with wins in 1980 and 1983. Hide Caption 3 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos C is for Caddies – Augusta's caddies are instantly recognizable by their white jump suits. Before 1983, players had to use a club caddie, all of whom were local black men. Since then players have used their usual tour caddies, but they must still don the white suit and green cap. Hide Caption 4 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos D is for Dos and Don'ts – The hallowed property is governed by its own strict rules such as no running or cell phones, but on the flip side traditions exist such as the practice of placing your green Masters chair at your preferred spot and being able to return to your vacant seat hours later. Hide Caption 5 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos E is for Eisenhower – Former US President Dwight D. Eisenhower was a member of Augusta National and several landmarks of his era remain, including Ike's Pond, the fishing lake he championed that is the focal point of the Par-3 Contest. Eisenhower's white cabin also sits near the clubhouse. Hide Caption 6 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos F is for Fans (make that Patrons) – Visitors to Augusta National are known as patrons -- not fans or spectators or the crowd. Tickets are like gold dust, but a limited number of practice round tickets and tournament days are available through a yearly ballot. The waiting list for weekly tournament badges closed years ago. Hide Caption 7 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos G is for Grand Slam – Rory McIlroy just needs the Masters to complete the Grand Slam of all four of golf's major titles. The Northern Irishman blew a four-shot lead at Augusta in 2011, but having won four majors in the meantime returns for his fifth shot at the Grand Slam this week. Only five others have achieved the feat -- Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. G is also for greens -- the slick, sloping putting surfaces are infamous. Hide Caption 8 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos H is for History – Augusta National was created by Scottish golf course architect Dr. Alister Mackenzie and co-founder Bobby Jones and opened in 1933 on land that was once the site of Fruitlands Nursery. During World War II the land was briefly given over to turkey and cattle farming. Hide Caption 9 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos I is for Internationals – South African Gary Player -- pictured here in 2014 with Jack Nicklaus (left) and the late Arnold Palmer -- was the first international champion in 1961. Since then the Masters has been won 21 times by overseas players. The US counts for 60 wins from 37 different players. Hide Caption 10 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos J is for Jacket, as in green – The tropical-weight emerald blazer is worn by only Augusta National members and Masters champions. It was first introduced for members in 1937 and ordered from Brooks Uniform Company in New York. Sam Snead was the first winner to receive a jacket and honorary membership in 1949. The reigning Masters champion can take it home for a year, then it must be kept at the club. Hide Caption 11 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos K is for Key holes – The saying goes the Masters doesn't begin until the back nine on Sunday. It starts with one of the hardest holes on the course in the 10th and then enters Amen Corner with the equally tough 11th and then the booby trap of the short 12th. But the long 15th (pictured) is key -- big moves can be made with eagles here. Anything less than a birdie and you will likely go backwards. Hide Caption 12 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos L is for Lane, as in Magnolia Lane – The exclusive driveway to Augusta's historic clubhouse is framed by dozens of magnolia trees. Only members and Masters competitors are allowed to access this revered entrance which gives on to the Founder's Circle and then the whitewashed concrete clubhouse, built in 1854. Hide Caption 13 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos M is for Mickelson – Popular left-hander Phil Mickelson is one of 17 players to have won multiple Masters titles. The three-time champion won the first of his five major titles at Augusta in 2004 after three straight third places. Even at 48, Mickelson remains a Masters threat. Hide Caption 14 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos N is for Nicklaus, as in Jack – The most successful player at the Masters is Jack Nicklaus, whose six Green Jackets remains the record. The 79-year-old is now an honorary starter along with Gary Player, following the death of four-time champion Arnold Palmer in 2016. Hide Caption 15 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos O is for Oak tree – The famous old oak tree on the course side of the clubhouse is an iconic landmark and the traditional meeting place for the game's movers and shakers and media types with the correct credential. A familiar refrain of Masters week is: ""Meet you under the tree."" Hide Caption 16 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos P is for Par 3s, notably the 12th – Perhaps the most famous short hole in golf, the par-3 12th sits at the heart of Amen Corner. Like a wolf in sheep's clothing, it is just 155 yards long, but Rae's Creek looms large in front and a devilish wind always swirling around the trees makes club selection tricky. Hide Caption 17 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos Q is for Quonset Hut – Modern media are housed in a recently built state-of-the-art facility at the far end of the practice range, but in days gone by the stories from Augusta were crafted in a corrugated metal Quonset Hut. Hide Caption 18 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos R is for Roars – When the excitement rises on a Sunday afternoon and the patrons reach fever pitch, the roars reverberate around the towering pines which act like a giant organ reflecting the noise all over the course. A Phil Mickelson roar stands out, but a roar for Tiger Woods is like no other. Hide Caption 19 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos S is for Spieth – Jordan Spieth was on a fast track to being crowned the new king of Augusta following his wire-to-wire victory in 2015 and dominance for three rounds in 2016. He was still clear with nine holes to play before famously self destructing with two balls in the water on 12. The American has struggled of late and is down to 33rd in the world, but in five Masters appearances he has won, finished second twice, come third and 11th. Hide Caption 20 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos T is for Tradition – The Masters is forward looking but rooted in tradition, such as the pre-tournament Par-3 Contest, in which friends and family members caddie for the players and hit the occasional shot. Jack Nicklaus' grandson Gary made a hole in one last year. Other traditions include the Champions Dinner, in which the holder chooses the menu and hosts the evening on the Tuesday of Masters week Hide Caption 21 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos U is for Under par – When Jordan Spieth won in 2015 he equaled Tiger Woods' 1997 record for the lowest winning score at 18 under par. Hide Caption 22 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos V is for Views – Augusta's vistas are consistently spell-binding with the pines framing the holes and the lush grass, ice white of the bunkers and explosions of color from the flowers and patrons adding to the allure. Hide Caption 23 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos W is for Woods – Who else? Tiger Woods changed golf when he won his first major by a record 12 shots in 1997. He went on to win three further Green Jackets, the last of which came in 2005 after a famous chip-in on the 16th. The 43-year-old is fit again after multiple back surgeries, and among the widely tipped contenders. Hide Caption 24 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos X is for X-factor – Winning the Masters requires a game in mint condition and a bit of something special. Think Tiger Woods' chip-in on the 16th in 2005, or Phil Mickelson's shot threaded through trees on the 13th in 2010. Or what about Bubba Watson's banana ball from the woods on the 10th to clinch a play off in 2012 (pictured)? Hide Caption 25 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos Y is for Youngest winner – Tiger Woods' 1997 win for the first of 14 majors so far made him the youngest Masters champion at the age of 21. Hide Caption 26 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos Z is for Zenith – For many players, winning the Masters represents the zenith of their career. Phil Mickelson's jump for joy in 2004 at his 11th attempt kick started an era which yielded further victories in 2006 and 2010. Hide Caption 27 of 27 'Good fun' Off the course, the consensus is Woods has mellowed over the years and become more approachable after his injury woes and life struggles. Walking off the 18th following his impressive and at times fortunate 67 Saturday -- three times he drove into trees but escaped with a shot at the green -- he was all smiles and trading high and low fives with children and patrons lining the ropes. To pinpoint one thing that helps longevity at Augusta National it's putting. @TigerWoods was perfect today inside 10 feet.
Putting is about nerve & nerves. As long as Tiger has that under control, he can win at @TheMasters for next 10 yrs. Tiger's nerve is still pretty darn good!

Sure, ""Saturday Night Live"" was hosted by Emma Stone and took jabs at Michael Avenatti, Lori Loughlin, Julian Assange and ""The View"" -- but the spotlight belonged to the seven members of the boy band sensation. BTS! We haven't seen boy-band fandom like this since the Beatles BTS became the first Korean pop, or K-pop, group to perform on SNL. Korean pop music has been steadily growing in popularity. But BTS has elevated the genre into an international movement. The group's new album, ""Map of the Soul: Persona,"" is expected to smash sales charts.

People are again talking about slavery reparations. But it's a complex and thorny issue - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Doug Criss,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/14/politics/slavery-reparations-explainer-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) If you feel like you're hearing more about slavery reparations these days, it's not your imagination.
Compensating the descendants of American slaves is suddenly a hot topic on the campaign trail, with presidential candidates voicing support for slavery reparations. New proposals also seek financial redress for decades of legalized segregation and discrimination against African-Americans in employment, housing, health and education. But why now? And just how would reparations, focused specifically on slavery, work? Here's what you need to know about this most controversial of subjects. Why are reparations in the news? Read More The idea of giving black people reparations for slavery dates back to right after the end of the Civil War (think 40 acres and a mule ). For decades it's mostly been an idea debated outside the mainstream of American political thought. But writer Ta-Nehisi Coates reintroduced it to the mainstream with a piece, ""The Case for Reparations,"" in 2014 in The Atlantic. And now several Democratic presidential candidates, who need the votes and energy of liberal voters to succeed in the primaries, have said they support some form of reparations for slavery. Sen. Cory Booker this week introduced a bill that would establish a commission to study possible reparations. Sen. Kamala Harris recently told a radio show host that the idea of reparations should be considered in the face of economic inequality. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has spoken approvingly of the need for reparations for African-Americans, as well as for Native Americans whose land was seized by European settlers. So has former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro. How do you put a cash value on hundreds of years of forced servitude? This may be the most contested part. Academics, lawyers and activists have given it a shot, though, and their results vary. Most formulations have produced numbers from as low as $17 billion to as high as almost $5 trillion. -- The most often-quoted figure, though, is truly staggering, as anthropologist and author Jason Hickel notes in his 2018 book, ""The Divide: Global Inequality from Conquest to Free Markets"": ""It is estimated that the United States alone benefited from a total of 222,505,049 hours of forced labor between 1619 and the abolition of slavery in 1865. Valued at the US minimum wage, with a modest rate of interest, that is worth $97 trillion today."" Keep in mind, the total US federal budget for fiscal year 2018 was $4.1 trillion. -- Other formulations are more modest, like a 2015 report by University of Connecticut assistant professor Thomas Craemer. He estimated that the labor of slaves was worth at least $5.9 trillion and perhaps as much as $14.2 trillion (in 2009 dollars). Craemer came up with that figure by estimating the monetary value of slaves over time, the total number of hours they worked and the wages at which that work should have been compensated. Craemer's number is also lower because he only deals with the slavery that happened from the time of the country's founding until the end of the Civil War, so it ignores slavery during the colonial period and the discrimination that blacks endured during the Jim Crow era. Where would the money come from? Generally, advocates for reparations say that three different groups should pay for them: governments, private companies and rich families that owe a good portion of their wealth to slavery. It makes sense that federal and state governments (which enshrined, supported and protected the institution of slavery) and private businesses (which financially benefited from it), would be tempting targets from which reparations could be extracted. But wealthy families ? ""There are huge, wealthy families in the South today that once owned a lot of slaves. You can trace all their wealth to the free labor of black folks. So when you identify the defendants, there are a vast number of individuals,"" attorney Willie E. Gary told Harper's magazine in November 2000, during the height of the last, big time of reparations talk. Gray was talking about how these families could be sued for reparations since they benefited directly from slavery. As you might imagine, suing large groups of people to pay for reparations wouldn't go over well. Others have suggested lawmakers could pass legislation to force families to pay up. But that might not be constitutionally sound. ""I don't think you can legislate and have those families pay,"" Malik Edwards, a law professor at North Carolina Central University, told CNN. ""If you're going to go after individuals you'd have to come up with a theory to do it through litigation. At least on the federal level Congress doesn't have the power to go after these folks. It just doesn't fall within its Commerce Clause powers."" The Commerce Clause refers to the section of the US Constitution which gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states. But reparations mean more than a cash payout, right? It could. Reparations could come in the form of special social programs. It could mean giving away land. That's why people need to check the fine print on the support all of those Democratic presidential candidates have given to reparations. None of them have articulated a concrete proposal that would specifically give a cash benefit to black Americans. They've talked about developing tax credits that would go to all low-income people, not just blacks, and creating so-called ""baby bonds"" that would help all of America's children pay for college, not just African-American children. None of the major Democratic candidates so far have proposed making direct cash payments to African Americans as a way for the country to atone for its ""original sin,"" except for Marianne Williamson, who announced her candidacy in January. Williamson, a best-selling author and spiritual counselor to Oprah Winfrey, has advocated for reparations for years and proposes giving $100 billion in reparations for slavery, with $10 billion a year to be distributed over 10 years. Others have suggested a mix of cash and programs targeted to help African Americans. ""Direct benefits could include cash payments and subsidized home mortgages similar to those that built substantial white middle-class wealth after World War II, but targeted to those excluded or preyed upon by predatory lending,"" Chuck Collins, an author and a program director at the Institute for Policy Studies, told CNN. ""It could include free tuition and financial support at universities and colleges for first generation college students."" Reparation funds could also be used to provide one-time endowments to start museums and historical exhibits on slavery, Collins said. What are the arguments against reparations? There are many. Opponents of reparations argue that all the slaves are dead, no white person living today owned slaves or that all the immigrants that have come to America since the Civil War don't have anything to do with slavery. Also, not all black people living in America today are descendants of slaves (like former President Barack Obama). Others point out that slavery makes it almost impossible for most African-Americans to trace their lineage earlier than the Civil War, so how could they prove they descended from enslaved people? Writer David Frum noted those and other potential obstacles in a 2014 piece for The Atlantic entitled ""The Impossibility of Reparations,"" which was a counterpoint to Coates' essay. Frum warned that any reparations program would eventually be expanded to other groups, like Native Americans, and he feared that reparations could create their own brand of inequality. ""Within the target population, will all receive the same? Same per person, or same per family? Or will there be adjustment for need? How will need be measured?"" asks Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush. ""And if reparations were somehow delivered communally and collectively, disparities of wealth and power and political influence within black America will become even more urgent. Simply put, when government spends money on complex programs, the people who provide the service usually end up with much more sway over the spending than the spending's intended beneficiaries."" In a recent column for The Hill , conservative activist Bob Woodson decried the idea of reparations as ""yet another insult to black America that is clothed in the trappings of social justice."" He also told CNN he feels America made up for slavery long ago, so reparations aren't needed. ""I wish they could understand the futility of wasting time engaging in such a discussion when there are larger, more important challenges facing many in the black community,"" Woodson, the founder and president of the Woodson Center, told CNN. ""America atoned for the sin of slavery when they engaged in a civil war that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Let's for the sake of argument say every black person received $20,000. What would that accomplish?"" This isn't the first time reparations have come up, is it? After decades of languishing as something of a fringe idea, the call for reparations really caught steam in the late 1980s through the '90s. Former Democratic Rep. John Conyers first introduced a bill in 1989 to create a commission to study reparations. Known as HR 40 , Conyers repeatedly re-introduced the bill, which has never been passed, until he left office in 2017 . Texas Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee has taken up the baton, sponsoring HR 40 in this year's Congress. Activist groups, like the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America and the Restitution Study Group , sprang up during this period. Books, like Randall Robinson's ""The Debt: What America Owes to Blacks,"" gained huge buzz. Then came the lawsuit. In 2002 Deadria Farmer-Paellmann became the lead plaintiff in a federal class-action suit against a number of companies -- including banks, insurance company Aetna and railroad firm CSX -- seeking billions for reparations after Farmer-Paellmann linked the businesses to the slave trade. She got the idea for the lawsuit as she examined old Aetna insurance policies and documented the insurer's role in the 19th century in insuring slaves. The suit sought financial payments for the value of ""stolen"" labor and unjust enrichment and called for the companies to give up ""illicit profits."" ""These are corporations that benefited from stealing people, from stealing labor, from forced breeding, from torture, from committing numerous horrendous acts, and there's no reason why they should be able to hold onto assets they acquired through such horrendous acts,"" Farmer-Paellmann said at the time. The case was tossed out by a federal judge in 2005 because it was deemed that Farmer-Paellmann and the other plaintiffs didn't have legal standing in the case, meaning they couldn't prove a sufficient link to the corporations or prove how they were harmed. The judge also said the statute of limitations had long since passed. Appeals to the US 7th Circuit Court of Appeals and the US Supreme Court proved unsuccessful, and the push for reparations kind of petered out. But Coates' 2014 article in The Atlantic reignited interest in the issue. New reparations advocacy groups, like the United States Citizens Recovery Initiative Alliance Inc ., took up the fight. Black Lives Matter includes slavery reparations in its list of proposals to improve the economic lives of black Americans. Even a UN panel said the US should pay reparations. And now major candidates for president are endorsing the idea. So, what are the prospects of reparations moving forward? Despite the words of support from these Democratic presidential candidates, slavery reparations still face an uphill battle. The idea isn't popular with the American public. A 2016 Marist poll found that 68% of Americans don't think the US should pay reparations to the descendants of slaves. Unsurprisingly there's a racial divide to this. Some 81% of white Americans are against reparations, while 58% of African Americans support them. What is surprising is the generational divide the poll revealed. Millennials surveyed were much more likely than Baby Boomers or Gen-Xers to support reparations. Even still, a total of 49% of millennials opposed them. Those numbers make it difficult for any candidate to try to sell a skeptical American public on the idea and to get lawmakers to pass legislation. And after the failure in the courts of Farmer-Paellmann's lawsuit more than a decade ago, taking legal action to secure reparations doesn't seem like the most promising route either. Whatever happens, almost everyone agrees that something needs to be done to cut down the huge wealth gap between white and blacks that slavery helped created. Collins, the author and scholar, said his own research showed that the median wealth of a white household is $147,000, which is about 41 times greater than the median wealth of a black family, which is $3,600. ""This can only be explained through an understanding of the multigenerational legacy of white supremacy in asset building,"" he told CNN. ""People say, 'slavery was so long ago' or 'my family didn't own slaves.' But the key thing to understand is that the unpaid labor of millions -- and the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow laws, discrimination in mortgage lending and a race-based system of mass incarceration -- created uncompensated wealth for individuals and white society as a whole. Immigrants with European heritage directly and indirectly benefited from this system of white supremacy. The past is very much in the present."""
People are again talking about slavery reparations. But it's a complex and thorny issue - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Doug Criss,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/14/politics/slavery-reparations-explainer-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) If you feel like you're hearing more about slavery reparations these days, it's not your imagination.
Compensating the descendants of American slaves is suddenly a hot topic on the campaign trail, with presidential candidates voicing support for slavery reparations. New proposals also seek financial redress for decades of legalized segregation and discrimination against African-Americans in employment, housing, health and education. But why now? And just how would reparations, focused specifically on slavery, work? Here's what you need to know about this most controversial of subjects. Why are reparations in the news? Read More The idea of giving black people reparations for slavery dates back to right after the end of the Civil War (think 40 acres and a mule ). For decades it's mostly been an idea debated outside the mainstream of American political thought. But writer Ta-Nehisi Coates reintroduced it to the mainstream with a piece, ""The Case for Reparations,"" in 2014 in The Atlantic. And now several Democratic presidential candidates, who need the votes and energy of liberal voters to succeed in the primaries, have said they support some form of reparations for slavery. Sen. Cory Booker this week introduced a bill that would establish a commission to study possible reparations. Sen. Kamala Harris recently told a radio show host that the idea of reparations should be considered in the face of economic inequality. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has spoken approvingly of the need for reparations for African-Americans, as well as for Native Americans whose land was seized by European settlers.

Deadly tornadoes: 100 million people at risk as storm marches east - CNN,us.cnn.com,Judson Jones,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/14/us/severe-storms-wxc/index.html,"(CNN) The massive storm system that killed several people from Texas to Mississippi is now barreling east, threatening to spawn tornadoes and other catastrophic weather from New England to the Gulf Coast.
About 90 million people are under the gun for destructive weather Sunday, CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said. While Sunday's storms might not be as severe as the ones that battered the South on Saturday, they will hit far more people in heavily populated cities. ""New York, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta all within the zone,"" CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam said. At least one tornado was reported Sunday morning in southeast Alabama, near Troy and Goshen, the National Weather Service's Birmingham office said. Read More ""Heavy rainfall may hide this tornado. Do not wait to see or hear the tornado. Take cover now,"" the NWS office said. ""Flying debris will be dangerous to those caught without shelter. Mobile homes will be damaged or destroyed. Damage to roofs, windows, and vehicles will occur. Tree damage is likely."" The weather service also issued tornado watches Sunday evening for parts of Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina -- including Raleigh and Charlotte -- lasting through Sunday night. Some of the greatest threats include scattered tornadoes, wind gusts reaching 70 mph and hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter.

The threat of severe weather will likely increase throughout the day, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said. ""Some storms may also produce large hail or torrential downpours resulting in localized flash flooding,"" the weather service tweeted. Robert and Marion Murphy inspect their damaged shop after a possible tornado struck western Mississippi. Portions of Chicago saw some snow and while it began slowing down Sunday afternoon, the weather service said snow-covered surfaces may pile up to an inch of snow. 8 deaths include 3 children The storm system's death toll rose to at least eight on Sunday. In Alabama, the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office reported on Sunday that a county worker had died in a hospital after being hit by a vehicle near Hueytown. Jefferson County Captain David Agee told CNN affiliate WBRC that the worker was removing a tree for Jefferson County Roads and Transportation when he was struck. Earlier Sunday authorities reported the death of a Texas woman whose mobile home was destroyed Saturday night. Severe weather, including a possible tornado, pummeled the Texas city of Alto on Saturday. Four other people were injured when the trailer was struck, Houston County Emergency Management Coordinator Roger Dickey said. The storm system's first two victims were two children in east Texas. The children, ages 3 and 8, were killed when a tree fell on a car Saturday. They were in the back seat with their parents in the front, Angelina County Sheriff's Department Capt. Alton Lenderman said. The Alto Police Department also confirmed a woman who was injured last night at Caddo Mounds has died. At least 25 people were injured in the area and were transported to hospitals. A preliminary damage survey showed an EF-3 tornado, with winds up to 140 mph, touched down in Robertson County, the NWS in Fort Worth said. CNN affiliate KWTX reported widespread damage in the Robertson County town of Franklin, including uprooted trees and roofs ripped off buildings. A storm that struck Franklin, Texas, yanked trees out of the ground. The entire town of Franklin and neighboring Bremond lost electricity, with 3,088 customers without power early Sunday. The Franklin Independent School District announced school would be closed Monday until power is restored. Due to the devastation of Franklin by Saturday's tornado and the uncertainty of available electrical power FISD will not hold school Monday. We will work close with the power companies to stay informed on when power will be restored to make a decision for the following day.
— Franklin ISD (@FranklinISD) April 14, 2019 About two hours north of Franklin, dime-sized hail pelted the Dallas-Fort Worth area. And the Dallas suburb of The Colony was pounded by baseball-sized hail. The rash of storms then headed east, where it claimed the life of a Louisiana teen. The 13-year-old boy drowned in a drainage area in West Monroe late Saturday afternoon, the Ouachita Parish Sheriff's Office said. The death is believed to be storm related, the sheriff's office said. The sheriff's office also reported a second death after responding to a vehicle submerged in floodwater with a victim inside. The accident is still being investigated and the identity of the victim has not been released. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant said during a press conference Sunday there was one storm-related fatality. Nine people were taken to emergency rooms across the state, four of whom were admitted to the hospital. A pine tree lies across what remains of a trailer on Center Hill Road outside of Hamilton, Miss., after a deadly storm moved through the area Sunday, April 14, 2019. The death was in Monroe County, Mississippi Emergency Management Agency Director Greg Michel said. Bryant signed a declaration of emergency for the affected areas, and said there were 26,000 power outages Sunday and 28 mostly rural roads remained closed due to flooding.

Monroe County will also have a curfew from 8 p.m. Sunday to 6 a.m. Monday. 'We are just a mess' Warm air enhanced the atmosphere's instability Saturday, allowing the storm system to rev up more energy and grow, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. As the storms tore through Mississippi overnight into Sunday, they left a trail of destruction that authorities are still combing through. The fire station in Hamilton was destroyed, as were multiple homes and a retail center. Debris at a strip mall Saturday following the severe weather in Vicksburg, Mississsippi. ""It looks like a storm came up through Louisiana and into Mississippi and exploded in Monroe County,"" Monroe County Sheriff Cecil Cantrell said. ""We were hit really, really, hard. We have a lot of flooding. There are several trees down. We are just a mess.""

BTS performed on 'SNL' and fans went crazy - CNN,us.cnn.com,Amir Vera,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/14/us/bts-snl-performance/index.html,"(CNN) This week's ""SNL"" was all about BTS.
Sure, ""Saturday Night Live"" was hosted by Emma Stone and took jabs at Michael Avenatti, Lori Loughlin, Julian Assange and ""The View"" -- but the spotlight belonged to the seven members of the boy band sensation. BTS became the first Korean pop, or K-pop, group to perform on SNL. Korean pop music has been steadily growing in popularity. But BTS has elevated the genre into an international movement. The group's new album, ""Map of the Soul: Persona,"" is expected to smash sales charts. The group's high-energy dance moves and pitch-perfect vocals as they performed ""Boy With Luv"" and ""Mic Drop,"" drew screams and applause from the ""SNL"" audience and lit up social media. Read More Their fans, collectively known as ARMY , were in full force on Twitter and Instagram during the band's two performances. ""My daughter is making really weird mouth noises watching #BTSxSNL and just had to take her hoodie off because she's sweating. It's a #BTSARMY thing for those not aware,"" said radio host JJ Ryan.

Indian elections: A new board game shows the sleazier side of the campaign,us.cnn.com,"Manveena Suri, CNN",04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/india/india-election-game-intl/index.html,"New Delhi (CNN) Staging a mass rally. Spreading fake news. Fueling caste tensions. Playing the religion card.
These are among the more unsavory tactics that have allegedly been used by some Indian political parties as they scramble for votes during election season. Now, with the country of 1.3 billion people embarking once again on the world's biggest democratic exercise , a new board game is simulating something of that campaign process -- offering players both the standard and the sleazier electoral strategies. The Poll: The Great Indian Election Game is the brainchild of 27-year-old journalist Abeer Kapoor, who came up with the idea in 2017 after covering national and state elections. Abeer Kapoor with the board game he invented that was inspired by India's political system. ""I started thinking about how parties are like players where they have a set of fixed resources like money, feet on the ground, party workers, ideologies and the media and other institutions. But the terrain, the state constituencies, are different,"" said Kapoor. Read More ""So, it's like a game, and we should be able to simulate that in a way that breaks the barrier between people and politics. We want people to understand the process."" The game has also provided Kapoor with a unique insight into Indian voters and their political preferences. The Westminster system India is a former British colony, and its political system follows the Westminster model. Parties field candidates for seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, and whichever party wins a majority of seats gets to choose the prime minister. Across 543 constituencies , candidates will vie for votes from an electorate numbering 900 million, nearly triple the population of the United States. The board game, three to four people, each of whom represents a political party and creates a manifesto by choosing ""policy cards"" which he or she must defend. Jargon has been lifted from real party manifestos and definitions taken from high school textbooks, since one of Kapoor's goals is to educate players in the process -- warts and all. ""I realized early on that if I built an ideal situation that did not mimic an Indian election, there would be a huge cognitive dissonance when people encounter (actual) elections,"" said Kapoor. With money, media strategies and manifestos, the game sets out to recreate the process of India's elections. A player who manages to convince opponents their strategy will work places cubes on top of a constituency card. Players use both financial resources and campaign strategies as they battle for influence. The game, Kapoor said, does not offer lessons about the morality of politics. ""We want people to understand the process of an election, that there are issues and there are promises that are made and we don't always hold people accountable for that,"" he said. With #Elections2019 around the corner we are in RD&SH National College Mumbai thanks to @Prajafoundation and @FNFSouthAsia and got a 35 kids to play the game! pic.twitter.com/vwGFxXymX0
— The Poll Game (@poll_game) February 27, 2019 The influences behind political beliefs The game, which is available in Hindi and English, was launched in January, and Kapoor has been traveling the country to promote it. Along the way, he's noticed that the way people play it reflects their background and experiences of politics. ""We found that in an urban metropolis like Delhi, we aren't talking to each other about politics. So, you see that apprehension, you see more rigidity built in to the way that people want to see the world. The echo chambers become extremely visible in urban settings,"" said Kapoor. Constituency cards provide details of the geography and demographics of a district, along with how many seats it accounts for and the main issues at stake. ""If you move away from that to kids coming from more disadvantaged backgrounds in Mumbai, you see a lot more negotiation. This is their life, negotiating with the state. They're far more argumentative and comfortable with the idea of discussing the issues that matter."" In Lucknow, a city in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, some participants established a game on the side. ""In Uttar Pradesh, which is the hub of Indian politics, you see there's a casualness built in to corruption. One part of the game is where people argue to keep their constituencies, but by the end of it they were just trading money. They saw money on the board, and they didn't care about the arguments,"" said Kapoor. Poll predictions The real-life game kicked off on April 11. Because polling a country of this size is such a mammoth task, the voting will take place in phases across the country which will end on May 19. The winner will be announced on May 23. The ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party is being challenged by a coalition led by the secular Congress Party . Players choose a number of policy cards that will form the foundation of their manifesto. Having traveled the country during election season, does Kapoor have any predictions? ""We know what party people support by the manifesto and policy cards they pick. What I see is that this election is wide open. There are enough snarky comments made on the lack of delivery of this government and there are enough people who will stand up for it,"" said Kapoor. ""If anyone thinks this election is done and dusted on either side, it's too soon to call. It's going to be a very interesting election."""
Brexit battles are about to get bloodier,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Luke McGee,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/uk/brexit-luke-mcgee-analysis-intl-gbr/index.html,"London (CNN) On Friday, the United Kingdom missed its second Brexit deadline. By accepting the European Union's offer to remain until October 31, Theresa May all but guaranteed that the UK, which voted to leave the EU nearly three years ago, will participate in the European parliamentary elections next month .
The UK's inability to leave the EU on time is already impacting British and European politics. On the same day that Brexit didn't happen (for the second time), Nigel Farage, the former leader of the anti-EU UKIP, launched his new political movement, the Brexit Party. Theresa May defends Brexit delay amid calls to resign Farage, a Member of the European Parliament since 1999, says his party would target voters across the political spectrum who have been ""betrayed"" by the political class. He is placing a £1,000 ($1,300) bet on the Brexit Party winning the European elections and says that there will be ""no more Mr. Nice Guy"" on the campaign battlefield. Farage knows a thing or two about European elections. In 2014, he led his former party to victory in the UK. European elections have notoriously low turnout, which can work in the favor of more radical politicians chasing the protest vote. In 2014, this meant UKIP, a party without a single seat in the UK Parliament, sent more MEPs to Brussels than any mainstream party. Read More This time, Farage will be able to use the single most divisive issue in the country to his advantage. Even if his party isn't as successful as he hopes, it's likely that a large chunk of the MEPs the UK sends will be euroskeptic. This should worry the EU. As a full member state, the UK will have voting rights and be able to frustrate the EU's plans as long as it remains inside the bloc. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative MP and leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, says this belligerent behavior is entirely justifiable and necessary. ""The EU has not been sincerely cooperative during the Brexit process, so I don't think we owe a duty of cooperation to the EU in return,"" Rees-Mogg said. The EU has not been sincerely cooperative during the Brexit process, so I don't think we owe a duty of cooperation to the EU in return.
Jacob Rees-Mogg
""If we do send euroskeptic MEPs to Brussels, I don't expect them to cooperate with federalist EU schemes and they should block any attempts to increase the EU's budget."" This uncomfortable reality is dawning on Europeans. Marietje Schaake, a liberal member of the European Parliament, says key decisions will be made before October, including the election of a new EU Commission President. ""MEPs from the UK would have a vote on those. Similarly, the Brexit party will undoubtedly use every opportunity it has to negatively impact the EU, thereby clearly proving that contrary to its slogans, a seat at the table gives more influence than stepping away from it,"" Schaake said. The Brexit failure is also affecting domestic politics in London. Having spent two years trying to get both hardline Brexiteer members of her own party and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party on board with her plans, May last week gave up and started negotiating with the opposition Labour Party. With both camps so divided on the Brexit question, any compromise would lead to chaos among both parties' MPs. Some Labour MPs want Corbyn to push for a second referendum, meaning that they will approve May's deal, but on the condition that a public vote is then held. Even on that question, there is division on whether that vote should include the option to scrap Brexit altogether. Labour's official Brexit position is that the UK remains in a permanent customs union with the EU. That wouldn't only infuriate Conservative backbenchers, but members of May's government. Liam Fox, the UK's trade secretary, wrote that a customs union would leave the UK ""stuck in the worst of both worlds, not only unable to set our international trade policy but subject, without representation, to the policy of an entity over which MPs would have no democratic control."" It would also be unpopular among leave-supporting Labour MPs. Kate Hoey, a Labour MP who campaigned for Brexit, says ""any Labour government that signs up to the customs union would not be able to deliver radical policies like using state aid or nationalization. I do not see any customs union compromise that doesn't break the promises in either parties' 2017 manifestos."" Few in London expect the talks between the two parties to go anywhere. May has already said that if her deal passes, she will resign, thus cementing her political legacy as the prime minister that managed to take the UK out of the EU. But eager as she might be to see Brexit off once and for all, doing so at the cost of leaving her party a divided mess would be rash. Add to this the fact that the Labour Party can smell blood and has been in campaign mode for months. Why would it suddenly risk its credibility by bailing out a weak, Conservative government in May's final days as leader? JUST WATCHED Here's what you need to know about Brexit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Here's what you need to know about Brexit 03:19 While ex-UKIP leader Farage and others might still be hopeful of a pure, clean Brexit, the impasse has also lit a fire under Remain factions in the UK. ""It's April 29 and Britain hasn't left the European Union. Brexit is defeating itself,"" Wes Streeting, a pro-EU Labour MP told me earlier this week. He says the campaign for a second referendum is in a far stronger position than many believed it ever could be. ""The PM has tried stoically to deliver on the outcome of the referendum, but she's found it impossible to deliver on the promises that were made to people during the referendum."" In Brussels, European diplomats and EU officials have been discussing the growing sense that Brexit might be evaporating. It's a view shared by the group campaigning for a second referendum. Tom Brufatto, head of campaigns for the People's Vote, thinks that getting past March 29 was a ""sigh of relief for a majority of people in the UK. The risk of no deal on a fixed date was causing a lot of anxiety of stress."" It provided Remain supporters with solid proof that leaving the EU was not the inevitable conclusion of this process. I think there will be a mobilization of voters who want to take part in what will be the most important and high-profile election in the history of the European Union
Tom Brufatto
""The extension was seen as a beacon hope,"" he said. ""I think there will be a mobilization of voters who want to take part in what will be the most important and high-profile election in the history of the European Union."" The truth is that UK parliament's failure to agree on any Brexit outcome, combined with the EU's reluctance to kick the UK out, has left all options on the table. And the fact that there is no majority for anything in the House of Commons, while frustrating the Brexit process, means that whoever manages to break the deadlock first will likely win the day. Whether that's hardline Brexiteers forcing May out of office and replacing her with a firebreather, Remainers getting a second referendum or May pulling off the impossible and striking a deal with Labour is anyone's guess. The EU has given Britain breathing space to sort itself out. Its attempt to restore some semblance of calm to the Brexit process could lead to some of the bloodiest political battles yet."

Severe weather, including a possible tornado, pummeled the Texas city of Alto on Saturday. Four other people were injured when the trailer was struck, Houston County Emergency Management Coordinator Roger Dickey said. The storm system's first two victims were two children in east Texas. The children, ages 3 and 8, were killed when a tree fell on a car Saturday. They were in the back seat with their parents in the front, Angelina County Sheriff's Department Capt. Alton Lenderman said. The Alto Police Department also confirmed a woman who was injured last night at Caddo Mounds has died. At least 25 people were injured in the area and were transported to hospitals.

On April 13, 1919, British troops fired without warning on a peaceful protest of thousands of unarmed Indians in Amritsar, Punjab, in what became alternately known as the Amritsar or the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. While the number of those killed is disputed between British and Indian authorities, a report by a British-led committee following the massacre put the number of victims at close to 400, with three to four times as many people injured. Indian observers said more than 1,000 people lost their lives. Rahul Gandhi, the president of the India National Congress, the main opposition party, was joined at the site of the massacre by Punjab State Chief, Captain Amarinder Singh , to lay a floral wreath to victims.

He is the author of ""Breaking News: The Remaking of Journalism and Why It Matters Now."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
(CNN) Once upon a time the ethical debates around journalism were comparatively simple -- beginning with the most basic question of all: Who is a journalist?
But here in 2019, nothing about Julian Assange is simple. Looking like a befuddled Old Testament prophet, the WikiLeaks founder was dragged out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London on Thursday to a new form of captivity -- and to challenge journalists around the world as to whether he is a hero deserving their support, or a villain for whom few would weep tears if he spent the rest of his life in a jail cell. Why the polarized differences? Assange's story is an extraordinary one. He started out as an obscure and anonymous hacker, and became one of the most talked-about people in the world -- at once reviled, celebrated and lionized; sought-after, imprisoned, self-exiled and shunned. Alan Rusbridger He had been catapulted from the obscurity of a life dribbling out leaks that nobody much noticed, to publishing a flood of classified documents that went to the heart of America's military and foreign policy operations -- even playing a controversial, some say decisive, role in the 2016 US presidential election. Read More From being a marginal figure invited to join panels at geeky tech conferences he was suddenly America's public enemy number one. If this wasn't dramatic enough, in the middle of it all, two women in Sweden came forward with allegations of sex crimes, which he has denied: One accused him of sexual assault and the other of rape. The media and public were torn between those who saw Assange as a new kind of cyber-messiah and those who regarded him as something akin to a James Bond villain. But -- despite the tensions and the shouting matches and the disappearances and the threats and the silences -- he briefly helped collaborate with the Guardian and New York Times to produce some rather important reporting. As Sarah Ellison's Vanity Fair piece on the Iraq and diplomatic cables disclosures concluded: ""Whatever the differences, the results have been extraordinary. Given the range, depth, and accuracy of the leaks, the collaboration produced by any standard one of the greatest journalistic scoops of the last 30 years."" JUST WATCHED Who is Julian Assange?
Who is Julian Assange? 01:39 So is Assange really a journalist? The answer in 2019 is a complicated one. New technologies allow millions of people to commit individual acts of journalism. That may not make them ""journalists"" in a conventional sense, but it does raise the question of whether these journalistic acts deserve the same sort of protection as those carried out by people who have had more traditional careers in journalism. To my mind, Assange is partly a journalist. Part of what he does has involved the selection, editing, verifying and contextualizing of news material -- just as any journalist would do. But Assange is also a publisher, a political activist, a hacker, an information anarchist, a player. Yes, he believes -- sometimes -- in editing. But he also believes in dumping vast oceans of documents, unedited and unredacted, careless to the consequences. One is journalism, the other isn't. Things become still more complicated if -- and it's a big ""if"" because we don't know the whole truth -- Assange subsequently allowed himself to become the conduit for material stolen by one foreign power to destabilize another: The release of thousands of emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee and published at the height of the 2016 presidential campaign. It prompted the man who would become President of the United States to declare: ""I love WikiLeaks!"" JUST WATCHED 'I know nothing about WikiLeaks,' claims Donald Trump
'I know nothing about WikiLeaks,' claims Donald Trump 04:18 On the basis of the US extradition request to the British government, the charges against Assange are currently rather thin. He is accused of pushing his source, Chelsea Manning, to come up with still more documents around 2010. Well, many journalists might put their hands up and say they've done the same. Next he's accused of trying to help Manning conceal her identity on various official computer systems as she roamed around for more documents to download and leak. Is this a sinister sign of Assange trying to hack secret systems (though the indictment doesn't use the word ""hack"")? Or is it what any decent journalist would do: Try to protect their sources from detection? We won't know the answers to these questions until the case comes to court in the US -- a process that could well take months, if not years. The US authorities could come up with more ammunition as the case proceeds. But -- on the basis of what we know so far -- it is not clear that Assange is being accused of behaving in ways that respected Pulitzer Prize winning journalists would disavow. His case is not a simple one. But disliking Assange shouldn't be the same as disowning him."

View more opinion at CNN.
(CNN) As we wait for Attorney General William Barr to release a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's confidential report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, it's worth asking: how did we arrive at this moment? Why, unlike the reports of previous independent counsels, is Mueller's unredacted report not being provided to Congress or the American people?
Michael Zeldin And, now that we are facing the inevitable fight that will ensue between Congress and the Department of Justice for full access to Mueller's report, how can we avoid a similar situation in the future? My answer: It is time to bring back the Independent Counsel statute. How we got here In 1978, as part of the post-Watergate reform package known as the Ethics in Government Act , Congress passed the Independent Counsel Act. The statute was intended to remove the inherent conflict of interest that could arise when the Justice Department was investigating the President and other top Executive Branch officials. Read More In June 1999, Congress, in response to Independent Counsel Ken Starr's detailed, and what some considered unnecessarily salacious, report to the House Judiciary Committee of his investigation into President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, allowed the law to expire. In its place, the Justice Department drafted Special Counsel regulations. These are the rules that govern Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Barr is doing exactly what he came to do: Protect Trump The regulations were intended to provide a sensible solution to the perceived problems of the Independent Counsel's obligation to file a final public report. Specifically, there was a concern that public reporting both could provide an incentive for the Independent Counsel to over-investigate matters and could potentially harm the privacy interests of individuals who were not charged with criminal wrongdoing. While this approach may have seemed sensible at the time, it has created the current predicament relating to the report's release. This is because there is nothing in the Special Counsel regulations that requires Mueller's unredacted report to be submitted to Congress or released to the American public. Attorney General Barr confirmed this when asked during Tuesday's House Appropriations Committee hearing whether he would release the entire, unredacted Mueller report to Congress. He replied that he lacked the legal authority to do so, saying, ""You will recognize that I'm operating under a regulation that was put together during the Clinton administration and does not provide for the publication of the report."" Where do we need to go? With no regulatory mechanism that authorizes the release of the full report and with a separation of powers fight brewing, the time is right to bring back the Independent Counsel statute. This law addressed many problems revealed by the current Special Counsel regulations, including: 1. The Independent Counsel law provided a mechanism to release the Independent Counsel's report. Under the Independent Counsel law , the final report was provided to the Court. The Court had the power to release the full report or any portions of the report to the public. By contrast, the Special Counsel regulations provide a very limited reporting mechanism , and leave the decision whether to release any portion of the final report within the sole discretion of the Attorney General. 2. The Independent Counsel statute created a role for Congressional oversight. Under the Independent Counsel law, Congress was granted oversight jurisdiction of the Independent Counsel. The Special Counsel regulations do not provide any Congressional oversight of the Independent Counsel investigating the President for potential criminal wrongdoing or for abuse of office considerations. 3. The law established a mechanism to transmit evidence worthy of an impeachment inquiry. Barr overstepped his authority and undermined the integrity of the Mueller investigation Under the Independent Counsel law, the Independent Counsel was required to advise the House of Representatives of any substantial and credible evidence that may constitute grounds for an impeachment. The Special Counsel regulations do not have a specific provision under which the Special Counsel transmits to the House of Representatives any evidence that might provide a sufficient basis for initiating an impeachment inquiry. 4. The statute provided a way for people named in the final report to respond. Under the Independent Counsel law , the court could permit individuals named in the final report to see portions of the report so that they could submit comments or clarify factual information. The comments could be included in an appendix to the report, at the court's discretion. This provided a way for individuals to address any concerns about harm to one's reputation in a meaningful way. The Special Counsel regulations do not provide a way for individuals mentioned in the Special Counsel's final report to respond to the Special Counsel's findings or conclusions. 5. The Independent Counsel law provided a means for subjects of the investigation who are not charged with a crime to be reimbursed for reasonable attorney's fees. Under the Independent Counsel law, uncharged subjects of the investigation could request that the court award reasonable attorney's fees. Under the Special Counsel regulations, uncharged subjects of the Special Counsel's investigation bear the financial burden of their own defense. 6. The Independent Counsel statute ensured that only the Attorney General could remove an independent counsel and only for good cause. Why America may not get the answers it seeks from Mueller Under the Independent Counsel law, only the Attorney General could fire an Independent Counsel and, then, only for cause shown. Because the law was enacted by Congress, the President could not change the law unilaterally. Under the Special Counsel regulations, only the Attorney General can remove a Special Counsel for good cause shown. But, because the Special Counsel regulations are executive branch regulations, the President can rescind or modify them unilaterally, thereby allowing him to fire the Independent Counsel at will. 7. The Independent Counsel statute allowed a fired independent counsel to obtain judicial review. Under the Independent Counsel law, an Independent Counsel who was removed from office could obtain judicial review by the court to determine if his/her removal was improper. The regulations do not provide a mechanism for a fired Special Counsel to contest his/her dismissal. 8. The statute assured that the Independent Counsel had full power and independent authority. The Independent Counsel law vested the Independent Counsel with much greater authority and discretion. Under the statute, the Independent Counsel was provided with full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions and powers of the Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and any other officer or employee of the Department of Justice. At the same time, the law encouraged the Independent Counsel to confer with and adhere to Justice Department practices, whenever possible. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

The Special Counsel regulations provide the Justice Department with significant oversight of the Special Counsel. Under the regulations, the Attorney General can ask the Special Counsel to provide an explanation for any investigative or prosecutorial step and, after review, the Attorney General can conclude that an action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued by the Special Counsel. The remedy While the Independent Counsel law was imperfectly applied in some cases (and the current Special Counsel regulations were a good faith attempt to address those imperfections), the Independent Counsel statute seems a whole lot better than what we have today. Using the old Independent Counsel law as a guide, Congress should remedy this problem by passing a new Independent Counsel statute."
"Don't underestimate Kim Kardashian, Esq. (opinion)",us.cnn.com,Holly Thomas,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/opinions/kim-kardashian-turns-to-law-thomas/index.html,"Holly Thomas is a writer and editor based in London. She tweets @HolstaT . solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.
(CNN) ""First year of law school,"" Kim Kardashian West told US Vogue in her May cover interview, ""you have to cover three subjects: criminal law, torts, and contracts."" (For the record, there are a few others, too, including constitutional law and civil procedure). For Kardashian, ""Torts is the most confusing, contracts the most boring, and crim law I can do in my sleep. Took my first test, I got a 100. Super easy for me.""
Holly Thomas Kardashian announced this week in the same interview that she began a four-year apprenticeship with a law firm in San Francisco last summer and wants to take the California bar exam in 2022. (She is not enrolled in law school. Under California law, aspiring lawyers can undertake an apprenticeship and if they pass the bar exam, they can practice law -- even without a law school degree). The reality superstar's pivot to becoming a lawyer — apparently motivated by her stated desire to do more to improve the criminal justice system, ""to fight to fix it,"" -- has prompted a mixed response. Many have predictably derided the move as idiotic, telling her to stay in her lane. Others have called the criticism sexist, highlighting the obvious comparison between Kardashian and Reese Witherspoon's character in the 2001 movie ""Legally Blonde,"" Elle Woods -- also initially dismissed in her law school efforts because of her looks and past persona. The bottom line is this: Kardashian is inspiring for choosing a new path as a 38-year-old mother of three — and she is also the nauseatingly privileged proof that in today's America, no option is off-limits for the very wealthy. In many ways, this is the most interesting thing Kim Kardashian West has ever done. And it says a lot about the susceptibility of the public and press to her carefully-constructed image that so few saw this coming. Read More Why Kim Kardashian wanted President Trump to free me There are some obvious ways in which this path makes sense for Kardashian. Her father, Robert Kardashian, was a well-known lawyer, part of OJ Simpson's defense team. She has already demonstrated an interest in the law, making herself heard on criminal justice issues and playing a significant part last year in President Trump's release of Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old woman who'd been in an Alabama prison on a nonviolent drug charge since 1996. Meeting with Trump, alongside CNN commentator and activist Van Jones, plus several lawyers, Kardashian West helped persuade the President with a force of argument Jones described as ""the most effective, emotionally intelligent intervention that I've ever seen in American politics."" She has also worked for months with #cut50, a bipartisan advocacy group aiming to reform the criminal-justice system. Compared with some of her other ventures -- advertising dangerous slimming teas to her legions of young female fans, for example -- this looks not just like a step in a far more positive direction, but a break from the brand the Kardashian family has built over the years. The Kardashians are described in public discourse variously as mercenary, feminist, impressive, groundbreaking, and sickeningly superficial. There are strong arguments to be made for every case, but despite so many opposing characteristics, they tend to be referred to as a monolith -- not individuals so much as component parts of a vast, unprecedented money machine. Britney Spears is taking care of herself. Too many others can't Kim Kardashian, for years the most famous member of her family, was somehow the most Kardashian. She was the most polished, the most bankable (until sister Kylie Jenner's ascent), almost inhumanly adapted to the constant whirl of 5 a.m. workouts, three-hour makeup sessions, photo shoots and paparazzi that the machine demanded. She leaned in to the living doll persona, which the media so eagerly bestowed upon her, and as a result, many now have difficulty imagining her as anything but that. Throughout 16 seasons of the reality show that made her family world-famous, Kim's demeanor has scarcely changed. A couple of upsetting instances aside, she has remained placid throughout, more prone to asking questions than volunteering confidences herself. When emotions ran high as Caitlin Jenner went public with her transition, Kim was often the mediator, allowing everyone their say, but intervening to defuse tense conversations when necessary. In a way, it is her predictability that makes Kim Kardashian such comforting television. With her, you always know what you're getting. In retrospect, some of those considered responses signpost a personality that could be mesh with a career in law. Why we're celebrating a three-month-old law When in 2017, Kardashian described the process of identifying the men who robbed her at gunpoint in her Paris hotel room in October 2016, she was matter of fact. She itemized events without adding color or emotion, even noting that the men who had attacked her were 'pretty honest' in their recall of that night. Her most revealing comment was that it was ""interesting"" to know that they had been following her for over a year. She added that she was ""thankful"" for the experience, as it had afforded her ""all the background info'""she needed on how she could protect herself in future. Her recent foray into criminal justice also isn't the first time that digging below her contoured surface has revealed unexpected depths. Following the Parkland shooting last year, she tweeted to urge Congress to do its job and ""protect Americans from senseless gun violence."" She also took to Twitter in 2015 to denounce lax gun laws, after David Conley bought a gun online to kill his ex-girlfriend, her husband, and her six children, including his own son (she tweeted, ""Does this not sicken you?""). She did so again after the 2017 Las Vegas music festival shooting to share an image denouncing high capacity firearms as inconsistent with the Second Amendment. Every time she has spoken out on gun laws, Kim has been met with derogatory remarks such as, ""Stick to selfies."" But she has backed up her tweets. In 2016, she met with gun violence survivors from Sandy Hook and San Bernardino. For several years, she's been a creative council member of the organization Everytown For Gun Safety, which is dedicated to gun safety and fighting for legislative reform. In 2017, she recognized National Gun Violence Awareness Day by speaking out against a bill signed by Trump that revoked an Obama-era regulation. She may not always broadcast it, but Kim Kardashian does her homework. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

As far as her metamorphosis from reality star into woke lawyer goes, the proof will be in the pudding. If her previous activities -- not to mention the acquisitive tendencies of her mother, Kris Jenner -- are any indication, within the next decade we will see a Kardashian law firm, capitalizing on the family name but well-stocked with qualified lawyers to ensure it goes the distance (and makes as much money as possible). For now though, as a woman whose career thus far has been fed by sex appeal and social media, Kardashian's move is a bold one, picking a direction that demands a completely different skill set, and flies in the face of expectations. When asked by Vogue what she will be remembered for, she replied aptly, ""For my many talents."""
Pelosi and Hoyer: It's been a busy 100 days for House Democrats (Opinion),us.cnn.com,Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer,04-12-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/opinions/first-100-days-opinion-pelosi-hoyer/index.html,"Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, is a US representative from California and the speaker of the House of Representatives. Steny Hoyer, a Democrat, is a US representative from Maryland and the House majority leader. are their own; view more opinions on CNN.
(CNN) In November, the American people elected Democrats to take back the reins of power in the House of Representatives and put it back to work on their behalf. In our first 100 days in the majority, we have begun to deliver on that promise. With a dynamic, diverse and energized freshman class of 63 new members , Democrats are moving ahead with our agenda for the people: Lower health care costs and the price of prescription drugs, increase paychecks by rebuilding the infrastructure of America in a green, modern and job-creating way, and clean up corruption in Washington so that the government works for the public interest, not the special interests.
Nancy Pelosi Steny Hoyer One of the first acts of our new majority was to enable the House to defend the Affordable Care Act in court against efforts by Republican-led states and the Trump administration to dismantle it. This was soon followed by the introduction of a comprehensive bill to stabilize our health care system and lower health care costs for consumers. Already, committees are holding hearings and marking up legislation to keep Democrats' promises to take action to make health care and prescription drugs cheaper. To address wage stagnation, we passed H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act, in March. This legislation, led by Rep. Rosa DeLauro, makes it harder to discriminate against women in pay and benefits. With women now the sole breadwinner or co-breadwinner in two-thirds of families with children, closing the gender wage gap is an issue of both fairness and economic opportunity across our country. Meanwhile, Chairman Bobby Scott and Education and Labor Committee Democrats introduced the Raise the Wage Act in January, and it has already been marked up and received committee approval. This bill, which aims to increase the minimum wage eventually to $15 an hour, will be considered on the House floor in the coming months. In the first days of the 116th Congress, House Democrats moved swiftly to implement new rules to make the legislative process more open and transparent and hold elected officials to higher ethics standards. In the weeks that followed, led by Rep. John Sarbanes and many of our freshmen, Democrats passed H.R. 1, the For the People Act . Read More This major legislation puts power back into the people's hands by ending the unrestricted influence of big money in our politics, promoting national redistricting reform, and requiring new standards of transparency from those who serve in government. The legislation also broadens access to the ballot box, with automatic voter registration and expanded early voting. In February, Rep. Terri Sewell led Democrats in introducing H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019 , to restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court had undermined in 2013's Shelby v. Holder ruling . We are holding hearings and working to advance that legislation as well. How Democrats can steal the spotlight from Trump The Bipartisan Background Checks Act closes loopholes and requires that everyone who wishes to purchase a dangerous firearm does so only after passing a background check -- a requirement supported by nine out of 10 Americans, including a majority of responsible gun owners. We also passed Majority Whip Jim Clyburn's legislation to fix the dangerous Charleston loophole that currently allows the sale of a firearm to proceed if an FBI background check on the purchaser has not been completed within three days. Led by Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raul Grijalva, House Democrats reached across the aisle as well to pass a permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund to protect America's public lands. Furthermore, Democrats brought legislation written by Rep. Jimmy Panetta to reaffirm our support for the NATO alliance and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler's resolution to demand that the Justice Department make special counsel Robert Mueller's report public to the floor. Both passed with overwhelming bipartisan votes. These achievements alone would make the first 100 days of the new Democratic majority among the most productive in Congress' history. But the list runs even longer. Just last week, the House approved Rep. Karen Bass' five-year reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act with bipartisan support. Moreover, Democrats have introduced legislation or held hearings in our first 100 days to address critical challenges the previous Republican House majority ignored. These include: protecting Dreamers and those with Temporary Protected or Deferred Enforced Departure status and keeping immigrant families together; addressing the danger posed by climate change; and banning discrimination against LGBT Americans.

At the same time, Democrats are advancing great progress on our critical priority of rebuilding America's crumbling infrastructure. We are advancing legislation to invest in our rundown roads, bridges and transit systems; modernize our ports and airports; reconstruct our aging public housing; bring broadband internet to every corner of the country; and build the sustainable, resilient energy infrastructure of the future in a way that creates good-paying jobs and combats the climate crisis . The American people entrusted Democrats with the House majority because we promised to focus on the issues that matter and the challenges too great to be ignored. This is the positive change that the American people voted for in November, and many of our initiatives passed with bipartisan support. It's time for Senate Republicans to join us or pay a price with the public for their obstruction. House Democrats have taken action for the people. This is what we've done in our first 100 days. It is what we will continue to do in the weeks and months ahead."
The vicious White House sanctuary city revenge plan is too awful to gloss over (opinion),us.cnn.com,Bill Carter,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/12/opinions/trump-sanctuary-cities-immigration-revenge-plan-carter/index.html,"Bill Carter, a media analyst for CNN, covered the television industry for The New York Times for 25 years, and has written four books on TV, including ""The Late Shift"" and ""The War for Late Night."" are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
(CNN) The story broke in the Washington Post after 8 p.m. Thursday: The Trump administration, in its latest spasm of anti-immigrant animus, had twice in recent months considered a plan to transport detainees to sanctuary cities and essentially dump them there as a form of retaliation against Democratic political adversaries, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. By Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump confirmed that he was considering this revenge plan.
Bill Carter The reaction across a broad swath of the most influential news outlets in America was something close to stupefaction. Jeffrey Toobin, chief legal analyst for CNN, appearing on Anderson Cooper's show ""360,"" called the proposed policy ""really grotesque"" after describing the plan as akin to ""using human beings to spread a form of pestilence around the country."" Maggie Haberman, the Pulitzer-winning New York Times correspondent (and Donald Trump savant), tweeted that she had read the Post story twice, leading to a simple reaction: ""It is insane."" On Brian Williams's ""11th Hour"" show on MSNBC, one guest, David Jolly, the one-time Republican congressman, who has renounced fealty to that party in the age of Trump, repeatedly used the word ""sociopathy"" to describe the policy, and said those who had come up with it were displaying ""unmitigated depravity.""

Castro: Trump admin. wants to use cruelty as a weapon 01:24 And then, at least so far, pretty much everybody has gone back to covering the arrest of Julian Assange; the blowback against the attorney general enflaming conspiracy theories about spying on the Trump campaign; the fight over the President's taxes; and, inevitably, the latest polls on the Democratic presidential race. That is: a story that merited almost cartoon-character double-takes of astonishment, marked by extreme verbal descriptions like insanity, grotesquerie and depravity, grabbed, at least for the beginnings of one news cycle, a portion of media attention, before likely getting thrown into the wash of what has become the daily recitation of the gobsmacking news out of the nation's capital. This story was only the most recent example of the now-consuming dilemma that afflicts all media coverage of the current White House administration: How to adequately convey any lasting sense of context amid the swirling hurricane of events transpiring not just daily, but often hourly, piling up upon each other like remnants of coastal buildings swept up in the storm surge. Donald Trump is sabotaging America's democracy By any historical standard, the proposed White House plan to try to inflict some kind of damage on districts hospitable to immigrants by busing masses of detainees to those locations and setting them loose -- like an ""infestation,"" a favorite characterization of this White House about immigrants from Mexico and Central America -- would have unleashed a torrent of intense and sustained high-volume coverage. And viewers and readers encountering widespread analysis of a story marked by terms like insanity and sociopathy would recognize something extraordinary had happened. Instead, the din of incessant political noise can be expected to quickly obliterate any effort to give this latest development what would, in the past, have been its proper due as a screamer of a headline. And context will fly off into the ether. Astonishment will ebb. Media heads will snap back. And the beat goes on: Drums keep pounding rhythm to the brain; ladeda dee; ladeda dah. The Stephen Miller purge of DHS Coincidentally, on Thursday, The Hollywood Reporter released its list of the 35 most powerful people in New York media, an impressive group naturally dominated by the anchors, reporters, editors and executives charged with covering the maelstrom that used to just be called ""news."" (A bunch of late-night stars made their way in there as well, because they too are now caught up in trying to capture a phenomenon unlike anything even comedy has seen before.) Many of these folks are empowered in their efforts by the work of dogged teams of journalists who provide them with material. The magazine began its piece about the list by declaring, ""not since Watergate has the media been more relevant"" and that the names on the list had been chosen for ""their influence over the frenzied conversation that drives the news now."" The media as an institution is certainly relevant. It's more than that; it's indispensable. But the degree of its influence is far less clear, precisely because of the frenzy it's trying to explain. Forget Watergate. That was a giant squid of a story, lots of tentacles coming off a central monster. It was a threat, but a recognizable one, a comprehensible one. Stay up to date...

What's happening now feels more dystopian, a scattered, non-linear narrative impossible to get a consistent fix on, or to approach with traditional, rational reporting and analysis.

What's behind the surging interest in Pete Buttigieg (Opinion),us.cnn.com,Julian Zelizer,04-13-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/opinions/buttigieg-contrast-trump-opinion-zelizer/index.html,"Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author, with Kevin Kruse, of the new book "" Fault Lines: A History of the United States Since 1974. "" Follow him on Twitter at @julianzelizer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
(CNN) It looks like Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- a married, gay millennial whom few voters had heard of until a few months ago -- now has a real shot at the Democratic nomination. Who would have thought that the mayor of South Bend, the fourth largest city in Indiana, could compete in one of the most crowded primary fields ever? Buttigieg, who is expected to formally launch his campaign Sunday, has emerged as a formidable candidate.
Julian Zelizer In retrospect, his unexpected viability makes a lot of sense. Democrats will select their candidate at a very special moment in American history. The outrage over President Donald Trump -- what he stands for and what he is doing with the office -- is immense. Fury over the way he has used his political power and the support he has maintained from a large swath of the American constituency has energized and mobilized Democrats unlike anything in recent history. Democratic Party voters are desperate to believe in the promise of American politics once again. Many live with the sense of disenchantment in the political system as a result of Trump's election. He is the antithesis of the feeling they had on election night 2008, when it appeared that the nation was moving in the right direction on certain basic questions about the character of the country. Buttigieg is appealing to many Democrats because he represents a shift back toward this pre-Trump American character. The mayor is intelligent and thoughtful in contrast to the bombast and bluster coming out of the White House. He seems to believe in rational problem-solving and deliberation, not ongoing Twitter rants and attacks. He comes from a new generation and the very fact that his candidacy is real represents huge steps forward that the nation has taken on basic social issues. He also remains something of a mystery, which allows different parts of the Democratic electorate to see things in him that they like. Then there's his Episcopalian faith, which leans to the left rather than being a cynical conservative tool for achieving power. Buttigieg is a symbol for a rising Christian left While many of the Democratic candidates have qualities that appeal to Democrats, moderates, even some Republicans, Buttigieg seems to have the well-rounded appeal and the right persona to garner the support that has taken others much longer to build. He has the potential to appeal to moderates even as he has taken some specific leftward positions on issues, like eliminating the Electoral College, expanding the size of the Supreme Court , and moving toward a single-payer health care system . Read More Former President Barack Obama's adviser David Axelrod likes to say that voters are often looking for someone who is the opposite of the incumbent. In trying to make sense of the 2016 election, Axelrod wrote in The New York Times that Trump fulfilled the theory of politics he believed in back in 2008: ""Open-seat presidential elections are shaped by perceptions of the style and personality of the outgoing incumbent. Voters rarely seek the replica of what they have. They almost always seek the remedy, the candidate who has the personal qualities the public finds lacking the departing executive."" Although this is not an open-seat election, Buttigieg (among other Democrats) does fulfill this model. The mayor's supporters can look to the fact that there have been a number of instances in recent history in which the candidate with the least name recognition and experience has won the nomination -- and the presidency. Certainly, Democrats can think back to Jimmy Carter in 1976, a nationally unknown governor from Georgia who competed against a field of Democrats with immense experience. ""Jimmy Who Is Running for What!?"" read the headline of the Atlanta Constitution during Carter's candidacy. Pence says Buttigieg bringing 'attacks on my Christian faith' Understanding better than anyone why voters yearned for a candidate whom they could trust and someone who did not seem deeply enmeshed in Washington politics, he won the nomination and he won the presidency. In fact, he titled one of his campaign films "" Jimmy Who? "" just to prove a point. Carter also had a keen feel for the dynamics of the post-1960s news media and nomination process, which helped him figured out how to catapult victories in small contests like Iowa into broad support. Obama had a similar experience in 2008. The senator, without a lengthy record in elected office, took on a political giant, Hillary Clinton. Added to this was the open question of whether the country would vote for an African-American president, which was not clear given our country's long history with racism. In the end, voters gravitated toward Obama, eager for a figure who they could believe in -- one who promised to move the nation beyond the broken, polarized, divisive and dysfunctional world they read about in the news every day. The clarity he showed in his opposition to the Iraq War in 2002 offered a stark contrast to Clinton's middle-of-the-road stand. With the bleak atmosphere created by the ongoing war in Iraq, as well as total collapse of the financial system in the fall of 2008, Obama was a refreshing political figure. And so he won the presidency. Pete Buttigieg's unlikely rise as a symbol of LGBT progress Some would say Trump's nomination and victory also reflects how unpredictable our presidential elections have become and how a candidate who resonates with certain portions of the party can win the nomination despite conventional wisdom. Though there are debates about the sources of the sentiment behind his success, there is agreement that a particular brew of economic and identity anxiety led Republican voters to flock toward him over much more established candidates, like Jeb Bush, providing enough support for Trump to win the Electoral College. We are far from a place where we have a clear picture of what Buttigieg's future holds. This could be a rise-and-fall candidacy that fizzles by the time we are into the summer. We have seen many of those in recent years as well. And Buttigieg still has many questions to answer about the substance of his ideas, his capacity to handle this job given his minimal experience, and whether he has the tenacity to withstand the blistering attacks that will soon be coming his way. He will also face some very strong candidates who are smart, savvy. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

But it would be a mistake to quickly discount the possibility that his campaign can be a formidable one. Not only have we seen similar stories, but we are living in one of those unique moments in which many Americans feel a sense of disillusionment, crisis and fear, like 1976 and 2008. They are desperate to believe things can be different and desperate to believe in the character of politicians. Yes, they want a tough partisan fighter who won't blow the campaign, but they also want that fighter to be someone who inspires them and makes sure that people come out to vote. That feeling is what gives the mayor from South Bend his opening to at least make a serious play for the nomination."
The lesson we can learn from 'Game of Thrones' (opinion),us.cnn.com,Bruce Craven,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/13/opinions/game-of-thrones-resilience-opinion-craven/index.html,"Bruce Craven is the author of ""Win or Die: Leadership Secrets from Game of Thrones."" He is on the Columbia Business School Executive Education faculty and teaches the graduate elective Leadership Through Fiction. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN.
(CNN) This Sunday the curtain rises on the final season of HBO's ""Game of Thrones."" If you aren't already a fan, you will still want to take a seat for the battle between Ice and Fire. The show is a master class in the importance of being resilient. If you are already a fan, you probably know what Arya Stark says when her Braavosi sword-trainer, Syrio Forel, asks, ""What do we say to the God of Death?"" Arya's response is one we all must remember, even if we aren't carrying a sword. Arya answers: ""Not today.""
This line exemplifies the fearless grit that Arya shows as she trains to be an assassin -- and she's not the only character who confronts danger and finds the necessary strength to persevere. Although her sister, Sansa Stark -- who is far more posh and put together -- faces unthinkable psychological and physical abuse, she also finds her way out of her horrible imprisonments and turns adversity in her favor. In the first season, the Stark sisters leave their home in the frigid north, with one hoping to learn to use her sword, while the other plans to marry the dapper Prince Joffrey. The journey south doesn't go well for either of them. In the capital of Westeros, King's Landing, they are forced to confront unthinkable odds. They face brutal situations where it would be understandable to fail and easy to give up. But both young women choose instead to face their challenges and, as the series continues, operate with remarkable resilience. The show, based on George R.R. Martin's epic fantasy series ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" (Bantam Books), is far more violent than what most of us confront in our daily lives, so it might seem like a stretch to compare the fantasy to reality. But if you dig deep into the fictional struggles in Essos and Westeros, you'll find that, even if you don't bring dragons and swords to work, there are parallels to our real life adventures. Looking back on my own life, I can see similar themes. All the latest on the final season of 'Game of Thrones' In the mid-'90s, at age 35, I found myself nearing the end of my first night working at a bar in Manhattan and subleasing an apartment in New York's Lower East Side. The apartment had wood floors that needed varnishing, a toilet in a closet by the front door and a bathtub in the kitchen. Nothing I faced was comparable to the young Stark women's challenging journeys in ""Game of Thrones,"" but I felt the weight of my own recent struggles. I had just returned to New York City after a year of attempting to break into screenwriting in Hollywood. My first novel had been published two years earlier and I thought I could parlay that into a career writing both novels and screenplays. I was wrong. Read More Los Angeles was my hometown, but my move to Hollywood was not unlike Sansa's trip to King's Landing: I was excited about the adventure and expected perfect results. Instead, like many others who attempt to break into a new industry, I found myself in a competitive world and an environment I didn't fully understand. I might not have been confined in the Red Keep, threatened by Queen Cersei, but that didn't mean it was easy. I lost two people close to me that year as I was writing in Hollywood. My former mentor and boss at Columbia Business School, Mary Anne Devanna, passed away. I knew she was ill, but didn't quite understand how serious it was until she phoned me in California and told me about her situation. Then, just like that, she was gone. My good friend, Tim Dwight, was also fighting to stay alive in Santa Monica. He was brave beyond anything I could imagine, but he didn't make it either. 'Game of Thrones' ending comes with HBO at a crossroads That Christmas Eve, I went to bed, feeling like a failure in my professional work. I couldn't make money to sustain myself as a writer. Both a script and a novel had been on the verge of selling, but hadn't sold. I had no money for food, rent or gas for my vintage Mercury, not to mention any cash to buy Christmas gifts for my parents or sisters. My failures felt daunting, but I woke up on Christmas Day and realized it was time to push forward. I had no reason to complain. I had reported to a woman as encouraging as Mary Anne, who helped me learn about business education. I had been chosen as a friend by someone as supportive as Tim, who helped me believe in my writing abilities. The fact they both had passed away too early hurt. It is still with me, but I also felt lucky to have known them. I understood that I was blessed. People in my life believed I could make it, and I needed to keep believing in myself. I realized I was hungry to write more and keep fighting. The fairy tale I had pursued in Hollywood didn't pan out, but I found a new, temporary home for myself back in New York City. I spent some time sleeping on friends' floors before I found that apartment, and worked temp jobs filing microfiche before I started bartending. It wasn't glamorous, but I focused on the positives. I was meeting new, creative people. My battered, poetic apartment was perfect in the cold New York winter, when I could take a hot bath in my kitchen, open the large windows and watch snow drift down from the sky. On sunny days, the apartment was filled with light. There was a tiny black-and-white TV, on which I used to watch ""The Simpsons."" There was a large desk where I could write. And now their watch is ended: How fans are bracing for life after 'Game of Thrones' I kept working toward my goals, even when they seemed out of reach. I had a passion for writing, as Arya had a passion for fighting. And, as I returned to work for Columbia Business School, I found a new passion for teaching leadership. After Sansa's dreams of marrying Prince Joffrey collapsed, she was guided by a new passion to return to Winterfell, and regain her home from those who had hurt her family. My resilience is not comparable to that shown by Arya and Sansa, but I still remind myself that when my back was against the wall as a writer, I chose to soldier on instead of deciding to quit. In life, we all face unforgiving competition, unpredictable adversity, occasional betrayal, and too often: doubt and despair. These are inevitable roadblocks on the long journey of pursuing our goals. This will happen if we compete to win.
As ""Game of Thrones"" comes to an end with its last season, we should all come away having learned a lesson from the Stark sisters. We don't know what the final season will bring for them, but we do know that both Arya and Sansa found a way to live with passion and perseverance in a brutally competitive environment. They remind us that even though the fairy tale may not last, we can choose to operate with grit and resilience in the face of adversity."

The suspect, Austin Smith, 30, returned home from a bar Thursday night and confronted his wife over accusations that she had cheated on him, which she denied, according to CNN affiliate KNXV. He then killed his wife and two daughters at the family home and drove to the apartment of the man he believed she was having an affair with, said Sgt. Tommy Thompson of the Phoenix Police Department. There, he fatally shot the man and injured two others, he said. Police: One daughter survived Read More His wife, Dasia Patterson, 29, and their daughters Mayan Smith, 7, and Nasha Smith, 5, were found dead in the family's home, police said. His 3-year-old daughter was hiding under a bed when police arrived and was not injured, Thompson said. The suspect told police that he chose not to kill her because she ""reminded him of himself,"" the affiliate reported, citing court documents. Police said the older daughter died of blunt force trauma, and the suspect told investigators that he allegedly killed her because she was crying. Patterson's relatives said they are devastated and struggling to come to terms with the loss. ""We are in anguish over the senseless loss of our beloved Dasia and her young children,"" her family said in a statement. ""As we try to process our profound grief, our focus is on the welfare of her sole surviving 3-year-old daughter. She just lost her mother and sisters, and we want nothing more than for her to be with her family right now."" A second crime scene After killing his family, Smith drove to an apartment complex in Phoenix and fatally shot Ron Freeman, 46, whom he accused of having an affair with his wife, police said. In addition to Freeman, he allegedly shot two other people at the home -- a man and a woman -- who have not been identified. The woman, 47, is in critical condition while the man, 33, suffered serious injuries. Police received a call about the shooting at the apartment and found the suspect's car fleeing the scene when they arrived, Thompson said. ""The car was stopped a short distance from the scene ... and the suspect, Austin Smith was taken into custody without incident,"" he added. At the scene of the second shooting, one of the victims expressed concern for the suspect's family. When officers did a welfare check on the suspect's family, they found his deceased wife and two children. During an interview with investigators at the Phoenix Police headquarters, the suspect said ""the reason he shot these individuals is because in God's eyes it was all right for him to deal with someone in this manner,"" Thompson said. ""He admitted to the crimes and said he believed his wife Dasia had cheated with Ron. Austin stated that God had told him to do the things he did,"" he said. Smith was booked into the Maricopa County Jail and charged with four counts of first degree murder, two counts of attempted first degree murder and three counts of aggravated assault. Information on his attorney was not immediately available."

She is also the co-author of an upcoming book, 'The Daughters of Chibok,'. Audu Bulama Bukarti is a human rights lawyer who works as an analyst at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change.
Both are studying a Ph.D. with a focus on Boko Haram. They have written this commentary to mark the five year anniversary of the Chibok kidnappings.
The views expressed in the commentary are theirs alone.
(CNN) On 14 April 2014, Boko Haram, the violent extremist group operating in the Lake Chad region, abducted 276 girls from their school dormitory in north-eastern Nigeria-- an incident that catapulted the group to global attention.
Astonishingly, 57 of the girls managed to escape en route, but the group would eventually confine 219 of them in Nigeria's vast Sambisa forest, its base since 2009. The administration of Nigeria's President Jonathan initially denied the atrocity had happened, which fed the outrage from which the #BringBackOurGirls movement was born. A resistance led by Nigerian women and fuelled by social media, the campaign brought unprecedented international attention to the girls' plight. The world rallied; the Archbishop of Canterbury flew to Abuja to pray for the girls and their families, while Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai called them her ""sisters."" Then US first lady Michelle Obama, said she saw her ""own daughters"" in them and Hollywood stars lent their voices to the movement. Read More Out of the 219 girls stolen by Boko Haram, 107 have so far made it home: four of them by Nigerian military/ para-military intervention, and 21 of them were initially released in October 2016 after negotiations between the Buhari administration and Boko Haram, 82 more would later be freed in May 2017.

Hide Caption 11 of 11 Since then, nothing more has been heard of the remaining 112 young women and five years on, the Chibok girls are no longer newsworthy. Governments have changed, memories have faded, and new priorities set. The Chibok girls who in 2014 were poster-children of globalized outrage are now faint memories, consigned to the fringes of concern and relegated to the bottom of the agenda. It was a reassuring moment for both the girls and their parents when President Buhari stated in his inaugural address on May 29, 2015: ""We cannot claim to have defeated Boko Haram without rescuing the Chibok girls and all other innocent persons held hostage by insurgents."" In Abuja, Nigeria's capital and seat of political power, the initial promising negotiations have long since stalled. The diminished interest and lack of public outrage over the Chibok girls is dramatized by the undulating fortunes of their parents since 2014. Yana Galang's daughter Rifkatu was 16 when she was taken and is one of the 112 still missing, the last time we spoke she asked the most important and as yet unanswered question: ""How could the world forget our children if they truly saw in them their own daughters or sisters?"" She reinforces that it is completely different for a mother. From her clothes to her cooking pots, everything around Yana reminds her of Rifkatu who she last saw when she went to school to write her final year school examinations five years ago. UNICEF: Boko Haram has kidnapped more than 1000 children in Nigeria Rifkatu was snatched from high school just before graduation, at a time when her mother thought the hardest part of her work was ""almost done."" Her memories pervade her mother's being, even in public places. The other day, Galang heard Rifkatu's favorite song from a passing vehicle, ""instantly, tears started pouring from my eyes,"" she says. The stark injustice of it all however for Yana is reflected in the divergence in the fortunes of those whose daughters have been returned to them and those who still pine for theirs, which threatens to fracture her community, if it has not already. She tells of the stigmatization of their daughters still in captivity as ""bad girls"" who chose to stay with Boko Haram, reflecting the group's public narrative that the remaining girls elected to stay with them. ""We are social pariahs,"" she complained as she fights back more tears of frustration. For these mothers, the pain which started five years ago is as excruciating as ever and the memories as fresh as when the heart-breaking news of this extreme act of misogyny was first broken. They feel forgotten by a country and a world that vowed to stand with them till the end. For the next few decades, Nigeria must not only confront the challenge of reconstructing communities but rebuild trust with victims and also address the residual and deep communal trauma. Nigeria's Vice President was a special guest recently at the 25th national commemoration of the Rwandan genocide, where, despite challenges, significant progress has been made in sowing the seed of national unity and love in a country that faced one of the worst horrors in modern history . Abuja can and should learn lessons from the experience in Kigali. Five years on, Nigeria and the international community must renew their efforts to reunite these girls and every person in the grip of Boko Haram with their families. The Buhari administration has demonstrated its strong commitment towards this goal and should put it on the agenda for the reported dialogue between the government and the group. Five years ago, the world was united in horror and outrage but has since fallen silent. We do not know the fate of these 112 young women, and the ugly truth is that not all may have survived. But we owe it to them, to Yana and all their families to work together to set them free."
"Theresa May cannot come back from her Easter ""holiday"" empty-handed",edition.cnn.com,"Analysis by Jane Merrick, CNN",04-14-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/14/uk/theresa-may-brexit-easter-break-gbr-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) Sending lawmakers off on an unexpected Easter break after the Brexit deadline was extended for six months, Theresa May told them to use the opportunity to ""reflect"" on how to get out of the current stalemate that has left the UK in limbo.
For herself, the Prime Minister is thought to be taking a few days off -- perhaps on one of her favorite walking holidays with her husband -- before returning to Westminster, clear-headed and refreshed, to try to finally find a deal on Brexit. And yet, arguably, while she deserves the break, leaving the scene is the last thing she should be doing right now. The decision by EU leaders to extend the deadline for Brexit until October 31, at the end of a fraught summit that ran into the early hours of Thursday morning, was akin to a pressure valve being released in Westminster. British Prime Minister Theresa May leaving a European Council meeting on Brexit at The European Parliament in Brussels on April 11. Lawmakers tired and -- in some reported cases, ill -- from the repeated late nights and close-run votes on Brexit were relieved that the Easter recess, which had been canceled to try to reach a deal before the old deadline of Friday April 12, was back on. It is their first break since Christmas. Brexit battles are about to get much bloodier Yet that release of pressure has created a vacuum into which the more hardcore Brexit enthusiasts have rushed to seize the agenda from the Prime Minister. Read More On Friday Nigel Farage, who as UKIP leader was at the forefront of the campaign to leave the EU, launched his new Brexit Party's campaign for the European elections. Prominent Conservative Brexiteers who have their eyes on the leadership and job of Prime Minister when May finally steps down are also staying around to get their slice of the agenda. Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary and now a leading contender to succeed May, has been in secret talks with the pro-Brexit Northern Ireland party the DUP, which holds the balance of power in the Commons. Ambition never sleeps. Nigel Farage speaks at the launch of the Brexit Party in Coventry, England. Although May needed more time to secure a compromise on Brexit, this vacuum is a dangerous period -- even for the Prime Minister who has survived many parliamentary defeats and attempts to unseat her. While the Brexit process was in a state of deadlock, May nevertheless had some control over that deadlock. She could not find a way out, but at least she was the one dictating the terms of the talks with the Labour Party, the person representing the UK at that Brussels summit, and, to some extent, in control of the news agenda. Halloween Brexit delay could mean a summer nightmare for Theresa May By taking her foot off the gas -- even temporarily -- May has let other, louder voices overtake her. If she wants to take back control, to borrow a phrase from Brexit campaigners, she should not stay away for long. While Westminster was in stasis, it suited the PM, relatively speaking. Now there is more time on the Brexit countdown clock, anything could happen. Crucially, the Prime Minister needs to redouble the efforts of talks between the government and Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party to reach a compromise deal that will have enough votes in the Commons to enable Brexit to take place. Talks between the UK government and Jeremy Corbyn's opposition Labour party are ongoing, to try to find a Brexit solution. Those talks are ongoing between ministers and Corbyn's representatives, but they can't be allowed to dwindle to nothing just because Parliament is on a time-out. Brexit delay is more bad news for UK business May needs to take charge of them personally and to make a breakthrough by next weekend, before the Commons returns the following week -- to not only prove to Brussels she is making real progress but also to prevent a challenge to her own leadership by increasingly rebellious Brexiteer Conservatives. If they fail, she must either press again for her original deal, or accept that lawmakers should have another attempt at indicative votes to come up with the most popular alternative. If she can't prove she has an answer, there will be a concerted attempt by her own party to force her to resign. The next official deadline for Brexit is June, when the UK must produce a progress report to EU leaders on how it's trying to solve the Brexit deadlock. But in reality, the date looming for the Prime Minister is April 23, when Parliament returns. She cannot come back from her ""holiday"" empty-handed."

Yet his rise from obscurity to president wasn't all on the up and up. Getting the Republican Party's nomination in 1860 and then defeating Democrat Stephen Douglas involved some sly political moves by Lincoln's team. Here's a look at some lesser known facts about this larger-than-life leader: He wasn't above 'dirty politics' Lincoln's 1858 Senate race against Douglas was dirty: Douglas even encouraged votes by providing liquor to those who supported him. It was a devastating loss for Lincoln -- but when he sought the Republican presidential nomination two years later, he didn't shy away from such maneuvers in his campaign.

Retracing Lincoln's final hours 02:25 Lincoln secretly purchased a German-language newspaper featuring favorable articles about him to help curry favor among its readers, mostly immigrant voters, Lincoln scholar and biographer Harold Holzer pointed out in a CNN essay . Ahead of the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln's campaign team, led by Judge David Davis , met with delegation leaders, sometimes promising Cabinet-level positions in exchange for support for Lincoln. ""They worked their way into every nook, cranny and snook-filled hall they could,"" said Allen Guelzo , author of several books on Lincoln and a professor at Gettysburg College. Lincoln's campaign aides even printed out 5,000 counterfeit tickets to the Republican convention to pack the halls with his supporters. ""Make no mistake, Abraham Lincoln was chief political strategist: He relied on his aides maybe sometimes to do the dirty work, to be ruthless, to cut deals, but he was the lead dog,"" said David Plouffe, President Barack Obama's campaign manager in 2008. He contemplated sending freed slaves back to Africa Lincoln was firmly against slavery -- yet his position on what should happen to freed slaves wasn't so clear. ""The problem arises with the next question: What do you do with slavery, given that it's unjust?"" historian and author Eric Foner told NPR .

Why Lincoln ended slavery 01:22 He wavered on his views of what should be done with freed slaves. Even his historic Emancipation Proclamation , which he delivered as President in 1863, stopped short of granting citizenship or any other rights to African-Americans -- stating only that freed slaves should be paid ""reasonable wages"" for their work and should be allowed to serve in the U.S. military. ""Lincoln does not really see black people as an intrinsic part of American society,"" said Foner, who outlined Lincoln's evolving views on slavery in his book "" The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery. "" ""They are kind of an alien group who have been uprooted from their own society and unjustly brought across the ocean. 'Send them back to Africa,' he says (in an 1854 speech). And this was not an unusual position at this time."" As a candidate for Senate in 1858, Lincoln stated during his fourth debate with Douglas, ""I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races."" But his views evolved over time. And Foner said that the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves in 10 rebellious Southern states, ""completely repudiates all of those previous ideas for Lincoln."" He ran for the U.S. Senate twice -- and lost both times If you thought Lincoln was a U.S. senator before he got to the White House -- well, you're not the only one . Lincoln served in the Illinois House of Representatives for four terms before seeking higher office.

Douglas accuses Lincoln of 'race hate' 01:19 Despite his clear victory over political rival Douglas in the famed debates of 1858, he also lost that Senate race to Douglas. Word got around about the passionate politician and his powerful anti-slavery speeches at those debates. ""Newspapers across the country that had begun reporting the debates in August in order to cover Douglas ended in November by featuring Lincoln,"" Guelzo wrote . ""Lincoln gained a national reputation that it would have been impossible to acquire in any other way."" Lincoln was invited to speak at a Republican event in New York's Cooper Union in February 1860 -- and delivered an impressive speech that Holzer noted ""dramatically catapulted (him) toward the White House."" With his star on the rise, Lincoln still smarted from his Senate losses. In 1859 he told a fellow Illinois congressman, ""I would rather have a full term in the Senate than in the presidency."" He most likely suffered from clinical depression Joshua Wolf Shenk, author of "" Lincoln's Melancholy, "" analyzed the work of historians who reviewed the original accounts of the men and women who knew Lincoln the best. These scholars surmised that Lincoln's widely reported ""melancholy"" had all the signs of the three major stages of depression: fear, engagement and transcendence. ""He often wept in public and recited maudlin poetry,"" Shenk wrote in The Atlantic . ""He told jokes and stories at odd times -- he needed the laughs, he said, for his survival. ""As a young man he talked more than once of suicide, and as he grew older he said he saw the world as hard and grim, full of misery, made that way by fate and the forces of God."" He was aware of an assassination plot against him Four years before John Wilkes Booth famously shot and killed Lincoln on April 14, 1865, the newly elected U.S. leader was fully aware his political enemies had been plotting his death.

Lincoln even hinted at his awareness of this danger during a speech at Philadelphia's Independence Hall in February 1861 as he tried in vain to prevent a civil war: ""If this country cannot be saved without giving up that principle (of liberty, outlined by the Declaration of Independence), I was about to say I would rather be assassinated on this spot than surrender it.""

Although eight of 12 riders finished the jump-off with clear rounds, Guery was one of the few competitors who went for broke, beating Said and Venise de Reverdy with a tight turn into the final fence. ""I knew my horse has a big canter, and I wanted to use it on the big arena like this,"" Guery said about his elegant stallion. ""I think I won on the two last ones, because I really pushed and the horse listened to me perfectly. There is not many horses like this. This really is a superstar."" Mexico City is the second stop of the 20-leg 2019 Global Champions Tour. Guery's victory moved him up to joint seventh spot in the overall LGCT rankings, alongside France's Julien Epaillard, with 40 points. Fellow Belgian Niels Bruynseels is the overall leader with 55 points, followed by Germany's Daniel Deusser on 52 points. Another Belgian, Pieter de Vos, is tied for third in the overall standings on 48 points with Britain's Ben Maher. ""I'm very happy,"" said Bruynseels, who finished in 11th place in Mexico City. ""To be the leader of the ranking of competitions with the best riders, best horses and best shows in the world is something very special."" READ: Epaillard edges Ben Maher in opener in Doha There was disappointment in the Mexican capital for Maher, the defending overall LGCT champion, who failed to reach the jump-off after his horse, Madame X, produced 12 penalties. Maher, who dominated the tour last year with his wonder horse Explosion W had started the 2019 season with a runner-up place last month in Doha to Epaillard. Scott Brash, last year's Mexico City winner, riding Hello Senator also had three rails down, leaving no British riders in the jump-off. The Shanghai Swans on the top of the podium in Mexico City. Global Champions League Earlier in the day, Shanghai Swans continued their perfect start to the 2019 season with a second straight win in the Global Champions League team competition. With seven teams separated by just eight seconds after the first round, over a course designed by Javier Trenor, there was everything to play for in the second round. Valkenswaard United had been in pole position after the first outing on Friday as Bertram Allen, with Molly Malone V, and Alberto Zorzi, aboard Contanga, finished the course close to two seconds faster than their nearest rivals, Paris Panthers and Shanghai Swans. But United were eliminated in a dramatic second round on Saturday after Zorzi was forced to retire when Contanga pulled up injured. That allowed the Swans to follow up their win in Doha last month with victory in Mexico City as Sweden's Peder Fredricson, Ireland's Shane Sweetnam and Deusser produced a total of four penalties, one clear of the Hamburg Giants and four ahead of the Monaco Aces. ""My horse jumped great today,"" said Fredricson, the star performer of the Shanghai Swans with two clear rounds on two different horses. ""For a speed class, it was quite a big track. Of course, the pressure of the team and everything, everything adds up. That's what makes it so good."" Miami Beach The Tour heads to Miami Beach for its third leg next week with the Swans looking to extend their lead in the overall classification over their nearest rivals, the New York Empire. ""It's a good start, we to try hold on the whole season,"" said Fredricson, the reigning European champion. His teammate Deuser added: ""This was really a team win."" ""We have a strong team and the expectations are high, but in the end we really had to do it over two rounds. We are going with a lot of confidence in the next leg."""
"Phoenix man killed his wife, 2 children and another man over affair suspicions, police say - CNN",us.cnn.com,Faith Karimi,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/14/us/phoenix-man-kills-wife-and-children-over-affair-allegations/index.html,"(CNN) A Phoenix man killed four people, including his wife and two children, in a shooting rampage that started as a domestic dispute over allegations of an affair, police said.
The suspect, Austin Smith, 30, returned home from a bar Thursday night and confronted his wife over accusations that she had cheated on him, which she denied, according to CNN affiliate KNXV. He then killed his wife and two daughters at the family home and drove to the apartment of the man he believed she was having an affair with, said Sgt. Tommy Thompson of the Phoenix Police Department. There, he fatally shot the man and injured two others, he said. Police: One daughter survived Read More His wife, Dasia Patterson, 29, and their daughters Mayan Smith, 7, and Nasha Smith, 5, were found dead in the family's home, police said. His 3-year-old daughter was hiding under a bed when police arrived and was not injured, Thompson said. The suspect told police that he chose not to kill her because she ""reminded him of himself,"" the affiliate reported, citing court documents. Police said the older daughter died of blunt force trauma, and the suspect told investigators that he allegedly killed her because she was crying. Patterson's relatives said they are devastated and struggling to come to terms with the loss. ""We are in anguish over the senseless loss of our beloved Dasia and her young children,"" her family said in a statement. ""As we try to process our profound grief, our focus is on the welfare of her sole surviving 3-year-old daughter. She just lost her mother and sisters, and we want nothing more than for her to be with her family right now."" A second crime scene After killing his family, Smith drove to an apartment complex in Phoenix and fatally shot Ron Freeman, 46, whom he accused of having an affair with his wife, police said. In addition to Freeman, he allegedly shot two other people at the home -- a man and a woman -- who have not been identified. The woman, 47, is in critical condition while the man, 33, suffered serious injuries. Police received a call about the shooting at the apartment and found the suspect's car fleeing the scene when they arrived, Thompson said. ""The car was stopped a short distance from the scene ... and the suspect, Austin Smith was taken into custody without incident,"" he added. At the scene of the second shooting, one of the victims expressed concern for the suspect's family. When officers did a welfare check on the suspect's family, they found his deceased wife and two children. During an interview with investigators at the Phoenix Police headquarters, the suspect said ""the reason he shot these individuals is because in God's eyes it was all right for him to deal with someone in this manner,"" Thompson said. ""He admitted to the crimes and said he believed his wife Dasia had cheated with Ron. Austin stated that God had told him to do the things he did,"" he said. Smith was booked into the Maricopa County Jail and charged with four counts of first degree murder, two counts of attempted first degree murder and three counts of aggravated assault. Information on his attorney was not immediately available."
Abraham Lincoln: 5 surprising facts - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Tricia Escobedo,04-14-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/14/politics/abraham-lincoln-facts/index.html,"A version of this article first published in 2016
(CNN) There's little doubt that Abraham Lincoln was one of the most influential and important leaders ever elected to the White House.
Yet his rise from obscurity to president wasn't all on the up and up. Getting the Republican Party's nomination in 1860 and then defeating Democrat Stephen Douglas involved some sly political moves by Lincoln's team. Here's a look at some lesser known facts about this larger-than-life leader: He wasn't above 'dirty politics' Lincoln's 1858 Senate race against Douglas was dirty: Douglas even encouraged votes by providing liquor to those who supported him. It was a devastating loss for Lincoln -- but when he sought the Republican presidential nomination two years later, he didn't shy away from such maneuvers in his campaign. Read More ""Even our greatest president, our most honest president wasn't above a little dirty politics,"" said Paul Begala, a CNN contributor who was senior strategist for President Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign.

Retracing Lincoln's final hours 02:25 Lincoln secretly purchased a German-language newspaper featuring favorable articles about him to help curry favor among its readers, mostly immigrant voters, Lincoln scholar and biographer Harold Holzer pointed out in a CNN essay . Ahead of the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln's campaign team, led by Judge David Davis , met with delegation leaders, sometimes promising Cabinet-level positions in exchange for support for Lincoln. ""They worked their way into every nook, cranny and snook-filled hall they could,"" said Allen Guelzo , author of several books on Lincoln and a professor at Gettysburg College. Lincoln's campaign aides even printed out 5,000 counterfeit tickets to the Republican convention to pack the halls with his supporters. ""Make no mistake, Abraham Lincoln was chief political strategist: He relied on his aides maybe sometimes to do the dirty work, to be ruthless, to cut deals, but he was the lead dog,"" said David Plouffe, President Barack Obama's campaign manager in 2008. He contemplated sending freed slaves back to Africa Lincoln was firmly against slavery -- yet his position on what should happen to freed slaves wasn't so clear. ""The problem arises with the next question: What do you do with slavery, given that it's unjust?"" historian and author Eric Foner told NPR . ""Lincoln took a very long time to try to figure out exactly what steps ought to be taken."" JUST WATCHED Why Lincoln ended slavery Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Why Lincoln ended slavery 01:22 He wavered on his views of what should be done with freed slaves. Even his historic Emancipation Proclamation , which he delivered as President in 1863, stopped short of granting citizenship or any other rights to African-Americans -- stating only that freed slaves should be paid ""reasonable wages"" for their work and should be allowed to serve in the U.S. military. ""Lincoln does not really see black people as an intrinsic part of American society,"" said Foner, who outlined Lincoln's evolving views on slavery in his book "" The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery. "" ""They are kind of an alien group who have been uprooted from their own society and unjustly brought across the ocean. 'Send them back to Africa,' he says (in an 1854 speech). And this was not an unusual position at this time."" As a candidate for Senate in 1858, Lincoln stated during his fourth debate with Douglas, ""I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races."" But his views evolved over time. And Foner said that the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves in 10 rebellious Southern states, ""completely repudiates all of those previous ideas for Lincoln."" He ran for the U.S. Senate twice -- and lost both times If you thought Lincoln was a U.S. senator before he got to the White House -- well, you're not the only one . Lincoln served in the Illinois House of Representatives for four terms before seeking higher office. After a single term in the U.S. House, he first ran for a Senate seat in 1845 -- a race he lost by five votes. JUST WATCHED Douglas accuses Lincoln of 'race hate' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Douglas accuses Lincoln of 'race hate' 01:19 Despite his clear victory over political rival Douglas in the famed debates of 1858, he also lost that Senate race to Douglas. Word got around about the passionate politician and his powerful anti-slavery speeches at those debates. ""Newspapers across the country that had begun reporting the debates in August in order to cover Douglas ended in November by featuring Lincoln,"" Guelzo wrote . ""Lincoln gained a national reputation that it would have been impossible to acquire in any other way."" Lincoln was invited to speak at a Republican event in New York's Cooper Union in February 1860 -- and delivered an impressive speech that Holzer noted ""dramatically catapulted (him) toward the White House."" With his star on the rise, Lincoln still smarted from his Senate losses. In 1859 he told a fellow Illinois congressman, ""I would rather have a full term in the Senate than in the presidency."" He most likely suffered from clinical depression Joshua Wolf Shenk, author of "" Lincoln's Melancholy, "" analyzed the work of historians who reviewed the original accounts of the men and women who knew Lincoln the best. These scholars surmised that Lincoln's widely reported ""melancholy"" had all the signs of the three major stages of depression: fear, engagement and transcendence. ""He often wept in public and recited maudlin poetry,"" Shenk wrote in The Atlantic . ""He told jokes and stories at odd times -- he needed the laughs, he said, for his survival. ""As a young man he talked more than once of suicide, and as he grew older he said he saw the world as hard and grim, full of misery, made that way by fate and the forces of God."" He was aware of an assassination plot against him Four years before John Wilkes Booth famously shot and killed Lincoln on April 14, 1865, the newly elected U.S. leader was fully aware his political enemies had been plotting his death. Those entrusted with his security had tried to persuade Lincoln to reschedule a multicity train tour leading up to his March 1861 inauguration in Washington.

An actor, a president and the crime of the 19th century 02:39 A detective hired by the railway ""told Lincoln in blunt terms that if he kept to the published schedule, 'an assault of some kind would be made upon his person with a view to taking his life,' "" Daniel Stashower wrote in Smithsonian Magazine . Lincoln even hinted at his awareness of this danger during a speech at Philadelphia's Independence Hall in February 1861 as he tried in vain to prevent a civil war: ""If this country cannot be saved without giving up that principle (of liberty, outlined by the Declaration of Independence), I was about to say I would rather be assassinated on this spot than surrender it."" Lincoln agreed to continue his journey in an unmarked train car. Aware that secessionist plotters wanted to prevent Lincoln's inauguration, army soldiers were dispatched along Pennsylvania Avenue as additional security."
