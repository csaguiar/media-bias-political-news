Biological processes cannot be perfect, and work from Cristian Tomasetti and Bert Vogelstein from Johns Hopkins a few years ago showed that up to two-thirds of human cancers may be due to DNA replication errors that cannot be avoided as we all grow and then age. Of course it’s up to us to reduce the remaining third by avoiding tobacco..."
